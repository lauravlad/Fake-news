Warren Entsch repeated calls for an independent investigation into how the Association for the Conservation of Threatened Parrots was able to receive hundreds of rare and endangered birds from Australia, after its founder, Martin Guth, used a social media post to say more endangered species had arrived at its facilities in January. Labor\u2019s environment spokesman, Tony Burke, called on the environment minister, Melissa Price, to explain the \u201cbizarre\u201d case and the Greens urged an immediate suspension of any further shipments. A six-month Guardian investigation revealed in December that the environment department had approved the transfer of more than 200 birds to ACTP over three years on the grounds they would be used for a zoo exhibition. But the organisation has no facilities that are freely open to the public, and private messages on social media show native Australian birds apparently from ACTP have been offered for sale for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The German federal agency for nature conservation has said it was aware of those offers. In a post on his personal Facebook page in late January, Guth said two more \u201cvery rare and amazing species\u201d had arrived from Australia. The species are the Baudin\u2019s black cockatoo, which is nationally listed as a vulnerable species and requires a special agreement between the government, exporter and importer, and a subspecies of the sulphur-crested cockatoo, which Guth\u2019s post claimed had never been outside of Australia. \u201cI know I should not post it, just to not make all the haters happy!\u201d the post said. \u201cBut I love birds like we all do!\u201d It continued: \u201cI was waiting long time to get those species in!\u201d Australia\u2019s environment department issued a permit in November for the export of 64 more birds to ACTP. The permit included Baudin\u2019s black cockatoos and sulphur-crested cockatoos, Naretha bluebonnets and endangered Carnaby\u2019s black cockatoos. Guardian Australia asked the department if it had considered cancelling the permit and was told it was still valid. A spokeswoman said the department had received formal notification in December that 34 of the birds had shipped to Germany, including two endangered Carnaby\u2019s black cockatoos, six yellow-tailed black cockatoos and five Macleay\u2019s fig parrots. She said the department was reviewing information about ACTP \u201cto assess if an investigation is warranted under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999\u201d. In late December Guth told the German regional TV broadcaster RBB that ACTP had no restrictions on its dealings in Australian birds. \u201cIt means we are allowed to offer them \u2026 and we are allowed to sell Australian birds,\u201d a translation of the interview said. The export permits issued by the Australian department, along with correspondence between the department, ACTP and Germany\u2019s federal agency for nature conservation, state the birds and their offspring were not to be sold. But the Germany agency has since said there were no limits on trade as far as it was concerned.

Then I felt I couldn\u2019t talk about it as marriage equality became closer because the relationship had ended.</p> <p>While all my partnered friends were taking to social media sharing their stories of love and using these personal anecdotes to help sway voters, for the first time in eight years I felt as though I couldn\u2019t contribute. It was a strange identity loss that I hadn\u2019t expected to be amplified through the plebiscite campaign.</p> <p>No longer could I share the incredible photos of me looking handsome in a tailored suit and my bride looking beautiful in her white gown as proof that \u201clove exists\u201d. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable sharing stories of the previous eight years, from falling in love with my roommate, to moving states together and enduring all the hardships that couples go through over the years only to come out victorious through it all.</p> <p>I could only sit in silence through the conversations hoping no one who knew would bring it up. On reflection though, why couldn\u2019t I have these conversations or share these photos and memories?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/australia-books-blog/2018/apr/26/why-are-millennials-still-getting-married\">Why are millennials still getting married? | Bridie Jabour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After all, heterosexuals have been divorcing since the 1500s. Why was my story of gay divorce not one to share during this time? My wife had rejected my suggestion to get \u201creal married\u201d during our honeymoon in Hawaii, so we ended up not having to go through a \u201creal divorce\u201d, but many people weren\u2019t so lucky.</p> <p>Since the <a href=\"https://www.ag.gov.au/marriageequality\">Marriage Act</a> was redefined to be \u201cthe union of two people to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life\u201d, while a lot of queer people and allies have been celebrating the right to marry, I\u2019m finding myself thinking more about a right we didn\u2019t talk much about: the right to divorce.</p> <p>Going through a breakup is hard enough but imagine knowing or maybe finding out through the process, that you\u2019re stuck in a legal loophole. For all those couples rejoicing the fact that their overseas marriages to their same-sex partner were finally being recognised at home, there were those celebrating the recognition of divorce.</p> <p>Had we married in Hawaii we\u2019d have a situation where we\u2019d have split up and then had our marriage legally recognised by the change in laws in Australia and been forced through a formal divorce. The thought of being legally married after a split is distressing but it\u2019s something that many couples would have gone through. </p> <p>As the people I went to high school with, teachers, old colleagues and many others who were silent all those years ago when I came out started changing their Facebook picture frames to a rainbow \u201cVote Yes\u201d image and shared positive articles about gay marriage or horrific stories of queer people being treated poorly by businesses in the wedding industry, it felt particularly important to prove that they\u2019d chosen the right side.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/17/after-a-bruising-year-the-kindness-of-strangers-made-our-wedding-unforgettable\">After a bruising year, the kindness of strangers made our wedding unforgettable | Kat Patrick</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I never expected to be someone to get married in the first place, so it came as a shock to me when on the cusp of 24 I found myself proposing to my long-term girlfriend. There was so much vocal celebration for our engagement and even more so at, and after, the wedding. Yet the decision I made to split up, just months before my 29th birthday, would ultimately be the best one I\u2019d make for myself and my relationship, and no one celebrated.</p> <p>There were no congratulations on the divorce, no divorce parties where my friends could contribute to pay for half the shit I\u2019d just lost. I had some quiet conversations with my best friend who was proud of my decision. And it took a year, but I finally got \u201cgood at being single\u201d.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never been happier and I make a point of saying this regularly, not because I need to convince myself but I feel like I need to convince those around me.</p> <p>I\u2019ve come to new realisations about marriage equality. When I was first fighting for it, making creative signs for rallies that said things like \u201cYou can marry your cousin, but I can\u2019t marry my girlfriend?\u201d and \u201cLegalise gay marriage \u2026 my arms are sore\u201d, I was doing it for the very selfish and personal reason of my desire to get married. I wanted what my heterosexual peers had. I wanted to wear my wedding ring with pride, share the photos of the big day and have water cooler conversations about the things \u201cmy wife\u201d did that made me proud, all without wondering if they were thinking \u201cyeah it\u2019s not real though, is it?\u201d</p> <p>Since the divorce, the right to marry has taken on a whole new meaning for me. One that those fighting for my rights had no doubt been thinking about all along. It\u2019s not about the right to get married. It\u2019s not even really about the right to get divorced. It\u2019s about the right. The human right to be treated the same as anyone else. The right to have the option.</p> <ul> <li><p>Candice Gallimore is a comedy performer and writer who lives in Sydney with a day job in marketing.</p></li> <li><p>Comments on this article will be premoderated to ensure they stay on topic.</p></li> </ul>",

Then I felt I couldn\u2019t talk about it as marriage equality became closer because the relationship had ended. While all my partnered friends were taking to social media sharing their stories of love and using these personal anecdotes to help sway voters, for the first time in eight years I felt as though I couldn\u2019t contribute. It was a strange identity loss that I hadn\u2019t expected to be amplified through the plebiscite campaign. No longer could I share the incredible photos of me looking handsome in a tailored suit and my bride looking beautiful in her white gown as proof that \u201clove exists\u201d. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable sharing stories of the previous eight years, from falling in love with my roommate, to moving states together and enduring all the hardships that couples go through over the years only to come out victorious through it all. I could only sit in silence through the conversations hoping no one who knew would bring it up. On reflection though, why couldn\u2019t I have these conversations or share these photos and memories? After all, heterosexuals have been divorcing since the 1500s. Why was my story of gay divorce not one to share during this time? My wife had rejected my suggestion to get \u201creal married\u201d during our honeymoon in Hawaii, so we ended up not having to go through a \u201creal divorce\u201d, but many people weren\u2019t so lucky. Since the Marriage Act was redefined to be \u201cthe union of two people to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life\u201d, while a lot of queer people and allies have been celebrating the right to marry, I\u2019m finding myself thinking more about a right we didn\u2019t talk much about: the right to divorce. Going through a breakup is hard enough but imagine knowing or maybe finding out through the process, that you\u2019re stuck in a legal loophole. For all those couples rejoicing the fact that their overseas marriages to their same-sex partner were finally being recognised at home, there were those celebrating the recognition of divorce. Had we married in Hawaii we\u2019d have a situation where we\u2019d have split up and then had our marriage legally recognised by the change in laws in Australia and been forced through a formal divorce. The thought of being legally married after a split is distressing but it\u2019s something that many couples would have gone through. As the people I went to high school with, teachers, old colleagues and many others who were silent all those years ago when I came out started changing their Facebook picture frames to a rainbow \u201cVote Yes\u201d image and shared positive articles about gay marriage or horrific stories of queer people being treated poorly by businesses in the wedding industry, it felt particularly important to prove that they\u2019d chosen the right side. I never expected to be someone to get married in the first place, so it came as a shock to me when on the cusp of 24 I found myself proposing to my long-term girlfriend. There was so much vocal celebration for our engagement and even more so at, and after, the wedding. Yet the decision I made to split up, just months before my 29th birthday, would ultimately be the best one I\u2019d make for myself and my relationship, and no one celebrated. There were no congratulations on the divorce, no divorce parties where my friends could contribute to pay for half the shit I\u2019d just lost. I had some quiet conversations with my best friend who was proud of my decision. And it took a year, but I finally got \u201cgood at being single\u201d. I\u2019ve never been happier and I make a point of saying this regularly, not because I need to convince myself but I feel like I need to convince those around me. I\u2019ve come to new realisations about marriage equality. When I was first fighting for it, making creative signs for rallies that said things like \u201cYou can marry your cousin, but I can\u2019t marry my girlfriend?\u201d and \u201cLegalise gay marriage \u2026 my arms are sore\u201d, I was doing it for the very selfish and personal reason of my desire to get married. I wanted what my heterosexual peers had. I wanted to wear my wedding ring with pride, share the photos of the big day and have water cooler conversations about the things \u201cmy wife\u201d did that made me proud, all without wondering if they were thinking \u201cyeah it\u2019s not real though, is it?\u201d Since the divorce, the right to marry has taken on a whole new meaning for me. One that those fighting for my rights had no doubt been thinking about all along. It\u2019s not about the right to get married. It\u2019s not even really about the right to get divorced. It\u2019s about the right. The human right to be treated the same as anyone else. The right to have the option.

      "bodyText": "Caps on aircraft movements and flight curfews are restricting the efficiency of Sydney airport, according to the Productivity Commission. A draft report on the economic regulation of airports says these can exacerbate delays, cause congestion and force aircraft to either wait on the ground or in holding patterns in the air. The report stops short of recommending removing the curfew that applies between 11pm and 6am \u2013 an option that would be politically contentious in some marginal electorates. But it suggests changes could be made to the system that now restricts aircraft movements to 80 an hour, measured over a rolling hour every 15 minutes. Instead, the commission suggests that either spreading the movement cap over a longer time period than what is now measured, or removing the cap on actual movements but maintaining one on scheduled movements, which \u201ccould improve the efficiency of the movement cap without leading to a net increase in noise\u201d. It also suggests the adoption of noise-based criteria to determine which aircraft can operate during the curfew period, rather than the current system that makes exemptions based on a prescribed list of aircraft types. The report says the commission \u201csupports the plans for western Sydney airport to operate without a curfew\u201d. It said Sydney airport\u2019s movement cap, while aimed at restricting noise, could sometimes result in more noise and emissions if planes were \u201cforced to wait in the air rather than land to avoid breaching the movement cap or curfew, creating additional noise, excess environmental emissions and unnecessary fuel burn\u201d. The draft report still finds that Sydney airport is operating efficiently. It also finds that the country\u2019s main airports \u2013 Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth \u2013 have not exercised their market power to the detriment of the community. While many consumers resent the cost of parking at airports, the commission says, high car parking fees were not an example of airports abusing their market power. \u201cThe price of parking at-terminal can largely be explained by the value passengers place on convenience, the limited amount of land close to the terminal, and the need to manage congestion,\u201d the report says.",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has revealed his plan to move forward if his government becomes the first in almost 90 years to lose a legislative vote on the floor of the parliament, and \u201csimply ignore it\u201d. Because he thinks it\u2019s \u201cstupid\u201d legislation. The Morrison government risks a humiliating defeat when parliament resumes next week, with Labor, the Greens and most of the crossbench on track to pass Kerryn Phelp\u2019s medical evacuation bill for refugees and asylum seekers on Manus Island and Nauru. If the Coalition loses the vote, it will be the first time since 1929 a sitting government lost a substantive legislative vote on the floor. When the Stanley Bruce government lost that vote, Bruce called an election the next day. Morrison told Sky News he would not be repeating history. \u201cIf we lose that vote next week, so be it. We won\u2019t be going off to the polls,\u201d he said on Tuesday night. \u201cThe election is in May. I will simply ignore it and we\u2019ll get on with the business. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to be howled down by the Labor party who want to dismantle a border protection system I had a key hand in building.\u201d Morrison was also scathing about the legislation itself. \u201cThis is a stupid bill. It\u2019s written by people who haven\u2019t got the faintest idea how this works,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do and I am so appalled that the Labor party would even play this sort of political game to get a cheap vote in the House next week. \u201cI will stay on the side of strong border protection and he [Bill Shorten] can take a running jump \u2026 We will vote it down, and if that means that the bill goes down, it will be on Bill Shorten\u2019s head. Now Bill Shortens wants [you] to blame the crossbenchers for this, no no, Bill, it\u2019s all on your head.\u201d Morrison told reporters in Melbourne on Wednesday that the bill would also stop the government from rejecting medical transfers to asylum seekers with criminal histories, despite supporters of the bill insisting these protections would remain in place. \u201cThey may be a paedophile, they may be a rapist, they may be a murderer, and this bill will mean that we would just have to take them,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThis is what will happen if Bill Shorten does not put national security ahead of his own political opportunism.\u201d Shorten responded by saying the prime minister should be \u201cashamed of himself\u201d. \u201cThe fact of the matter is people who have done those crimes don\u2019t get the refugee status unless the government\u2019s missed them when they\u2019ve assessed them as refugees,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that somehow because you\u2019re a Liberal you dislike those crimes more than if you\u2019re someone else, I just get sick of that moral superiority and finger pointing.\u201d When defeat became a real threat on the final sitting day last year, Morrison called a snap press conference, where he vowed to \u201cfight them\u201d on this. In an emotional display, he vowed to do \u201ceverything in my power to ensure these changes never see the light of day\u201d. The government, with the help of Cory Bernardi, starved off defeat on the bill last year, by filibustering the bill in the Senate, delaying its return to the House until it was too late to call a vote. But Labor has said it won\u2019t be backing away and, while Cathy McGowan has indicated she will make up her mind when the bill comes before the House, her crossbench colleagues said they had seen no indication the Indi MP was backing away from supporting it. The Phelps bill would see the relevant minister have to justify to the parliament why they have rejected a request for an asylum seeker or refugee to be treated in Australia if two independent doctors judge they need to be moved. An independent health advice panel would review any cases rejected by the minister.

      "bodyText": "Sa\u00efd Benrahma was the standout player as Brentford saw off the challenge of plucky non-League upstarts Barnet. Ed Aarons was there. Ivan Cavaleiro scored the odd goal of five as Wolves finally got the better of Shrewsbury Town. Paul Wilson was there. Ben Fisher braved the rain at Rodney Parade to see Newport book a fifth round tie at home to the Premier League champions. League One strugglers Shrewsbury Town did themselves proud at Molineux, but the class and quality of Wolves saw them through to the fifth round. Matt Doherty scored two and created a third, to earn his side a trip to Bristol City. Barnet\u2019s whiteknuckle FA Cup run is over, while Brentford have earned themselves a trip to play Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium. They\u2019re still playing at Griffin Park and Molineux. Brentford are 3-1 ahead against Barnet, while Wolves are hanging in there against Shrewsbury with three minutes of added time to play. It\u2019s Wolves 3-2 Shrewsbury. More good news from Joe Day: Joe Day, who missed the first game against Boro because his wife was due to give birth to twins, ran straight down the tunnel at the final whistle. While the kids decided to stay put that time, Mrs Day has apparently gone into labour during this game and Joe is rushing off to the hospital to be with her. Here\u2019s hoping he has time to grab a quick shower before he gets to the maternity ward. Steve McClaren\u2019s Championship side saw off League One opposition in Portsmouth courtesy of goals from Nahki Wells and Matt Smith. They will host Watford in the next round. Sensational goals from Robbie Willmott and Padriag Ammond won the replay for Newport, who will entertain Premier League champions Manchester City in the fifth round. Deep into added time at Rodney Parade: Newport\u2019s fans are singing in the rain as their heroes run down the clock out on the quagmire that is the football match. They\u2019ve humbled Middlesbrough tonight and on the touchline, Tony Pulis is looking very displeased indeed. Newport County made the thick end of \u00a31m from their Cup run last season and look set to earn even more tonight. Back at Rodney Parade: Considering the conditions they have had to deal with \u2013 torrential rain and a cut-up morass of a pitch \u2013 Newport\u2019s performance against Middlesbrough tonight has been outstanding. They have bossed a team from two divisions above them for 81 minutes tonight, lead by two goals and could conceivably five or six goals ahead. Their defence has been stout and obdurate, while going forward they have been outstanding. Robbie Willmott has been outstanding, scoring a wonderful solo goal, while getting ball after ball into the penalty area. Up front, Jamille Matt and Padriag AMond have also been excellent. Remember, their reward for winning this game, assuming they hang on, will be a televised home tie against Manchester City. FA Cup latest Brentford 3-1 Barnet Newport County 2-0 Middlesbrough QPR 2-0 Portsmouth Wolves 3-2 Shrewsbury Town Non-league Barnet grab themselves a lifeline at Griffin Park courtesy of David Tutonda. Matt Smith doubles QPR\u2019s lead against Portsmouth, heading home a Luke Freeman free-kick. Brentford increase their lead and all but guarantee themselves a fifth round tie against Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium. Ivan Cavaleiro gives Wolves the lead by the odd goal of five, shooting low past Steve Arnold after being released by Matt Doherty and cutting inside. QPR\u2019s superiority eventually yields dividends as Nahki Wells fires them ahead against Portsmouth. It\u2019s a scruffy goal from a corner, but they all count and he won\u2019t mind. Newport double their lead as they continue to pile the hurt on Middlesbrough. It\u2019s a brilliant goal from a set piece, with Padraig Ammond sprinting from back to a pocket of space at the front stick to turn on a sixpence and volley home the delivery from Robbie Willmott. A trademark Teddy Sheringham move, it was a brilliant delivery and a brilliant finish. There are over 20 minutes left, but Newport already look home and hosed, such has been their dominance. Another substitution for Middlesbrough: Britt Assombalonga is forced off with an injury and is replaced by Ashley Fletcher. Boro have lost both their forwards, which will not help their cause. The still trail by the only goal of the game. Meanwhile at Loftus Road: It remains scoreless between QPR and Portsmouth, but Nahki Wells and Massimo Luongo have both gone close for the home side, who are dominating their opposition from League One. A substitution at Rodney Parade: Middesbrough Jordan Hugill limps off with some manner of injury and is replaced by Rudy Gestede, whose existence, I must confess, I had completely forgotten about. Sorry Rudy. This just in from our man at Griffin Park ... This just in from Wolves v Shrewsbury Town: The half-time proposal takes big stones ... and not just the ones on the engagement ring. Luckily, this chap wasn\u2019t humiliated in front of a full house at Molineux. Newport County take the lead and it\u2019s no more than they deserve after dominating throughout the first half. Robbie Willmott picked up the ball in midfield and bore down on the Middlesbrough penalty area with the defence back-pedalling. Ignoring a run from Padraig Amond, he drops his shoulder and unleashes a shot from the edge of the area. In the Middlesbrough goal, Dimi got a hand to the ball but was unable to keep it out. Newport lead 1-0 at Rodney Parade. Brentford 2-0 Barnet Newport County 0-0 Middlesbrough QPR 0-0 Portsmouth Wolves 2-2 Shrewsbury Town Matt Doherty scores his second of the night, heading Wolves level against Shrewsbury at Molineux. FA Cup half-times Brentford 2-0 Barnet Newport County 0-0 Middlesbrough QPR 0-0 Portsmouth Wolves 1-2 Shrewsbury Town (still playing) League One outfit Shrewsbury have come from behind to take the lead at Molineux. It\u2019s a gaffe from John Ruddy, one of the fringe players brought in by Nuno tonight, that gifts the Shrews the lead. Josh Laurent took a speculative long range shot which the goalkeeper spilled and allowed to trickle over the line. Laurent\u2019s celebrations bordered on the sheepish, but those of the travelling Shrewsbury fans did not. Newport go close again: Robbie Wilmott is sending cross after cross into the Middlesbrough box, wreaking havoc in the process. His latest finds the head of Jamille Matt, who sends a header looping over the bar and onto the roof of the net. It remains 0-0 with four minutes of the half remaining. At Griffin Park, Julian Jeanvier has doubled Brentford\u2019s lead in a match which they\u2019re completely dominating. A Said Benrahma free-kick was curled in from deep and the defender fired home past Mark Cousins. How are Newport not winning? Getting on the end of a cross of a Robbie Willmott cross, Padriag Amond blindsides his marker and sends a bullet header from nine or 10 yards straight at Middlesbrough\u2019s goalkeeper. It was a fairly straightforward save in the end, but Amond really should have scored. Newport are completely bossing this game and should be three or four up by now. Tony Pulis hands a note to Adam Clayton: It seems to be quite a long one, written on a piece of A5 paper. It takes Clayton almost a minute to unfold and read, before he folds it up and tucks it into his sock. I have no idea what it says, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s something along the lines of \u201cYou\u2019re getting hammered by a team from League Two, managed by somebody who went to the same school as me. I was born and reared near here, so if you don\u2019t pull your fingers out, I will be embarrassed and you and your team-mates will be running laps all day tomorrow.\u201d Newport go close again: Jamille Matt leaps to try to get his head on a long ball from deep sent into the Boro penlaty area by Regan Poole. He fails to make contact and the ball drops by the far post, where Joss Labadie is following up, but fails to head home. With a little more savvy, he had a very straightforward tap-in there. There are 28 minutes gone at Rodney Parade and it\u2019s still scoreless, but Newport are on top. QPR 0-0 Portsmouth: QPR are on top at Loftus Road, where both Luke Freeman and Massimo Luongo have both shot wide. Newport County 0-0 Middlesbrough: Padriag Amond brings a smart save out of Boro goalkeeper Dimi, volleying into the Greek\u2019s face and winning a corner from five or six yards. FA Cup latest scores Brentford 1-0 Barnet Newport County 0-0 Middlesbrough QPR 0-0 Portsmouth Wolves 1-1 Shrewsbury Town Shrewsbury equalise at Molineux, recovering from their early setback. Unmarked at a corner, James Bolton buries a powerful header after getting on the end of Oliver Norburn\u2019s corner. Middlesbrough go close: Jordfan Hugill hits the outside of the foot of the left upright with a low drive from distance. There are 17 minutes gone at Rodney Parade, where it remains scoreless and very wet. Back at Rodney Parade: It remains scoreless between Newport County and Boro, but the League Two side have been denied a penalty after Adam Clayton handled in his own penalty area. The Middlesbrough midfielder foolishley and deliberately controlled a ball into the box with his arm, but referee Stuart Attwell somehow missed it. From a subsequent corner, Newport\u2019s Jamille Matt should have scored from a narrow angle, but his shot-cum-cross was stopped by Jass Labadie on the line. At Griffin Park, Brentford have taken the lead against their non-League opponents, with Sergi Canos opening the scoring, converting from close range as a corner came his way. There\u2019s an early goal at Molineux, where Wolves have taken the lead against their League One opponents. Wolves have a corner cleared and Morgan Gibbs-White sends in a cross. The ball breaks for Matt Doherty who makes no mistake. 6 min: Playing in all white, Middlesbrough win a corner when George Friend puts the ball out of play off a Newport defender. The ball\u2019s played to Jonny Howson outside the Newport box and he unleashes a shot from distance. It sails wide, but not by much. Newport 0-0 Middlesbrough: They\u2019ve kicked off at Rodney Parade, where there\u2019s a lot of surface water on a pitch that has hosted over 60 rugby and football matches in the past year. It\u2019s a filthy night in Wales and the pitch is turning into a bog. In the evnt of any of our four Cup matches ending in draws tonight, there\u2019ll be extra time and possibly penalties. Not long now: Our fourth round replays are about to kick off and we\u2019ll be focussing mainly on Newport County v Middlesbrough, while keeping you up to date with the three other matches as they unfold. Weather report: It\u2019s chucking down with rain at Rodney Parade, where little puddles are forming on a very sodden pitch ahead of Newport County\u2019s match against Middlesbrough. I fancy the Welsh outfit to cause an upset here tonight. Newport County: Day, Butler, Demetriou, O\u2019Brien, Bennett, Poole, Bakinson, Labadie, Willmott, Matt, Amond. Subs: Townsend, Pipe, Forbes, Sheehan, Crofts, Dolan, Marsh-Brown. Middlesbrough: Dimi, McNair, Fry, Ayala, Flint, Friend, Clayton, Wing, Howson, Assombalonga, Hugill Subs: Lonergan, Besic, Downing, Tavernier, Van la Parra, Fletcher, Gestede QPR: Lumley, Furlong, Hall, Lynch, Bidwell, Freeman, Luongo, Scowen, Osayi-Samuel, Smith, Wells. Subs: Ingram, Kakay, Leistner, Manning, Wszolek, Eze, Hemed. Portsmouth: Macgillivray, Walkes, Burgess, Clarke, Brown, Naylor, May, Lowe, Close, Dennis, Hawkins. Subs: Bass, Haunstrup, Thompson, Evans, Morris, Pitman. Wolves: Ruddy, Doherty, Bennett, Coady, Boly, Jonny, Gibbs-White, Saiss, Cavaleiro, Costa, Traore. Subs: Norris, Neves, Jimenez, Giles, Moutinho, Dendoncker, Ennis. Shrewsbury Town: Arnold, Haynes, Beckles, Docherty, Okenabirhie, Bolton, Vincelot, Gilliead, Waterfall, Laurent, Norburn. Subs: Charles-Cooke, Edwards, Whalley, Amadi-Holloway, Sears, Rowland, Ward. Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo makes six changes for the FA Cup fourth round replay with Shrewsbury. John Ruddy, Morgan GIbbs-White, Romain Saiss, Ivan Cavaleiro, Adama Traore and Helder Costa all start at Molineux. Former Wolves midfielder Dave Edwards has overcome a groin injury to make the bench for the Sky Bet League One visitors. Brentford: Daniels, Jeanvier, Sorensen, Dalsgaard, Odubajo, Sawyers, McEachran, Konsa, Canos, Maupay, Benrahma. Subs: Bentley, Watkins, Mokotjo, Da Silva, Ogbene, Barbet, Forss. Barnet: Cousins, Alexander, Sweeney, Johnson, Tutonda, Taylor, Robson, Fonguck, Mason-Clark, Coulthirst, Elito. Subs: Harrison, Sparkes, Matrevics, Akinola, Boucaud, Payne, Bettamer. Referee: Roger East (Wiltshire) Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo may field a few fringe players against tonight\u2019s League One opposition, in a move that could open him to criticism is his Premier League outfit gets beaten. With Wolves\u2019 Premier League status already secure and a fifth round tie against Bristol City awaiting the winners of tonight\u2019s match, the Midlands club have a glorious chance to win the FA Cup for the first time since 1960. Diogo Jota will definitely miss out after picking up a knock against Everton at the weekend, while Ruben Vinagre is also out with illness. Ruben Neves faces a late fitness test and may start on the bench, if at all. \u201cThey will come here, and for them it is a cup final,\u201d said Nuno. \u201cSo we expect a very tough game against a highly motivated team. We have to match them in that regard. I know it\u2019s going to almost be a full house, I\u2019m really glad for it because we\u2019re going to need their support.\u201d For the Shrews, Mat Sadler and Anthony Grant must sit this one out on the naughty step, while manager Sam Ricketts is cautiously optimistic Dave Edwards can return from injury to play some part in proceedings. Tomer Hemed has recovered from a hernia operation and may make tonight\u2019s match squad. Steve McClaren will have to make do without Angel Rangel and on-loan Geoff Cameron, who are both injured. \u201cI like the buzz that has been created and that is why I put great significance on the first game,\u201d said McClaren. \u201cWe had to get a result and make sure we got in the hat. We did that and that has given the winners Watford at home which is an extra incentive to play for. We\u2019ve none more so than to win. We want to go through in the Cup. As much for the supporters than anything, it\u2019s going to be a great atmosphere with plenty of fans.\u201d Portsmouth manager Kenny Jackett will be without the four signings he made last week, as none of the players concerned were at the club for the drawn game at Fratton Park. Dion Donohue is also out, while defender Jack Whatmough is a doubt. Joe Daly is back between the sticks for Newport, having missed the original match to be with his wife who was due to give birth to twins. Middlesbrough boss Tony Pulis is liklely to make changes to the side that beat West Brom by the odd goal of five on Saturday, as they line up for their fourth game in 12 days. \u201cI am not thinking about Man City one bit, not a chance,\u201d said Newport manager Michael Flynn. \u201cThis could end up like Bullseye - Bully\u2019s special prize, look what you could have won. You start getting carried away and you see the boat floating off, and you end up with a rubber dinghy. I have too much respect for Tony Pulis, too much respect for Middlesbrough Football Club, and that is all I\u2019m thinking about.\u201d We believe him, although thousands wouldn\u2019t. Brentford full-back Rico Henry has been ruled out of tonight\u2019s game after picking up an injury in his team\u2019s win over Blackburn on Saturday, while midfielders Lewis Macleod and Emiliano Marcondes are also out. Barnet have no such injury concerns going into this game, but their chairman Tony Kleanthous has announced that he and other Barnet officials will not be attending tonight\u2019s match as a protest over the allocation of tickets at Griffin Park. Brentford\u2019s ground has a capacity of 12,763 and Kleanthous is upset that Barnet have been allocated less than the maximum away allocation of 15%, which is 1,914. Brentford have cited health and safety reasons for only distributing 1,600 tickets to Barnet because the section reserved for visiting fans only hands a little over that number. As a consequence of all this, officials of Barnet FC have decided to give their boardroom tickets to the players\u2019 families and not to attend the boardroom of Brentford FC,\u201d said Kleanthous in a statement. \u201cThis is in order to show solidarity with our fans who will now miss out on this very special occasion.\u201d We have four FA Cup fourth round replays to keep tabs on tonight, all between teams from different divisions. Following their thriller at The Hive, Brentford and Barnet will resume battle at Griffin Park, where the only non-League side left in this year\u2019s competition hope to secure a fifth round home tie against Swansea. Meanwhile in Wales, a home tie against Manchester City is the reward for whoever prevails at Rodney Parade between League Two side Newport County and their Championship opponents Middlesbrough. At Loftus Road, Championship side QPR will be hoping to end a poor recent run of form when they entertain Portsmouth from the top end of the division below. And finally, at Molineux, Wolves take on Shrewsbury Town from League One, with a home tie against Watford in the next round up for grabs. All four games start at 7.45pm (GMT) and we\u2019ll provide news of all the goals as they go in, as well as other talking points. In the meantime, stay tuned for team news and build-up as we countdown to kick-off.",

      "body": "<p>Barnet\u2019s chairman, Tony Kleanthous, had promised a party whatever the result and while their escapades are over following a bad-tempered encounter in west London, Darren Currie will certainly always remember this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/28/barnet-brentford-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report\" title=\"\">unlikeliest of FA Cup</a> runs.</p> <p>In the end, the Barnet manager\u2019s team, the lowest-ranked left in the competition, succumbed to the quality of Sa\u00efd Benrahma as the playmaker helped Brentford book a trip to Swansea for the fifth round with assists for the opening two goals in the first half. But having seen his players progress all the way from beating their fellow National League side Braintree Town in the fourth qualifying round back in October to beating Sheffield United in round three, Currie could still afford to smile at the final whistle after a spirited performance from his team that could easily have yielded another shock.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/05/newport-county-middlesbrough-fa-cup-fourth-round-replay-match-report\">Newport sink Middlesbrough to earn dream reward with Manchester City</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey\u2019re disappointed but when we look at it in a few days they will realise what they have achieved,\u201d said the former midfielder. \u201cIf we had got our goal at 2-0 it could have been a different story. But I\u2019m immensely proud of how they performed.\u201d</p> <p>After a brilliant free kick from Dan Sparkes had forced a replay in front of a record crowd at the Hive two weekends ago, Barnet were attempting to go further in this competition than they have ever been against a side who are more than 70 places above them in the league pyramid.</p> <p>In protest against Brentford\u2019s decision to only allow 1,600 visiting supporters \u2013 300 fewer than the maximum permitted \u2013 Kleanthous watched the game in the club bar nine miles away because he \u201cdidn\u2019t feel comfortable sitting with the prawn sandwich brigade\u201d when so many fans had missed out on such an important occasion.</p> <p>With swathes of red seats in the main stand remaining unoccupied as the match kicked off, it seemed a shame a compromise couldn\u2019t have been reached by two sides who also share a nickname.

      "bodyText": "Barnet\u2019s chairman, Tony Kleanthous, had promised a party whatever the result and while their escapades are over following a bad-tempered encounter in west London, Darren Currie will certainly always remember this unlikeliest of FA Cup runs. In the end, the Barnet manager\u2019s team, the lowest-ranked left in the competition, succumbed to the quality of Sa\u00efd Benrahma as the playmaker helped Brentford book a trip to Swansea for the fifth round with assists for the opening two goals in the first half. But having seen his players progress all the way from beating their fellow National League side Braintree Town in the fourth qualifying round back in October to beating Sheffield United in round three, Currie could still afford to smile at the final whistle after a spirited performance from his team that could easily have yielded another shock. \u201cThey\u2019re disappointed but when we look at it in a few days they will realise what they have achieved,\u201d said the former midfielder. \u201cIf we had got our goal at 2-0 it could have been a different story. But I\u2019m immensely proud of how they performed.\u201d After a brilliant free kick from Dan Sparkes had forced a replay in front of a record crowd at the Hive two weekends ago, Barnet were attempting to go further in this competition than they have ever been against a side who are more than 70 places above them in the league pyramid. In protest against Brentford\u2019s decision to only allow 1,600 visiting supporters \u2013 300 fewer than the maximum permitted \u2013 Kleanthous watched the game in the club bar nine miles away because he \u201cdidn\u2019t feel comfortable sitting with the prawn sandwich brigade\u201d when so many fans had missed out on such an important occasion. With swathes of red seats in the main stand remaining unoccupied as the match kicked off, it seemed a shame a compromise couldn\u2019t have been reached by two sides who also share a nickname. Yet the group of supporters stationed behind Barnet\u2019s goalkeeper, Mark Cousins, for the first half more than made up for it in terms of atmosphere. Even the opening goal after seven minutes from Sergi Can\u00f3s didn\u2019t seem to dampen their enthusiasm, with the Spaniard confidently tucking home Benrahma\u2019s cutback following an innovative corner routine for his third goal in as many matches. Brentford have been revitalised in recent weeks under the head coach Thomas Franks, having not lost in 10 matches since mid-December \u2013 a run that has lifted them well away from the bottom three in the Championship. A talented side packed with players who are comfortable on the ball, they will move to a new 17,250-capacity stadium up the road at the end of next season and could be real contenders to reach the top flight for the first time since before the second world war if they continue their upward trajectory. The only issue for their chairman Matthew Benham will be retaining his best players, with Chris Mepham having become the latest to leave last month for Bournemouth. Neal Maupay \u2013 the former France Under-21 who ended up in west London after a spell at Saint-Etienne \u2013 could be the next to fly the nest, while Algeria international Benrahma, a fellow graduate from Nice\u2019s academy, also looks good enough to play at a higher level. His pinpoint delivery from a free-kick allowed Julian Jeanvier to volley home the second and it suddenly felt a long way back for Currie\u2019s team. But if Brentford thought their opponents would simply roll over in the second half, they were mistaken. Within two minutes of the restart, a near 22-man brawl ensued that threatened to spill into the stands after Barnet\u2019s Medy Elito slid in recklessly on Can\u00f3s before falling to the ground when his opponent squared up to him. Both escaped with bookings but the bad feeling lingered throughout the second half. Sparkes came off the bench to curl a free kick just over from almost the same position as his equaliser in the first match before Craig Robson\u2019s header struck the woodwork from a free-kick. Another flowing move eventually saw Maupay score his 20th goal of the season to put the tie beyond Barnet before David Tutonda\u2019s consolation ensured their supporters could make the short journey home with their heads held high. \u201cIt\u2019s 30 years since we have been in a quarter-final so it would be nice to do that again,\u201d said Franks. Playing like this, Brentford will be a match for anyone. QPR ease past Pompey Second-half goals from Nahki Wells and Matt Smith proved the difference as QPR made it through to the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time in 22 years with a 2-0 win at the expense of Portsmouth at Loftus Road. In a quiet first period, Darnell Furlong\u2019s header against the bar from Luke Freeman\u2019s centre was the pick of the chances. Extra time looked a distinct possibility heading into the break, but Wells, QPR\u2019s top-scorer, broke the deadlock with 20 minutes left, capitalising on chaos at a corner to bundle in from a yard out. The result was then made safe seven minutes later as the talismanic Freeman delivered a sumptuous free-kick which Smith powered home to set up a home tie against Watford on 15 February.",

      "bodyText": "The Australian government has renewed demands for the release of Hakeem al-Araibi after the Thai prosecutor publicly confirmed the government has the power to set him free, regardless of the extradition process. On Monday the 25-year-old footballer from Melbourne, a Bahraini refugee, was remanded in prison for another two months after the Ratchadaphisek criminal court gave him 60 days to prepare a defence to Bahrain\u2019s extradition request. Speaking after the hearing, the Thai prosecutor confirmed that the country\u2019s attorney general has powers of executive discretion and could return Al-Araibi to Australia at any point. Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said the Australian government remained \u201cdeeply concerned by his ongoing detention\u201d and continued to advocate \u201cat the highest levels\u201d in Thailand and Bahrain. \u201cThe Australian government reiterates its calls for the Thai government to release Hakeem al-Araibi home to Australia to be with his friends and family following his extradition hearing,\u201d Payne said. \u201cBoth governments are aware of the importance of this matter to the Australian government and Australian people.\u201d At Monday\u2019s court hearing Al-Araibi was brought to the court barefoot, in prison clothes, with his legs shackled. As he walked past media and supporters he shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t send me to Bahrain.\u201d On Tuesday evening the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said seeing Al-Araibi in shackles had prompted him to write to Thai prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, a second time, after first writing last week to call for Al-Araibi to be sent back to Australia. \u201cI\u2019ve written to him again, because I was very disturbed at the appearance of Hakeem at the hearing the other day,\u201d Morrison told Sky News. \u201cHe was shackled and I thought that was very upsetting and I know it would have upset many Australians. \u201cI\u2019m respectfully reminding the Thai prime minister that Australians feel very strongly about this, very very strongly.\u201d The images, which were broadcast internationally, have also upset Thai people. Thai media is not permitted to show prisoners in restraints and local outlets including the Bangkok Post airbrushed the shackles out of pictures. \u201cI think this is causing an outrage because a lot of international media are on this story and Thai people don\u2019t want to see Thailand treating prisoners like this,\u201d a senior Thai journalist said. The corrections department\u2019s director general, Police Colonel Narat Sawatanan, said the restraints were not \u201cshackles\u201d because they could be locked and unlocked, and defended the decision to use them on Al-Araibi by saying there was a lot of public interest in the case. \u201cIt is our duty to transport prisoners to prevent them from fleeing,\u201d he said. Al-Araibi fears he will be imprisoned and tortured \u2013 as he alleges occurred in 2012 \u2013 if he is returned. The Bahraini government bases its extradition request on an act of vandalism which occurred when, or very shortly after, he was playing in a televised football match, but Al-Araibi believes it is attempted political retribution. \u201cThe Thai government should see that Bahrain\u2019s sole motive is to further punish Hakeem for the peaceful political opinions he expressed,\u201d said an Amnesty International Thailand campaigner, Katherine Gerson. Supporters of Al-Araibi have stepped up calls for sanctions and boycotts \u2013 primarily imposed by world sporting bodies such as Fifa and the International Olympic Committee \u2013 against Bahrain and Thailand. \u201cYou cannot have the privileges of the international community if you are not prepared to live by its rules or behave by its standards,\u201d said the head of Professional Footballers Australia, John Didulica. Allan McKinnon, Australia\u2019s ambassador-designate, would not be drawn on whether Australia was considering sanctions against Thailand if it failed to act. \u201cWhat we are considering at the moment is anything we can do to more rapidly move Hakeem al-Araibi out of detention, have this case finished and allow him to go back to Australia,\u201d McKinnon said outside the court. He said Australia and the other 14 countries represented in court to support Al-Araibi would \u201ccontinue to press\u201d. Pressure on Thailand is increasing, and its head of immigration, Surachate Hakparn, personally responded to criticism of Al-Araibi\u2019s shackles and bare feet at court on Monday. Hakparn replied to numerous tweets to say it was in line with international standards \u2013 something disputed by human rights groups. On Tuesday morning Hakparn tweeted a screenshot of McKinnon\u2019s statement, posted by the Australian embassy in Thailand. He added the words: \u201cWe hope that Hakeem will be able to go back to be with his family and his wife in the coming days.\u201d The posted comment, on behalf of McKinnon, said the actions of Bahrain had put Thailand \u201cin a very difficult position\u201d. \u201cThe government of Bahrain knew very well that Hakeem al-Araibi lived in Australia since 2014. During these four years, the Bahraini government did not attempt to ask Australia about Hakeem at all or to request to send him back to Bahrain.\u201d The role of Australian authorities in Al-Araibi\u2019s arrest has become a key question, and supporters have said that while they are now concentrating on getting him released, they would seek accountability when the ordeal was over. He was arrested in November on an Interpol red notice, issued against Interpol\u2019s refugee protection policies. Australian federal police, working as locally based Interpol, notified Thailand of his arrival \u2013 a process that is understood to be largely automatic when someone subject to a red notice is travelling \u2013 and did not flag his refugee status. Al-Araibi has said he asked Australian government officials if he was safe to travel and was told he would be. Speaking to 2GB radio at the weekend, Morrison suggested Al-Araibi bore some responsibility. \u201cIf you have a permanent protection visa and you live in Australia, please don\u2019t go to countries where you can put yourself at risk in these situations,\u201d he said. Asked by the host, Alan Jones, about Australian officials \u201ctipping off\u201d Thai authorities, Morrison said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re focused on is getting him home.\u201d While Payne and diplomatic staff have lobbied on behalf of Al-Araibi since his arrest, Morrison personally intervened only last week, speaking to the Thai ambassador and writing to the Thai prime minister. He told 2GB he was yet to receive a reply.",

      "bodyText": "The \u201cseeds of disaster\u201d were sown at Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s Hillsborough football ground 10 years before 96 people were killed at a 1989 FA Cup semi-final, a court has been told. John Cutlack, a structural engineer with 40 years\u2019 experience of working on sports grounds, said the most significant error made by the club\u2019s engineers, Eastwood &amp; Partners, was \u201ca gross over-estimate\u201d of the safe capacity on the Leppings Lane terrace. The figure of 7,200, which was sanctioned and stated on the club\u2019s safety certificate in 1979, and never amended throughout the decade before lethal overcrowding caused the deaths on that terrace, was 1,774 more than the total safe capacity calculated by Cutlack, of 5,426. He agreed with Jason Beer QC, representing Graham Mackrell, Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s club secretary and safety officer at the time of the disaster, that the over-calculation was a \u201creally big error\u201d by the firm, which was headed by a distinguished engineer, Dr Wilfred Eastwood. \u201cThe seeds of the disaster were sown by Dr Eastwood\u2019s calculations here,\u201d Beer said. \u201cIn short it was the firm that sowed that seed, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Cutlack replied. Eastwood\u2019s failing, which undermined the safety of the Leppings Lane end where the lethal crush happened in 1989, was \u201cremarkable\u201d and \u201cfundamental\u201d, Cutlack said. It was compounded by other failings, including having insufficient turnstiles at that end, and flaws in the crush barrier system, he said. Mackrell is charged with two criminal offences relating to his duties as the club\u2019s safety officer for the 1989 semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, including an alleged failure to agree with police a change to the turnstile arrangements from those for the semi-final between the same two clubs the previous year. The second charge is that he breached the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 by failing to ensure the number of turnstiles was sufficient to prevent unduly large crowds building up, and failing to draw up contingency plans to cope if that did happen. David Duckenfield, the South Yorkshire police chief superintendent who commanded the 1989 FA Cup match, is standing trial, alongside Mackrell at Preston crown court, charged with gross negligence manslaughter in relation to the deaths. Cutlack agreed with Ben Myers QC, representing Duckenfield, that the availability of only seven turnstiles for 10,100 people with standing tickets to support Liverpool at the Leppings Lane end was \u201can insufficient number to prevent a build up of a crowd outside the ground\u201d. At the 1988 semi-final, he confirmed, 13 turnstiles were used, for those 10,100, and 4,465 people with tickets for the West Stand seats above the terrace. Cutlack also agreed that several elements at the Leppings Lane end were below standard: \u2022 Signs above the turnstiles were \u201cconfusing\u201d for supporters and did not correspond to the layout depicted on their tickets. \u2022 The tunnel leading to \u201cpens\u201d 3 and 4 of the terrace \u201cshould have been manned to ensure overcrowding did not occur\u201d. \u2022 Its downward slope was \u201cirregular and in places it was too steep\u201d. \u2022 Spans in two crush barriers should not have been removed, because that increased the downward pressure of a crowd surge. \u2022 Four of the crush barriers were \u201csignificantly\u201d lower than the recommended heights in the official \u201cgreen guide\u201d to safety at sports grounds, which also increased the downward pressure, and three were too high. \u2022 The gates in the high metal fence at the front of the terrace, which opened on to the pitch perimeter, were 30% narrower than the green guide recommended width, so did not allow proper emergency access, and the steps up to the gates within the terrace were \u201cirregular\u201d and too high. Cutlack said Eastwood\u2019s initial failing, overcalculating the terrace capacity, was followed by failures to review and amend the capacity when the terrace was divided into the pens in 1981, then further divided in 1985, and when the crush barrier spans were removed in 1986. The judge, Sir Peter Openshaw, gave legal guidance to the jury of six men and six women, reminding them that Mackrell is charged with \u201cvery specific and narrow offences\u201d. He told them: \u201cThose charges do not concern the broader matters relevant to safety at Hillsborough, nor the criticism of the club more generally.\u201d Both Mackrell and Duckenfield have pleaded not guilty to the charges. The trial continues.",

The figures, shown to the Guardian by a senior party insider, suggest net membership has declined by around 6,000 in each of the past two months, from 524,000 at the start of December, to 512,000. That number would still make Labour by far the biggest political party in Britain \u2013 approximately four times the size of the Conservatives, whose membership was estimated at 124,000 last spring. A party spokesman said: \u201cLabour is one of the largest political parties in Europe, made up of over half a million members, who are working to transform our society for the many not the few.\u201d Turning Labour into a mass \u201csocial movement\u201d, that is involved in community activism year-round as well as knocking on doors during election campaigns, is a central part of Corbyn\u2019s project to transform his party. Labour has vehemently denied a series of news stories in recent days, suggesting the party could face financial difficulties as a result of a drop-off in paying members. Party insiders insist the overwhelming majority of the 6,000-a-month membership decline is accounted for by \u201clapsers\u201d: members whose payments have been in arrears for six months. These show up 18 months after they first signed up for a year-long membership. Surges in membership followed Corbyn\u2019s election as leader in 2015 \u2013 under new rules that allowed \u00a33-a-head \u201csupporters\u201d to vote, many of whom subsequently joined up \u2013 and his re-election in 2016, party sources suggest. Another peak came in summer of 2017, when a crowd of tens of thousands at Glastonbury chanted \u201coh, Jeremy Corbyn!\u201d \u2013 and the Guardian understands the 575,000 figure was reported to Labour\u2019s national executive committee at that time. Setting lapsers aside, more members have joined Labour than resigned during recent weeks. But several MPs claim scores of local activists have become disillusioned and drifted away, as a result of what they regard as the party\u2019s ambivalent stance on Brexit. The leadership has resisted fierce pressure from grassroots members, who are overwhelmingly pro-remain, to swing its weight behind a second referendum \u2013 instead merely suggesting MPs should be given the option of considering a \u201cpublic vote\u201d to resolve the impasse at Westminster. Anti-Brexit members were given fresh cause for alarm about Corbyn\u2019s Eurosceptic instincts on Tuesday when a video emerged from 2009 of him referring to the EU as a \u201cmilitary frankesnstein\u201d, which would cement the control of Nato. Like his mentor Tony Benn, Corbyn was resolutely anti-EU throughout his time as a backbencher; but he backed remain during the 2016 referendum campaign, in part because of the stance of the party\u2019s members. Concerns about Labour\u2019s record in tackling antisemitism are also cited by some MPs as a reason for disillusionment among grassroots members. The parliamentary Labour party (PLP) passed a motion on Monday night calling on the leadership \u201cto adequately tackle cases of antisemitism, as failure to do so seriously risks antisemitism in the party appearing normalised and the party seeming to be institutionally antisemitic\u201d. Corbyn apologised 10 months ago for the \u201churt and pain\u201d caused by instances of antisemitism within Labour and pledged to redouble his \u201cefforts to bring this anxiety to an end\u201d. With Corbyn loyalists now in the majority on the NEC, a series of radical changes to party rules were introduced at last year\u2019s party conference in Liverpool, which are only now starting to work their way through the sprawling organisation. These included a lowering of the threshold for launching an all-member \u201ctrigger ballot\u201d against a sitting MP; and an option for local parties to vote to change their democratic structure to all-member voting.",

      "bodyText": "Government pledges of \u00a380m in support to Nissan were part of a package of almost \u00a3150m in state aid promised to leading carmakers since the EU referendum in 2016, as ministers tried to prevent an exodus of jobs from the UK. Support offered since October that year has totalled at least \u00a364.1m, according to Guardian analysis of EU data on state aid. The business secretary, Greg Clark, was on Monday forced to admit that Nissan had been offered \u00a384.2m since 2016 after he previously refused to disclose what support had been offered. Clark also wrote to the Japanese company saying it would not be \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the UK leaving the EU. After lobbying from Theresa May and written promises of financial support, Nissan announced in October 2016 that it would build its new Qashqai and X-Trail models in Sunderland. But at the weekend the company revealed that it would not build the new X-Trail in Sunderland, citing a decline in sales of diesel cars across Europe as well as Brexit uncertainty. Nissan will have to reapply for at least some of the aid package, which was later reduced to \u00a361m, after reneging on part of its original commitment. Toyota has been promised \u00a321.1m by the government, while Ford has been offered \u00a314.6m. BMW, which owns the Mini brand, has received pledges totalling of at least \u00a36.3m, of which between \u00a3440,000 and \u00a3880,000) was tax relief offered to its UK manufacturing arm. Some of the support has not yet been paid to the companies. Clark credited the state aid with keeping jobs in the UK which might otherwise have moved abroad. Toyota said in March 2017 it would invest \u00a3240m in its plant in Burnaston, Derbyshire, after the government pledge. During the same month Vauxhall reiterated existing production commitments at its Luton and Ellesmere Port sites, after its owner, PSA Group, received promises of support. The company has not yet received any payments. Jaguar Land Rover, the largest UK car manufacturer, received pledges of \u00a36m. Aston Martin Lagonda received pledges of \u00a37m, while McLaren received \u00a39m. The state aid will be paid via a variety of avenues, including through the \u00a32.6bn Regional Growth Fund and Innovate UK, a non-departmental government body. Some of the aid was delivered via climate change agreements, in which companies receive tax breaks in exchange for lowering their emissions. Labour said it was pressing Clark for answers to a string of questions relating to the Nissan deal, including whether the company would still receive the grants despite having to reapply and whether any conditions were attached. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, has also asked whether UK car makers will retain tariff-free access to the EU after Brexit. Clark will also face questions from the business select committee on Wednesday morning. The minister is under pressure after keeping secret from MPs that he was in discussions with Nissan about a package of subsidies, even though he had insisted in an appearance on Question Time in October 2016 there was \u201cno chequebook\u201d on offer to the car maker. Clark had refused to release a four-page letter that set out the government\u2019s reassurances and financial offer, only relenting after Nissan revealed it had change its decision on the new X-Trail. The UK car industry is often cited as one of the country\u2019s manufacturing and exporting success stories, with \u00a382bn in turnover in 2017, according the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, an industry body. The sector supports the jobs of 856,000 people across the UK. Carmakers across the world have been cutting back spending in recent months amid falling demand fin China, one of the largest markets, and increased regulatory scrutiny on diesel cars after Volkswagen\u2019s emissions scandal. Some of the same companies which have received British state aid pledges have since announced job cuts in the UK, citing falling demand.",

The research found even the Journal of American Transplantation and the official journal of the The Transplantation Society, which have policies barring unethical research involving executed prisoners, had published questionable papers. The paper concludes: \u201cThe transplant community has failed to implement ethical standards banning publication of research using material from executed prisoners.\u201d World Pope Francis has for the first time publicly acknowledged the scandal of priests and bishops sexually abusing nuns, and says he is committed to doing more to fight the problem. Theresa May has said she will not allow changes to the Brexit withdrawal agreement that give no insurance for the people of Northern Ireland, suggesting she would reject any proposal that disrupted border communities. Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has issued a thinly veiled threat to the young opposition leader trying to force him from power, hinting that Juan Guaid\u00f3 could soon be imprisoned as a result of his challenge. Police have arrested a woman on suspicion of starting a fire that swept through an eight-storey apartment building in Paris, killing at least 10 people and injuring 30 others, including eight firefighters. Nasa scientists have landed for the first time on one of the world\u2019s newest islands, and discovered the three-year-old land mass is now covered in a sticky, mysterious mud, as well as vegetation and bird life. Opinion and analysis At the World Economic Forum last week, the emerging relationship between the Davos set and far-right populists was plain to see. And it is far rosier than either party would like to admit, writes Cas Mudde. \u201cNeoliberal elites from Davos to Seattle do not oppose the rightwing populist agenda. They are trying to shape the post-Trump world, in which big business can amass profits unopposed by largely privatised and underfunded states.\u201d When asked to provide evidence that closing tax loopholes would weaken the economy, Scott Morrison said: \u201cI think it\u2019s just fundamental economics 101.\u201d Richard Denniss writes that in 25 years of teaching, he has never read such a statement in any economics textbook. \u201cOn the contrary, economics 101 makes it clear that collecting more revenue from something that causes harm (like coal) and spending that money on something that causes good (like education) will simultaneously help the economy, help the environment and make people happier. It\u2019s a win-win-win.\u201d Sport From far away has come the news of England\u2019s worst cricketing week since the last Ashes. Meanwhile, Australia\u2019s cricket team, badly battered in 2018 by both scandal and failure, is showing faint, though only faint, signs of recovery. This summer\u2019s Ashes could be thrillingly close, writes Matthew Engel. Australians will be forced to rethink weekend summer sports in the near future, according to a new report by the Climate Council, that shows more extreme weather happening more often across Australia. Thinking time: the rise and rise of New York\u2019s pencil towers It is rare in the history of architecture for a new type of building to emerge. The Romans\u2019 discovery of concrete birthed the great domes and fortifications of its empire. The Victorians\u2019 development of steel led to an era of majestic bridges and vaulted train sheds. The US invention of the elevator created the first skyscrapers in Chicago. Now, we are seeing a new type of structure that perfectly embodies the 21st-century age of technical ingenuity and extreme inequality. A heady confluence of engineering prowess, zoning loopholes and an unparalleled concentration of personal wealth have together spawned a new species of super-tall, super-skinny, super-expensive spires. Any visitor to New York over the past few years will have witnessed this curious new breed of pencil-thin tower. Poking up above the Manhattan skyline like etiolated beanpoles, they seem to defy the laws of both gravity and commercial sense. They stand like naked elevator shafts awaiting their floors, raw extrusions of capital piled up until it hits the clouds. Media roundup The Daily Telegraph\u2019s front page is dedicated to a story headlined Sick Joke, about what it describes as \u201cboat people [making] a mockery of of medical transfers\u201d, in a story revealing that 900 people medically transferred to Australia from Manus Island and Nauru have not returned to offshore processing centres. Bank stocks soared to give the sharemarket its biggest one-day rise in two years, the Australian reports, with $19bn added to the sector. Adelaide house prices have climbed 2.13% in the December quarter, and 4.01% on the same period in 2017, the Advertiser reveals, approaching a record median price of $500,000. Coming up Donald Trump will deliver the delayed annual State of the Union address to the US Congress. It is expected to start at 1pm AEDT. The Commonwealth Bank will release its half-year results, becoming the first bank to do so after the final report of the banking royal commission.

And so, in a way, will be the reputations of the organisations he worked for. For Freeman\u2019s case, brought by the General Medical Council, centres on claims he ordered banned testosterone for an unnamed rider in 2011 \u2013 and then tried to cover his tracks. The 57-year-old, who denies any wrongdoing, is also alleged to have lied to the UK Anti-Doping Agency, provided inappropriate treatment to non-riding staff and kept haphazard records. Freeman worked for Team Sky and British Cycling between 2009 and 2017. The stakes are high and, with several former members of Team Sky and British Cycling expected to give evidence, there is hope some light will be shone on one of the more curious incidents in British sport in recent years. What is Freeman accused of doing? Freeman is alleged to have ordered 30 sachets of Testogel, which is on the World Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s prohibited list, in May 2011 to be sent to the Manchester velodrome to \u201cadminister to an athlete to improve their athletic performance\u201d \u2013 and then lied about it.

What is on the line? If the charges against Freeman are upheld he is likely to be struck off.

King, the proxy for Trump, was not so much interested in the answer. Trump is set on the border being the issue heading right up to the next election. The shutdown was his opening salvo for the entire campaign. Iowa will play a role in moderating that schism, looking for that candidate with an iron fist inside a velvet glove.

      "bodyText": "Ireland is in talks with the EU over a substantial Brexit emergency fund to offset the damage caused to the country\u2019s \u20ac4.5bn (\u00a33.96bn) food exports to Britain if the UK crashes out of the bloc with no deal next month. As Theresa May prepares for a crunch meeting in Brussels on Thursday, officials at the European commission are already looking at continuous compensatory measures for Ireland as part of an ongoing arrangement that could last years. Contingency funds to compensate farmers have already been discussed at the highest levels and are expected to arise in talks with the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, during a round of meetings in Brussels on Wednesday. Sources say Ireland will be looking for a \u201clong-term fix\u201d in EU budget talks in April rather than a lump sum Brexit bailout. Politicians have cited the ongoing assistance given to the Baltic states after Russia banned certain food exports from the EU as an example of financial solidarity it hopes to win in a no-deal Brexit. Ireland exports \u20ac4.5bn worth of food and drink a year to the UK, ranging from beef to cheddar cheese. Calculations by the Department of Agriculture put the cost of tariffs under World Trade Organization rules at \u20ac1.7bn. Michael Creed, Ireland\u2019s minister for agriculture, food and the marine, has said this would be an \u201cexistential challenge\u201d for the food and drink sector. He has previously said Ireland would seek \u201cmega-money\u201d from the EU. The beef industry alone could face increased costs of up to \u20ac700m, which the head of the Irish Farmers Association has said has the potential to wipe out beef production in the country. There are also concerns if Britain flips the other way and adopts a zero-tariffs policy, as this could result in cheaper chicken, beef and lamb from the US and South America displacing both British and Irish cuts from shop shelves. Creed has already talked of the European commission\u2019s \u201creadiness to respond to that crisis should it develop in the context of a crash out\u201d. Informed sources say that ongoing assistance over many years will be the preferred option rather than a lump sum in a Brexit \u201cbailout\u201d. \u201cFlexibility on state aid rules may be one we look for, but any fix is likely to come in the European budget discussions, which start in April, because a no-deal Brexit will have an ongoing impact and will be unpredictable,\u201d said a source referring to the negotiations for the next EU financial cycle of 2020 to 2027. While Brexit is unprecedented, the assistance given to the Baltic states after Russia banned European food exports has been cited as a model for Ireland. Exports from Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia to Russia dropped by \u20ac5.8bn since 2014 and are still being supported by the EU. Creed has said Ireland\u2019s ambition is to \u201cride out the difficulty\u201d and \u201cretain a foothold\u201d in the UK with early engagement with the European commission in terms of \u201cthe need for aid, particularly exceptional aid on the beef side and also exchequer response\u201d. He added that he would also be looking for \u201cflexibility\u201d in state aid rules to allow the Irish government to intervene. Sources in the European commission say they have not come to a view yet but \u201cclearly there will be sympathy and understanding\u201d. A spokesman for the commissioner for agriculture and rural development confirmed they had \u201cexplored the ways in which the EU could help Ireland and Irish businesses\u201d. \u201cThere are possibilities under the Common Market Organisation which, for example, were used in response to the Russian ban and the subsequent dairy crisis. There are also possibilities under state aid rules, which have also been discussed.\u201d Those working on Brexit preparedness at InterTradeIreland, an organisation set up under the Good Friday Agreement to help build cross-border business, say an area of particular concern is the impact a hard Brexit may have on \u201dmicro-businesses\u201d with fewer than 10 people. In Northern Ireland 3,800 micro firms, employing 13,000 people, regularly trade across the border. They have found 7,500 SMEs north of the border and \u201cdouble that\u201d south of the border that trade on both sides. Eight in 10 of micro businesses north of the border export exclusively to Ireland and few have any experience of filling out customs declarations forms or understanding tariff regimes. \u201cThey are the ones most likely to be affected by barriers to market access,\u201d said Kerry Curran, policy research manager, as they are likely to be trading within supply chains and \u201calso have less capacity to absorb the cost\u201d of the extra administrative burden.",

But alcohol campaigners said drinking was still causing problems and demanded action to curb consumption.</p> <p>\u201cIt is worrying that one in five adults are drinking at levels that increase their risk of health problems such as cancer, liver cirrhosis and heart disease. This puts a strain on our NHS and reduces our economic productivity, making us an unhealthy nation all round,\u201d said Katherine Severi, chief executive of the Institute of Alcohol Studies thinktank.</p> <p>NHS Digital\u2019s report, which used 2017 data from England, showed that adults from wealthier backgrounds (27%) were almost twice as likely as those from poorer homes (15%) to drink more than the 14-unit weekly ceiling.</p> <p>\u201cThese data demolish the stereotypes linked to alcohol problems, which aren\u2019t confined to a small minority of so-called irresponsible drinkers. Affluent, well-educated groups are drinking the most.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s vital we move away from such myths. Action on affordability, availability and promotion of alcohol is proven to reduce harm, save lives and bolster public finances,\u201d added Severi.</p> <p>The figures confirm that the proportion of people drinking more than the advised amount, which has been falling for some years, has dropped again. That has fallen by 6% among men and 4% among women since 2011.</p> <p>John Timothy, chief executive of the Portman Group, an alcohol industry lobby group, said: \u201cThese figures once again show that the vast majority of people in England are drinking at or within very low risk levels. This is a positive trend and one that demonstrates increased awareness of the benefits of moderation and responsible drinking.\u201d</p> <p>Those aged 55 to 64 are the likeliest to drink more than 14 units a week, with 36% of men and 20% of women doing that. One in ten (11%) adults drink at least five times a week: 14% of men and 9% of women.</p> <p>Despite the downward trend in drinking, alcohol-related deaths are at their highest since records began in 2001: 5,843 adults in 2017, a 6% rise on the previous year. Four in five had alcoholic liver disease. and others had cancers linked to alcohol consumption, such as cancer of the mouth and liver.</p> <p>The number of people who ended up in hospital due to drink also rose sharply last year, by 100,000 to 1.2 million \u2013 one in every 14 inpatients. The commonest causes of such admissions, in which alcohol was a primary or secondary diagnosis, included cancer, unintentional injuries and heart attacks and strokes. Of those, 83% were over 45 and two-thirds were men.</p> <p>The Royal College of Psychiatrists voiced alarm at another fall in the number of people who were treated as an inpatient for alcohol addiction \u2013 just 76,000 in 2017-18, 6% down year on year.</p> <p>Dr Tony Rao, chair of the college\u2019s addictions faculty, said: \u201cThe \u00a3700m cut from public health budgets since 2014 continues to have a devastating impact on the lives of people struggling with alcohol use disorders.</p> <p>\u201cAlcohol harm to older people remains a growing concern, with baby boomers having the highest rates of alcohol-related deaths and alcohol-related admissions.\u201d</p>",

Far more men (28%) than women (14%) drink more than this threshold, according to NHS Digital, in a detailed portrait of alcohol and the harm it causes. Groups linked to the alcohol industry welcomed the figures showing that fewer people are drinking at risky levels. But alcohol campaigners said drinking was still causing problems and demanded action to curb consumption. \u201cIt is worrying that one in five adults are drinking at levels that increase their risk of health problems such as cancer, liver cirrhosis and heart disease. This puts a strain on our NHS and reduces our economic productivity, making us an unhealthy nation all round,\u201d said Katherine Severi, chief executive of the Institute of Alcohol Studies thinktank. NHS Digital\u2019s report, which used 2017 data from England, showed that adults from wealthier backgrounds (27%) were almost twice as likely as those from poorer homes (15%) to drink more than the 14-unit weekly ceiling. \u201cThese data demolish the stereotypes linked to alcohol problems, which aren\u2019t confined to a small minority of so-called irresponsible drinkers. Affluent, well-educated groups are drinking the most. \u201cIt\u2019s vital we move away from such myths. Action on affordability, availability and promotion of alcohol is proven to reduce harm, save lives and bolster public finances,\u201d added Severi. The figures confirm that the proportion of people drinking more than the advised amount, which has been falling for some years, has dropped again. That has fallen by 6% among men and 4% among women since 2011. John Timothy, chief executive of the Portman Group, an alcohol industry lobby group, said: \u201cThese figures once again show that the vast majority of people in England are drinking at or within very low risk levels. This is a positive trend and one that demonstrates increased awareness of the benefits of moderation and responsible drinking.\u201d Those aged 55 to 64 are the likeliest to drink more than 14 units a week, with 36% of men and 20% of women doing that. One in ten (11%) adults drink at least five times a week: 14% of men and 9% of women. Despite the downward trend in drinking, alcohol-related deaths are at their highest since records began in 2001: 5,843 adults in 2017, a 6% rise on the previous year. Four in five had alcoholic liver disease. and others had cancers linked to alcohol consumption, such as cancer of the mouth and liver. The number of people who ended up in hospital due to drink also rose sharply last year, by 100,000 to 1.2 million \u2013 one in every 14 inpatients. The commonest causes of such admissions, in which alcohol was a primary or secondary diagnosis, included cancer, unintentional injuries and heart attacks and strokes. Of those, 83% were over 45 and two-thirds were men. The Royal College of Psychiatrists voiced alarm at another fall in the number of people who were treated as an inpatient for alcohol addiction \u2013 just 76,000 in 2017-18, 6% down year on year. Dr Tony Rao, chair of the college\u2019s addictions faculty, said: \u201cThe \u00a3700m cut from public health budgets since 2014 continues to have a devastating impact on the lives of people struggling with alcohol use disorders. \u201cAlcohol harm to older people remains a growing concern, with baby boomers having the highest rates of alcohol-related deaths and alcohol-related admissions.\u201d",

Nearly 30 years since her departure from Downing Street, the Lincolnshire town of her birth agreed to honour its most famous daughter with the bronze sculpture, which was originally meant to stand in London\u2019s Parliament Square. The sculpture will be sited on a green in the middle of Grantham after an application was approved on Tuesday by councillors despite warnings from police that it could be \u201ca target for politically-motivated vandals\u201d. The former Conservative prime minister will stand on a green midway between two existing statues, one of the 19th-century MP Frederick James Tollemache and another of Sir Isaac Newton, who went to school in town. In the face of recommendations by police that it be placed on a sufficiently high platform to make it difficult to damage the statue, the 10.5ft statue will stand on a plinth of the same height again. Proposals to erect the \u00a3300,000 bronze sculpture \u2013 which was offered to Grantham last year after original plans for it to be erected in London were rejected \u2013 were approved by local councillors meeting a stone\u2019s throw away from its planned location at a green on St Peter\u2019s Hill. One hope of those behind the plans to bring the Iron Lady \u2013 or at least the bronze one \u2013 to Grantham is that cash tills will rattle to the tune of money spent by visitors ranging from tourists to Thatcherite pilgrims who have long trickled into the market town where she grew up as daughter of a local grocer and mayor. Even here, however, Britain\u2019s first female prime minister continued to polarise opinion during a sometimes stormy meeting of South Kesteven district council\u2019s planning committee. \u201cThis is a statue that no one else wants,\u201d said Ashley Baxter, an independent member who recalled aspects of her legacy ranging from the miners\u2019 strike through to the poll tax. He went on to remind colleagues that a rainbow flag was currently flying outside from council property, something which he said would have been unthinkable during the Thatcher era owing to her government\u2019s support for regulations outlawing public institutions\u2019 \u201cpromotion\u201d of gay relationships. At one point, Baxter asked Graham Jeal, one of the project\u2019s co-ordinators, if consideration had not been given to placing the statue on a revolving platform, adding: \u201cOr is the lady not for turning?\u201d The question was ruled out by the chair for not being sufficiently serious. Nevertheless, Baxter said he saw no reason to oppose the application, which was endorsed by the largely Conservative committee, although not before a Tory member, councillor Rosemary Kaberry-Brown, voiced her regret that it had not been possible to place the statue in the middle of a pond \u201cto stop people climbing up and making a nuisance of themselves\u201d. The local Labour leader, Charmaine Morgan, admitted to being \u201ctorn\u201d about the statue, given the money which visitors to the town would generate.

David Burling noted that he and colleagues had a duty to educate, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t do this by telling an edited story.\u201d He urged people to consider the potential of the statue to generate investment, adding that the museum was in contact with coach trip organisers from all over the world and that visitors frequently ask why there was no statue. The council received 25 letters about the statue \u2013 seven in support, 17 against and one that was categorised as neutral. It is the work of sculptor Douglas Jennings, who depicted Thatcher in the Baronial Gown of Kesteven and wearing the chain of the Order of the Garter. The application was made in the name of Grantham Community Heritage Association (GCHA), which runs the town\u2019s museum. Funding has come from the Public Memorials Appeal, a charity that commissions memorials of historically important people, and from an appeal launched by the Heritage Association. No public funds have been used, according to the council. For now, the statue is at the foundry where it was cast. A council report prepared ahead of Tuesday\u2019s meeting had included a recommendation from Lincolnshire police that it be placed on a sufficiently high plinth to ensure no-one can climb it and that it be subject to CCTV surveillance. \u201cIn general there remains a motivated far-left movement across the UK (though not so much in Lincolnshire) who may be committed to public activism,\u201d said the force. \u201cMargaret Thatcher does however maintain an element of emblematic significance to many on the left and the passage of time does seem to have diminished that intensity of feeling.

That\u2019s rather different from merely tapping a screen, which is the only transaction required to register as a YouTube fan. Moreover, Charles\u2019s narrow celebrity within his own fanbase is hardly comparable to the near-saturation mainstream media coverage attracted by the Fab Four, whose global presence in 60s culture was overwhelming and ubiquitous. My grandmother, who never bought or listened to a popular music recording in her life, couldn\u2019t help but recognise the faces and know the names of all four members of the band.</p> <p>YouTubers such as Charles bear a much greater resemblance to the more ephemeral end of the celebrity spectrum.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a stretch for Amelia Tait to compare YouTube celebrity James Charles to the Beatles (Opinion, 30 January). Buying a Beatles single \u2013 as tens of millions did \u2013 in the 1960s involved actually going to a shop and handing over cash to buy a physical object. That\u2019s rather different from merely tapping a screen, which is the only transaction required to register as a YouTube fan. Moreover, Charles\u2019s narrow celebrity within his own fanbase is hardly comparable to the near-saturation mainstream media coverage attracted by the Fab Four, whose global presence in 60s culture was overwhelming and ubiquitous. My grandmother, who never bought or listened to a popular music recording in her life, couldn\u2019t help but recognise the faces and know the names of all four members of the band. YouTubers such as Charles bear a much greater resemblance to the more ephemeral end of the celebrity spectrum. Think of authors such as Dornford Yates: massively popular in the 1930s, but almost forgotten today. What will be remembered of John Charles a few decades hence?

According to letters circulated among employees \u2013 and seen by the Guardian \u2013 the bookmaker will close up to 1,000 of its 3,500 shops over the next 18 to 24 months, blaming imminent curbs on \u00a3100-per-spin fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs). Redundancies will be decided via a ranking system, with staff grouped by area and competing against each other on a range of criteria to escape the axe. The proposals prompted concern from trade union Community and the Labour MP and gambling campaigner Carolyn Harris. Customer service managers, among the roles being targeted, will be judged partly on performance in an online test, accounting for 40% of their score, while a face-to-face interview will make up 20% and past disciplinary record will count for 10%. A further 30% of their score will be based on the number of customers they can persuade to set up new online accounts, helping the company offset lost FOBT revenue. Harris, who chairs a cross-party group on gambling-related harm, said: \u201cIt is totally disgraceful that staff in bookmakers are being made to compete for their jobs in this way. \u201cI am also appalled, although sadly not surprised, that staff are being asked to take advantage of vulnerable people and urge them to sign up for online accounts. \u201cWe are dealing with the scourge of FOBTs but at the same time bookmakers are seemingly seeking to drive problems online.

In the memo to staff, Ladbrokes said it would not take any decision on which shops to close until it had finished a 45-day period of \u201ccollective consultation\u201d. No dismissals will happen before 1 May, within days of legislation coming into force that cuts the maximum stake on FOBTs from \u00a3100 to \u00a32, effectively rendering them uneconomic. While some staff will be made redundant, others will have their contracts reduced to 36 hours a week.

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s nothing like an international fashion fallout to highlight a stark reality. In the case of China, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/dolce-and-gabbana\">the furore</a> around the cancelled Dolce &amp; Gabbana show in Shanghai last November amid allegations of racism related to the accompanying campaign did just that \u2013 but not just for the obvious reasons.</p> <p>Resultant headlines post-event (or post non-event) highlighted to those who didn\u2019t already know just why offending consumers in China could be so damaging: it currently makes up 32% of global luxury consumption and <a href=\"https://qz.com/1482850/china-is-set-to-overtake-the-us-as-the-worlds-largest-fashion-market/\">is forecast to overtake the US as the world\u2019s largest fashion market</a> in 2019.</p> <p>They are statistics that the fashion industry isn\u2019t unaware of. The British Fashion Council has partnered with China\u2019s largest retailer, JD.com, since 2017 to help introduce British designers to the lucrative market as well as fund its annual Vogue and GQ prizes. Its partner and supporter, the Value Retail-owned outlet Bicester Village, is also more than aware of the numbers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"854899999e1c467b21c2dbb3c7eedd0324caf2d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/854899999e1c467b21c2dbb3c7eedd0324caf2d9/0_0_2571_3468/741.jpg\" alt=\"Susie Lau, AKA Susie Bubble.\" width=\"741\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Susie Lau, AKA Susie Bubble.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is the second most popular tourist attraction in the England (Buckingham Palace takes the top spot) for Chinese tourists \u2013 Chinese customers accounted for \u201c40% of total tax refunded sales\u201d there in 2018, it says, all eager to snap up a tax-free designer bargain and satisfy the increasing demand for newness. London Marylebone station, which serves the station, was even forced to make loudspeaker announcements in Mandarin after a surge in tourists using the station for travel. To kick off 2019 and mark Chinese New Year, it has tapped the original fashion blogger Susie Lau (<a href=\"http://stylebubble.co.uk/\">Susie Bubble</a>) to curate a pop-up shop dedicated to Chinese designers, called Celebrating China.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really well-timed initiative as there has been a lot of focus on how we treat Chinese consumers and how western brands handle cultural sensitivities,\u201d says Lau. She says that the D&amp;G backlash \u201cteaches every brand a lesson on how to create campaigns for a Chinese audience and how to react when something does get flagged up\u201d. She also notes what many international brands have found. \u201cThe domestic [Chinese] audience is much more savvy then it was 10 years ago ... they are more educated and choosy with individual style and a voracious appetite, which is why brands want to court them.\u201d</p> <p>As well as cater to the Chinese audience, Lau wants the pop-up shop to highlight the design talent emerging from the country, too. \u201cThis [pop-up] gives a different angle to what China is now for people who can\u2019t travel to Shanghai to see it happening. I can\u2019t stress enough how inspired I am every time I have been out there \u2013 Shanghai has so much talent from designers who are referencing their culture but in a nuanced way.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/oct/02/saint-laurents-dreams-of-the-orient-when-you-know-a-culture-you-cant-make-mistakes\">Saint Laurent's Dreams of the Orient: 'When you know a culture, you can't make mistakes'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lau has selected an edit from the brands Huishan Zhang, Ryan Lo, Anais Jourden, Mukzin, I Am Chen, Marie Yat, Xu Zhi, Matter Matter, Yang Li and Snow Xue Gao to showcase in the shop. Not all designers hail from China, some have Chinese heritage and have grown up and studied elsewhere. They are all names that Lau has been tracking for a while.</p> <p>\u201cThere has never been a better time to show off beautiful, slightly lesser known fashion brands as the increasing appetite for \u2018newness\u2019 is omnipresent,\u201d says the Bicester Village business director John Durnin. \u201cWe have always been keen to nurture up-and-coming talent, offering these young designers a platform to showcase their collections to a UK and global audience, introducing them to new customers from around the world.\u201d</p> <p>Following its official launch, the pop-up is already off to a good start, with Lau\u2019s edit offering something different to what else is on offer at Bicester, she says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great platform for those designers \u2013 the people that are coming in know their stuff and are very discerning. This specific mix of names reflect where Chinese fashion is at today and there\u2019s something for everyone.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s nothing like an international fashion fallout to highlight a stark reality. In the case of China, the furore around the cancelled Dolce &amp; Gabbana show in Shanghai last November amid allegations of racism related to the accompanying campaign did just that \u2013 but not just for the obvious reasons. Resultant headlines post-event (or post non-event) highlighted to those who didn\u2019t already know just why offending consumers in China could be so damaging: it currently makes up 32% of global luxury consumption and is forecast to overtake the US as the world\u2019s largest fashion market in 2019. They are statistics that the fashion industry isn\u2019t unaware of. The British Fashion Council has partnered with China\u2019s largest retailer, JD.com, since 2017 to help introduce British designers to the lucrative market as well as fund its annual Vogue and GQ prizes. Its partner and supporter, the Value Retail-owned outlet Bicester Village, is also more than aware of the numbers. It is the second most popular tourist attraction in the England (Buckingham Palace takes the top spot) for Chinese tourists \u2013 Chinese customers accounted for \u201c40% of total tax refunded sales\u201d there in 2018, it says, all eager to snap up a tax-free designer bargain and satisfy the increasing demand for newness. London Marylebone station, which serves the station, was even forced to make loudspeaker announcements in Mandarin after a surge in tourists using the station for travel. To kick off 2019 and mark Chinese New Year, it has tapped the original fashion blogger Susie Lau (Susie Bubble) to curate a pop-up shop dedicated to Chinese designers, called Celebrating China. \u201cIt\u2019s a really well-timed initiative as there has been a lot of focus on how we treat Chinese consumers and how western brands handle cultural sensitivities,\u201d says Lau. She says that the D&amp;G backlash \u201cteaches every brand a lesson on how to create campaigns for a Chinese audience and how to react when something does get flagged up\u201d. She also notes what many international brands have found. \u201cThe domestic [Chinese] audience is much more savvy then it was 10 years ago ... they are more educated and choosy with individual style and a voracious appetite, which is why brands want to court them.\u201d As well as cater to the Chinese audience, Lau wants the pop-up shop to highlight the design talent emerging from the country, too. \u201cThis [pop-up] gives a different angle to what China is now for people who can\u2019t travel to Shanghai to see it happening. I can\u2019t stress enough how inspired I am every time I have been out there \u2013 Shanghai has so much talent from designers who are referencing their culture but in a nuanced way.\u201d Lau has selected an edit from the brands Huishan Zhang, Ryan Lo, Anais Jourden, Mukzin, I Am Chen, Marie Yat, Xu Zhi, Matter Matter, Yang Li and Snow Xue Gao to showcase in the shop. Not all designers hail from China, some have Chinese heritage and have grown up and studied elsewhere. They are all names that Lau has been tracking for a while. \u201cThere has never been a better time to show off beautiful, slightly lesser known fashion brands as the increasing appetite for \u2018newness\u2019 is omnipresent,\u201d says the Bicester Village business director John Durnin. \u201cWe have always been keen to nurture up-and-coming talent, offering these young designers a platform to showcase their collections to a UK and global audience, introducing them to new customers from around the world.\u201d Following its official launch, the pop-up is already off to a good start, with Lau\u2019s edit offering something different to what else is on offer at Bicester, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a great platform for those designers \u2013 the people that are coming in know their stuff and are very discerning. This specific mix of names reflect where Chinese fashion is at today and there\u2019s something for everyone. This new generation of creatives are really paving the way forward \u2013 plus it\u2019s a pretty souped up shopping experience.\u201d Celebrating China is open now until February 17.",

But, in the case of Northern Ireland, the mirror is broken. Sinn Fein MPs do not take their seats, the nationalist SDLP lost all its seats at the 2017 general election and now the only Northern Ireland party represented in the Commons is the DUP. (Northern Ireland does also have Sylvia Hermon, who voted remain, but she has little clout because she is an independent without a party behind her.) On Brexit, the DUP roughly overlaps with the European Research Group. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/feb/04/brexit-latest-news-developments-pm-asks-mps-to-find-alternative-arrangements-to-backstop-as-eu-insists-those-ideas-wont-work-politics-live?page=with:block-5c58718ae4b0d86c56438d68#block-5c58718ae4b0d86c56438d68\">Even DUP voters don\u2019t support DUP policy on Brexit</a>, and it certainly does not represent the population of Northern Ireland as a whole, who voted 56% remain.</p> \n  <p>Yet, if you follow Brexit through what gets said at Westminster, it would be easy to lulled into the false impression that Northern Ireland is a land dominated by Brussels-baiting Sammy Wilsons. That would be a mistake.</p> \n  <p><strong>Theresa May</strong> must know this. Yet she did seem rather taken aback by the question she got from local journalists after her speech, most of which were about how her recent backstop U-turn went down very badly with the business leaders in Northern Ireland who defended her original plan even though <a href=\"https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/brexit-sammy-wilson-says-ufu-and-business-leaders-are-puppets-of-ni-office-1-8711528\">that led to them being branded \u201cpuppets of the [Northern Ireland] Office\u201d by the DUP.</a></p> \n  <p>Pushed onto the defensive, May probably revealed more than she intended. Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>May signalled that her intention is to change the backstop, not get it removed entirely from the withdrawal agreement.</strong> Referring to the backstop, she said: \u201cI\u2019m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that does not contain that insurance policy for the future.\u201d (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/feb/05/brexit-latest-news-developments-theresa-may-speech-northern-ireland-eu-will-be-to-blame-if-theres-no-deal-says-transport-secretary-chris-grayling-politics-live?page=with:block-5c59ac8be4b042feedcb7a00#block-5c59ac8be4b042feedcb7a00\"> 3.41pm</a> and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/feb/05/brexit-latest-news-developments-theresa-may-speech-northern-ireland-eu-will-be-to-blame-if-theres-no-deal-says-transport-secretary-chris-grayling-politics-live?page=with:block-5c59aebae4b04a6f567d94b8#block-5c59aebae4b04a6f567d94b8\"> 3.50pm.) </a>Last week May persuaded MPs to pass <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/29/brexit-vote-commons-latest-news-developments-liam-fox-says-may-now-saying-withdrawal-deal-text-must-be-rewritten-politics-live?page=with:block-5c50b743e4b0fbf19bc3be72#block-5c50b743e4b0fbf19bc3be72\">an amendment saying the backstop should be \u201creplaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border\u201d. </a>May subsequently said that replacing the backstop could involve either using technology to avoid a hard border, or getting legal changes to the deal setting a time limit for the backstop or giving the UK a unilateral right to withdraw. Officially all three of those options are being considered, a colleague who has just returned from the afternoon lobby briefing tells me. But, on the basis of what May herself said, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the alternative technical arrangements option is a non-starter, and that May is now only really serious about either a time limit, or unilateral withdrawal.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>May expressed reservations about the alternative technical arrangements option. </strong>In her speech she hinted that relying on technology to replace the backstop might not be practical. She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>While I have said that technology could play a part, and that we will look at alternative arrangements, these must be ones that can be made to work for the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This will probably not go down well with the alternative arrangements working group, which has been in the Cabinet Office today working on just these plans.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aea60a3513e91a3924149c35110686d297ba94f6\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aea60a3513e91a3924149c35110686d297ba94f6/0_52_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Left to right: Theresa Villiers, Nicky Morgan, Damian Green, Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson, Tory MPs who attended a meeting in the Cabinet Office as members of the alternative arrangements working group\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Left to right: Theresa Villiers, Nicky Morgan, Damian Green, Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson, Tory MPs who attended a meeting in the Cabinet Office as members of the alternative arrangements working group</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>May floated the idea of a joint UK-Ireland bid for the World Cup, as a means of strengthening links between the two countries.</strong> She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will also want to strengthen our economic relationship and have already together identified areas like construction and smart cities as ripe for enhanced collaboration. </p> \n   <p>And both the UK and the Irish governments have already made clear that we would support the tantalising possibility of a joint UK and Ireland World Cup bid for 2030, should our respective football associations choose to pursue this.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said the UK\u2019s relationship with Ireland was closer than with any other member of the EU.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our relationship with Ireland is deeper than our relationship with any of the other 27.

The ceremony at Messines in 2017, attended by HRH the Duke of Cambridge and former taoiseach Enda Kenny was particularly poignant, as it remembered the soldiers of the 16th Irish and 36th Ulster Division who both played a key role in the Allied victory in that battle.</p> \n   <p>Today those ties of family and friendship between our countries are more important than they have ever been. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said her commitment to avoid a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland was \u201cunshakable\u201d.</strong><br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16b3c7451bb96ccebd59c3cb9f700a6285c9b6da\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16b3c7451bb96ccebd59c3cb9f700a6285c9b6da/1165_212_1671_1003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Therea May speaking at Allstate in Belfast\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Therea May speaking at Allstate in Belfast</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liam McBurney/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-05T16:58:47.615Z\">at 4.58pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c59b229e4b04a6f567d950b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rorycarroll\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-05T15:56:49.268Z\">3.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The audience of Northern Ireland business owners and executives gave lukewarm applause to the prime minister\u2019s speech.<br></p> \n  <p>Several expressed frustration that her plan to avoid a hard border and disruption to trade remained unclear. \u201cWe\u2019re none the wiser,\u201d said one.</p> \n  <p><strong>Aodh\u00e1n Connolly</strong>, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said he hoped a meeting with May after her speech would clarify how she intended to reconcile promises on the backstop with avoiding a hard border. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about the disintegration of the supply chain.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May has signalled that she will demand changes to the way the backstop operates, not its full removal from the withdrawal agreement, when she returns to Brussels to renegotiate her Brexit deal. (See 4.48pm.) This is being seen by some Tories as a watering down of the commitment she gave in the Commons last week when she persuaded MPs to back an amendment saying the backstop should be \u201creplaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border\u201d. (See 4.57pm.) Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has accused Brussels and Dublin of \u201cintransigence\u201d which could lead to the UK leaving Europe without a deal. May is to return to Brussels on Thursday seeking fresh concessions despite the EU\u2019s insistence that the bloc will not renegotiate the Brexit deal. Moves to protect UK food and drink names in the event of a no-deal Brexit have been outlined by the government. As the Press Association reports, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the aim of the initiative is to safeguard the geographical indication (GI) that confirms where a product originates from. Defra will manage protection schemes and process new applications. Nicola Sturgeon has played down the prospects of an early vote on Scottish independence by warning her supporters that \u201ccalm consideration\u201d was needed first. The Labour MP David Lammy has accused the government of \u201cpandering to far-right racism\u201d in its handling of the Windrush row and with its decision to deport about 50 people to Jamaica. MPs are debating how much England\u2019s councils will have to spend in the next financial year, after local authorities complained of a \u00a33bn funding gap, as the BBC reports. Plans for a statue of \u201cdivisive figure\u201d Margaret Thatcher to be erected in her home town have been approved despite vandalism concerns. As the Press Association reports, a planning committee unanimously voted in favour of the 30,000 statue which was originally intended for Parliament Square in Westminster. The statue is set to stand on a 10ft-high granite plinth due to fears of a \u201cmotivated far-left movement ... who may be committed to public activism\u201d. The Scottish parliament has set up a new committee to examine how the Scottish government handled complaints made against former First Minister Alex Salmond, Holyrood reports. That\u2019s all from me for today. We hope to be able to keep the comments open until about 7pm. Thanks for all those posted already. Donald Tusk, the European council president, will meet Theresa May in Brussels on Thursday afternoon, Number 10 has said, after her meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president. Sinn Fein has accused Theresa May of bad faith over the backstop. In a statement (which, admittedly, reads as if it was drafted before May\u2019s speech was delivered), the Sinn Fein leader in Northern Ireland Michelle O\u2019Neill said: Theresa May and the British government have a serious credibility issue. She negotiated a legally binding solution in the backstop to prevent a hard border on this island with the European Union, and is now attempting to abandon that agreement. There is uniformity from the four pro-remain parties in the north, the Irish government and the EU member states that there can be no renegotiation of the backstop - it is fundamental to the withdrawal agreement. Theresa May must understand that no amount of warm words and platitudes will be acceptable to Sinn F\u00e9in, citizens or businesses here. Only the legally binding backstop can guarantee certainty, prevent a hard border and protect the Good Friday agreement framework. We told shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer this yesterday and we will tell Theresa May that tomorrow. The DUP do not speak for the people of the north of Ireland - and are doing a huge disservice to our people, businesses, farming industry and key sectors of the economy by misrepresenting our interests. This will continue to be opposed and resisted at every turn. Responding to Theresa May\u2019s comments during her Q&amp;A about the backstop (see 4.48pm), a source from the European Research Group, which represents Tories pushing for a harder Brexit, said: Even if she doesn\u2019t mean what she said, we still do. The House of Commons is meant to ensure that the views of all corners of the United Kingdom get reflected at Westminster. But, in the case of Northern Ireland, the mirror is broken. Sinn Fein MPs do not take their seats, the nationalist SDLP lost all its seats at the 2017 general election and now the only Northern Ireland party represented in the Commons is the DUP. (Northern Ireland does also have Sylvia Hermon, who voted remain, but she has little clout because she is an independent without a party behind her.) On Brexit, the DUP roughly overlaps with the European Research Group. Even DUP voters don\u2019t support DUP policy on Brexit, and it certainly does not represent the population of Northern Ireland as a whole, who voted 56% remain. Yet, if you follow Brexit through what gets said at Westminster, it would be easy to lulled into the false impression that Northern Ireland is a land dominated by Brussels-baiting Sammy Wilsons. That would be a mistake. Theresa May must know this. Yet she did seem rather taken aback by the question she got from local journalists after her speech, most of which were about how her recent backstop U-turn went down very badly with the business leaders in Northern Ireland who defended her original plan even though that led to them being branded \u201cpuppets of the [Northern Ireland] Office\u201d by the DUP. Pushed onto the defensive, May probably revealed more than she intended. Here are the main points. May signalled that her intention is to change the backstop, not get it removed entirely from the withdrawal agreement. Referring to the backstop, she said: \u201cI\u2019m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that does not contain that insurance policy for the future.\u201d (See 3.41pm and 3.50pm.) Last week May persuaded MPs to pass an amendment saying the backstop should be \u201creplaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border\u201d. May subsequently said that replacing the backstop could involve either using technology to avoid a hard border, or getting legal changes to the deal setting a time limit for the backstop or giving the UK a unilateral right to withdraw. Officially all three of those options are being considered, a colleague who has just returned from the afternoon lobby briefing tells me. But, on the basis of what May herself said, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the alternative technical arrangements option is a non-starter, and that May is now only really serious about either a time limit, or unilateral withdrawal. May expressed reservations about the alternative technical arrangements option. In her speech she hinted that relying on technology to replace the backstop might not be practical. She said: While I have said that technology could play a part, and that we will look at alternative arrangements, these must be ones that can be made to work for the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland. This will probably not go down well with the alternative arrangements working group, which has been in the Cabinet Office today working on just these plans. May floated the idea of a joint UK-Ireland bid for the World Cup, as a means of strengthening links between the two countries. She said: We will also want to strengthen our economic relationship and have already together identified areas like construction and smart cities as ripe for enhanced collaboration. And both the UK and the Irish governments have already made clear that we would support the tantalising possibility of a joint UK and Ireland World Cup bid for 2030, should our respective football associations choose to pursue this. She said the UK\u2019s relationship with Ireland was closer than with any other member of the EU. Our relationship with Ireland is deeper than our relationship with any of the other 27. It is uniquely rooted in ties of family, history and geography. The recent past has been a moment of reflection in the UK and Ireland as we have commemorated the centenary of a series of key events in our shared history. Ireland remembered the centenary of the Easter Rising in an inclusive manner which promoted a greater understanding of our often troubled history. While our two countries remembered together the shared sacrifice of so many who fought side by side in the first world war. The ceremony at Messines in 2017, attended by HRH the Duke of Cambridge and former taoiseach Enda Kenny was particularly poignant, as it remembered the soldiers of the 16th Irish and 36th Ulster Division who both played a key role in the Allied victory in that battle. Today those ties of family and friendship between our countries are more important than they have ever been. She said her commitment to avoid a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland was \u201cunshakable\u201d. The audience of Northern Ireland business owners and executives gave lukewarm applause to the prime minister\u2019s speech. Several expressed frustration that her plan to avoid a hard border and disruption to trade remained unclear. \u201cWe\u2019re none the wiser,\u201d said one. Aodh\u00e1n Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said he hoped a meeting with May after her speech would clarify how she intended to reconcile promises on the backstop with avoiding a hard border. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about the disintegration of the supply chain. Northern Ireland is in the eye of the storm.\u201d Journalists challenged May over her credibility with Northern Ireland business leaders given that she had mobilised them to campaign for a deal with the backstop, only to dump it. Connolly said she still had credibility. \u201cWe realise she is in a hard political game. But we need certainty and we need it now.\u201d Here is PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield on the plan for a UK-Ireland joint 2030 World Cup bid tentatively floated by Theresa May. (See 3.20pm) And this is from AP\u2019s Rob Harris. And here is Theresa May\u2019s answer to the third question (see 3.26pm), when she was asked why business leaders in Northern Ireland who defended the original backstop plan should trust her following her U-turn on the issue. May replied: First of all, let\u2019s be very clear about this. You\u2019ve used the phrase U-turn in your question. There is no suggestion that we are not going to ensure that in the future there is provision for this, it has been called an insurance policy, the backstop, that ensures that if the future relationship is not in place by the end of the implementation period, there will be arrangements in place to ensure that we deliver no hard border. Our commitment to that remains. What parliament has said, what the House of Commons has said, is that they want to see changes to the backstop as it currently exists within the protocol as part of the withdrawal agreement. The issue that has always been one that parliament has raised - it has been raised across all sides of the House of Commons - is the potential indefinite nature of the backstop. That\u2019s the issue we look to address. There are a number of ways to do it ... The commitment to no hard border absolutely remains, as Sir Graham Brady\u2019s amendment that passed the House of Commons made clear, and to leave the European Union with a deal. Here is Theresa May\u2019s response to the second question (see 3.24pm), which was about why people in Northern Ireland, who were in favour of the original backstop plan, would support a plan with no backstop in it. May replied: I\u2019m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that does not contain that insurance policy for the future. What parliament has said is that they believe there should be changes made to the backstop. And it is in that vein, in that light, that we are working with politicians across Westminster, across the House of Commons - but also we will be working with others, with the Irish government and with the EU - to find a way that enables us to maintain our commitments that we have set very clearly for no hard border, but to do it in a way that provides a withdrawal agreement and a political declaration for the future that can command support across the House of Commons, and therefore that we will be able to ratify with the European Union. Q: Lord Bew has said the UK government has not challenged the Irish government\u2019s narrative on the Good Friday agreement being under threat. Do you agree? May says she is committed to the Good Friday agreement. She was clear in the December 2017 joint report that she would maintain Northern Ireland\u2019s place. And that\u2019s it. I will post a summary shortly. Q: Many business leaders here, who argued for the backstop, will feel that you have \u201cshafted\u201d them. Why should they trust you now? May says she is arguing for changes to the backstop, not for its entire removal. There are a number of ways in which this could be achieved, she says. She says the commitment to no hard border remains. We lost the first question because the feed went down. Q: Some 56% of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain. How will you persuade people here to accept a deal with no backstop? May says she is not proposing a deal with no backstop. What she is saying is that there must be changes to the backstop. May says she wants changes to the backstop, not its entire removal. May says she wants to see the devolved administration restored in Northern Ireland. She ends by saying she will do her utmost to preserve peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland. May says the ties of family and friendship between the UK and Ireland are more important than ever. There is a yearning for a close relationship. That is why she will work with Leo Varadkar, the Irish PM, to achieve this. She says the Irish government has suggested annual meetings, where both PMs and their ministers could come together to discuss issues. May floats the prospect of the UK and Ireland staging a joint World Cup bid for 2030, provided the respective football associations approve the idea. May says she also wants the strongest possible bilateral relationship with Ireland. The UK\u2019s relationship with it is deeper than its relationship with any other member of the EU27. May says, with just unionists represented in the Commons, it is more important than ever to ensure that the rights of all in Northern Ireland are respected. That is why she is sitting down for talks with all the political parties in Northern Ireland tomorrow, she says. May says she will uphold the rights people have under the GFA. She knows some nationalists are worried. That is why the existing agreement includes provisions for no diminution of rights. May says she wants to ensure that existing north-south cooperation mechanisms can continue. May says she does not want to create an effective border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. That is why she opposed the EU plan for a NI-only backstop. May reaffirms her commitment to avoiding a hard border. She has spoken to businesses, and to people living at the border, and knows how disruptive a hard border would be. She says any alternative arrangements to the backstop \u201cmust be made to work for the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland\u201d. May says many people in Northern Ireland will worry about decisions taken in Westminster having a negative impact on their life. That is why she wants to get broad support for her deal in Northern Ireland. May says she defended the backstop. But parliament did not approve it. And in Northern Ireland the two main unionist parties both opposed it too. So that is why she is seeking changes to it, she says. She says MPs backed the Brady amendment. The amendment says the backstop must be replaced. May says her commitment to the principles behind the Good Friday agreement is absolute. In December 2017, the UK and the EU agreed to protect the GFA in all its parts. These commitments were made in good faith, she says. She says she wants to avoid no hard border through the future relationship. But she accepted the need for an insurance policy in the withdrawal agreement. That led to the backstop. But, unlike the original EU proposal, the eventual backstop avoided putting up a border between east and west. May says a fundamental belief in the union is part of her heritage as a Conservative. But her unionism accepts the right of people in Northern Ireland to be Irish if that is what they want. And it involves treating everyone with respect, she says. May says she is in Northern Ireland to stress her commitment to the people there, to the Good Friday agreement, and to its successor agreements. She says she she was 12 when the Troubles started, and 41 when the Good Friday agreement was signed. Her commitment to its is \u201cunshakeable\u201d. She says although violence has not been eliminated, it has been reduced to levels that once would have seemed unimaginable. Theresa May is speaking in Belfast now. She starts by saying the government has come a long way in the last two and a half years towards finding a Brexit that works for Northern Ireland. A memorial to German philosopher Karl Marx has been attacked with a hammer and \u201cwill never be the same again\u201d, a charity has said. As the Press Association reports, the Friends of Highgate Cemetery Trust, the charity which runs the cemetery in north London, said the marble plaque on Marx\u2019s grave appeared to have been attacked with a hammer over the weekend in what looked like \u201ca deliberate attack on the memory of Karl Marx himself\u201d. Ian Dungavell, the trust\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cHis name has been singled out, although the person wasn\u2019t particularly co-ordinated.\u201d The \u201cdeliberate and sustained attack\u201d on the Grade I-listed monument, which puts it on a par with the most important buildings in the country, was \u201cvery upsetting\u201d, he said. A UK version of the EU\u2019s council of ministers should be set up to deal with powers shared between Westminster and the devolved administrations following Brexit, a former Scottish first minister has said. As the Press Association reports, Lord McConnell called for \u201cfundamental change\u201d in power structures, including a nations and regions secretary of equal standing to a deputy prime minister. Giving evidence to the Commons Scottish affairs committee, McConnell, who led Holyrood\u2019s Labour and Liberal Democrat coalition between 2001 and 2007, said: I think after Brexit, when you have quite clearly some of the powers that are being repatriated from Brussels but also Britain\u2019s new role in the world in terms of trade deals and so on, that I think so many of these areas involve both devolved and reserved powers that I think there is a need to have a new structure. I think there needs to be a fundamental change. I think in the UK cabinet there should be a secretary of state, either for the nations and regions or for constitutional affairs, that person in my view would almost automatically be a sort of deputy prime minister-type individual ... Alongside that ... you need a formal process for decision-making on areas where there is clearly going to be shared legislative responsibility post-Brexit. That\u2019s why alongside that department I think you should have a UK council of ministers. Here are the main points from the Number 10 lobby briefing. At cabinet ministers did discuss the local government finance settlement and Zimbabwe too, but the longest discussion, lasting 45 minutes to an hour, was on Brexit. At the lobby briefing afterwards it was almost 100% Brexit. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman implied that Theresa May will have new proposals to put to the EU for the backstop when she goes to Brussels on Thursday. He would not give details, but he said that work was \u201cgoing on urgently\u201d on the three ideas being considered by the government and that \u201cit is important for that work to take place before we go to Brussels\u201d. Two of the ideas would involve ensuring the UK could not be kept in the backstop, either by imposing a time limit on it, or by creating a mechanism that would enable the UK to leave unilaterally. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, is working on these proposals. And the third would involve replacing the backstop with alternative customs arrangements intended to avoid a hard border in Ireland, an option being explored by the alternative arrangements working group. The spokesman refused to say whether May was planning to chose just one of these ideas to put to the EU as the UK\u2019s preference, or whether all three would end up on the table. Downing Street refused to endorse Chris Grayling\u2019s claim that the EU would be to blame if the UK left the EU with no deal. (See 9.02am.) When asked if the PM agreed with Grayling\u2019s comment, her spokesman just said: What is required is for both sides to work together to achieve what both state is their aim, which is for the UK to leave with a deal. May told cabinet that last week\u2019s debate showed there was no support in the Commons for a second referendum, the spokesman said. When it was put to him that MPs did not vote on a second referendum last week, he said \u201cthe point is, MPs who have been advocating a people\u2019s vote chose not to put an amendment to the vote.\u201d That meant they knew they did not have the support of the Commons, he suggested. This claim has angered the Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, a supporter of the People\u2019s Vote campaign. May told cabinet that the UK must and will leave the EU on 29 March, the spokesman said. He was asked if this leak from cabinet was accurate. The spokesman replied said the Newton Dunn\u2019s tweet was \u201cin keeping with the spirit of the PM\u2019s remarks\u201d, if not a verbatim quote. The spokesman said that no one at cabinet proposed extending article 50. May told cabinet that the backstop needed to be changed, not just because of Tory and DUP objections to it, but because of Labour concerns too, the spokesman said. (See 1.04pm.) The spokesman suggested that the EU would be willing to re-open the withdrawal agreement, despite the fact that it is currently saying this won\u2019t be possible. Asked about this, he said that the EU wants the UK to leave with a deal and that the current deal has been rejected by parliament. Asked if he was accusing the EU of bluster, he replied: \u201cI\u2019m not saying that.\u201d The spokesman would not comment on a HuffPost report saying Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, is planning to use ministerial powers to cut tariffs on all imports to zero in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The spokesman said he was not aware of the story. The spokesman confirmed that Gavin Barwell, May\u2019s chief of staff, was in Brussels yesterday for talks with EU politicians and officials. The spokesman said that David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, will be taking PMQs tomorrow. May will miss it because she will still be in Northern Ireland, where she has meetings lined up tomorrow with all the political parties. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, was accused of \u201cpandering to a far-right racism\u201d by Labour\u2019s David Lammy after he revealed three more people wrongly deported in the Windrush scandal have now died. As the Press Association reports, in an urgent question in the Commons, Javid said after further review 18 people were wrongly sent back to the Caribbean, and he had written to 15 of them to apologise. After Javid said the remaining three were now deceased, Lammy called it \u201cnothing less than a national scandal\u201d. He told Javid: Every single one of these cases is a shocking indictment of your government\u2019s pandering to a far-right racism, sham immigration targets and the dog-whistle of the right-wing press. The Labour former minister also hit out at stories this week of a charter flight to Jamaica deporting \u201cup to 50 black British residents\u201d. Lammy asked Javid if he was sure he \u201cnot making the same mistakes\u201d as with Windrush, adding: \u201cOnce enslaved, then colonised, and now repatriated.\u201d And he went on: We are now 20 years on from the Macpherson Review, which found there was \u2018institutional racism\u2019 in this country. I ask the home secretary, why is it that still in this country black lives matter less? In response, Javid said the scheduled deportations were a charter flight \u201cof foreign national offenders only\u201d, and that \u201cevery single one of them [was] convicted of a serious crime\u201d. As the Press Association reports, he said it was a \u201clegal requirement\u201d and that Lammy was asking him to \u201cbreak the law\u201d by not sending them to Jamaica. Javid also said that some of those Windrush generation members who died after being deported were sent back as a result of decisions made while Lammy himself was in government under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. I\u2019m just back from the Downing Street lobby briefing. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman was reluctant to confirm directly that Theresa May will have a fully worked-up alternative to the backstop for the EU to consider when she goes to Brussels on Thursday, but he implied that she will at least have some ideas to put on the table for the meeting. This is how the spokesman summarised what was said at cabinet about Brexit. Cabinet agreed that it was positive that, for the first time, parliament had indicated that it could support the withdrawal agreement, subject to changes to the backstop, and that it had reiterated its commitment to both avoiding a hard border and leaving the EU with a deal. The prime minister said that our objective now is to secure a legally-binding way of guaranteeing we cannot be trapped indefinitely in the backstop. To achieve this, we have launched urgent pieces of work examining alternative arrangements to the backstop and considering legal changes that could provide a unilateral exit mechanism or a time limit to the backstop. The PM said the discussions with the EU will not be easy, but parliament has sent a clear message that a change to the backstop is the only way to get a deal approved. The PM added that last week showed that a second referendum does not have the support of the House. She said that, while Labour did not whip for the Brady amendment, Jeremy Corbyn has said he also has concerns about the backstop, so this is an issue that needs to be resolved not just for \u201cour colleagues\u201d, by which the prime minister obviously meant Conservative colleagues, and the DUP, but for MPs across the House. And here are the key lines. May told cabinet that the government was urgently working up alternatives to the backstop. She claimed last week\u2019s debate showed there was no support in the Commons for a second referendum. MPs did not actually vote on a second referendum last week, but the spokesman said that May took the view that the fact that MPs supporting a second referendum did not table a cross-party amendment on this showed that they knew they did not have the support to win. May told cabinet that the backstop needed to be changed, not just because of Tory and DUP objections to it, but because of Labour concerns too. I will post a full summary shortly. Ryan Heath, Politico Europe\u2019s political editor, thinks Theresa May\u2019s visit to Brussels on Thursday will be pointless. I\u2019m just off to the lobby briefing to find out if Number 10 can explain what the visit might achieve. I will post again after 12.30pm. And here is the Press Association on Theresa May\u2019s visit to Brussels on Thursday. Prime Minister Theresa May is to meet European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels on Thursday, the commission\u2019s spokesman has announced. The spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, also said that Juncker will meet Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Brussels on Wednesday. The first briefing from today\u2019s cabinet is already out. Theresa May is going to Brussels on Thursday, the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming reports. Yesterday the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs published advice for the fishing industry on what will be needed if people want to export fish to the EU after 29 March in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It won\u2019t the straightforward, the document suggests. They will definitely need a catch certificate and an export health certificate (except for direct landings from UK-flagged fishing vessels) and they may also need a prior notification form, a pre-landing declaration, a storage document and a processing statement. The mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence has said it is \u201cunbelievable\u201d that inquiries into the aftermath of her son\u2019s death are still ongoing after nearly 26 years. A public inquiry into undercover policing, which has been beset by delays, is looking at claims that grieving families were spied on as they campaigned for justice, including the Lawrences. As the Press Association reports, giving evidence to the home affairs committee, Doreen Lawrence accused the Metropolitan police of trying to avoid giving the \u201ctrue facts\u201d of what undercover officers did to the inquiry. She said: The undercover inquiry that\u2019s happening now, the police are doing all that they can not to give the true facts of what happened. Lawrence, who is now a peer, also claimed that chairman Sir John Mitting has not appreciated the lengths an officer would go to in order to keep their activity secret. She said: I don\u2019t think he understands the level of what a police officer would go through in order to deny and to secret whatever it is that they\u2019re doing. This has been going on for three years now and he still hasn\u2019t taken evidence. They\u2019re still going through the paperwork. For me 25 years, coming up to 26 years, and this to be still going on, is unbelievable that any family should have to go through this. Lawrence was giving evidence on progress in the 20 years since the publication of the Macpherson report into the aftermath of her son\u2019s death. LBC\u2019s Matthew Thompson thinks the DUP\u2019s Arlene Foster was wrong to claim, as she did in her Today interview this morning (see 10.14am) that the backstop would undermine Northern Ireland\u2019s relationship with Great Britain - or the east-west relationship, as she put it. Ministers are increasingly concerned the new US congress will side with Dublin in any Brexit dispute over the Good Friday Agreement, Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam reports. His full story is here. Or, if you prefer, here is a Twitter thread with the main points. And here is a summary of the Arlene Foster interview on the Today programme. Foster, the DUP leader, claimed that the \u201cintransigence\u201d of the EU and the Irish government was making a no-deal Brexit more likely. When it was put to her that her party\u2019s hardline stance on the backstop was making a no-deal Brexit more probable, she replied: Well, actually, I could reverse that by saying, through the intransigence of the European Union and the Republic of Ireland in their attitude, they are actually more likely to bring about the very thing that they want to avoid. As my colleague Paul Johnson points out, given its long history of reluctance to make accommodations with others, it\u2019s a bit rich for the DUP to start accusing anyone else of intransigence. She refused to say what sort of changes to the backstop the DUP required, implying that new, legally-binding assurances about it being temporary might be enough. This is significant because, although the EU has ruled out any significant rewriting of the withdrawal agreement, it has hinted that it would be open to adding legally-binding assurances about the temporary nature of the backstop. In the interview Foster was asked what changes to the backstop the DUP wanted. Would it have to go entirely? Or would legally-binding additional assurances be enough? She replied: Well, I think it\u2019s for the prime minister, obviously, to negotiate in relation to these matters. I\u2019m not certainly going to get caught up in the semantics of all of that this morning. I think Brussels have been asking for a clear ask from the United Kingdom government. They now have that clear ask. They have known all along that the backstop causes great difficulties, particularly for those of us who are unionists in Northern Ireland. When it was put to her that she did not seem to be saying the backstop would actually have to be removed from the withdrawal agreement, she replied: The prime minister has to regard what parliament has given her a mandate for. And parliament\u2019s mandate is to replace the backstop. The current backstop, as I\u2019ve said all along, is toxic to those of us living in Northern Ireland, and indeed for unionists right across the United Kingdom, because it would cause the break-up of the United Kingdom into the medium and longer term. Foster\u2019s use of the term \u201ccurrent backstop\u201d was interesting, because she seemed to be implying that, subject to qualifications, the backstop could stay. On the backstop, the Brady amendment passed by MPs last week just said that it required \u201cthe Northern Ireland backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border\u201d. In the debate itself Theresa May insisted that she would be asking for \u201ca significant and legally binding change to the withdrawal agreement\u201d, implying that the actual text of the withdrawal agreement would have to change. This helped May to win the support of Tory Brexiters for the Brady amendment because some of them had been concerned by a suggestion that changing the backstop might not involve redrafting the actual text of the withdrawal agreement, but just clarifying its purpose through some sort of legally-binding addendum. Journalists think Foster\u2019s equivocation was significant. This is from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn. And this is from ITV\u2019s Angus Walker. Last week, ahead of the big Brexit vote, it seemed as if Tory Brexiters would insist on any changes to the backstop involving its wholesale removal, or at last a major rewriting of the withdrawal agreement. But in the last seven days there have been some hints that their stance is shifting. At the weekend Jacob Rees-Mogg, chair of the European Research Group (ERG), which is pushing for a harder Brexit, said he would prefer to avoid a no-deal Brexit, because he thought the prospect of that could lead to MPs voting to delay Brexit. And in his Sun column at the weekend James Forsyth, who has good links with Brexiters, said there was a \u201cgrowing body of opinion in the ERG, the most powerful Brexiteer bloc in the Tory party, that a three-year time limit for the backstop \u2014 which could be extended to five in exceptional circumstances \u2014 could be acceptable\u201d. Foster brushed aside business objections in Northern Ireland to the DUP\u2019s position on the backstop. When it was put to her that businesses in the DUP want the backstop, because it will guarantee an open border, even though her party is opposed, Foster replied: It may keep the north-south border open, but it will cause great difficulties in the east-west border, and I think that is something that concerns me greatly, as the leader of the Democratic Unionist party. And, obviously, constitutionally it causes me great difficulties as well. Here are two more lines from the Chris Grayling interview with Camilla Tominey in the Daily Telegraph (paywall). Grayling insisted that the UK would not delay article 50. He said: I\u2019ve been in every cabinet meeting and there\u2019s been no conversation about delaying post-March 29. We are not delaying article 50. But, when asked about what Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said last week about there being a chance that Brexit might be delayed, Grayling qualified his comment, saying Brexit could be delayed for just a few days. What Jeremy said was very much about if we needed a couple more days to complete the passage of legislation through our parliament and the European parliament. Brexit will still happen on March 29. He claimed that trade would carry on \u201crelatively normally\u201d in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He said: I\u2019m expecting the flow of trade in and out of the country in the event of a no-deal Brexit will carry on relatively normally. Will there be an uninterrupted supply of lettuces from Spain? There will be no problem for those products getting into the UK. The only problem will be delays imposed at the French end as lorries go back either empty or with other products on board but all we can see from the conversations we\u2019re having from the French \u2013 we don\u2019t expect there to be a major problem. We\u2019re being prudent. We\u2019re planning on the assumption that there are significant delays but I\u2019m cautiously optimistic that won\u2019t happen. It is never a good sign in a negotiation when the parties start declaring publicly who will be to blame if it all goes wrong. Theresa May is still hoping to agree a revised deal with the EU by the end of next month - and we will hear from her this afternoon, when she delivers a speech in Northern Ireland - but this morning, in an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Chris Grayling, the transport secretary and one of the most prominent Brexiters in the cabinet, has declared that, if it all goes wrong, it will all be the fault of Brussels. He told the paper (paywall): We have taken to our parliament the deal reached in November and our parliament has said no. We want to work with the EU to reach a deal but if they are not prepared to do that \u2013 they will have to take responsibility that we are heading towards a no-deal exit. If they are not willing to compromise, if they\u2019re not willing to work with us to find common ground \u2013 it will be down to them if there is no deal. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, said something similar on the Today programme this morning. When it was put to her that her party\u2019s hardline stance on the backstop was making a no-deal Brexit more likely, she replied: Well, actually, I could reverse that by saying, through the intransigence of the European Union and the Republic of Ireland in their attitude, they are actually more likely to bring about the very thing that they want to avoid. I will post more from both interview soon. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Theresa May chairs cabinet. 10am: Doreen Lawrence gives evidence to the home affairs committee for its inquiry into the 20th anniversary of the Macpherson Report: 12pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. After 12.30pm: MPs debate the local government spending settlement. Afternoon: May gives her speech in Northern Ireland. As Heather Stewart reports, May will insist she can find a way to deliver a Brexit deal that can win the backing of MPs. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I finish, after the May speech. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "body": "<p>Oliver Mtukudzi, who has died aged 66 of complications from diabetes, was a legend of the Zimbab- wean music scene. Fondly known as Tuku, he was a guitarist, singer and songwriter, celebrated as much for the messages in his lyrics as for the distinctive musical style that became known as Tuku music.</p> <p>Early in his career he worked alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/aug/02/worldmusic.arts\" title=\"\">Thomas Mapfumo</a>, the nation\u2019s other musical hero of the era. But while Mapfumo\u2019s songs were defiantly political, forcing him to live outside the country for much of the Mugabe era, Mtukudzi was far more subtle. He remained in Zimbabwe, where he became the country\u2019s most popular homegrown artist, singing about the problems and aspirations of the people, offering advice through his lyrics and bravely tackling such issues as Aids, but avoided direct political controversy.</p> <p>He sang at events staged by Robert Mugabe\u2019s ruling Zanu-PF, but also performed at the wedding and funeral of the opposition leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/14/morgan-tsvangirai-obituary\" title=\"\">Morgan Tsvangirai</a>. When asked why he did not confront the authorities in his songs, he answered: \u201cMy music is not for the government, my music is for the people.\u201d</p> <p>His most apparently \u201cpolitical\u201d song, the big hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQfNLAio8iU\" title=\"\">Wasakara</a>, gives advice to an elderly man: \u201cYou are spent, it is time to accept you are old.\u201d Was he referring to Mugabe? He refused to say. Later, when Mugabe\u2019s central intelligence organisation asked him to explain lyrics on the album Vhunze Moto (Burning Ember) he is said to have replied: \u201cYou speak Shona, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV7DOtdNZB4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lV7DOtdNZB4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Vhunze Moto by Oliver Mtukudzi</figcaption> </figure>   <p>A prolific songwriter, he recorded an astonishing 67 albums. He also wrote the music for, and starred in, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099890/\" title=\"\">Jit (1990)</a>, the first feature film with an all-Zimbabwean cast, and then the massively popular <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107670/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" title=\"\">Neria</a> (1993), the story of a woman reduced to poverty because customary law did not allow her to inherit her husband\u2019s property.</p> <p>The latter won him the M-Net best soundtrack award from the South African television channel, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhXGyer-cIg\" title=\"\">the title song </a>became yet another hit. For the stage, he wrote and directed Was My Child (1995), a musical drama on the plight of Zimbabwe\u2019s street children. His fame in the west never initially matched that of Mapfumo or the Bhundu Boys, but that changed after the international success of his album Tuku Music in 1999. That year he toured the US alongside the West African celebrities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/01/baaba-maal-review-union-chapel-london\" title=\"\">Baaba Maal </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/21/worldmusic\" title=\"\">Toumani Diabat\u00e9</a>.</p> <p>His profile in the US was helped by the American singer <a href=\"https://www.bonnieraitt.com/\" title=\"\">Bonnie Raitt</a>, who covered his song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL8LA8HxPl0\" title=\"\">Hear Me Lord</a> on her 2002 album Silver Lining. In the UK that year he played the Royal Festival Hall in London, while later visits included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/27/womad-2014-bassekou-kouyate-oliver-mtukudzi-nitin-sawhney\" title=\"\">Womad in 2014</a>.</p> <p>Born in the Highfield township outside what is now Harare but was then Salisbury, the capital of Rhodesia, Oliver was brought up in a devoutly Christian family. The oldest of seven children, he sang in the church choir, and listened to traditional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/01/whats-that-sound-thumb-piano\" title=\"\">mbira thumb-piano music</a> and the drumming of the Shona-speaking Korekore people. Then, in the early 1960s, he first heard the American soul music of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/dec/26/guardianobituaries.usa\" title=\"\">James Brown</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/15/vinylword.joequeenan\" title=\"\">Otis Redding</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/jan/20/usa.world\" title=\"\">Wilson Pickett</a>, after a local businessman had bought a small radio \u201cand the whole community used to go to his shop just to sit and listen\u201d. </p> <p>He bought a simple box guitar and learned to play by trying to imitate the sound of the mbira, although, he said, \u201cprofessional guitarists at the time used to laugh at me. I\u2019ve always been experimental.\u201d</p> <p>Despite opposition from his mother, who warned \u201cdon\u2019t you realise you will never get married if you become a guitar player?\u201d, he continued to practise and to write his own songs.</p> <p>\u201cThe first ones were love songs,\u201d he said, \u201cbut after I left school, I couldn\u2019t get a job, so I started to write about that, about my experiences.\u201d He recorded his first song, Stop After Orange, in 1975, but became famous across what was then Rhodesia in 1977 after he joined the band Wagon Wheels, which also included Mapfumo. Their single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orRGmupfxMg\" title=\"\">Dzandimomotera</a> was a huge hit, spending 11 weeks as the country\u2019s No 1.</p> <p>Mtukudzi left Wagon Wheels to front his own band, the Black Spirits, whose bestselling 1978 album <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OGpF663PTM\" title=\"\">Ndipeiwo Zano</a> (Give Me Advice) was produced by the South African star <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-west-nkosi-1186976.html\" title=\"\">West Nkosi</a>.

      "bodyText": "Oliver Mtukudzi, who has died aged 66 of complications from diabetes, was a legend of the Zimbab- wean music scene. Fondly known as Tuku, he was a guitarist, singer and songwriter, celebrated as much for the messages in his lyrics as for the distinctive musical style that became known as Tuku music. Early in his career he worked alongside Thomas Mapfumo, the nation\u2019s other musical hero of the era. But while Mapfumo\u2019s songs were defiantly political, forcing him to live outside the country for much of the Mugabe era, Mtukudzi was far more subtle. He remained in Zimbabwe, where he became the country\u2019s most popular homegrown artist, singing about the problems and aspirations of the people, offering advice through his lyrics and bravely tackling such issues as Aids, but avoided direct political controversy. He sang at events staged by Robert Mugabe\u2019s ruling Zanu-PF, but also performed at the wedding and funeral of the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai. When asked why he did not confront the authorities in his songs, he answered: \u201cMy music is not for the government, my music is for the people.\u201d His most apparently \u201cpolitical\u201d song, the big hit Wasakara, gives advice to an elderly man: \u201cYou are spent, it is time to accept you are old.\u201d Was he referring to Mugabe? He refused to say. Later, when Mugabe\u2019s central intelligence organisation asked him to explain lyrics on the album Vhunze Moto (Burning Ember) he is said to have replied: \u201cYou speak Shona, don\u2019t you?\u201d A prolific songwriter, he recorded an astonishing 67 albums. He also wrote the music for, and starred in, Jit (1990), the first feature film with an all-Zimbabwean cast, and then the massively popular Neria (1993), the story of a woman reduced to poverty because customary law did not allow her to inherit her husband\u2019s property. The latter won him the M-Net best soundtrack award from the South African television channel, while the title song became yet another hit. For the stage, he wrote and directed Was My Child (1995), a musical drama on the plight of Zimbabwe\u2019s street children. His fame in the west never initially matched that of Mapfumo or the Bhundu Boys, but that changed after the international success of his album Tuku Music in 1999. That year he toured the US alongside the West African celebrities Baaba Maal and Toumani Diabat\u00e9. His profile in the US was helped by the American singer Bonnie Raitt, who covered his song Hear Me Lord on her 2002 album Silver Lining. In the UK that year he played the Royal Festival Hall in London, while later visits included Womad in 2014. Born in the Highfield township outside what is now Harare but was then Salisbury, the capital of Rhodesia, Oliver was brought up in a devoutly Christian family. The oldest of seven children, he sang in the church choir, and listened to traditional mbira thumb-piano music and the drumming of the Shona-speaking Korekore people. Then, in the early 1960s, he first heard the American soul music of James Brown, Otis Redding and Wilson Pickett, after a local businessman had bought a small radio \u201cand the whole community used to go to his shop just to sit and listen\u201d. He bought a simple box guitar and learned to play by trying to imitate the sound of the mbira, although, he said, \u201cprofessional guitarists at the time used to laugh at me. I\u2019ve always been experimental.\u201d Despite opposition from his mother, who warned \u201cdon\u2019t you realise you will never get married if you become a guitar player?\u201d, he continued to practise and to write his own songs. \u201cThe first ones were love songs,\u201d he said, \u201cbut after I left school, I couldn\u2019t get a job, so I started to write about that, about my experiences.\u201d He recorded his first song, Stop After Orange, in 1975, but became famous across what was then Rhodesia in 1977 after he joined the band Wagon Wheels, which also included Mapfumo. Their single Dzandimomotera was a huge hit, spending 11 weeks as the country\u2019s No 1. Mtukudzi left Wagon Wheels to front his own band, the Black Spirits, whose bestselling 1978 album Ndipeiwo Zano (Give Me Advice) was produced by the South African star West Nkosi. Nkosi introduced the South African music style mbaqanga into the Tuku mix. In 1979, when the curfew impos- ed during the war for liberation was lifted, Mtukudzi travelled extensively across the country, playing even in the most remote areas, and in 1980 his album Africa became a soundtrack for the new state of Zimbabwe. Bob Marley had performed at the independence celebrations, and Mtukudzi experimented with adding reggae to his many influences. His singing and songwriting remained powerful to the end. His 2013 album Sarawoga (Left Alone) lamented the death of his musician son Sam, killed in a car crash three years earlier. Mtukudzi collaborated with his friend Hugh Masekela on the latter\u2019s final album, No Borders (2017), while his own final recording, Hanya\u2019Ga (Concern), released in 2018, expressed continuing uneasiness about Zimbabwe\u2019s future even after the ousting of Mugabe. The return to Zimbabwe last year of his old colleague Mapfumo, after 14 years of self-imposed exile in the US, saw Mtukudzi sing and dance on stage at an emotional homecoming concert. Mapfumo described Mtukudzi as \u201cone of the best musicians we ever had\u201d. Mtuzudzi was a goodwill ambassador for the UN children\u2019s fund and was made cavaliere of the Order of Merit by the Italian government. He is survived by his wife, Daisy, and by five children and two grandchildren.",

The last three months have seen the economy slip into its weakest growth spell for six years, and indicate that GDP likely stagnated at the start of 2019 after eking out modest growth of just 0.1% in the fourth quarter.\u201d The drop in the services sector PMI came despite the boost to consumers provided by wages rising faster than prices. Annual growth in earnings has pushed above the 3% level in recent months while inflation has dipped to just over 2% \u2013 bringing an end to the squeeze on living standards caused by the depreciation of the pound following the referendum. The survey showed services sector companies becoming more cautious about hiring new staff \u2013 casting doubt as to whether the recent record levels of employment will be sustained. The report said the reduction in employment was only marginal but was still the first reported for more than six years. People leaving jobs voluntarily were not being replaced, it added. Thomas Pugh, the UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said the slowdown in the economy that began in the final quarter of 2018 had worsened in early 2019. \u201cWorries about future demand now appear to be seeping into hiring decisions, which may start to weigh on employment growth,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, if a Brexit deal is agreed, there should be a substantial amount of pent-up demand ready to give GDP growth a boost.\u201d Latest figures for car sales provided some support to the idea that rising real incomes were helping to offset consumer caution caused by Brexit uncertainty. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders said that while total new car registrations in January were 1.6% lower than a year earlier, sales to individuals were up by 2.9%. In 2018, the average fall was 6.3%.",

      "bodyText": "More than a thousand tickets for the Six Nations have appeared for sale on the controversial website Viagogo for a combined \u00a3370,000, according to Guardian analysis that illustrates the grip wielded by ticket touts over in-demand events. Details of the scale at which Six Nations tickets are being touted prompted concern from the digital minister, Margot James, and condemnation from rugby governing bodies, who warned that Viagogo\u2019s customers risk being refused entry at the turnstile. The Guardian examined 1,155 tickets with a \u201cTrader\u201d label advertised on Viagogo for the Six Nations and found they were being listed for \u00a3369,526, including VAT, delivery costs and booking fees, collected by the website. The true amount of tickets controlled by touts is likely to be much higher, given that the Guardian\u2019s analysis covered only two days of Viagogo listings. These tickets, two-thirds of which were in the hands of just five traders, are listed despite the risk that buyers will be turned away at the door. James said the Guardian\u2019s findings were very concerning. \u201cFans should be able to attend major sporting events at a fair price,\u201d she said. She pointed out that Viagogo was the subject of a court order by the Competition and Markets Authority, which has taken action against the company over alleged breaches of consumer law. \u201cViagogo must now make any necessary changes without delay and I expect the CMA to take further action if they fail to do so,\u201d she said. The CMA has already warned that it has \u201cserious concerns\u201d about Viagogo\u2019s compliance with the terms of the court order. And listings for Six Nations games raise fresh doubts about whether the company is abiding by its terms. The trader with the highest combined ticket price had 173 for sale with a total asking price of \u00a379,719 (including booking fees and delivery). While the CMA\u2019s court order calls for traders\u2019 full contact information to be advertised, entries for the trader\u2019s tickets simply listed his details as \u201cDublin\u201d. The highest number of tickets for sale by an individual trader was under the name of an Eileen Green, who listed 290 tickets with a combined price of \u00a364,704. Another prolific seller, a company called Tick Tock Ltd that listed its address as Panama City, had 100 tickets the combined cost of which stood at \u00a345,981. Another trader, Candy &amp; Co, gave a postbox address in Texas, while a fifth, Tyne and Wear Ltd, is based in Newcastle. The most expensive tickets, for sale by a trader listed as \u201charry tout\u201d carried a total cost of \u00a34,772 for two seats in the fourth row with a view of the tryline for the sold-out match between Scotland and Ireland at Murrayfield on 9 February. The tickets were marked as \u201cResale not allowed\u201d. Despite the CMA\u2019s court order, which demands that traders give their genuine contact details, the address for \u201charry tout\u201d was given as the Scottish newspaper the Daily Record, which has campaigned virulently against ticket touting. The Daily Record said it had no involvement with the listing. None of the traders could be reached for comment. A spokesman for the Rugby Football Union said the use of secondary market websites to resell tickets is prohibited by the RFU\u2019s ticket terms and conditions and that ticket holders known to have breached the terms and conditions would be refused entry. \u201cWhere tickets are resold on secondary market websites \u2013 especially at inflated prices \u2013 it is not just the genuine fans, but the wider game, whom suffer.\u201d The Irish Rugby Football Union urged fans not to buy resold tickets, which they said might be cancelled. The Welsh Rugby Union also warned fans against buying from ticket resale companies, warning that buyers risked ejection from the ground. This stance does not appear to dissuade traders. Touts have 194 tickets for sale for Scotland vIreland alone with a combined ticket price of \u00a357,758 which, if sold, will prove the most lucrative game of the tournament for traders. Traders are selling 223 tickets for sale for the Scotland v Wales match on 9 March with a combined value of \u00a349,318. When contacted, Viagogo said it was \u201cperfectly legal\u201d to resell tickets and that any bought through its website were valid and should not result in fans being turned away. A spokesperson said: \u201cEvent organisers sometimes make claims that they will deny entry to people who have purchased resold tickets. These types of entry restrictions are highly unfair and in our view, unenforceable and illegal. \u201cTherefore, as with all tickets on our platform, Viagogo customers should feel confident that they will gain entry to the event, and that is why we back every ticket with the Viagogo guarantee.\u201d Under the terms of the CMA\u2019s court order secured against the company, Viagogo has been obliged to publish not just names of touts but also more detailed information about what consumers are buying, such as seat number at the venue. But the Guardian found dozens of cases that did not display the seat number. Tom Watson, the shadow secretary for digital, culture, media and sport and deputy Labour leader, said it was \u201cdisgraceful to see that ticket touts on Viagogo are still ripping off rugby fans\u201d. \u201cViagogo has been told time and again that it needs to clean up its act. They are flagrantly disobeying the law and even ignoring a court order. It\u2019s unacceptable that consumers may not be able to see basic details about their tickets, like the seller\u2019s name and the seat number. Secondary ticketing platforms have been taking advantage of loyal fans for far too long. This has got to change.\u201d In late January the CMA, which had given Viagogo until mid-January to overhaul its business practices, said the changes made by Viagogo after the court order were \u201cinsufficient\u201d. Viagogo, in turn, issued a statement which simply said: \u201cWe are compliant.\u201d Methodology The Guardian analysed all listings for Six Nations tickets listed on the Viagogo website which carried a \u201cTrader\u201d logo on two consecutive days. The analysis covers 1,007 unique tickets on sale on the Viagogo website on Wednesday 30 January plus 148 unique tickets which subsequently came up for sale on Thursday 31 January. Checks were carried out to ensure no duplicate tickets were recorded by manually checking the ticket details, price and trader. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 February 2019 to remove an incorrect personal name.",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May is to return to Brussels on Thursday seeking fresh concessions despite the EU\u2019s insistence that the bloc will not renegotiate the Brexit deal. The prime minister will meet Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president on Thursday morning, and Donald Tusk, the president of the European council in the early afternoon. May is expected to formally seek the reopening of the withdrawal agreement on the back of the passing of the so-called Brady amendment last week calling for \u201calternative arrangements\u201d to replace the contentious Irish backstop. May told her cabinet ministers on Tuesday the objective was to find a legally binding way to ensure the UK could not be trapped indefinitely in the backstop, through one of three options: alternative technological arrangements, a time-limit or a unilateral exit mechanism. \u201cFollowing the vote, work has been taking place on all of the options and it is important for that to take place before we go to Brussels,\u201d her spokesman said. Downing Street is considering whether May would present just one or a number of possible options when she meets Juncker, although for now all three remain in play. It is possible that May will make a decision as to her preferred option by Thursday, insiders said, but a more likely scenario is that all three will form part of the negotiations as the summit meetings take place. The UK expects that the prime minister\u2019s request in person to reopen the withdrawal agreement will not be met warmly on Thursday, but the hope is that serious negotiations will follow thereafter in an attempt to resolve the Brexit impasse. Downing Street would not say if work by Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, with Conservative backbenchers on alternative arrangements would conclude on Wednesday, or whether the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, would have finished his attempt to draw up legally binding limits to the backstop. May\u2019s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, was in Brussels overnight, ahead of the prime minister\u2019s visit, meeting \u201ca combination of European politicians and officials\u201d, according to No 10. The PM\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cThe point we are at at the moment is that work is ongoing urgently on all three proposals. The PM has set out very clearly in the house what she believes will be required.\u201d No 10 added that the prime minister was \u201cdetermined to do what it takes to get the changes required to support the UK leaving the EU with a deal\u201d. In Belfast on Wednesday, May will meet representatives from the UUP, Alliance, SDLP, DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in, and the leader of the Northern Ireland Conservatives. May will then return on the UK but not in time for prime minister\u2019s questions, which will instead be taken by her de facto deputy, David Lidington. May will travel to Brussels on Thursday, where it is also understood that she will hold talks with the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, following her 11am meeting with the commission president. No other ministers are expected to travel with her. May will also meet the European council president, Donald Tusk, on Thursday. Tusk is expected to offer his solidarity with the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, during a press conference on Wednesday, following their meeting in Brussels. During a meeting with a group of MPs on Monday, Juncker\u2019s aide Martin Selmayr said a formal request for a renegotiation had yet to be tabled by Downing Street. Selmayr, the European commission\u2019s secretary-general, ruled out reopening the withdrawal agreement. But he asked the cross-party delegation from the select committee for exiting the EU if they would support the deal if an additional legal assurance on the temporary nature of the backstop was made. The Brexiters in the visiting group were unable to offer a clear response, leading to Selmayr tweeting later that he was reassured that the EU had been right to start its no-deal preparations in 2017. Selmayr also denied MPs\u2019 claims that his comments amounted to an offer of a legal adjunct to the withdrawal agreement. On Tuesday, the commission\u2019s chief spokesman said a press officer had been in the room taking notes as \u201cthis was a meeting that would be likely to be misrepresented\u201d. He said: \u201cI can tell you that I am very well informed that what you have read in the secretary-general\u2019s tweet is exactly what happened.\u201d Brexiters want the Irish backstop, which foresees the UK staying in a customs union to avoid a hard Irish border should there be no alternative, to be removed from the withdrawal agreement, or amended to be limited in time. The EU\u2019s leaders insist the backstop is necessary to avoid any possibility of a hard border and a breakdown in the Irish peace process. Asked if the EU expected new proposals from May, the commission spokesman declined to speculate: \u201cFor us, as you know, the backstop, which is part of the withdrawal agreement, is the central piece, is of fundamental importance.\u201d",

If Twitter were to implement the feature, Dorsey says the platform would most likely allow a \u201c5- to 30-second delay\u201d for a tweet to send in order for the edit to be made, so as not to lose the \u201creal-time nature\u201d of tweeting.</p> <p>Part of the appeal of an edit option is that users know the pain of a tweet becoming very popular \u2013 perhaps even going viral \u2013 and then spotting a glaring typo. In this instance, an edit button becomes a very attractive prospect. It also wouldn\u2019t be unprecedented on social media: both Facebook and Instagram (owned by Facebook) allow corrections to be made with statuses and captions after the content has gone live.</p> <p>But in the era of fake news, is an edit button really such a good idea? It would probably also prove inefficient, in the face of screen grabs. The Conservative MP Nadine Dorries, for instance, deleted a tweet yesterday in which she <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-47120879\" title=\"\">confused two British Asian women</a>, but that makes little difference when a jpeg can be shared instead. Dorsey also mentions that he would ensure that the original tweet was still accessible (which is good, because users wouldn\u2019t be able to deny their original statements \u2013 helpful in the case of aforementioned fake news and also rife abuse).</p> <p>Still, Dorsey has had two years to introduce the feature since he asked his question about what users most wanted \u2013 and has already introduced the other features that users requested (such as bookmarks and a mute function). Perhaps Dorsey will make a final decision on his next Myanmar retreat. He probably wishes he could edit his <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46498876\" title=\"\">much-criticised tweets about that</a>.</p>",

If Twitter were to implement the feature, Dorsey says the platform would most likely allow a \u201c5- to 30-second delay\u201d for a tweet to send in order for the edit to be made, so as not to lose the \u201creal-time nature\u201d of tweeting. Part of the appeal of an edit option is that users know the pain of a tweet becoming very popular \u2013 perhaps even going viral \u2013 and then spotting a glaring typo. In this instance, an edit button becomes a very attractive prospect. It also wouldn\u2019t be unprecedented on social media: both Facebook and Instagram (owned by Facebook) allow corrections to be made with statuses and captions after the content has gone live. But in the era of fake news, is an edit button really such a good idea? It would probably also prove inefficient, in the face of screen grabs. The Conservative MP Nadine Dorries, for instance, deleted a tweet yesterday in which she confused two British Asian women, but that makes little difference when a jpeg can be shared instead. Dorsey also mentions that he would ensure that the original tweet was still accessible (which is good, because users wouldn\u2019t be able to deny their original statements \u2013 helpful in the case of aforementioned fake news and also rife abuse). Still, Dorsey has had two years to introduce the feature since he asked his question about what users most wanted \u2013 and has already introduced the other features that users requested (such as bookmarks and a mute function). Perhaps Dorsey will make a final decision on his next Myanmar retreat. He probably wishes he could edit his much-criticised tweets about that.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>IT\u2019S TOUGH AT THE TOP</strong></h2> <p>When Liverpool took just one point from the three available against Leicester last week, their more optimistic fans fell over themselves in the rush to view what others might consider a setback as a huge positive. Manchester City had somehow lost against Newcastle the night before, after all, which meant J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side were still five points clear and that was still one hell of a cushion. Having seen City swat Arsenal aside over the weekend, Liverpool had the chance to restore the gap against West Ham, but were again forced to settle for a point. While undeniably better than the no points they almost certainly deserved, this particular one has not been welcomed quite as effusively by supporters who had to sit through another performance that was more nervous than a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs.</p> <p>\u201cThe questions won\u2019t go away and the only way they can answer them is on the pitch, but they are still three points in front,\u201d said Jamie Carragher after the game, in his Sky Sports role as Scouser eager to accentuate the positives. Saying he had faith in the experienced Klopp to calm dressing-room nerves and steady the ship, Carragher appeared to overlook that the German\u2019s nerves seem so frazzled that he blamed a match official\u2019s error that went in his own team\u2019s favour for Liverpool\u2019s inability to win. \u201cWe had good moments, coming through the channels and scored the goal, which I\u2019ve now been told is offside,\u201d tooted Klopp. \u201cThis explains a little bit the second half, because I think the referee knew at half-time. He knew it for sure at half-time, and then you saw a lot of strange situations. They were not decisive but just rhythm-breakers. That obviously didn\u2019t help us. There were so many situations where it was 50-50 or 60-40 \u2026 [he gave a] free-kick for the other team.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/05/tension-top-liverpool-creaking-defence-west-ham-premier-league\">Tension at the top starts to bite Liverpool\u2019s creaking defence | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps as baffled as the rest of us by a manager appearing to moan about match officials gifting his team a goal, the FA has asked Klopp to provide written observations over his comments and may well fine him if it decides he was accusing Friend of being deliberately biased in favour of West Ham by being accidentally biased in favour of Liverpool. It\u2019s a philosophical conundrum that could have the blazers at FA HQ scratching their syrups in bewilderment but in the meantime there\u2019s a fascinating title race to be run. With City facing Everton on Wednesday, Liverpool find themselves in the degrading position of having to root for the team that currently passes for their city rivals.</p> <p>\u201cGoodison Park is always a tough game for us but the approach is the same - going there to try to win the game and, of course, we have the chance, because Liverpool don\u2019t play, to go top of the league,\u201d parped Pep, whose team can go top on goal difference if they can riff on the pain currently being endured by Everton. \u201cWhat I\u2019m more concerned about is to never forget who we are as a team. That\u2019s what I want to watch every single day. After we will see about the results, how the table is.\u201d In a title race generating more knee-jerking than a Riverdance chorus line, the idea of simply enjoying this soap opera as it counts down to its natural conclusion seems far too sane.</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Barry Glendenning from 7.45pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of the FA Cup fourth-round replays</a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cWell, there is no better way to invest than doing it in art, culture and creation\u201d \u2013 Sergio Ramos explains why he has a giant statue of former Exeter City director Michael Jackson in his bathroom.</p> <h2>RECOMMENDED LISTENING</h2> <p>Here\u2019s the latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2019/feb/04/super-son-manchester-city-the-wsl-and-more-football-weekly\">Football Weekly podcast</a>.</p> <h2>RECOMMENDED LOOKING</h2> <p>David Squires on \u2026 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/feb/05/david-squires-on-everton-annual-crisis-and-celebrity-cats\">Everton\u2019s annual crisis and celebrity cats</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54365e997a314dfe82354bfd63dbf6781e037370\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54365e997a314dfe82354bfd63dbf6781e037370/1266_325_892_535/500.jpg\" alt=\"Miaow!\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miaow!</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: David Squires/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>SUPPORT THE GUARDIAN</h2> <p>Producing the Guardian\u2019s thoughtful, in-depth journalism [the stuff not normally found in this email, obviously \u2013 Fiver Ed] is expensive, but supporting us isn\u2019t.

Shame he\u2019s still based in South America, or he\u2019d really be Mr Worldwide. And finally, the King of Pop himself: Adriano Michael Jackson, who plays in South Korea!

      "bodyText": "IT\u2019S TOUGH AT THE TOP When Liverpool took just one point from the three available against Leicester last week, their more optimistic fans fell over themselves in the rush to view what others might consider a setback as a huge positive. Manchester City had somehow lost against Newcastle the night before, after all, which meant J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side were still five points clear and that was still one hell of a cushion. Having seen City swat Arsenal aside over the weekend, Liverpool had the chance to restore the gap against West Ham, but were again forced to settle for a point. While undeniably better than the no points they almost certainly deserved, this particular one has not been welcomed quite as effusively by supporters who had to sit through another performance that was more nervous than a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs. \u201cThe questions won\u2019t go away and the only way they can answer them is on the pitch, but they are still three points in front,\u201d said Jamie Carragher after the game, in his Sky Sports role as Scouser eager to accentuate the positives. Saying he had faith in the experienced Klopp to calm dressing-room nerves and steady the ship, Carragher appeared to overlook that the German\u2019s nerves seem so frazzled that he blamed a match official\u2019s error that went in his own team\u2019s favour for Liverpool\u2019s inability to win. \u201cWe had good moments, coming through the channels and scored the goal, which I\u2019ve now been told is offside,\u201d tooted Klopp. \u201cThis explains a little bit the second half, because I think the referee knew at half-time. He knew it for sure at half-time, and then you saw a lot of strange situations. They were not decisive but just rhythm-breakers. That obviously didn\u2019t help us. There were so many situations where it was 50-50 or 60-40 \u2026 [he gave a] free-kick for the other team.\u201d Perhaps as baffled as the rest of us by a manager appearing to moan about match officials gifting his team a goal, the FA has asked Klopp to provide written observations over his comments and may well fine him if it decides he was accusing Friend of being deliberately biased in favour of West Ham by being accidentally biased in favour of Liverpool. It\u2019s a philosophical conundrum that could have the blazers at FA HQ scratching their syrups in bewilderment but in the meantime there\u2019s a fascinating title race to be run. With City facing Everton on Wednesday, Liverpool find themselves in the degrading position of having to root for the team that currently passes for their city rivals. \u201cGoodison Park is always a tough game for us but the approach is the same - going there to try to win the game and, of course, we have the chance, because Liverpool don\u2019t play, to go top of the league,\u201d parped Pep, whose team can go top on goal difference if they can riff on the pain currently being endured by Everton. \u201cWhat I\u2019m more concerned about is to never forget who we are as a team. That\u2019s what I want to watch every single day. After we will see about the results, how the table is.\u201d In a title race generating more knee-jerking than a Riverdance chorus line, the idea of simply enjoying this soap opera as it counts down to its natural conclusion seems far too sane.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cIn response to Nathan Eaton, I\u2019m glad to say I have a few footballers with pop star names (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters). And a lot of them are South American. John Lennon, who plays left-back for Cruzeiro, is an obvious standout. Claudio Mejolaro, simply called Pitbull is one to mention as well. Shame he\u2019s still based in South America, or he\u2019d really be Mr Worldwide. And finally, the King of Pop himself: Adriano Michael Jackson, who plays in South Korea! He does the moonwalk when he scores as well\u201d \u2013 Akshay Kulkarni. \u201cBurnley once had a player called Paul Weller and I might have imagined a \u2018Weller gets Burnley out of jam\u2019 headline, but I can\u2019t recall imagining any Style Council-related headlines\u201d \u2013 Frankie Dodds. \u201cHow about Girona goalkeeper Bono and Middlesbrough midfielder Adam Clayton?\u201d \u2013Peter Oh. \u201cThere\u2019s Chris Martin of Derby County, who is currently on loan at Hull City.

Steggall is aiming to secure a primary vote of 50%. \u201cEveryone would have said that being a ski champion from Manly was impossible, and that was possible, so nothing is ever impossible,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge mountain to hope to climb, but you\u2019ve got to set the goal high, and if the current level of dissatisfaction is high enough, that\u2019s how people can really make their voice heard.\u201d Steggall\u2019s campaign is implicitly negative, centred on a time\u2019s up push against Abbott, but she said she wanted to keep her messages positive. She wanted to win, she said, \u201cwith the positivity of the message\u201d. She said it was obvious that in Australia negative campaigning cut through with the public, but she said \u201cthat\u2019s something we have to address\u201d. The ceaseless negativity of intraday politics was fuelling disengagement with institutions, including representative democracy, and the conversation \u201cinfiltrates the mood of the nation\u201d. \u201cYou have to be offering up some hope, as corny as that sounds,\u201d she said. She was also the recipient of help locally from Liberals concerned that if Abbott held the seat but the Coalition ultimately lost the election, he would want to take back the party leadership. \u201cI\u2019ve got a huge support base from moderate Liberals who feel incredibly disenfranchised. Something has to change,\u201d Steggall said.",

      "bodyText": "Extreme weather events linked to climate change have the potential to disrupt Australia\u2019s summer sports obsession at elite and grassroots level, the Climate Council warns. Its latest report \u2013 Weather Gone Wild, released on Wednesday \u2013 says climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of events such as extreme heat, intense rainfall, droughts, tropical cyclones and bushfires. It comes amid unprecedented flooding in north Queensland and out of control bushfires in Tasmania. Australia had its third warmest year on record in 2018 and the mean temperature was up by 1.14C, the report said. The report noted that parts of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and eastern South Australia were affected by drought and annual rainfall was 11% below average. It paints a snapshot of Australia\u2019s extreme weather events in 2018 such as cyclone Marcus\u2019s landfall over the Northern Territory in March which was the strongest to hit Darwin since cyclone Tracey in 1974. December\u2019s severe storms in Sydney and the NSW central coast that brought golf ball-sized hail and were the most expensive event for insurance companies in 2018. The council\u2019s Lesley Hughes said Australia\u2019s beloved summer sports calendar \u2013 which includes the popular Big Bash cricket series, AFLW games, the Tour Down Under cycling race, the Australian Open tennis and A-League football \u2013 could face potential disruptions in the future. \u201cI do think that as climate change continues to bite over the next few decades, sporting bodies are going to have to look at changing the timing of events that are commonly held in summer,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the big international events, it\u2019s kids\u2019 sporting events as well.\u201d Temperature records were broken around the globe in 2018. January was New Zealand\u2019s hottest month on record, and 3.1C above the national average from 1981-2010. Europe had its hottest April in 2018 since records began in 1910. The US experienced its hottest May since record-keeping began in 1895 but more recently has been in the grip of the polar vortex. The Macquarie University professor said that during the last drought community ovals and sports grounds became so dry they were deemed too dangerous for children to play on. The Australian Open brought in a new extreme heat policy in 2019 following complaints in previous years about player welfare. Matches have been called off and the roof has been closed because of high temperatures. Hughes said Australians would have to make dramatic changes to work life too which impacted on productivity. \u201cYou can\u2019t really work safely outside if it\u2019s 47C,\u201d she said. State governments are also going to have to ramp up resources to firefighting services. Previously Australia used to share firefighting equipment with places like California because the seasons were different but now they are overlapping. \u201cThe really expensive water-dumping aircraft are leased in the northern hemisphere during one season and the southern hemisphere during the other season,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cNow there\u2019s quite a lot of competition to get those aircraft.\u201d The window for hazard reduction in cooler months is getting smaller, Hughes said. She said some rainforests in Queensland that had never burnt before are drying out and being ravaged by fire. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing things we haven\u2019t experienced before.\u201d She pointed to Tasmania\u2019s hottest and driest January ever: 2.5C above average. \u201cYou\u2019ve got massive destruction of commercial forests in Tasmania, huge health impacts of smoke, really significant stress on communities,\u201d she said. On Tuesday the prime minister, Scott Morrison, toured flood-ravaged Townsville but declined to say much about climate change. \u201cI\u2019m not engaging in broader policy debates today. I\u2019m engaging in the needs of people here on the ground, people in evacuation centres,\u201d he said. Hughes said politicians needed to wake up. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of facing the facts, accepting the science and actually forming a climate policy,\u201d Hughes said. FAST FACTS The past four years have been the hottest on record for global surface temperature. Nine of the 10 hottest years on record in Australia have occurred since 2005. There were 12 times more hot temperature records than cold temperature records in Australia between 2000 to 2014. Rainfall has declined by around 11% in south-east Australia since the late 1990s. The atmosphere contains more energy than 50 years ago which means more extreme weather events. Insurance companies in Australia paid out more than $1.2bn in claims last year.

      "bodyText": "HMV has been rescued from collapse by a Canadian music entrepreneur, but 27 stores in prime locations have closed, including the site of its first store on London\u2019s Oxford Street. Doug Putman, who runs the Canadian retailer Sunrise Records, has bought the UK music and film chain after emerging as the leading contender over the weekend, heading off competition from Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct. Under the deal, 100 HMV shops will remain open, protecting the jobs of nearly 1,500 workers across the stores and head office. However, the immediate closure of 27 stores will lead to 455 job losses. A further 122 warehouse jobs will go in the coming weeks. Closure of the flagship store on Oxford Street signals the end of HMV\u2019s presence on London\u2019s most famous shopping street after nearly a century. That first shop was opened in 1921 by Sir Edward Elgar, the British composer. HMV is also closing in other prime locations where rents are higher including the Trafford Centre in Manchester, Meadowhall in Sheffield, Westfield in White City, west London, and Bluewater shopping centre in Kent. The retailer collapsed into administration just after Christmas, blaming tough conditions on UK high streets and competition from streaming sites such as Netflix and Spotify. Sales of physical music, games and video products in the UK fell by 11.4% last year, led by a near 17% slide in sales of DVDs and other physical film formats. Announcing the deal, Putman said: \u201cWe are delighted to acquire the most iconic music and entertainment business in the UK and add nearly 1,500 employees to our growing team.\u201d Putman said he would personally lead the turnaround over the coming months. He told the Guardian he wanted to expand HMV and would be putting more vinyl records and more live music events into stores.

A film version of the thriller, about a woman with agoraphobia who begins spying on her new neighbours, is due out later this year, scripted by Pulitzer prize-winning playwright Tracy Letts and starring Amy Adams and Gary Oldman.</p> <p>However, the New Yorker article by Ian Parker lays out a history of Mallory fabricating stories of illness and death, including that he had been diagnosed with brain cancer. The article claims Mallory had repeatedly said he had cancer, including in an Oxford University application, and to colleagues while working at publishing houses in both London and New York.</p> <p>On Tuesday, several industry sources who asked to remain unidentified confirmed to the Guardian that Mallory had told them he had brain cancer while working at publisher Little, Brown in London between 2009 and 2012. One author published by Sphere, the crime imprint Mallory worked on, said that Mallory frequently spoke of having cancer and once told her that he had enjoyed reading one of her manuscripts multiple times, despite wearing an eyepatch due to losing sight in his eye after an operation on a brain tumour. The author said he never showed any evidence of being ill and that his \u201cmiraculous\u201d recovery had long been a talking point among those around him.</p> <p>A former colleague of Mallory\u2019s at Little, Brown also confirmed that the author had told the office that he had brain cancer as an explanation for long periods out of the office. They began to suspect it was untrue after receiving emails from someone claiming to be Mallory\u2019s brother Jake, detailing his illness. Mallory denied to the New Yorker that he was the author of those emails.</p> <p>The New Yorker also alleges repeated instances of Mallory lying about his professional abilities, asserting during his job interview at Little, Brown that he had been an editor at US publisher Ballantine, when he had only been an assistant. Sources at Little, Brown told the Guardian that he later claimed to have received a job offer from a competitor, with Little, Brown offering him a pay increase to encourage him to stay. However, the competitor later told several figures at Little, Brown that it had never made an offer to Mallory and he was asked to leave. Mallory subsequently became vice president and executive editor of US publisher William Morrow.</p> <p>In later years, Mallory reportedly told authors and employers that he had a PhD from Oxford, but the university confirmed that while he did complete his master\u2019s degree there in 2004, Mallory never submitted a doctoral thesis.</p> <p>Though the New Yorker confirmed that his parents and three siblings are all alive, it claimed Mallory had told people in publishing that his mother had died of cancer and his brother had killed himself. And in his college entrance application to start his doctorate at New College, Oxford, Mallory wrote that his entire family was dead as an explanation for his grades while completing his master\u2019s degree. Craig Raine, former professor of English literature at New College, said that Mallory had written the essay as fact, and of having had a brain tumour in the past that \u201csort of cleared up\u201d.</p> <p>In a statement responding to the New Yorker article, Mallory confirmed he had never had cancer, saying he had used the illness to disguise his struggles with bipolar disorder: \u201cIt is the case that on numerous occasions in the past, I have stated, implied, or allowed others to believe that I was afflicted with a physical malady instead of a psychological one: cancer, specifically. My mother battled aggressive breast cancer starting when I was a teenager; it was the formative experience of my adolescent life, synonymous with pain and panic. I felt intensely ashamed of my psychological struggles \u2013 they were my scariest, most sensitive secret. And for 15 years, even as I worked with psychotherapists, I was utterly terrified of what people would think of me if they knew \u2013 that they\u2019d conclude I was defective in a way that I should be able to correct, or, worse still, that they wouldn\u2019t believe me. Dissembling seemed the easier path.\u201d</p> <p>He added that \u201clike many afflicted with severe bipolar II disorder, I experienced crushing depressions, delusional thoughts, morbid obsessions, and memory problems. It\u2019s been horrific, not least because, in my distress, I did or said or believed things I would never ordinarily say, or do, or believe \u2013 things of which, in many instances, I have absolutely no recollection.\u201d</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/14/crime-fiction-daniel-mallory-woman-in-the-window-debut-interview\">a 2018 interview in the Observer</a>, Mallory alluded to one such period, saying that depression had \u201cforced him into periods of debilitating absence\u201d while working for Sphere. However, he stated that new medication had made him well after he began working at William Morrow.</p>",

Each visitor will be charged \u20ac3 (\u00a32.65), a cost that will rise to between \u20ac6 and \u20ac10, depending on the time of year, from 1 January 2020. The charge is expected to be added to the cost of arriving in the city by either train, cruise ship, bus or plane.</p> <p>Brugnaro said that from 2022 visitors would also have to \u201creserve access\u201d to the city, but did not explain how the measure would be applied. He added that while people would not be denied access, entering would be \u201cmore complicated\u201d for those who failed to reserve a spot.</p> <p>The initiatives are intended to control tourist numbers in a city that attracts about 30 million visitors a year.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about how much we cash in,\u201d Brugnaro, who is also a League member, said. \u201cIt\u2019s about managing the tourist flow \u2026 we don\u2019t want Venice to become a theme park.\u201d</p> <p>The arrival charge will not affect those who have booked hotel rooms. Venice visitors already pay a tourist tax if they spend at least one night in the city.</p> <p>The Italian parliament gave authorities in Venice the go-ahead to implement the charge in late December.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Centinaio said the minister had always been against such measures, despite the collective backing from the government. \u201cHe didn\u2019t raise his hand but he has always had the same line regarding Venice, that he is against any type of measure that \u2018blocks\u2019, such as a tax or gates.\u201d</p> <p>Brugnaro described the approach as \u201csoft\u201d, adding that it was a way to \u201cshow the world that Venice is a \u2018slow\u2019 city and must be respected\u201d. He previously said money collected from the charge would help fund the cleaning up of rubbish that day-trippers leave behind and be invested in programmes that \u201craise decorum\u201d.</p>",

The charge is expected to be added to the cost of arriving in the city by either train, cruise ship, bus or plane. Brugnaro said that from 2022 visitors would also have to \u201creserve access\u201d to the city, but did not explain how the measure would be applied. He added that while people would not be denied access, entering would be \u201cmore complicated\u201d for those who failed to reserve a spot. The initiatives are intended to control tourist numbers in a city that attracts about 30 million visitors a year. \u201cIt\u2019s not about how much we cash in,\u201d Brugnaro, who is also a League member, said. \u201cIt\u2019s about managing the tourist flow \u2026 we don\u2019t want Venice to become a theme park.\u201d The arrival charge will not affect those who have booked hotel rooms. Venice visitors already pay a tourist tax if they spend at least one night in the city. The Italian parliament gave authorities in Venice the go-ahead to implement the charge in late December. A spokesperson for Centinaio said the minister had always been against such measures, despite the collective backing from the government. \u201cHe didn\u2019t raise his hand but he has always had the same line regarding Venice, that he is against any type of measure that \u2018blocks\u2019, such as a tax or gates.\u201d Brugnaro described the approach as \u201csoft\u201d, adding that it was a way to \u201cshow the world that Venice is a \u2018slow\u2019 city and must be respected\u201d. He previously said money collected from the charge would help fund the cleaning up of rubbish that day-trippers leave behind and be invested in programmes that \u201craise decorum\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The daughter of the Holby City actor John Michie died after taking drugs given to her by her boyfriend at a music festival as he filmed her last moments, a court has heard. Louella Fletcher-Michie\u2019s boyfriend, Ceon Broughton, 29, gave her the class A party drug 2C-P at Bestival, in Dorset, in September last year, it is alleged, causing her to die an hour before her 25th birthday. Her parents rushed to the site after telephoning Broughton as Fletcher-Michie overdosed and hearing her \u201cscreeching\u201d, Winchester crown court was told. Broughton, of Enfield, north London, denies manslaughter and supplying Fletcher-Michie the drug. William Mousley QC, prosecuting, said Broughton failed to get help because he had been given a suspended jail term one month earlier and feared the consequences. \u201cShe died as a result of having taken a large dose \u2013 later described by the defendant as an overdose \u2013 of a class A drug known colloquially as 2C-P, which he had given her at a music festival,\u201d he said. \u201cIt had a terrible effect upon her, leading to her death after a significant period of suffering in woods close to the festival site, all of which he must have observed.\u201d Jurors were told Broughton filmed Louella, a dancer and yoga teacher, as her condition deteriorated. In clips shown to the court, she repeatedly shouts at Broughton to telephone her mother, Carol, but he tells her to \u201cput your phone away\u201d. Mousley said: \u201cHe filmed her when she was disturbed, agitated, and then seriously ill over a period of hours. He even did so, the prosecution suggest, after she was apparently dead.\u201d Fletcher-Michie\u2019s mother eventually spoke to her at 6.48pm and grew concerned after she \u201ccould hear her screeching\u201d. The couple dropped everything to travel from north London to Dorset. Fletcher-Michie\u2019s brother Sam also contacted Broughton and urged him to seek medical help. But Broughton sent him a message which said \u201ccall back in an hour\u201d and referred to his girlfriend as a \u201cdrama queen\u201d, the jury heard. Jurors were told Sam also knew Broughton and had been given 2C-P by him previously. He asked Broughton if his sister had taken 2C-P, and Broughton replied: \u201cYeah, but I bumped it up a bit.\u201d Mousley said Fletcher-Michie\u2019s brother interpreted that to mean that Broughton had given her \u201ceither a larger dose or a combination of it with other drugs\u201d. A postmortem examination found \u201c2C-P toxicity\u201d and traces of ketamine and MDMA, the court heard. Mousley said Prof Charles Deakin, a medical expert, \u201cdidn\u2019t believe that Louella\u2019s death was inevitable if she had received medical help\u201d. Deakin found there was a 90% chance of survival with early intervention. Mousley said that a month before the incident, Broughton was given a 24-week prison sentence suspended for one year. \u201cHis failure to get her treatment which may well have saved her life was borne of selfishness and in self-preservation. \u201cBecause to have done otherwise, to have acted positively, he knew would have exposed him to the possibility of arrest and prosecution for a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment.\u201d The court was told that Fletcher-Michie occasionally used \u201cparty drugs\u201d, including 2C-P and MDMA, and had tried to take pills into Bestival but had them confiscated by security on arrival. She told Broughton, who travelled to the event separately, about the confiscation and he replied \u201cthat he would bring some\u201d, jurors heard. Defending Broughton, Stephen Kamlish QC said his client and and Fletcher-Michie \u201cwere in love with each other\u201d and \u201csoulmates\u201d. He said: \u201cYou will hear from experts that no one has ever been known to die from taking this drug [2C-P] or taking an overdose.\u201d Kamlish claimed that Fletcher-Michie had acquired the 2C-P herself, adding: \u201cThis is not gross negligence manslaughter.\u201d The trial continues.",

      "bodyText": "The Hatton Garden jewellery heist suspect known as Basil was linked to the crime by his \u201cabnormal\u201d walk, a court has heard. Michael Seed, 58, is alleged to have been a key player in the 2015 burglary and is accused of disabling an alarm system at a safety deposit facility in the Hatton Garden jewellery quarter of London. Philip Evans QC, prosecuting, told Woolwich crown court on Tuesday there was a consistency between Seed\u2019s walk and that of the suspect captured on CCTV footage. Seed and Danny Jones, 63, squeezed through a 25cm by 45cm hole, a replica of which was shown to jurors, to steal an estimated \u00a313.7m in gold, money and precious stones from 73 boxes, the court heard. Investigators who searched Seed\u2019s home in Islington, north London, found jewellery belonging to victims of the burglary, smelting machines, electronic devices that could be used to disable alarms, and manuals on anti-surveillance, the court was told. They also found Royal Mail and BT uniforms, which the prosecution said Seed could have used to gain access to closed-off locations. The suspect alleged to be Seed was wearing a red wig, a blue boiler suit and had his face covered while carrying a black bin bag when he walked through the main entrance of 88-90 Hatton Garden on the Thursday before Easter. He then opened a fire exit from the inside to allow other burglars to enter. Evans said Seed was the final participant in the burglary \u2013 having had a leading role alongside Jones, John \u201cKenny\u201d Collins, Terry Perkins and Brian Reader \u2013 and he was primarily responsible for the disabling of the alarm system. In recordings of conversations which were played to the court, the other burglars can be heard referring to Basil\u2019s frugal lifestyle and his willingness despite a lack of physical strength. In the aftermath of the heist, the court heard, Seed met Collins, 78, twice in Shoreditch Park. CCTV footage of the suspect has been seen by an expert chiropodist who concluded that it was consistent with someone with an \u201cabnormal gait\u201d and that it was consistent with Seed\u2019s walk, Evans said. A total of 1,015 items of jewellery, precious or semi-precious stones were found in a bedroom at Seed\u2019s home, the majority of which were found in self-sealed bags but also in plastic containers. Some jewellery found in a wardrobe appeared to have been deconstructed in preparation for smelting. Seed is also alleged to have taken part in a raid on the Chatila jewellery store in Bond Street, London, in which \u00a31 worth of jewellery and \u00a345m in cash was stolen. The court heard that Seed, who has been unemployed since 2009, has no source of income and does not receive benefits. Since 2010, he has deposited just over \u00a312,600 into his personal bank account. Seed denies two charges of conspiracy to commit burglary and one charge of conspiracy to convert or transfer criminal property. The trial continues.",

      "bodyText": "A man has been arrested after death threats were allegedly made towards Labour MP Yvette Cooper. The 59-year-old was detained by West Yorkshire police on Friday. Detectives said the man from Leeds was arrested in Castleford and has since been bailed. A Labour Party member, who did not wish to be named, said several police officers had been present at a constituency party meeting on Friday evening as a precaution. Those attending the meeting in Airedale were asked to show their membership cards to officers as they arrived, he said. Cooper received a threat against the lives of her family in June 2016, shortly after the murder of MP Jo Cox. The former cabinet minister, MP for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford, received the threat via her Twitter account. It accused her of sending pro-EU \u201cpropaganda\u201d, adding: \u201cPlease stop or I will kill your kids and grandkids.\u201d The threat followed the murder of Cox, the Labour MP for Batley and Spen, by Thomas Mair, a week before the EU referendum vote. Mair was jailed for the rest of his life after an Old Bailey trial that heard he was obsessed with Nazism and ideas of white supremacy. In regards to the alleged threat against Cooper, West Yorkshire police said: \u201cAs a result of information received in relation to alleged threats against a serving MP, officers arrested a 59-year-old Leeds man in Castleford on Friday. \u201cHe has been bailed pending further advice from the Crown Prosecution Service.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The winner: How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World No film opened at UK cinemas above \u00a33.5m in January, but now the first of the year\u2019s blockbusters has arrived: How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World. The final film in the DreamWorks Animation trilogy kicked off with \u00a35.32m from 556 venues. The first film took \u00a34.85m (including \u00a32.12m in previews) in April 2010, while the second earned \u00a37.78m (including \u00a34.86m in previews) for the first week of wide release in July 2014. Final totals for the two films were \u00a317.4m and \u00a325.5m. Because of DreamWorks Animation\u2019s fluctuating distribution arrangements over the years, the three films have come out via different studios: Paramount, 20th Century Fox and Universal. The latter will be aiming to demonstrate that it can top the achievements of earlier partners. The runner-up: Green Book The latest best picture Oscar nominee to land is Green Book, starring Viggo Mortensen as a nightclub bouncer hired to drive an African American pianist (Mahershala Ali) on a tour of the deep south in the pre-civil rights era. The film is a seeming crowdpleaser \u2013 it won the people\u2019s choice award at the Toronto international film festival, for example \u2013 but the US box office has been underwhelming, with $56m (\u00a343.1m) after 12 weeks of release. Green Book arrives in UK cinemas that are already packed with awards-baiting titles including Mary Queen of Scots, Vice, Stan &amp; Ollie and The Favourite, so distributor eOne should be happy with a debut of \u00a31.23m (\u00a31.67m including previews) and will be hoping to sustain it in the UK market through to the 24 February Oscars ceremony and beyond. More awards-season competition arrived at the weekend with Can You Ever Forgive Me?, starring Oscar and Bafta nominees Melissa McCarthy and Richard E Grant. The true tale of a forger of literary letters has begun with an OK \u00a3416,000 from 256 cinemas (\u00a3518,000 including previews). The weather factor Widespread snow on Friday seemed to affect the box office, especially for films with an older audience skew. Green Book, Vice, Can You Ever Forgive Me? and Stan &amp; Ollie all did substantially better on Sunday than two days earlier. Conversely, high-concept thriller Escape Room \u2013 which has earned comparisons with Final Destination and Saw \u2013 did better on Friday than Sunday. Genre titles traditionally play well to a younger Friday-night crowd. UK opening for Escape Room is \u00a3820,000 including previews. More might have been expected, since there\u2019s not much else in the marketplace for this audience, unless you count M Night Shyamalan\u2019s Glass. The market Official data for January shows an alarming shortfall on 2018, with box office 18% down on a year ago. There was a confluence of factors: no big family film (a year ago we had Coco), no The Greatest Showman (which delivered more than \u00a315m in January 2018), and the awards titles this time are not quite as commercially potent. A year ago, a big Disney film (Star Wars: The Last Jedi) and a big family film (Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle), both released in December, delivered a combined \u00a330m in January. This time around, Mary Poppins Returns has added just shy of \u00a320m since the end of December. February has begun more encouragingly, with the first weekend down just 7% on the equivalent session from 2018. Hopes are now pinned on the James Cameron-produced Alita: Battle Angel arriving on Wednesday, and this weekend\u2019s The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part. More awards season titles arrive this week in the shape of All Is True (starring Kenneth Branagh as Shakespeare), If Beale Street Could Talk (from Moonlight director Barry Jenkins) and Boy Erased (starring Lucas Hedges, Nicole Kidman, Joel Edgerton and Russell Crowe). The distributors of all three face tough challenges securing the best indie cinemas, which are already gridlocked with a range of more richly nominated titles.

      "bodyText": "Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has issued a thinly veiled threat to the young opposition leader trying to force him from power, hinting that Juan Guaid\u00f3 could soon be imprisoned as a result of his challenge. Addressing a meeting of supporters on Monday night, Maduro questioned how long Guaid\u00f3 \u2013 who declared himself Venezuela\u2019s rightful interim president on 23 January \u2013 would persist with his \u201cvirtual term\u201d. \u201cUntil 2025, too?\u201d Maduro said, referring to the six-year term he recently assumed to a storm of international condemnation. \u201cOr until he ends up in jail by order of the supreme court of justice.\u201d Western diplomats have expressed surprise that, nearly two weeks after he threw the gauntlet down to the incumbent leader, Guaid\u00f3 remained a free man. Many attributed that fact to warnings from his key backer, the United States, that any move against him would have consequences. Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton, has said that violence against or intimidation of Guaid\u00f3 or other opposition leaders \u201cwould represent a grave assault on the rule of law and will be met with a significant response\u201d. Venezuelan state media have intensified their campaign against Guaid\u00f3 and his growing list of international backers in recent days, claiming that they risked plunging the country into war. On Monday, a succession of European governments, including Britain, France, Germany, Portugal and Spain, recognised Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate leader after Maduro rebuffed their call for presidential elections. During an interview on Tuesday morning on the state-run channel Venezolana de Televisi\u00f3n, the Socialist party politician Gerardo S\u00e1nchez said \u201csqualid\u201d and traitorous members of the opposition would be treated \u201clike enemies of the homeland\u201d if their actions sparked foreign military intervention. Speaking on Monday night, Maduro again railed against \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s extremist policies\u201d towards Venezuela and gave no hint he was preparing to stand aside. Maduro also condemned US-backed plans to send convoys of humanitarian aid to Venezuela\u2019s western and southern borders later this week as a provocation designed to humiliate his country and his government. \u201cWith this show of humanitarian aid they are trying to send a message: \u2018Venezuela has to go begging to the world!\u2019 And Venezuela will not beg for anything from anyone in this world,\u201d he said. Some observers fear that the aid convoys risk sparking \u2013 or may even be designed to spark \u2013 a confrontation with Venezuelan troops loyal to Maduro. On Monday, Guaid\u00f3 urged members of the military to allow the aid into his economically-collapsed country. In C\u00facuta, the busiest crossing on Colombia\u2019s 1,378-mile (2,219 km) border with Venezuela, warehouses were filled with boxes of aid which began to arrive on Sunday evening. Photos shared on social media on Saturday by Mark Green, the head of USAid, showed boxes of food being prepared for delivery, emblazoned with a US flag. Though it is not yet known how the aid will be delivered to Venezuela, Colombian officials with knowledge of the process said it was an operation lead by Guaid\u00f3 from Caracas in coordination with US aid workers and regional governments. On Monday, Canada pledged $40m (\u00a331m) of aid destined for Venezuela, while the US last week promised $20m.",

A research project she started when she was 13 for science class led to the development of <a href=\"http://www.rethinkwords.com/whatisrethink\">ReThink</a>, an app designed to stop cyberbullying by detecting offensive messages and encouraging users to reconsider their (potentially angry and emotionally-charged) posts before pressing send. She then embarked on what she describes as the \u201cworld\u2019s biggest juggling act\u201d by developing the app at the same time as completing high school.</p> <p>Her motivation for the feat came from reading an article about the death of a 12-year-old girl who had taken her own life after being bullied online. \u201cIt broke my heart to think that we\u2019ve reached a place where that kind of hate is acceptable, where people feel they can say anything online,\u201d says Prabhu, who had also been cyberbullied herself.</p> <p>Since patenting the technology and launching the app at the age of 15, it has garnered a huge amount of attention and has been used by 2.5 million students and 1,500 schools internationally. Importantly, teachers feeding back to her credit the app with helping to reduce bullying among pupils.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"eca177bd49038a846639f03d093d22fec8061123\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eca177bd49038a846639f03d093d22fec8061123/0_0_400_400/400.jpg\" alt=\"Trisha Prabhu, founder, ReThink; an app designed to prevent online bullying.\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trisha Prabhu, founder, ReThink; an app designed to prevent online bullying.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Trisha Prabhua</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like many of her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/21/generation-z-has-different-attitudes-says-a-new-report\">Generation Z peers</a>, Prabhu wants to continue to do good in the world as part of her future career, as well as put her formidable digital skills to use. But what world awaits her? In the US, data from 2017 showed that female founders received just <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/01/31/female-founders-venture-capital-2017/\">2%</a> of the venture capital funding that year and big tech companies are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/01/google-walkout-global-protests-employees-sexual-harassment-scandals\">still facing allegations</a> of sexual harassment.</p> <p>Prabhu credits a supportive environment at school as a key factor in her success: \u201cI had lots of people around me who believed in what I was doing.\u201d But when it comes to work, she\u2019s not sure of what will happen. \u201cYou do look at Silicon Valley and think: \u2018Why would I want to work there?\u2019 There aren\u2019t many people who look like me, as a woman of colour, there are harassment allegations, and often there isn\u2019t an environment that\u2019s respectful of women\u2019s needs. Many companies don\u2019t have policies like maternity leave, for example, or have women in leadership.\u201d</p> <p>Coding camps, hackathons and mentoring opportunities for girls and young women interested in tech have become more numerous in the UK in the past few years (see for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2018/oct/04/get-dot-to-do-a-phd-stemettes-co-founder-wants-eastenders-to-lead-women-into-tech\">Stemettes</a> or <a href=\"https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/\">Code First: Girls</a>) that try to foster a supportive environment.</p> <p>Elena Sinel, an educator who runs tech events and hackathons for teens with her organisation, Acorn Aspirations, says she has no problem attracting girls to her events, where they\u2019ll work with industry mentors to learn about entrepreneurship and practise developing machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI).</p> <p>But UK statistics suggest any enthusiasm drummed up among girls is yet to be replicated in the professional world. In 2017, just <a href=\"https://www.recruitment-international.co.uk/blog/2017/08/only-17-percent-of-employees-in-uk-tech-sector-are-women-research-reveals\">17% of roles</a> in the UK tech industry were occupied by women, according to research by a recruiter, and last year a report by Inclusive Boards found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/14/worrying-lack-of-diversity-in-britains-technology-sector-race-gender-report-finds\">40%</a> of tech companies have no representation of women in senior roles at all. Meanwhile, research from the Female Founders Forum revealed that startups with at least one female founder attracted just <a href=\"https://www.home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/news/2017/Untapped-Unicorns-Scaling-up-Female-Entrepreneurship-2017.pdf\">9% of the cash</a> (pdf) invested in UK startups in 2017.</p> <p>\u201cI think a lot of teenage girls are worried about the gender balance. They worry they might be doubted more,\u201d says Sara Conejo, 17, from London. She recently led a team to create and publish a new skill for Alexa, called Optimus Maths, while attending an Alexa bootcamp. She\u2019s now studying and is part of the <a href=\"https://teensinai.com/\">TeensinAI</a> network.</p> <p>\u201cMaking sure that you have a work culture where women feel safe is really important,\u201d Conejo says.

      "bodyText": "Trisha Prabhu, an 18-year-old entrepreneur and computing student at Harvard University, shot to recognition at a young age. A research project she started when she was 13 for science class led to the development of ReThink, an app designed to stop cyberbullying by detecting offensive messages and encouraging users to reconsider their (potentially angry and emotionally-charged) posts before pressing send. She then embarked on what she describes as the \u201cworld\u2019s biggest juggling act\u201d by developing the app at the same time as completing high school. Her motivation for the feat came from reading an article about the death of a 12-year-old girl who had taken her own life after being bullied online. \u201cIt broke my heart to think that we\u2019ve reached a place where that kind of hate is acceptable, where people feel they can say anything online,\u201d says Prabhu, who had also been cyberbullied herself. Since patenting the technology and launching the app at the age of 15, it has garnered a huge amount of attention and has been used by 2.5 million students and 1,500 schools internationally. Importantly, teachers feeding back to her credit the app with helping to reduce bullying among pupils. Like many of her Generation Z peers, Prabhu wants to continue to do good in the world as part of her future career, as well as put her formidable digital skills to use. But what world awaits her? In the US, data from 2017 showed that female founders received just 2% of the venture capital funding that year and big tech companies are still facing allegations of sexual harassment. Prabhu credits a supportive environment at school as a key factor in her success: \u201cI had lots of people around me who believed in what I was doing.\u201d But when it comes to work, she\u2019s not sure of what will happen. \u201cYou do look at Silicon Valley and think: \u2018Why would I want to work there?\u2019 There aren\u2019t many people who look like me, as a woman of colour, there are harassment allegations, and often there isn\u2019t an environment that\u2019s respectful of women\u2019s needs. Many companies don\u2019t have policies like maternity leave, for example, or have women in leadership.\u201d Coding camps, hackathons and mentoring opportunities for girls and young women interested in tech have become more numerous in the UK in the past few years (see for example, Stemettes or Code First: Girls) that try to foster a supportive environment. Elena Sinel, an educator who runs tech events and hackathons for teens with her organisation, Acorn Aspirations, says she has no problem attracting girls to her events, where they\u2019ll work with industry mentors to learn about entrepreneurship and practise developing machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). But UK statistics suggest any enthusiasm drummed up among girls is yet to be replicated in the professional world. In 2017, just 17% of roles in the UK tech industry were occupied by women, according to research by a recruiter, and last year a report by Inclusive Boards found that 40% of tech companies have no representation of women in senior roles at all. Meanwhile, research from the Female Founders Forum revealed that startups with at least one female founder attracted just 9% of the cash (pdf) invested in UK startups in 2017. \u201cI think a lot of teenage girls are worried about the gender balance. They worry they might be doubted more,\u201d says Sara Conejo, 17, from London. She recently led a team to create and publish a new skill for Alexa, called Optimus Maths, while attending an Alexa bootcamp. She\u2019s now studying and is part of the TeensinAI network. \u201cMaking sure that you have a work culture where women feel safe is really important,\u201d Conejo says. She\u2019s also worried that without input from women and minorities the AI technology being created now will replicate the biases that already exist in society. \u201cWe need to make sure we\u2019re looking at ethics in AI and that it is able to produce outputs that aren\u2019t gender biased. Continuing to use biased data sets will start to cause big problems in future.\u201d Lowenna Hull, 16, from Portsmouth, successfully created an MP3 player with a Raspberry Pi computer, for use on the International Space Station, as part of a science competition when she was 13.

A culture that only celebrates wins, Prabhu says, rather than trying and failing, can discourage women: \u201cToo often we have cultures where if anyone gets something wrong, especially if it\u2019s a woman and they are in the minority and perhaps don\u2019t look like they belong there, she might be dismissed.\u201d Prabhu has been a teacher with US mentoring organisation Girls Who Code for a few years and is encouraged by the work they do.

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap: Britain\u2019s services sector slowed to the brink of stagnation last month. Markit\u2019s monthly service sector PMI dropped to just 50.1%, showing barely any growth at all. Services bosses reported that they\u2019ve been forced to cut headcount, after suffering weakening new business. Many blamed Brexit uncertainty for spooking clients. Economists fear that the UK could struggle to post any meaningful growth this quarter, given that construction firms and manufacturers also found January tough. In another sign of economic anxiety, UK car sales have fallen by 1.6% in January - although electric vehicle sales rose. The picture isn\u2019t any better overseas. The eurozone private sector is growing at the slowest rate since mid-2013, with France and Italy particularly weak. Growth in Ireland also slowed, while even Australia is feeling the chill. Despite this gloom, European stock markets have risen steadily today as traders put their recent worries behind them (for the moment, anyway....) And HMV staff have been learning whether jobs are safe, or not, after Canada\u2019s Sunrise Records saved most of the company from collapse.. Just in: Activist investor Edward Bramson has submitted an application to become a board member of Barclays -- in what should be a popcorn moment for the City. In a brief statement, Bramson\u2019s investment company Sherborne Investors says: The board of Sherborne Investors (Guernsey) C Limited has been informed by the Investment Manager that Sherborne Investors Management LP submitted, yesterday, an ordinary resolution to Barclays PLC to be considered at Barclays\u2019 Annual General Meeting, which is expected to be held on 2 May 2019, for the purpose of appointing Mr. Edward Bramson to the board of directors of Barclays. Bramson, who owns a 5% stake in Barclays, has been agitating for months for a change of strategy - arguing that it should focus more on consumer banking, not investment banking. Last summer, Sherborne also revealed it had been discussing finding a chairman to replace John McFarlane; he might not welcome seeing Bramson over the boardroom table.... The City has shrugged off the deluge of disappointing data. The FTSE 100 is still on track to hit a three-month closing high, up currently up 88 points at 7,122. Oil giant BP is still the top riser, up 4.2%, after reporting it doubled its profits last year. Online grocery business Ocado is also having a good day, up 2.5% after predicting more revenue and earnings growth next year. However, news of a fire at its robot-operated distribution centre this morning has worried traders a little. European stock markets are also up around 0.8%, even though eurozone services companies also struggled to grow last month. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: In stark contrast to Monday\u2019s torpid trading, the European markets let rip on Tuesday, bounding higher despite some worrisome data out of the region. Led by BP, the FTSE shot up more than 100 points as the day went on, striking 7130-plus levels last seen in early November. This as sterling fell a further 0.3% against the dollar, taking it to a 2 week low that\u2019s perilously close to $1.30, and 0.2% against the euro as the services PMI, which came in at a comatose 50.1, completed a hat-trick of Brexit-burdened data out of the UK. Like the FTSE, the Eurozone indices were in a hell of a good mood. The DAX triumphantly returned to last week\u2019s 11300 highs following a 150 point surge, while the CAC tickled 5050 after its own 1.2% climb. There\u2019s lots of media reaction to today\u2019s weak service sector data . Delphine Strauss of the Financial Times says the slowdown shows that Brexit is biting. Growth in the UK services sector nearly ground to a halt in the first month of the year, with political uncertainty leading clients to delay decisions on new projects and hold off placing orders. Over at The Times, Miles Costello flags up that services firms are now cutting jobs, for the first time since 2012. Britain\u2019s dominant services sector came to a virtual standstill last month as companies began to cut staff numbers for the first time in six years, according to a closely watched survey that has hit the value of the pound. The latest snapshot index on services compiled by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply generated a reading of 50.1 in January, down from 51.2 in December and perilously close to the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. Bloomberg\u2019s Jill Ward says the UK economy is now at risk of stalling: The report follows disappointing Markit surveys on manufacturing and construction for January and comes just days before the Bank of England publishes its latest policy decision on Feb. 7. The central bank, which has long warned of the damage from Brexit to investment, will also publish new forecasts for growth and inflation. The services report showed that new business volumes declined for the first time in 2 1/2 years, employment fell and optimism in the sector was close to the lowest levels in a decade. Asif Abdullah, analyst at Scotiabank, is also concerned by the services slowdown: Chris Giles of the Financial Times makes a good point, though -- a weak PMI report doesn\u2019t always lead to a downturn (it crashed after the Brexit vote, before rebounding). Today\u2019s survey of the UK service sector is \u201cseriously disappointing\u201d, says Howard Archer of the EY Item Club. He says: The services PMI pointed to the sector essentially stagnating in January as it was at the weakest level since July 2016 (which was in the immediate aftermath of the UK\u2019s referendum vote to leave the EU) and at the second lowest level since December 2012. Subdued business and consumer spending weighed on services activity in January. Heightened Brexit uncertainty was reported to be affecting clients\u2019 business investment decisions. Archer\u2019s also worried that new business fell last month, suggesting activity will be weak in the near term (at least). That could mean that growth this quarter will be very weak, or even non-existent. The pound has hit a two-week low, as traders respond to the worrying slowdown in UK company growth last month. Sterling has lost a third of a cent against the US dollar this morning, down to $1.30, Sam Cooper, Vice President of Market Risk Solutions at Silicon Valley Bank, says Brexit worries and economic anxiety are both pulling the pound down: \u201cToday\u2019s weak reading adds to the downward pressure currently exerted on sterling as fears of an economic slowdown in the face of Brexit uncertainty begin to surface. While the data will feed some short-term volatility to the pound, focus will remain on Westminster as the main engine behind long term sterling strength as Brexit plays out.\u201d James Knightley of ING fears that Britain\u2019s economy could actually be contracting. Having inspected January\u2019s PMI report, he says: The UK\u2019s purchasing managers indicator surveys suggests that the economy is stagnating as we approach Brexit day. With no deal in sight, business and consumer caution will only intensify, risking a 1Q contraction. Knightley blames political uncertainty around Brexit for the slump - it\u2019s deterring companies and individuals from placing new orders. He explains: Worryingly, the employment component also dropped into contraction territory and business optimism is near decade lows. It is clear that business is worried and with the Brexit uncertainty set to continue, the risk is that activity softens further - firms will become increasingly risk averse and implement contingency Brexit planning. With all sectors of the UK economy now feeling pain, it is imperative the government and the House of Commons get a grip on Brexit. Meanwhile, the case for a Bank of England rate hike this year continues to recede. Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says January was a bleak month for services companies. \u201cThe sector had the January blues last month, as employment dropped for the first time in over six years, and new order levels fell into contraction territory. \u201cAt the risk of sounding like a broken record, Brexit uncertainty continues to be at the heart of the malaise as clients delayed orders and consumers were deeply reluctant to spend under the continuing cloud of hesitation, indecision and ambiguity. \u201cStaff in employment were demanding higher wages which impacted on input price inflation rising again, so there was little respite on offer. \u201cAs optimism levels remained at some of the lowest levels since the last recession in 2009, the vice-like grip of Brexit is now taking hold of the sector, making it a very difficult start to the year and leaving little hope for improvement next month.\u201d Today\u2019s PMI report is based on interviews with purchasing managers across the UK. They tell Markit how their company is faring - whether sales are up or down, how the order book is looking, and whether they\u2019ve taken on staff or laid them off. Those findings are turned into an index, showing if activity rose, fell, or was unchanged. So its \u2018soft data\u2019, rather than an official GDP report. But as this chart shows, the PMI is often a good measure of growth. And right now, it\u2019s sounding the alarm bells for the UK economy.... January\u2019s PMI surveys suggest that the UK economy could be stalling, or even worse, says Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. He blames Brexit uncertainty, and the wider slowdown in the global economy [as we\u2019ve already seen in France, Italy, Ireland and Australia today] Williamson fears the UK economy may not post any growth at all in the current quarter: \u201cService sector growth ground almost to a halt in January, matching similar disappointing news in the manufacturing and construction sectors. The last three months have seen the economy slip into its weakest growth spell for six years, and indicate that GDP likely stagnated at the start of 2019 after eking out modest growth of just 0.1% in the fourth quarter. \u201cWith the exception of July 2016, when demand contracted briefly following the surprise Brexit vote, service providers suffered the largest drop in new business since April 2009 as customers tightened their belts. \u201cService sector employment fell for the first time in the past six years in a sign that the slowdown is feeding through to the labour market. \u201cThe survey results indicate that companies are becoming increasingly risk averse and eager to reduce overheads in the face of weakened customer demand and rising political uncertainty. Such worries were in turn most commonly linked to heightened Brexit anxiety, though wider global political and economic factors were also seen to have been taking their toll on demand.\u201d We learned last week that UK manufacturing growth hit a three-month low in January. Yesterday, we saw that construction output had hit a 10-month low. And now we know that the services sector, which makes up three-quarters of the economy, barely grew at all. Add it together, and you can see that the UK economy is flatlining: Unpromising is an understatement.... NEWSFLASH: Britain\u2019s dominant service sector has fallen to the brink of stagnation. Data firm Markit has reported that growth fizzled out last month, with new orders decline for the first time in two-and-a-half years. Companies reported that they were forced to cut staff numbers, for the first time in over six years. This dragged Markit\u2019s service sector PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, down to just 50.1 - the lowest reading in two and a half years. It\u2019s another clear sign that Brexit uncertainty is hurting the economy. Markit says: Survey respondents overwhelmingly linked the slowdown in business activity growth to heightened political uncertainty at the start of 2019. A number of service providers reported that Brexit-related concerns had dampened client demand and resulted in delayed decision making on new projects More to follow... Back in the UK, car sales have suffered another decline. Car registrations fell by 1.6% year-on-year in January, to 161,013 units. That\u2019s a weak start to 2019, following two years of falling sales. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, who compile the numbers, say private buyers bought more cars, while business and fleet registrations fell. Demand for greener cars jumped too, with sales of electric, plug-in hybrid and hybrid cars up 26.3% year on year (but they\u2019re still under 7% of the total market). Se\u00e1n Kemple, Director of Sales at Close Brothers Motor Finance, says Brexit uncertainty is hurting the auto sector. \u201cThese figures, and recent news from Nissan in Sunderland, highlight the damaging effect of uncertainty on the industry. The entire sector is screaming out for a resolution, with all eyes on Parliament in the hope of some clarity on the way forward. Until we have this, the current scene is set to stay. \u201cHowever, once we have a new way forward on this issue, there remain other issues that will continue to exist from consumer confusion around fuel type to a global market slowdown. During this period, the opportunity is there for dealers to demonstrate their expertise and reassurance to customers. This will be key in bolstering bottom lines over the coming months. Having the right stock is vital, and the right after-sales support will support bottom lines as we begin a cold winter\u201d France could soon be on the brink of recession, Markit fears: Despite worries about a recession, Germany is outperforming its major eurozone neighbours, points out Emanuele Canegrati of BPPrime. Newsflash: Eurozone private sector growth has hit its weakest level since mid-2013. The monthly euro area PMI survey, which tracks activity across the economy, has come in at just 51.0 for January. That\u2019s barely above stagnation. Data firm Markit, which conducts the survey, reports that France and Italy were particularly weak, with growth contracting in both countries. Output in France was down for a second successive month, and at the fastest rate in over four years. Meanwhile, Italian private sector output deteriorated for the third time in four months and to the greatest degree in over five years. Manufacturing was the primary source of output weakness during January. Whilst service sector growth was unchanged since December at around a four-year low, production in manufacturing rose only slightly and at the weakest rate in over five- and-a-half years of growth. The service sector PMI, just released, came in at 51.2 - matching December\u2019s 49-month low. Any reading above 50 shows growth, while a figure below 50 means a contraction. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says the eurozone economy may struggle to post any growth this quarter: \u201cThe eurozone has started 2019 on flat note, with growth close to stagnation amid falling demand for goods and services. The PMI indicates that GDP is growing at a quarterly rate of just 0.1%, setting the scene for the region\u2019s worst quarter since 2013. Such a weak start to the year would mean the current consensus forecast for 1.5% GDP growth in 2019 is likely to be revised lower, and hence lead to more dovish signals from the ECB. \u201cWhat started as a manufacturing and export-led slowdown has shown increasing signs of infecting the service sector. The manufacturing PMI numbers are indicative of the goods-producing sector slipping into recession, while growth in services is now running at its lowest for four years. Worst may be yet to come: new orders received by factories are declining at the steepest rate for nearly six years and new business inflows into the service sector have stalled. Demand is consequently falling to an extent not seen since mid-2013. Despite all the gloom swirling this morning, European stock markets are rallying. The FTSE 100 has jumped by 60 points, or 0.85%, to 07,095 points, extending its recent rally. That\u2019s a two-month high, and on track for its highest close in three months. BP is the top riser, after posting a surge in profits this morning. Mining companies such as Glencore and Antofagasta are also among the risers. Things are looking bad for Italy: More bad news - France\u2019s services sector also shrank last month (any PMI reading below 50 shows a contraction). Oof! Italy\u2019s services sector contracted last month, according to the latest survey of purchasing managers. Data firm Markit reports that Italian services companies cut jobs, after suffering weaker new order growth and a drop in new business from abroad. That\u2019s bad news, with Italy already in recession. Japan has defied the worries about the services sector, by posting faster growth last month. However, a weak manufacturing performance has provided something else to worry about: In a rare piece of (mostly) good retail news, most of music chain HMV has been rescued from collapse. Canadian firm Sunrise Records has swooped on HMV, which fell into administration a month ago. The deal saves around 1,500 jobs, and 100 stores. Doug Putman, chief executive of Sunrise Records, believes HMV can have a bright future, despite the crisis on the high street and the rise of streaming music services. He\u2019s been on the Today Programme, raving about the attractions of vinyl (something you can\u2019t get straight off Spotify). However, not everyone can celebrate; 27 stores are shutting, with the loss of 455 jobs. Ireland\u2019s services sector has also entered a trough. Growth has now weakened for four months running, hitting its lowest rate since May 2013 in January. AIB, which conducts the survey, found that new orders weakened last month, while output growth also hit its lowest in over five years. Having recovered strongly since the financial crisis, Ireland may now be feeling the impact of geopolitical problems, such as the US-China trade wars and Brexit worries. Oliver Mangan, AIB Chief Economist, says: The January AIB Services PMI signals a somewhat slower start to 2019 for the economy, after the robust rate of expansion recorded in the past number of years. It suggests that growth in the Irish economy is likely to slow this year, which is hardly surprising given the loss of momentum in the global economy in recent times. Commonweath Bank of Australia says its regular survey of Australian services activity has dropped to its lowest point since the survey started in May 2016. It warns: The Australian service sector shifted down a gear at the start of the year as a slower upturn in new work weighed on business activity. Steady international demand supported the expansion, but domestic markets slowed. Hiring growth also eased. However, optimism in the year ahead was sustained while backlogs accumulated at a solid pace. Inflationary pressures meanwhile moderated noticeably at the beginning of 2019. Ryan Felsman, Senior Economist at stockbroking firm CommSec, says this can now be added to the growing \u2018wall of worry\u2019 for investors and policymakers. While month-to-month outcomes can be volatile, particularly over the Christmas/New Year period, falling new orders and sales suggest that the weakening domestic and global economic backdrop are weighing on confidence and activity. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A splurge of data from services companies around the globe today are likely to confirm that the world economy stumbled into 2019. Economists predict that Britain\u2019s service sector only managed modest growth last month, while the eurozone is expected to have remained close to stagnation. New data from Australia overnight shows that its service sector had a bad month: Ireland also started 2019 badly, with service sector growth at its weakest since May 2013. A poor set of data from Europe today would fuel concerns that its economy is faltering - just days after Italy fell into recession. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: Last week\u2019s manufacturing PMI\u2019s showed little sign of a pickup in January, apart from a decent number from Spain, and today\u2019s services numbers might well be similarly disappointing. We already had a sneak preview of the French and German numbers at the end of last month and the French numbers were particularly awful, disrupted to some extent by the \u201cgilet jaunes\u201d protests, coming in at 47.5, almost a 5-year low, and down from 49 in December, having cratered from 55.1 in November. In Italy the services sector is expected to have stagnated in January, coming in at 50, and in the process inviting further scrutiny of the Italian governments growth expectations, which continue to look spectacularly heroic, as well as being even more unachievable as each day passes. It can only be a matter of time before the market refocuses its attention on the likelihood of the Italian government running back into conflict with the EU about its fiscal plans. In the City, oil producer BP has posted a 65% surge in profits for the last quarter - thanks to the jump in crude prices of late. Online supermarket chain Ocado, though, has posted a 21% drop in earnings - as it keeps splashing cash on investment and partnership deals. European markets are expected to maintain their recent rally, with the FTSE 100 heading for a new two-month high.

Refugee detainees were ousted from some detention centres and made to move weapons or pack bullets. In September, Haftom was one of hundreds of refugees and migrants transported to a detention centre in Zintan, far outside the capital, ostensibly because it was more secure. At least eight people have died at that centre since mid-September, according to detainees. One was a five- or six-year-old boy who died from appendicitis because he didn\u2019t get the necessary medical care. \u201cIt is hard to talk about this life. I am also losing hope. Please share this to the world and tell [them] our problems before many lives [are] gone,\u201d an Eritrean still imprisoned there messaged me this week. Though friends believed Haftom developed a heart problem, it wasn\u2019t clear what the final cause of his death was. \u201cSo many people [are] getting ill,\u201d messaged his fellow detainee. \u201cThey take them and [put] them in one house and they don\u2019t give them any medication.\u201d The Eritrean also said Haftom knew he had reached the end. \u201cEveryone in here [thinks that] if he gets sick. No one is thinking that they are going to be OK. They are thinking only it\u2019s our turn.\u201d \u2022 Sally Hayden is a journalist focusing on migration and humanitarian crises",

      "body": "<p>Mother Teresa\u2019s face appears on a white sphere floating above the pulpit of the Union Chapel. Her mouth starts moving as she tells us, in a high-pitched American accent, the story of a dream in which she was in a train crash and then felt sorry for beavers who had been skinned for their fur. Below, the musicians of the Residents look up reverentially at the projection. Three of their number wear checked suits and white bowler hats, faces hidden behind oversized bird beaks and goggles. The singer, Randy, is dressed as a cow, complete with horns and a snout.</p> <p>The Residents have disguised their identities since they emerged from the wreckage of the American hippy movement of the late 60s, rarely communicating with the media and then only via a spokesman called Homer Flynn. Even without the outfits, their bewildering back catalogue is one of wild conceptuality. It includes mangling the Beatles\u2019 Hey Jude on Third Reich &amp; Roll, a record that satirised the commercial music industry by reimagining it as a Hitlerian endeavour, and Commercial Album, which, with 40 songs all of one minute in length, was anything but. Theirs is an exploration of the American grotesque that arguably has more in common with David Lynch than any of their musical peers.</p> <p>Tonight, the strange menagerie on stage radically reworks tracks from across their history under the title In Between Dreams. It\u2019s an exploration of the suggestive subconscious, which, in the Residents\u2019 hands, can only mean nightmares. Despite the fact that this feels a more low-key production than recent tours, the stripped-back intensity in the chapel setting follows such a fine line between terrifying and unselfconsciously daft that the eeriness is heightened.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"92c4fd8979473eaeb5d341d374d5bc992e745b15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92c4fd8979473eaeb5d341d374d5bc992e745b15/0_0_7602_5156/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A fine line between terrifying and unselfconsciously daft\u2019 ... the Residents.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A fine line between terrifying and unselfconsciously daft\u2019 ... the Residents.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Venla Shalin/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In addition to the vision of Mother Teresa, the sphere above the altar flickers into life three more times with disembodied heads. We see John Wayne wistfully imagining a ballerina, Nixon dreaming that during Watergate he was a blues bandleader \u201cwith Kissinger on piano\u201d, and a clown who looks several shades of pale beyond the grave sorrowfully wishing he was a cowboy. Its ghoulish appearance is followed by The Black Behind, a track made of thunder and shrieking harmonica, like Dylan being sucked from a train into a plains tornado.</p> <p>The music interspersed around the dream vignettes is a cacophony of electronics, shredding electric guitar, and Randy\u2019s vocals. He has a uniquely unsettling ability to switch, in the space of a line, from the uncannily melodic tones of a tired and emotional vaudeville singer to a 50-a-day weirdo whose house you\u2019d tell the kids to avoid. Baby Sister ends in a bloodcurdling scream, yet a take on James Brown\u2019s It\u2019s a Man\u2019s, Man\u2019s, Man\u2019s World feels almost heartfelt in its bombastic rock pastiche.</p> <p>The Residents have always added a curious sense of soul to their subterfuge, even as they make a nightmare of the iconography of the American dream. Tonight, with ghostly apparitions, sound design and lyrics, is a fevered reel of the American west, showbiz, Hollywood, the circus, the railroad, and rock\u2019n\u2019roll. It\u2019s an excursion through the Residents\u2019 diabolical imagination that gives the lie to the notion that there\u2019s nothing more boring than other people\u2019s dreams. Penultimate number Tourniquet of Roses ends with the refrain \u201cthere is no more to say\u201d barking out of the speakers as, looking around furtively, the bovine Randy scampers off towards the vestry.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Mother Teresa\u2019s face appears on a white sphere floating above the pulpit of the Union Chapel. Her mouth starts moving as she tells us, in a high-pitched American accent, the story of a dream in which she was in a train crash and then felt sorry for beavers who had been skinned for their fur. Below, the musicians of the Residents look up reverentially at the projection. Three of their number wear checked suits and white bowler hats, faces hidden behind oversized bird beaks and goggles. The singer, Randy, is dressed as a cow, complete with horns and a snout. The Residents have disguised their identities since they emerged from the wreckage of the American hippy movement of the late 60s, rarely communicating with the media and then only via a spokesman called Homer Flynn. Even without the outfits, their bewildering back catalogue is one of wild conceptuality. It includes mangling the Beatles\u2019 Hey Jude on Third Reich &amp; Roll, a record that satirised the commercial music industry by reimagining it as a Hitlerian endeavour, and Commercial Album, which, with 40 songs all of one minute in length, was anything but. Theirs is an exploration of the American grotesque that arguably has more in common with David Lynch than any of their musical peers. Tonight, the strange menagerie on stage radically reworks tracks from across their history under the title In Between Dreams. It\u2019s an exploration of the suggestive subconscious, which, in the Residents\u2019 hands, can only mean nightmares. Despite the fact that this feels a more low-key production than recent tours, the stripped-back intensity in the chapel setting follows such a fine line between terrifying and unselfconsciously daft that the eeriness is heightened. In addition to the vision of Mother Teresa, the sphere above the altar flickers into life three more times with disembodied heads. We see John Wayne wistfully imagining a ballerina, Nixon dreaming that during Watergate he was a blues bandleader \u201cwith Kissinger on piano\u201d, and a clown who looks several shades of pale beyond the grave sorrowfully wishing he was a cowboy. Its ghoulish appearance is followed by The Black Behind, a track made of thunder and shrieking harmonica, like Dylan being sucked from a train into a plains tornado. The music interspersed around the dream vignettes is a cacophony of electronics, shredding electric guitar, and Randy\u2019s vocals. He has a uniquely unsettling ability to switch, in the space of a line, from the uncannily melodic tones of a tired and emotional vaudeville singer to a 50-a-day weirdo whose house you\u2019d tell the kids to avoid. Baby Sister ends in a bloodcurdling scream, yet a take on James Brown\u2019s It\u2019s a Man\u2019s, Man\u2019s, Man\u2019s World feels almost heartfelt in its bombastic rock pastiche. The Residents have always added a curious sense of soul to their subterfuge, even as they make a nightmare of the iconography of the American dream. Tonight, with ghostly apparitions, sound design and lyrics, is a fevered reel of the American west, showbiz, Hollywood, the circus, the railroad, and rock\u2019n\u2019roll. It\u2019s an excursion through the Residents\u2019 diabolical imagination that gives the lie to the notion that there\u2019s nothing more boring than other people\u2019s dreams. Penultimate number Tourniquet of Roses ends with the refrain \u201cthere is no more to say\u201d barking out of the speakers as, looking around furtively, the bovine Randy scampers off towards the vestry.",

      "bodyText": "The mother of Stephen Lawrence has said she has only ever found one police officer worthy of her trust in the last 26 years \u2013 and his bosses ousted him from his job. Doreen Lawrence was giving evidence to MPs on the home affairs committee who have been investigating what progress has been made in the 20 years since an official report exposed police prejudice. The Macpherson report in 1999 found that police blunders that had helped the killers of Stephen Lawrence escape justice were in part due to prejudice caused by institutional racism, with Lady Lawrence telling MPs on Tuesday that it \u201cstill exists\u201d, 20 years on. Stephen Lawrence was stabbed to death in April 1993 in south-east London by a gang of at least five white youths. Two, Gary Dobson and David Norris, were eventually convicted and jailed but others remain free. Lady Lawrence told MPs of her 26 years of experience of the police and said: \u201cThe only officer I really trusted, who got the two convictions, and they got rid of him, they made him retire when he did not want to.\u201d The officer was former DCI Clive Driscoll who led the murder hunt that resulted in the conviction of Dobson and Norris in 2012. The police vowed to change after the Macpherson report but some within their own ranks say not enough has been achieved. Lawrence said after her son was murdered police had failed the family: \u201cWe were treated like we were the criminals, not the victims.\u201d She said officers and young people lacked respect for each other. She had witnessed encounters on the street in which she felt police were heavy-handed. \u201cI still feel that police on the beat just don\u2019t get it. I would drive past, walk past, and I see one individual, a young black man, he\u2019d probably have about six officers around him. Do you need that intimidation, do you need that amount of officers? No, you don\u2019t.\u201d She said efforts to stamp out racism in society have stalled. \u201cIt does seem as if things have become stagnant.\u201d Lawrence said the top priorities should be education and teaching children \u201ctrue history\u201d, such as how they came to be in this country. She said there needs to be more focus on the police and \u201chow they police, because without consent they can\u2019t police the community\u201d. \u201cPeople \u2026 are still suffering from what we as a family went though back in 1993,\u201d said Lawrence. MPs also heard from black police officers who criticised the use of stop and search, rising as violent crime increases, and they also called for radical change. Tola Munro, president of the National Black Police Association, said the law should be changed to allow positive discrimination for a limited time. The scheme was used in Northern Ireland to get more Catholics into the police. Munro dismissed concerns that would lead to black officers being viewed as not up to the job by their white counterparts: \u201cWe get it anyway, you might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb.\u201d Sgt Janet Hills of the Metropolitan Black Police Association, said she had been stopped when off duty, and while working had been mistaken by colleagues for a prisoner, rather than the arresting officer. There are at least two active inquiries into the Lawrence case. In one the National Crime Agency is looking into claims that corruption also shielded the killers. The other is a judge-led inquiry into allegations that undercover officers spied on Lawrence and her family.

As a result he missed Birmingham\u2019s first game of the following season, but Jim Smith, their new manager, said the player had provided in return \u201ca firm assurance that he will stay with us, at least for the remaining two years of his contract\u201d.</p> <p>Smith meanwhile had made a promise of his own. \u201cHe said to me he knew that I\u2019d been looking to move on and play for a bigger club,\u201d Francis says. \u201cHe told me he was a manager with great ambition, that he wanted the team to do well and wanted me to do everything I could to help him on the field, but then after Christmas if things had not improved he would do anything possible to help me get away. It was so refreshing for me to have someone as honest as Jim Smith, who was clear with me and stuck to his word.\u201d</p> <p>Not only did Birmingham\u2019s fortunes fail to improve under Smith, they deteriorated significantly. By the start of February 1979 they had eight points, their chances of survival were extremely remote, and Smith made good on his promise. On 7 February they accepted an offer from Forest, with Coventry making clear they would happily match it. The following day Francis had a four-hour meeting with Clough and Peter Taylor at the City Ground, departing with a promise to inform them of his decision the following morning.</p> <p>\u201cThey were very keen and wanted me to make a decision there and then,\u201d Francis remembers. \u201cWhat they didn\u2019t realise is that I\u2019d made my mind up before I\u2019d even started negotiations, and after that meeting I was absolutely certain that what I wanted was to go to Forest. But out of respect for Coventry I felt I owed a phone call to their manager, Gordon Milne. I wanted him to be the first one to know what was going on.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4485fe13540c5b60c31b1dcbbaaadbbe201ac3f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4485fe13540c5b60c31b1dcbbaaadbbe201ac3f3/0_116_2192_1315/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trevor Francis heads the winning goal for Nottingham Forest in the 1979 European Cup final against Malm\u00f6.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trevor Francis heads the winning goal for Nottingham Forest in the 1979 European Cup final against Malm\u00f6.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Francis signed for Forest the following day, Clough turning up to his unveiling in a tracksuit, toting a squash racket. \u201cWe believe Trevor is the most exciting player in the country at this moment,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cTrevor is lucky he is joining Forest at their peak. If we mess this up we may as well emigrate.\u201d</p> <p>Forest had a good go at messing up the transfer. They failed to register their new player before he turned out in a third-team match against Notts County that weekend, in front of an estimated 40 people, which cost \u00a3250 in fines. A week later the necessary papers still hadn\u2019t turned up, further delaying his full debut. The following month, with Francis ineligible to play in the European Cup quarter-final against Grasshoppers Zurich, Forest allowed him to fly by Concorde to play for Detroit Express in a friendly against New York Cosmos (he scored six times in an 8-2 win) and jet back again. The Football Association felt such an outing required its permission, and launched another inquiry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Francis\u2019s time at Forest was repeatedly disrupted by injury but was famously crowned by the winning goal in the 1979 European Cup final, as well as crucial strikes in the quarter- and semi-finals as the club retained that title the following season. His place in football history, however, was already assured. \u201cI never realised at the time the significance of it,\u201d he says. \u201cI smashed, literally smashed, the transfer record. Doubled it. It was just a magical figure \u2013 a million pounds. Paris Saint-Germain spent nearly \u00a3200m on Neymar, but I don\u2019t think it has the same magical appeal that \u00a31m did. On Saturday I\u2019m going to be watching Plymouth against Portsmouth. I\u2019m not going to be marking the day with anything special. But do I feel proud of being the first \u00a31m player? Absolutely.\u201d</p>",

As a result he missed Birmingham\u2019s first game of the following season, but Jim Smith, their new manager, said the player had provided in return \u201ca firm assurance that he will stay with us, at least for the remaining two years of his contract\u201d. Smith meanwhile had made a promise of his own. \u201cHe said to me he knew that I\u2019d been looking to move on and play for a bigger club,\u201d Francis says. \u201cHe told me he was a manager with great ambition, that he wanted the team to do well and wanted me to do everything I could to help him on the field, but then after Christmas if things had not improved he would do anything possible to help me get away. It was so refreshing for me to have someone as honest as Jim Smith, who was clear with me and stuck to his word.\u201d Not only did Birmingham\u2019s fortunes fail to improve under Smith, they deteriorated significantly. By the start of February 1979 they had eight points, their chances of survival were extremely remote, and Smith made good on his promise. On 7 February they accepted an offer from Forest, with Coventry making clear they would happily match it. The following day Francis had a four-hour meeting with Clough and Peter Taylor at the City Ground, departing with a promise to inform them of his decision the following morning. \u201cThey were very keen and wanted me to make a decision there and then,\u201d Francis remembers. \u201cWhat they didn\u2019t realise is that I\u2019d made my mind up before I\u2019d even started negotiations, and after that meeting I was absolutely certain that what I wanted was to go to Forest. But out of respect for Coventry I felt I owed a phone call to their manager, Gordon Milne. I wanted him to be the first one to know what was going on.\u201d Francis signed for Forest the following day, Clough turning up to his unveiling in a tracksuit, toting a squash racket. \u201cWe believe Trevor is the most exciting player in the country at this moment,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cTrevor is lucky he is joining Forest at their peak. If we mess this up we may as well emigrate.\u201d Forest had a good go at messing up the transfer. They failed to register their new player before he turned out in a third-team match against Notts County that weekend, in front of an estimated 40 people, which cost \u00a3250 in fines. A week later the necessary papers still hadn\u2019t turned up, further delaying his full debut. The following month, with Francis ineligible to play in the European Cup quarter-final against Grasshoppers Zurich, Forest allowed him to fly by Concorde to play for Detroit Express in a friendly against New York Cosmos (he scored six times in an 8-2 win) and jet back again. The Football Association felt such an outing required its permission, and launched another inquiry. Francis\u2019s time at Forest was repeatedly disrupted by injury but was famously crowned by the winning goal in the 1979 European Cup final, as well as crucial strikes in the quarter- and semi-finals as the club retained that title the following season. His place in football history, however, was already assured. \u201cI never realised at the time the significance of it,\u201d he says. \u201cI smashed, literally smashed, the transfer record. Doubled it. It was just a magical figure \u2013 a million pounds. Paris Saint-Germain spent nearly \u00a3200m on Neymar, but I don\u2019t think it has the same magical appeal that \u00a31m did. On Saturday I\u2019m going to be watching Plymouth against Portsmouth. I\u2019m not going to be marking the day with anything special. But do I feel proud of being the first \u00a31m player? Absolutely.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It is quiet on Monday morning on Hulme High Street, south Manchester. It is not quite lunchtime and only a few shoppers are braving the February chill, though a blue sky threatens to raise spirits. The Spin is walking about in an anorak trying to discover if West Indies\u2019 thrilling win over England last weekend meant anything to the British African-Caribbean community which first started arriving in Hulme and Moss Side in the 1960s and has made it home (1.6 million Jamaicans \u2013 9% of the island\u2019s population left in the early 1960s \u2013 9% of those came to the UK, and 2% of those to Manchester). At Global African Ltd, a grocery shop, one of the customers, Josephine Jackson, heard about West Indies\u2019 win on the news. She is originally from the Seychelles but her late husband was from Jamaica and he loved the game. \u201cHe was a big player. We used to watch on the television all the time. I remember when Clive [Lloyd] and the other one, Viv Richards, played, but I don\u2019t see nothing much any more. I think the younger ones would watch it if they could, but how can they when it is all on satellite?\u201d Just over the road at Roy\u2019s Original Sweet Dish Takeaway the owner, Roy Hibbert, is preparing for the lunchtime rush. He\u2019s been working around this area for 20 years and loves cricket, in theory, though he has never been to a match in England. \u201cI used to play it after school in Jamaica on little empty streets, but I haven\u2019t really got time to follow it any more. But I think a West Indies win still uplifts us. I think cricket still means something to the global Caribbean community.\u201d Ricardo Williams, the 41-year-old owner of the barber Skye Kutz agrees. \u201cYes, it still means a lot. England are more organised with fewer arguments but West Indies still beat them.\u201d He came over to the UK as a young man from Jamaica in 2001. He watched and played cricket as a boy but not over here. \u201cIt\u2019s not the weather for it, it is too cold.\u201d He gets his sports updates from Upday via his phone, including news from the IPL. \u201cTest cricket is OK but it tests my patience. Nobody wants to be at the crease for four days. I like T20, I\u2019d love to see Chris Gayle play.\u201d Would he go to Old Trafford? \u201cIf West Indies were playing, I\u2019d go to see them.\u201d [They are, in the World Cup against New Zealand and India during June]. However, he admits that he doesn\u2019t know anyone younger than him who likes cricket. \u201cThe demographic who like cricket is late 40s and 50s or older.\u201d The Spin then loiters around the huge local Asda as students from the nearby Loreto College decamp for lunch, but can\u2019t find a single cricket fan among them. At the leisure centre, a friendly man at reception reports that none of the staff like cricket and the indoor cricket league that used to play there doesn\u2019t any more because, after a refurbishment, the floor in the main hall was no longer suitable. Further out of town in Whalley Range, a sewing group at the St John\u2019s Community Centre is busy making costumes for a pantomime. There\u2019s a problem with one of the sewing machines and Greta Shaw is not best pleased about her stitching being unpicked. Greta, 78, was born in Jamaica and came over to the UK in 1960. She followed the cricket on the radio last week. \u201cMyself and the coach driver had a good laugh on the way to EventCity talking about the cricket. I was pretty excited \u2013 and how about the poor man whose mother had died the night before he played? I used to go to Old Trafford when I was younger and I was on television once. It still means something to our community but the younger ones prefer basketball and football.\u201d She and her friend tell me to come back on a Wednesday afternoon, when the local elderly men gather. \u201cThey won\u2019t stop talking cricket the whole time.\u201d So there you are. A one-off vox pop, a few hours of walking the streets \u2013 lots of cultural affection for cricket among the older crowd but no one actively following it, no one with satellite television, no one playing it, no young fans. It is a tiny snapshot of a complicated picture, but African-Caribbean support for cricket in Britain has certainly dropped through the floor from the days when fans would flock to Old Trafford and the Oval with musical instruments and in joyous celebration to watch the great West Indies sides. A community lost to the game over the course of a generation \u2013 something the ECB is desperate not to happen to the South Asian diaspora. There is no African-Caribbean strategy to match the South Asian Action Plan launched by the ECB last summer, but it is hopeful that the changes recommended in that report, especially the building or restoring of urban cricket centres, will help all children living in the inner cities engage with cricket \u2013 black British, white working class, eastern European as well as South Asian.

A <a href=\"https://www.laingbuisson.com/blog/new-equity-offers-some-optimism-in-uk-market-amidst-growing-dentist-workforce-concerns-and-economic-uncertainty/\" title=\"\">new report</a> by market analysts LaingBuisson suggests that while the \u201chigh street\u201d dental sector as a whole remains robust, with forecast annual growth of 2%-2.5% over the next three years, this is down to expanding private care, particularly cosmetic treatments such as teeth whitening and straightening. The report\u2019s author, Philip Blackburn, says: \u201cAt the same time, NHS dentistry is falling behind and policy-makers face a clear challenge to ensure demand for NHS dentistry is being met across the UK.\u201d</p> <p>On LaingBuisson\u2019s figures, the overall UK dental market is worth \u00a37.1bn a year. For 2017-18, the period covered by the report, NHS market share is put at less than \u00a33.5bn. As patients pay almost \u00a31bn of that in NHS charges, this means that they are paying for nearly two-thirds of all non-hospital dentistry.</p> <p>The dental surgery Hancock visited is of course far from unusual in being closed to new NHS patients: the British Dental Association (BDA) says fewer than one in 10 practices in Hancock\u2019s West Suffolk constituency accepts adult NHS registrations, with just one in five registering children.</p> <p>Mydentist, the trading name of Manchester-based Integrated Dental Holdings, Europe\u2019s biggest dental chain, which operates almost 650 practices in the UK, says it provides both private and NHS treatment and that some 350 of its UK practices are taking new NHS patients.</p> <p>Mildenhall is too small to do so and will remain closed to new registrations for the foreseeable future, but the company says Mildenhall is one of its practices offering a \u201ctruly affordable private alternative\u201d fixed-price scheme called access mydentist.</p> <p>Under this scheme, an adult pays \u00a330 for a check-up compared to \u00a321.60 paid by non-exempt NHS patients (many, but not all, people receiving low-income benefits are exempt from paying to go to the dentist). Examination and a small filling costs \u00a379 under the scheme, compared to \u00a359.10 on the NHS.

      "bodyText": "An MP\u2019s meet-and-greet visit to a dental practice in their constituency would usually pass without comment. But when the MP is the secretary of state for health and social care, and the practice is not only closed to new NHS patients but actively promoting a private alternative, people take note. Matt Hancock\u2019s recent visit to the mydentist practice in Mildenhall, Suffolk, has raised eyebrows all the more for his apparent endorsement of its private treatment scheme. \u201cDentistry has always been a mixed market with some people paying and others on the NHS,\u201d he told the Bury Free Press. \u201cThat system has served Britain well for a long time and any ideas for how to strengthen that offer are very welcome.\u201d Meanwhile, news was breaking on the other side of England of the desperation of David Woodhouse, 62, from Truro, Cornwall, who claimed he had resorted to extracting one of his own teeth with pliers after a fruitless search of up to 100 miles to find an NHS dentist. \u201cThe removal itself was considerably less painful than the long-term pain I was experiencing,\u201d he said. There is a growing sense that NHS dentistry is at \u2013 or may even already have passed \u2013 a tipping point. A new report by market analysts LaingBuisson suggests that while the \u201chigh street\u201d dental sector as a whole remains robust, with forecast annual growth of 2%-2.5% over the next three years, this is down to expanding private care, particularly cosmetic treatments such as teeth whitening and straightening. The report\u2019s author, Philip Blackburn, says: \u201cAt the same time, NHS dentistry is falling behind and policy-makers face a clear challenge to ensure demand for NHS dentistry is being met across the UK.\u201d On LaingBuisson\u2019s figures, the overall UK dental market is worth \u00a37.1bn a year. For 2017-18, the period covered by the report, NHS market share is put at less than \u00a33.5bn. As patients pay almost \u00a31bn of that in NHS charges, this means that they are paying for nearly two-thirds of all non-hospital dentistry. The dental surgery Hancock visited is of course far from unusual in being closed to new NHS patients: the British Dental Association (BDA) says fewer than one in 10 practices in Hancock\u2019s West Suffolk constituency accepts adult NHS registrations, with just one in five registering children. Mydentist, the trading name of Manchester-based Integrated Dental Holdings, Europe\u2019s biggest dental chain, which operates almost 650 practices in the UK, says it provides both private and NHS treatment and that some 350 of its UK practices are taking new NHS patients. Mildenhall is too small to do so and will remain closed to new registrations for the foreseeable future, but the company says Mildenhall is one of its practices offering a \u201ctruly affordable private alternative\u201d fixed-price scheme called access mydentist. Under this scheme, an adult pays \u00a330 for a check-up compared to \u00a321.60 paid by non-exempt NHS patients (many, but not all, people receiving low-income benefits are exempt from paying to go to the dentist). Examination and a small filling costs \u00a379 under the scheme, compared to \u00a359.10 on the NHS. Charges for more complex work are considerably higher, however: a filling, root canal treatment and a crown can work out at up to \u00a3639 with access mydentist, compared to an upper limit of \u00a3256.50 on the NHS. Henrik Overgaard-Nielsen, BDA chair of general practice, says: \u201cPatients value a choice between private and NHS dentistry, but Matt Hancock seems content that many of his own constituents have been left with no options.\u201d If NHS dentistry has not yet passed its tipping point, Brexit may prove the nudge that sends it over. According to a survey for the General Dental Council, which registers UK dentists and counts on its books some 6,300 who qualified elsewhere in Europe, almost one in three of them is considering leaving the country. Asked why, half cited Brexit outright and more than eight in 10 said it was a \u201csignificant factor\u201d. A BDA survey last year found that 68% of English NHS dental practices trying to recruit dentists had struggled to do so. The number of free NHS treatments given to exempt patients plunged by almost a quarter from 8.8 million in 2013-14 to 6.8 million in 2017-18. Mick Armstrong, the BDA\u2019s chair, warns that \u201cwholly preventable\u201d tooth decay is going unchecked. \u201cThe writing is on the wall,\u201d he says. \u201cNHS dentistry can\u2019t be run without dentists.\u201d",

Inaugural committee spokeswoman Kristin Celauro told the Associated Press that the committee had received the subpoena and was still reviewing it. \u201cIt is our intention to cooperate with the inquiry,\u201d she said. A second spokesman, Owen Blicksilver, declined to answer questions about which documents prosecutors requested. The US attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, which issued the subpoena, declined to comment.

The Russia inquiry, which has ensnared several senior figures from his presidential campaign, appears close to the end. But the administration is preparing for a blitz of oversight investigations that the newly empowered House Democrats have promised. The subpoena, first reported by ABC, represents an escalation of the investigation, headed by the public corruption unit of the Manhattan US attorney\u2019s office.

The Wall Street Journal reported in December that prosecutors were in the \u201cearly stages\u201d of an investigation into whether Trump\u2019s inaugural committee and a pro-Trump Super Pac received illegal donations from foreigners hoping for influence over US policy. Investigators are reportedly examining how the committee spent the money as well as whether the donations \u2013 a record sum raised for such an event \u2013 were made in return for influence over policy or access to the Trump administration as it entered power. The Times reported that the inquiry was focused on whether individuals from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern nations used \u201cstraw donors\u201d to hide their own gifts to the Trump funds. The Journal reported that the investigation arose from an FBI raid on the home of Michael Cohen, Donald Trump\u2019s longtime lawyer and fixer who has been sentenced to three years in prison for lying to Congress and facilitating illegal payments to silence two women who alleged affairs with Trump. FBI agents raided Cohen\u2019s home and office in April, which resulted in the disclosure of a recorded conversation between the lawyer and Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former adviser to Melania Trump, according to the newspaper.

While promoting his film Cold Pursuit, which centres on a man\u2019s desire for revenge, Neeson reveals his own experience of seeking vengeance. Someone close to him was raped. \u201cMy immediate reaction was \u2026\u201d Neeson <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/liam-neeson-interview-rape-race-black-man-revenge-taken-cold-pursuit-a8760896.html\" title=\"\">told the Independent</a>. \u201cI asked, did she know who it was? No.\u201d From here on, we are no longer talking about the woman or sexual violence. Her trauma has become a cypher for Neeson\u2019s desire for retribution.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat colour were they?\u201d he asked. This is an odd question. When I\u2019ve spoken to friends who have been sexually assaulted it has never occurred to me to ask this. How does it inform your understanding of a rape or comfort the survivor if you know the race of the rapist?</p> \n<p>I cannot speak to Neeson\u2019s motivation. I cannot tell you why he has not asked about the colour of her attacker\u2019s eyes, his approximate age or height. But it is possible to speak to the centuries-old role that black male sexuality plays in the justification of racism in general and lynching in particular. The threat of the violation of white women by black men \u2013 both real and, more often, imagined \u2013 has long stood at the core of racist tropes and atrocities. It would make sense if the police asked the question because, along with other identifying information, it might help them find the perpetrator. But Neeson, as we soon find out, isn\u2019t asking so he can actually bring someone to justice. Quite the opposite.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe said it was a black person.\u201d At this point one has to wonder what would have happened if the answer had been a white person. Would Neeson have gone out looking for a \u201cwhite bastard\u201d to kill? Or would he just have killed himself? Is the race of the attacker only relevant if they are black? Or can we share this bigotry around?</p> \n<p>Neeson continues. \u201cI went up and down areas with a cosh, hoping I\u2019d be approached by somebody \u2013 I\u2019m ashamed to say that \u2013 and I did it for maybe a week, hoping some \u2018black bastard\u2019 would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something, you know? So that I could \u2026 kill him.\u201d</p> \n<p>So there it is. Neeson is angry and upset and decides to invest his rage in the collective punishment of a group of people based on the colour of their skin. It is perhaps now clearer to some why the early 21st century needed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/10/white-guilt-america-walter-scott-us\" title=\"\">a movement called Black Lives Matter</a>. Because the man who performed a tender <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/10/widows-review-steve-mcqueen-viola-davis-london-film-festival\" title=\"\">love scene with Viola Davis</a> is the same man who fantasised about killing her husband or stepson or anyone else who looked like them. Because the sanctity of black life has yet to be settled. When some white people look at us they see anything from a misplaced grievance to a cautionary tale. What they do not see are human beings. We are still fair game.</p> \n<p>This is not some historical problem. It is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/01/gary-younge-farewell-to-america\" title=\"\">lived reality</a>. There was Gregory Alan Bush, in October, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/25/kentucky-kroger-grocery-store-shooting\" title=\"\">who allegedly told a witness</a>: \u201cWhites don\u2019t shoot whites\u201d after shooting two black people at a Kentucky grocery store, having first tried to gain entry to a black church; the black security guard in Chicago <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/13/us/security-officer-police-shooting-suburban-chicago/index.html\" title=\"\">shot dead by police</a> in November while doing his job; the Nashville police officer <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/18/us/nashville-police-officer-andrew-delke-indicted/index.html\" title=\"\">indicted last month</a> for fatally shooting a man in the back as he ran away.</p> \n<p>We should, of course, not ignore Neeson\u2019s shame in this. We all do things we regret. We are all fragile. It takes courage to admit the things that we are most ashamed of. Indeed from his point of view that\u2019s the whole point of the story. \u201cIt was horrible, horrible, when I think back, that I did that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s awful. And I\u2019ve never admitted that, and I\u2019m saying it to a journalist. God forbid.\u201d</p> \n<p>Luckily for Neeson, the journalist was forgiving to a fault. \u201cIs it possible to hear that said out loud or to read those words and not judge?\u201d she asked. \u201cThen again, think of the circumstance \u2013 he had learnt someone close to him had been raped. No one would ever want to have to confront that in their own life. Do other people react that way?\u201d</p> \n<p>Look into your hearts and tell me who among you has not had racially motivated homicidal urges. Which of us has not been there? From here on, the focus of concern strays from the rape survivor, beyond the intended victims of his week-long racial pathology, to Neeson himself. He is the real victim here. Spare a thought for the poor fellow. It\u2019s hard being a white guy and harbouring all this rage.</p> \n<p>There are several problems with this narrative, but for now let\u2019s focus on just a couple. The first is that it ignores the very low bar that has been set. Since when did people get credit for confessing that they once thought about killing innocent people on the basis of their race and have since thought better of it? And second, the path to redemption storyline only works if Neeson learns something. But in his own words the moral of his story is this:</p> \n<p>\u201cI did learn a lesson from it, when I eventually thought, \u2018What the fuck are you doing,\u2019 you know?\u201d. That\u2019s it? No we don\u2019t know, Neeson. Buford Posey, I later learned, became <a href=\"http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/046.html\" title=\"\">a lifelong committed anti-racist</a>. What the fuck are you doing?</p> \n<p>\u2022 Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Pink Ghost; I Was Too Young to be Carrying Your Ashes; and You Were Still There.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The last, You Were Still There, is painted face-on, a woman etiolated and floating in the depths of the canvas like a Giacometti painting, her head crowned with the suggestion of a halo, her belly darkened by the roiling suggestion of a living thing within.</p> <p>Emin is haunted, and painting doesn\u2019t offer much by way of exorcism. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/apr/22/features.magazine27\">The horrific botched abortion she had in 1990</a>, the rapes that she endured as a teenager, the death of her father: all that is still there, brutal and gut-felt. Added to the mix is fresh grief \u2013 the recent death of her mother \u2013 and sickly, accreted layers of love squandered and trust betrayed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/28/my-hero-louise-bourgeois-emin\">My hero: Louise Bourgeois by Tracey Emin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Throughout these latest paintings, ghostly figures float half-realised in the depths, part obscured by thin wash, but refusing to disappear completely. In some works they are spectral. In Can You Hear Me, two indistinct forms hover at a table laid with a Ouija board. Elsewhere, the ghostly figures are characters slipping into the past. </p> <p>In I Made You Happen, passionate red lines show the artist lying in bed beside a man, but they are rendered indistinct beneath a scrub of white paint. After partly erasing the red lines, Emin has reasserted her presence on the canvas as a black outline, its face dissolving in an inky pool that casts streaks down the canvas like tears through mascara.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4113275859c5f3e5e9d67b1c93048142739633ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4113275859c5f3e5e9d67b1c93048142739633ce/0_187_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A visitor walks past No Love at the launch of A Fortnight of Tears.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A visitor walks past No Love at the launch of A Fortnight of Tears.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The watery title is apt for a show that finds Emin exploiting paint\u2019s liquid nature to painful, visceral ends. In And So It Felt Like This, the spare details of a female figure are deftly sketched with fine blue lines on to a whitish background pulsing with suggested, shadowy figures. In the gap between her legs is a triangle of paint the colour of dried blood, applied crudely with a wide brush, and so wet that it gushes down the canvas as though cascading from an open wound.</p> <p>That fat, paint-laden brush is used more violently in other paintings, where \u2013 armed with indigo, black and shit brown \u2013 it masks horrors we\u2019re not allowed to see. The artist\u2019s blank, turned face appears in They Held Me Down While He Fucked Me but the assault of the title is painted over \u2013 perhaps in anguish, perhaps in defiance.</p> <p>For, as Emin\u2019s art reminds us, emotional responses are seldom neat and compartmentalised.

      "bodyText": "A Fortnight of Tears \u2013 a powerful show of new work by Tracey Emin at the White Cube Bermondsey in London \u2013 opens with a trio of saint-like figures, each portraying the nature of their martyrdom. Shown along one wall, they form a triptych of loss: figures enduring the agonies of heartbreak, bereavement and reproductive trauma. To the left, I Watched You Disappear. Pink Ghost is veal pale, a sketchy suggestion of a figure, diluted, weakened and fading at the edges as if dissolved by tears. In the centre, I Was Too Young to be Carrying Your Ashes is hot, weighty and furious, flooded with thick red and black paint pushed hard into the canvas. The last, You Were Still There, is painted face-on, a woman etiolated and floating in the depths of the canvas like a Giacometti painting, her head crowned with the suggestion of a halo, her belly darkened by the roiling suggestion of a living thing within. Emin is haunted, and painting doesn\u2019t offer much by way of exorcism. The horrific botched abortion she had in 1990, the rapes that she endured as a teenager, the death of her father: all that is still there, brutal and gut-felt. Added to the mix is fresh grief \u2013 the recent death of her mother \u2013 and sickly, accreted layers of love squandered and trust betrayed. Throughout these latest paintings, ghostly figures float half-realised in the depths, part obscured by thin wash, but refusing to disappear completely. In some works they are spectral. In Can You Hear Me, two indistinct forms hover at a table laid with a Ouija board. Elsewhere, the ghostly figures are characters slipping into the past. In I Made You Happen, passionate red lines show the artist lying in bed beside a man, but they are rendered indistinct beneath a scrub of white paint. After partly erasing the red lines, Emin has reasserted her presence on the canvas as a black outline, its face dissolving in an inky pool that casts streaks down the canvas like tears through mascara. The watery title is apt for a show that finds Emin exploiting paint\u2019s liquid nature to painful, visceral ends. In And So It Felt Like This, the spare details of a female figure are deftly sketched with fine blue lines on to a whitish background pulsing with suggested, shadowy figures. In the gap between her legs is a triangle of paint the colour of dried blood, applied crudely with a wide brush, and so wet that it gushes down the canvas as though cascading from an open wound. That fat, paint-laden brush is used more violently in other paintings, where \u2013 armed with indigo, black and shit brown \u2013 it masks horrors we\u2019re not allowed to see. The artist\u2019s blank, turned face appears in They Held Me Down While He Fucked Me but the assault of the title is painted over \u2013 perhaps in anguish, perhaps in defiance. For, as Emin\u2019s art reminds us, emotional responses are seldom neat and compartmentalised. The pain experienced on the death of a parent is not sealed off and separate from the pain of a disintegrating relationship, or the pain that wells when you remember the child you didn\u2019t and can never have. These feelings flood chaotically and confusingly together. A suite of sketches made in 2016, just after her mother\u2019s death, addresses all this loss as a welter. In text, Emin\u2019s tone is epistolary, addressing an unspecified other: \u201cI could See you in my mind,\u201d \u201cEvery Part of me kept Loving you,\u201d \u201cI carried you.\u201d In these small works on paper, it is unclear who the absent \u201cyou\u201d is: mother, lover or unborn child. Emin arrived as a confessional artist, using raw material of the self: body and soul. Her work remains a riposte to the weird constipated stoicism of British respectability. At this stage in her career, painting at a scale that tests the bounds of her reach, the brutal honesty no longer feels confessional: it\u2019s more about asserting distinctly female tragedy as a subject for great art. Of course there is precedent. In doggedly revisiting the sites of early trauma she shares lineage with Louise Bourgeois. A pair of outsized bronzes \u2013 I Lay Here for You and When I Sleep \u2013 recall the women curled in agony in Paula Rego\u2019s Abortion series. There\u2019s also still a long way to go. The Insomnia Room Installation portrays a different kind of haunting. Fifty cameraphone selfies, printed two metres high, show the artist\u2019s face as she lies in bed crippled with fatigue but unable to sleep. We are put on intimate terms with her nightwear as well as various facial injuries, among them a fat lip, scabby wasp sting and post-operative stitches on her eyelids.

Vladimir Putin looks forward to western Europe becoming poorer and more disunited, and to an inward-looking and newly fissiparous UK preoccupied with finding scapegoats for the loss of prosperity consequent on ditching so many of the trade arrangements built up over the last 43 years.

Thankfully, we are still able to salvage some joy from this year\u2019s Oscars, because the annual Oscar nominee luncheon took place on Monday.</p> <p>These luncheons are always terrific, partly for the fawning behind-the-scenes coverage they prompt (Vanity Fair reported a meeting between Bradley Cooper and Spike Lee that included the detail that \u201cCooper bowed his head and made prayer hands\u201d), but mainly for the group photo that happens at the end. Every year this photo is perfect: a Where\u2019s Wally of weird outfits and mistimed yawns and forced happiness. Here are this year\u2019s winners and losers.</p> <h2>1. Most radioactive tan: Bradley Cooper (back row, seventh from left)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a67812c1f0883b18592bd45829db4afe812028b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a67812c1f0883b18592bd45829db4afe812028b8/0_18_1014_608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"91st Oscars\u00ae, Nominees Luncheon, Class PhotoBradley Cooper.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Star wattage \u2026 Bradley Cooper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Todd Wawrychuk/\u00a9A.M.P.A.S.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the life of me, I cannot work out why Bradley Cooper is that colour. Has he mistaken lard for sunscreen? Did he accidentally get sprayed by manure on the way to the luncheon? Is he preparing for his role in an as-yet-unannounced Donald Trump biopic? I just hope he\u2019s OK.</p> <h2>2. Jauntiest hat: Barry Alexander Brown (third row, ninth from left)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f24e12f14fa9c15625e9a976283b90a877229c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f24e12f14fa9c15625e9a976283b90a877229c6/0_14_786_472/500.jpg\" alt=\"Fresh angle \u2026 Barry Alexander Brown.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fresh angle \u2026 Barry Alexander Brown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Todd Wawrychuk/\u00a9A.M.P.A.S.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These class photos are usually a showground for all manner of ill-judged headwear. Not this year, though; only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/14/blackkklansman-review-spike-lee-adam-driver-cannes-2018\">BlacKkKlansman</a> editor Barry Alexander Brown dared to don a hat, and he pulled it off impeccably. Why, it almost looks as if he\u2019s come as a one-man George Galloway tribute act. High praise indeed.</p> <h2>3. Least convincing alt-rock hippy: Viggo Mortensen (front row, fifth from right)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"839465fbfa935cce7ac0de392cee966998cc2914\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/839465fbfa935cce7ac0de392cee966998cc2914/0_0_1297_778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beatlemaniac? \u2026 Viggo Mortensen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beatlemaniac? \u2026 Viggo Mortensen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Todd Wawrychuk/\u00a9Ampas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Viggo, for crying out loud, what the hell are you doing with your fingers? The peace sign? Who do you think you are, Ringo flipping Starr? Stop this wanton politicising of a public event. (Although let it be known that I will withdraw my scorn if it transpires that you were simply signalling to somebody offscreen how many hamburgers you wanted.)</p> <h2>4. Most sudden hand confusion: Mildred Iatrou Morgan (third row, far right)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7de6bbee5811ebf362b8b5d0bafbf5731c31458\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7de6bbee5811ebf362b8b5d0bafbf5731c31458/79_100_1368_821/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Palm d\u2019Or \u2026 Mildred Iatrou Morgan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Palm d\u2019Or \u2026 Mildred Iatrou Morgan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Todd Wawrychuk/\u00a9A.M.P.A.S.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Talk about drawing the short straw. Most of the nominees got a seat, which meant they could hide their hands in their lap. Sound editor Iatrou, though, ended up being stuck out on the end of a row. Nobody ever knows what to do with their hands in a position like this, so all power to her for going full splay.</p> <h2>5. Smartest LinkedIn profile shot: Will Fetters (second row, sixth from right)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3cd202474e84beec69d4478bafc2f405d5f6b357\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cd202474e84beec69d4478bafc2f405d5f6b357/0_34_1149_689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hire power \u2026 Will Fetters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hire power \u2026 Will Fetters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Todd Wawrychuk/\u00a9A.M.P.A.S.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A screenwriter like Fetters doesn\u2019t have his photo taken very often, so it\u2019s wise of him to angle his body away from the camera, clasp his hands together and squint like a moderately successful tech CEO. This pose screams: \u201cI follow 30,000 people on Twitter and overuse the hashtag #selfstarter.\u201d</p> <h2>6. Actual giant: Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (back row, eighth from right)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c46a73ecfe9d269bd836551e56c035d1beda784\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c46a73ecfe9d269bd836551e56c035d1beda784/0_30_1051_631/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lofty ambitions \u2026 Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lofty ambitions \u2026 Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Todd Wawrychuk/\u00a9A.M.P.A.S.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck has the best name in the world and is nearly 7ft tall. There isn\u2019t a chance I\u2019m going to be mean about him.</p> <h2>7. Biggest Avengers: Endgame spoiler (Sam Rockwell, fifth row, fifth from right)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d21262b34cdf4f4029b0a571456459dc1e5d2e14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d21262b34cdf4f4029b0a571456459dc1e5d2e14/358_154_501_301/500.jpg\" alt=\"Smooth operator \u2026 Sam Rockwell.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rough with the smooth \u2026 Sam Rockwell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Todd Wawrychuk/\u00a9A.M.P.A.S.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You may remember that, in Iron Man 2, Sam Rockwell played a baddie with a full head of hair. You may also remember that, in Iron Man 1, Jeff Bridges played a baddie with no hair and a beard. Sam Rockwell attended the Oscar luncheon with no hair and a beard, which leads me to believe that Avengers: Endgame will contain a subplot about the botched genetic splicing of former MCU villains. Go crazy, internet.</p> <h2>8.

      "bodyText": "This year\u2019s Academy Awards have the potential to be the worst in history: nobody wants to host them and it\u2019s hard to get excited about any of the nominees. Thankfully, we are still able to salvage some joy from this year\u2019s Oscars, because the annual Oscar nominee luncheon took place on Monday. These luncheons are always terrific, partly for the fawning behind-the-scenes coverage they prompt (Vanity Fair reported a meeting between Bradley Cooper and Spike Lee that included the detail that \u201cCooper bowed his head and made prayer hands\u201d), but mainly for the group photo that happens at the end. Every year this photo is perfect: a Where\u2019s Wally of weird outfits and mistimed yawns and forced happiness. Here are this year\u2019s winners and losers. 1. Most radioactive tan: Bradley Cooper (back row, seventh from left) For the life of me, I cannot work out why Bradley Cooper is that colour. Has he mistaken lard for sunscreen? Did he accidentally get sprayed by manure on the way to the luncheon? Is he preparing for his role in an as-yet-unannounced Donald Trump biopic? I just hope he\u2019s OK. 2. Jauntiest hat: Barry Alexander Brown (third row, ninth from left) These class photos are usually a showground for all manner of ill-judged headwear. Not this year, though; only BlacKkKlansman editor Barry Alexander Brown dared to don a hat, and he pulled it off impeccably. Why, it almost looks as if he\u2019s come as a one-man George Galloway tribute act. High praise indeed. 3. Least convincing alt-rock hippy: Viggo Mortensen (front row, fifth from right) Viggo, for crying out loud, what the hell are you doing with your fingers? The peace sign? Who do you think you are, Ringo flipping Starr? Stop this wanton politicising of a public event. (Although let it be known that I will withdraw my scorn if it transpires that you were simply signalling to somebody offscreen how many hamburgers you wanted.) 4. Most sudden hand confusion: Mildred Iatrou Morgan (third row, far right) Talk about drawing the short straw. Most of the nominees got a seat, which meant they could hide their hands in their lap. Sound editor Iatrou, though, ended up being stuck out on the end of a row. Nobody ever knows what to do with their hands in a position like this, so all power to her for going full splay. 5. Smartest LinkedIn profile shot: Will Fetters (second row, sixth from right) A screenwriter like Fetters doesn\u2019t have his photo taken very often, so it\u2019s wise of him to angle his body away from the camera, clasp his hands together and squint like a moderately successful tech CEO. This pose screams: \u201cI follow 30,000 people on Twitter and overuse the hashtag #selfstarter.\u201d 6. Actual giant: Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (back row, eighth from right) Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck has the best name in the world and is nearly 7ft tall. There isn\u2019t a chance I\u2019m going to be mean about him. 7. Biggest Avengers: Endgame spoiler (Sam Rockwell, fifth row, fifth from right) You may remember that, in Iron Man 2, Sam Rockwell played a baddie with a full head of hair. You may also remember that, in Iron Man 1, Jeff Bridges played a baddie with no hair and a beard. Sam Rockwell attended the Oscar luncheon with no hair and a beard, which leads me to believe that Avengers: Endgame will contain a subplot about the botched genetic splicing of former MCU villains. Go crazy, internet. 8. Most eager to keep this meme thing going: Richard E Grant (back row, 13th from right) Look at him. He\u2019s just so happy to be there. Arise, internet\u2019s new boyfriend. 9. Most weirdly solemn: Paul Schrader (fifth row, 17th from left) Paul Schrader is either holding his hand to his chest because he\u2019s so deeply honoured to be recognised by his own industry, or because he\u2019s having a heart attack. Fingers crossed for the former. 10. Best dumb gawp: Skip Lievsay (third row, 13th from right) I spy a competition here. Behind the giant Oscar, sound editor Skip Lievsay and visual effects supervisor Ian Hunter are both gawping like a pair out on a daytrip from the nursery.

The failures, both emotional and sexual, of K\u00e1t\u2019a\u2019s relationship with Andrew Staples\u2019s alcoholic Tichon are chillingly and insightfully drawn. There\u2019s real chemistry between Majeski and \u010cernoch in their love scene, and a forceful reminder, at the end, that in destroying K\u00e1t\u2019a, Kabanicha has also fatally destroyed her own relationship with her son. Yet there are also lapses. K\u00e1t\u2019a\u2019s public confession of adultery takes place not in a church, but in a tram shelter, and the absence of religious imagery weakens its impact.</p> <p>Musically, however, the evening is simply stunning. Majeski, in one of the finest house debuts of recent years, sings with remarkable commitment and radiance of tone, probing K\u00e1t\u2019a\u2019s tortured psyche and crises of conscience with unflinching veracity. She sounds exquisite as she reminisces about her childhood with Emily Edmonds\u2019s pragmatic Varvara. There\u2019s real rapture in her duets with Boris, and I can think of few interpreters who have made the soul-destroying misery of the final scenes quite so tangible or poignant. \u010cernoch is very much her equal \u2013 warm in tone, ardent yet vacillating, and simmering with resentment at his treatment by Clive Bayley\u2019s brutal Dikoj.</p> <p>The rest of the cast are comparably formidable. Bickley is genuinely unnerving as she showers Majeski with scorn, manipulates Bayley and viciously dominates Staples, who keeps Tichon just the right side of empathy, so that we really feel for him by the end. Edmonds makes a spirited Varvara opposite Andrew Tortise\u2019s nerdy Kudrj\u00e1\u0161, the pair of them very much the voices of reason in an otherwise disordered world.</p> <p>The production also marks<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jun/12/edward-gardner-conductor\"> Edward Gardner</a>\u2019s long overdue main stage debut \u2013 he conducted Mozart\u2019s Il Re Pastore in the Linbury in 2006 \u2013 and he gives us a magnificent interpretation, inexorable in its momentum and perfectly attuned to both the score\u2019s lyricism and its underlying sense of unease. The playing is faultless in its richness and detail.</p> <p>\u2022 At the <a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/productions/katya-kabanova-by-richard-jones\">Royal Opera House</a>, London, until 26 February.<br></p>",

Susan Bickley\u2019s rigid, ferocious Kabanicha treats her daughter-in-law with thinly disguised contempt, and, in a departure from the original narrative, peeps from behind the curtains to watch K\u00e1t\u2019a return from her first tryst with Pavel \u010cernoch\u2019s dashingly attractive, if weak-willed Boris. Some of it is unquestionably powerful. The failures, both emotional and sexual, of K\u00e1t\u2019a\u2019s relationship with Andrew Staples\u2019s alcoholic Tichon are chillingly and insightfully drawn. There\u2019s real chemistry between Majeski and \u010cernoch in their love scene, and a forceful reminder, at the end, that in destroying K\u00e1t\u2019a, Kabanicha has also fatally destroyed her own relationship with her son. Yet there are also lapses. K\u00e1t\u2019a\u2019s public confession of adultery takes place not in a church, but in a tram shelter, and the absence of religious imagery weakens its impact. Musically, however, the evening is simply stunning. Majeski, in one of the finest house debuts of recent years, sings with remarkable commitment and radiance of tone, probing K\u00e1t\u2019a\u2019s tortured psyche and crises of conscience with unflinching veracity. She sounds exquisite as she reminisces about her childhood with Emily Edmonds\u2019s pragmatic Varvara. There\u2019s real rapture in her duets with Boris, and I can think of few interpreters who have made the soul-destroying misery of the final scenes quite so tangible or poignant. \u010cernoch is very much her equal \u2013 warm in tone, ardent yet vacillating, and simmering with resentment at his treatment by Clive Bayley\u2019s brutal Dikoj. The rest of the cast are comparably formidable. Bickley is genuinely unnerving as she showers Majeski with scorn, manipulates Bayley and viciously dominates Staples, who keeps Tichon just the right side of empathy, so that we really feel for him by the end. Edmonds makes a spirited Varvara opposite Andrew Tortise\u2019s nerdy Kudrj\u00e1\u0161, the pair of them very much the voices of reason in an otherwise disordered world. The production also marks Edward Gardner\u2019s long overdue main stage debut \u2013 he conducted Mozart\u2019s Il Re Pastore in the Linbury in 2006 \u2013 and he gives us a magnificent interpretation, inexorable in its momentum and perfectly attuned to both the score\u2019s lyricism and its underlying sense of unease. The playing is faultless in its richness and detail. \u2022 At the Royal Opera House, London, until 26 February.",

When the couple got back to their car (also registered in Beattie\u2019s name), it had a parking ticket. \u201cHe ripped it up and said: \u2018We don\u2019t need to worry about that now, we\u2019re loaded!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Beattie was 22 at the time. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/14/economic-abuse-crime-poverty-suffered-domestic-violence\" title=\"\">She had never heard of \u201ceconomic abuse\u201d</a>, nor even \u201cdomestic abuse\u201d, although she was certainly living with it. She had met her partner, her first boyfriend, while still at college and within months had become pregnant. He was jealous, controlling, then violent and when she finally managed to end the relationship at the age of 24, he beat her so badly, she required reconstructive surgery.</p> <p>But this is not what Beattie wants to talk about. During their five years together, she struggled to provide the basics for her son and herself with child benefits and minimal support from her partner, who owned a bike shop. He was secretive with money, he gambled, he loaned cash to his friends. He helped himself to her bank card to withdraw money and made her sign up for store cards. He frittered away that \u00a36,000 loan in months. \u201cIt went so fast,\u201d she says. \u201cThe only thing I got to show for it was our son\u2019s first bed.\u201d</p> <p>When she was finally free, out of hospital and rebuilding her life, those debts caught up with her. \u201cI\u2019d got a housing transfer,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I had nothing \u2013 no furniture, sheets for curtains \u2013 and the demands started coming. The amount had grown to \u00a320,000, letter after letter threatening court action. I\u2019d ring around and try to explain the situation, but I\u2019m still paying to this day. I\u2019ll be paying for the next 16 years.\u201d</p> <p>This \u2013 along with her ex\u2019s constant failure to pay regular maintenance for their 10-year-old son \u2013 has been her hardest battle. \u201cThe economic consequences are with me every single day, a cloud hanging over me,\u201d says Beattie, who has started a business dedicated to raising awareness of domestic abuse. \u201cHe gets to move on and I\u2019m caught in this invisible chain pulling me back and dragging me down.\u201d</p> <p>The inclusion of \u201ceconomic abuse\u201d <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46939735\" title=\"\">in the draft domestic abuse bill</a>, which was published in January, is an acknowledgment, finally, of something that has, say campaigners, been hidden in plain sight. The bill\u2019s definition of economic abuse isn\u2019t limited to controlling someone\u2019s access to money, but also the things money can buy: a car, a phone, petrol, food, heating. It might mean tightly monitoring someone\u2019s spending, running up debts in their name, emptying their account or sabotaging their working life. In one case, cited by the then home secretary Amber Rudd when she appeared on The One Show, it was identified by police on a call out when they saw a Post-it note on the fridge. The note read: \u201cAsk the master before helping yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Nicola Sharp-Jeffs, the founder of the charity Surviving Economic Abuse (SEA), was instrumental in getting a definition of economic abuse included, but she says it doesn\u2019t go far enough. \u201cThe bill doesn\u2019t criminalise economic abuse in and of itself, which is what we wanted,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re hoping to capture it under the offence of coercive control. But having a statutory definition is a good first step. It helps survivors and police to recognise it, and makes it easier for banks to understand.\u201d The bill has also committed funds for the training of frontline workers and the support of victims, much of which will be administered through SEA.</p> <p>It was while working in policy for a domestic abuse charity that Sharp-Jeffs found her focus drawn to this issue. \u201cSpeaking to survivors, economic abuse just threaded through everything,\u201d she says. \u201cIt may have controlled someone\u2019s everyday life, like where she was able to go or what she could eat. It fed into emotional abuse, as it was degrading, infantalising, reinforcing the message of worthlessness. It put people in physical danger as they didn\u2019t have the resources to leave. And it could very seriously impact their ability to rebuild life post-separation.\u201d</p> <p>Although there are no national statistics, studies of abusive relationships suggest economic abuse is present in up to 99% of them, and often the first sign of coercive control. The largest study was carried out by <a href=\"https://www.refuge.org.uk/our-work/campaigns/my-money-my-life-2/\" title=\"\">Sharp-Jeffs with the Co-operative Bank</a>. It found that one in five people in the general population have experienced economic abuse, 60% of them women. The same study suggested women experience it for longer, with nearly 80% of those reporting abuse saying it lasted more than five years, compared with 23% of the men. There was also a marked difference in what was interpreted as abuse. \u201cWomen tended to say their partners denied them money for food, rent or electricity,\u201d says Sharp-Jeffs. \u201cMen were more likely to say they\u2019d been denied money for beer or hobbies.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cd1e0c6c0b918d2aa5f54ad8708562d9acd2b80a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd1e0c6c0b918d2aa5f54ad8708562d9acd2b80a/0_0_3522_2113/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Sharp-Jeffs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Sharp-Jeffs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew F Spicer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps this highlights why the issue has stayed beneath the radar, far behind physical violence and emotional abuse when it comes to public awareness. The way couples arrange finances and share resources, what\u2019s fair or normal, is a private, slippery and subjective. \u201cIt also plays perfectly into gender norms,\u201d says Sharp-Jeffs. \u201cThere\u2019s still a perception that women aren\u2019t so good with money. It\u2019s very easy for men to take control under the guise of: \u2018I\u2019ll look after you.\u2019\u201d (Perhaps this also explains why that bank clerk thought it appropriate to step back while Beattie\u2019s partner talked her into taking a loan.)</p> <p>Sarah Pennells, a personal finance journalist and the creator of money website <a href=\"https://www.savvywoman.co.uk/\" title=\"\">savvywoman.co.uk</a>, agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s a lazy stereotype but it\u2019s still often expected that the men will take care of the \u2018important stuff\u2019, like mortgages and pensions, which is where the real money is,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cI receive more emails than I\u2019d like from women who\u2019ve found that taking maternity leave or stopping work to raise children has been a trigger for change. Slowly, shared finances became \u2018his money\u2019 and the women were edged out of financial decisions. They feel uncomfortable about it, but aren\u2019t sure if it was normal because money isn\u2019t something we talk about. And once the pattern is set, it becomes very hard to unpick.\u201d</p> <p>Susan Crick (not her real name), who is in her 60s, owned her own flat and had a company car when she met her husband more than 30 years ago. He was just starting his professional career when they bought their first house, and Crick paid for the renovation and paid off his overdraft. She left her job when her children were born \u2013 three within four years \u2013 and that was when her husband took over the finances.</p> <p>\u201cLooking back, I was naive,\u201d she says. \u201cBut my parents had very traditional roles. My mum was very well educated, but never worked because my dad didn\u2019t allow it.\u201d Crick\u2019s husband opened a joint account for them, she closed her personal account and he retained full control of spending.</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t write a cheque unless he gave permission. Everything had to be under his control,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I was buying clothes, he came and made the decisions. I once bought a jacket on my own and he was so angry \u2013 \u2018It\u2019s not your money!\u2019 \u2013 I never did it again. The holidays, the food I served, the cars we drove \u2013 it was up to him.\u201d Her husband was also emotionally abusive, critical, thought nothing of calling her a \u201cpig\u201d or an \u201cidiot\u201d in company, and mocked her ideas for new careers.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I left him after more than 10 years, I was so humiliated, my self-esteem was rock bottom,\u201d she says. \u201cI had no job, no savings. He had become successful and very well-connected and I knew he\u2019d destroy me.\u201d</p> <p>Economic abuse can continue years after a relationship has ended. \u201cMy ex used it as a form of punishment,\u201d says Crick. \u201cHe contested every single aspect of the separation for years to come \u2013 the divorce, contact, holidays, the children\u2019s school, my attempts to move out of London. He went to court over everything and the cost was catastrophic. I had to increase my mortgage three times and ended up on a debt plan. At times, I thought of suicide. I tell girls now to hold on to their jobs and have their own money. It\u2019s power.\u201d</p> <p>Sharp-Jeffs agrees education is key. \u201cYoung people should learn about money as well as sex and relationships,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re encouraged to think about it from a young age \u2013 how you manage it, the choices it brings \u2013 you\u2019re more likely to know what\u2019s right or wrong in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Opening up about our financial lives would also help. Abuse thrives on secrecy and isolation. Otegha Uwagba, <a href=\"https://www.womenwho.co/\" title=\"\">founder of the network Women Who</a> and author of the bestseller Little Black Book, is writing a book called We Need to Talk About Money. \u201cMoney dominates every aspect of our lives \u2013 and the silence around it, that lack of transparency, makes women vulnerable in the workplace and in the home,\u201d she says.</p> <p>There have been progress. In October, 11 banks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/oct/13/financial-abuse-code-bring-change\" title=\"\">signed up to the Financial Abuse Code of Practice</a>, which includes the obligation to train staff to recognise it and to help victims regain control of their finances. And now the domestic abuse bill has acknowledged the issue, too.</p> <p>But that\u2019s just a start, says Sharp-Jeffs. \u201cI\u2019d like it to be an offence in and of itself, not slipped into the coercive control legislation where it gets lost,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so complex, so far reaching, we need to name it and separate it out to have the correct support. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s overly ambitious if we keep up the pressure.\u201d </p>",

He had become successful and very well-connected and I knew he\u2019d destroy me.\u201d Economic abuse can continue years after a relationship has ended. \u201cMy ex used it as a form of punishment,\u201d says Crick. \u201cHe contested every single aspect of the separation for years to come \u2013 the divorce, contact, holidays, the children\u2019s school, my attempts to move out of London. He went to court over everything and the cost was catastrophic. I had to increase my mortgage three times and ended up on a debt plan. At times, I thought of suicide. I tell girls now to hold on to their jobs and have their own money. It\u2019s power.\u201d Sharp-Jeffs agrees education is key. \u201cYoung people should learn about money as well as sex and relationships,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re encouraged to think about it from a young age \u2013 how you manage it, the choices it brings \u2013 you\u2019re more likely to know what\u2019s right or wrong in the future.\u201d Opening up about our financial lives would also help. Abuse thrives on secrecy and isolation. Otegha Uwagba, founder of the network Women Who and author of the bestseller Little Black Book, is writing a book called We Need to Talk About Money. \u201cMoney dominates every aspect of our lives \u2013 and the silence around it, that lack of transparency, makes women vulnerable in the workplace and in the home,\u201d she says. There have been progress. In October, 11 banks signed up to the Financial Abuse Code of Practice, which includes the obligation to train staff to recognise it and to help victims regain control of their finances. And now the domestic abuse bill has acknowledged the issue, too. But that\u2019s just a start, says Sharp-Jeffs. \u201cI\u2019d like it to be an offence in and of itself, not slipped into the coercive control legislation where it gets lost,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so complex, so far reaching, we need to name it and separate it out to have the correct support. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s overly ambitious if we keep up the pressure.\u201d",

They now have that clear ask. \u201cThe current backstop is toxic to those of us living in Northern Ireland and indeed for unionists across the UK because it would cause the break up of the UK into the mid and longer term.\u201d The DUP leader said she was encouraged by comments from the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, and the Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, who have both suggested a hard border could be avoided. \u201cIt is important that the scaremongering stops,\u201d she said.",

Savoury and crunchy, sweet and tangy: it\u2019s addictive stuff. Treat with caution.</p> <h2>The pork</h2> <p>Though it can be tailored to just about any protein you like, I think the juicy texture of pork works particularly well in this dish and, according to YouTubers Steph and Chris of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC54SLBnD5k5U3Q6N__UjbAw\" title=\"\">Chinese Cooking Demystified</a>, \u201colder variants\u2026 use pork belly instead of loin. At most restaurants nowadays, you\u2019ll see this with lean meat, though, and we do prefer it here.\u201d I\u2019m inclined to agree: the edge of the fat on the pork belly used by <a href=\"https://thehappyfoodie.co.uk/recipes/sweet-and-sour-pork\" title=\"\">Yan-Kit So in her Classic Chinese Cookbook</a> goes deliciously crisp in the fryer, but the rest becomes annoyingly chewy; belly is a cut better slow cooked.</p> <p>To my surprise, however, the spare ribs used in Kei Lum and Diora Fong Chan\u2019s <a href=\"https://uk.phaidon.com/store/food-cook/china-the-cookbook-9780714872247/\" title=\"\">China: The Cookbook</a> work much better, the meat remaining soft and juicy, while the bony bits are little more than vehicles for batter. Some of my testers find them a bit fiddly, however, so I\u2019m going to stick with loin, though I would urge anyone who doesn\u2019t mind getting up close and personal with some bones to give them a try (get your butcher to chop them up first; they\u2019re pretty hard on the old cleaver).</p> <p>Cut the meat nice and small; Anglo-Chinese food writer <a href=\"http://lizzieeatslondon.blogspot.com/2015/02/chinatown-kitchen.html\" title=\"\">Lizzie Mabbott</a> muses: \u201cI would go with pork shoulder strips. Chunks seem only appropriate for chicken, but I can\u2019t explain why.\u201d Having chewed my way through the great Ken Hom\u2019s mighty 5cm cubes of fatty pork neck, I can explain why: chicken is a softer meat, pork has more heft to it.</p> <p>Loin might not need much in the way of tenderising, but a brief marinade will always add flavour; we particularly like the garlicky soy mixture used by Amy and Julie Zhang in their <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/food/article-3102575/Orient-express-Dad-s-sweet-sour-pork.html\" title=\"\">Dumpling Sisters Cookbook</a>. I don\u2019t think you need to add any sugar at this point, because the sauce will be sweet anyway, but testers do enjoy the warmth of Chinese five spice in the recipe in <a href=\"https://www.cooked.com/uk/Charmaine-Solomon/Hardie-Grant-Books/The-Complete-Asian-Cookbook/China/Gwoo-lo-yook-recipe\" title=\"\">Charmaine Solomon\u2019s Complete Asian Cookbook</a>.</p> <h2>The batter</h2> <p>Slimmers stop reading now: though you can find recipes, like <a href=\"https://www.chinghehuang.com/recipes/sweet-and-sour-pork\" title=\"\">that from Ching He Huang</a>, which simply stir-fry the meat, this is not health food \u2013 most sweet and sour pork is deep-fried, often doubly so, to make it \u201cvery crisp\u201d, as Solomon puts it. You could skip the initial fry and blanch the pork first instead, as the Zhangs suggest, but that\u2019s a bit of a faff, and I think has a tendency to make the meat slightly tough. Plus it means another pan to wash up.</p> <p>Given that the pork will be tossed in the sauce before serving, it\u2019s important to make the batter robust enough to survive a dunking; Solomon\u2019s whisked egg-white coating, while almost tempura-like in its lightness, collapses into a soggy mess when it hits the wok. Far more successful is <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/a0ubrd/recipe_old_school_sweet_and_sour_pork_ie_without/\" title=\"\">Steph and Chris\u2019s triple coat of starch</a>, which starts by dusting the meat with cornflour to help the batter stick, before dunking it into a \u201cnice, thick\u201d flour-and-egg mixture, and finishing off with a final layer of cornflour to \u201cget that classic sort of <em>gulurou</em> [sweet and sour ] shape and texture\u201d. It\u2019s sturdy enough to maintain some crunch on the plate, and thick enough to keep the meat within tender \u2013 and, most importantly, completely delicious.</p> <h2>The sauce</h2> <p>The protein is a movable feast, however; you could probably even make this dish from battered Mars bars if you wanted, because the important thing is the sauce. Chef Jeremy Pang of <a href=\"https://schoolofwok.co.uk/classes?nextAvailable=true&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9YKX9ubv3wIVZLftCh2TDA8hEAAYASAAEgJnAvD_BwE\" title=\"\">School of Wok</a> writes in his book Chinese Unchopped: \u201cIn the old days (way before the internet), sweet and sour was not red in colour at all, as it was predominantly made up of vinegar, sugar and dark soy sauce. However, with the heavy influence western culture now has, the Cantonese have found that ketchup provides the perfect balance and wrapping consistency for this dish. Who\u2019s to say this recipe upgrade isn\u2019t just as authentic as the old ways? As with any culture as it changes and adapts, it doesn\u2019t make its expressions any less authentic; it just makes them a product of the times.\u201d</p> <p>Lum and Chan stick with this old version, making a sauce from red vinegar and brown sugar that proves surprisingly effective, and, as Steph and Chris note, there\u2019s nothing wrong with using ketchup, it\u2019s \u201cbeen around in China since around the turn of the 20th century\u201d. But having done some investigation as to what came before, they conclude the \u201cpredominant opinion is that the sauce was made using <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TaR8racD8&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"\">shanzha</a>, known in English as Chinese hawberry. Shanzha is an incredibly tart fruit that looks a bit like a small apple and has this vibrant red skin.\u201d It\u2019s not easy to find out of season, even in China: chef <a href=\"https://thefoodist.uk/about/\" title=\"\">Lap-fai Lee</a>, who put me on to the hawberry idea in the first place, recommends a Chinese sweet called haw flakes, which I fail to find in any of my three local oriental supermarkets,. Happily, they recommend a slightly surprising alternative: apricot jam mixed with cranberry puree, which, they say, with a squeeze of lemon juice, makes \u201csomething that, while certainly not 100% the same as shanzha sauce, is pretty close\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"103699ae87ed0b0c223b785a4da494ab33e9dbef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/103699ae87ed0b0c223b785a4da494ab33e9dbef/465_343_6126_6127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Find the right flavour combination for your sauce, and don\u2019t be afraid to use ketchup.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Find the right flavour combination for your sauce, and don\u2019t be afraid to use ketchup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Matthews/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They concede, however, that \u201cif you don\u2019t feel like screwing around with these fruit pastes, obviously don\u2019t hesitate to reach for the ketchup. Basically every restaurant in Guangdong uses it, the vast majority of families use it \u2026 it\u2019s absolutely an authentic addition to the dish.\u201d I try a dollop of trusty Heinz in the Zhangs, So and Solomon\u2019s recipes, and find that, when mixed with extra vinegar and sugar, it does indeed produce a sauce very close to the stuff I remember from restaurants \u2013 though not, it must be noted, quite as sweet and orange and gloopy as the glorious \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl72YusTGsY&amp;feature=youtu.be\">proper sweet and sour sauce, like you get from a takeaway</a>\u201d made by chefs Chin and Choo Ziang using distilled malt vinegar and orange squash \u2013 \u201cif you\u2019ve ever wondered what that flavour is you can\u2019t quite grasp, it\u2019s orange squash\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqa99xSaTWM\" title=\"\">Ken Hom</a>, meanwhile, uses fresh orange juice, and So puts in pineapple juice \u2013 the extra citrussy tang of all of the versions using fruit prove more popular than the tasty but somewhat one-dimensional ketchup-only recipes, but most popular of all is the jam mixture, which has a fruity depth to it that the others lack, with a distinct berry sharpness from the cranberries. As I don\u2019t have a particularly sweet tooth, I\u2019m going to cut back on the sugar slightly (soft light brown makes a decent substitute for palm sugar here) \u2013 though feel free to adjust to your taste \u2013 and add a dash of soy sauce and Hom\u2019s red rather than white vinegar, to help balance the potentially cloying sweet and sour flavours.</p> <p>Once you\u2019re happy with the flavour, you\u2019ll need to thicken it: both cornflour and potato starch work fine for this purpose.</p> <h2>The vegetables</h2> <p>Many sweet and sour recipes are very simple indeed: Hom\u2019s contains just shallots in the way of vegetable matter, and the Zhangs stick with the classic pineapple flavoured with ginger and garlic, but I think it\u2019s far more interesting with a few other contrasting flavours and textures. I try spring onions, peas and water chestnuts, but come back to the traditional onion and green pepper pairing favoured by So, with extra pineapple \u2013 because, let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s delicious \u2013 plus a sprinkling of Steph and Chris\u2019s mild red chilli for warmth and colour. Use whatever you like, but just make sure you cut it fairly small so it stir-fries evenly.</p> <h2>Perfect sweet and sour pork</h2> <p>Prep <strong>20 min + marinating time</strong><br>Cook <strong>10 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>2</strong></p> <p><strong>200g pork loin or lean shoulder</strong><br><strong>1 garlic clove</strong>, peeled and crushed<br><strong>1 tbsp light soy sauce</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp rice wine or dry sherry</strong><br><strong>\u00bd tsp salt</strong><br><strong>\u00bc tsp Chinese five-spice powder </strong>(optional)</p> <p>To cook<br><strong>1 onion</strong><br><strong>1 green pepper</strong><br><strong>1 mild red chilli</strong><br><strong>1 egg</strong><br><strong>60g cornflour</strong>, plus extra to coat<br><strong>Vegetable oil, to fry</strong><br><strong>100g pineapple chunks</strong></p> <p>For the sauce<br><strong>2 tbsp apricot jam</strong> \u2013 the lower in sugar, the better<br><strong>1 tbsp cranberry sauce</strong>, ditto<br><strong>1 good squeeze lemon or lime juice</strong><br><strong>25-40g soft light brown sugar</strong><br><strong>2.5 tbsp Chinese red vinegar </strong>(ideally), or rice vinegar<br><strong>1 tbsp light soy sauce</strong><br><strong>1 tsp cornflour</strong><br><strong>Serve with egg fried rice and probably something fresh and green</strong></p> <p>Cut the pork into strips about 1cm wide.

Basically every restaurant in Guangdong uses it, the vast majority of families use it \u2026 it\u2019s absolutely an authentic addition to the dish.\u201d I try a dollop of trusty Heinz in the Zhangs, So and Solomon\u2019s recipes, and find that, when mixed with extra vinegar and sugar, it does indeed produce a sauce very close to the stuff I remember from restaurants \u2013 though not, it must be noted, quite as sweet and orange and gloopy as the glorious \u201cproper sweet and sour sauce, like you get from a takeaway\u201d made by chefs Chin and Choo Ziang using distilled malt vinegar and orange squash \u2013 \u201cif you\u2019ve ever wondered what that flavour is you can\u2019t quite grasp, it\u2019s orange squash\u201d. Ken Hom, meanwhile, uses fresh orange juice, and So puts in pineapple juice \u2013 the extra citrussy tang of all of the versions using fruit prove more popular than the tasty but somewhat one-dimensional ketchup-only recipes, but most popular of all is the jam mixture, which has a fruity depth to it that the others lack, with a distinct berry sharpness from the cranberries. As I don\u2019t have a particularly sweet tooth, I\u2019m going to cut back on the sugar slightly (soft light brown makes a decent substitute for palm sugar here) \u2013 though feel free to adjust to your taste \u2013 and add a dash of soy sauce and Hom\u2019s red rather than white vinegar, to help balance the potentially cloying sweet and sour flavours. Once you\u2019re happy with the flavour, you\u2019ll need to thicken it: both cornflour and potato starch work fine for this purpose. The vegetables Many sweet and sour recipes are very simple indeed: Hom\u2019s contains just shallots in the way of vegetable matter, and the Zhangs stick with the classic pineapple flavoured with ginger and garlic, but I think it\u2019s far more interesting with a few other contrasting flavours and textures. I try spring onions, peas and water chestnuts, but come back to the traditional onion and green pepper pairing favoured by So, with extra pineapple \u2013 because, let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s delicious \u2013 plus a sprinkling of Steph and Chris\u2019s mild red chilli for warmth and colour. Use whatever you like, but just make sure you cut it fairly small so it stir-fries evenly. Perfect sweet and sour pork Prep 20 min + marinating time Cook 10 min Serves 2 200g pork loin or lean shoulder 1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed 1 tbsp light soy sauce 1 tbsp rice wine or dry sherry \u00bd tsp salt \u00bc tsp Chinese five-spice powder (optional) To cook 1 onion 1 green pepper 1 mild red chilli 1 egg 60g cornflour, plus extra to coat Vegetable oil, to fry 100g pineapple chunks For the sauce 2 tbsp apricot jam \u2013 the lower in sugar, the better 1 tbsp cranberry sauce, ditto 1 good squeeze lemon or lime juice 25-40g soft light brown sugar 2.5 tbsp Chinese red vinegar (ideally), or rice vinegar 1 tbsp light soy sauce 1 tsp cornflour Serve with egg fried rice and probably something fresh and green Cut the pork into strips about 1cm wide. Put in a bowl, toss with the garlic, soy, rice wine salt and five spice, and leave to marinate for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce by stirring together the preserves and adding the citrus and sugar. Stir until the sugar dissolves, then stir in the vinegar, soy and 90ml water. Season to taste, adding more sugar, if you like. In a separate small bowl, stir together the cornflour and a teaspoon of cold water. Cut the onion and pepper into chunky diamonds, separating the onion layers as you go. Slice the chilli into rings. Beat the egg in a bowl until smooth, then stir in 60g cornflour to make a smooth batter, and season. Tip an extra tablespoon of cornflour into the pork and toss to coat. Coat a plate with more cornflour. Pour vegetable oil into a large pan or wok to fill by a third and heat to 180C /350F. Once the oil is nearly at temperature, dunk the pork in the batter, then shake off any excess and roll it in the plate of cornflour to coat. Fry in the hot oil for three minutes, until golden, then remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Keep the oil warm. Heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a wok until smoking, then stir-fry the onion, pepper and chilli until softened. Tip in the sauce mixture, bring up to a boil, then stir in the cornflour and water mixture, and cook until thickened. Add the pineapple and keep warm on a low heat. Heat the oil back up to 190C/375F and fry the pork for 30 seconds, until golden, then scoop out with a slotted spoon and transfer to the sauce. Turn up the heat, toss everything together, tip out on to a plate and serve immediately. \u2022 Sweet and sour: do you like the sharp, fruity hawberry version, or proudly prefer the sticky, sugary dish perfected by the high-street takeaway, whether with chicken, prawns or even tofu? And which other restaurant favourites would you like to recreate at home?",

The 121-mile route was built in the 1860s and has survived government cuts, bridge and tunnel collapses, and even the theft of rails \u2013 always managing, somehow, to stay open. The tales about it are legion: how a fox, pursued by hounds, leapt to its death from one viaduct; how the German Kaiser used it, incognito, in 1912; and how much it is loved by the locals. Now the love extends to a footpath, the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HeartofWalesLineTrail\" title=\"\">Heart of Wales Line Trail</a>, fully open for springtime adventures from 28 March. The trail loosely stitches the various stations together into a long-distance path that can be used in conjunction with the railway: perfect for day walks or for multi-day, short-break adventures, like the one I\u2019m about to embark on.</p> <p>A single diesel wagon pulls in. The conductor sees me aboard. We leave the main line and enter the hills at a gentle, unhurried pace, bashing branches aside and battering through the inter-rail grass before emerging in an emerald landscape of rolling hills with magnificent views.

There are several more lining the footpath. In fact, as far as I can see, Cynghordy is occupied only by cats. My first human encounter is with a farmer on a quad bike. His dog has driven a large flock of sheep up a steep hill, but one highly aggressive ewe is refusing to move. It chases the dog around the bike. The farmer grabs the sheep, throws it on the bike, and sits on it. The suddenly compliant sheep gets a lift up the hill. As they go past me, I swear it gives me a wink.</p> <p>Not for the first time on this walk I wonder if I\u2019m absorbing mind-altering substances through my boots: after all, the hill pastures are sometimes seasoned with magic mushrooms (the only mushroom that is illegal to pick). I\u2019m a little early for the spring flowers, but in the weeks to come there will be wild ramsons, vetches, orchids and bluebells \u2013 around half of the world\u2019s bluebells are in Britain and many are found here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ee9c5c7b89dfdeb75e90dbb2680a24c1f5787bda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee9c5c7b89dfdeb75e90dbb2680a24c1f5787bda/0_124_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Llandovery, Wales\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Llandovery\u2019s market square</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The farmer grabs the sheep, throws it on the bike, and sits on it.

Eager to get away from the Klan, he moved south to the German town of Giengen, and rented a small apartment with his wife and three children.</p> <p>Despite no longer being associated with the Klan, Garret says he still thought very much like a racist. Until one day, over a dinner of baked chicken and fries, Garret\u2019s beliefs about white supremacy were abruptly challenged.<br><br>At first, his landlord \u2013 a middle-aged Muslim man from Turkey named Himmet \u00d6zdemir who lived downstairs \u2013 asked Garret for some computer help. From there, \u00d6zdemir regularly hired Garret to fix his computer issues. He initially felt strange in the presence of this darker-skinned foreigner, Garret says. \u201cBut I needed the money.\u201d<br><br>\u00d6zdemir eventually invited Garret to his house for dinner with his family. \u201cI was still sitting there, waiting for him to fulfill all of the stereotypes. I was waiting for him to be that horrible Muslim,\u201d Garret recalls. \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen. He was just nice and compassionate.<br><br>\u201cI felt so ashamed, wrong, stupid and small that I had been expecting him to show his real face, while he was showing his real face the whole time. That\u2019s when I realized I had been wrong about everything.\u201d<br><br>Desperate to move on from his racist past, Garret decided it was time to cover up the \u201cskinhead\u201d tattoo spanning his upper arm. He desperately looked for a tattoo artist that would cover up the provocative marking.<br><br>\u201cThese tattoo artists would tell me: \u2018You need to know exactly what you want,\u2019 or \u2018We don\u2019t know how much it\u2019s going to cost,\u2019\u201d Garret says. \u201cI just told them to put a block bob over it. I didn\u2019t care.\u201d<br><br>The solid black banner that sits atop the word \u201cskinhead\u201d on Garret\u2019s left arm was his first cover-up tattoo. \u201cIt looks pretty horrible,\u201d Garret says, looking down his shoulder. \u201cBut at the time, all I wanted was for someone to make it go away, to make it easy.\u201d</p> <p>For several years, Garret lived a quiet life. He split from his wife (\u201cShe was still involved with white supremacy,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want that.\u201d) and began singing under the stage name The Mississippian. His music took on a new, country rock sound and his lyrics, once full of hateful tirades against minorities, now featured softer themes, such as the importance of freedom and the intractability of life.</p> <h2><strong>A new life in Mississippi</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"361284a4d015d7b923c94d66e5876674dcd4e3a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/361284a4d015d7b923c94d66e5876674dcd4e3a9/0_0_2250_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"TM Garret shows a tattoo that represents his life after leaving the world of white supremacy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">TM Garret shows a tattoo that represents his life after leaving the world of white supremacy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Melissa Golden/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2012, \u201cthe shit hit the fan\u201d, Garret says.<br><br>Amid a government investigation into rightwing violence in Germany, Garret came under intense public scrutiny for his role in the European White Knights after authorities discovered that two police officers were part of his hate group.<br><br>The investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing by Garret, according to German media. Still, the discovery of Klansmen in Germany\u2019s police force left an indelible image. Garret decided to leave the country for Mississippi.<br><br>\u201cI had lost pretty much everything,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a good time to leave.\u201d<br><br>Garret moved to Olive Branch, Mississippi, just outside of Memphis, on a work visa to open up a music video company with a friend and produce country music. He remarried, and switched his name from Achim Schmid to TM Garret (TM for his stage name, The Mississippian).<br><br>Then in July 2016, a string of incidents took place that would stoke racial animus in the US and galvanize Garret to act: a 37-year-old black man from Louisiana named <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alton-sterling-shooting\">Alton Sterling</a> was shot and killed at close range by a police officer. The following day, a 32-year-old black man, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philando-castile-shooting\">Philando Castile</a>, was shot and killed after being pulled over by a police officer in Minnesota. At a protest the next day in Dallas, Texas, a black man shot and killed five law enforcement officers.<br><br>\u201cThere was such a need to close the gap between white and black.\u201d Garret says. \u201cI said: \u2018I need to do something.\u2019 I just didn\u2019t know exactly what.\u201d<br><br>So began Garret\u2019s life in activism. Through his new not-for-profit organization Change (Care, Hope, Awareness, Need, Give and Education), Garret started speaking out publicly about his life in the Klan. He\u2019s since lectured at mosques, churches and synagogues, and is a regular lecturer with the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization based out of Los Angeles.</p> <p>Through Change, Garret started the Erase the Hate campaign. He teamed up with his close friend, Drew Darby, a longtime artist at Sickside Tattoo Studio who had previously helped Garret cover up the spider web on his left arm. Darby estimates he and his colleagues do free cover-ups for Erase the Hate roughly every week. <br><br>\u201cYou rarely get that opportunity to change someone\u2019s life,\u201d Darby says over the motor of the tattoo gun in the front studio of Sickside. \u201cThat\u2019s why I do stuff like this as a tattoo artist,\u201d Darby says. \u201cBecause when the opportunity occasionally presents itself, you have to take it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"019015fbe65272fe621d19920b544a10f3a4e923\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/019015fbe65272fe621d19920b544a10f3a4e923/0_0_2250_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nate Greer takes a smoke break outside Sickside Tattoo Studio in Horn Lake, MS before getting a cover-up tattoo over the swastika on his chest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nate Greer takes a smoke break outside Sickside Tattoo Studio before getting a cover-up tattoo over the swastika on his chest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Melissa Golden/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>His last act of courage: changing his mind</strong></h2> <p>In a room towards the front of the tattoo shop, Darby works on former white supremacist Nathan Greer\u2019s friend Josh Boyles. He\u2019s here to cover up the swastika and SS bolts on his back, which he says he \u201cearned\u201d as a member of the New Aryan Empire, an Arkansas-based offshoot of the white power prison gang the Aryan Brotherhood.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/04/a-silent-act-of-resistance-the-hidden-tattoo-studios-of-tehran\">'A silent act of resistance': the hidden tattoo studios of Tehran</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since learning in June that he was going to be a father, 31-year-old Boyles decided to quit participating in the hate group. \u201cI don\u2019t want to raise my son up with that kind of lifestyle,\u201d Boyles says. <br><br>He admits to still being racist, but \u201cI\u2019m trying to change that\u201d, he says. \u201cWhere I\u2019m from, you\u2019ve gotta stick with your own kind.\u201d</p> <p>Greer is significantly more reformed than Boyles. Before becoming sick three years ago with kidney disease, Greer says he used to hate minorities. On his way to joining the White Aryan Resistance, he got a tattoo of a swastika on his chest. \u201cIf you wasn\u2019t white, I didn\u2019t like you,\u201d he says. <br><br>Struck with heart and kidney failure, Greer fell into a coma for six months in 2016. When he woke up, he discovered that he was being tended to by a Jewish doctor and a black nurse.</p> <p>\u201cAt first, I was like, \u2018No, don\u2019t touch me,\u2019\u201d Greer recalls. \u201cAnd then the next day I was compliant. I was letting them look at me, and every day it started to get better and better until one day I was cuttin\u2019 up with them, and they were sharing with me more and more.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1e93f9bcd1aca68a57edb22c49199ffac449077e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e93f9bcd1aca68a57edb22c49199ffac449077e/0_0_2250_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nate Greer takes a smoke break outside Sickside Tattoo Studio in Horn Lake, MS.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nate Greer takes a smoke break outside Sickside Tattoo Studio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Melissa Golden/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When faced with needing open heart surgery, Greer says he had a difficult time finding a doctor willing to operate on his swastika-tattooed chest. Now that he\u2019s about to get it covered, Greer is elated. He says he\u2019s especially excited to show his 10-year-old daughter. \u201cWhen I get this tattoo covered, I\u2019ll be the happiest person in Arkansas,\u201d he says before reaching the tattoo shop.</p> <p>Later that day, once the cover-up outline is complete, Greer stands in the mirror to admire the first stage of his new tattoo. He\u2019s told to come back in three weeks to get it finished.</p> <p>With Sickside as the campaign\u2019s flagship tattoo shop, the Erase the Hate campaign has come to include a handful of other tattoo shops. A Jacksonville, Florida, tattoo shop called Inkstainz regularly offers free cover-ups to formers, as does a shop in Los Angeles. Garret says he\u2019s trying to bring in tattoo shops from New York City and Nashville, Tennessee.</p> <p>\u201cWe know it\u2019s a lot to ask these tattoo artists to give up their own time,\u201d Garret says, admiring Darby\u2019s work. Still, \u201csome people want to donate their time to helping people leave extremist environments\u201d, he adds. <br><br>Greer would never make it back to Sickside Tattoo Studio. He died of a heart attack a week and a half later in an Arkansas hospital, before his daughter got to see his new cover-up. <br><br>\u201cEven though he died before he could show it to his daughter, I hope his daughter\u2019s still aware of the amends he made before he passed,\u201d Garret says upon hearing news of Greer\u2019s death.<br><br>\u201cI think the tattoo cover-up was the one last big step for him.\u201d</p>",

At first, his landlord \u2013 a middle-aged Muslim man from Turkey named Himmet \u00d6zdemir who lived downstairs \u2013 asked Garret for some computer help. From there, \u00d6zdemir regularly hired Garret to fix his computer issues. He initially felt strange in the presence of this darker-skinned foreigner, Garret says. \u201cBut I needed the money.\u201d \u00d6zdemir eventually invited Garret to his house for dinner with his family. \u201cI was still sitting there, waiting for him to fulfill all of the stereotypes. I was waiting for him to be that horrible Muslim,\u201d Garret recalls. \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen. He was just nice and compassionate. \u201cI felt so ashamed, wrong, stupid and small that I had been expecting him to show his real face, while he was showing his real face the whole time. That\u2019s when I realized I had been wrong about everything.\u201d Desperate to move on from his racist past, Garret decided it was time to cover up the \u201cskinhead\u201d tattoo spanning his upper arm. He desperately looked for a tattoo artist that would cover up the provocative marking. \u201cThese tattoo artists would tell me: \u2018You need to know exactly what you want,\u2019 or \u2018We don\u2019t know how much it\u2019s going to cost,\u2019\u201d Garret says. \u201cI just told them to put a block bob over it. I didn\u2019t care.\u201d The solid black banner that sits atop the word \u201cskinhead\u201d on Garret\u2019s left arm was his first cover-up tattoo. \u201cIt looks pretty horrible,\u201d Garret says, looking down his shoulder. \u201cBut at the time, all I wanted was for someone to make it go away, to make it easy.\u201d For several years, Garret lived a quiet life. He split from his wife (\u201cShe was still involved with white supremacy,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want that.\u201d) and began singing under the stage name The Mississippian. His music took on a new, country rock sound and his lyrics, once full of hateful tirades against minorities, now featured softer themes, such as the importance of freedom and the intractability of life. A new life in Mississippi In 2012, \u201cthe shit hit the fan\u201d, Garret says. Amid a government investigation into rightwing violence in Germany, Garret came under intense public scrutiny for his role in the European White Knights after authorities discovered that two police officers were part of his hate group. The investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing by Garret, according to German media. Still, the discovery of Klansmen in Germany\u2019s police force left an indelible image. Garret decided to leave the country for Mississippi. \u201cI had lost pretty much everything,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a good time to leave.\u201d Garret moved to Olive Branch, Mississippi, just outside of Memphis, on a work visa to open up a music video company with a friend and produce country music. He remarried, and switched his name from Achim Schmid to TM Garret (TM for his stage name, The Mississippian). Then in July 2016, a string of incidents took place that would stoke racial animus in the US and galvanize Garret to act: a 37-year-old black man from Louisiana named Alton Sterling was shot and killed at close range by a police officer. The following day, a 32-year-old black man, Philando Castile, was shot and killed after being pulled over by a police officer in Minnesota. At a protest the next day in Dallas, Texas, a black man shot and killed five law enforcement officers. \u201cThere was such a need to close the gap between white and black.\u201d Garret says. \u201cI said: \u2018I need to do something.\u2019 I just didn\u2019t know exactly what.\u201d So began Garret\u2019s life in activism. Through his new not-for-profit organization Change (Care, Hope, Awareness, Need, Give and Education), Garret started speaking out publicly about his life in the Klan. He\u2019s since lectured at mosques, churches and synagogues, and is a regular lecturer with the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization based out of Los Angeles. Through Change, Garret started the Erase the Hate campaign. He teamed up with his close friend, Drew Darby, a longtime artist at Sickside Tattoo Studio who had previously helped Garret cover up the spider web on his left arm. Darby estimates he and his colleagues do free cover-ups for Erase the Hate roughly every week. \u201cYou rarely get that opportunity to change someone\u2019s life,\u201d Darby says over the motor of the tattoo gun in the front studio of Sickside. \u201cThat\u2019s why I do stuff like this as a tattoo artist,\u201d Darby says. \u201cBecause when the opportunity occasionally presents itself, you have to take it.\u201d His last act of courage: changing his mind In a room towards the front of the tattoo shop, Darby works on former white supremacist Nathan Greer\u2019s friend Josh Boyles. He\u2019s here to cover up the swastika and SS bolts on his back, which he says he \u201cearned\u201d as a member of the New Aryan Empire, an Arkansas-based offshoot of the white power prison gang the Aryan Brotherhood. Since learning in June that he was going to be a father, 31-year-old Boyles decided to quit participating in the hate group. \u201cI don\u2019t want to raise my son up with that kind of lifestyle,\u201d Boyles says. He admits to still being racist, but \u201cI\u2019m trying to change that\u201d, he says. \u201cWhere I\u2019m from, you\u2019ve gotta stick with your own kind.\u201d Greer is significantly more reformed than Boyles. Before becoming sick three years ago with kidney disease, Greer says he used to hate minorities. On his way to joining the White Aryan Resistance, he got a tattoo of a swastika on his chest. \u201cIf you wasn\u2019t white, I didn\u2019t like you,\u201d he says. Struck with heart and kidney failure, Greer fell into a coma for six months in 2016. When he woke up, he discovered that he was being tended to by a Jewish doctor and a black nurse. \u201cAt first, I was like, \u2018No, don\u2019t touch me,\u2019\u201d Greer recalls. \u201cAnd then the next day I was compliant. I was letting them look at me, and every day it started to get better and better until one day I was cuttin\u2019 up with them, and they were sharing with me more and more.\u201d When faced with needing open heart surgery, Greer says he had a difficult time finding a doctor willing to operate on his swastika-tattooed chest. Now that he\u2019s about to get it covered, Greer is elated. He says he\u2019s especially excited to show his 10-year-old daughter. \u201cWhen I get this tattoo covered, I\u2019ll be the happiest person in Arkansas,\u201d he says before reaching the tattoo shop. Later that day, once the cover-up outline is complete, Greer stands in the mirror to admire the first stage of his new tattoo. He\u2019s told to come back in three weeks to get it finished. With Sickside as the campaign\u2019s flagship tattoo shop, the Erase the Hate campaign has come to include a handful of other tattoo shops. A Jacksonville, Florida, tattoo shop called Inkstainz regularly offers free cover-ups to formers, as does a shop in Los Angeles. Garret says he\u2019s trying to bring in tattoo shops from New York City and Nashville, Tennessee. \u201cWe know it\u2019s a lot to ask these tattoo artists to give up their own time,\u201d Garret says, admiring Darby\u2019s work. Still, \u201csome people want to donate their time to helping people leave extremist environments\u201d, he adds. Greer would never make it back to Sickside Tattoo Studio. He died of a heart attack a week and a half later in an Arkansas hospital, before his daughter got to see his new cover-up. \u201cEven though he died before he could show it to his daughter, I hope his daughter\u2019s still aware of the amends he made before he passed,\u201d Garret says upon hearing news of Greer\u2019s death. \u201cI think the tattoo cover-up was the one last big step for him.\u201d",

Though she also takes issue with the Times\u2019 tone, describing certain headlines and language as \u201canti-Trump\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for the US morning briefing\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4300\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"A different kind of daily email\" data-form-description=\"Sign up and get a daily US news briefing from the Guardian\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks, you'll start getting the US morning briefing soon.\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for the US morning briefing</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nuanced criticism of media is fraught in the era of Trump, who will take any opening to mock the \u201cfailing New York Times\u201d, as he likes to call it. But the Times is <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/11/02/new-york-times-is-thriving-in-fiscal-2018/\">currently thriving</a>, thanks mostly \u2013 and perhaps ironically \u2013 to Trump.</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t true in the years leading up to 2011, when Abramson took the helm as its first female editor. Newspaper families, from Knight Ridder to Dow Jones, were calling it quits, and the Times\u2019 paywall blocking access to popular columnists had been an embarrassing flop. Nor had things stabilized in 2014 when, in the wake of her <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/summing-up-the-firing-of-jill-abramson\">controversial firing</a>, she set out in search of answers in the industry-wide quest for models of sustainable digital news.</p> <p>\u201cAt end of 2014, BuzzFeed and Vice were both envied by legacy companies \u2013 the shiny new stars that had just gotten recently into news,\u201d Abramson tells me.</p> <p>At first, it seemed internet natives like BuzzFeed were ahead of the game. But Trump\u2019s election and the attendant swell in subscribers at legacy outlets has turned the tables on that: at the turn of the millennium, Times subscriptions accounted for just 26% of total revenue; in August they accounted for nearly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/08/business/media/new-york-times-earnings-subscriptions.html\">two-thirds of total revenue</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe key to being a good reporter is always being willing to be surprised when you\u2019re reporting a story,\u201d Abramson says with a laugh. \u201cI was.\u201d</p> <p>She meant surprised by the evolving story arc, but she\u2019s a damn good reporter too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4d77aadfe7ed23cdbc70cd1007e36e4b49612c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4d77aadfe7ed23cdbc70cd1007e36e4b49612c1/0_240_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The key to being a good reporter is always being willing to be surprised when you\u2019re reporting a story.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The key to being a good reporter is always being willing to be surprised when you\u2019re reporting a story.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ali Smith/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before becoming executive editor of the Times in 2011, Abramson was an investigative reporter covering the Clinton White House for the Wall Street Journal. And after supreme court justice Clarence Thomas was confirmed in 1991, she spent three years looking into sexual harassment allegations brought by Anita Hill, exposing the sexist inner workings of the Senate judiciary in an award-winning book co-written with the New Yorker\u2019s Jane Mayer.</p> <p>As a columnist at the Guardian, Abramson has also been a colleague of mine. When I met her while covering the Democratic national convention in 2016, I found her an intimidating presence to sit across from over lunch. By now, she\u2019s probably used to being seen that way. One colleague once <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/08/books/review/the-lionesses.html\">memorably described her</a> as having \u201cballs like cast-iron cantaloupes\u201d \u2013 a good makeup for investigative reporting but it sometimes got her in trouble in her years as top editor at the Times.</p> <p>A dogged defender of the separation of business and editorial \u2013 \u201cchurch and state\u201d, as she refers to them in the book \u2013 the paper\u2019s perilous financial straits did little to soften her disposition.</p> <p>When, for instance, at a lunch with top executives the paper\u2019s CEO, Mark Thompson, said he expected the newsroom to help generate ideas for revenue-increasing products, Abramson wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you expect, you have the wrong executive editor,\u201d she snapped.</p> <p>A shocked silence followed and the waiter spilled the water he was pouring.</p> <p>The retort \u201chad flown out of my mouth before I could edit either its substance or its tone\u201d, Abramson wrote in what, in retrospect, reads like an epitaph for her time at the Times, a moment that was the beginning of the end.</p> <p>But even where she was unwilling to compromise, she understood the depth of the financial threat. The trouble was, no one had the solution (even when many thought they did).</p> <p>At the time, BuzzFeed and Vice were being hailed as new-media heroes and legacy outlets sought to imitate them, with forays into native and branded advertising. \u201cIt was a response to real stresses in the business models that support all of these news organizations,\u201d Abramson says of the pivots that chafed her. \u201cThey are all doing things that were not done until the very end of my time at the Times.\u201d (The newspaper, Abramson notes in her book, \u201cstrongly disagrees\u201d with her view that business considerations have had too much influence on news coverage.)</p> <p>That Abramson is still working through her experience as a central player in a pivotal moment of news history is apparent in her writing on the Times. It\u2019s also where her insights are most powerful. But her criticisms of digital media companies and their discontents are sometimes misplaced where they land on individual young staffers, some of whom, like VICE\u2019s Arielle Duhaime-Ross, have said they were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adrs/status/1084860904334856192\">inaccurately represented</a>. (Abramson <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/how-journalism-survives-an-interview-with-jill-abramson\">addressed</a> some of those claims, dismissively, in an interview with the New Yorker.)</p> <p>Nevertheless, in the five years since Abramson left the paper, a strange thing has begun to happen: the newcomers look increasingly like legacy outlets, even as legacy outlets mimicked them.</p> <p>They got interested in political scoops, started hiring top talent and forming investigative teams. They also started producing first-rate journalism, including BuzzFeed\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/viral-fake-election-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook#.jepaXOx1m\">groundbreaking coverage</a> of fake news around the 2016 election, and Vice\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIrcB1sAN8I&amp;vl=en\">footage of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia</a>.</p> <p>But the newcomers had also begun to develop legacy media\u2019s money problems, as the platforms they built themselves atop tightened their grip over revenue.</p> <p>BuzzFeed built itself on the back of Facebook and its social sharing mechanisms, while Vice built itself on YouTube, owned by Google. But in recent years <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/04/26/google-facebook-digital-ads/\">virtually all</a> digital advertising has gone to profit Facebook and Google, while media companies fight for scraps.</p> <p>In her book, Abramson has tough words for just about everyone, herself included. But she saves the worst for the increasingly monopolistic companies many news outlets have come to depend upon. \u201cI really do think the villains are Facebook and Google,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Changes to their algorithms, or a faddish emphasis on video, can spell financial calamity for outlets big and small. Last month, Abramson declared it \u201cwinter\u201d for digital media after HuffPost announced a new round of terminations and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/24/buzzfeed-to-lay-off-200-staff-in-latest-round-of-cuts\">BuzzFeed</a> called for the elimination of 15% of staff. On 1 February, Vice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/feb/01/vice-to-axe-250-staff-in-latest-round-of-digital-media-job-losses\">axed 250 staffers</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s live by it and die by it, I fear,\u201d Abramson says of using social media as your business model. \u201cYou know,\u201d she adds quickly, \u201cI hope none of these companies die.\u201d</p> <p>Still she doesn\u2019t think financial salvation is around the bend. In January, as an already beleaguered news industry suffered the loss of an additional 1,000 jobs nationally, Facebook announced the opening of its <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-facebook-looks-to-move-on-from-past-controversy/\">strongest year ever</a>. Overall newsroom employment is down nearly a quarter in less than 10 years, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/07/30/newsroom-employment-dropped-nearly-a-quarter-in-less-than-10-years-with-greatest-decline-at-newspapers/\">according to</a> a July report from the Pew Research Center.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/26/jill-abramson-interview-journalism-digital-era-trump-new-york-times\">Jill Abramson: \u2018The bleak part of the picture is the death of local papers\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The most promising business trend to emerge is a growth in reader revenue, which has been a boon to the Times, the Washington Post, the Guardian, ProPublica and others. But only a handful of news brands have been able to make it work.</p> <p>Local and regional news organizations have been decimated in recent years, a reality Abramson sees as one of the central tragedies in journalism. Even if they could attract more reader revenue now, after rounds of being soldoff and stripped down for parts, few have the bones left to compete.</p> <p>In that light, perhaps, Abramson\u2019s formerly inconvenient commitment to old-school journalistic principles seems salient: there is currently no greater moneymaker than the strength of a paper\u2019s storytelling.</p> <p>Top papers know as much now: the Washington Post changed its tagline to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-washington-posts-new-slogan-turns-out-to-be-an-old-saying/2017/02/23/cb199cda-fa02-11e6-be05-1a3817ac21a5_story.html?utm_term=.e2c698ff411b\">Democracy dies in darkness</a>\u201d. And whereas the New York Times\u2019 publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr, had briefly weighed selling off even the paper\u2019s defining motto, \u201cAll the news that\u2019s fit to print\u201d, for ad space, now the paper brands itself as the Trump era\u2019s ultimate purveyor of truth.</p> <p>In her book, Abramson praised the Times\u2019 truth brand campaign, which debuted in 2017 and has <a href=\"https://www.ama.org/publications/MarketingNews/Pages/new-york-times-truth-campaign-drives-digital-subscriptions.aspx\">helped drive digital subscriptions</a>. \u201cThe slogan signaled a determination to hold Trump accountable,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe news report as a whole had never been stronger.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The truth is there isn\u2019t one business model that\u2019s going to save journalism. Great journalism is going to save journalism</p> <footer> <cite>Jill Abramson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Abramson\u2019s book is perhaps at its best as a transparency check on her former employer. At a time when many are asking <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/15/was-there-a-connection-between-a-russian-bank-and-the-trump-campaign\">how and why</a> the country\u2019s top journalistic outlet gravely mishandled a critical investigation into Trump\u2019s Russia ties, for instance, Abramson is quite possibly the most informed person free to speak her mind.</p> <p>As disturbing as it was to learn of the public editor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/public-editor/trump-russia-fbi-liz-spayd-public-editor.html\">internal review</a> finding that the paper could have published sooner and stronger on Trump\u2019s links with Russia was, an email Abramson details from top editor Dean Baquet \u2013 in which he appears angry his reporters spoke candidly about the paper\u2019s mistakes \u2013 is at least as troubling.</p> <p>Detractors would paint Abramson as a dinosaur at the end of its era, but from the vantage point of 2019, it seems Abramson saw the future best: that the Times and other top papers would survive not by the grace of creative concessions in advertising, but on the value of their news report.</p> <p>This moment also offers validation of a notion she\u2019s long seemed to possess: the idea that human beings are smart and complicated, that you can\u2019t hack them with formulas.</p> <p>\u201cThe truth is there isn\u2019t one business model that\u2019s going to save journalism. Great journalism is going to save journalism,\u201d she says. Then she makes her excuses, and puts down the phone.</p>",

One of those crises is, in a word, Donald Trump, specifically his assault on media and the fact-based world \u2013 so perhaps it was inevitable that the president himself would misrepresent her 400-plus page tome in a tweet. \u201cMs. Abramson is 100% correct. Horrible and totally dishonest reporting on almost everything they write,\u201d he wrote about the New York Times. Abramson\u2019s answer was swift. \u201cAnyone who reads my book, Merchants of Truth, will find I revere @nytimes and praise its tough coverage of you,\u201d she replied to Trump. If anything, the book\u2019s most salient takeaways on the matter are that the Times overemphasized Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and failed to move forward a critical investigation of her opponent. Though she also takes issue with the Times\u2019 tone, describing certain headlines and language as \u201canti-Trump\u201d. Nuanced criticism of media is fraught in the era of Trump, who will take any opening to mock the \u201cfailing New York Times\u201d, as he likes to call it. But the Times is currently thriving, thanks mostly \u2013 and perhaps ironically \u2013 to Trump. That wasn\u2019t true in the years leading up to 2011, when Abramson took the helm as its first female editor. Newspaper families, from Knight Ridder to Dow Jones, were calling it quits, and the Times\u2019 paywall blocking access to popular columnists had been an embarrassing flop. Nor had things stabilized in 2014 when, in the wake of her controversial firing, she set out in search of answers in the industry-wide quest for models of sustainable digital news. \u201cAt end of 2014, BuzzFeed and Vice were both envied by legacy companies \u2013 the shiny new stars that had just gotten recently into news,\u201d Abramson tells me. At first, it seemed internet natives like BuzzFeed were ahead of the game. But Trump\u2019s election and the attendant swell in subscribers at legacy outlets has turned the tables on that: at the turn of the millennium, Times subscriptions accounted for just 26% of total revenue; in August they accounted for nearly two-thirds of total revenue. \u201cThe key to being a good reporter is always being willing to be surprised when you\u2019re reporting a story,\u201d Abramson says with a laugh. \u201cI was.\u201d She meant surprised by the evolving story arc, but she\u2019s a damn good reporter too. Before becoming executive editor of the Times in 2011, Abramson was an investigative reporter covering the Clinton White House for the Wall Street Journal. And after supreme court justice Clarence Thomas was confirmed in 1991, she spent three years looking into sexual harassment allegations brought by Anita Hill, exposing the sexist inner workings of the Senate judiciary in an award-winning book co-written with the New Yorker\u2019s Jane Mayer. As a columnist at the Guardian, Abramson has also been a colleague of mine. When I met her while covering the Democratic national convention in 2016, I found her an intimidating presence to sit across from over lunch. By now, she\u2019s probably used to being seen that way. One colleague once memorably described her as having \u201cballs like cast-iron cantaloupes\u201d \u2013 a good makeup for investigative reporting but it sometimes got her in trouble in her years as top editor at the Times. A dogged defender of the separation of business and editorial \u2013 \u201cchurch and state\u201d, as she refers to them in the book \u2013 the paper\u2019s perilous financial straits did little to soften her disposition. When, for instance, at a lunch with top executives the paper\u2019s CEO, Mark Thompson, said he expected the newsroom to help generate ideas for revenue-increasing products, Abramson wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you expect, you have the wrong executive editor,\u201d she snapped. A shocked silence followed and the waiter spilled the water he was pouring. The retort \u201chad flown out of my mouth before I could edit either its substance or its tone\u201d, Abramson wrote in what, in retrospect, reads like an epitaph for her time at the Times, a moment that was the beginning of the end. But even where she was unwilling to compromise, she understood the depth of the financial threat. The trouble was, no one had the solution (even when many thought they did). At the time, BuzzFeed and Vice were being hailed as new-media heroes and legacy outlets sought to imitate them, with forays into native and branded advertising. \u201cIt was a response to real stresses in the business models that support all of these news organizations,\u201d Abramson says of the pivots that chafed her. \u201cThey are all doing things that were not done until the very end of my time at the Times.\u201d (The newspaper, Abramson notes in her book, \u201cstrongly disagrees\u201d with her view that business considerations have had too much influence on news coverage.) That Abramson is still working through her experience as a central player in a pivotal moment of news history is apparent in her writing on the Times. It\u2019s also where her insights are most powerful. But her criticisms of digital media companies and their discontents are sometimes misplaced where they land on individual young staffers, some of whom, like VICE\u2019s Arielle Duhaime-Ross, have said they were inaccurately represented. (Abramson addressed some of those claims, dismissively, in an interview with the New Yorker.) Nevertheless, in the five years since Abramson left the paper, a strange thing has begun to happen: the newcomers look increasingly like legacy outlets, even as legacy outlets mimicked them. They got interested in political scoops, started hiring top talent and forming investigative teams. They also started producing first-rate journalism, including BuzzFeed\u2019s groundbreaking coverage of fake news around the 2016 election, and Vice\u2019s footage of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia. But the newcomers had also begun to develop legacy media\u2019s money problems, as the platforms they built themselves atop tightened their grip over revenue. BuzzFeed built itself on the back of Facebook and its social sharing mechanisms, while Vice built itself on YouTube, owned by Google. But in recent years virtually all digital advertising has gone to profit Facebook and Google, while media companies fight for scraps. In her book, Abramson has tough words for just about everyone, herself included. But she saves the worst for the increasingly monopolistic companies many news outlets have come to depend upon. \u201cI really do think the villains are Facebook and Google,\u201d she says. Changes to their algorithms, or a faddish emphasis on video, can spell financial calamity for outlets big and small. Last month, Abramson declared it \u201cwinter\u201d for digital media after HuffPost announced a new round of terminations and BuzzFeed called for the elimination of 15% of staff. On 1 February, Vice axed 250 staffers. \u201cIt\u2019s live by it and die by it, I fear,\u201d Abramson says of using social media as your business model. \u201cYou know,\u201d she adds quickly, \u201cI hope none of these companies die.\u201d Still she doesn\u2019t think financial salvation is around the bend. In January, as an already beleaguered news industry suffered the loss of an additional 1,000 jobs nationally, Facebook announced the opening of its strongest year ever. Overall newsroom employment is down nearly a quarter in less than 10 years, according to a July report from the Pew Research Center. The most promising business trend to emerge is a growth in reader revenue, which has been a boon to the Times, the Washington Post, the Guardian, ProPublica and others. But only a handful of news brands have been able to make it work. Local and regional news organizations have been decimated in recent years, a reality Abramson sees as one of the central tragedies in journalism. Even if they could attract more reader revenue now, after rounds of being soldoff and stripped down for parts, few have the bones left to compete. In that light, perhaps, Abramson\u2019s formerly inconvenient commitment to old-school journalistic principles seems salient: there is currently no greater moneymaker than the strength of a paper\u2019s storytelling. Top papers know as much now: the Washington Post changed its tagline to \u201cDemocracy dies in darkness\u201d. And whereas the New York Times\u2019 publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr, had briefly weighed selling off even the paper\u2019s defining motto, \u201cAll the news that\u2019s fit to print\u201d, for ad space, now the paper brands itself as the Trump era\u2019s ultimate purveyor of truth. In her book, Abramson praised the Times\u2019 truth brand campaign, which debuted in 2017 and has helped drive digital subscriptions. \u201cThe slogan signaled a determination to hold Trump accountable,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe news report as a whole had never been stronger.\u201d Abramson\u2019s book is perhaps at its best as a transparency check on her former employer. At a time when many are asking how and why the country\u2019s top journalistic outlet gravely mishandled a critical investigation into Trump\u2019s Russia ties, for instance, Abramson is quite possibly the most informed person free to speak her mind. As disturbing as it was to learn of the public editor\u2019s internal review finding that the paper could have published sooner and stronger on Trump\u2019s links with Russia was, an email Abramson details from top editor Dean Baquet \u2013 in which he appears angry his reporters spoke candidly about the paper\u2019s mistakes \u2013 is at least as troubling. Detractors would paint Abramson as a dinosaur at the end of its era, but from the vantage point of 2019, it seems Abramson saw the future best: that the Times and other top papers would survive not by the grace of creative concessions in advertising, but on the value of their news report. This moment also offers validation of a notion she\u2019s long seemed to possess: the idea that human beings are smart and complicated, that you can\u2019t hack them with formulas. \u201cThe truth is there isn\u2019t one business model that\u2019s going to save journalism. Great journalism is going to save journalism,\u201d she says. Then she makes her excuses, and puts down the phone.",

Since the last big floods in 2006, Surat\u2019s geographical area has almost tripled to 326 sq km (126 sq miles). \u201cThe city used to exist only on one side of the river,\u201d Bhat says, \u201cbut it is now expanding on both sides, and there is little flood plain left.\u201d After the devastating floods of 2006, the municipal government set up an early warning system and started work building an embankment for the river. \u201cThe fire department does mock evacuation drills with schools and other institutions,\u201d says the, municipal commissioner M Thennarasan. \u201cOur website and mobile app have details of the water level in the Ukai dam. In case of an emergency, we can push warning messages to the people of Surat.\u201d These measures were put to the test in 2013 when the early warning system predicted heavy rain when the dam was already full. \u201cBecause we had an early idea, we decided to deplete the dam two days before the rainfall was expected,\u201d says Chaitanya Bhat, deputy municipal commissioner. \u201cOtherwise the dam authorities would have been compelled to release water and the city would have been flooded.\u201d Disaster was averted. But Gopalakrishna Bhat says Surat will only face ever bigger risks. In a 2013 paper he predicted the number of days with more than 200mm of rainfall would increase. \u201cThis would lead to the need for a greater number of emergency releases from the dam reservoir and increase the frequency and intensity of floods in Surat,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is estimated that around 90% of Surat\u2019s geographical area is affected by some type of climate hazard \u2013 whether flooding, coastal storms and cyclones or inundation associated with high tides and sea level rise. Much of the city and its surrounds are less than 10 metres above mean sea level.\u201d The dangers are compounded by the rapid expansion of Hazira, a port 15 miles from Surat built on reclaimed sections of flood plain, which has triggered major hydrological changes. The port has effectively narrowed the mouth of the Tapi where it meets the sea. \u201cThe large-scale industrial development at the mouth of the river causes a rise in the water level immediately upstream,\u201d Bhat\u2019s paper noted. The city has reached the stage where it must accept that future floods are inevitable, Bhat says. \u201cWe have to learn to live with the floods, and manage them in a way so our life is not disturbed too much.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here",

      "bodyText": "Italian prosecutors have controversially invited two high-ranking Sudanese officials to Sicily to testify in the case against a suspected human trafficker who appears to be the victim of mistaken identity. Magistrates in the case are relying on testimony from the alleged members of the feared secret police in Sudan, which is ruled by Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who has been charged with war crimes. The pair were allegedly part of a joint operation between Bashir\u2019s regime, the Italian police and the British National Crime Agency responsible for the 2016 arrest in Khartoum of a 35-year-old Eritrean who they alleged was Medhanie Yehdego Mered.

A documentary last year by the Swedish broadcaster SVT in collaboration with the Guardian concluded that Mered was \u201cliving it up\u201d in Uganda, while the suspect, a refugee whose name is Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe, faces up to 15 years in prison. DNA samples taken from Mered\u2019s three-year-old son and from Berhe\u2019s mother also suggest it is a case of mistaken identity. Although prosecutors have been unable to provide any witnesses to testify against him, they insist the man in custody is the real trafficker. To prove their case, they asked a judge to admit the testimony of the two Sudanese police officials who allegedly participated in the man\u2019s arrest and torture. On Monday, a judge in the Palermo criminal court accepted the prosecutors\u2019 request despite opposition from Berhe\u2019s lawyer, Michele Calantropo, who warned of the \u201cgrave ethical question\u201d that would be raised by their testimony. \u201cThe Sudanese police are considered the armed force of a cold-blooded dictator who now has two international arrest warrants in his name,\u201d Calantropo told the Guardian. \u201cMigrants\u2019 stories have been steadfast and unsettling on this point.

In July 2010, the court issued a second warrant containing three separate counts of genocide. On Transparency International\u2019s 2018 corruption perceptions index, Sudan ranked 172nd out of 183 countries. In his written statement in favour of acknowledging the prosecutors\u2019 request, the judge wrote that \u201cthe fact that in 2009 the ICC issued an arrest warrant in the Sudanese president\u2019s name is irrelevant and does not imply that its effects can be extended to all subjects who work for the Sudanese government, insofar as the Sudanese government has cooperated \u2013 and continues to cooperate \u2013 with international police forces.\u201d Amnesty International said the judge\u2019s decision was unacceptable for a democratic country. \u201cAny type of judicial collaboration between Italy and the Sudanese police is morally unacceptable,\u201d said Riccardo Noury, a spokesman for Amnesty in Italy. \u201cConsidering they\u2019ve invited members of his police force, why don\u2019t they extend their invitation to Bashir himself?

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. President plans to tout border security in postponed speech Donald Trump will mark the halfway point of his presidential term with an optimistic State of the Union address on Tuesday, touting the country\u2019s economic strength and border security and suggesting to a hostile, partisan Congress that \u201cwe can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions\u201d. The speech, delayed from 29 January due to the government shutdown, marks a distinct shift from the tone of Trump\u2019s inauguration address in 2017, when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress and he railed against what he called \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d. Inaugural committee. Federal prosecutors in New York have ordered the organisers of Trump\u2019s 2017 inauguration to hand over documents as part of a reported investigation into whether they received illegal donations from foreigners hoping to influence US policy. Former oil lobbyist to lead US interior department Trump has said he will nominate David Bernhardt, a former oil and gas lobbyist, to be the new US secretary of the interior. Bernhardt has been the department\u2019s acting secretary since Ryan Zinke stepped down at the end of last year following a string of scandals and alleged corruption. He is expected to continue Zinke\u2019s drive to allow oil and gas drilling and mining on or near public land, to the dismay of environmental groups. World Bank. Trump reportedly plans to nominate the Treasury official David Malpass to lead the World Bank. Malpass is notably sceptical of the global financial institution and its lending to developing countries. UN: North Korea protecting nuclear weapons from US strikes North Korea is taking steps to secure its nuclear program by dispersing its component parts to a variety of sites, including civilian airports, according to a confidential UN report. The report, by sanctions monitors, identified a \u201cconsistent trend\u201d by which the Kim regime was splitting up its missile \u201cassembly, storage and testing locations\u201d to guard against the threat of \u201cdecapitation strikes\u201d by the US, despite Trump\u2019s claim that \u201ctremendous progress\u201d has been made towards denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula. Nuclear diplomacy. Trump is expected to meet the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, for a second summit on denuclearisation at the end of this month. Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes sues anti-hate watchdog Gavin McInnes, the founder of Proud Boys, has filed a federal lawsuit against the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) for designating his organisation a \u201chate group\u201d. McInnes, also the co-founder of Vice Media, quit the Proud Boys last year after several members were prosecuted over a brawl in New York City and it was revealed the FBI had categorised it as \u201can extremist group with ties to white nationalism\u201d. But his complaint alleges the SPLC \u201ctargeted [McInnes] for personal and professional destruction\u201d. Denied entry. McInnes filed the lawsuit in Alabama, where the anti-hate watchdog is based, after he lost a broadcasting gig and was denied a visa to enter Australia. Crib sheet Police in Paris have detained a woman as part of an arson investigation, following a fire at a building in the French capital\u2019s 16th district on Monday night, in which at least 10 people died and 30 more were injured. The actor Liam Neeson has admitted in an interview that he once spent a week walking the streets with a cosh, hoping to be accosted by a black man so he could \u201ckill him\u201d in retaliation for the rape of a close friend by a black person. In the run-up to next month\u2019s national elections in Thailand, at least 10 men and five women have changed their names to those of former prime ministers, in the hope of being more memorable to voters. Taro Aso, the gaffe-prone deputy prime minister of Japan, has retracted comments in which he appeared to place the blame for the country\u2019s falling population on women for not \u201cgiving birth to children\u201d. Listen to Today in Focus: Underestimating climate change In today\u2019s podcast, David Wallace-Wells, the author of a new book, The Uninhabitable Earth, explains why he believes the effects of climate change are going to be far worse than we realise.

The family, who arrived in the UK in 2016, is considering a return to Correia\u2019s native Portugal where the air will be cleaner and Madalena may recover. \u201cWe came here because in Portugal there are not many jobs for nurses and we thought it would be a good life, but now? It is not easy because I will have to quit nursing but her life \u2026 her life is precious.\u201d The consultation at the Royal London hospital is being carried out by Prof Jonathan Grigg, one of the UK\u2019s leading specialists in respiratory illnesses in children. In the two hours the Guardian sits in on the session, there is a regular flow of parents and children into his room. The stories follow a pattern: babies and toddlers with severe wheezing episodes, older children with sometimes crippling asthma. Anxious parents are offered information and reassurance, a range of medicines are talked through and future appointments booked. One nine-year-old boy has had such a severe episode it triggered a heart attack and he must now use a wheelchair. A 20-month-old has been in and out of A&amp;E in the past few months and his father wants to know if he is in danger. Last year, figures from the Office for National Statistics revealed a record number of people were dying of asthma, with experts warning that air pollution and a lack of basic care could be to blame. As the consultations come to an end, Grigg, who set up the Doctors Against Diesel campaign and is a leading member of Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the patients\u2019 stories were all too familiar. And although, he said, it was impossible to ascribe air pollution as the sole cause in any individual case, the UK\u2019s filthy air \u201cis very severe and is a major driver of adverse respiratory effects\u201d. \u201cThe WHO said recently that air pollution is the new tobacco and I think, in terms of its impact on health, that is how we should think of it.\u201d Grigg says awareness of air pollution has grown significantly in recent years, with patients often ahead of the medical profession in terms of understanding. A growing number of people were asking him whether they should try to move house or school \u2013 or, as with Correia, move country \u2013 to avoid the impact of the UK\u2019s air pollution. \u201cI am wary of advising people because, hand on heart, I can\u2019t say their child will get better if they move and often people do not have that option. Rather, I advise them to come together with other parents and ask the school or the council what can be done, why there are so many cars on the roads outside their schools or homes \u2026 collective action seems better than trying to deal with this as individuals.\u201d The scale of the crisis has become more evident over recent months \u2013 especially its impact on children. Reports have emphasised the links between illegally poisonous air and heart disease, dementia, reduced cognitive ability and asthma deaths. Schools are becoming increasingly vocal, demanding that parents and children walk rather than use cars to get to and from school. Others are installing air purifiers in the classroom after growing concern around levels of indoor air pollution. Some regional politicians \u2013 Sadiq Khan in London and Andy Burnham in Manchester \u2013 are beginning to take action, although campaigners say the plans do not go far enough, fast enough, and many medics and environmentalists are increasingly exasperated with the government, which has lost three court cases over its perceived lack of action on air pollution. It is a sentiment shared by Grigg who says it is \u201ccrazy\u201d that ministers have still not taken decisive action to get the most polluting diesel vehicles off the road \u2013 even though they know the damage the vehicles are doing to the nation\u2019s health. But promises of action in the future may already be too late to persuade Correia \u2013 and thousands like her \u2013 to stay. \u201cWe did not think about pollution before we became parents,\u201d she says as she straps Madalena into a sling. \u201cBut now we are and we know about this, what else can we do?\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Award-winning author Tim Lott offers one-to-one mentoring to writers, whether you\u2019re working on your first draft, or your seventh novel. He offers several different packages, and shares with us each of these packages and why he thinks mentoring is essential for your confidence as a writer and, ultimately, your success.</p> <h2>Can you take us through the different tiers/types of mentoring you offer?</h2> <p>The most popular package I offer is for 10 mentoring sessions over the course of the year. The idea is that you submit 10 extracts of up to 7,500 words and at the end of the process, you have a novel-length piece of work.</p> <p>At the other end of the scale, I simply assess the manuscript that has already been written \u2013 reading the entire thing and making notes as I go, both within the text and separately, to then meet with the mentee and go through the notes, which are also forwarded at the end of the process.</p> <p>There are also a number of in-between options. For those who have started their novel, I read what has already been written \u2013 up to 40,000 words \u2013 critique it, and offer assistance with finishing the novel across six more sessions, with six extra submissions and readings.</p> <p>For those yet to get started, I work with them for six sessions to lay out the foundations of the novel, and then leave them to finish their book. When the manuscript is finished, I offer a final reading and assessment, and a further meeting to discuss what other work it needs.</p> <p>Finally, I offer an option for those who wish to simply get going \u2013 an extended face-to-face meeting and then five submissions and hourly sessions.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySOD_zcSlUc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ySOD_zcSlUc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=3\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Mentoring for writers with Tim Lott.</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>What sort of format does your mentoring take? How might it differ, for example, for writer getting started on their first book versus someone on their third? And for someone local versus a writer in the States?</h2> <p>The format is made up of reading submissions, then meeting to talk those submissions through in depth. There is really no difference when teaching a writer on their first book than someone on their third \u2013 all the same principles apply. Is the narrative clear? Does it move forward in a logical way? Do the characters have sufficient delineation? And how to the characters change \u2013 is they do change \u2013 through the course of the narrative? The same applies for whether the mentee is local or global \u2013 and incidentally I have many clients abroad, who I teach via Skype.</p> <h2>What can mentees expect from your mentoring that they can\u2019t find anywhere else?</h2> <p>There are very few mentors with the depth of experience I have, both as a writer \u2013 20 years as a published writer of YA, memoir and fiction, with multiple literary awards \u2013 and as a teacher \u2013 three years at the Faber Academy, five with The Guardian, and lecturing at the How To Academy, and UEA and Brunel University.</p> <p>I particularly pride myself on empathy and, most importantly, honesty. It is very easy to be a popular teacher just by offering encouragement and support. I do this, but also make sure I am crystal clear about what needs to be done and how your work can be concretely improved.</p> <p>I also give my own creative input into the process; rather than just teaching, I work with people to come with ideas and scenarios for what might happen next. My speciality is story \u2013 how to write a compelling narrative and how to work out the next developments in the action, as well as the more standard teaching around character, dialogue, style and so on. The fundamentals of storytelling are often neglecting by creative writing teachers in the way they would never be neglected by anyone teaching drama or screenwriting. I aim to remedy that lack for novelists.</p> <h2>What value do you think mentoring holds?</h2> <p>Tremendous value. It is very hard to get really good professional feedback as a writer. Writing groups are fine as far as writers go, and they can provide some emotional support, but as any professional editor will tell you, assessing the strengths and weaknesses of a narrative is a highly skilled task. And getting the sort of conflicting responses you might get in a writing group can be a source of confusion for writers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3aafb21fe0a0c6657f326a4441946e3aac6eae75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3aafb21fe0a0c6657f326a4441946e3aac6eae75/131_0_599_749/400.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Lott.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Lott.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Floyd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are also writing courses at colleges and universities, but they seem to require more time and detail than is actually necessary to write a novel. Formal lessons should be kept to a minimum, and should be highly personalised; each writer struggles with different aspects of the process. It is always easier to learn about writing fiction than it is to actually do it \u2013 and my emphasis is on the latter.</p> <p>Not only that, but mentors are often either editors or writers.

      "bodyText": "Award-winning author Tim Lott offers one-to-one mentoring to writers, whether you\u2019re working on your first draft, or your seventh novel. He offers several different packages, and shares with us each of these packages and why he thinks mentoring is essential for your confidence as a writer and, ultimately, your success. Can you take us through the different tiers/types of mentoring you offer? The most popular package I offer is for 10 mentoring sessions over the course of the year. The idea is that you submit 10 extracts of up to 7,500 words and at the end of the process, you have a novel-length piece of work. At the other end of the scale, I simply assess the manuscript that has already been written \u2013 reading the entire thing and making notes as I go, both within the text and separately, to then meet with the mentee and go through the notes, which are also forwarded at the end of the process. There are also a number of in-between options. For those who have started their novel, I read what has already been written \u2013 up to 40,000 words \u2013 critique it, and offer assistance with finishing the novel across six more sessions, with six extra submissions and readings. For those yet to get started, I work with them for six sessions to lay out the foundations of the novel, and then leave them to finish their book. When the manuscript is finished, I offer a final reading and assessment, and a further meeting to discuss what other work it needs. Finally, I offer an option for those who wish to simply get going \u2013 an extended face-to-face meeting and then five submissions and hourly sessions. What sort of format does your mentoring take? How might it differ, for example, for writer getting started on their first book versus someone on their third? And for someone local versus a writer in the States? The format is made up of reading submissions, then meeting to talk those submissions through in depth. There is really no difference when teaching a writer on their first book than someone on their third \u2013 all the same principles apply. Is the narrative clear? Does it move forward in a logical way? Do the characters have sufficient delineation? And how to the characters change \u2013 is they do change \u2013 through the course of the narrative? The same applies for whether the mentee is local or global \u2013 and incidentally I have many clients abroad, who I teach via Skype. What can mentees expect from your mentoring that they can\u2019t find anywhere else? There are very few mentors with the depth of experience I have, both as a writer \u2013 20 years as a published writer of YA, memoir and fiction, with multiple literary awards \u2013 and as a teacher \u2013 three years at the Faber Academy, five with The Guardian, and lecturing at the How To Academy, and UEA and Brunel University. I particularly pride myself on empathy and, most importantly, honesty. It is very easy to be a popular teacher just by offering encouragement and support. I do this, but also make sure I am crystal clear about what needs to be done and how your work can be concretely improved. I also give my own creative input into the process; rather than just teaching, I work with people to come with ideas and scenarios for what might happen next. My speciality is story \u2013 how to write a compelling narrative and how to work out the next developments in the action, as well as the more standard teaching around character, dialogue, style and so on. The fundamentals of storytelling are often neglecting by creative writing teachers in the way they would never be neglected by anyone teaching drama or screenwriting. I aim to remedy that lack for novelists. What value do you think mentoring holds? Tremendous value. It is very hard to get really good professional feedback as a writer. Writing groups are fine as far as writers go, and they can provide some emotional support, but as any professional editor will tell you, assessing the strengths and weaknesses of a narrative is a highly skilled task. And getting the sort of conflicting responses you might get in a writing group can be a source of confusion for writers. There are also writing courses at colleges and universities, but they seem to require more time and detail than is actually necessary to write a novel. Formal lessons should be kept to a minimum, and should be highly personalised; each writer struggles with different aspects of the process. It is always easier to learn about writing fiction than it is to actually do it \u2013 and my emphasis is on the latter. Not only that, but mentors are often either editors or writers. The former can be very good at identifying what might be wrong with a text, but do not necessarily possess the creative skills to move the story on. The latter may possess those creative skills, but may not have the editing skills to identify the specific problems with a manuscript. Can you share some of your favourite success stories? Many of my former mentees have posted on my blog. Obviously my favourite stories have come from writers who have achieved publication, including Ben McPherson, author of A Line of Blood, and Rebecca Thornton, author of The Exclusives \u2013 but I think every writer I have worked with has found it to be an enriching and valuable experience, as have I. I am also very proud of my tributes from great teachers such as John Yorke (Into the Woods) and Robert McKee (Story). Anything further you would like to add? I think there is a big difference between being a good writer and being a good teacher of writing. I have assiduously applied myself to this task over the past five years, read all of the literature and learned \u201con the job\u201d. Now I feel there\u2019s very little about the process of creation that I don\u2019t understand. The mentoring process may seem expensive when compared with some of the alternatives, but in the long term it will save both time and money \u2013 and above all, it will help you to exponentially improve your work. Also, acknowledging that it is a significant investment, I do offer my clients a get-out clause.

Kenny Jackett has no truck with that notion even if the match comes at a time when a promising campaign is at risk of unravelling.</p> <p>A month ago things were looking rosy for Pompey as they continue to make their way back from the ruins in which they found themselves in 2013 when, five years after seeing their team lift the FA Cup, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/10/portsmouth-future-fratton-park-ownership\" title=\"\">supporters had to rally round</a> to save the club from administration. Going into this year, Jackett\u2019s men were five points clear at the top of League One. But results have nosedived since and now they are seven points behind the leaders, Luton Town, and out of the automatic promotion spots.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2018/oct/10/portsmouth-buzz-back-football-league-blog\">How Portsmouth got the buzz back after years of misery | Ben Fisher</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Key players departed in January, notably the midfielder Ben Thompson, who was recalled from loan by Millwall. And injuries have afflicted others, with the club anxiously awaiting results of a scan on a knee of the centre-back Jack Whatmough. In such circumstances some managers would practically forfeit an FA Cup replay away to a side from a higher division. But not Jackett \u2013 and not just because beating QPR would set up a fifth-round date with Watford, his hometown club where he spent his entire playing career. The manager is convinced that advancing in the Cup can help rather than hinder Pompey.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t see it as a distraction,\u201d says the manager, whose side have also reached the semi-finals of the Checkatrade Trophy. \u201cFor the supporters and players the FA Cup is an exciting competition,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can get a great profile from it as a player and we\u2019ve had great attendances and backing in it from supporters, which shows you how they feel. And then the overall picture for the club is that if you have a Cup run, it can make a massive difference to the progression of your club financially. A Cup run can be a good percentage of your budget in League One and League Two. And a good result at QPR wouldn\u2019t do the players\u2019 confidence any harm.\u201d</p> <p>That confidence has taken a battering in recent weeks. But the manager, who knows a thing or three about promotions after guiding Swansea, Millwall and Wolves from League One to the Championship, remains upbeat. \u201cAt a big club you have to rise to the challenge,\u201d he says. Pompey are indeed a big club, with the average crowd at Fratton Park this season more than 18,000. Yet, as QPR will have noted as they prepare to host them, Pompey have won more points away than at home in the league this season: might the weight of expectation be too heavy?</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case,\u201d says Jackett. \u201cThe home crowd turn up wanting us to do well and they get behind us. [The difference in home and away results] is something we\u2019ve thought and talked about a lot but I can\u2019t categorically say there are one or two things we feel we\u2019ve done better away than at home.

      "bodyText": "Do not suggest to Portsmouth\u2019s manager that his team would be better off losing their FA Cup fourth\u2011round replay at Queens Park Rangers on Tuesday. Kenny Jackett has no truck with that notion even if the match comes at a time when a promising campaign is at risk of unravelling. A month ago things were looking rosy for Pompey as they continue to make their way back from the ruins in which they found themselves in 2013 when, five years after seeing their team lift the FA Cup, supporters had to rally round to save the club from administration. Going into this year, Jackett\u2019s men were five points clear at the top of League One. But results have nosedived since and now they are seven points behind the leaders, Luton Town, and out of the automatic promotion spots. Key players departed in January, notably the midfielder Ben Thompson, who was recalled from loan by Millwall. And injuries have afflicted others, with the club anxiously awaiting results of a scan on a knee of the centre-back Jack Whatmough. In such circumstances some managers would practically forfeit an FA Cup replay away to a side from a higher division. But not Jackett \u2013 and not just because beating QPR would set up a fifth-round date with Watford, his hometown club where he spent his entire playing career. The manager is convinced that advancing in the Cup can help rather than hinder Pompey. \u201cWe don\u2019t see it as a distraction,\u201d says the manager, whose side have also reached the semi-finals of the Checkatrade Trophy. \u201cFor the supporters and players the FA Cup is an exciting competition,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can get a great profile from it as a player and we\u2019ve had great attendances and backing in it from supporters, which shows you how they feel. And then the overall picture for the club is that if you have a Cup run, it can make a massive difference to the progression of your club financially. A Cup run can be a good percentage of your budget in League One and League Two. And a good result at QPR wouldn\u2019t do the players\u2019 confidence any harm.\u201d That confidence has taken a battering in recent weeks. But the manager, who knows a thing or three about promotions after guiding Swansea, Millwall and Wolves from League One to the Championship, remains upbeat. \u201cAt a big club you have to rise to the challenge,\u201d he says. Pompey are indeed a big club, with the average crowd at Fratton Park this season more than 18,000. Yet, as QPR will have noted as they prepare to host them, Pompey have won more points away than at home in the league this season: might the weight of expectation be too heavy? \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case,\u201d says Jackett. \u201cThe home crowd turn up wanting us to do well and they get behind us. [The difference in home and away results] is something we\u2019ve thought and talked about a lot but I can\u2019t categorically say there are one or two things we feel we\u2019ve done better away than at home. Sometimes there\u2019s a confidence in our defending away that isn\u2019t there at home.\u201d Pompey are one of the youngest teams in League One and the centre of their defence has been built on a pair of 22-year-olds, Matt Clarke and Whatmough. The latter\u2019s injury means Christian Burgess will be drafted in. Replacing the departed Thompson in midfield is a challenge. \u201cIt\u2019s about working as combinations,\u201d says Jackett. \u201cMuch as we\u2019d like somebody to build into the influence that Ben had, as a unit we want to be as strong as we possibly can in there.\u201d The four loanees who arrived in January are not eligible to play at Loftus Road but Jackett hopes that attackers such as Omar Bogle, James Vaughan and Viv-Solomon Otabor will make a big impact. \u201cAre we stronger in the second half [of the season] than in the first? The proof will be in the pudding,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s up to myself to point them all in the right direction.\u201d Five years ago his Wolves team clambered out of a mid-season rut to win 17 of their last 21 matches and top League One with a record points tally. \u201cWe\u2019ll need that type of run here,\u201d he says. \u201cTo win things you need a sprint finish.

      "bodyText": "Liverpool may be top of the table for now, but much more of the uninspired bilge they served up at West Ham yesterday and instead of preparing for open-top bus tours they will be planning a Europa League campaign this summer. Clearly clever J\u00fcrgen Klopp has already worked out that his attack requires significant investment, which is why someone had a quiet word in the ear of super-agent Mino Raiola, aimed at discerning the availability of one of his clients, a certain Lorenzo Insigne. Liverpool were ready, they said, to lavish \u00a361m (\u20ac70m) on the Napoli forward, but didn\u2019t want to approach the Partenopei\u2019s chairman, Aurelio De Laurentiis, in case he shouted at them. Raiola clearly felt the same way, because apparently he spoke in turn to the player\u2019s father Carmine, but eventually word finally filtered down to De Laurentiis. He, according to La Repubblica, replied that the 27-year-old was worth considerably more than that, but he might accept a bid of \u20ac150m. This has not, the paper warns, put anyone off, and further discussions are expected, with the player\u2019s decision to join Raiola\u2019s stable late last year seen as something of a come-and-negotiate-me-a-massive-transfer plea. How Unai Emery must wish for some of that spending power, with his summer Arsenal-rebuilding war chest amounting to just \u00a340m, according to the Mirror. With the deal already in place to make Denis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s loan move permanent set to eat up almost half of that, a meagre \u00a322m will be left over to reshape the team\u2019s struggling defence, enough for 29% of a Virgil van Dijk. The Sun adds that this sum could be boosted to \u00a360m if he manages to qualify for the Champions League, with which he would like, they say, five players - \u201ctwo wingers, a couple of full-backs and at least one centre-back\u201d. The Mail, slightly more encouragingly, says he will have \u00a345m and only wants \u201cat least three players including a left-back\u201d.

Bayern Munich will resume their Callum Hudson-Odoi chase in the summer, with their chairman, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, saying that their sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic had \u201cpractically fallen in love with this player on account of his quality.

He then progresses into some highfalutin gum-flapping about \u201corigin and essence\u201d, but the instant <a href=\"https://me.me/i/critique-is-so-limiting-and-emotionally-draining-netflix-when-you-e0ecea77a9cd4c2e91f6c577878eb323\">memehood</a> of this particular snippet from the trailer suggests that those first words resonate with the critical press back on Earth. To find success as a critic, you\u2019ve got to have skin in the game, and Velvet Buzzsaw flays that skin from the bone in gory, over-the-top fashion. Morf has invested so much of himself in art that he lets it literally kill him, and anyone mad enough to commit their being to the craft of criticism has felt a metaphorical approximation of the same.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/28/velvet-buzzsaw-review-netflix-art-world-horror-is-flawed-but-fun\">Velvet Buzzsaw review \u2013 Netflix art world horror is flawed but fun</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the film <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/movies/2019/2/1/18206684/velvet-buzzsaw-netflix-jake-gyllenhaal-review\">has its shortcomings</a>, Dan Gilroy\u2019s latest gets at a dimension of the critical mentality that many onscreen depictions of the profession haven\u2019t. By building the film around his perspective, Gilroy reserves a measure of sympathy for a character who doesn\u2019t inspire much of that in the people around him. In moments, Morf can be as contemptible as any of the more thinly written dream-destroyers ginned up by resentful creators, but at least we can see a human being behind the cutting bons mots.</p> <p>The dominant illustration of the typical critic originates from an artist\u2019s defensive crouch. Haughty, pretentious and often objectively wrong, they provide a slate on to which anyone who\u2019s ever felt misunderstood or personally wronged by a reviewer can project their aggravations and insecurities. Following the mixed response to The Village in 2004, M Night Shyamalan inserted the fatuous Harry Farber (played by Bob Balaban in a clear nod to legendary scribbler Manny Farber) into the script for Lady in the Water, a critic who constantly misreads the symbols left by genius author Vick Ran (portrayed by Shyamalan himself, in case his vendettas hadn\u2019t been made clear enough).</p> <p>The very worst scene of 2014\u2019s Birdman \u2013 excepting the one in which Michael Keaton must sneer through the word \u201cviral\u201d \u2013 comes when a vicious theater critic confirms all of actor Riggan Thomson\u2019s worst suspicions and admits that she wants only to see him fail. When she furtively tells him that she had readied her pan before seeing one minute of his new play, she confirms all of the worst suspicions artists hold for their loyal opposition. In my personal experience alone, I have discovered that a truly bewildering number of performers and directors believe this same thing: that critics are nothing more than wannabe directors who desire nothing more than to destroy the art that they couldn\u2019t make themselves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"476086a62851f73cc3068701ea632913ff1f1412\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/476086a62851f73cc3068701ea632913ff1f1412/0_106_2205_1323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bette Davis, Marilyn Monroe and George Sanders in All About Eve.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bette Davis, Marilyn Monroe and George Sanders in All About Eve.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/20 Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We land somewhat closer to the mark with the great Addison DeWitt, who pairs the acidic qualities of the screen critic with the expertise and wit of his real-world counterparts. With 1950\u2019s All About Eve, George Sanders earned the Academy Award for playing the role as jury and executioner to Broadway, the kind of critic so influential that one word could make or break a career. (Morf also wields this degree of absolute power over his field, though it made a bit more sense in the pre-internet era. No amount of <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2014/09/25/cult-jeff-koons/\">searing takedowns</a> will stop Jeff Koons.) He\u2019s a talented, rigorously studied stylist with words \u2013 and fundamentally evil, blackmailing ingenue Eve with her own ersatz past in order to keep her under his thumb.</p> <p>For all the scheming and malice, the most accurately written critic in the annals of fiction has to be Jay Sherman, our protagonist in the short-lived but cult-beloved 90s sitcom The Critic.

      "bodyText": "\u201cCritique is so limiting and emotionally draining.\u201d So laments Morf Vanderwalt, the chin-stroking art critic portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal in the new Netflix thriller Velvet Buzzsaw. He then progresses into some highfalutin gum-flapping about \u201corigin and essence\u201d, but the instant memehood of this particular snippet from the trailer suggests that those first words resonate with the critical press back on Earth. To find success as a critic, you\u2019ve got to have skin in the game, and Velvet Buzzsaw flays that skin from the bone in gory, over-the-top fashion. Morf has invested so much of himself in art that he lets it literally kill him, and anyone mad enough to commit their being to the craft of criticism has felt a metaphorical approximation of the same. While the film has its shortcomings, Dan Gilroy\u2019s latest gets at a dimension of the critical mentality that many onscreen depictions of the profession haven\u2019t. By building the film around his perspective, Gilroy reserves a measure of sympathy for a character who doesn\u2019t inspire much of that in the people around him. In moments, Morf can be as contemptible as any of the more thinly written dream-destroyers ginned up by resentful creators, but at least we can see a human being behind the cutting bons mots. The dominant illustration of the typical critic originates from an artist\u2019s defensive crouch. Haughty, pretentious and often objectively wrong, they provide a slate on to which anyone who\u2019s ever felt misunderstood or personally wronged by a reviewer can project their aggravations and insecurities. Following the mixed response to The Village in 2004, M Night Shyamalan inserted the fatuous Harry Farber (played by Bob Balaban in a clear nod to legendary scribbler Manny Farber) into the script for Lady in the Water, a critic who constantly misreads the symbols left by genius author Vick Ran (portrayed by Shyamalan himself, in case his vendettas hadn\u2019t been made clear enough). The very worst scene of 2014\u2019s Birdman \u2013 excepting the one in which Michael Keaton must sneer through the word \u201cviral\u201d \u2013 comes when a vicious theater critic confirms all of actor Riggan Thomson\u2019s worst suspicions and admits that she wants only to see him fail. When she furtively tells him that she had readied her pan before seeing one minute of his new play, she confirms all of the worst suspicions artists hold for their loyal opposition. In my personal experience alone, I have discovered that a truly bewildering number of performers and directors believe this same thing: that critics are nothing more than wannabe directors who desire nothing more than to destroy the art that they couldn\u2019t make themselves. We land somewhat closer to the mark with the great Addison DeWitt, who pairs the acidic qualities of the screen critic with the expertise and wit of his real-world counterparts. With 1950\u2019s All About Eve, George Sanders earned the Academy Award for playing the role as jury and executioner to Broadway, the kind of critic so influential that one word could make or break a career. (Morf also wields this degree of absolute power over his field, though it made a bit more sense in the pre-internet era. No amount of searing takedowns will stop Jeff Koons.) He\u2019s a talented, rigorously studied stylist with words \u2013 and fundamentally evil, blackmailing ingenue Eve with her own ersatz past in order to keep her under his thumb. For all the scheming and malice, the most accurately written critic in the annals of fiction has to be Jay Sherman, our protagonist in the short-lived but cult-beloved 90s sitcom The Critic. He bears a far greater resemblance to reality as my esteemed peers and I understand it today: he\u2019s unattractive, unimportant, neurotic and prone to the occasional fit of grouchiness. But his seeming misanthropy comes from a deep-seated love of the cinema, a disgust stemming from being forced to watch an industry capable of great things slum it. This show grasps a higher truth that continues to elude so many actual artists: that surveying the full breadth of a medium necessitates harshness and negativity, if only to keep bona fide excellence in perspective. Devotion connects Jay Sherman to Morf, and the actuality of the critic\u2019s work with the artist\u2019s impression of it. While Morf may be wealthier and more implausibly handsome than any critic working today, he\u2019s defined by his obsessive relationship to the work. Everywhere he goes, stung subjects of his past essays spit his most withering lines back in his face; to the extent that Velvet Buzzsaw is a horror movie, it is about the horror of being consumed by the very thing a good critic must let themselves be consumed by. The most harrowing scene traps Morf in a soundbooth, where he\u2019s plagued by auditory hallucinations of cutting wordplay from past reviews.

As Morrison signalled executives of the National Australia Bank should reflect on Kenneth Hayne\u2019s \u201csharp\u201d assessment of their conduct, Shorten wrote to the prime minister on Tuesday, declaring it was critical the reforms be legislated as soon as possible, and demanding two extra sitting weeks be scheduled in March. \u201cAfter taking so long to recognise a royal commission was necessary, Australians will not accept any further delaying tactics from your government,\u201d the Labor leader said. But a spokesman for Morrison dismissed the call, saying there was already legislation in the parliament dealing with substantive issues flagged by the royal commission, \u201cbut Bill Shorten and Labor have been fighting it tooth and nail\u201d. \u201cWe won\u2019t be lectured by Bill Shorten who still hasn\u2019t outlined which recommendations Labor would implement,\u201d the spokesman said. The intensifying political brawl, and Morrison\u2019s pointed public rebuke to National Australia Bank executives, comes as big bank stocks surged as investors and their advisers absorbed the recommendations of the Hayne report and the government\u2019s response. The positive market reaction, with the major banks up between 3.9 and 7.4% in the day\u2019s trade, suggests the Hayne report has been greeted with relief, and it suggests the financial services sector feared a much more radical overhaul. While the sharemarket fallout for the banks was positive, it was a different story for mortgage brokers, with the market moving in the opposite direction. As a consequence of the royal commission, brokers will be subjected to a \u201cbest interests\u201d duty and trailing commissions will be banned from July 2020 \u2013 but the Morrison government has stopped short of adopting a users pays recommendation where borrowers, not lenders, should pay mortgage brokers a fee for acting in connection with home lending. Labor has blasted the government\u2019s failure to implement that recommendation in full. Reports in December suggest the assistant treasurer, Stuart Robert, gave the broking industry some comfort last December, ahead of the final Hayne report, with Robert giving an impression that current practices didn\u2019t need to change much. Despite winning the partial reprieve, the broking sector is furious with the Hayne recommendations. The Finance Brokers Association of Australia managing director, Peter White, declared on Tuesday the reforms \u201cwould send Australia back to the dark ages where a few banks held all the power\u201d. With senior government figures under pressure to apologise for failing to call the royal commission sooner, the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull also surfaced to note the government \u201cshould have got on with it earlier\u201d. While the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, declined to apologise in several interviews, Morrison, visiting flood damaged areas in Townsville, repeated a formulation about regret that he offered last year. He told reporters he \u201cexpressed my regret last year and I meant it\u201d but he said the government had \u201cjust got on\u201d with setting up the royal commission, and ensuring the recommendations were implemented. With the National Australia Bank also under significant pressure, given Hayne\u2019s scathing assessment of the chief executive, Andrew Thorburn, and the chairman, Ken Henry, the prime minister also pointed the finger squarely at the executive team. \u201cCommissioner Hayne was pretty sharp in his assessment and I think that gives them a lot to reflect on.\u201d Morrison said he would be so \u201cbold\u201d as to suggest their positions were now untenable but he repeated the observation that Hayne had been \u201csharp\u201d. With the government keen to draw a line with the final report, and move on, Labor is also intensifying criticism about the government\u2019s response to the final report. The shadow financial services minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, says the government is keen to convey an impression that it has accepted all the Hayne recommendations, but closer analysis of the government response suggests that is not the case. As well as the partial reprieve for mortgage brokers, she points to equivocal responses in relation to recommendations that the law be amended to provide Asic with additional powers to approve and enforce industry code provisions, and a lack of commitment to duty of care recommendations for the insurance industry. O\u2019Neil says the government has not committed to replace the current duty of disclosure with a duty to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation, as recommended by Hayne. \u201cThat is the substance of this recommendation, and the government has indicated that they will not do it,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "Australian authorities must plan for more severe floods, experts have warned, amid concern that the management of the Townsville Ross River dam contributed to extensive flooding when a massive amount of water was released downstream. The decision to open the floodgates when the dam water level reached 43m was based on a 2012 study that warned doing so could cause more extensive property damage during the most extreme flooding events. The dam\u2019s spillway gates were fully opened late on Sunday night, just before the dam level peaked at 42.97m, and in line with a current management plan. About 1,900 cubic metres of water a second gushed into the Ross River and ultimately into low-lying Townsville suburbs, where residents had to be evacuated. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said on Monday the floodgates had to be opened \u201cto make sure the water had somewhere to go\u201d. Some residents have expressed anger that water was allowed to build for so long, rather than be released more steadily during the previous week of continued heavy monsoonal rain. The Northern Water Management study, commissioned by the Townsville council in 2012, underscores the almost impossible nature of such policy decisions; saving homes on one flood scenario, causing more extensive damage in another. The previous trigger for the Ross River Dam floodgates to be fully opened was 41.75m. Modelling for a one in 100-year flood scenario under the previous trigger predicted 960 properties in Townsville would be flood affected.

Based on the rate of water coming from the dam spillway on Sunday night, about 1,900 cubic metres a second, the study rated this week\u2019s unprecedented monsoonal rainfall as comparable to about a one in 1,000 year flood. Australian National University professor Jamie Pittock said authorities in Australia typically made planning and flood management decisions based on the \u201cone in 100\u201d year designation.

The couple, aged 80 and 77, have lived in the Townsville suburb of Idalia for nine years. The houses on the opposite side of the street back on to the Ross River but have never been affected by flooding. Within hours, the river burst its banks. As the flood waters hurtled towards Townsville\u2019s low-lying suburbs from the Ross River dam, uncertainty and fear spread across a community struggling with what has been described as \u201can unprecedented monsoonal burst\u201d. Forty-eight hours later, walking back into their home on Tuesday morning, the Landmans have to steady themselves. First there is the apprehension, about the condition of their home and belongings. Then there is the slippery mud, about an inch deep, covering the once-white tiles. \u201cAt least we can\u2019t get it any dirtier,\u201d Sue says as she walks carefully inside. She checks on old family photos and important papers. Harry is concerned about his car; he manages to get the old one running but the new car won\u2019t start. \u201cAll our files and everything are gone,\u201d Sue says. \u201cBut what can you do?\u201d A few streets away, their daughter Dana, and granddaughters Paije and Belle, are also trying to salvage belongings. The flood waters were forceful enough to knock over an old fridge. The girls find baby photos undamaged but books and furniture and appliances are wrecked. Dana says she thought her home would be safe; that they were not given sandbags because they were further from the Ross River. But the water appears to have carved channels along the suburb\u2019s streets and left few homes untouched. The experience can be upsetting. \u201cI don\u2019t care anymore,\u201d Dana says. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing valuable here left.\u201d North Queensland remains covered by the grey spectre of an unmoving monsoon trough but Monday night provided a reprieve of sorts.

An opening weekend victory against Italy is not always a sure indicator of impending glory but facing the Scots at Murrayfield is not the kind of prospect to ease Ireland back into the groove after their England disappointment. Let\u2019s just say Finn Russell and Stuart Hogg carve it up and Scotland catch France on an off-day in Paris: what a final fortnight of Six Nations intrigue would then await. Ireland will be on the rebound but an Edinburgh ambush is far from impossible.</p> \n<h2>One to watch</h2> \n<p>Anyone who saw England\u2019s women beat Ireland 51-7 on Saturday will know Eddie Jones\u2019s team are not the only strong and improving Red Rose squad around just now. This Sunday could well supply their biggest test when they meet France, potentially their main title rivals, at Castle Park in Doncaster. If England\u2019s 21-year-old prop Sarah Bern, in particular, has as eye-catching a game she had against Ireland, it will be well worth the price of admission.</p>",

Maybe there is a little subliminal message for this weekend in there somewhere. And the third London flashback? France\u2019s truly remarkable performance at Wembley in 1998 when they annihilated Wales 51-0 to clinch the last back-to-back championship grand slam any nation has achieved. Thomas Castaign\u00e8de, St\u00e9phane Glas, Christophe Lamaison, Rapha\u00ebl Iba\u00f1ez, Olivier Magne \u2026 what would France give for even a soup\u00e7on of their old-school excellence now? Magne, as it happens, has been extremely outspoken following the defeat by Wales, calling for France to trust in youth and suggesting \u201cwe won\u2019t win anything with the current generation\u201d. He also believes the psychology of several established players is all wrong. \u201cWhen I hear some players after games, it\u2019s never their fault. At the first hitch, they collapse psychologically. This generation has been associated with defeat for too long \u2026 they are deeply traumatised.\u201d If ever there was a moment for Les Bleus to awake from their creative coma and channel their inner Asterix it is now. Tartan terrors Talking of anniversaries it is also 20 years ago that Scotland last won a championship title. An opening weekend victory against Italy is not always a sure indicator of impending glory but facing the Scots at Murrayfield is not the kind of prospect to ease Ireland back into the groove after their England disappointment. Let\u2019s just say Finn Russell and Stuart Hogg carve it up and Scotland catch France on an off-day in Paris: what a final fortnight of Six Nations intrigue would then await. Ireland will be on the rebound but an Edinburgh ambush is far from impossible. One to watch Anyone who saw England\u2019s women beat Ireland 51-7 on Saturday will know Eddie Jones\u2019s team are not the only strong and improving Red Rose squad around just now. This Sunday could well supply their biggest test when they meet France, potentially their main title rivals, at Castle Park in Doncaster. If England\u2019s 21-year-old prop Sarah Bern, in particular, has as eye-catching a game she had against Ireland, it will be well worth the price of admission.",

Yet the state, through a number of government departments, pays private schools, including some of the best known and wealthiest in the country, more than \u00a3200m a year.</p> <p>Half of this subsidy goes on the \u201ccontinuity of education allowance\u201d, under which diplomats or military personnel can apply to have their children\u2019s fees paid at, for example, Eton or Marlborough College.</p> <p><a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/757930/01793.pdf\" title=\"\">Figures for 2017</a> show that the Ministry of Defence spent \u00a380m a year so that the children of senior military officers could attend elite public schools. The costs are not small. For example, Tony Blair\u2019s old school, Fettes, was paid \u00a3441,027 and Eton almost \u00a3270,000. While the overall annual figure of \u00a380m remains almost unchanged from previous years, Eton, Harrow (\u00a3183,000), Marlborough College (\u00a3346,000) and Shrewsbury School (\u00a3231,000) have all enjoyed bumper years, seeing increased MoD payments.</p> <p>The Foreign Office runs a similar scheme for diplomats. A parliamentary question answered in <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2018-11-27/196151\" title=\"\">November last year</a> revealed that \u00a327m of taxpayers\u2019 money was spent on the school fees of diplomats\u2019 children in 2017. Sevenoaks School in Kent alone received almost \u00a3500,000. </p> <p>The purpose of the two schemes is to ensure that children of diplomats and the military top brass do not suffer from a disrupted education when their parents are serving abroad. But closer scrutiny of government figures reveals that almost half of the personnel who benefit have UK-based jobs. And because participant families must pay part of the fees themselves, most ordinary soldiers can\u2019t afford to join the scheme. This means that it is almost exclusively the senior officer and diplomatic corps whose children get to go to the elite expensive schools like Eton, Harrow and Marlborough College.</p> <p>Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, who asked the Commons question, says: \u201cAt a time when per-pupil funding for state secondary schools is stuck at just over \u00a36,000 per year, and headteachers are having to send begging letters to parents to buy basic supplies, it seems extraordinary that the Foreign Office is funding the private education of its staff\u2019s children to the tune of more than \u00a330,000 per pupil every year. That level of subsidy is hard to justify at a time when the ordinary schools budget is under such pressure.\u201d</p> <p>Private schools also benefit from the government\u2019s music and dance scheme (MDS), an annual fund established to help \u201censure that talented children and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds and families with limited financial means\u201d have the opportunity to attend one of eight independent music or dance schools.</p> <p>The scheme, which in 2017 paid private schools \u00a331m in fees, was recently accused of contributing to arts elitism. Figures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/oct/02/music-school-grants-poor-middle-class-yehudi-menuhin-chethams\" title=\"\">obtained by the Guardian</a> showed that, despite the aim to help disadvantaged young people, families earning up to \u00a3190,000 a year are receiving awards. Critics point to the substantial number of MDS award holders who come from independent prep schools.</p> <p>Given the huge advantages that private schools have over their state counterparts, is it fair that they also receive \u00a3200m in direct subsidies and \u00a32.5bn in tax breaks?</p> <p>Robert Halfon, the chairman of the House of Commons education select committee and a former pupil of Highgate School in north London, says that because there are too few state boarding schools to accommodate military children, the government has little choice but to support the private sector. \u201cChildren need a stable and continuous education while their parents are away,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the case of the military, these children may not even know if their parent is ever coming home again.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/13/public-schools-david-kynaston-francis-green-engines-of-privilege\">Britain\u2019s private school problem: it\u2019s time to talk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nevertheless, Halfon understands the resentment taxpayers might feel towards subsidising fee-paying schools. He says: \u201cIf private schools gave more genuinely disadvantaged children the chance of a public-school education then people wouldn\u2019t mind arrangements where the state pays fees of some middle-class children,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Halfon believes there should be a sliding scale of tax on all private schools. \u201cAt the moment bursary schemes tend to help children of relatively well-off families. Which is OK, but they also need to do more for genuinely disadvantaged children.\u201d He proposes introducing a \u201clevy\u201d, akin to an apprenticeship scheme, to ensure \u201cthat kids from, say, a Harlow estate, have a chance to go to these schools\u201d. He adds: \u201cLower-charging private schools would only have to apply a levy relative and in proportion to their annual fees.\u201d</p> <p>Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, is also pressing for reform. \u201cThe Tories should have stuck to their own manifesto pledge and looked again at tax giveaways to private schools,\u201d she says. \u201cWhile the vast majority of schools face the worst budget cuts in a generation, ministers have taken no meaningful action on subsidies for the few that are run for private profit.\u201d</p> <p>Private schools themselves, which receive about \u00a39bn in fees each year, argue that they already provide a \u00a33.5bn saving to the state by educating more than 600,000 children outside of the state system. Julie Robinson, the general secretary of the Independent Schools Council, which represents private schools, says that subsidies, such as the music and dance scheme, support \u201cmany talented children who would otherwise not have had the opportunity to attend a full-time vocational establishment\u201d.</p> <p>Through bursaries and reduced fees, private schools \u201care increasingly widening access to lower-income families and disadvantaged children\u201d, she adds.</p> <p>But change has been glacial. Despite all this help, including state subsidies, today only 1% of children (6,000 pupils) attending private schools receive a completely free education.</p> <p>Professor Francis Green, of the UCL Institute of Education and co-author of Engines of Privilege, a new book about \u201cthe private-school problem\u201d, has found that private schools are not as charitable as they make out. \u201cOnly 4% of private school turnover is devoted to bursaries, and only 1% of private school pupils get to go for free. Some rich schools do better than this, but overall there is no evidence of bursaries and scholarships becoming more generous, or more progressively channelled towards low-income families in recent years.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Robert Verkaik is the author of </em><em>Posh Boys: How the English Public Schools Ruin Britain</em></p>",

As charities, Thomas\u2019s and the other participating schools are under a legal duty to make a contribution to the community. Yet the state, through a number of government departments, pays private schools, including some of the best known and wealthiest in the country, more than \u00a3200m a year. Half of this subsidy goes on the \u201ccontinuity of education allowance\u201d, under which diplomats or military personnel can apply to have their children\u2019s fees paid at, for example, Eton or Marlborough College. Figures for 2017 show that the Ministry of Defence spent \u00a380m a year so that the children of senior military officers could attend elite public schools. The costs are not small. For example, Tony Blair\u2019s old school, Fettes, was paid \u00a3441,027 and Eton almost \u00a3270,000. While the overall annual figure of \u00a380m remains almost unchanged from previous years, Eton, Harrow (\u00a3183,000), Marlborough College (\u00a3346,000) and Shrewsbury School (\u00a3231,000) have all enjoyed bumper years, seeing increased MoD payments. The Foreign Office runs a similar scheme for diplomats. A parliamentary question answered in November last year revealed that \u00a327m of taxpayers\u2019 money was spent on the school fees of diplomats\u2019 children in 2017. Sevenoaks School in Kent alone received almost \u00a3500,000. The purpose of the two schemes is to ensure that children of diplomats and the military top brass do not suffer from a disrupted education when their parents are serving abroad. But closer scrutiny of government figures reveals that almost half of the personnel who benefit have UK-based jobs. And because participant families must pay part of the fees themselves, most ordinary soldiers can\u2019t afford to join the scheme. This means that it is almost exclusively the senior officer and diplomatic corps whose children get to go to the elite expensive schools like Eton, Harrow and Marlborough College. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, who asked the Commons question, says: \u201cAt a time when per-pupil funding for state secondary schools is stuck at just over \u00a36,000 per year, and headteachers are having to send begging letters to parents to buy basic supplies, it seems extraordinary that the Foreign Office is funding the private education of its staff\u2019s children to the tune of more than \u00a330,000 per pupil every year. That level of subsidy is hard to justify at a time when the ordinary schools budget is under such pressure.\u201d Private schools also benefit from the government\u2019s music and dance scheme (MDS), an annual fund established to help \u201censure that talented children and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds and families with limited financial means\u201d have the opportunity to attend one of eight independent music or dance schools. The scheme, which in 2017 paid private schools \u00a331m in fees, was recently accused of contributing to arts elitism. Figures obtained by the Guardian showed that, despite the aim to help disadvantaged young people, families earning up to \u00a3190,000 a year are receiving awards. Critics point to the substantial number of MDS award holders who come from independent prep schools. Given the huge advantages that private schools have over their state counterparts, is it fair that they also receive \u00a3200m in direct subsidies and \u00a32.5bn in tax breaks? Robert Halfon, the chairman of the House of Commons education select committee and a former pupil of Highgate School in north London, says that because there are too few state boarding schools to accommodate military children, the government has little choice but to support the private sector. \u201cChildren need a stable and continuous education while their parents are away,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the case of the military, these children may not even know if their parent is ever coming home again.\u201d Nevertheless, Halfon understands the resentment taxpayers might feel towards subsidising fee-paying schools. He says: \u201cIf private schools gave more genuinely disadvantaged children the chance of a public-school education then people wouldn\u2019t mind arrangements where the state pays fees of some middle-class children,\u201d he says. Halfon believes there should be a sliding scale of tax on all private schools. \u201cAt the moment bursary schemes tend to help children of relatively well-off families. Which is OK, but they also need to do more for genuinely disadvantaged children.\u201d He proposes introducing a \u201clevy\u201d, akin to an apprenticeship scheme, to ensure \u201cthat kids from, say, a Harlow estate, have a chance to go to these schools\u201d. He adds: \u201cLower-charging private schools would only have to apply a levy relative and in proportion to their annual fees.\u201d Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, is also pressing for reform. \u201cThe Tories should have stuck to their own manifesto pledge and looked again at tax giveaways to private schools,\u201d she says. \u201cWhile the vast majority of schools face the worst budget cuts in a generation, ministers have taken no meaningful action on subsidies for the few that are run for private profit.\u201d Private schools themselves, which receive about \u00a39bn in fees each year, argue that they already provide a \u00a33.5bn saving to the state by educating more than 600,000 children outside of the state system. Julie Robinson, the general secretary of the Independent Schools Council, which represents private schools, says that subsidies, such as the music and dance scheme, support \u201cmany talented children who would otherwise not have had the opportunity to attend a full-time vocational establishment\u201d. Through bursaries and reduced fees, private schools \u201care increasingly widening access to lower-income families and disadvantaged children\u201d, she adds. But change has been glacial. Despite all this help, including state subsidies, today only 1% of children (6,000 pupils) attending private schools receive a completely free education. Professor Francis Green, of the UCL Institute of Education and co-author of Engines of Privilege, a new book about \u201cthe private-school problem\u201d, has found that private schools are not as charitable as they make out. \u201cOnly 4% of private school turnover is devoted to bursaries, and only 1% of private school pupils get to go for free. Some rich schools do better than this, but overall there is no evidence of bursaries and scholarships becoming more generous, or more progressively channelled towards low-income families in recent years.\u201d \u2022 Robert Verkaik is the author of Posh Boys: How the English Public Schools Ruin Britain",

Producing the Guardian\u2019s independent, in-depth journalism takes time and money. We do it because we believe our perspective matters, and it may be yours too. If you value our Brexit coverage, please support us. Thank you. Top stories Well, fancy that. Having crushed Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal in the heaviest defeat for a government in UK parliamentary history, MPs voted by a narrow margin to resuscitate it after she gave in to Conservative hardliners and promised to return to Brussels in search of changes to the Irish backstop. The Brady amendment, which aims to replace the backstop with unspecified \u201calternative arrangements\u201d, passed by 317 votes to 301, with May pledging to try to bring back a renegotiated withdrawal agreement by 13 February so that MPs could have a second \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on Valentine\u2019s Day. Britain\u2019s Eurosceptic press hailed \u201cTheresa\u2019s triumph\u201d but European politicians and especially the continental media were withering, condemning the prime minister as weak, untrustworthy and above all, willing to place the unity of her own party over the interests of her country. The EU would not play ball, they warned. It didn\u2019t. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier said firmly that the backstop was needed \u201cas it is\u201d, while EU council president Donald Tusk said the agreement was \u201cnot open for renegotiation\u201d and told May in a \u201cfrank\u201d phone call that no talks could begin without a concrete plan from Downing Street that had clear parliamentary support. As no-deal planning continued across the the EU, May warned MPs that their vote had not killed off the prospect of the UK crashing out. Officials in Brussels said a no-deal Brexit may be more likely because the prime minister will not have the political courage to ask for a long Brexit delay, which they believe she needs. Hardline Brexiters soon upped the ante, letting May know that the only backstop proposal they would back is a version of the so-called \u201cMalthouse compromise\u201d (apparently known in Brussels as \u201cthe madhouse compromise\u201d), which would remove the mechanism from the exit treaty altogether. With 53 days to go, the government set up a new working group to explore options \u2013 including new technology \u2013 for avoiding a hard border, but EU negotiator Sabine Weyand was quick to trash them, saying any concessions on border controls by the EU (what Brexiters described as \u201cgoodwill\u201d) would amount to dereliction of duty. As talks between May and the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, looked unlikely to soften her red lines, she set about wooing rebel Labour MPs from leave-voting constituencies with offers of improved worker\u2019s rights and even cash, leaving them divided and shadow chancellor John McDonnell accusing her of pork-barrel politics. And, of course, the good news kept coming: Nissan cited Brexit concerns in its decision not to build the new X-Trail in Sunderland (despite a 2016 government promise of \u00a360m if it did); the Institute for Directors said one in three UK firms could relocate abroad; the government is preparing for putrefying piles of rubbish after Brexit and a couple of Sunday papers reckoned the Queen would be evacuated from London if it all goes really pear-shaped. What next The EU does not, at this stage, look set to budge on the backstop: it considers the negotiations concluded and that all that may be possible is some form of additional legal assurance or perhaps a rewording of the political declaration \u2013 but not the 585-page withdrawal agreement itself. Neither of these options, in the opinion of both Martin Selmayr, the European commission secretary general, and British MPs from the Commons Brexit committee who were in Brussels to meet him on Monday, is likely to persuade Tory Brexit hardliners in the ERG group to back the deal. If the UK is not to crash out without a deal, an extension of article 50 now looks inevitable \u2013 except May has promised repeatedly that the UK will leave the EU on 29 March, making it hard for her to ask for extra time. Many MPs fear she is deliberately running down the clock, aiming to force parliament to back her deal at the last minute as the only alternative to a no deal. But this faces growing opposition from ministers such as the business secretary, Greg Clark, who want clarity by mid-February. And even if the government does end up asking for an extension, the EU may disagree over the length, possibly demanding up to a year to be sure there will be no repeats of the present chaos. The threat of a no-deal Brexit by accident, therefore, remains very real. Best of the rest Ryanair falls into the red as it warns no-deal Brexit risk is \u201cworryingly high\u201d.

      "body": "<p><strong>With universities in the UK facing significant threats to their finances, international students and their higher fees are likely to be more important than ever. The prime minister\u2019s review of post-18 education is widely expected to recommend a cut to home tuition fees next month. Meanwhile, vice-chancellors are braced for a major blow from Brexit, with European student numbers and research funding likely to be hit.<br><br>But after years of tough talking on immigration, how do we shore up this crucial market?</strong></p> <p><strong>In the latest of our 2VCs discussion series, Anna Fazackerley talks to Prof Nigel Carrington, </strong><strong>vice-chancellor of the University of the Arts </strong><strong>London (UAL), and Prof Paul Wellings, </strong><strong>vice-chancellor of Wollongong University in Australia.</strong></p> <p><strong>Wollongong, based in a coastal city in New South Wales with additional campuses in Sydney, is one of the country\u2019s most successful recruiters of international students. <a href=\"https://www.australianuniversities.com.au/directory/international-student-numbers/\">Forty per cent of its students are from overseas</a>, predominately from Asia. As well as bringing students </strong><strong>on to their home campuses they have </strong><strong>had a deliberate strategy to spread risk by building campuses overseas</strong><strong> in Dubai, Hong Kong and Malaysia. Wellings moved to Australia from Britain in 2012, and was previously </strong><strong>vice-chancellor of Lancaster University.</strong></p> <p><strong>UAL is now one of the biggest universities in London. It is made up of six specialist colleges with an established reputation abroad, including Central </strong><strong>Saint Martins and the London College of Fashion.

But privately vice-chancellors admit that the melting pot can be limited by the tendency of some groups of students to simply stick together. Wellings says that it is hugely important for all universities to think about encouraging students from different cultural backgrounds to engage. One way of doing this is through managed, small group work within courses, though course leaders must assign groups rather than leaving students to team up themselves. </p> <p>Outside the classroom he is also encouraging students to mix. \u201cAs we\u2019ve opened new residences we explicitly say these are intended to be open multicultural settings where people from different cultures come together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is undeniably a challenge to try to ensure that off-campus students don\u2019t aggregate together in international groups,\u201d Carrington agrees. He says that Chinese students in particular tend to want to stick together, and often they use social media before they arrive to find out which halls have the highest proportion of Chinese students. UAL isn\u2019t considering imposing quotas to manage this, but he suspects other universities might. \u201cThe ones who get more out of their experience in London will be those who socialise across cultures.\u201d The university has stepped up efforts in the first few weeks to introduce students from different countries through organised activities, but Carrington says that they will have to do more, especially as applications from China increase.</p> <p><strong>What do you most need your government to do in the future?</strong><br>\u201cPost-study work visas would put us back on a level playing field,\u201d Carrington says. \u201cThat alone would send a truly powerful message to a broad range of countries around the world about our welcoming of international students.\u201d</p> <p>Wellings wonders whether international student numbers will double in the next 20 years, driven by the rise of the middle class in India, Indonesia and China. If that happens he says the governments of Australia, the UK, the US and Canada all need to think very carefully about how they support higher education. \u201cThat lethal mix of international league tabls, visa regimes and exchange rates needs to be understood in the bureaucracies of all our countries.\u201d Meanwhile he says universities need to think harder about how they look after these higher fee-paying students. \u201cThey will come with increased demands and our frontline services need to be invested in,\u201d he says.</p> <h2><strong>Paul Wellings</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a5de549cb28f2efde28b5085df95a342759e029a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5de549cb28f2efde28b5085df95a342759e029a/256_148_1231_1538/800.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Wellings.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Wellings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wollongong University</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What was your first degree and where did you study?</strong><br>BSc botany and zoology, joint honours, King\u2019s College London.</p> <p><strong>What advice would you give your 18-year-old self? </strong><br>Speak up more often.</p> <p><strong>What book is on your bedside table? </strong><br>Everything Under by Daisy Johnson (shortlisted for the 2018 Man Booker prize).

      "bodyText": "With universities in the UK facing significant threats to their finances, international students and their higher fees are likely to be more important than ever. The prime minister\u2019s review of post-18 education is widely expected to recommend a cut to home tuition fees next month. Meanwhile, vice-chancellors are braced for a major blow from Brexit, with European student numbers and research funding likely to be hit. But after years of tough talking on immigration, how do we shore up this crucial market? In the latest of our 2VCs discussion series, Anna Fazackerley talks to Prof Nigel Carrington, vice-chancellor of the University of the Arts London (UAL), and Prof Paul Wellings, vice-chancellor of Wollongong University in Australia. Wollongong, based in a coastal city in New South Wales with additional campuses in Sydney, is one of the country\u2019s most successful recruiters of international students. Forty per cent of its students are from overseas, predominately from Asia. As well as bringing students on to their home campuses they have had a deliberate strategy to spread risk by building campuses overseas in Dubai, Hong Kong and Malaysia. Wellings moved to Australia from Britain in 2012, and was previously vice-chancellor of Lancaster University. UAL is now one of the biggest universities in London. It is made up of six specialist colleges with an established reputation abroad, including Central Saint Martins and the London College of Fashion. Like Wollongong, it\u2019s one of the leading British universities in terms of proportion of international students, with 39% of students currently coming from abroad according to in-house figures. Chinese students are their biggest market, and they had a 20% increase in applications from China for this academic year. Other big markets include India, South Korea and the US. They are heavily exposed when it comes to Brexit, with 15% of their students coming from other European countries. Right now, any conversation about recruiting students from overseas inevitably starts with Brexit. Wellings may be on the other side of the world but says that Brexit chaos is dominating the news in Australia. Academics there are mostly \u201cbemused\u201d by what is happening, because it seems obvious that \u201cthe great asset the UK has at the moment is the ability to engage directly with a very large European market\u201d. Carrington is unequivocal: \u201cThere is nothing good about Brexit for universities. I\u2019m being completely objective when I say that.\u201d Like many vice-chancellors, he wants a second referendum. \u201cThat\u2019s democracy. We know a lot more now about the implications of Brexit, and it seems only sensible and democratic for people to look again at what they now understand are the arguments.\u201d UAL has analysed the backgrounds of the European students they are typically recruiting and they are expecting to lose half of them \u2013 more than 1,000 students \u2013 if Brexit goes ahead as planned. They have two options for plugging this financial hole. The first is to try to recruit more UK students. However, Carrington points out that government education policies have led to a major decline in the number of students studying art and design at school. Option two is to step up international recruitment, though he worries this would \u201cchange in an unhealthy way the balance of nationalities\u201d. Carrington warns that many British universities will be tempted to simply pull in far more Chinese students to make up for EU student losses. \u201cWe are seeing extraordinary, very high-quality candidates from China in very high numbers now.\u201d Will Australian universities profit from Brexit?

In the north-east a third of students who would be denied a university education come from the most disadvantaged backgrounds. Four months ago, the education secretary, Damian Hinds, launched Opportunity North East, a \u00a324m campaign to raise aspirations and stop children in the region feeling they\u2019ve been \u201cleft behind\u201d. But the prime minister\u2019s review of post-18 education is, according to leaks, proposing that young people with less than 3Ds at A-level should not be allowed a loan. Data from Universities UK, the vice-chancellors\u2019 umbrella body, shows the change would hit the north-east \u2013 where 33% of students with lower than 3Ds are from the most disadvantaged families \u2013 much harder than any other region. A prominent Conservative MP, who asked not to be named, told Education Guardian: \u201cAre we seriously saying young people in the north-east are thicker than those in the south-east so they don\u2019t deserve to go to university? This is penalising young people for failures in the school system.\u201d The north-east has the worst youth unemployment rates in the country, and although it has some of the best-performing primary schools, poorer children are much less likely than in other regions to have access to a good secondary school, according to the Social Mobility Commission. The MP adds that the policy wouldn\u2019t stop students from wealthier backgrounds who perform badly at A-level from going to university, because their parents could pay for them to do retakes or simply bypass the loans restriction by pay their fees. \u201cTarquin still gets into university. But you create a secondary modern/grammar school situation where some people are just written off,\u201d the MP says. The second-hardest-hit region in terms of social mobility would be Yorkshire and the Humber, where UUK\u2019s data shows that 22% of those no longer entitled to a loan would be the most disadvantaged students. Vice-chancellors have branded the idea hugely regressive. They say poorer students are more likely to have low attainment, but this doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t succeed at university \u2013 and that universities, not the government, should make judgments about who has potential. Alistair Jarvis, the chief executive of UUK, says: \u201cIf the government is looking for a policy that keeps large numbers of students from lower socio-economic backgrounds out of university, it would be hard to come up with anything more exclusionary than setting a flat minimum entry tariff.\u201d He points out that there is an attainment gap of more than four months between disadvantaged children and their classmates when they first start school, and this rises to more than 19 months by the end of secondary school. But he says students can overcome this disadvantage and thrive at university, with 73% of students from the poorest areas netting a first or 2:1 degree.

Last week the National Crime Agency (NCA) revealed that the scale of the county lines trade, in which criminal networks use children to funnel drugs from cities to towns and rural areas, was far greater than previously thought.

We recently saw this scenario with a 12-year-old boy.\u201d Smartphones are also being used as tracking devices through apps like Find My Friends to monitor the movements of children transporting and selling drugs across the country. This practice, known as \u201cremote mothering\u201d, sometimes involves young people being forced to live-stream their movements 24 hours a day on WhatsApp or FaceTime. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this regularly with domestic violence and honour-based crimes where the victim is made to feel that they are constantly under surveillance and their every move is being tracked, and this is happening with county lines,\u201d said Sawyer. \u201cThis is extremely traumatic and isolating. Young people who want to exit [gangs] don\u2019t feel they\u2019re able to seek help because the gangs will know where they are. We had one teenage boy who came in to one of our services and wouldn\u2019t sit down. He just walked around and around the room because he was so paranoid that if he stopped moving they would find out where he was.\u201d Gang members send children pictures of their mother\u2019s front door when they are on an operation and threaten to firebomb the house if they stop working for them. Young people are told their phone must be switched on and charged at all times and they must answer it within two rings, or they are threatened with violent repercussions. \u201cThey have complete control of children through their phones,\u201d said Sawyer. \u201cThere is nowhere for them to hide.\u201d Failing to tackle the use of mobile phones and social media by drug gangs to coerce and control young people has contributed to the huge growth in county lines drug operations, said Thomas. \u201cIn many ways it\u2019s too late to get a grip on this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were warning the government and the police about this almost a decade ago but nobody took any action, and now it\u2019s got to the point where the state is trying to play catch-up with a situation that has moved far beyond their control.\u201d One solution, he said, would be to invest more in mediation and peer-to-peer mentoring schemes where young people can meet others who have gone through similar experiences. The Children\u2019s Society says official guidance and protocols around how social media is used to exploit and coerce children into criminal activities must be integrated into statutory services designed to tackle county lines operations. \u201cThis is often an invisible form of coercion and exploitation that is happening without any adults being able or willing to intervene,\u201d said Sawyer. \u201cFor these young people there is no difference between the online and offline worlds and we have to tackle this because we are facing a national crisis and this problem is only going to get worse.\u201d",

We\u2019ll be closing the blog shortly, but, before that, let\u2019s just recap the day\u2019s events in <strong>Townsville</strong>. </p> <p>The main story from today is the sad news that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/05/bodies-of-two-men-found-in-flood-waters-in-townsville\">two men aged in their 20s have died</a> in the floods. Earlier, police said they held grave fears for two men who were last seen on Monday morning. We will learn more about the circumstances in the hours and days to come. </p> <p>On a brighter note, the flood waters have begun to subside around Townsville, though authorities have said there is more rainfall expected over the next few days. The monsoon trough over Townsville is not expected to shift until the weekend.</p> <p>Locals are now going through the awful process of returning to their waterlogged homes and businesses. Our thoughts are with them as they do this \u2013 just as they are with the families of the two people who have lost their lives. The damage bill is expected to reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Some schools are beginning to reopen, but it\u2019s unlikely normal daily life will resume for some time. </p> <p>With that, thanks again for joining us.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for following along with us again today. We\u2019ll be closing the blog shortly, but, before that, let\u2019s just recap the day\u2019s events in Townsville. The main story from today is the sad news that two men aged in their 20s have died in the floods. Earlier, police said they held grave fears for two men who were last seen on Monday morning. We will learn more about the circumstances in the hours and days to come. On a brighter note, the flood waters have begun to subside around Townsville, though authorities have said there is more rainfall expected over the next few days. The monsoon trough over Townsville is not expected to shift until the weekend. Locals are now going through the awful process of returning to their waterlogged homes and businesses. Our thoughts are with them as they do this \u2013 just as they are with the families of the two people who have lost their lives. The damage bill is expected to reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Some schools are beginning to reopen, but it\u2019s unlikely normal daily life will resume for some time. With that, thanks again for joining us. We\u2019ll see you next time. The Insurance Council of Australia has revised its current estimate of insurance losses up \u2013 it now sits at $45m from 3,500 claims. The council expects that figure to rise as people return to their homes. This has been occurring gradually throughout the day, although authorities say many homes are still unsafe. The RACQ Bank says it has suspended home loan repayments for three months for those impacted by the Townsville floods. \u201cWe\u2019ve initiated a three-month moratorium on home loan repayments for Townsville flood victims because we get it \u2013 when times are tough, paying off your home loan is the least of your worries,\u201d the bank\u2019s chief executive, Michelle Bagnall, said. \u201cWhat this means is, if people cannot meet their repayments, they needn\u2019t worry about it. If they do want to continue paying their regular mortgage, that\u2019s fine, but if they\u2019re unable, they have a three-month pause.\u201d Slowly, the dam levels are dropping. It was at nearly 250% above capacity on Monday afternoon. Climate change is known to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather and the role of longer term climate trends will be assessed at a later date, said the senior meteorologist Grace Legge. \u201cNormally if we see this sort of intense rainfall we don\u2019t see it for such a long period,\u201d Legge said. She said it was the first time Townsville had recorded more than seven days in a row of rainfall of more than 50mm per day. Up to Monday morning, Townsville had received 1,158mm over a seven-day period. Its previous record over seven days was 886.2mm in 1998. Legge said the immediate cause was the slow-moving nature of the monsoonal trough and a ridge from a high in the Tasman Sea that was keeping the trough stationary. A burst of westerlies had intensified the weather over the weekend, but it was not enough to force it to the south. \u201cYou\u2019ve got two things fighting to make it move that are cancelling each other out. There\u2019s nothing to push it one way or the other so it stays still,\u201d she said. As of Tuesday, the intense rain was beginning to slip further south but the Bom was still forecasting 50-100mm of rainfall in Townsville, with the potential for more severe weather. Legge said towards the weekend, the rainfall might move out to the Coral Sea. \u201cWe might see that low move out to the Coral Sea. That will drag the rainfall with it,\u201d Legge said. \u201cSo it\u2019s looking like towards the weekend we might start to see these conditions ease.\u201d In a 10-day period, Townsville has received more than its annual average rainfall and broken records for its longest running period of days above 50mm of rain. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has described the floods as \u201cunprecedented\u201d, but what is behind the weather that has dumped more than two metres of rain in some areas? The immediate cause of the torrential rain, says the Bureau of Meteorology, is a monsoonal trough that has been sitting in one spot for more than a week. \u201cThis weather pattern brings a lot of rain and usually flooding rain over northern Queensland,\u201d said Vinord Anand, a forecaster with the Bureau of Meteorology. \u201cThe last several days, all of the intense rainfall we\u2019ve seen in that area has been due to that weather disturbance. \u201cThe only thing different with this one is it\u2019s been sitting in the same spot for a long time. What that means is the rain has continued to fall in the same spot for five to seven days.\u201d Our environment reporter, Lisa Cox, has just filed some analysis on the weather situation in Townsville. I am going to post it in two parts for ease of reading. The premier said earlier that the education department would today assess which public schools could reopen. In the Catholic sector, all but one will be open tomorrow. Never leave a kangaroo behind. We learned earlier today that the Bruce Highway had reopened. That is crucial news given the food shortages that had arisen. However there are still major road closures elsewhere, as this statement from the Queensland roads minister, Mark Bailey, points out. \u201cThe Finders Highway is expected to be cut for some days with the Macrossan Bridge over the Burdekin River under water,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have also recorded multiple landslips on Hervey Range Road, between Townsville and Charters Towers, as well as a major landslip on Paluma Range. \u201cInland supply routes from Mount Isa to the coast are still closed. \u201cWhen the water recedes, roads and bridges will be inspected as soon as possible to ensure they are safe before reopening. \u201cAuthorities will continue to work with rural communities across the north-west of the state to monitor fuel and food supplies.\u201d Luke Henriques-Gomes here taking over again. Thanks to Michael for taking the keys just now. A bit more on the discovery of the bodies of two men in their 20s while we wait for official word from police. It\u2019s understood the two bodies were discovered in a stormwater drain in Aitkenvale, a suburb in Townsville. Police said yesterday the two men were possibly missing, last seen in the same area on Monday morning. The ABC is reporting that police were searching for two men after an alleged break and enter in the area. Sad news. Local media are reporting the bodies of two men have been discovered in Townsville. It\u2019s believed they are the same two men reported missing yesterday. On Monday police said two men aged 21 and 23 were missing after they were last seen in Ross River Road in Aitkenvale near flood waters. Police have yet to confirm to confirm the news but it\u2019s being widely reported across local media. What was that thing emergency services are always warning people not to do in flood waters? Just a quick note to let you all know that I\u2019ll be taking the keys from Luke for the next little while. How about this rain, eh? In what must be incredibly frustrating news for many locals, authorities in Townsville say it is still too dangerous for people to return to flooded homes. That\u2019s despite the fact that water levels are receding. A statement from the Townsville Local Disaster Management Group warns that flooded areas are \u201cstill an active emergency zone with flooded waters hiding potentially fast-flowing water, debris and sewage\u201d. And if the rain returns, the water may rise rapidly. \u201cExperts are still predicting rain and thunderstorms with the potential of up to 100mm of rain per day for the next few days,\u201d the mayor, Jenny Hill, said. \u201cWe are asking everyone to stay away from flooded houses and roads for the time being because there are a number of health and safety risks. \u201cEven if the rain slows there is still a danger of flooding and rising water going back into homes.\u201d The Ross River dam is slowly subsiding. It has just dropped below 200% capacity. Small steps. Yesterday the premier estimated that the damage bill in Townsville would be in the hundreds of millions. Here\u2019s $2m of that \u2013 according to a local hockey club. Good news from Townsville airport. The prime minister was sporting a camouflage jacket as he visited flooded areas of Townsville alongside the army. Just on the prime minister\u2019s earlier no comment on climate change. My colleague, Ben Smee, noted these comments from Bill Shorten yesterday. Bill Shorten has just made some fairly strong statements linking extreme weather \u2013 the flooding in Townsville and fires in Tasmania \u2013 to climate change. The Labor leader says from Huonville in Tasmania that \u201ceven Australia\u2019s most extreme climate deniers\u201d would have to accept that extreme weather events are becoming more common and that \u201cclimate change is having some effect\u201d. \u201cIt is legitimate to talk about climate change. If we can\u2019t talk about climate change now, with the range of weather events that we\u2019ve got, when will we ever be able to talk about climate change?\u201d A reporter at the press conference notes there have been a \u201crecord number of weather events, cyclones\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s your thinking on climate change?\u201d the reporter asks Morrison. The prime minister replies that he\u2019s not focused on \u201cpolitics\u201d today. My thinking is the support for Townsville people. I\u2019m not engaging in broader policy debates today. I\u2019m engaging in the needs of people here on the ground, people in evacuation centres, with some trepidation going back into their homes and finding what they\u2019re going to find. That\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on today, not politics. Morrison says that the commonwealth will provide Category C disaster assistance following a request from the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk. This is from Department of Home Affairs: Category C assistance is only made available when the impact of a disaster is severe. It is intended to be in addition to assistance under Categories A and B and is usually considered once the impacts of the disaster on affected communities have been assessed. Category C assistance is requested from the states and requires agreement from the prime minister. \u201cEvery request being made of us, our answer is yes and quickly,\u201d Morrison says. \u201cWe also initiated last night, I gave the instruction, for the defence forces to support airlifts. \u201cThere is one that will be getting off the ground very soon and that is going into Cairns.\u201d The premier\u2019s press conference has wrapped up \u2013 and Scott Morrison\u2019s has begun. Morrison has been visiting homes as some locals return to survey the wreckage. The Nationals MP George Christensen and Liberal senators Linda Reynolds and Ian Macdonald are also there. The prime minister says the \u201ccare and compassion\u201d people are showing to each other has been a \u201cprivilege\u201d to witness. \u201cIt is who we are, and I want to thank everyone here in Townsville for all the incredible work they are doing,\u201d he says. The Queensland police deputy commissioner, Bob Gee, has reiterated the premier\u2019s call for \u201cpatience\u201d. \u201cIt is not safe to go back to homes, it is not safe to go into those flood waters,\u201d Gee says. He is pleased there have only been two reported break and enter offences in flooded areas and adds that 60 police have been sent in to keep homes safe. Gee says that police hold serious concerns for the two men reported missing. As mentioned earlier, they are Hughie Morton, 21, and Troy Mathieson, 23. There was one potential sighting of one of the men, but that has not been confirmed. Richard Wardle, the acting state manager for Queensland for the Bureau of Meteorology, says the monsoon is expected to \u201cremain active for the coming days, potentially easing over the weekend\u201d. \u201cSo there is an end in sight,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we are expecting further periods of heavy rainfall, some of it very heavy, about the north-east tropics for the next few days, between about Cardwell and Mackay, and with that there is the real elevated risk of flash flooding.\u201d The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, is addressing the media now. A few early points: There have already been nearly 9,000 applications for personal hardship grants. About 2,700 have been processed. The number of people without power has fallen from 17,000 to 11,000 The Bruce Highway has reopened \u2013 allowing freight trucks to deliver fresh food Authorities are assessing which schools will be able to reopen There are reports that livestock has died out west, around Flinders and Cloncurry \u201cThere has been a lot of great work happening on the ground up in Townsville, out west, up north,\u201d Palaszczuk says. \u201cTo all the agencies that are working together, our emergency services personnel, the Army, everyone that has been pitching in, helping, it has been a great team effort. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go. I know I\u2019m asking now for people to have patience. We are doing everything we possibly can and good news today that that freight is now travelling north.\u201d Good news from out on the roads. Highway closures had been contributing to food shortages at supermarkets along the north Queensland coast. As I mentioned earlier, the prime minister is in Townsville. Scott Morrison will be holding a press conference in the suburb of Cranbrook at 11.15am local time, so in about 50 minutes\u2019 time. Queensland\u2019s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has described the floods as unprecedented. The cause of the prolonged rainfall is a monsoonal trough that has been sitting over the Townsville area. While monsoonal rainfall occurs throughout summer in northern Queensland, the difference this time is the trough isn\u2019t moving. \u201cThis weather pattern brings a lot of rain and usually flooding rain over northern Queensland,\u201d says Vinord Anand, a forecaster with the Bureau of Meteorology. \u201cThe last several days, all of the intense rainfall we\u2019ve seen in that area has been due to that weather disturbance. \u201cThe only thing different with this one is it\u2019s been sitting in the same spot for a long time. What that means is the rain has continued to fall in the same spot for five to seven days.\u201d The heaviest rainfall in the past week has been more than a metre. In the Townsville region, Woolshed has had 1,663mm in the past seven days and Paluma 1,629mm. Townsville airport itself, the main entry point to the region, has had 1,558mm. Ayr through to Townsville and up to Cardwell have all had in excess of one metre of rain. Anand says there are likely to be two or three more days of intense rainfall to go: \u201cWe seem to be probably past the halfway mark.\u201d Townsville is still technically in the rescue and evacuation phase. Among the thousands who have been evacuating is Brady Ellis, a radio host in Townsville. The video below shows his family leaving their waterlogged home, but the star of the show his is dog, Axl. About half way through, you can see him surfing through the water with the help of the army. One of the things you might have been wondering if you\u2019ve been following the floods crisis is how Townsville\u2019s main catchment, the Ross River dam, has been at more than twice its capacity. On Monday, for example, it peaked at 244.8%. In fact, as this excellent explainer from the ABC points out, the capacity level refers to the approved level for drinking or irrigation. And, in simple terms, owing to the flat slopes of the reservoir, the capacity level can increase without the water level rising too much. And here\u2019s a zoomed-out look at the rainfall in Queensland over the past seven days. As has been mentioned, Townsville has received about a year\u2019s worth of rain in a week. Those red dots west of the coast, however, are a godsend for farmers in drought-stricken areas of the state. This map from the Bureau of Meteorology shows rainfall totals overnight. But here\u2019s what the same area looked like over Sunday night-Monday morning. Here\u2019s a look at the front page of Townsville\u2019s main newspaper, the Bulletin. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is in Townsville. Earlier, I mentioned that there were fears for two missing men. They are Hughie Morton, 21, and Troy Mathieson, 23. They were last seen on Monday morning near flood waters in the Townsville suburb of Aitkenvale. This morning there was significant rainfall \u2013 about 200mm in two hours \u2013 at Bluewater, just north of Townsville. There are concerns about flash flooding there, with an emergency warning in place. In Townsville itself conditions have eased \u2013 the city only copped about 37mm of rain over the past 24 hours. That\u2019s good news, but the city\u2019s Ross River dam is still at double its intended capacity. Hello and thanks for joining day two of our live coverage of the Queensland floods. My name is Luke Henriques-Gomes. First, the bad news. Two men are feared missing as an area just north Townsville was hit by another deluge of monsoonal rain overnight. Rain is also forecast for central Townsville today. Authorities had warned on Monday that the crisis was far from over \u2013 it appears they were right. Questions are also mounting over the response to crisis by officials, particularly the timing of opening of floodgates at the local Ross River dam. That lead to inundation of thousands of homes across the tropical city. Please stay with us throughout the day \u2013 and, if you\u2019re in north Queensland, stay safe.",

      "bodyText": "North Korea is trying to ensure its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities are safe from US military strikes, a UN report has said, as officials from both countries prepared to meet to discuss a second summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un. Trump is expected to meet the North Korean leader, possibly in Vietnam, at the end of the month to discuss measures that would lead to Pyongyang giving up its nuclear weapons in return for US security guarantees and other assurances. But the report, seen by Reuters on Monday, suggested the regime was doing everything possible to protect its nuclear and missile programmes. In the confidential report, recently submitted to UN security council members, sanctions monitors said they had \u201cfound evidence of a consistent trend on the part of [North Korea] to disperse its assembly, storage and testing locations\u201d. It said the North was \u201cusing civilian facilities, including airports, for ballistic missile assembly and testing with the goal of effectively preventing \u2018decapitation\u2019 strikes\u2019 on a smaller number of identified nuclear and missile assembly and manufacturing sites\u201d. The claims could add to pressure on Trump to secure denuclearisation commitments from Kim, including the dismantling of the North\u2019s main Yongbyon nuclear complex, possibly in return for US agreement to formally end the 1950-53 Korean war. Kim made a vague commitment to work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula when he met Trump for the first time, in Singapore in June last year. Trump last week said \u201ctremendous progress\u201d had been made on denuclearisation, even though negotiations have stalled amid disagreement over which side should be first to introduce key measures. Washington claims North Korea has done little to demonstrate its willingness to abandon its nuclear programme, while Pyongyang has called for the US to lift economic sanctions in response to its freeze on missile and nuclear tests and the dismantling of some nuclear facilities. The US director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, told congress last week that \u201cNorth Korea is unlikely to give up all of its nuclear weapons and production capabilities\u201d. The UN report emerged as Trump\u2019s North Korea envoy, Stephen Biegun, prepared to meet his North Korean counterpart, Kim Hyok-chol, in Pyongyang on Wednesday to prepare for the summit. Biegun said last week he was hoping to establish \u201ca set of concrete deliverables\u201d for the summit, including \u201ca roadmap of negotiations and declarations going forward, and a shared understanding of the desired outcomes of our joint efforts\u201d. He said Kim Jong-un had committed during an October visit by the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to dismantle and destroy his country\u2019s plutonium and uranium enrichment facilities in return for \u201ccorresponding measures\u201d from Washington. Biegun said those reciprocal measures would be discussed this week, adding that the US was willing to discuss \u201cmany actions\u201d to improve ties and persuade the North to abandon its nuclear ambitions. Last week he said Trump was willing to offer diplomatic relations and economic aid in return for progress towards \u201cclosing the door on 70 years of war and hostility\u201d on the Korean peninsula. The Vietnamese resort town of Da Nang is being tipped as the most likely location for the summit, with Trump expected to confirm the date and venue during his State of the Union address on Tuesday.",

The Guardian focuses on business secretary Greg Clark\u2019s previous denials of any \u201cspecial deal\u201d: \u201cMinister under fire as secret \u00a380m Nissan deal revealed\u201d. The main image is the underwater wreck of Emiliano Sala\u2019s plane, with a third story on social media driving anxiety among the young. The Telegraph goes with Clark and Nissan, and the FT follows a similar vein but tops it with Theresa May facing pressure to rule out no deal. The Times puts a pugilistic Neeson image front and centre, and revels in Europe\u2019s Martin Selmayr being rebuffed by ERG MPs over his offer to beef up protections against a backstop. The Mail also features an aggressive-looking Neeson and dusts off its \u201cAt last \u2026\u201d headline, this time for its exclusive on plans to make social media companies protect young people online in the wake of the death of Molly Russell. The i wins the award for most positive Brexit coverage, giving its front page to Angela Merkel\u2019s \u201colive branch\u201d to the UK, after the German chancellor suggested a bit of creativity could help seal a deal. The Express says Ofgem is about to approve one of the biggest energy price rises in a decade, while the Mirror focuses on its Fair Care For All campaign, reporting that 600 people are day are leaving their jobs to look after sick relatives. The Sun says Love Island\u2019s Jack Fincham is sorry for taking cocaine, and gives its front-page sub a thankless task with a narrow Neeson headline. \u201cNeeson in racist kill bid outrage\u201d is the result.

Copious salads (\u20ac10) are inventive, a red prawn Thai curry (\u20ac14) delicious and homemade cakes really hit the spot. There\u2019s live music on Friday and Saturday nights. \u2022 Rambla Obispo Orber\u00e1 17, +34 950 30 73 78, on Facebook Caf\u00e9 Express For vegetarians and seafood fans on a budget, this little cafe is perfect. Amid the buzz of Almer\u00eda\u2019s renovated food market, this is where to bring fish, shellfish, vegetables or meat to be freshly grilled by the charming Inmaculada. The seafood section of the market is downstairs \u2013 ask for the fish to be cleaned. Grilling a generous portion costs \u20ac6, washed down with a glass of Almer\u00edan wine (\u20ac2) or beer. Inmaculada recommends local specialities, including fat red prawns, anchovies, red mullet, calamares and tuna. Raf tomato salad with anchovies works well as a starter. \u2022 Stand 17, Mercado Central, on Facebook Cafe Cyrano A couple of blocks south of the market, you have it all \u2013 breakfast, tapas, lunch, cakes and cocktails at tables and sofas in a mellow atmosphere, perfect for when those cloudless Almer\u00edan skies take a break or the heat sizzles. With a strong artsy agenda and plentiful bookshelves, Cyrano has carved out a niche. Free (generous) tapas are listed on a blackboard, while a changing menu includes inventive salads, sandwiches, burgers (\u20ac10), as well as Korean bulgogi (barbecued beef, \u20ac15) and a red velvet layer cake to finish. Draught beers, good wines and coffee crown what\u2019s on offer. \u2022 Calle Mendez Nu\u00f1ez 19, +34 950 58 99 64, on Facebook Taberna Entrevinos With a traditional tiled-and-beamed setting, this popular tavern justifies a walk to its rather uninspiring location east of the centre. Carnivores will be thrilled (Ib\u00e9rico pork secreto, \u20ac18, caramelised pork knuckles, juicy rib steak, Black Angus steak, wagyu beef carpaccio, \u20ac15), also pescatarians (octopus, bonito tuna salad, \u20ac14) and vegans, too. Plus, sherry aficionados are in for a treat. For cheaper prices, eat on a stool at the lengthy bar where you pick your tapas (about \u20ac2), though the restaurant at the back is warm, cheerful and perfect for protracted indulgence. \u2022 Calle Francisco Garc\u00eda G\u00f3ngora 11, +34 950 25 75 61, tabernaentrevinos.net La Barraquilla It is worth investing \u20ac12-\u20ac15 in a taxi to whisk you to this chiringuito, a local legend for more than 40 years and open every day of the year. Although uninspiring to look at, this simple restaurant has a great beach location. Ultra-fresh seafood, of course, heads the menu: choose from a counter of fresh shellfish and fish but beware, as prices climb according to weight. Don\u2019t miss the soupy arroz de mariscos (seafood and rice, \u20ac15), delicious semolina migas (\u20ac7) or patatas a lo pobre (poor man\u2019s potatoes, \u20ac8). Book a table in the front section with a view over the Med. \u2022 Avenida de la Playa, El Alqui\u00e1n, +34 850 52 01 71, on Facebook Fiona Dunlop is author of Andaluz: A Food Journey through Southern Spain (Interlink Books, \u00a327) and leads food tours through Andaluc\u00eda",

The two men, both in their early 20s, were discovered in a stormwater drain near the Aitkenvale library on Tuesday afternoon. On Monday police said two men aged 21 and 23 were missing after they were last seen on Ross River Road in Aitkenvale near flood waters on Monday morning. It is understood police had been looking for the two men after an alleged break and enter in the area. \u201cThey were involved in another police investigation,\u201d the state disaster co-ordinator and Queensland police deputy commissioner, Bob Gee, said. \u201cI cannot confirm that any of them actually entered flood waters.\u201d Queensland police confirmed on Tuesday night the two bodies belonged to the missing men. \u201cThe bodies were found near Aitkenvale Park around midday and have been identified.

The ethical standards command will investigate the matter for the state coroner with oversight by the Crime and Corruption Commission. The news comes as flood waters in Townsville slowly begin to recede on the 11th day since the record monsoonal rains began to hammer the north Queensland city. Thousands of people remained unable to return to their homes, with the State Emergency Service receiving almost 1,200 calls for help in the 48 hours up to Tuesday morning. Overnight, Bluewater Creek in the city\u2019s north, copped 340mm of rain, with almost 100 calls for help to emergency service crews. A staggering 1.8m of rain has fallen on the suburb of Upper Bluewater over the past seven days. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said a recovery centre was opened in Townsville.

Poor children were paid one nickel per catch, which meant scores of healthy pets also met their ends.</p> <p>Thanks to some New Yorkers, however, many were saved from slaughter in acts of kindness which have been documented by Peggy Gavan in a new book, The Cat Men of Gotham: Tales of Feline Friendships in Old New York.</p> <p>Though stories and pictures of cats have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/06/cats-dogs-internet-memes-lolcats-keyboard-grumpy\">become enormously popular online</a> in today\u2019s world, Gavan\u2019s book shows the path to this obsession was evident decades ago.</p> <p>\u201cIn the late 1800s, early 1900s, every time a cat did something \u2013 saved its family by meowing at a fire, or was rescued by a police officer, or something like that \u2013 it always made the headlines,\u201d Gavan said.</p> <p>The Brooklyn Navy Yard, then America\u2019s premier naval shipbuilder, was reeling from rat infestations in the late 1800s, which damaged expensive docks and equipment. The dogs deployed by US Navy brass to combat them would flee in fear. For years, most of the cats prowling the property \u201cwere quickly scooped up by sailors who wanted a good-luck mascot\u201d.</p> <p>But a group of \u201cland-lubber\u201d felines wandered onto the yard in 1893 and finally brought the rat population under control within a few years. One worker told a reporter that a ratter named Minnie \u201cdeserves a gold medal for preserving the property of the United States government,\u201d Gavan writes.</p> <p>A cat named Chops, who took up residence at a firehouse, was described by the firemen as \u201ca Catholic cat\u201d who \u201cliked fish on Fridays\u201d. When Chops was caught under a wheel of a fire vehicle and died, the distraught fire fighters held a memorial for Chops and another firehouse cat, and received a \u201cproper funeral so the men could pay their last respects,\u201d Gavan writes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b505f4351f32b2826f16a817c651a7f02e196536\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b505f4351f32b2826f16a817c651a7f02e196536/0_0_3000_2131/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crewman on deck, with cats, 1898.

You had hundreds of cats down at the post office,\u201d she said. \u201cMost businesses, restaurants, hotels, had cats because they controlled the mice and the rats. Dogs don\u2019t do that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCats would just do more things. And they [the \u201ccat men\u201d] would always call the press and make a big deal out of it.\u201d</p> <p>Even though the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals agreed to oversee control and care for New York City\u2019s cats and dogs in 1894, extermination was commonplace.</p> <p>Cats and dogs discovered in New York City without collars would be euthanized if not claimed within two days. But because it cost $3 to pick up a lost pet from shelters \u2013 a hefty sum in late-19th century New York \u2013 \u201ccountless loved pets were seized and destroyed,\u201d Gavan writes.</p> <p>So where are the \u201ccat women\u201d in this story? Gavan said that strict gender roles kept women out of the workplaces and social spaces that tended to draw more attention from the male-dominated press, meaning women didn\u2019t show up in as many of the news articles that have informed her book.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not to say there weren\u2019t also stories about cats and women, but honestly, most of those stories that I\u2019ve found were [about] the proverbial \u2018crazy cat lady\u2019,\u201d Gavan said. \u201cThey would be stories about the woman who had fifty cats in her house. It was always kind of a more negative story.\u201d</p> <p>A medical editor by day, Gavan has used her spare time to research and write about animals that made headlines and captured hearts on her blog, <a href=\"http://hatchingcatnyc.com/\">The Hatching Cat.</a> Gavan said she chose to focus the book, which is <a href=\"https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/the-cat-men-of-gotham/9781978800229\">scheduled to be published in May</a>, on cats because they \u201care really hot right now\u201d.</p>",

Though stories and pictures of cats have become enormously popular online in today\u2019s world, Gavan\u2019s book shows the path to this obsession was evident decades ago. \u201cIn the late 1800s, early 1900s, every time a cat did something \u2013 saved its family by meowing at a fire, or was rescued by a police officer, or something like that \u2013 it always made the headlines,\u201d Gavan said. The Brooklyn Navy Yard, then America\u2019s premier naval shipbuilder, was reeling from rat infestations in the late 1800s, which damaged expensive docks and equipment. The dogs deployed by US Navy brass to combat them would flee in fear. For years, most of the cats prowling the property \u201cwere quickly scooped up by sailors who wanted a good-luck mascot\u201d. But a group of \u201cland-lubber\u201d felines wandered onto the yard in 1893 and finally brought the rat population under control within a few years. One worker told a reporter that a ratter named Minnie \u201cdeserves a gold medal for preserving the property of the United States government,\u201d Gavan writes. A cat named Chops, who took up residence at a firehouse, was described by the firemen as \u201ca Catholic cat\u201d who \u201cliked fish on Fridays\u201d. When Chops was caught under a wheel of a fire vehicle and died, the distraught fire fighters held a memorial for Chops and another firehouse cat, and received a \u201cproper funeral so the men could pay their last respects,\u201d Gavan writes. Gavan says the history of the so-called \u201ccat men\u201d also sheds light on the lives of workers at other storied New York institutions, from City Hall to the New York Police Department to the Algonquin Hotel. \u201cEvery police station, every firehouse, had a cat. You had hundreds of cats down at the post office,\u201d she said. \u201cMost businesses, restaurants, hotels, had cats because they controlled the mice and the rats. Dogs don\u2019t do that.\u201d \u201cCats would just do more things. And they [the \u201ccat men\u201d] would always call the press and make a big deal out of it.\u201d Even though the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals agreed to oversee control and care for New York City\u2019s cats and dogs in 1894, extermination was commonplace. Cats and dogs discovered in New York City without collars would be euthanized if not claimed within two days. But because it cost $3 to pick up a lost pet from shelters \u2013 a hefty sum in late-19th century New York \u2013 \u201ccountless loved pets were seized and destroyed,\u201d Gavan writes. So where are the \u201ccat women\u201d in this story? Gavan said that strict gender roles kept women out of the workplaces and social spaces that tended to draw more attention from the male-dominated press, meaning women didn\u2019t show up in as many of the news articles that have informed her book. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say there weren\u2019t also stories about cats and women, but honestly, most of those stories that I\u2019ve found were [about] the proverbial \u2018crazy cat lady\u2019,\u201d Gavan said. \u201cThey would be stories about the woman who had fifty cats in her house. It was always kind of a more negative story.\u201d A medical editor by day, Gavan has used her spare time to research and write about animals that made headlines and captured hearts on her blog, The Hatching Cat. Gavan said she chose to focus the book, which is scheduled to be published in May, on cats because they \u201care really hot right now\u201d.",

The Victorians\u2019 development of steel led to an era of majestic bridges and vaulted train sheds. The American invention of the elevator created the first skyscrapers in Chicago. Now, we are seeing a new type of structure that perfectly embodies the 21st-century age of technical ingenuity and extreme inequality. A heady confluence of engineering prowess, zoning loopholes and an unparalleled concentration of personal wealth have together spawned a new species of super-tall, super-skinny, super-expensive spire.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/feb/18/super-tall-super-skinny-super-expensive-the-pencil-towers-of-new-yorks-super-rich-podcast\">Super-tall, super-skinny, super-expensive: the 'pencil towers' of New York's super-rich \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Any visitor to New York over the past few years will have witnessed this curious new breed of pencil-thin tower. Poking up above the Manhattan skyline like etiolated beanpoles, they seem to defy the laws of both gravity and commercial sense. They stand like naked elevator shafts awaiting their floors, raw extrusions of capital piled up until it hits the clouds.</p> <p>These towers are not only the product of advances in construction technology \u2013 and a global surfeit of super-rich buyers \u2013 but a zoning policy that allows a developer to acquire unused airspace nearby, add it to their own lot, and erect a vast structure without any kind of public review process taking place. The face of New York is changing at a rate not seen for decades, and the deals that are driving it are all happening behind closed doors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/skyscrapers/giv-39020cuxRPj7P5Bq/\" data-alt=\"'Transferable development rights' and 'Floor area ratio' explainer\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/skyscrapers/giv-39020cuxRPj7P5Bq/\">'Transferable development rights' and 'Floor area ratio' explainer</a> </figure>  <p>The results range from the sublime to the ridiculous, or even both at once. There is <a href=\"https://www.432parkavenue.com\" title=\"\">432 Park Avenue</a>, a surreal square tube of white concrete that appears to shoot twice as high as anything around it, its endless Cartesian grid of windows framing worlds of solid marble bathtubs and climate-controlled wine cellars within. It is the most elegant of the new towers, recalling the minimalist sculptures of <a href=\"https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/\" title=\"\">Sol LeWitt</a>, although its architect, Raphael Vi\u00f1oly, says it was <a href=\"https://ny.curbed.com/2015/6/1/9954820/a-225-trash-can-inspired-nycs-tallest-residential-tower\" title=\"\">inspired by a trash can</a>. He can clearly turn garbage into gold, given the penthouse sold for $95m (\u00a372m).</p> <p>It is the tallest residential building in the world, but it won\u2019t be for long. The sturdy trunk of <a href=\"https://centralparktower.com\" title=\"\">Central Park Tower</a> is rising nearby \u2013 a great glass hulk that will soon steal the crown for the most vertiginous residences on the planet. Designed by Adrian Smith and Gordon Gill, architects of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/picture/2012/oct/19/eyewitness-dubai\" title=\"\">Dubai\u2019s Burj Khalifa</a>, the tower will form a dizzying stack of superlatives, with the biggest pools, highest health club and farthest-reaching views in town. You might even be able to peer into your neighbouring oligarch\u2019s flat, given how close the next-door tower is squeezed.</p> <p>Standing right across the street, <a href=\"http://www.ramsa.com/projects/project/220-central-park-south\" title=\"\">220 Central Park South</a> aims to be the gentleman of the bunch. A neo-art deco tower clad in silvery Alabama limestone, with set-back terraces and ornamental metalwork, it is the work of Robert AM Stern, expedient purveyor of whatever style his client wants, from Spanish revival to Qing dynasty. \u201cArchitecture is a banquet,\u201d Stern tells me, \u201cand most architects are starving to death.\u201d He says that \u201cunlike some of its neighbours now under development\u201d, his design \u201cwill belong to the family of buildings that have framed Central Park for generations\u201d. The dapper costume has paid off: some apartments in his tower have gone for more than $10,000 per square foot. The penthouse was recently acquired by a hedge-fund billionaire for $238m, making it the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/24/america-most-expensive-home-new-york-ken-griffin\" title=\"\">most expensive home</a> ever sold in the US.</p> <p><a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Form_Follows_Finance.html?id=8ITT7GXSQnIC&amp;redir_esc=y\">Form has always followed finance</a> in New York, and this latest architectural byproduct of excess global wealth is no exception. Building very tall has been technically possible for some time, but it hasn\u2019t made much commercial sense: the higher you go, the cost of building <a href=\"https://www.credit-suisse.com/corporate/en/articles/news-and-expertise/billions-for-buildings-201601.html\" title=\"\">often exceeds</a> the returns. That is, until now.</p> <p>Like leggy plants given too much fertiliser, these buildings are a symptom of a city irrigated with too much money. The world\u2019s population of ultra-high-net-worth individuals, a super-elite with assets of at least $30m, has now mushroomed beyond 250,000 people, all in need of somewhere to store their wealth. More than a third of them are based in North America, while those from riskier economic climes favour New York real estate as one of the safest places to park their cash.</p> <p>Since the 2008 global financial crisis, luxury housing has become a new world currency, providing investors with both a tangible asset and a certain cachet that can\u2019t be found in stocks and hedge funds. The continued volatility of financial markets has spurred buyers to seek safe havens in super-prime real estate, from London to New York and Hong Kong, begetting stratospheric prices and minting a whole new category that defies the usual rules of the marketplace: the \u201ctrophy property\u201d.</p> <p>Sitting alongside rare wine, coloured diamonds and old masters, a full-floor apartment in a pencil tower with a view of Central Park makes a fine addition to the investor\u2019s trophy cabinet. Except it is not just a trinket in a safe. It is a very large presence on the skyline for all to endure.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The impact of this new species of tower hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by the Municipal Art Society of New York (Mas), a non-profit organisation that has been campaigning to protect the character of the city since the 1890s. They have published a series of <a href=\"https://www.mas.org/initiatives/accidental-skyline\" title=\"\">Accidental Skyline</a> reports over the last few years, lobbying for the planning process to be opened up to proper scrutiny.</p> <p>\u201cThe first time most New Yorkers heard about this new crop of towers was when they saw them under construction,\u201d says Tara Kelly of the Mas. \u201cThey are mostly built \u2018as-of-right\u2019, meaning the developers don\u2019t need planning permission and they don\u2019t need to notify anyone. There was no public review and no community engagement, and yet these buildings will be casting huge shadows across Central Park for years to come.\u201d</p> <p>Complaining about shadows in a city of skyscrapers might sound perverse, but Mas has a long and illustrious history of battling shadows and shaping the form of New York.</p> <p>The group was instrumental in passing the city\u2019s first zoning laws, spurred on by the arrival of <a href=\"https://www.skyscraper.org/EXHIBITIONS/WOOLWORTH/nw_equitable.php\" title=\"\">the Equitable Building</a> in 1915, a 40-storey stone Goliath that filled an entire city block in Lower Manhattan and rose hundreds of feet up from the sidewalk. It is now a cherished landmark, but at the time it was monstrously out of context \u2013 a great mountain that blocked the flow of air, dumped thousands of pedestrians on to the narrow pavements and cast a seven-acre shadow over the neighbourhood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d54d9c01cdd82fecfdcafa97fe0a56203e94ba72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d54d9c01cdd82fecfdcafa97fe0a56203e94ba72/0_0_2048_2048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The tower at 432 Park Avenue in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The tower at 432 Park Avenue in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: dbox/CIM Group &amp; Macklowe Properties</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The following year, the city adopted the 1916 Zoning Resolution to regulate the massing of buildings, incorporating \u201csetback\u201d requirements to allow more light and air to reach the street. The code introduced the idea of the \u201csky exposure plane\u201d, an imaginary envelope that slopes back from the street at a designated angle, which a building cannot penetrate, forcing towers to step back as they rise. In the 1920s, architectural draughtsman Hugh Ferriss created <a href=\"https://www.skyscraper.org/EXHIBITIONS/FUTURE_CITY/NEW_YORK_MODERN/walkthrough_1916.php\" title=\"\">a series of dramatic perspectives</a> to demonstrate the sculptural consequences of the zoning law, depicting progressively chiselled volumes, resulting in what would become the classic style of the golden age of skyscrapers.</p> <p>Little changed until 1961, when the zoning resolution was overhauled. The <a href=\"https://jorgefontan.com/floor-area-ratio-zoning-far\" title=\"\">concept of floor area ratio</a> (FAR) was introduced as a tool to control bulk and density, setting a maximum ratio of the building\u2019s total floor area to the size of the lot. An FAR of 10, for example, means you can build 10 times the floor area of the lot, in whatever configuration: a 10-storey building that fills the lot, or a 20 storey building on half the lot, etc.</p> <p>The revamped laws also introduced the curious notion of <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/plans/transferable-development-rights/transferable-development-rights.page\" title=\"\">transferable development rights</a> (TDRs), also known as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/realestate/the-great-race-for-manhattan-air-rights.html\">\u201cair rights\u201d</a> \u2013 a mechanism that allows landowners to buy the unused air space of their neighbours and add it on to their own lot. It is the ultimate free-market planning clause: if your neighbour is not exploiting their potential to go skywards, you can buy it off them and make your building even taller. It seems fitting that in the cut-throat capital of capitalism, even the air is for sale.</p> <p>Crucially, the law specifies that the properties must share at least 10ft of boundary, but there is no limit on how many connected lots can be assembled, leading to a situation where a developer can snake their way around a block, piecing together a complex jigsaw puzzle of adjoining lots, buying up neighbour after neighbour\u2019s spare air in secret. It has become one of the most lucrative currencies: in some cases, developers have paid the same price per square foot <a href=\"https://www.cityrealty.com/nyc/market-insight/features/future-nyc/understanding-power-air-rights/2923\" title=\"\">for air rights</a> as they did to buy the land itself.</p> <p>Another law, introduced in 1968, allows designated landmark buildings to sell their air rights across the street or down the block, spawning odd little-and-large pairings around the city. It was intended as a means of compensating historic buildings for the potential financial losses stemming from their landmark status (which severely restricts alterations), and allowing the city to skirt any financial responsibility itself. The result is a very New York scenario: great megaliths loom above tiny historic fragments, perversely protecting them in perpetuity in the process.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ae74273b1faf6da2ddd254430d251736abc12971\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae74273b1faf6da2ddd254430d251736abc12971/1104_0_7752_3702/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A graphic showing 159 sites in Manhattan that could potentially accommodate a residential skyscraper of 600ft or taller.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"478\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A graphic showing 159 sites in Manhattan that could potentially accommodate a residential skyscraper of 600ft or taller.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KPF Urban Interface</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such Faustian bargains are nothing new. In the 1970s, Donald Trump paid $5m for the air rights above the landmarked Tiffany building on Fifth Avenue, which, along with various other deals, allowed him to inflate what would have been a 20-storey building into the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/02/nyregion/donald-trump-tower-heights.html\">58-storey Trump Tower</a>. Twenty years later, he stockpiled air rights from at least seven low-rise properties in Midtown Manhattan and piled them up to create the 70-storey black glass box of Trump World Tower.</p> <p>But these negotiations pale in comparison to what has happened over the last decade. The parade of poles that have sprouted along 57th Street (AKA Billionaires\u2019 Row) on the southern edge of Central Park, represent some of the most fiendishly complex and aggressively litigious dealing the city has ever seen. Gary Barnett, founder of Extell Development Corporation, took 15 years to assemble the property and air rights for <a href=\"https://one57.com/\" title=\"\">One 57</a>, one of the first of the new generation of super-tall residential towers, a garish blue-speckled shaft designed by Christian de Portzamparc, completed in 2014. He took another decade negotiating nearly a dozen further acquisitions to put together the 1.2m square feet of development rights he needed to build Central Park Tower. It was probably time well spent: the project will reportedly have a total sales value of $4.4bn, making it the most expensive residential building in New York\u2019s history. \u201cOur strength is assembling land,\u201d says Barnett. \u201cOn that, we\u2019re Number One.\u201d</p> <p>Part of the assembly involved the controversial acquisition of the air above the neighbouring <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/2014/02/21/league-of-their-own-art-students-members-sue-to-block-extell-tower/\" title=\"\">Art Students League</a>, an elegant French Renaissance-style building from 1892. In order to get the best views of the park, the tower now cantilevers out over its neighbour, a 400-metre cliff face of luxury flats hovering ominously above its decorative stone balustrade. The strange pairing will forever stand as a typically Manhattanite monument to the messy compromise of development-rights trading.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>A few doors down to the east stands a similarly odd couple. The newly restored white limestone facade of the <a href=\"https://www.cityrealty.com/nyc/market-insight/features/future-nyc/the-lustrous-history-steinway-hall-see-progress-supertall-annex-111-west-57th/17861\" title=\"\">1920s Steinway Hall</a>, where Sergei Rachmaninoff, Nina Simone and Marvin Gaye all played, now cowers at the foot of one of the most audacious structures ever conceived.</p> <p>The former piano showroom and recital hall will soon serve as the luxury health club for residents of <a href=\"http://111w57.com\" title=\"\">111 West 57th Street</a>, a 435-metre tall, 18-metre wide wafer of a building. With a slenderness ratio of 1:24, it is set to be the skinniest skyscraper in the world. Try making that stand up in gale-force winds.</p> <p>\u201cThe 800-tonne tuned mass damper helps,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.shoparc.com/projects/111-west-57-street-2\" title=\"\">Chris Sharples of SHoP Architects</a>, the firm responsible for the design, referring to the gigantic weight at the top of the tower that will help to stabilise the building. Making this gossamer-thin strip of a tower stand up has some strange consequences inside. In order to leave the north and south facades open for uninterrupted views, the two bracing concrete side walls are up to a metre thick, creating deep arrow-slit windows \u2013 perhaps an appropriate aesthetic for these fortified luxury bunkers in the sky.</p> <p>Right out of one of Hugh Ferriss\u2019s drawings, the tower\u2019s tapering silhouette is a literal expression of the required set-back angle along 57th Street. (The developers even hung <a href=\"https://ny.curbed.com/2018/9/14/17859028/midtown-new-york-111-west-57th-street-sales-launch\" title=\"\">a Ferriss-inspired image</a> of the building over the scaffolding, perhaps the first time a planning diagram has been used as a marketing tool.) But rather than stepping the building back in big chunks, the architects have reduced the mass in slender increments, giving it the feathered look of a quill pen. They have taken inspiration from New York\u2019s cherished skyscrapers of the early 20th century, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2016/jul/20/skyscraper-city-manhattan-how-built-new-york-public-library-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Woolworth</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/jan/10/chrysler-building-art-deco-sale-new-york-photos\" title=\"\">Chrysler</a> buildings, cladding the concrete side walls with panels of moulded terracotta and bronze, which form shimmering waves when seen from the street below. It is one of the few hyper-luxury apartment buildings that actually has the ethereal aura you would expect \u2013 a fitting costume for the eyrie of an untouchable elite.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"be6a2db4489ff54db8d21fbf6f56c619135062a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be6a2db4489ff54db8d21fbf6f56c619135062a8/0_90_4800_2879/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A CGI rendering of the future Manhattan skyline around Central Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A CGI rendering of the future Manhattan skyline around Central Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ondel Hylton/cityrealty.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe were thinking the very top would make a cool aviary,\u201d adds Sharples, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d There may be no aviary, but there is practically everything else.</p> <p>To stand in the show apartment across the road is to be transported to another realm. A miniature bronze model of the tower serves as the apartment\u2019s front door handle, which turns with an expensive clunk to reveal a lair of untold opulence. It is a place where the walls of his-and-hers dressing rooms are covered with leather and velvet, where sinks are carved from solid blocks of Italian onyx, where walnut drawers are lined with ostrich skin.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve used the most expensive and hard-to-find stone in the world,\u201d says Michael Stern, founder of JDS Development Group, as he pats one of the solid marble kitchen counters. A thick-set 39-year-old with a soft Long Island accent, Stern makes for a disarming luxury real-estate tycoon. He is a passionate enthusiast for the city\u2019s architectural history, and seems genuinely eager to add to the canon. He extolls his tower as a monument of world firsts, from the acres of rare book-matched stone and timber to \u201cthe most complicated facade ever attempted\u201d. Leading me around the palatial apartment, he points out how the shower doorframe is made of solid bronze, how the kitchen cupboards are single pieces of curved glass, how the spiral staircase has solid stone treads. At least the weight of all the marble should be enough to keep the tower from tipping over.</p> <p>So what does Stern make of the criticisms that these silos of billionaires are casting ever-longer shadows across Central Park, and that the negotiations happen well away from public scrutiny?</p> <p>\u201cThe shadow argument has been debunked completely,\u201d he insists. \u201cShorter, blockier buildings cast bigger, long-lasting shadows than tall slender buildings, which have longer shadows that move more quickly. If all of the air rights were built out in slender towers, rather than blocky buildings, the shadow impact would be much less.

      "bodyText": "It is rare in the history of architecture for a new type of building to emerge. The Romans\u2019 discovery of concrete birthed the great domes and fortifications of its empire. The Victorians\u2019 development of steel led to an era of majestic bridges and vaulted train sheds. The American invention of the elevator created the first skyscrapers in Chicago. Now, we are seeing a new type of structure that perfectly embodies the 21st-century age of technical ingenuity and extreme inequality. A heady confluence of engineering prowess, zoning loopholes and an unparalleled concentration of personal wealth have together spawned a new species of super-tall, super-skinny, super-expensive spire. Any visitor to New York over the past few years will have witnessed this curious new breed of pencil-thin tower. Poking up above the Manhattan skyline like etiolated beanpoles, they seem to defy the laws of both gravity and commercial sense. They stand like naked elevator shafts awaiting their floors, raw extrusions of capital piled up until it hits the clouds. These towers are not only the product of advances in construction technology \u2013 and a global surfeit of super-rich buyers \u2013 but a zoning policy that allows a developer to acquire unused airspace nearby, add it to their own lot, and erect a vast structure without any kind of public review process taking place. The face of New York is changing at a rate not seen for decades, and the deals that are driving it are all happening behind closed doors. The results range from the sublime to the ridiculous, or even both at once. There is 432 Park Avenue, a surreal square tube of white concrete that appears to shoot twice as high as anything around it, its endless Cartesian grid of windows framing worlds of solid marble bathtubs and climate-controlled wine cellars within. It is the most elegant of the new towers, recalling the minimalist sculptures of Sol LeWitt, although its architect, Raphael Vi\u00f1oly, says it was inspired by a trash can. He can clearly turn garbage into gold, given the penthouse sold for $95m (\u00a372m). It is the tallest residential building in the world, but it won\u2019t be for long. The sturdy trunk of Central Park Tower is rising nearby \u2013 a great glass hulk that will soon steal the crown for the most vertiginous residences on the planet. Designed by Adrian Smith and Gordon Gill, architects of Dubai\u2019s Burj Khalifa, the tower will form a dizzying stack of superlatives, with the biggest pools, highest health club and farthest-reaching views in town. You might even be able to peer into your neighbouring oligarch\u2019s flat, given how close the next-door tower is squeezed. Standing right across the street, 220 Central Park South aims to be the gentleman of the bunch. A neo-art deco tower clad in silvery Alabama limestone, with set-back terraces and ornamental metalwork, it is the work of Robert AM Stern, expedient purveyor of whatever style his client wants, from Spanish revival to Qing dynasty. \u201cArchitecture is a banquet,\u201d Stern tells me, \u201cand most architects are starving to death.\u201d He says that \u201cunlike some of its neighbours now under development\u201d, his design \u201cwill belong to the family of buildings that have framed Central Park for generations\u201d. The dapper costume has paid off: some apartments in his tower have gone for more than $10,000 per square foot. The penthouse was recently acquired by a hedge-fund billionaire for $238m, making it the most expensive home ever sold in the US. Form has always followed finance in New York, and this latest architectural byproduct of excess global wealth is no exception. Building very tall has been technically possible for some time, but it hasn\u2019t made much commercial sense: the higher you go, the cost of building often exceeds the returns. That is, until now. Like leggy plants given too much fertiliser, these buildings are a symptom of a city irrigated with too much money. The world\u2019s population of ultra-high-net-worth individuals, a super-elite with assets of at least $30m, has now mushroomed beyond 250,000 people, all in need of somewhere to store their wealth. More than a third of them are based in North America, while those from riskier economic climes favour New York real estate as one of the safest places to park their cash. Since the 2008 global financial crisis, luxury housing has become a new world currency, providing investors with both a tangible asset and a certain cachet that can\u2019t be found in stocks and hedge funds. The continued volatility of financial markets has spurred buyers to seek safe havens in super-prime real estate, from London to New York and Hong Kong, begetting stratospheric prices and minting a whole new category that defies the usual rules of the marketplace: the \u201ctrophy property\u201d. Sitting alongside rare wine, coloured diamonds and old masters, a full-floor apartment in a pencil tower with a view of Central Park makes a fine addition to the investor\u2019s trophy cabinet. Except it is not just a trinket in a safe. It is a very large presence on the skyline for all to endure. * * * The impact of this new species of tower hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by the Municipal Art Society of New York (Mas), a non-profit organisation that has been campaigning to protect the character of the city since the 1890s. They have published a series of Accidental Skyline reports over the last few years, lobbying for the planning process to be opened up to proper scrutiny. \u201cThe first time most New Yorkers heard about this new crop of towers was when they saw them under construction,\u201d says Tara Kelly of the Mas. \u201cThey are mostly built \u2018as-of-right\u2019, meaning the developers don\u2019t need planning permission and they don\u2019t need to notify anyone. There was no public review and no community engagement, and yet these buildings will be casting huge shadows across Central Park for years to come.\u201d Complaining about shadows in a city of skyscrapers might sound perverse, but Mas has a long and illustrious history of battling shadows and shaping the form of New York. The group was instrumental in passing the city\u2019s first zoning laws, spurred on by the arrival of the Equitable Building in 1915, a 40-storey stone Goliath that filled an entire city block in Lower Manhattan and rose hundreds of feet up from the sidewalk. It is now a cherished landmark, but at the time it was monstrously out of context \u2013 a great mountain that blocked the flow of air, dumped thousands of pedestrians on to the narrow pavements and cast a seven-acre shadow over the neighbourhood. The following year, the city adopted the 1916 Zoning Resolution to regulate the massing of buildings, incorporating \u201csetback\u201d requirements to allow more light and air to reach the street. The code introduced the idea of the \u201csky exposure plane\u201d, an imaginary envelope that slopes back from the street at a designated angle, which a building cannot penetrate, forcing towers to step back as they rise. In the 1920s, architectural draughtsman Hugh Ferriss created a series of dramatic perspectives to demonstrate the sculptural consequences of the zoning law, depicting progressively chiselled volumes, resulting in what would become the classic style of the golden age of skyscrapers. Little changed until 1961, when the zoning resolution was overhauled. The concept of floor area ratio (FAR) was introduced as a tool to control bulk and density, setting a maximum ratio of the building\u2019s total floor area to the size of the lot. An FAR of 10, for example, means you can build 10 times the floor area of the lot, in whatever configuration: a 10-storey building that fills the lot, or a 20 storey building on half the lot, etc. The revamped laws also introduced the curious notion of transferable development rights (TDRs), also known as \u201cair rights\u201d \u2013 a mechanism that allows landowners to buy the unused air space of their neighbours and add it on to their own lot. It is the ultimate free-market planning clause: if your neighbour is not exploiting their potential to go skywards, you can buy it off them and make your building even taller. It seems fitting that in the cut-throat capital of capitalism, even the air is for sale. Crucially, the law specifies that the properties must share at least 10ft of boundary, but there is no limit on how many connected lots can be assembled, leading to a situation where a developer can snake their way around a block, piecing together a complex jigsaw puzzle of adjoining lots, buying up neighbour after neighbour\u2019s spare air in secret. It has become one of the most lucrative currencies: in some cases, developers have paid the same price per square foot for air rights as they did to buy the land itself. Another law, introduced in 1968, allows designated landmark buildings to sell their air rights across the street or down the block, spawning odd little-and-large pairings around the city. It was intended as a means of compensating historic buildings for the potential financial losses stemming from their landmark status (which severely restricts alterations), and allowing the city to skirt any financial responsibility itself. The result is a very New York scenario: great megaliths loom above tiny historic fragments, perversely protecting them in perpetuity in the process. Such Faustian bargains are nothing new. In the 1970s, Donald Trump paid $5m for the air rights above the landmarked Tiffany building on Fifth Avenue, which, along with various other deals, allowed him to inflate what would have been a 20-storey building into the 58-storey Trump Tower. Twenty years later, he stockpiled air rights from at least seven low-rise properties in Midtown Manhattan and piled them up to create the 70-storey black glass box of Trump World Tower. But these negotiations pale in comparison to what has happened over the last decade. The parade of poles that have sprouted along 57th Street (AKA Billionaires\u2019 Row) on the southern edge of Central Park, represent some of the most fiendishly complex and aggressively litigious dealing the city has ever seen. Gary Barnett, founder of Extell Development Corporation, took 15 years to assemble the property and air rights for One 57, one of the first of the new generation of super-tall residential towers, a garish blue-speckled shaft designed by Christian de Portzamparc, completed in 2014. He took another decade negotiating nearly a dozen further acquisitions to put together the 1.2m square feet of development rights he needed to build Central Park Tower. It was probably time well spent: the project will reportedly have a total sales value of $4.4bn, making it the most expensive residential building in New York\u2019s history. \u201cOur strength is assembling land,\u201d says Barnett. \u201cOn that, we\u2019re Number One.\u201d Part of the assembly involved the controversial acquisition of the air above the neighbouring Art Students League, an elegant French Renaissance-style building from 1892. In order to get the best views of the park, the tower now cantilevers out over its neighbour, a 400-metre cliff face of luxury flats hovering ominously above its decorative stone balustrade. The strange pairing will forever stand as a typically Manhattanite monument to the messy compromise of development-rights trading. * * * A few doors down to the east stands a similarly odd couple. The newly restored white limestone facade of the 1920s Steinway Hall, where Sergei Rachmaninoff, Nina Simone and Marvin Gaye all played, now cowers at the foot of one of the most audacious structures ever conceived. The former piano showroom and recital hall will soon serve as the luxury health club for residents of 111 West 57th Street, a 435-metre tall, 18-metre wide wafer of a building. With a slenderness ratio of 1:24, it is set to be the skinniest skyscraper in the world. Try making that stand up in gale-force winds. \u201cThe 800-tonne tuned mass damper helps,\u201d says Chris Sharples of SHoP Architects, the firm responsible for the design, referring to the gigantic weight at the top of the tower that will help to stabilise the building. Making this gossamer-thin strip of a tower stand up has some strange consequences inside. In order to leave the north and south facades open for uninterrupted views, the two bracing concrete side walls are up to a metre thick, creating deep arrow-slit windows \u2013 perhaps an appropriate aesthetic for these fortified luxury bunkers in the sky. Right out of one of Hugh Ferriss\u2019s drawings, the tower\u2019s tapering silhouette is a literal expression of the required set-back angle along 57th Street. (The developers even hung a Ferriss-inspired image of the building over the scaffolding, perhaps the first time a planning diagram has been used as a marketing tool.) But rather than stepping the building back in big chunks, the architects have reduced the mass in slender increments, giving it the feathered look of a quill pen. They have taken inspiration from New York\u2019s cherished skyscrapers of the early 20th century, such as the Woolworth and Chrysler buildings, cladding the concrete side walls with panels of moulded terracotta and bronze, which form shimmering waves when seen from the street below. It is one of the few hyper-luxury apartment buildings that actually has the ethereal aura you would expect \u2013 a fitting costume for the eyrie of an untouchable elite. \u201cWe were thinking the very top would make a cool aviary,\u201d adds Sharples, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d There may be no aviary, but there is practically everything else. To stand in the show apartment across the road is to be transported to another realm. A miniature bronze model of the tower serves as the apartment\u2019s front door handle, which turns with an expensive clunk to reveal a lair of untold opulence. It is a place where the walls of his-and-hers dressing rooms are covered with leather and velvet, where sinks are carved from solid blocks of Italian onyx, where walnut drawers are lined with ostrich skin. \u201cWe\u2019ve used the most expensive and hard-to-find stone in the world,\u201d says Michael Stern, founder of JDS Development Group, as he pats one of the solid marble kitchen counters. A thick-set 39-year-old with a soft Long Island accent, Stern makes for a disarming luxury real-estate tycoon. He is a passionate enthusiast for the city\u2019s architectural history, and seems genuinely eager to add to the canon. He extolls his tower as a monument of world firsts, from the acres of rare book-matched stone and timber to \u201cthe most complicated facade ever attempted\u201d. Leading me around the palatial apartment, he points out how the shower doorframe is made of solid bronze, how the kitchen cupboards are single pieces of curved glass, how the spiral staircase has solid stone treads. At least the weight of all the marble should be enough to keep the tower from tipping over. So what does Stern make of the criticisms that these silos of billionaires are casting ever-longer shadows across Central Park, and that the negotiations happen well away from public scrutiny? \u201cThe shadow argument has been debunked completely,\u201d he insists. \u201cShorter, blockier buildings cast bigger, long-lasting shadows than tall slender buildings, which have longer shadows that move more quickly. If all of the air rights were built out in slender towers, rather than blocky buildings, the shadow impact would be much less. The density is finite, so isn\u2019t it better that it\u2019s used in a taller, slender building, rather than a short, fatter one?\u201d As for the lack of public review, he is adamant that it is the foundation of the city\u2019s success. \u201cOne of the great things about New York, compared to other cities, is that, as a developer, you can rely on as-of-right zoning: there is a certainty about your building rights. What makes the economy go is the fact there isn\u2019t a discretionary review of everything.\u201d When I raise the opacity of air rights transfers, and the problem that no neighbour knows who is selling, or if they will see a 30- or 90-storey tower as a result of their sale, he grins: \u201cThat\u2019s part of the game of assemblage.\u201d * * * This love of Manhattan\u2019s no-holds-barred market logic is shared by Carol Willis, director of the city\u2019s Skyscraper Museum, which staged an exhibition on the super-slender towers when they first began to appear in 2013. When asked in an interview if there should be any change to planning policy in response to the rash of super-talls, her response was immediate: \u201cNo, absolutely not.\u201d She says campaigners fail to understand that these towers \u201cwill not add one single square foot of built density to the city\u201d, given that allowable density is finite. \u201cIt\u2019s a cap-and-trade system,\u201d she says, so once air rights are transferred from a low-rise lot, it will stay low for ever. The rules merely allow potential floor area to be shifted, not created. As for the accusation that the buildings will remain empty, sold to a class of people who won\u2019t live in them anyway, she makes an interesting comparison with London, where swaths of Kensington and Chelsea stand eerily quiet for much of the year, having been flogged off to overseas investors. \u201cConcentrating more people, even if they\u2019re billionaires, in towers to keep neighbourhoods tight and active is a much smarter way to add space to the city,\u201d she says, \u201crather than to displace people on the ground plane and move them further out \u2026 The problem of people having more money should be addressed by taxes and public policy, not by restricting purchases on multi-million dollar apartments.\u201d New York\u2019s inclusionary housing policy goes a small way to redressing the balance: developers can build taller in exchange for funding affordable housing elsewhere. Like the UK\u2019s Section 106 agreements, the policy allows at least some bounty to be creamed off from these steroidal totems for the public good. Central Park Tower, for example, gained 90,000 sq feet after it bought the rights from another developer\u2019s affordable housing scheme, while JDS contributed $9m to affordable housing in return for a bonus of 20,000 sq ft at 111 West 57th Street. A good deal of extra height can also be added to these super-talls simply by leaving gaping voids in the body of the towers. While the zoning system places a cap on floor area, there is no limit on the actual height of each floor, nor are technical floors counted in the FAR calculations. The result is huge areas devoted to \u201cmechanical\u201d space: 432 Park Avenue enjoys more than 90 metres (300 linear feet) of mechanical void, while 111 West 57th St has a 85ft-high ground floor lobby. As Michael Stern puts it: \u201cThere\u2019s a finite amount of floor area you can work with, so we shed it from below and put it up top.\u201d The city planning department has remained steadfast against calls for further transparency, although pressure for change is growing in some quarters. In October 2018, a city council member introduced a new bill to require the department of parks and recreation to \u201cestablish a task force to study the effect of shadows cast on public parks by buildings constructed in the vicinity of such parks\u201d, something that Mas has been advocating for years. * * * Many in the industry say any such measures are too late to the game \u2013 that the super-tall boom has already reached its peak, and the available air rights have been used up. But detailed analysis by both Mas and KPF shows that is simply not true. There are millions of square metres of unused development rights remaining across New York, and around 100 sites that could still accommodate a super-tall tower. Mas is tracking more than 100 proposals for super-tall towers (taller than 180 metres) in the pipeline, from a Russian-backed project at 262 Fifth Avenue \u2013 likely to block views of the Empire State building from Madison Square Park \u2013 to 80 South Street, a vertiginous needle for Lower Manhattan, whose 426,000 sq ftof air rights account for almost half its height. There are many more on the way. Brooklyn is the latest battleground and even Harlem is being touted as the next frontier. It is important to remember that most of New York\u2019s cherished skyscrapers were greeted with dismay when they first appeared, and there are some architectural marvels amongst the latest crop of towers. But as the gap between the city\u2019s rich and poor yawns ever wider and residents are being pushed further out of the city, with public housing is on its knees, it could be time to interrogate the unexpected impact of the 1960s zoning laws, 60 years on. There are some simple steps that could make New Yorkers feel they have a say. Mas has called for community boards to be notified when air rights transfers occur, and has suggested a public review for transfers above a certain threshold. There could even be a limit on how much of the city\u2019s air you can buy. \u201cWe don\u2019t object to any one of these buildings in particular,\u201d says Tara Kelly. \u201cThe process is our main concern. We could talk about what the skyline means, about shadow impacts, about how much luxury housing we think is appropriate when we\u2019re in an affordable housing crisis. There would be a forum for all those voices. As it stands, there is zero.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 February.

Guaid\u00f3 is part of an opposition that never stopped challenging Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s popular legitimacy even in his heyday, and who naturally doubled down as soon as the less assertive Maduro took office. The challenges to Maduro\u2019s legitimacy began the moment he was elected. His presidential opponent, Henrique Capriles, labelled the 2013 election a fraud (without providing any supporting evidence). Capriles called on his followers to ventilate their \u201canger\u201d in the streets, a move resulting in the killing of a number of Chavistas. In January 2014 Guaid\u00f3\u2019s political party, Voluntad Popular, launched a nationwide insurrectionary movement aimed at forcing Maduro out of office. This was only nine months into Maduro\u2019s term, and long before the country faced any serious economic or social problems.

In 2013, the government\u2019s strategy of using oil revenues to boost public investment and income redistribution was facing serious challenges.

The process went incredibly smoothly and I even got a nationality certificate in the post. My wife doesn\u2019t have one of those, so I joke that this makes me more Swedish than her.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Britain no longer feels like home, as it has rejected Europe and I have not</p> <footer> <cite>Matt Hurley</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Jain embodies the ludicrousness of May\u2019s denigration of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/09/theresa-may-rejection-of-enlightenment-values\" title=\"\">\u201ccitizens of nowhere\u201d</a>. \u201cSwedes used to ask me, before the referendum, if I would take Swedish nationality, because I was eligible anyway,\u201d he says. \u201cI always answered that I didn\u2019t need it and I saw it as a practical question, as opposed to one about identity. But after the referendum I realised that it is about identity as well. I feel Swedish and British, European and Indian. I don\u2019t see that as contradictory, although England versus Sweden in the World Cup was tricky.\u201d</p> <p>Some people didn\u2019t even wait for the referendum result before they started the process of getting a second passport. Richard Ventham, a 44-year-old who works in the pharmaceutical industry, began investigating dual citizenship when David Cameron announced he would hold a referendum. Having lived in Belgium since 2003, he says: \u201cI couldn\u2019t trust the xenophobic British public to make the right decision. I became Belgian in March 2016 and haven\u2019t had a sleepless night since. I\u2019m European \u2013 and no xenophobic, closed-minded, small majority can take that away from me.\u201d</p> <p>Ventham is rather more emotional and committed a European than most of the bloodless technocrats who argued for remain in 2016. He describes the potential loss of freedom of movement as a \u201ctragedy\u201d. \u201cMy wife and children are Belgian. I suppose some people think I jumped the gun to apply prior to the referendum, but I could read the runes and the hysteria in the tabloid newspapers and wanted my status assured. I cling on to hope of a second referendum to reverse the decision, but as I\u2019ve lived in Belgium for more than 15 years I\u2019m no longer eligible to vote in it.

Then you need another appointment to get your passport.\u201d</p> <p>He believes it will be worth it. \u201cIt\u2019s partly about career security,\u201d he says. \u201cBut for me it\u2019s mainly about how I feel about my identity. When you go to the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand \u2013 crossing the border, you\u2019re made to feel like an outsider because you don\u2019t have the right to be there. I don\u2019t want to feel like that going to Europe.\u201d</p> <p>For many people, it is a practical issue, too. Jane Johnson, a 55-year-old academic in Bologna, Italy, has just completed an application for Italian citizenship. She was motivated, she says, in part by fear of losing \u201caccess to the wonderful state health service in Bologna\u201d.</p> <p>But I believe Gompertz\u2019s more emotive argument resonates. For almost 50 years, despite the half-heartedness of the British political class, we have been citizens of Europe, with unfettered access to that beautiful, varied, culturally rich continent. Some part of us could claim to be French or Spanish, Italian or German. We had fought many wars with our neighbours; now we could enjoy a long peace and claim a stake in their wonderful countries.</p> <p>Brexit may change this for ever. While my wife and son are safe in their new nationalities, the angry Welshman in our family \u2013 me \u2013 is about to lose his EU passport and the fantasy that he is Spanish. Is this really the end of the dream? If I set up a small business in Plovdiv, how long will it be before I qualify for Bulgarian citizenship?</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 February 2019 to more accurately set out the position on dual citizenship in Spain and Poland.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Brexit is turning the UK into a country of dual citizens. An Irish grandparent is now the most prized possession in the land, giving the proud owner the right to an Irish (and thus an EU) passport. Applications for Irish passports are surging \u2013 200,000 Britons applied in 2018. About half of these were from Northern Ireland \u2013 anyone born on the island of Ireland before 2005 and anyone born there since with a parent who is Irish, British or \u201centitled to live in Northern Ireland or the Irish state without restriction on their residency\u201d is entitled to Irish citizenship. The other half are Britons living outside Ireland who have suddenly discovered an affinity with the birthplace of a parent or a grandparent. The number of applications has doubled since the referendum, with by far the greater increase coming from outside the island of Ireland. That burgundy passport is now extremely highly prized. Neale Richmond, the chair of the Irish Seanad\u2019s Brexit committee, has claimed that at least 10% of the British population outside Northern Ireland are eligible for an Irish passport. It is a captivating statistic that is almost impossible to verify, but if it is even vaguely true and Brexit goes badly, we can expect the number of Irish citizens to swell significantly in the next few years. My family is contributing to this: my son, through my wife, has an Irish grandmother and has claimed Irish citizenship. This year, he may visit his new homeland for the first time. His grandmother, who was born near Cork, came over to join the war effort against Hitler and never returned. Eighty years on, her daughter and grandson retain a foothold in the EU and a place in the postwar vision of a unified Europe. The Mosses are not alone. Indeed, the pursuit of dual nationality by Britons disaffected by Brexit or seeking to protect their residential, health or working rights is happening all over Europe. When we asked Guardian readers who have applied for citizenship elsewhere to get in touch, more than 1,100 people replied. Many were applying for Irish, German, French, Belgian and Swedish citizenship, but plenty of other countries were represented, including Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Hungary and Malta. There were a surprising number of applications for Latvian citizenship, some from descendants of Latvians who fled to the UK following the Soviet takeover of their country in 1944. John Gribbon, an IT manager who lives and works in England, is one of the hundreds of thousands who have become Irish recently \u2013 his citizenship was granted in 2018. \u201cI wanted the opportunity to work wherever I chose in Europe and did not welcome the fact that the opportunity had been removed by the Brexiteers,\u201d he says. Gribbon\u2019s grandfather, who died in 1964, was born in Belfast in 1915, served in the British army and worked as a sheet-metal worker in the Tyne shipyards. He had nine children and \u201clived for their freedom and opportunity\u201d, says 46-year-old Gribbon, who has become an Irish citizen to preserve his own freedom and opportunity. \u201cI had the Willy Wonka ticket 100 years later,\u201d he says. \u201cAlthough I never met him, his parting gift, being an Irishman, was the best present I could ever have. England was my past and will always be part of me as it\u2019s who I am, but Ireland will give me the freedom to be who I want to be.\u201d Matt Hurley, a 22-year-old Earth sciences master\u2019s student at Utrecht University, became an Irish citizen in 2017. \u201cI have always felt that I was Irish, as my father is Irish, while my mother was born in England to Irish parents,\u201d he says. \u201cI had never contemplated getting Irish citizenship, as it felt like I was taking something from a country I have never contributed to.\u201d But now, he says: \u201cBritain no longer feels like home, as it has rejected Europe and I have not.\u201d Of course, there are also practical advantages: \u201cGetting an Irish passport has enabled me to live abroad without the worry of my tuition fees being increased to the same level as non-EU students or having to apply for some kind of student visa.\u201d The statistics on Irish dual citizenship are particularly notable because the number of Britons eligible is far higher than for any other country and the process of applying is straightforward \u2013 automatic and free citizenship for children of people born in Ireland on production of the relevant birth documents; a fee of about \u00a3250 (\u00a3130 for children) to get yourself on the Foreign Births Register if you were born outside Ireland but have an Irish grandparent. However, the same pattern is apparent throughout Europe (except in Spain, which doesn\u2019t permit dual citizenship for Britons resident in the country \u2013 one reason why so many British expats in Spain are likely to return in the event of a no-deal Brexit \u2013 and Poland, which will allow dual citizenship but not formally recognise a second citizenship within its own jurisdiction). The number of UK citizens who applied for German citizenship, for instance, more than doubled in 2017 compared with 2016, rising from 2,865 to 7,493. The number of Britons applying to become German is more than 10 times greater than before the 2016 referendum. One remarkable result of the EU referendum is the number of people whose families fled the Nazis who are now reclaiming German citizenship. \u201cI was born in Palestine in 1944, the child of stateless German-born refugees who had been deprived of their citizenship because they were deemed to be Jewish,\u201d says Nancy Krauss, a retired doctor in East Anglia. \u201cI was brought up only speaking English because my parents wanted us to feel as though we belonged to the UK.

The number of Britons applying for Dutch, Swedish and French citizenship has risen enormously, too. In the absence of any progress on Guy Verhofstadt\u2019s idea to offer Europe-minded Britons associate citizenship of the EU, those who qualify \u2013 by birth, marriage or residence \u2013 for another European country are taking matters into their own hands. In France, Beci Clayton was quick to apply after the referendum result, worried that if she did not her family would find themselves in difficulties.

Married to a Swedish woman and with a two-year-old son, he was worried about his family\u2019s rights in the event of a no-deal Brexit \u2013 and about the rules regarding income levels for spouses if he wanted to relocate to the UK. \u201cI have decided most probably never to return to the UK, as my family doesn\u2019t feel welcome,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a shame, as I\u2019m a UK-qualified teacher with 15 years\u2019 experience, although it has to be said that teaching in Sweden is far less stressful than in the UK.\u201d Romit Jain, a 43-year-old Londoner of Indian heritage, is another Briton who has successfully sought Swedish citizenship. \u201cI applied within a week of the referendum and was granted citizenship within four weeks,\u201d says Jain, who works for a Swedish company and is currently based in South Africa. \u201cI was eligible for Swedish citizenship because I am married to a Swede and had been living there for about five years. The process went incredibly smoothly and I even got a nationality certificate in the post. My wife doesn\u2019t have one of those, so I joke that this makes me more Swedish than her.\u201d Jain embodies the ludicrousness of May\u2019s denigration of \u201ccitizens of nowhere\u201d. \u201cSwedes used to ask me, before the referendum, if I would take Swedish nationality, because I was eligible anyway,\u201d he says. \u201cI always answered that I didn\u2019t need it and I saw it as a practical question, as opposed to one about identity. But after the referendum I realised that it is about identity as well. I feel Swedish and British, European and Indian. I don\u2019t see that as contradictory, although England versus Sweden in the World Cup was tricky.\u201d Some people didn\u2019t even wait for the referendum result before they started the process of getting a second passport. Richard Ventham, a 44-year-old who works in the pharmaceutical industry, began investigating dual citizenship when David Cameron announced he would hold a referendum. Having lived in Belgium since 2003, he says: \u201cI couldn\u2019t trust the xenophobic British public to make the right decision. I became Belgian in March 2016 and haven\u2019t had a sleepless night since. I\u2019m European \u2013 and no xenophobic, closed-minded, small majority can take that away from me.\u201d Ventham is rather more emotional and committed a European than most of the bloodless technocrats who argued for remain in 2016. He describes the potential loss of freedom of movement as a \u201ctragedy\u201d. \u201cMy wife and children are Belgian. I suppose some people think I jumped the gun to apply prior to the referendum, but I could read the runes and the hysteria in the tabloid newspapers and wanted my status assured. I cling on to hope of a second referendum to reverse the decision, but as I\u2019ve lived in Belgium for more than 15 years I\u2019m no longer eligible to vote in it. I\u2019ve been disenfranchised.\u201d Oliver Gompertz, a pilot based in London, is applying for a Maltese passport. \u201cPeople often scoff and ask: \u2018Is that the one you can just buy?\u2019\u201d he says, referring to the countries that offer a fast track to permanent residence and sometimes citizenship if applicants are willing to make a substantial investment in the country. \u201cBut I\u2019m entitled to it through my grandparents.\u201d It has not, however, been a straightforward process: \u201cI started assembling the documentation required more than three years ago and then it was a question of getting appointments with the embassy in London, which took about six months, and then waiting for your application to be processed, which took another 18 months. Then you need another appointment to get your passport.\u201d He believes it will be worth it. \u201cIt\u2019s partly about career security,\u201d he says. \u201cBut for me it\u2019s mainly about how I feel about my identity. When you go to the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand \u2013 crossing the border, you\u2019re made to feel like an outsider because you don\u2019t have the right to be there. I don\u2019t want to feel like that going to Europe.\u201d For many people, it is a practical issue, too. Jane Johnson, a 55-year-old academic in Bologna, Italy, has just completed an application for Italian citizenship. She was motivated, she says, in part by fear of losing \u201caccess to the wonderful state health service in Bologna\u201d. But I believe Gompertz\u2019s more emotive argument resonates. For almost 50 years, despite the half-heartedness of the British political class, we have been citizens of Europe, with unfettered access to that beautiful, varied, culturally rich continent. Some part of us could claim to be French or Spanish, Italian or German. We had fought many wars with our neighbours; now we could enjoy a long peace and claim a stake in their wonderful countries. Brexit may change this for ever. While my wife and son are safe in their new nationalities, the angry Welshman in our family \u2013 me \u2013 is about to lose his EU passport and the fantasy that he is Spanish. Is this really the end of the dream? If I set up a small business in Plovdiv, how long will it be before I qualify for Bulgarian citizenship? Some names have been changed \u2022 This article was amended on 7 February 2019 to more accurately set out the position on dual citizenship in Spain and Poland.",

Harding, a physics graduate from Cambridge who became a billionaire and successful hedge fund manager, has pledged that some of the funds will go to promote access for students from disadvantaged and minority ethnic backgrounds. The donations from the David and Claudia Harding Foundation will include \u00a379m in scholarships and aid to postgraduate PhD students, with a further \u00a320m as financial support for undergraduates. The final \u00a31m will help fund Cambridge\u2019s access programmes aimed at attracting disadvantaged students. \u201cThis extraordinarily generous gift from David and Claudia Harding will be invaluable in sustaining Cambridge\u2019s place among the world\u2019s leading universities and will help to transform our offer to students,\u201d said Stephen Toope, Cambridge\u2019s vice-chancellor. The fund to support postgraduate students, to be known as the Harding Distinguished Postgraduate Scholars Programme, will begin this year. Cambridge said that the programme will fully fund, in perpetuity, more than 100 doctoral students in residence at any one time. \u201cScholarships will be available to the most talented students for research in any discipline and the successful candidates will be offered places at applicable Cambridge colleges,\u201d the university said in a statement. Harding \u2013 whose hedge fund Winton Capital is said to invest more than \u00a320bn \u2013 said: \u201cClaudia and I are very happy to make this gift to Cambridge to help to attract future generations of the world\u2019s outstanding students to research and study there. \u201cCambridge and other British centres of learning have down the ages contributed greatly to improvements in the human condition and can continue in future to address humanity\u2019s great challenges.\u201d A recent investigation by the Guardian found that Cambridge is the wealthiest university in the UK, with a combined \u00a311.8bn in identifiable assets, including \u00a34.9bn held by the central university alone, and \u00a36.9bn held by individual colleges. Harding, 57, studied at St Catharine\u2019s College, Cambridge, graduating with a first-class degree in 1982, before working in the City of London as a stockbroker. In 1997 he founded the Winton Group, and he remains its chief executive. The financier\u2019s most recent high-profile donation was an estimated \u00a33.5m to help fund the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign before the 2016 referendum. The Hardings have previously pledged \u00a320m to the Winton programme for physics at Cambridge university\u2019s prestigious Cavendish laboratory, as well as donations to other leading institutions such as London\u2019s Science Museum, the Crick Institute, and funding for the Harding Centre for Risk Literacy at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin. In historical terms the Harding donation, despite its nominal size, pales in comparison to the $10m donated to Scotland\u2019s universities by Andrew Carnegie in 1902, or the legacies given to Oxford by Cecil Rhodes in 1903, with \u00a34m to establish the famous scholarship that bears his name worth closer to \u00a3500m today. In 2000 the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced a \u00a3130m gift to Cambridge to establish a scholarship fund, the largest single gift of the modern era. In 2012, Michael Moritz and Harriet Heyman donated \u00a375m to Oxford to found the Moritz-Heyman scholarships for disadvantaged undergraduates, with the pair also donating \u00a325m to Christ Church college in 2008. The Canadian investor John McCall MacBain is also likely to have matched Harding\u2019s donation, having made a \u00a375m donation to the Rhodes scholarship trust in 2013 with matching additions that have probably taken it to about \u00a3100m.",

We have amazing rights but nobody wrote those rights so you can bully people. You shouldn\u2019t be talking shit about anybody, that right was made for you to defend yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking up for those who no longer can has become the hallmark of Oliver\u2019s campaigning over the last year, which has seen him and his wife Patricia, Joaquin\u2019s mother, travelling across United States<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/desmond-tutu-awards-peace-prize-parkland-shooting-survivors-n938466\"> and overseas</a>, often in the company of the March for Our Lives student movement and promoting the gun control message of <a href=\"https://changetheref.org/\">Change the Ref.</a></p> <p>Oliver, who was raised by a creative family including photographers, artists and a civil engineer father in his native Venezuela before moving to the US 16 years ago, has produced a series of <a href=\"https://changetheref.org/programs/gun-violence/\">sardonic giant wall murals</a>, attention grabbing<a href=\"https://changetheref.org/photos-everytown-x-the-standard-high-lines-powerful-parkland-17-installation/\"> art installations</a> and even a lifesize three-dimensional printed sculpture of his son.

I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s possible,\u201d Oliver said of himself, his wife and Joaquin\u2019s sister Andrea.</p> <p>\u201cWe decided that what we know, what we learned, we\u2019re going to use it. I\u2019m doing this because it\u2019s my best tool to fix what I think is wrong. This is a problem beyond Parkland.

They have no voice.\u201d</p> <p>Though friends with the other bereaved families of the 14 students and three adults killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school, Oliver, one of the most outspoken members of a group entwined by tragedy, insists he speaks for only himself and his son.</p> <p>Some families have channelled their activism efforts locally, seeking the removal of Broward county\u2019s sheriff and superintendent of schools whom they blame for allowing a 19-year-old former student to return to the campus with an assault rifle (Oliver supports the officials\u2019 removal but does not see a need to celebrate it).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/01/parkland-students-five-ways-fight-gun-violence-2019\">Take action: Parkland students on five ways to fight gun violence in 2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Others have worked with Florida\u2019s Republican politicians and Donald Trump\u2019s administration to pursue legislation intended to harden security in schools, including the<a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-releases-school-safety-report-demands-parkland/story?id=59883062\"> controversial proposal to arm teachers</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI had an invitation to the White House and I said no. There is no reason for me to go,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cSome families were there, there\u2019s that beautiful picture in the Oval Office, Donald Trump sitting in the centre, in a very powerful attitude and the parents of the victims from Parkland standing beside him and showing respect.</p> <p>\u201cFuck that. I don\u2019t play that role, and I don\u2019t play that role because it will be a contradiction to all the things that happened. It\u2019s not about Donald Trump, forget him. But whoever is in the White House, is he part of the solution or not?</p> <p>\u201cThis administration in particular is very attached to the gun lobby, many of the politicians have received donations from the gun lobby and the NRA. So it\u2019s obvious they cannot be part of the solution. Their solution is arming and arming more people. Australia never thought that would be part of the solution, the United Kingdom never thought that, Japan, Canada, never thought that.</p> <p>\u201cOnly in America can a 19-year-old go to a store, buy an AR-15, buy ammunitions, go home, load it, go to school the next day and murder people. Or go to a church, a bank, a yoga salon \u2026 and start shooting people like crazy.\u201d</p> <p>Oliver prefers for his message to be carried in a more personal way, one that reaches politicians, and other people, as individuals. He met Nancy Pelosi in Washington last year, before the Democratic party leader became the House speaker.</p> <p>\u201cI asked her, \u2018Can I call you Nancy? It\u2019s not that I want to be informal, but I want to get close to you in our conversation. Do you have kids, Nancy? Do you have grandkids, Nancy?\u2019 \u2018Yes I do\u2019. \u2018Are they safe now?\u2019 \u2018Yes\u2019. But you don\u2019t know. The same way I didn\u2019t know.</p> <p>\u201cI said I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to be able to solve this, because to my mind it\u2019s a cultural thing. But I\u2019m going to ask you to keep in mind when you have power that there\u2019s a lot of people losing their lives because the politicians aren\u2019t passing the laws they need to be passing.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/20/us-mass-shootings-locations-avoid-bar-church-movie-theater-concert\">Where to avoid if you don\u2019t want to be shot in America | Arwa Mahdawi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Oliver says he continues to talk to the politicians he encounters. \u201cYou are there because we voted for you, because you made promises to us,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be home waiting for you, we\u2019re going to be here reminding you, just in case you forget about it.

It was a pointed response to a comedian who misused his first amendment right in order to bully the teenage survivors of the shooting, according to Oliver, who will attend Tuesday\u2019s evening\u2019s State of the Union address as a guest of Florida Democratic congressman Ted Deutch. \u201cI had an argument with someone [else] when I was in New York, in the middle of the village where all the comedy nightclubs are,\u201d Oliver told the Guardian in an interview last week, before the video produced by Change the Ref went viral. \u201cWe had an issue with this comedian who made jokes about the Parkland kids, this guy said \u2018well, we have the right according to the first amendment of freedom of speech\u2019. \u201cI said that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got wrong. We have amazing rights but nobody wrote those rights so you can bully people. You shouldn\u2019t be talking shit about anybody, that right was made for you to defend yourself.\u201d Speaking up for those who no longer can has become the hallmark of Oliver\u2019s campaigning over the last year, which has seen him and his wife Patricia, Joaquin\u2019s mother, travelling across United States and overseas, often in the company of the March for Our Lives student movement and promoting the gun control message of Change the Ref. Oliver, who was raised by a creative family including photographers, artists and a civil engineer father in his native Venezuela before moving to the US 16 years ago, has produced a series of sardonic giant wall murals, attention grabbing art installations and even a lifesize three-dimensional printed sculpture of his son. The \u201c3D activist\u201d was prominent at a die-in at the US capitol building in Washington DC last month, while Oliver\u2019s self-styled \u201cArtivism\u201d has been displayed in many other cities that have experienced mass shootings, including Las Vegas and Orlando, and in Dallas at the National Rifle Association summit last May. \u201cNone of us were born to hide our face, wash our hands or turn the page and try to be happy and comfortable again. I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s possible,\u201d Oliver said of himself, his wife and Joaquin\u2019s sister Andrea. \u201cWe decided that what we know, what we learned, we\u2019re going to use it. I\u2019m doing this because it\u2019s my best tool to fix what I think is wrong. This is a problem beyond Parkland. By travelling around the nation, around the world, by knowing people that suffered the same situation we suffered on February 14th, that tells me that we have a common issue. \u201cThe good news, if there is such a thing, is that I have a spotlight on my speech, my thoughts and activism. Most people don\u2019t. Today 100 people will die in America because of gun violence. They won\u2019t have the chance to talk to someone like you \u2013 nobody knows them. They have no voice.\u201d Though friends with the other bereaved families of the 14 students and three adults killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school, Oliver, one of the most outspoken members of a group entwined by tragedy, insists he speaks for only himself and his son. Some families have channelled their activism efforts locally, seeking the removal of Broward county\u2019s sheriff and superintendent of schools whom they blame for allowing a 19-year-old former student to return to the campus with an assault rifle (Oliver supports the officials\u2019 removal but does not see a need to celebrate it). Others have worked with Florida\u2019s Republican politicians and Donald Trump\u2019s administration to pursue legislation intended to harden security in schools, including the controversial proposal to arm teachers. \u201cI had an invitation to the White House and I said no. There is no reason for me to go,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cSome families were there, there\u2019s that beautiful picture in the Oval Office, Donald Trump sitting in the centre, in a very powerful attitude and the parents of the victims from Parkland standing beside him and showing respect. \u201cFuck that. I don\u2019t play that role, and I don\u2019t play that role because it will be a contradiction to all the things that happened. It\u2019s not about Donald Trump, forget him. But whoever is in the White House, is he part of the solution or not? \u201cThis administration in particular is very attached to the gun lobby, many of the politicians have received donations from the gun lobby and the NRA. So it\u2019s obvious they cannot be part of the solution. Their solution is arming and arming more people. Australia never thought that would be part of the solution, the United Kingdom never thought that, Japan, Canada, never thought that. \u201cOnly in America can a 19-year-old go to a store, buy an AR-15, buy ammunitions, go home, load it, go to school the next day and murder people. Or go to a church, a bank, a yoga salon \u2026 and start shooting people like crazy.\u201d Oliver prefers for his message to be carried in a more personal way, one that reaches politicians, and other people, as individuals. He met Nancy Pelosi in Washington last year, before the Democratic party leader became the House speaker. \u201cI asked her, \u2018Can I call you Nancy? It\u2019s not that I want to be informal, but I want to get close to you in our conversation. Do you have kids, Nancy? Do you have grandkids, Nancy?\u2019 \u2018Yes I do\u2019. \u2018Are they safe now?\u2019 \u2018Yes\u2019. But you don\u2019t know. The same way I didn\u2019t know. \u201cI said I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to be able to solve this, because to my mind it\u2019s a cultural thing. But I\u2019m going to ask you to keep in mind when you have power that there\u2019s a lot of people losing their lives because the politicians aren\u2019t passing the laws they need to be passing.\u201d Oliver says he continues to talk to the politicians he encounters. \u201cYou are there because we voted for you, because you made promises to us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be home waiting for you, we\u2019re going to be here reminding you, just in case you forget about it. Yesterday 100 people lost their lives. What did you do yesterday? Today 100 people will die. What are you going to do today to help them? Tomorrow, another 100 people will die. What are you planning to do to stop this? \u201cBut still you have these politicians that will never change their mind, not to mention they\u2019re paid for. I paid the biggest price you can pay to be where I am. There\u2019s no way anybody can return me the value of my son, so I\u2019m here forever.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Home Affairs department has defended its border point policies after Four Corners reported at least two cases of Border Force officers at Sydney airport turning back Saudi women attempting to claim asylum. The claims formed part of an investigation by the ABC into women from Saudi Arabia seeking asylum, and covered the case of teenager Rahaf al-Qunun. Al-Qunun fled her family while they travelled to Kuwait, intending to get to Australia on her tourist visa, but was detained at Bangkok. She barricaded herself in her room to avoid deportation, and was granted refugee status by the UNCHR before being resettled by Canada. Australia had said it would consider resettling her but would give no special treatment. Her case brought further attention on other Saudi women who are caught up in the country\u2019s guardianship system \u2013 through which a woman\u2019s life is strictly controlled by male guardians and relatives \u2013 and who seek to escape. Germany-based Saudi activist Dr Taleb Al Abdulmohsen told the program he was contacted by one woman who attempted to enter Australia at Sydney airport in November 2017. \u201cThey suspected she was going to claim asylum,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they said she wasn\u2019t going to be allowed entry and would be returned to Saudi Arabia, she did then ask for asylum. But they didn\u2019t let her make that claim.'\u201d According to the Four Corners report, ABF officers allegedly also questioned young Saudi women about why they were traveling without a male guardian. \u201cThey ask for his phone number to call him,\u201d said Abdulmohsen. \u201cThey also ask her to give them her cell phone and read her SMS, WhatsApp and other chat messages and emails, searching for signs of asylum intent, and they meticulously search the luggage to find any signs of asylum intent such as school certificates.\u201d Human rights lawyer George Newhouse believed the questioning constituted discrimination under the Sex Discrimination Act. \u201cIf Australian government officials have been checking to confirm that a woman\u2019s male guardian has approved her trip to Australia then it\u2019s a shocking practice that the Australian public would find totally offensive and obnoxious in a modern world,\u201d he said. In a statement published on Tuesday, the home affairs department did not address the specific allegations, or the processes of its officers at Australian border points. \u201c[Airline liaison officers] are trained to identify individuals attempting to travel to Australia using fraudulent identity and travel documents, and those who are not travelling on the correct visa,\u201d it said. \u201cIn recent years, they have prevented hundreds of travellers of concern and non-genuine visa holders from boarding flights to Australia.\u201d It said if an overseas person made a claim for protection while offshore, they would be directed towards the UNHCR and other NGOs, and pointed to Australia\u2019s specific support in resettling women at risk of victimisation, harassment or serious abuse because of their gender. \u201cIf these allegations are proved true, they represent a new low in Australia\u2019s callous immigration policy, which has been heavily criticised by the United Nations for its offshore warehousing of asylum seekers and refugees in recent years,\u201d said Human Rights Watch\u2019s Middle East researcher Adam Coogle. \u201cIt is bad enough that Saudi women have nowhere to turn for help in their own country.

Aso, who doubles as finance minister, told a constituency meeting in Fukuoka, south-west Japan, at the weekend that older people were being unfairly singled out to explain the country\u2019s demographic crisis. \u201cThere are lots of weird people who say the elderly are at fault, but that\u2019s incorrect,\u201d Japanese media quoted him as saying. \u201cRather, those who aren\u2019t giving birth to children are the problem.\u201d \u201cThe ageing population, combined with the diminishing number of children, is the grave issue in the mid and long term.\u201d Aso later withdrew the remarks after opposition MPs accused him of insensitivity towards couples who want to have children but are unable to do so.

But he added: \u201cI\u2019d like to withdraw my comments and will be careful with my words in the days ahead.\u201d Aso was speaking after data showed Japan\u2019s population fell by a record 448,000 people in 2018, with the number of births that year declining to 921,000, the lowest since records began more than a century ago. The trend has prompted warnings that spiraling health and welfare costs for older people, coupled with a shrinking workforce, will increase pressure on the world\u2019s third-biggest economy in the decades to come. Experts blame the low birthrate on several factors, including the high financial cost of bringing up children, the lack of childcare provision and notoriously long working hours. Aso, however, is one of several conservative politicians who have blamed couples, and in particular women, for the trend. In June 2018, Toshihiro Nikai, the secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic party [LDP], described couples who decide not to have children as \u201cselfish\u201d, and cited the postwar baby boom as evidence that hardship needn\u2019t be an obstacle to having bigger families. Two months earlier Kanji Kato, an LDP lawmaker, said women should have \u201cat least three children\u201d and warned those who preferred to remain single that they would become a burden on the state. He said he told single women that \u201cif they don\u2019t get married then they won\u2019t be able to have children, and that they\u2019ll end up in a care home paid for with the taxes of other people\u2019s children\u201d. In 2007 the then health minister, Hakuo Yanagisawa, described women as \u201cbirth-giving machines\u201d and said it was their public duty to increase the birthrate. Aso\u2019s praise, in the same recent speech, for Japan\u2019s impressive life expectancy \u2013 which has increased by about 30 years since he was born in the 1940s \u2013 contrasted with comments he made in 2013, when he said older people should be allowed to \u201churry up and die\u201d to relieve pressure on the state.",

      "bodyText": "Anyone who believes that a change of federal government this year is a mere procession will be sobered by the post-Christmas round of political polling showing a distinct tightening in the political race. On its surface little has changed in the political contest over summer. The prime minister has been frothing at the jowls channelling his inner yobo while key members of team have been racing to desert the sinking ship. On his part, opposition leader Bill Shorten has been keeping out of the way of the train wreck and doing what he does best, covering large tracts of Australia, offering residents fun night outs to vent about the world at their local town hall. Good times all round. This week\u2019s Essential Report reinforces the tightening that has been occurring across the major polls. Our latest sample, carried out over the past fortnight sees Labor\u2019s primary vote dropping, the Coalition stable, with small increases to minor parties to wash out at 52-48 two party preferred. For progressives this is not cause to panic. These movements are within the margin of error, which sees any change in a poll of this size within three per cent is not statistically relevant. And yet ... There is a sense that the Coalition is starting to use its advantage of incumbency and control of government advertising \u2013 with the willing support of a conservative media coming to terms with the destruction it wrought last year \u2013 to shift the focus onto an area of natural advantage: the economy. As I have argued ad nauseum, an iron rule of politics is that right of centre political parties are seen as better economic managers than left of centre parties \u2013 regardless of their actual performance. Delivering a pre-election federal budget that trumpets a surplus and splurges a bucket of cash is exactly what a right of centre political party should be doing to maximise its chances of victory at the ballot box. Spicing it with a loud and well-funded, albeit dishonest, scare campaign about Labor\u2019s higher taxes is the icing on the cake. It keeps the debate on the economy and another well-established political line, that taxes are always higher under Labor. Progressives can wring their hands all they like about how base and self-serving the attacks are, but that won\u2019t stop them working: especially if Labor falls into the trap of attempting to respond by campaigning on their superior economic credentials. Because the other line that resonates with our polity is that left of centre parties thrive when the question is not, \u201chow is the economy going?\u201d, but \u201cwho is it going for?\u201d Veteran Washington strategist Vic Fingerhut has been working this formulation for five decades: Who\u2019s on your side, who do you trust to stand up to big business and powerful interests? Who manages the economy in the interests of ordinary working people? These are the defining questions that deliver power to progressive parties. The good news for Labor in the latest round of polling is that the Australian public gets this. When asked who wants to see a Coalition government returned the view is clear \u2013 the big banks, the big miners, big business and the wealthy. Just as clear-cut is the perception that those doing it harder would want to see a Labor government. In this context this week\u2019s banking royal commission \u2013 its findings, the response and the whole tortured saga in getting the thing up in the first place \u2013 is a classic opportunity to reframe the economic debate. As the Coalition dodges and weaves, Labor has the opportunity to offer clarity of purpose, and to position the behaviour of the banks as a totemic example of how the economy has stopped working in the interests of ordinary Australians. Another finding in this week\u2019s poll should provide pause to progressives, currently thinking through how hard to push the Labor opposition pre-election. It\u2019s way too late to be newsworthy, but the extremely low numbers \u2013 just 15% \u2013 endorsing a change of the Australia Day date, should serve as a reality check to activists everywhere.

Perhaps seeking respite from the harsh climes of post-banking royal commission Canberra, the prime minister headed to Townsville on Tuesday to get an up-close look at the unprecedented monsoonal rains ravaging much of north Queensland. And like a man determined to enjoy his summer break whatever the weather, Morrison thrust himself gamely into his northern sojourn. Morrison visited the homes of locals returning to survey the damage from the floods, lauded the \u201ccare and compassion\u201d of those caught up in the disaster and declined to say much of anything about climate change. \u201cMy thinking is the support for Townsville people,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not engaging in broader policy debates today. I\u2019m engaging in the needs of people here on the ground, people in evacuation centres.\u201d But his outfit and transport also drew criticism from the reliably snarky corners of social media. Video of the PM in army fatigues as he travelled through floodwaters abreast some sort of impressive-looking amphibian military hardware was seized upon as evidence Morrison may have been hamming it up slightly for the cameras. To be fair to Morrison, he has faced criticism from Queenslanders for abandoning terrestrial travel in the past, and it\u2019s unclear how the decommissioned ScoMo Express would have fared in rising floodwaters. Add to that just how difficult it is to pull off camo green (just ask Melania Trump) and his apparently singular knack for fashion faux pas \u2013 the shoes, the hats, the jersey \u2013 and you have yourself an easy target for ridicule. And it\u2019s not like the PM is alone among politicians in wanting to put his contemporary spin on John Galliano\u2019s spring 08 collection. In 2017, the Kremlin caused a stir when it released a series of images of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, fishing, diving and sun-baking in fashionably worn camouflage to help cultivate his virile man-of-action image. Closer to home, the One Nation senator Pauline Hanson outed herself as a fan of a heavier duty military look during a visit to Afghanistan last year, while the defence minister, Christopher Pyne, loves nothing more than donning a uniform.

McInnes filed a federal suit in Alabama on Monday over the SPLC\u2019s designation of the Proud Boys as a hate group. McInnes founded the self-confessed \u201cwestern chauvinist\u201d group, and promoted them from his media platforms, before publicly quitting the group late last year in the wake of prosecutions arising from a brawl in New York City, and revelations about the FBI\u2019s advice on the group to local law enforcement agencies.

He has described the Proud Boys as a gang. Despite his departure from the Proud Boys, McInnes subsequently lost the broadcasting slot he had enjoyed on CRTV, founded by the conservative media host Mark Levin, after its merger with Glenn Beck\u2019s the Blaze. This followed McInnes\u2019s and the Proud Boys\u2019s removal from major social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, a PayPal ban and the Australian government\u2019s decision to refuse McInnes a visa to enter the country. McInnes\u2019s complaint against the SPLC \u2013 posted online by his lawyer G Baron Coleman \u2013 says that that McInnes was \u201csuccessfully targeted for personal and professional destruction by a self-appointed enforcer of [political] orthodoxy\u201d. Later, the complaint alleges that the SPLC is responsible for \u201cthe termination of Mr. McInnes\u2019s employment, an almost complete deplatforming and defunding and subjecting him to employment discrimination based on his lawful non-employment recreational activities\u201d. In a statement Monday, the SPLC president, Richard Cohen, said: \u201cTo paraphrase FDR, judge us by the enemies we\u2019ve made\u201d, continuing: \u201cThe fact that he\u2019s upset with SPLC tells us that we\u2019re doing our job exposing hate and extremism. His case is meritless.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time McInnes has criticized the SPLC. Last June, he told the Guardian at a New York City rally supporting Tommy Robinson, the far-right founder of the English Defence League, that the SPLC was a \u201cpernicious group that preys on old Jewish people \u2026 (with) cultural PTSD because of what happened in world war II\u201d. McInnes is not alone among far-right figures in pursuing legal action against an organization that has fiercely criticized him. Like him, many allege that the SPLC destroys conservatives in order to raise funds from liberal backers. In January, the anti-immigration group the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) filed a suit that named the SPLC director, Heidi Beirich, and Cohen. CIS \u2013 whose reports and research are widely quoted in conservative and far-right media \u2013 filed a racketeering claim against Beirich and Cohen, alleging that a string of articles on CIS on the SPLC\u2019s Hatewatch blog constitute a conspiracy to brand it as a hate group, and to raise money off of this accusation. And last September, the lawyer Glen Allen filed suit against the SPLC, Beirich, the former employee Mark Potok and others claiming that the SPLC is \u201cmotivated by lucrative fundraising aims \u2026 to destroy, through public shaming \u2026 groups and persons the SPLC broadly defines as its political enemies\u201d. The suit rejected as \u201cfarcical\u201d the SPLC\u2019s \u201cassertion that Allen is a \u2018well known\u2019 \u2018Neo-Nazi Lawyer\u2019.\u201d Allen\u2019s fundraising efforts for the suit have been heavily promoted on white nationalist and far-right websites. But the threats to SPLC are not coming solely from the right. The group also withdrew three articles by the anti-fascist researcher and author Alexander Reid Ross last year after a legal letter from the journalist Max Blumenthal. He was responding to an article Ross wrote about Blumenthal\u2019s appearances on Russian media and at a Moscow gala in 2015. The suits come after Maajid Nawaz, the founder of the London thinktank Quilliam, who in June 2018 extracted $3.375m and an apology from the SPLC in a suit over their designation of Nawaz as an anti-Muslim extremist. The claims come as conservative figures attack the SPLC\u2019s credibility in the Trump era. In 2017, 47 high-profile conservatives wrote an open letter in the wake of the Charlottesville murder of Heather Heyer, calling the SPLC \u201can attack dog of the political left \u2026 (which) has realized the profitability of defamation\u201d. The following year, the former attorney general Jeff Sessions launched an attack on the SPLC \u2013 whose research had previously been used in FBI investigations \u2013 in a speech to the Alliance Defending Freedom. The Fox News host Tucker Carlson has repeatedly attacked the SPLC on his prime time show. McInnes\u2019s suit was reported positively in a range of rightwing media outlets on Monday.",

      "bodyText": "David Bernhardt, a former oil and gas and water lobbyist, will be nominated to run the interior department, Donald Trump tweeted. Bernhardt was deputy secretary and has been running the department since Ryan Zinke stepped down at the end of the year. Environmental groups have accused him of making regulatory decisions on the country\u2019s natural resources to benefit industries, and he has led plans to weaken endangered species protections. He is expected to continue the Trump administration\u2019s priorities to advance oil and gas drilling and mining on or near public land. In a statement, Bernhardt called it a \u201chumbling privilege to be nominated to lead a department whose mission I love, to accomplish the balanced, commonsense vision of our president\u201d. Bernhardt\u2019s reputation as a technocrat working efficiently behind the scenes stands as a 180-degree turn from that of his flamboyant predecessor. Zinke grabbed attention when he rode a horse to his first day at the department. Zinke soon was garnering headlines over allegations involving travel and allegations of possible conflicts of interest. Bernhardt has remained low-profile as Trump weighed him and a half-dozen other reported contenders, chiefly western lawmakers, as successors to Zinke. As acting secretary, Bernhardt drew criticism in recent weeks from environmental groups, tribes and others for continuing to process paperwork for oil and gas projects while other agencies were closed for routine work during this winter\u2019s partial government shutdown. The interior department called its effort important to bolstering US energy independence. \u201cBernhardt got this nomination as a reward for months of work cramming America\u2019s natural heritage into a wood chipper,\u201d said Kieran Suckling, the executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity advocacy group, one of many environmental organizations condemning Trump\u2019s intended nomination. \u201cConfirming him as interior secretary would be a boon to polluters and a colossal disaster for our public lands and endangered species.\u201d The Arizona Democrat Raul Grijalva, chairman of the House natural resources committee, said lawmakers would be watching to see whether Bernhardt\u2019s former industry ties were influencing his policy decisions. \u201cDavid Bernhardt spent much of his career lobbying for fossil fuel and agricultural interests, and the president putting him in charge of regulating his former clients is a perfect example of everything wrong with this administration,\u201d Grijalva said in a statement. Republican lawmakers praised Trump\u2019s pick. \u201cDavid Bernhardt ... brings tremendous leadership with him from our home state of #Colorado and I look forward to a swift confirmation process,\u201d congressman Ken Buck tweeted. Bernhardt, who is from Colorado, first served in interior as a political appointee under George W Bush, becoming the agency\u2019s top lawyer. After his first round at interior, Bernhardt worked at a Washington law and lobbying firm on behalf of mining companies, oil and gas giants, a politically powerful western water agency and other groups that have business before the interior department. Coming back to interior as Zinke\u2019s deputy, Bernhardt recused himself from decisions involving a long list of former industry clients to avoid conflicts of interest under ethics rules. Under leadership of Zinke and Bernhardt, the interior department has pushed to open more Alaskan wilderness and offshore waters to oil and gas development.

      "bodyText": "Nasa scientists have landed for the first time on one of the world\u2019s newest islands, and discovered the three-year-old land mass is now covered in a sticky, mysterious mud, as well as vegetation and bird life. The volcanic island sprang up in the ocean surrounding Tonga three years ago, one of only three new islands to emerge in the last 150 years that have survived more than a few months. Dan Slayback of Nasa\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center was desperate to visit the remote location, because scientists still have scant knowledge about how and why new islands form. A team from Nasa visited in October \u2013 after previously studying the island using only satellite imagery \u2013 and Slayback detailed their findings in a Nasa blog post. The island erupted from the rim of an underwater caldera in early 2015, and remains unnamed, but is sometimes referred to as Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha\u2018apai \u2013 the names of its neighbouring, established islands. Slayback and his team landed on what had looked like a black-sand beach on satellite, but was actually made up of pea-sized gravel that made walking painful. Vegetation was discovered beginning to take root \u2013 with the seeds likely deposited by birds flying overhead \u2013 and a barn owl has begun to make its home on the young island, as well as hundreds of nesting sooty terns. A light-coloured, sticky, clay-like mud continues to \u201cbaffle\u201d Slayback and his team, as to exactly what it is, what it is made of and where it is coming from. \u201cIn the satellite images, you see this light-coloured material,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s mud, this light-coloured clay mud. It\u2019s very sticky. So even though we\u2019d seen it we didn\u2019t really know what it was, and I\u2019m still a little baffled of where it\u2019s coming from. Because it\u2019s not ash.\u201d Rock samples were collected for mineral analysis, and a high-precision GPS unit and aerial drone was deployed to estimate the island\u2019s elevation and more closely survey the uninhabited new land. \u201cIt really surprised me how valuable it was to be there in person for some of this,\u201d Slayback said. \u201cIt just really makes it obvious to you what is going on with the landscape,\u201d A high-resolution 3D map will now be made of the island, and Slayback and his team aim to return next year for further study. Initial estimates suggest the island may survive up to 30 years, before succumbing to the pressures of the ocean.",

Mail Online has published a birth certificate they claim is Abraham-Joseph\u2019s, for \u201cSheyaa bin Abraham\u201d, born 22 October 1992 in Newham hospital in Plaistow, east London. An attorney for Abraham-Joseph, Dina LaPolt, told the website TMZ that lawyers were \u201cworking diligently to get Mr Abraham-Joseph out of detention while we work with authorities to clear up any misunderstanding\u201d. She said: \u201cMr Abraham-Joseph is a role model to the young people in the country, especially in Atlanta, and is actively working in the community leading programs to help underprivileged youths in financial literacy.\u201d 21 Savage has been nominated for two awards at this year\u2019s Grammys, including record of the year for Rockstar with Post Malone \u2013 the track reached No 1 in the US and UK singles charts. In December his second album, I Am &gt; I Was, debuted at No 1 on the US Billboard 200. On Friday he released a video for the album\u2019s lead track, a lot, which mentions border family separation and features J Cole. 21 Savage has also recorded with other US rap stars including Cardi B, Drake and Travis Scott. Ice did not immediately return a request for comment, though an Ice spokesperson told CNN that Abraham-Joseph\u2019s \u201cwhole public persona was false\u201d. The rapper, who helped bring the monotone \u201cmumble rap\u201d style to prominence, said his brother and a friend died from gun violence, and claims he spent time in a juvenile detention centre after being expelled from schools because of gun ownership. \u201cI got caught with a deuce 5 \u2026 and they kicked my ass outta school,\u201d he said in 2015. He frequently describes his life in Atlanta in his tracks, including boasts of criminal behaviour: \u201cI shot a lot of niggas with this East Atlanta \u2018K / I robbed a lot of niggas in North Atlanta for their yay.\u201d But he has also written socially conscious lyrics, protesting against police brutality and social mobility: \u201cTreat us like slaves then they lock us up in cages / Young, black, poor, ain\u2019t had a father since a baby / Why you think we skip school and hang out on the pavement?\u201d he raps on Nothing New. Abraham-Joseph said in 2017, discussing the trap style of rap music: \u201cTrap is some Atlanta shit \u2026 Me, Thug, Future, Migos, 2 Chainz. You gotta be from Atlanta.\u201d In March 2018, he appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to announce an initiative to help young people open back accounts and invest money. Fans have reacted with surprise to the news of his potential deportation \u2013 and an inevitable torrent of memes. Offset, of the rap trio Migos, wrote on Twitter: \u201cAll the memes and shit ain\u2019t funny when somebody going through some \u2026 successful black man they always try some way to bring us down.\u201d The pop singer Demi Lovato became embroiled in arguments online after saying: \u201cSo far 21 savage memes have been my favorite part of the Super Bowl\u201d. She has since deleted her Twitter account.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today, folks. Thanks for reading! With just one more sleep until the State of the Union, Monday was full of State of the Union news. Bernie Sanders announced that for the third year in a row, he will be speaking on social media after the address, and First Lady Melania Trump revealed that she will be bringing a boy named Joshua Trump to the State of the Union because he \u201chas been bullied in school due to his last name\u201d. President Trump\u2019s inaugural committee was subpoenaed by federal prosecutors and ordered to hand over documents about its donors, finances and activities, the New York Times is reporting. Rinat Akhmetshin, a Soviet military officer turned Washington lobbyist who was present at the now-infamous Trump Tower meeting, \u201creceived a series of suspicious payments totaling half a million dollars before and after the encounter\u201d, BuzzFeed is reporting. In more State of the Union news, the Trumps released their list of special guests. And First Lady Melania Trump has invited a very special guest, indeed. President Trump\u2019s inaugural committee was ordered on Monday to hand over documents about its donors, finances and activities, the New York Times is reporting. A lawyer working with the inaugural committee received a subpoena on Monday evening seeking documents related to all of the committee\u2019s donors and event attendees; any benefits handed out, including tickets and photo opportunities with the president; federal disclosure filings; vendors; contracts; and more, one of the people said. Prosecutors also showed interest in whether any foreigners illegally donated to the committee, as well as whether committee staff knew that such donations were illegal, asking for documents laying out legal requirements for donations. Federal law prohibits foreign contributions to federal campaigns, political action committees and inaugural funds. A spokesman for the inaugural committee said it was still reviewing the subpoena and intended to cooperate with the investigation. A spokesman for the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan declined to comment. ABC first reported that a subpoena was in the works. A federal judge has rescheduled Paul Manafort\u2019s sentencing for attempted witness tampering and conspiring against the United States, Reuters is reporting. President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman will be sentenced on March 13 instead of March 5, according to a court document filed on Monday. Judge Amy Berman Jackson, the federal judge presiding over Manafort\u2019s criminal case in Washington, did not provide a reason for the delay. A Russian-born lobbyist who was present at the now-infamous Trump Tower meeting \u201creceived a series of suspicious payments totaling half a million dollars before and after the encounter,\u201d BuzzFeed is reporting. Documents reviewed by BuzzFeed News show that Rinat Akhmetshin, a Soviet military officer turned Washington lobbyist, deposited large, round-number amounts of cash in the months preceding and following the meeting, where a Russian lawyer offered senior Trump campaign officials dirt on Hillary Clinton. The lobbyist also received a large payment that bank investigators deemed suspicious from Denis Katsyv, whose company Prevezon Holdings was accused by the US Justice Department of laundering the proceeds of a $230 million Russian tax fraud. The Trump Tower meeting and those who attended it have become a focus of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s inquiry into whether the president\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. As part of that inquiry, banks were asked to pull financial information on the meeting attendees, and investigators at Wells Fargo handed over documents on Akhmetshin to the US Treasury in 2017. Those records were passed to Mueller\u2019s team, but Peter Carr, a spokesperson for the special counsel, declined to say whether the transactions are under investigation. Congressional investigators also requested the financial information from the Treasury Department. Just last month, Natalya Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer with whom Akhmetshin attended the meeting, was accused by US authorities of secretly coordinating with the Russian government while defending Katsyv in a money laundering case in New York. Stacey Abrams may be delivering the Democratic response to Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union, but Bernie Sanders is taking to social media to deliver his own response as well. The Vermont senator is an independent, but ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination during the 2016 presidential campaign. Hello again, Vivian Ho on the west coast, taking over for Lauren Gambino. Let\u2019s see what else Monday has in store for us, shall we? Virginia\u2019s lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax implies embattled governor Ralph Northam may be behind fresh accusations of sexual misconduct. Speculation is building around what is \u2013 and isn\u2019t \u2013 in Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal plan. Universal healthcare? A federal jobs guarantee? The freshman congresswoman says we\u2019ll find out soon, possibly before the end of the week. New polling shows that an independent, third-party presidential bid would hurt Democrats and possibly help re-elect Trump. Donald trump announced that David Bernhardt, a former oil and gas and water lobbyist, will be nominated to run the interior department. Interesting bit of trivia: Rosa Parks, the civil rights activist who famously refused to give up her seat to a white passenger in protest of the racial segregation of the public transit system, was born on this day in 1913. Justin Fairfax, the lieutenant governor of Virginia who would succeed Ralph Northam and is now facing his own allegation of sexual misconduct, has suggested that Northam is behind what he has called \u201ca smear\u201d. \u201cDoes anybody think it\u2019s any coincidence that on the eve of potentially my being elevated that that\u2019s when this uncorroborated smear comes out?\u201d Fairfax told reporters at the Virginia state capitol when asked whether he believes Northam, a fellow Democrat, was behind the accusation coming to light, according to the New York Times. He offered no evidence tying the Northam camp to the allegation. Fairfax has said the encounter was consensual. If you\u2019re Northam weighing your options, this is not good news: Politico reports that the pro-impeachment group run by Tom Steyer to pressure the Democratic chairman of the House ways and means committee to subpoena Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns. \u201cTom Steyer\u2019s Need to Impeach campaign is spending $109,000 on a two-week ad buy in the relatively small media market of Springfield, Mass., to pressure [congressman Richard] Neal into action, and plans to hire paid staff and launch a door-to-door canvassing effort in the congressman\u2019s district.\u201d Senator Ed Markey, a Democrat from Maryland, who is working with freshman congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to unveil Green New Deal legislation, announced that his guest for the State of the Union will be Varshini Prakash, the executive director and co-founder of the Sunrise Movement. The group rose to prominence after staging a protest in the soon-to-be elected House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s congressional office. Ocasio-Cortez joined the demonstration and called on Congress to back the Green New Deal concept and revive a special committee on climate change. The choice is AOC-approved. Read more about the deal from our environmental reporter, Emily Holden. David Bernhardt, a former oil and gas and water lobbyist, will be nominated to run the interior department, Donald Trump tweeted. Bernhardt was deputy secretary and has been running the department since Ryan Zinke stepped down at the end of the year Bernhardt has led plans to weaken endangered species protections. He is expected to continue the Trump administration\u2019s priorities to advance oil and gas drilling and mining on or near public land. Time magazine reports that Donald Trump didn\u2019t know that Nepal and Bhutan were independent countries. The reporting comes in a story about how Trump has repeatedly ignored or tried to contradict intelligence briefings. In another briefing on South Asia, Trump\u2019s advisors brought a map of the region from Afghanistan to Bangladesh, according to intelligence officers with knowledge of the meeting and congressional officials who were briefed on it. Trump, they said, pointed at the map and said he knew that Nepal was part of India, only to be told that it is an independent nation. When said he was familiar with Bhutan and knew it, too, was part of India, his briefers told him that Bhutan was an independent kingdom. Last August, Politico reported on president\u2019s mispronunciation of the names of the two countries during the same briefing. Unsurprisingly, Ralph Northam\u2019s approval rating has collapsed since he admitted to wearing blackface at a Michael Jackson dance party while still denying he was in the picture on his yearbook page featuring a man in blackface and another in a KKK hood. In a new poll by Morning Consult, the Virginia governor\u2019s approval rating has cratered. He\u2019s gone from 48% approval to 29% approval while his disapproval rating has soared and gone from 26% to 48%. New polling shows that a majority of Americans still oppose new wall construction on the southern border with Mexico. New data from Gallup says that 60% of Americans oppose expanding wall construction while 40% support it. This is only a minor change from from polling done last year, which showed 57% of Americans opposed this and 41% supported it. Since then, a month-long government shutdown has been held over wall funding. A new poll of Iowa caucusgoers from Emerson College shows Joe Biden with a healthy lead if he chooses to run. The former vice president would take 29% of caucusgoers, followed by California Senator Kamala Harris at 18%, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders at 15% and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren at 11%. The poll comes just less than a year before the Iowa Caucuses are held on 3 February 2020. New polling from Politico and Morning Consult shows that a potential third party presidential bid by billionaire Howard Schultz would hurt Democrats far more than Republicans. The Starbucks mogul has come under heavy criticism from Democrats as he as explored a potential bid in the past week as a centrist advocating fiscally conservative and socially liberal policies. Schultz though has emphasized his opposition to progressives inside the Democratic party. While only 26% of voters who approve of Trump\u2019s job performance as president said they were very or somewhat likely to consider a third-party candidate, a larger percentage of Trump disapprovers, 41%, said they would consider voting for an independent. By party, nearly a third of Democrats, 31%, say they would consider a third-party candidate, compared with 25% of Republicans who indicated they would consider voting for someone other than the two major-party nominees. But the data don\u2019t suggest Schultz, the billionaire ex-CEO of Starbucks, could do more than play spoiler in the 2020 presidential race. While 35% of all voters in the poll said they would consider a third-party candidate, only 12% said they\u2019d be very likely to look outside the two major parties. And survey data and experts alike dispute Schultz\u2019s rationale for his possible campaign: that a critical mass of unrepresented voters in the political center could be marshaled into an electoral majority by a moderate voice. New Jersey just officially approved an increase in the state minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2024. Democratic governor Phil Murphy signed the bill just now in a major progressive goal for the deep blue state. Past efforts to raise the minimum wage were blocked under former Republican governor Chris Christie. Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign is taking steps to clamp down on a potential primary challenge. Although Trump is a likely shoo-in to win re-nomination, a bruising primary battle could leave him vulnerable in a general election. The last two incumbent presidents to lose re-election, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush both faced strong primary challenges. As the Associated Press reports: Bill Stepien, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, calls it all a \u201cprocess of ensuring that the national convention is a television commercial for the president for an audience of 300 million and not an internal fight.\u201d One early success for Trump\u2019s campaign was in Massachusetts, where Trump backer and former state Rep. Jim Lyons last month defeated the candidate backed by Massachusetts Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, a Trump critic, to serve as the state party chairman. \u201cWe have a constant focus on tracking everything regarding this process,\u201d Stepien said. \u201cWho\u2019s running, what their level of support for the president is and what their vote counts are.\u201d The campaign\u2019s work extends beyond state party leadership races, which are taking place in many key states in the coming weeks. Trump\u2019s team plans to organize at county and state caucuses and conventions over the next 18 months to elevate pro-Trump leaders and potential delegates. Ahead of the convention, it aims to have complete control of the convention agenda, rules and platform \u2013 and to identify any potential trouble-makers well in advance. Politico reports that one key feature of Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address tomorrow will be a pledge to end the Aids epidemic in the United States. Under Trump\u2019s 10-year strategy, health officials would target the US communities with the most HIV infections and work to reduce transmissions by 2030. The strategy has been championed by top health officials, including HHS secretary Alex Azar and CDC director Robert Redfield. While Trump\u2019s plans for the address remain fluid \u2013 and one official cautioned that the speech is not finalized \u2013 HHS has pressed the White House to ensure the HIV strategy is highlighted on Tuesday night, said two individuals. The agency is also planning a broader rollout this week. An HHS spokesperson referred questions to the White House. A White House spokesperson declined to comment. The goal would be ultimately end all new transmissions of HIV by 2030. Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, will make her first appearance testifying before Congress since Democrats took over in March. Nielsen is likely to face tough questioning about a number of controversial Trump administration policies including family separation and the efficacy of a wall on the United States\u2019s southern border. Justin Fairfax, the lieutenant governor of Virginia who would succeed Ralph Northam, is now facing his own allegation of sexual misconduct. Fairfax was forced to respond to the allegation, surfaced on a right-wing blog, overnight. As the New York Times reports, the allegation has added even more uncertainty to a state government in crisis after Northam admitted to appearing in blackface at a party 35 years ago. As Mr. Northam met Monday morning with advisers in the state capitol complex here to discuss his future, stunned legislators arrived to word that of the middle-of-the-night statement by the Fairfax aides after the publication of the story by the right-wing website, Big League Politics. The allegation threw Virginia\u2019s government into a deeper state of chaos, just two days after Mr. Northam admitted that in 1984 he had used shoe polish to darken his face for a Michael Jackson-themed dance party but denied in the same year that he had appeared in blackface or a Ku Klux Klan robe. Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski is hitting the fundraising circuit for the Ohio Republican party. Lewandowski has long been a lightning rod both within Trump\u2019s inner circle and in the general public. He was fired after alienating Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump and drawing unwanted attention when he allegedly assaulted reporter Michelle Fields. Lewandowski has continued as an informal advisor to Trump as well as using his connections to start a lobbying firm where the ex-Trump aide insisted he did not lobby. Axios obtained Donald Trump\u2019s private schedules on Sunday, which show that a majority of his day is left in unstructured \u201cexecutive time\u201d. The unprecedented leak shows Trump\u2019s unique governing style. In contrast to past presidents who had tightly regimented schedules, Trump has much of the day open for freewheeling phone conversations, private meetings and, of course, time watching cable news. Close White House aides to Trump expressed their disappointment in the leak: Dr Ronny Jackson, the former White House physician whose failed nomination to be secretary of Veterans Affairs sparked controversy in 2018, will be promoted. The White House announced Jackson had been elevated to his chief medical advisor with the rank assistant to the president. Jackson, an admiral in the United States Navy, was also nominated to be elevated a run to be a two star admiral. Jackson\u2019s nomination foundered over questions about his conduct as White House physician, which included allegations of drinking on the job, as well as administrative experience to manage the VA\u2019s bureaucracy. Cory Booker\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign has unveiled a long list of hires in the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. The hires include a number of top operatives in each state who all have number of cycles of experience. It includes veterans of all three major Democratic presidential campaigns of 2016: Clinton, Sanders and O\u2019Malley The Republican speaker of the Virginia House, Kirk Cox, has no plans to force Ralph Northam from office. Cox told reporters this morning \u201cI think there\u2019s a rightful hesitation about removal from office, because obviously you have to consider that to some degree you\u2019re overturning an election. As the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports: Cox noted that General Assembly Republicans were among the \u201clast\u201d people to call for Northam to resign. The speaker said he continues to believe Northam has lost the ability to govern \u201cregardless of the veracity of the photograph.\u201d Cox said he\u2019s not convinced the yearbook scandal meets the constitutional threshold for impeachment proceedings. Northam has faced near-universal calls to resign after it emerged that a racist picture had been on his medical school yearbook page. A second top Democratic candidate has thrown his hat into the ring to challenge incumbent Colorado Republican senator Cory Gardner in 2020. Andrew Romanoff, a former speaker of the State House, who mounted an unsuccessful campaigns for U.S. Senate in 2010 and for Congress in 2014, is poised to announce a campaign. Gardner is one of the most vulnerable Republicans up for re-election in 2020. The first-term senator is one of two incumbent senators on the ballot in a state that Hillary Clinton won. The other is Susan Collins of Maine. Former vice-president Joe Biden is still on the fence about a presidential bid, telling people \u201cI\u2019m 70 percent there, but I\u2019m not all the way there.\u201d The Atlantic reports Biden is taking many of the steps necessary to mount a campaign but is still hesitating about a run. Top positions for a campaign have been sketched out. Donor outreach has accelerated, with Biden himself telling staff at some events to write down the names of people who say they\u2019re eager to help. A list of potential \u201cday-one endorsers\u201d among elected officials has been prepared. Basic staff outreach is happening. Biden has even joked to people that he\u2019s upped his daily workout to get in shape. \u201cI have been told that if it happens, I need to be ready to go with a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d said one person who\u2019s been in conversations with Biden\u2019s top aides. Skepticism persists, fed by donors who are wondering why they haven\u2019t heard anything, and operatives who others in the field assumed Biden would have locked down by now are still shopping around for other candidates. Biden, who mounted failed presidential campaigns in 1988 and 2008, almost ran against Hillary Clinton in 2016 but decided not to at the last minute. Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton will publish his first book in May, another step forward for a rising star in the Republican Party. An veteran with undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard, Cotton\u2019s book will chronicle the Old Guard, the oldest active duty regiment in the Army which serves ceremonial functions. Cotton served in the unit for over a year. As Politico reports: The apolitical \u201cSacred Duty: A Soldier\u2019s Tour at Arlington National Cemetery\u201d will showcase Cotton\u2019s service in the military, rather than the hard-edged conservatism that many Republicans believe the first-term Arkansan will eventually try to use to run for president. One of the youngest senators and someone who is close to President Donald Trump, the hawkish 41-year-old Republican is still subject to regular buzz about serving in the Cabinet or eventually running for the president. He\u2019s also up for reelection next year, though his seat is presumably safe in red Arkansas. Cotton received more than $500,000 in advance for the book, according to a source close to him. Good morning, We are one day away from the State of the Union, eleven days away from another potential government shutdown and three days into the political crisis in Virginia sparked the discovery of a racist picture on the yearbook page of the state\u2019s Democratic governor, Ralph Northam. It\u2019s Monday in American politics.",

      "bodyText": "In the 2001 Australian film The Bank, a bank CEO has hold of research suggesting with certainty that a massive stock market crash is about to occur. Rather than publicise the advice he suggests the bank take advantage and make a massive profit out of the crash. When a board member suggests they have a duty to the public to release the information, he replies he only cares about the shareholders \u2013 \u201cThey are our people. They are our \u2018society\u2019. The public can take care of themselves.\u201d The final report of the Hayne royal commission into misconduct in the banking, superannuation and financial services industry shows that this view was not the stuff of fiction. While the final report lacks the blood in the boardrooms many were hoping for, we should not be tricked into thinking this was somehow a good report for the banks, merely because most of the bad news about their behaviour was revealed in the interim report. The report should be a mark of shame for those within the banking sector. Consider Kenneth Hayne notes that \u201cbetween them, AMP, ANZ, CBA, NAB and Westpac will pay customers of their advice licensees or their superannuation funds compensation totalling $850m, or more, for taking money as payment for services that were not provided.\u201d Why did this occur? Why could you have an industry where such an egregious amount of money was charged for doing nothing? The culture. And despite what those who defend capitalism might suggest, the profit motive was at the very root of the problem. Hayne charged that \u201cin almost every case, the conduct in issue was driven not only by the relevant entity\u2019s pursuit of profit but also by individuals\u2019 pursuit of gain ... Providing a service to customers was relegated to second place. Sales became all important.\u201d And everyone got in on the act as the desire for profit saw a system designed to remove people from the equation \u2013 \u201cthose who dealt with customers became sellers. And the confusion of roles extended well beyond front line service staff. Advisers became sellers and sellers became advisers.\u201d Perhaps most damningly was how Hayne really saw little need for new laws. The problem was not the lack of laws, but the lack of care about obeying them, and even less care about the ethics of their business practices. \u201cRewarding misconduct is wrong,\u201d Hayne noted. \u201cYet incentive, bonus and commission schemes throughout the financial services industry have measured sales and profit, but not compliance with the law and proper standards.\u201d It is an industry rife with incentives \u2013 not to act ethically or in the public\u2019s interests but where \u201crewards have been paid, regardless of whether the sale was made, or profit derived, in accordance with law. Rewards have been paid regardless of whether the person rewarded should have done what they did.\u201d Why did they act this way? \u201cBecause\u201d, Hayne noted with bitterness, \u201cthey could.\u201d Here the regulators get an absolute bollocking. \u201cUntil this Commission was established,\u201d Hayne charges, \u201cASIC and the relevant entities\u201d barely gave any reproach for \u201cfees for no service conduct\u201d. At worst the entity was required \u201cto repay what it had taken, together with some compensation for the client not having had the use of the money\u201d \u2013 which was in effect no deterrent at all. Hayne berated the regulators stating that \u201cthe conduct was treated as if it was no more than a series of inadvertent slips brought about by some want of care in record keeping\u201d. $850m is a lot of inadvertent slips. The report also notes the case of IOOF engaging in potentially \u201cmisleading and deceptive conduct\u201d, and yet Hayne notes that \u201cthere is no evidence that this possible contravention of the Asic Act is presently under investigation\u201d. Asleep at the wheel is the most generous way you could put it. While the report does recommend 24 cases of misconduct be referred to the financial regulators for consideration of civil or criminal action, with Westpac being the lone exception among the major banks in not being included in this list, there were some individuals who were singled out for criticism. Among those whose reputation has most taken a hit is the former secretary of the treasurer, now the chair of NAB, Ken Henry. Henry might consider in future that while barely disguised condescension works fine when dealing with partisan and generally dim LNP senators during an estimates hearing, when facing cross-examination from very sharp counsel assisting it\u2019s best to show some respect. Hayne singled out NAB for the sharpest criticism noting that \u201chaving heard from both the CEO, Mr Thorburn, and the chair, Dr Henry, I am not as confident as I would wish to be that the lessons of the past have been learned\u201d. Ouch. He further asserted that \u201cI thought it telling that Dr Henry seemed unwilling to accept any criticism of how the board had dealt with some issues\u201d. The next NAB shareholder meeting should be fun. As for the government, their line is that they are \u201ctaking action\u201d on all of the commissioner\u2019s recommendations. But that does not mean agreeing with them, nor even implementing them in the manner which is recommended. For example, the commissioner recommended that \u201cgrandfathering provisions for conflicted remuneration should be repealed as soon as is reasonably practicable\u201d. This would see an end to payments to advisers and others that could influence their advice to customers on what is the best product for them to purchase. The government has decided that \u201cas soon as is reasonably practicable\u201d is 1 January 2021. That is an absurdly long time, but not surprising given this government reduced the ALP\u2019s laws on conflicted remuneration in its amendments to the Future of Financial Advice Act. The government \u2013 and I suspect the ALP \u2013 will also take time before committing to instituting Hayne\u2019s recommendation that fees for mortgage brokers be paid by borrowers and not lenders. This would likely see the brokering sector shrink \u2013 and could reduce competition for mortgages. I suspect both sides will instead argue for more transparency on behalf of brokers \u2013 and the belief that a new law for brokers to \u201cact in the best interests of the intending borrower\u201d (which I suspect most people would be surprised to find is not currently the case) will do the job. As it is, the government has agreed to banning trail commissions and other inappropriate forms of lender-paid commissions on new loans from 1 July 2020, but only a further review in three years on the implications of removing upfront commissions and moving to a borrower pays remuneration structure. The other big recommendation that will have a major impact is for all new workers to have one default superannuation fund. This fits with a recent recommendation by the productivity commission. It is, however, one of those recommendations that reads well on paper and is easily agreed to, but which will be fought over bitterly in legislation. And that brings us to the nub of the problem \u2013 with only a likely 10 sitting days before the election, there is nowhere near the time to properly debate and legislate the major issues. For a government that did all it could to avoid holding the commission in the first place, it is appropriate that its own desire to avoid parliamentary scrutiny will mean it is unable to carry out most of the recommendations. The report damns the industry, the regulators and through its findings the words of the government ministers who voted against the commission being held. The report will address many of the issues, but it will only really cause change if the magnifying glass stays on the industry \u2013 which is why Hayne recommends a government review into the industry\u2019s response into the effectiveness of the measures \u2013 in effect giving the banks warning that they\u2019ll be asked to show they have improved. It would be nice if they did, but the report certainly does not give much hope that they would if they felt they could get away with it. At the end of The Bank, David Wenham\u2019s character, who has sought to defraud the bank of millions of money and send it broke, is asked why he did it: \u201cI just hate banks,\u201d he replies. There is nothing in this report that would have people thinking differently, and if we\u2019re honest, not much that is going to change that view \u2013 unless the banks themselves want it changed.",

      "bodyText": "Australian comedian Hannah Gadsby has announced she will be embarking on her first US tour with a brand new standup show named after her dog, Douglas. Douglas will be a highly anticipated follow-up to global sensation Nanette, which premiered in Australia in 2017 and was picked up by Netflix in June 2018, following an 18-month tour. Nanette was widely praised for deconstructing the genre of standup. In it, Gadsby reckoned with the ways self-deprecating humour compounded trauma inflicted upon her, and encouraged the audience to confront the realities of marginalisation and their complicity in it. The show launched a thousand thinkpieces, with the New York Times calling it \u201ccomedy-destroying, soul-affirming\u201d and the Atlantic praising it as a \u201cradical, transformative work\u201d. Roxane Gay, Ellen Page and Lily Allen all publicly praised it, and Gadsby landed a publishing deal for a memoir, Ten Steps to Nanette, which is due out later this year. Douglas, which is Gadsby\u2019s 11th standup show, will feature new material that in part deals with the success of her last. \u201cHow does one who is well-practised in the art of negative attention deal with a sudden influx of positive attention?\u201d she said in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter. \u201c[Douglas] is [based] around my inability to wrangle positive attention.\u201d Gadsby made headlines again in December when she criticised so-called \u201cgood men\u201d during her speech at the Women in Entertainment gala: \u201cThe last thing I need right now, in this moment in history, is having to listen to men monologue about misogyny, and how other men should just stop being creepy,\u201d she said. On Monday Gadsby told the Hollywood Reporter that while Douglas will tackle big and topical issues, \u201cthe humour will be back in\u201d this time. \u201cNanette was the only way that people [in the US] know me and so that\u2019s the only prism that they view my work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much [a view that], I\u2019m a comedian that\u2019s not funny \u2026 I don\u2019t have any intention of workshopping any of my traumas on stage again. That took a toll. And also, I kinda did that.\u201d Gadsby said she\u2019s currently whittling down \u201cfour hours of show\u201d, but hinted it will be \u201cinterested in the dynamics of power and privilege\u201d. She also explained why she changed her mind about quitting comedy \u2013 an intention that was at the heart of Nanette, which she has since pulled back from. \u201cI feel like I had every opportunity thrown at me at once [after Nanette]. Everyone wanted a piece of this pie, so to speak,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I thought after some time that perhaps my best next move would be to do something that is what I\u2019m really good \u2026 instead of trying to learn a whole new skill set. \u201cMy whole life and world has changed, so there\u2019s no real reason to change absolutely everything.\u201d New material for the show is being aired as part of a \u201cwork in progress\u201d residency through February and March in Los Angeles, before the show makes its premiere in Melbourne on 27 March and then tours the US. Gadsby, who has been open about the toll that 18 months of touring Nanette took on her, said she is being more cautious with live dates this time around. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be careful because I really exhausted myself with Nanette and touring is a gruelling thing,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll see how the market responds.\u201d",

Mo Salah was a ghost in the first half, taking no shots, attempting no dribbles, making no tackles or interceptions. He can probably be allowed the odd off day.

The sense of injustice was soothed almost instantly as Michail Antonio ran away from the wall at a free-kick and spanked the ball hard and low into the corner. Ke\u00efta had simply watched him go. It an embarrassing goal to concede, the kind of move the Under-13 B team might come up with in training, then decide against using as, well, it is a bit obvious. On the touchline Manuel Pellegrini barely flinched, features betraying just a glint of some ancient weathered joy. And as the second half wore on West Ham continued to pull that defence out of shape in between the Liverpool attacks, to press at the tender points that have opened only as the season enters its final straight. Liverpool\u2019s attack was poor, too. Mo Salah was a ghost in the first half, taking no shots, attempting no dribbles, making no tackles or interceptions. He can probably be allowed the odd off day. In addition Declan Rice was exceptional in his screening role, making eight tackles in the game and gliding around with an easy grace, a great pulsing brain in front of that West Ham defence. Even at the end it was the home team who looked more potent, with Andy Carroll creaking around the edge of the action like a dying iron giant. Liverpool have a two-week break after Bournemouth on Saturday, a game they will be desperate to escape with just the minimum of flak-damage. How successfully Klopp can stitch and mend and reset that depleted defence before the trip to Old Trafford might just decide where their season heads from here.",
