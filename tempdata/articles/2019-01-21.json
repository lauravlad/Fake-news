      "body": "<p>There is, of course, an unending, unyielding pathos to the stories told by the unendingly, unyieldingly bereaved people in a programme about death. All the more so when that bereavement has been occasioned by a means as brutal as murder.</p> <p>This gathering of such awful tales, in A Year of British Murder, was no exception. The perfect evocation of the happy ordinariness of life, remembered by Shaun Woodburn\u2019s best friend after Shaun was beaten to death outside a pub, broke your heart. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do amazing things,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best time was literally sitting in my mum\u2019s house. Being together was the main thing.\u201d The five-year-old asking a friend who stepped where her 17-year-old brother\u2019s ashes had just been scattered: \u201cWhy you stepping on Kyle?\u201d made you glad their mother had felt unable to attend the ceremony for her boy.</p> <p>\u201cI got a last kiss off my Lisa, my lovely girl,\u201d said the mother of a woman killed by her boyfriend one ordinary night, as she smoothed the lipstick-blotted tissue she found when clearing out her daughter\u2019s home. Subtitles ran beneath the Romanian mother of Razban Sirvu as she spoke about her murdered son \u2013 \u201cI miss him very much. As my only child, he will always be part of me\u201d \u2013 but she had the same fathomless grief in her eyes as Shaun and Kyle and Lisa\u2019s parents, and hardly needed translating.</p> <p>You have to serve such stories well, and A Year of British Murder faltered. You can see the superficial attraction of the conceit: to move through a year \u2013 2017, in which there were 768 victims of murder or manslaughter \u2013 giving voice to the people behind the statistics, is an obvious way to structure such a piece. But in practice, it had unforeseen disadvantages.</p> <p>There was something coldly mechanical about using people to illustrate the numbers. Here was The One Who Represents the 105 Victims of Terrorism There Have Been Since 2000; here was The One Who Represents the 38% of Victims Who Are Murdered With a Knife or Sharp Implement. Next up \u2013 One of the 17% For Whose Murder There Is No Known Motive.</p> <p>The demands of chronology and mere representation meant that there was sometimes strikingly little time or weight given to certain stories. Notably so in the case of Tina Billingham, killed after years of abuse by her partner, Ron, leaving her two sons still clearly struggling with the cumulative weight of all that had gone on. </p> <p>Aisha Harris got a few scant minutes to limn the life of her son Ruben, shaken to death aged six months by his father (\u201cChildren under one have the highest rate of homicide in Britain\u201d ran the badly-worded caption, so we were clear which category we were ticking off now), or her own since. She did note how she tried to pretend it was just social services that had taken him away.</p> <p>In the end, and because this approach meant that each story only covered the initial stages of each suffering family\u2019s or friends\u2019 grief, you had the impression of a murder collage rather than any cohesive picture of cause or effect beyond that which any marginally sentient person can be assumed to understand and appreciate already.</p> <p>And so you have to ask \u2013 and I think you must ask, when you are asking vulnerable people to participate in such a programme and share their loss \u2013 what is the point? It wasn\u2019t an exploration of grief or how its evolution is affected by the circumstances of the loved one\u2019s death, and by swift and effective punishment (or not) of the killer. It wasn\u2019t an investigation into murderers\u2019 motives or mindsets.</p> <p>It performed, at best, two functions. The lesser one was as confirmation of what we \u2013 surely to God, though he has as surely forsaken us long ago \u2013 already knew; that murder is appalling, the psychic wound depthless and the breach of natural and every other kind of justice all but unendurable. The greater one was as a testimony to the bravery of the people who do endure, who fight \u2013 such as Shaun\u2019s father and others \u2013 for such scraps of justice as remain to be won and who simply manage to go on, somehow, in a state of unimaginable pain.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough, but perhaps \u2013 especially if taken in the round with other shows on the subject that opt for other approaches and do drill down \u2013 I\u2019m wrong. Maybe it brought some tiny measure of peace to all who took part, either way.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is, of course, an unending, unyielding pathos to the stories told by the unendingly, unyieldingly bereaved people in a programme about death. All the more so when that bereavement has been occasioned by a means as brutal as murder. This gathering of such awful tales, in A Year of British Murder, was no exception. The perfect evocation of the happy ordinariness of life, remembered by Shaun Woodburn\u2019s best friend after Shaun was beaten to death outside a pub, broke your heart. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do amazing things,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best time was literally sitting in my mum\u2019s house. Being together was the main thing.\u201d The five-year-old asking a friend who stepped where her 17-year-old brother\u2019s ashes had just been scattered: \u201cWhy you stepping on Kyle?\u201d made you glad their mother had felt unable to attend the ceremony for her boy. \u201cI got a last kiss off my Lisa, my lovely girl,\u201d said the mother of a woman killed by her boyfriend one ordinary night, as she smoothed the lipstick-blotted tissue she found when clearing out her daughter\u2019s home. Subtitles ran beneath the Romanian mother of Razban Sirvu as she spoke about her murdered son \u2013 \u201cI miss him very much. As my only child, he will always be part of me\u201d \u2013 but she had the same fathomless grief in her eyes as Shaun and Kyle and Lisa\u2019s parents, and hardly needed translating. You have to serve such stories well, and A Year of British Murder faltered. You can see the superficial attraction of the conceit: to move through a year \u2013 2017, in which there were 768 victims of murder or manslaughter \u2013 giving voice to the people behind the statistics, is an obvious way to structure such a piece. But in practice, it had unforeseen disadvantages. There was something coldly mechanical about using people to illustrate the numbers. Here was The One Who Represents the 105 Victims of Terrorism There Have Been Since 2000; here was The One Who Represents the 38% of Victims Who Are Murdered With a Knife or Sharp Implement. Next up \u2013 One of the 17% For Whose Murder There Is No Known Motive. The demands of chronology and mere representation meant that there was sometimes strikingly little time or weight given to certain stories. Notably so in the case of Tina Billingham, killed after years of abuse by her partner, Ron, leaving her two sons still clearly struggling with the cumulative weight of all that had gone on. Aisha Harris got a few scant minutes to limn the life of her son Ruben, shaken to death aged six months by his father (\u201cChildren under one have the highest rate of homicide in Britain\u201d ran the badly-worded caption, so we were clear which category we were ticking off now), or her own since. She did note how she tried to pretend it was just social services that had taken him away. In the end, and because this approach meant that each story only covered the initial stages of each suffering family\u2019s or friends\u2019 grief, you had the impression of a murder collage rather than any cohesive picture of cause or effect beyond that which any marginally sentient person can be assumed to understand and appreciate already. And so you have to ask \u2013 and I think you must ask, when you are asking vulnerable people to participate in such a programme and share their loss \u2013 what is the point? It wasn\u2019t an exploration of grief or how its evolution is affected by the circumstances of the loved one\u2019s death, and by swift and effective punishment (or not) of the killer. It wasn\u2019t an investigation into murderers\u2019 motives or mindsets. It performed, at best, two functions. The lesser one was as confirmation of what we \u2013 surely to God, though he has as surely forsaken us long ago \u2013 already knew; that murder is appalling, the psychic wound depthless and the breach of natural and every other kind of justice all but unendurable. The greater one was as a testimony to the bravery of the people who do endure, who fight \u2013 such as Shaun\u2019s father and others \u2013 for such scraps of justice as remain to be won and who simply manage to go on, somehow, in a state of unimaginable pain. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough, but perhaps \u2013 especially if taken in the round with other shows on the subject that opt for other approaches and do drill down \u2013 I\u2019m wrong. Maybe it brought some tiny measure of peace to all who took part, either way.",

She said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It was an office with a lot of people and I wish sometimes that they had consulted with me ... I worked behind the scenes to ensure that the department of corrections would allow transitioning inmates to receive the medical attention that they required, that they needed, that they deserved.\u201d </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Harris dodged a direct question about whether she believes trans inmates should have access to gender reassignment surgery, saying, \u201cI believe that we are at a point where we have got to stop vilifying people based on sexual orientation. And we\u2019ve got to understand that when we are talking about ... the transgender community, for too long they\u2019ve been the subject of bias and frankly a lack of understanding about their circumstance and their physical needs.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Asked about Donald Trump and Syria, she said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We cannot conduct our foreign policy through tweets. My concern is that when we make decisions about what we will do in terms of our military presence ... that we do that in a way that will involve consultation with our military leaders.\u201d </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>On voter outreach: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>For all voters, we\u2019ve got to reach out to folks, we\u2019ve got to go where they are, understand who they are, we have to listen as much as we talk. That is certainly what I intend to do as a candidate ... It is my full intention to travel this country, and to sit in living rooms and to listen to families ... The vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>One reporter asked, \u201cYou\u2019re an African American woman, but you\u2019re also Indian American. I\u2019m just curious how do you describe yourself?\u201d</p> \n  <p>She responded, \u201cI describe myself as a proud American.\u201d</p> \n  <p>On the investigations into Trump and Russia: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My highest priority and what I believe should be the highest priority for the United States Congress is that Bob Mueller be able to finish his investigation ... Clearly he is following the facts where they lead him, and there should be no interference with that process, because the American public has a right to know what actually went on.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if she had regrets about her work as a prosecutor, she said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can tell you of cases where I really regret that we were not able to charge somebody that I knew molested a child ... There are cases ... where there were folks who made a decision in my office and had not consulted me and I wish they had. But again I take full responsibility for those decisions. But I will also say that there is a lot about what I did as a prosecutor that I\u2019m proud of, including a recognition that there are fundamental flaws in the criminal justice system ... One of my biggest regrets is that I haven\u2019t had time to do more. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>On the shutdown: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>He\u2019s now holding the American people hostage over a vanity project that he calls a wall while 800,000 people are trying to figure out how they are going to pay their rent, how they\u2019re going to pay their mortgage ...

Official and potential 2020 contenders delivered lofty speeches at events marking Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Meanwhile, Donald Trump made a two-minute visit to the MLK monument in Washington, and the civil rights hero\u2019s son criticized vice-president Mike Pence for invoking his dad in making the case for a border wall. The TSA said that a record-high one in ten of its agents did not show up for work Sunday, as the government shutdown continued through its 30th day. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow with more live coverage. Until then, you can sign up to receive our US morning briefing for a summary of the day\u2019s top stories and must-reads. The Guardian\u2019s Hubert Adjei-Kontoh reports: At a packed Harlem church this afternoon congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sat down with the award-winning writer Ta-Nehisi Coates at an event marking Martin Luther King\u2019s legacy. Ocasio-Cortez rejected Donald Trump\u2019s latest proposal to trade temporary protections for young immigrants for money for a border wall, saying there was no reason to give $5 billion to an \u201cunstable person.\u201d The new Congresswoman also touted her proposal to tax the richest Americans at a 70% marginal rate, an idea that was warmly received at the event at Riverside Church. Asked if she was considering running for president (which would have to wait until 2024, since she\u2019s too young to run in 2020), Ocasio-Cortez said she was not, arguing that the fixation on higher office \u201cprevents people from speaking truth to power.\u201d About those 8,000-plus false and misleading statements from Donald Trump during his presidency: It makes for grueling work for the fact checkers. The Guardian\u2019s Adam Gabbatt reports: Since taking office, the president has lied about everything from immigration figures to the number of burgers he served to the Clemson football team at the White House last week. \u201cIt takes up a lot of our time just because he is constantly talking,\u201d said Glenn Kessler, editor and chief writer of the Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker column. \u201cThe pace in Washington has changed. You could wake up and the president may have already had five or six tweets that cry out for fact checks.\u201d Kessler and the Washington Post responded by creating an ongoing database tracking Trump\u2019s lies. But that comes with its own problems. \u201cIt\u2019s become an all-consuming task. In the month of October he said 1,200 things that were false or misleading. There\u2019s some days where he\u2019s topped more than 100 false or misleading claims.\u201d The Washington Post has tallied Donald Trump\u2019s untruths, and finds that the president made at least 8,158 false or misleading statements in the two years since he took office. That includes 6,000 such statements in his second year alone, according to the paper\u2019s Fact Checker. That adds up to nearly 5.9 false or misleading claims a day in year one, which went up to 16.5 a year in year two. Martin Luther King III criticized the vice-president for invoking his father\u2019s memory in making the push for a wall along the US-Mexico border. \u201cThe hearts and minds of the American people today are thinking a lot about it being the weekend we remember the life and work of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,\u201d Pence said Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cOne of my favorite quotes from Dr. King was \u2018now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.\u2019 You think of how he changed America,\u201d he said. \u201cHe inspired us to change through the legislative process to become a more perfect union. That\u2019s exactly what President Trump is calling on the Congress to do: Come to the table in a spirit of good faith. We\u2019ll secure our border, we\u2019ll reopen our government.\u201d King\u2019s son rejected the comparison while speaking at a National Action Network MLK Day breakfast, CNN reported. \u201cMartin Luther King Jr. was a bridge builder, not a wall builder,\u201d he said. \u201cMartin Luther King Jr. would say love not hate would make America great. Did you all hear that? Love not hate would make America great.\u201d Donald Trump did not speak to Michael Cohen before Cohen false testimony to Congress about a Trump Tower project in Moscow, Rudy Giuliani said Monday - the latest reversal from the president\u2019s lawyer. \u201cThe President never spoke with Cohen about the congressional testimony,\u201d Giuliani told the New York Daily News. On Sunday, Giuliani told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that he wasn\u2019t sure whether Trump talked to Cohen about his testimony. \u201cSo what if he talked to him about it?\u201d he said. The Guardian\u2019s Max Benwell reports: In a conversation with writer Ta-Nehisi Coates at Harlem\u2019s Riverside Church, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez discussed her tendency to shoot down critics on social media. \u201cWhoever is coming at me in my mentions with a blue check when I haven\u2019t eaten in three hours ... Until more people start pitching in and holding people to account, I\u2019m just going to let them have it,\u201d she said. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders has drawn some backlash for a tweet saying that Martin Luther King Jr \u201cgave his life to right the wrong of racial inequality.\u201d Writer Ta-Nehisi Coates is interviewing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day event at Manhattan\u2019s Riverside Church. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, speaking at the National Action Network MLK Day event, called Donald Trump the \u201cgrand wizard of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,\u201d a reference to the Ku Klux Klan. Gizmodo finds some evidence that Donald Trump\u2019s team has been posting altered photos to his Facebook and Instagram accounts to make him look thinner and his fingers longer. Senator Kamala Harris entered the crowded Democratic 2020 race for US president with a tribute to a woman who broke barriers in American politics decades earlier. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levin reports: The California senator\u2019s logo is a nod to Shirley Chisholm, the first woman and African American to seek the nomination for president in a major political party, in 1972. Harris, the former attorney general of California, has chosen a red and yellow design for her logo that resembles the campaign buttons used five decades ago by Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress. Harris, the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, has broken barriers throughout her meteoric rise in California politics. The Democrat was the first African American and first woman to be elected San Francisco district attorney in 2003 and state attorney general in 2010. In 2016, she became the second black woman and first south-Asian woman elected to the Senate. There\u2019s been a spate of recent recognition for Chisholm\u2019s ground breaking career, including plans for a Brooklyn statue in her honor. Senator Kamala Harris has just finished her first press conference as a 2020 candidate for president. Here are some highlights from the Howard University event. The first question was about her role as California attorney general defending the prison system\u2019s policies denying reassignment surgery to transgender inmates. She said: It was an office with a lot of people and I wish sometimes that they had consulted with me ... I worked behind the scenes to ensure that the department of corrections would allow transitioning inmates to receive the medical attention that they required, that they needed, that they deserved.\u201d Harris dodged a direct question about whether she believes trans inmates should have access to gender reassignment surgery, saying, \u201cI believe that we are at a point where we have got to stop vilifying people based on sexual orientation. And we\u2019ve got to understand that when we are talking about ... the transgender community, for too long they\u2019ve been the subject of bias and frankly a lack of understanding about their circumstance and their physical needs.\u201d Asked about Donald Trump and Syria, she said: We cannot conduct our foreign policy through tweets. My concern is that when we make decisions about what we will do in terms of our military presence ... that we do that in a way that will involve consultation with our military leaders.\u201d On voter outreach: For all voters, we\u2019ve got to reach out to folks, we\u2019ve got to go where they are, understand who they are, we have to listen as much as we talk. That is certainly what I intend to do as a candidate ... It is my full intention to travel this country, and to sit in living rooms and to listen to families ... The vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. One reporter asked, \u201cYou\u2019re an African American woman, but you\u2019re also Indian American. I\u2019m just curious how do you describe yourself?\u201d She responded, \u201cI describe myself as a proud American.\u201d On the investigations into Trump and Russia: My highest priority and what I believe should be the highest priority for the United States Congress is that Bob Mueller be able to finish his investigation ... Clearly he is following the facts where they lead him, and there should be no interference with that process, because the American public has a right to know what actually went on. Asked if she had regrets about her work as a prosecutor, she said: I can tell you of cases where I really regret that we were not able to charge somebody that I knew molested a child ... There are cases ... where there were folks who made a decision in my office and had not consulted me and I wish they had. But again I take full responsibility for those decisions. But I will also say that there is a lot about what I did as a prosecutor that I\u2019m proud of, including a recognition that there are fundamental flaws in the criminal justice system ... One of my biggest regrets is that I haven\u2019t had time to do more. On the shutdown: He\u2019s now holding the American people hostage over a vanity project that he calls a wall while 800,000 people are trying to figure out how they are going to pay their rent, how they\u2019re going to pay their mortgage ... Those folks don\u2019t want a wall. They want a paycheck.\u201d Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said she feels \u201ccalled to do what\u2019s right\u201d as she kicks off her presidential bid. \u201cOnly what\u2019s right can defeat what is wrong, and I feel very called at this moment to do what is right,\u201d the New York Democrat said at Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration in Harlem. Gillibrand, who announced her run last week, said white people have the responsibility to participate in the fight against racism. \u201cIt cannot be left to people of color alone. It is wrong to ask men and women of color to bear these burdens every single day,\u201d she said. \u201cWhite women like me must bear part of this burden.\u201d \u201cWe have to join you on the battle field of justice for all,\u201d she added. \u201cIt is my fight. It has to be my fight.\u201d Gillibrand said Donald Trump has \u201cchosen to tear this country apart.\u201d \u201cEvery racial line, every religious line - he chooses to divide us, community by community. He has inspired a hate and a darkness in this country that I have never witnessed myself,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is what we are being called to fight against.\u201d Gillibrand quoted the book of Ephesians, saying, \u201cWe have to put on the full armor of God\u201d to fight against injustice. Sharpton quipped it was quite a contrast with Trump, who when asked about his favorite verses in the Bible said the whole thing is incredible. \u201cAnd you have a candidate that can quote the Bible to Bible people. I don\u2019t know whether the president knows where Ephesians is,\u201d he said. Senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren welcomed her fellow Senator Kamala Harris to the race, calling the competition \u201cterrific\u201d for the country. \u201cI like hearing the core issues that we should be debating in this country, and drawing the contrast between the Democrats and Donald Trump. That\u2019s what we do every day,\u201d Warren told reporters after speaking at a Martin Luther King Jr. memorial breakfast at the Boston Convention &amp; Exhibition Center, the Boston Globe reported. Senator Cory Booker declared he is \u201cdissatisfied\u201d and urged the crowd to translate their dissatisfaction into action in a Martin Luther King Jr day speech in South Carolina. \u201cWe are dissatisfied that we live in a nation that finds it easy to take part in dropping million dollar bombs, but can\u2019t take care of veterans right here at home,\u201d the New Jersey Democrat and potential 2020 presidential candidate said. \u201cWe are dissatisfied that we live in a nation that finds all the money it needs for tax breaks and for military expeditions but can\u2019t even pay a public school teacher a living wage.\u201d Booker spoke at the South Carolina NAACP\u2019s MLK day event at the state capitol, where Senator Bernie Sanders also appeared. \u201cThis is not a time for us to rest in our country. The work is not done,\u201d Booker said. \u201cLet us swear the oath that in this nation, there will finally be a day that we are free at last and justice will roll down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream.\u201d The Rev Al Sharpton hit Donald Trump\u2019s brief \u201cdrive-by\u201d visit to the Martin Luther King Jr memorial Monday. Sharpton, at a breakfast earlier Monday in Washington, attacked Trump for failing to have any public events to mark the holiday, calling it an \u201cinsult\u201d. Trump then made an unscheduled two-minute stop at the memorial. \u201cHe went by a drive-by of the King memorial, a 90-second stop, which is the epitome of an insult,\u201d Sharpton said at a second MLK event Monday afternoon at his National Action Network headquarters in New York. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a drive-by, Mr. President. We want government open, and to honor Dr. King you should address the government workers,\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cThis is the most insensitive president we\u2019ve seen in our life time.\u201d \u201cLet me tell you something, Martin Luther King holiday is not a day of talking about going shopping for King Day sales, nor is it a day to go drive by a memorial. It\u2019s a day to deal with justice,\u201d Sharpton went on. \u201cThere could be nothing more offensive to the legacy of Martin Luther King than to have 800,000 federal workers get no pay.\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders in a Martin Luther King Jr day event in South Carolina called Donald Trump a racist who is looking to \u201cdivide us up by the color of our skin, by our gender, by the country we came from, by our religion\u201d. Sanders, a Vermont senator and potential presidential contender, spoke at the NAACP\u2019s King Day at the Dome event outside the South Carolina state house. \u201cIt gives me no pleasure to tell you that we now have a president of the United States who is a racist,\u201d he said. \u201cRacism is here,\u201d he said repeatedly, citing gentrification that has pushed out black tenants and homeowners, black schools that are overcrowded and staffed with less experienced teachers, voter suppression, and the fact that 34% of black children live in poverty. Sanders repeated his calls for Medicare for all, free public college, and universal affordable child care. He noted that when King was killed, he was in Memphis supporting striking sanitation workers. He \u201cunderstood not only that we need to end racism, but that we need economic justice,\u201d Sander said. \u201cKing had a revolutionary spirit. Yes, he was a revolutionary,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are here to fill his revolutionary spirit.\u201d Senator Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat and frequent swing vote, is undecided on Donald Trump\u2019s proposed deal to trade temporary protections for young immigrants for money for a border wall. \u201cHe needs to see the final proposal before he decides,\u201d spokesman Jonathan Kott told Politico. Most Democrats have rejected the proposal which Trump announced on Saturday. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is expected to bring it up for a vote on the Senate floor. Donald Trump mocks House Democrats and encourages his own party to take back the House in 2020 in a tweet today. Donald Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence made a two-minute visit Monday to Washington\u2019s Martin Luther King Jr Memorial. They laid a wreath to honor King, Politico reports. Trump had faced criticism after his public schedule included no events marking the King holiday. Many voters in Michigan who backed Donald Trump are fed up with him over the government shutdown, the Washington Post reports. Trump voters said he had gone too far by forcing a government shutdown because Democrats would not agree to more than $5 billion to pay for a border wall. \u201cIt\u2019s silly. It\u2019s destructive,\u201d Jeff Daudert, 49, told the paper. Some 10% of Transportation Security Administration agents were absent on Sunday, the highest rate since the government shutdown began. The 10% unscheduled absence rate is more than triple the 3.1% rate on the same day a year ago, the agency said in a statement Monday. \u201cMany employees are reporting that they are not able to report to work due to financial limitations,\u201d the TSA said. TSA screeners are among 800,000 federal workers not getting paid during a partial federal government shutdown. The TSA said that 99.9% of passengers waited less than 30 minutes for security, which the TSA considers normal though it is longer than passengers are accustomed to waiting. At Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, the wait time was up to 45 minutes. Republican senators may use the so-called \u201cnuclear option\u201d to push through Donald Trump\u2019s judicial nominees, Sen. Todd Young said Monday. Lower-level judge nominations that lack 60 votes are subject to 30 hours of debate in the Senate, which Democrats have used to slow down approvals, frustrating Republicans. Young, an Indiana Republican, told the Hugh Hewitt radio show that the Senate may move soon to allow debate to be ended with a simple majority. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for a president to advance his or her agenda if you don\u2019t have the right people in place,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just a personnel issue. We want to make sure that the right people, whether they\u2019re judges or mid-level appointees to different agencies are expeditiously processed if they are of a non-controversial nature.\u201d It is already possible to confirm Supreme Court nominees with a 51-vote majority, after the rules were changed to end the filibuster for those confirmations. Senators Cory Booker and Bernie Sanders marched from the Zion Baptist Church to the South Carolina State House with the NAACP and other groups, where they are participating in the \u201cKing Day at the Dome\u201d event, according to the Associated Press. The two politicians, both potential 2020 presidential candidates, looked to be working the room as a team at the church. Senator Jeff Merkley said Monday he asked the FBI to investigate the secretary of Homeland Security for perjury because he is \u201csick and tired of this administration lying to the American people.\u201d Merkley, of Oregon, requested Friday that the FBI investigate whether DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen lied in sworn testimony to Congress about the Trump administration\u2019s policy of separating immigrant children from their parents. He released a 2017 memo from Homeland Security and Justice Department officials in which they listed \u201cseparate family units\u201d as a potential immigration policy, predicting that such a policy would have a deterrent effect on immigrants seeking to cross the border. But Nielsen told Congress in testimony under oath that there was never a policy to separate families. \u201cI am just sick and tired of this administration lying to the American people, lying to Congress, doing it under oath,\u201d Merkley said Monday on CNN\u2019s New Day. \u201cAnd it\u2019s time for some real accountability.\u201d He said the FBI had not responded to his request. \u201cThis is the official, right way to initiate a referral to the FBI for pursuit of an investigation regarding perjury,\u201d he said. Former Vice-President Joe Biden said Monday that Donald Trump\u2019s time as president has taught him that \u201cit doesn\u2019t take much to awaken hate.\u201d Speaking at the National Action Network\u2019s Martin Luther King Jr. Day breakfast, Biden, who is considering a presidential run, seized on a quote from King that could serve as a counter to Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America great again\u201d slogan: \u201cMake America what is ought to be.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve learned in the last two years it doesn\u2019t take much to awaken hate, to bring those folks out from under the rocks, that part of American society that\u2019s always been there, will always be there,\u201d Biden said, addressing King\u2019s son. \u201cFifty years later, the hate that cut your dad down is still nurtured by those forces of darkness.\u201d \u201cThey have been deliberately reawakened again, those forces. It\u2019s not an accident,\u201d Biden said, citing the white supremacist protests in Charlottesville. \u201cWe have to challenge those forces of hate and stand up and simply say what the vast majority of Americans agree to: This is not our America.\u201d Biden went on to call for an end to mandatory prison sentences at the state level, ending cash bail, a $15 minimum wage, and a prohibition on non-compete agreements that stop workers from taking jobs. \u201cFolks, what the hell are we arguing about a $15 minimum wage for? Why is it even a question? No, no, really. Below that rate you\u2019re at the poverty level - people working and busting their necks,\u201d he said. Biden said black Americans have been systematically disadvantaged in criminal justice, education, healthcare and housing. \u201cThere\u2019s systematic racism that most of us whites don\u2019t like to acknowledge even exists,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s something we have to admit - not you, we, white America, has to admit there\u2019s still a systematic racism and it goes almost unnoticed by so many of us.\u201d Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is considering running for president in 2020 as an independent, CNN reports. A source told the network his allies are \u201care exploring a possible independent bid for the presidency in 2020,\u201d and that Schultz \u201cis thinking deeply about his future and how he can best serve the country.\u201d Schultz stepped down from the top job at Starbucks last year and said at the time he would consider running for president, harshly criticizing Donald Trump. \u201cAnyone thinking of running for president as an independent would have to think really hard about splitting the anti-incumbent, anti-Trump vote and just playing the spoiler role and reelecting Trump,\u201d Howard Wolfson, who is advising former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on his potential campaign as a Democrat, told the Washington Post, which reported on Friday that Schultz was considering a bid. The Rev Al Sharpton slammed Donald Trump for not holding an event to honor Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Sharpton called it an \u201cinsult,\u201d the New York Daily News reported. He was speaking at his organization\u2019s MLK Day breakfast in Washington DC, where potential presidential contenders Joe Biden and Mike Bloomberg appeared. \u201cToday as we have this breakfast, there is no official event at the White House to celebrate Martin Luther King Day,\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cThe vice president... nor the President, have any official thing on their calendar to celebrate a federal holiday that Ronald Reagan signed,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is an insult to the American people that the president of the United States does not officially recognize or give any ceremony for Dr King.\u201d Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg spoke at the National Action Network\u2019s MLK day breakfast in Washington, where he was joined by former Vice-President Joe Biden. \u201cWhatever the next year brings for Joe and me, we will keep our eye on the prize \u2013 electing a Democrat in 2020,\u201d he said, according to the LA Times. This would be an unremarkable statement for most potential Democratic presidential candidates, but it\u2019s notable for Bloomberg, who has always said he voted based on the person, not party. Bloomberg did not mention stop and frisk - which Rev. Al Sharpton did bring up during his introduction - according to CNN. But he did say he \u201ccan\u2019t stand up here and tell you every decision I have made as mayor was perfect.\u201d Bloomberg, known for his advocacy of gun control, said King would have been proud of the gun control movement, according to the LA Times. \u201cI have never seen more energy behind the movement than I see right now,\u201d he said. He said there was \u201cno doubt\u201d that if King had lived, he would have made gun violence a key part of his fight, according to NBC News. Bloomberg said King would have been \u201cespecially proud\u201d of the election of Lucy McBath, a new Georgia congresswoman who became a gun control advocate after her son was shot and killed, according to the Atlantic. Bloomberg noted he helped pay for ads for her. Bloomberg also touted his education record as mayor, noting the education budget in New York City doubled during his tenure, according to NBC News. He said that if Dr King saw \u201cthe little progress we\u2019ve made in giving all minority children a sufficient education to succeed over the past four years, he would be shocked\u201d. The Rev Al Sharpton, introducing former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg at his breakfast in Washington, said: \u201cWe disagreed on Stop and Frisk but we agreed on education,\u201d per NYT. Sharpton is referring to stop and frisk practiced by the NYPD, who under Bloomberg as mayor stopped and searched thousands of mostly black and Latino men. Bloomberg staunchly defended the policy as necessary to keep crime down, but crime remained low when the number of stops plummeted under Bloomberg\u2019s successor Bill de Blasio. It\u2019s expected to be one of his major liabilities of Bloomberg runs for president in the Democratic party. Bloomberg was also a big booster of charter schools. It\u2019s a stance he shares with Sharpton and many other prominent Democrats, but many in the party have been moving in the other direction recently. As the US observes Martin Luther King Jr day, potential Democratic candidates are appearing at several events honoring the civil rights hero. Former vice president Joe Biden and former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg are at the National Action Network\u2019s MLK Day Breakfast in Washington, DC. Senators Cory Booker and Bernie Sanders are at the Zion Baptist Church, in Columbia, South Carolina, according to the New York Times. Booker and Sanders are also set to participate in the South Carolina NAACP\u2019s King Day at the Dome event, walking with the group to the South Carolina state house. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand is among those speaking at Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s MLK Day celebration at his National Action Network headquarters in Harlem, where New York Mayor Bill de Blasio will also speak. Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is holding a kickoff event for a \u201cThank You Tour\u201d thanking her supporters. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is considering a run for Senate in Kansas and met Sunday with leading GOP consultant Ward Baker, Politico reports. Kansas Senator Pat Roberts, a Republican, announced that he won\u2019t be running for re-election in 2020. As the Coast Guard Cutter Bertholf departed for a months-long deployment in the Indo-Pacific, Coast Guard commandant Admiral Karl Schultz made nod to the fact that its crew members are not getting paid because of the government shutdown. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard for these crews to be leaving behind their dependants and spouses. It\u2019s a thousand times more so when everyone is wondering when their next paycheck will be, and how they can support the family that they are leaving behind,\u201d vice admiral Linda Fagan, commander of the Coast Guard Pacific area, added in a video. \u201cThe tension and the anxiety for the crew is real.\u201d Senator Kamala Harris, in New York to announce her presidential campaign on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America, celebrated with an egg and cheese sandwich at a shop in Penn Station, according to a photo posted by her communications director. A large majority of freshman Democrats in the House do not yet support impeaching Donald Trump, Axios reports. The news site contacted all 64 new Democrats, and only six said they support impeaching Trump. The largest group, 48 lawmakers, said Congress should wait for special counsel Robert Mueller to complete his investigation before considering impeachment. Senator Kamala Harris will hold her first campaign event Friday in South Carolina, where black voters are a dominant force in the Democratic primary, the New York Times reports - rather than kicking off with trips to Iowa and New Hampshire, which hold the first caucus and primary. She plans to hold a kickoff rally Sunday in Oakland, her home town. Harris was the second black woman to become a US Senator. She is the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father who met in Berkeley, California, at the height of the civil rights movement. California Senator Kamala Harris officially launched her campaign for president this morning. \u201cLet\u2019s do this, together. Let\u2019s claim our future. For ourselves, for our children, and for our country,\u201d Harris said in a campaign video. She joined a field that already includes Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand, and former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, among others.

      "bodyText": "Funding to keep a voracious invasive ant from establishing super colonies in Australia\u2019s wet tropics world heritage area has less than six months of funding left, risking its future, Guardian Australia has been told. The Wet Tropics Management Authority (WTMA), which manages the vast world heritage area in north Queensland, is asking state and federal governments for a $6m a year package for the next seven years \u2013 enough, the authority says, for it to finish the job of eradicating the yellow crazy ant. Yellow crazy ants have long been considered one of the world\u2019s worst invasive species. The ants, which spit formic acid, build super colonies that transform native habitats, overwhelming small species. On Christmas Island, the ants have killed millions of the island\u2019s unique red crabs, transforming areas of the forest floor. The wet tropics are considered the world\u2019s oldest continuing rainforest and a \u201cliving museum\u201d of ancient plants and animals. Scott Buchanan, the authority\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cIf we were to see the sort of degradation that these ants have caused on Christmas Island, then that would have a significant impact not only on the world heritage values of the wet tropics, but also on the tourism industry and the quality of life of all the people who live here. \u201cWe continue to talk to the state and commonwealth, but at this stage while we\u2019ve had positive indications, there has been no commitment. It\u2019s now cutting things fine. \u201cIf we were forced to walk away from this, then we have some preliminary modelling that shows that within 20 years the ants would cover a significant part of this world heritage area.\u201d A 2017 review of the wet tropics by the United Nations world heritage committee said the ants posed \u201ca real and significant threat to the world heritage values of the wet tropics over the longer term\u201d with more effort and funding needed to be effective. The authority\u2019s program started in 2013 with a $2m federal government grant. In 2016, the authority\u2019s ant program got $3.04m from the Queensland government and $7.5m from the federal government. But that money will run out in June and with less than six months to go, the authority is making contingency plans if its funding requests are not met, or funding is delayed. The authority is asking for $6m per year for the next seven years and hopes the Queensland and federal governments will agree to split the cost. \u201cWith that, it would get us to the endgame which is the eradication of these ants in and near the world heritage area,\u201d said Buchanan. Twenty-eight field and support staff work on the program, together with contractors, including a five-strong Aboriginal ranger group helping with survey and treatment work. \u201cThose 28 people are on temporary rolling contracts so even before June, they\u2019re going to need to look elsewhere as things become more uncertain.\u201d He said several of the field staff had come through the federal government\u2019s \u201cgreen army\u201d program and had previously been long-term unemployed. \u201cThey have become very competent field operators. They are able to work in very rough terrain and in quite extreme conditions. We\u2019ve invested in those people and it would be a real shame to lose them.\u201d The program targets the ants with small doses of an insecticide \u2013 fipronil \u2013 mixed with fishmeal, which worker ants collect and feed to a queen, causing a colony to collapse. The infestation of ants occurs in pockets south of Cairns and encroaching into the world heritage area, with another small area in the village of Kuranda to the north. Larger ant areas away from waterways and homes are targeted with helicopter drops, but at other sites the fishmeal is placed by hand. Peter Green of La Trobe University discovered the Christmas Island ants in 1997 and has researched them ever since. He said: \u201cLet\u2019s not find out what these ants could do.\u201d While the impacts of the ants on an area such as the wet tropics were not well studied, \u201cthere\u2019s enough in the scientific literature to say that while we might not know exactly what the impacts are, that this program [to eradicate the ants] should proceed\u201d.

This is a fight that we really don\u2019t want to lose.\u201d In a statement, the Queensland\u2019s environment minister, Leeanne Enoch said the Palaszczuk government recognised the work of the WTMA in eradicating yellow crazy ants. Enoch met with the authority in December 2018 to \u201cdiscuss their schedule of works and associated funding\u201d and look[ed] forward to discussing again \u201cin the near future\u201d. She added: \u201cAny funding allocation will be determined as part of the normal government budget process.\u201d Guardian Australia also has requested comment from federal environment minister Melissa Price.

      "bodyText": "About 2,000 hectares of proposed habitat offsets for the endangered black-throated finch were removed from Adani\u2019s conservation plans last year, mostly on land earmarked for the nearby China Stone coalmine. The Indian mining company also intends to allow cattle to graze on the remaining conservation areas surrounding its Carmichael mine. Leading ecologists have said Adani\u2019s latest version of the black-throated finch species management plan \u2013 which still requires Queensland government approval \u2013 amounts to \u201ca plan to manage a cow paddock\u201d. An analysis of previous versions of Adani\u2019s plan, conducted by the Environmental Defenders Office Queensland, shows a proposed offset section of about 2,000 hectares was carved out in 2018. The EDO says the removal of the conservation area, which contains high-quality finch habitat, points to difficulties Adani might have securing land tenure over the site of the open-cut China Stone mine. Guardian Australia reported in December that most of the remaining 33,000 hectares of offsets is on land proposed for underground longwall mines as part of the Clive Palmer-backed Alpha North project. \u201cAdani has stripped away thousands of hectares of high-quality habitat they had previously planned to set aside for the black-throated finch and effectively surrendered it to a fellow mining company,\u201d said Jo-Anne Bragg, the chief executive and a solicitor at the EDO. \u201cThe carve-out of the [China Stone] area appears to demonstrate the difficulty that Adani is experiencing in legally securing their proposed offset areas.\u201d Adani said in a statement there had been no reduction to conservation areas since 2016, when the federal government approved an offset strategy.

Adani\u2019s own studies, conducted by consultants GHD in in 2014, acknowledged the best finch habitat was where there had been \u201can absence of grazing\u201d. Reside said the finch had been driven to the verge of extinction and that it survived in areas that had been only lightly grazed. \u201cThis plan specifically is really problematic because it reads like a management plan for cows,\u201d Reside says. \u201cThat just blows me away \u2026 we\u2019re trusting this plan to stop this species going extinct.\u201d Adani directed Guardian Australia to a section of its management plan, which says that \u201cstrategically managed grazing\u201d can increase the amount of bare ground on which finches forage. The plan also says grazing regimes can help protect the finch by reducing fuel loads and preventing habitat destruction by bushfires. The controversial Carmichael project cannot proceed until two critical environmental management plans are accepted by the Queensland government. As bureaucrats and experts scrutinise Adani\u2019s proposals \u2013 relating to groundwater and the black-throated finch \u2013 the company has criticised the state government for dragging its feet. Last month Adani unveiled a billboard in central Brisbane and made statements critical of the Queensland government for delaying those approvals. The latest salvo, in News Corp\u2019s Courier-Mail on Monday, implied criticism of the Palaszczuk government for seeking the advice of threatened species experts. The story named several members of the Threatened Species Recovery Hub and described them as \u201cbiased\u201d, \u201cradical\u201d and \u201canti-coal\u201d. The hub said in a statement yesterday it had lodged a complaint with the Press Council and that the story was \u201ctotally incorrect\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m dismayed at this attempt to tarnish the hub and its researchers,\u201d director Brendan Wintle said. Wintle, who is based at the University of Melbourne, said he had been engaged by the Queensland government to lead a panel review \u201cdue to my expertise in the area of threatened species conservation planning\u201d. \u201cThe Threatened Species Recovery Hub is not involved in the Adani review.

      "bodyText": "Look at all that snow in the Alps; has global warming taken a break? Alas, no, it turns out that the recent record-breaking dumps of snow across much of southern Germany, Switzerland and Austria are more likely a consequence of global warming. Why? Balmy temperatures in the North Sea and Baltic Sea are cooking up the ideal conditions to create snow. Right now, average surface water temperatures in the North Sea are about 8C (46F), while the Baltic Sea is hovering at about 3C (37F). It might sound bracing, but as data from the Danish Meteorological Institute shows, these numbers are a good couple of degrees warmer than average for the time of year. And herein lies the problem. \u201cGlobal warming enhances the current snowfall \u2026 Anomalously high sea surface temperatures in the North Sea and Baltic are loading winds from the north with moisture,\u201d tweeted Stefan Rahmstorf of the University of Potsdam last week. Meanwhile, warmer than average air temperatures across northern Europe in early January provided the ideal environment to turn all that moisture into snow. Around the globe oceans are warming far faster than expected. Extra snow and rain is a consequence we are all going to have to get used to.",

      "bodyText": "Labour has said the Commons should be able to vote on whether to hold a second referendum in an amendment the party submitted on Monday night to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit update. It is the first time the party has asked MPs to formally consider a second poll, although the carefully worded compromise amendment did not commit the party\u2019s leadership to backing a referendum if such a vote were to take place. The wording called for May\u2019s government to hold a vote on two options \u2013 its alternative Brexit plan and whether to legislate \u201cto hold a public vote on a deal or a proposition\u201d that is supported by a majority in the Commons. The intervention came as the party\u2019s leadership seeks to deal with divisions between Jeremy Corbyn and some of the leader\u2019s closest allies who are sceptical about a second referendum and those who are more enthusiastic such as Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer. The party\u2019s alternative Brexit plan, which would be the subject of a separate vote if the amendment were carried, proposes that the UK remain in a post-Brexit customs union with the European Union and have a strong relationship with the single market. Citizens\u2019 rights and consumer standards would be harmonised with the EU\u2019s. Corbyn said: \u201cOur amendment will allow MPs to vote on options to end this Brexit deadlock and prevent the chaos of a no-deal. It is time for Labour\u2019s alternative plan to take centre stage, while keeping all options on the table, including the option of a public vote.\u201d But second referendum campaigners were last night gearing up to criticise the alternative Brexit plan. The People\u2019s Vote campaign said that it was one of a series of Brexit promises \u2013 like no-deal \u2013 that were being made with \u201clittle regard for what could actually be delivered\u201d. The cross-party group, supported by dozens of Labour MPs, posed five questions that it believes Corbyn\u2019s Brexit model struggles to answer, escalating tensions between campaigners and the party\u2019s leadership. A 16-page evaluation placed Labour\u2019s plan on a par with both the no-deal option supported by hard Brexit Tories and the Norway-plus customs union alternative, in that they were no better than pledges made by the leave campaign at the time of the EU referendum. \u201cAll three alternative plans,\u201d the analysis added \u201cshare many similarities with the arguments made for Brexit in 2016 when big promises were made with little regard for what could actually be delivered.\u201d It quoted an interview with Corbyn in which he said he would be opposed to any deal that would make the UK poorer, and then cited a report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research that said \u201cevery form of Brexit will damage the UK economy\u201d. The analysis also asked whether the UK would \u201chave any say over its trade policy\u201d under Labour\u2019s policy of remaining in a customs union with some decision-making power over future EU trade agreements. The document, whose authors are not named, said \u201cit is almost inconceivable that the EU would agree\u201d \u2013 citing the EU\u2019s Lisbon treaty \u2013 and that \u201cbeing in a customs union without a say would be very damaging\u201d because the UK would be force to liberalise markets to third countries on a non-reciprocal basis. Tensions within Labour have been rising as MPs who support a second referendum want to pressurise Corbyn into supporting another Brexit vote, in line with the party\u2019s policy to explore it as an option if it cannot secure an early election. A total of 71 Labour MPs declared they supported a second referendum last week on the morning of the day the party lost a vote of no confidence in Theresa May\u2019s government, meaning that an early election was unlikely. The group is planning to take the argument further at a news conference on Tuesday, fronted by Labour MPs David Lammy and Bridget Phillipson with Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson and Caroline Lucas, the Green party only MP. Labour backbencher and second referendum supporter David Lammy said the amendment represented \u201ca big step forward\u201d but added that the party\u2019s alternative Brexit proposal \u201cdeserves to be properly scrutinised\u201d now that Corbyn wanted it to be centre stage. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 January 2019.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May reiterated her opposition to a second Brexit referendum on Monday night, claiming it would threaten Britain\u2019s \u201csocial cohesion\u201d and insisting the centrepiece of her strategy remained negotiating changes to the Irish backstop. With just 67 days to go until Britain is due by law to leave the European Union, May exasperated MPs and business groups by offering scant evidence that she was willing to change course. Giving a statement in the House of Commons, the prime minister outlined three changes she claimed had emerged from discussions with colleagues in the six days since her Brexit deal was rejected by MPs with a crushing margin of 230: \u2022 A more consultative approach to the next phase of negotiations, with MPs, business groups and unions more involved. \u2022 Stronger reassurances on workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards, \u201cwith a guarantee that not only will we not erode protections for workers\u2019 rights and the environment but we will ensure this country leads the way\u201d. \u2022 Another attempt to address the concerns of Tory and Democratic Unionist party MPs about the Irish backstop \u2013 which she could then discuss with Brussels. May dismissed the idea of extending article 50 and stepped up warnings about the potential consequences of asking the public to vote again on Brexit. \u201cThere has not yet been enough recognition of the way that a second referendum could damage social cohesion by undermining faith in our democracy,\u201d she said. Afterwards, May\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cThere is a covenant of trust between the electorate and the government of the day and the PM\u2019s firm belief is that it is the government\u2019s duty to act on clearly expressed wishes of the electorate and, obviously, were that not to happen, that wouldn\u2019t be, and shouldn\u2019t be, without consequence.\u201d May flatly rejected the idea of ruling out a no-deal Brexit, claiming the only way to do so was to accept her deal \u2013 or revoke article 50 altogether. But the prime minister faces a looming revolt over the issue, with cabinet ministers and other Tory frontbenchers likely to step up calls for a free vote on an amendment put forward on Monday night by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper that could pave the way for an extension of article 50 if no agreed deal has been reached. The work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, is understood to have warned May that resignations from the front bench may follow, if the prime minister did not allow ministers to express their backing for the move. Tobias Ellwood, a defence minister, also tweeted his tacit support. \u201cCooked a banana cake yesterday. Told my son it will be ready in 20 mins \u2013 according to the cookbook. It took 30. It was a big decision \u2013 honouring the cookbook or take more time to get the right result,\u201d he wrote. Business groups reacted with alarm to the lack of new thinking in May\u2019s statement, with the CBI director general, Carolyn Fairbairn, calling it \u201canother bleak day for business\u201d. \u201cThe government\u2019s move to consult more widely is welcome, as is the commitment to scrap the settled status charge for EU citizens, but the fundamentals have not changed. Parliament remains in deadlock while the slope to a cliff edge steepens,\u201d she said. May claimed she had met MPs and other parties \u201cin a constructive spirit, without preconditions\u201d, and criticised Jeremy Corbyn for refusing to take part unless she ruled out a no-deal departure. But the Labour leader said her talks had been a \u201cPR sham\u201d and accused her of being in \u201cdeep denial\u201d about the scale of defeat in last week\u2019s meaningful vote. \u201cThe logic of that decisive defeat is that the prime minister must change her red lines because her current deal is undeliverable. So can she be clear and explicit to the house: which of her red lines is she prepared to move on?\u201d Corbyn asked. Labour later tabled its own amendment to May\u2019s Brexit motion, calling for the government to put in place a process for choosing between possible options \u2013 including Corbyn\u2019s own policy \u2013 and a \u201cpublic vote\u201d. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit select committee, tabled his own amendment which would allow indicative votes on four options set out by the committee, May\u2019s deal, no deal, a renegotiation based on a Canada or Norway model, and a second referendum. It was unclear what changes to the backstop May hopes to secure, but the Tory backbencher Andrew Murrison is understood to be in advanced discussions about tabling an amendment time-limiting the backstop, after hearing May tell the Commons that \u201cthe length of the backstop was being actively considered\u201d. Should he decide to table an amendment, it may call for a five-year limit as suggested by the Polish foreign minister earlier on Monday. Murrison had attempted to table an amendment to the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal last week, putting a time-limit on the backstop, but it was not selected by the Speaker. The prime minister also announced on Monday that the controversial fee for EU nationals to register to stay in Britain after Brexit will be waived, after a backlash from citizens\u2019 rights groups and MPs from across the spectrum of Brexit opinion. Under the planned scheme for EU nationals to apply to stay in the UK, which is currently being piloted, those aged over 16 have to pay \u00a365, with a cost of \u00a332.50 for anyone younger. Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, put down a tightly-worded amendment on Monday night to give time for a bill that would give parliament the power to support an extension of article 50. A more radical amendment is planned by the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, which would allow any motion put forward by a minority of 300 MPs from at least five parties \u2013 including 10 Tory MPs \u2013 to be debated in the Commons the following day. It is understood that some MPs present expressed concern that Grieve\u2019s amendment may not attract the support of the Labour frontbench, who are concerned about its major constitutional implications. \u201cWe really need Labour to whip for this for it to have any chance of winning,\u201d one source present said. Second referendum campaigners are expected to focus their efforts on the moves to extend article 50, rather than tabling their own amendment. \u201cA people\u2019s vote will probably not secure a majority in the House of Commons until every Brexit option has been exhausted, but there will be multiple opportunities in parliament to give the public the final say when it has become clear this is the only way forward,\u201d a spokesman said.",

      "bodyText": "Simon Mayo is to launch a national classical music radio station, becoming the latest BBC presenter to depart for a commercial rival as the corporation struggles to keep hold of its top talent. The broadcaster quit Radio 2 at the end of last year after more than three decades with the BBC, following a troubled year sharing his afternoon slot with Jo Whiley in a format that flopped with listeners. At the time, he insisted he would concentrate on writing novels, but he has now been announced as the mid-morning host and face of Scala Radio, a station designed to have a more casual and youthful approach than its established rivals, with a focus on film scores and work by modern composers alongside the likes of Mozart and Holst. The station is owned by Bauer Media, which also runs Absolute Radio and Kiss, and is due to launch on 4 March on DAB radio and online, putting it in direct competition with Global Media\u2019s Classic FM and BBC Radio 3. Mayo said: \u201cThere are hundreds of radio stations playing rock and pop, and only two classical music stations \u2013 until now. Some of it will be familiar, some new and exciting, but all timeless, beautiful and all absolutely relevant to today.\u201d Weekend presenters will include the former Madonna producer William Orbit and the drum\u2019n\u2019bass DJ Goldie, who will provide \u201ca narration of his own journey into classical music\u201d. Mayo\u2019s BBC film reviewing partner Mark Kermode will host a weekend programme based on film soundtracks. Mayo joins a recent exodus of radio talent from the BBC: Radio 4\u2019s Eddie Mair joined LBC and the Radio 2 breakfast show host Chris Evans jumped ship to Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Virgin Radio. The boom in digital radio listening in cars and on smartphones, aided by the growing popularity of smart speakers such as Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google Home, is prompting listeners to try new outlets. This in turn is bringing hefty investment to the UK digital radio market, pushing up presenter salaries and encouraging the launches of new stations. The BBC, which still accounts for almost half of radio listening in the UK, is attempting to adapt to a digital future with its BBC Sounds app and investment in podcasts, but has to deal with the publication of the salaries of its most well-paid stars following an edict from the government. Many leading male presenters were asked to take pay cuts after an outcry over inequality, while others were unsettled by their finances being made public \u2013 enabling deep-pocketed commercial rivals to swoop in and make compelling offers.",

      "body": "<p>It is just over six weeks since Raheem Sterling caused a stir on an otherwise sleepy Sunday morning. Dogs were being walked and churches were being prepared for service when the winger grabbed people\u2019s attention with <em>that</em> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sterling7/p/BrKYvF3gH9e/\" title=\"\">Instagram post</a>. Suddenly, and unexpectedly, we were talking about race.</p> <p>Specifically, we were talking about how we talk about race. Sterling had homed in on the practices of certain sections of the media, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/09/raheem-sterling-newspapers-fuelling-racism-alleged-abuse-chelsea\" title=\"\">claiming they helped \u201cfuel racism\u201d</a>, and from the industry came an acceptance that things had to change. Chins were stroked, think pieces were written. This, we were told, was a turning point. And then everyone simply turned back to what they had previously been doing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/10/raheem-sterling-manchester-city-media-abuse-racism\">Why should someone like Raheem Sterling be seen as \u2018fair game\u2019? | Daniel Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The debate moved on, to things such as spying and who Tottenham may sign to cover Harry Kane while he\u2019s injured, with the Guardian prone to this as much as any publication. Sadly, it\u2019s often the way when it comes to attention on racism in this country. But that\u2019s not to say many of the journalists who came out in support of Sterling do not care, or to overlook the fact change takes time. In that regard it is encouraging to know, as I do, that there\u2019s a broad-ranging group of media figures working slowly but surely behind the scenes right now to improve black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) coverage across all sports.</p> <p>Whether they succeed or not is difficult to call but the will is there to change an environment in which phrases such as \u201ccrystal-encrusted sink\u201d are allowed to enter the national lexicon, causing harm and upset. Some will argue that those responsible should know better, which is true, but what is also required is a considered, proactive stance right across the board.</p> <p>And that\u2019s not just in regards to the type of stuff that leads to a 24\u2011year\u2011old elite footballer feeling compelled to use social media as a political platform. It also relates to misdemeanours that are subtle and largely unintended but, in their own way, also cause damage. Which brings me to Paul Pogba.</p> <p>You may have noticed he has been playing well for Manchester United recently, scoring his fifth goal in five games during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/19/manchester-united-brighton-premier-league-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the 2-1 win against Brighton</a> on Saturday. The upturn has coincided with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s departure from the club, and given the Portuguese was very much <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYPrqubRGXY\" title=\"\">the Dave Clifton to Pogba\u2019s Alan Partridge</a> during their time together at Old Trafford that is no great surprise. The Frenchman\u2019s mood has lifted and improved displays have followed. In turn, that has been discussed and analysed, leading to the use of a particular thread of language.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Pogba is one of the best technicians in the world, yet so much of the discussion around him is based on his athleticism</p> <footer> <cite>Ife Meedolson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Take the column Jamie Redknapp <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6540567/JAMIE-REDKNAPP-Box-office-Paul-Pogba-shows-pace-power-LeBron-James.html\" title=\"\">wrote for the Daily Mail</a> following United\u2019s 4-1 victory against Bournemouth in December, in which he spoke about Pogba\u2019s \u201cpace\u201d and \u201cpower\u201d and how the midfielder \u201cknows he is bigger and stronger than you\u201d in regards to his second goal of the game, a 33rd-minute header. There has been similar from others, including Graeme Souness during his punditry stint for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/13/tottenham-hotspur-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">United\u2019s 1-0 win at Tottenham</a>, when the Scot spoke a lot about Pogba\u2019s hard running and muscularity during a contest in which his most telling contribution had been the pinpoint delivery that set up Marcus Rashford\u2019s goal. It is all well intended \u2013 and, it should be noted, Redknapp and Souness both went on to praise Pogba\u2019s technical traits \u2013 but the dominating aspect of the analysis feeds into narrative that follows black athletes around, namely that their primary attributes are physical rather than creative or intellectual.</p> <p>The same narrative explains why certain black players \u2013 think Patrick Vieira, Yaya Tour\u00e9 and Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 \u2013 are referred to as \u201cbeasts\u201d and why, on a broader level, there are so few black coaches and managers. To stress, much of this is unintentional \u2013 the type of unconscious bias we\u2019re all guilty of \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t be addressed. That\u2019s what the people behind the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/touchlinefracas?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">Touchline Fracas podcast</a> have done by bringing out T-shirts with \u201cPNP\u201d on the front \u2013 \u201cPace and power\u201d; a phrase they and many other black people are tired of hearing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.<br></strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA lot of this comes down to an old-school way of thinking, that black players aren\u2019t capable of being, or to be trusted as, the \u2018orchestrator\u2019 in important positions. It\u2019s repeated so often that it\u2019s become a common belief,\u201d says Touchline Fracas contributor Ife Meedolson. \u201cPogba is a modern-day example of someone who\u2019s been affected by this. He\u2019s one of the best technicians in the world, a brilliant passer, yet so much of the discussion around him is based on his athleticism and, yes, his pace and power.\u201d</p> <p>A change of language requires a change of culture, which means those involved thinking more about what they say and write. In the long term what would undeniably help is greater diversity. Quite simply, the more BAME editors, writers, producers and presenters there are the better the BAME coverage will be. That\u2019s also required in an industry which, to be blunt, has been too white for too long and needs to do a better job of reflecting the society it represents.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/11/raheem-sterling-educate-media-racism-football\">Raheem Sterling shouldn\u2019t have to educate the media about racism | Musa Okwonga</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And anyone doubting something undesirable is going on in regards to how Pogba is covered should consider the fact that, size\u2011wise, he isn\u2019t particularly big for a modern midfielder; 6ft 3in and 84kg, almost identical to Andr\u00e9 Gomes (6ft 2in and 84kg), and yet the coverage around the latter\u2019s generally positive impact at Everton has been less about his <a href=\"https://royalbluemersey.sbnation.com/2019/1/20/18190442/everton-tactical-analysis-andre-gomes-marco-silva-idrissa-gueye-morgan-schneiderlin-beni-baningime\" title=\"\">physicality and more about his craft</a>.</p> <p>All of this is difficult territory but as John Barnes, a consistently exceptional voice on football and race, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/04/racist-abuse-yaya-toure-john-barnes\" title=\"\">says</a>: \u201cWe need to talk openly about perceptions and not be afraid of the fact we have different views about people based on how they look.\u201d</p> <p>That is especially true of the media given the influence those involved hold on public discourse.

      "bodyText": "It is just over six weeks since Raheem Sterling caused a stir on an otherwise sleepy Sunday morning. Dogs were being walked and churches were being prepared for service when the winger grabbed people\u2019s attention with that Instagram post. Suddenly, and unexpectedly, we were talking about race. Specifically, we were talking about how we talk about race. Sterling had homed in on the practices of certain sections of the media, claiming they helped \u201cfuel racism\u201d, and from the industry came an acceptance that things had to change. Chins were stroked, think pieces were written. This, we were told, was a turning point. And then everyone simply turned back to what they had previously been doing. The debate moved on, to things such as spying and who Tottenham may sign to cover Harry Kane while he\u2019s injured, with the Guardian prone to this as much as any publication. Sadly, it\u2019s often the way when it comes to attention on racism in this country. But that\u2019s not to say many of the journalists who came out in support of Sterling do not care, or to overlook the fact change takes time. In that regard it is encouraging to know, as I do, that there\u2019s a broad-ranging group of media figures working slowly but surely behind the scenes right now to improve black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) coverage across all sports. Whether they succeed or not is difficult to call but the will is there to change an environment in which phrases such as \u201ccrystal-encrusted sink\u201d are allowed to enter the national lexicon, causing harm and upset. Some will argue that those responsible should know better, which is true, but what is also required is a considered, proactive stance right across the board. And that\u2019s not just in regards to the type of stuff that leads to a 24\u2011year\u2011old elite footballer feeling compelled to use social media as a political platform. It also relates to misdemeanours that are subtle and largely unintended but, in their own way, also cause damage. Which brings me to Paul Pogba. You may have noticed he has been playing well for Manchester United recently, scoring his fifth goal in five games during the 2-1 win against Brighton on Saturday. The upturn has coincided with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s departure from the club, and given the Portuguese was very much the Dave Clifton to Pogba\u2019s Alan Partridge during their time together at Old Trafford that is no great surprise. The Frenchman\u2019s mood has lifted and improved displays have followed. In turn, that has been discussed and analysed, leading to the use of a particular thread of language. Take the column Jamie Redknapp wrote for the Daily Mail following United\u2019s 4-1 victory against Bournemouth in December, in which he spoke about Pogba\u2019s \u201cpace\u201d and \u201cpower\u201d and how the midfielder \u201cknows he is bigger and stronger than you\u201d in regards to his second goal of the game, a 33rd-minute header. There has been similar from others, including Graeme Souness during his punditry stint for United\u2019s 1-0 win at Tottenham, when the Scot spoke a lot about Pogba\u2019s hard running and muscularity during a contest in which his most telling contribution had been the pinpoint delivery that set up Marcus Rashford\u2019s goal. It is all well intended \u2013 and, it should be noted, Redknapp and Souness both went on to praise Pogba\u2019s technical traits \u2013 but the dominating aspect of the analysis feeds into narrative that follows black athletes around, namely that their primary attributes are physical rather than creative or intellectual. The same narrative explains why certain black players \u2013 think Patrick Vieira, Yaya Tour\u00e9 and Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 \u2013 are referred to as \u201cbeasts\u201d and why, on a broader level, there are so few black coaches and managers. To stress, much of this is unintentional \u2013 the type of unconscious bias we\u2019re all guilty of \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t be addressed. That\u2019s what the people behind the Touchline Fracas podcast have done by bringing out T-shirts with \u201cPNP\u201d on the front \u2013 \u201cPace and power\u201d; a phrase they and many other black people are tired of hearing. \u201cA lot of this comes down to an old-school way of thinking, that black players aren\u2019t capable of being, or to be trusted as, the \u2018orchestrator\u2019 in important positions. It\u2019s repeated so often that it\u2019s become a common belief,\u201d says Touchline Fracas contributor Ife Meedolson. \u201cPogba is a modern-day example of someone who\u2019s been affected by this. He\u2019s one of the best technicians in the world, a brilliant passer, yet so much of the discussion around him is based on his athleticism and, yes, his pace and power.\u201d A change of language requires a change of culture, which means those involved thinking more about what they say and write. In the long term what would undeniably help is greater diversity. Quite simply, the more BAME editors, writers, producers and presenters there are the better the BAME coverage will be. That\u2019s also required in an industry which, to be blunt, has been too white for too long and needs to do a better job of reflecting the society it represents. And anyone doubting something undesirable is going on in regards to how Pogba is covered should consider the fact that, size\u2011wise, he isn\u2019t particularly big for a modern midfielder; 6ft 3in and 84kg, almost identical to Andr\u00e9 Gomes (6ft 2in and 84kg), and yet the coverage around the latter\u2019s generally positive impact at Everton has been less about his physicality and more about his craft. All of this is difficult territory but as John Barnes, a consistently exceptional voice on football and race, says: \u201cWe need to talk openly about perceptions and not be afraid of the fact we have different views about people based on how they look.\u201d That is especially true of the media given the influence those involved hold on public discourse. There needs to be more thought, kindness, fairness and diversity. Otherwise Sterling\u2019s Sunday intervention really will have been for nothing. \u2022 Sachin Nakrani is an editor and writer for Guardian sport",

The the3million campaign group welcomed the move, announced during May\u2019s statement to the House of Commons on her Brexit plan B, but said the task facing the Home Office could be insurmountable. \u201cBecause of the scale of the operation \u2013 registering up to 3.8 million people \u2013 and the time allowed, the Home Office is looking at having to process 5,000 applications a day for the next two years. If they are struggling with smaller numbers now, then EU citizens risk becoming the new Windrush,\u201d said Nicolas Hatton, a co-founder of the group. The Home Office launched a third test phase for the registration scheme on Monday. Last month, a series of bugs were exposed in the scheme\u2019s phone app, including complaints that the passport recognition function did not work on all Android devices. The app does not work on iPhones. Alexandrine Kantor, a French citizen who is an engineer at the Atomic Energy Authority, said she had to try 10 times to get the passport chip scanner to work using her Huawei. \u201cAnd I have one of the latest phones and I am an engineer who is a bit techy. I can\u2019t imagine what it will be like for old people trying to apply. It is not as easy and straightforward as they say,\u201d she said. The Home Office said this latest phase of the scheme was \u201ca test designed to identify bugs before the full rollout\u201d in April. There was a largely positive response to the app on the Google Play store, from where it can be downloaded. \u201cWorked without any problems,\u201d said one commenter. \u201cScanning and near field communication working well,\u201d said another, referring to the technology used to scan the passport.\u201d \u201cIt took me two minutes on my phone from the beginning to the end,\u201d said another. But others reported problems with phone focus, the instructions on the app and a loop. \u201cIt keeps sending the same message,\u201d said one. \u201cTerrible \u2013 Won\u2019t even take picture of passport. Just wasted 30 minutes for nothing,\u201d said another. More than 31,000 people applied for settled status during the two beta tests and more than 27,000 were successful. Around a third of the 2,776 cases awaiting a decision reported that they were unable to use passport verification process on the phone app and had to submit their ID manually. Hatton said: \u201cYou would expect them to have ironed out these technical problems in the beta tests.\u201d The Home Office said it was working with representatives of vulnerable groups, local authorities and experts to make sure less tech-savvy people would be able to register on time. It said it had set up a resolution centre to deal with queries and increased caseworker numbers to 1,500 to help anyone having difficulties with the app. A spokesman said the Home Office was \u201cmonitoring applicant feedback very closely, including reviews on the Google Play store\u201d and it was in talks with Apple about getting the app on iPhones. He added that once the scheme was fully open on 30 March, applicants would be able to post their ID document to the Home Office or visit \u201ca local \u2018chip check\u2019 service run by a local authority or other provider\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Howard Schultz, the founder and former CEO of Starbucks, is exploring an independent bid for the presidency, according to US media reports. Citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter, CNN and the Washington Post said Schultz\u2019s advisers are looking at the possibility of a presidential bid, but that all options remained on the table. According to sources cited by CNN, \u201c[Schultz] is thinking deeply about his future and how he can best serve the country\u201d. The reports have not been independently verified by the Guardian. Schultz first prompted speculation that he would launch a bid for the White House when he stepped down from his position at Starbucks last year. In an interview with the New York Times, he spoke of his interest in public service. \u201cFor some time now, I have been deeply concerned about our country \u2013 the growing division at home and our standing in the world,\u201d he said. While offering fierce criticism of the current president during a CNN interview in June last year, Schultz allowed that \u201cPresident Trump has given license to the fact that someone who is not a politician could potentially run for the presidency\u201d. Indicators of where he might position himself on the political spectrum came in the same interview, in which he appeared to criticize Democratic proposals he considers too left-leaning, among them single-payer healthcare and guaranteed income. With the potential for the biggest field of Democratic candidates in a generation looking to challenge Donald Trump in 2020, the California senator Kamala Harris joined the race on Monday, which was being celebrated as Martin Luther King Jr Day. Schultz is one of three older, white, male billionaires to have contemplated a bid to take on Trump. The others are New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, and hedge fund investor and activist Tom Steyer, who ruled out running for president earlier this month. The trio have an estimated combined wealth: $50bn. Indications that Schultz is at least seriously considering a bid comes as Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Elizabeth Warren have announced their intentions to run for the Democratic nomination, in part a signal that with so many potential Democratic candidates for voters to choose from, the need to lock in support early is considered paramount. If Schultz\u2019s interest solidifies into a challenge, he will be aware that the independent ticket is, at a minimum, an arduous climb; no independent candidate has broken into the double digits in the popular vote at an election since businessman Ross Perot\u2019s 1992 campaign. Disincentives for an independent bid, which have previously dissuaded Bloomberg in two previous election cycles, include fears that an independent candidate would draw support away from the Democratic candidate, thus aiding Trump\u2019s re-election bid in 2020. On Friday, the Washington state Democratic party chair, Tina Podlodowski, issued a statement calling on Schultz to abandon any presidential ambition. \u201cI have two words for Howard Schultz on a potential run for president as an independent: Just. Don\u2019t,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cToo much is at stake to make this about the ambitions of any one person.\u201d Schultz will begin a national book tour to promote a memoir at the end of this month. The book couples Schultz\u2019s journey from the outer-reaches of Brooklyn to multibillionaire coffee-chain titan, while positioning himself as a liberal visionary with the ambition \u201cto reimagine the promise of America\u201d. He is believed to have discussed his presidential ambitions with a circle of former Starbucks advisers and board members, including the former Democratic New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, former defense secretary Robert Gates and retired admiral Mike Mullen.",

Back in October, the Fund forecast 3.7% growth in both 2019 and 2020; before worrying signs of weakness appeared, particularly in the euro area.</p> \n  <p>Warning that \u201cThe global expansion has weakened\u201d, the IMF cited softer momentum in several economies, \u201cincluding in Germany following the introduction of new automobile fuel emission standards and in Italy where concerns about sovereign and financial risks have weighed on domestic demand.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The IMF has slashed its forecast for German growth this year to just 1.3%, from 1.9% expected three months ago. Italy\u2019s projected growth rate in 2019 has also been lowered, from 1% to just 0.6%. </p> \n  <p>The UK is expected to expand by 1.5% this year, up from 1.4% in 2018, and by 1.6% in 2020 (revised up from 1.5% in the last forecasts). But the Fund adds that there is still much uncertainty over the UK\u2019s prospects, given the risk of a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n  <p>Warning that global risks are tilted downwards, the Fund adds: \u201cAn escalation of trade tensions beyond those already incorporated in the forecast remains a key source of risk to the outlook. Financial conditions have already tightened since the fall. A range of triggers beyond escalating trade tensions could spark a further deterioration in risk sentiment with adverse growth implications, especially given the high levels of public and private debt. These potential triggers include a \u201cno-deal\u201d withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and a greater-than-envisaged slowdown in China.\u201d</p> \n  <p>China is expected to grow by 6.2% in 2019 and 2020, down from 6.6% last year. Given these risks, the Fund is calling - again - for an end to protectionist trade policies that hurt the global economy.</p> \n  <p>It says: \u201cThe main shared policy priority is for countries to resolve cooperatively and quickly their trade disagreements and the resulting policy uncertainty, rather than raising harmful barriers further and destabilising an already slowing global economy. \u201c</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-21T13:06:19.089Z\">at 1.06pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c45b72ae4b00173154a851c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-21T12:22:07.058Z\">12.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Brexit bites: over 200 products subject to shrinkflation</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>It\u2019s official: a number of firms have reduced pack sizes of consumer goods after the weak pound pushed up cost of imports following the 2016 Brexit vote.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s not just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/26/brexit-confectioners-shrink-maltesers-sweets\">Mars shrinking its Maltesers, M&amp;Ms and Minstrels</a> chocolate packs by up to 15%, and McVitie\u2019s cutting the number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/26/jaffa-cakes-pack-size-cut-shrinkflation-mcvities-cadbury\">Jaffa Cakes in a packet from 12 to 10</a>. </p> \n  <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/theimpactofshrinkflationoncpihuk/howmanyofourproductsaregettingsmaller\">Office for National Statistics</a>, 206 individual items, from toilet roll to chocolate, were made smaller between September 2015 and June 2017, more than double the number that increased in size.</p> \n  <p>This may be better for your waistline, but not for your wallet. \u201cShrinkflation\u201d refers to the practice of making goods smaller, while selling them at the same price.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"345a577cdc705f0636202e6e53e7373a0f1787fa\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/345a577cdc705f0636202e6e53e7373a0f1787fa/0_395_5957_3576/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jaffa cakes spilling from a tube.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jaffa cakes spilling from a tube.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: studiomode/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Stock Photo</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>You can read the full story here.<br></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/21/brexit-shrinkflation-ons-pack-sizes\">Brexit bites: more than 200 products subject to shrinkflation, says ONS</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c45b1bbe4b00173154a84d2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-21T11:52:14.379Z\">11.52am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Back to China.

      "bodyText": "Q: Can you get your message across at Davos? People at the World Economic Forum have come from across the globe, and some have enormous power, Sir David replies. Some people here have more power than a national state. We need to persuade those people, and get together to solve these problems. The enormity of the problem has only just dawned on quite a lot of people. Attenborough then repeats his warning from his speech earlier - that time is short. Unless we sort ourselves out in the next decade or so we are dooming our children and our grandchildren to an appalling future. Unless people wake up that this is a crisis, we\u2019re lost, he adds. On ocean pollution, Sir David Attenborough says that the amount of plastic dumped into the oceans is \u201cterrifying\u201d. He describes a scene where a seabird chick begs for food from its parent, only to be given a torrent of plastic waste. What we\u2019re doing to the oceans is \u201cdreadful\u201d, he adds. Our economics editor Larry Elliott asks Sir David how we tackle climate change while also pursuing constant economic growth. Attenborough says it\u2019s a problem -- but one that we must wake up to. Growth is going to come to an end, either suddenly or in a controlled way. Anyone who thinks you can have infinite growth in finite circumstances is \u201ceither a madman or an economist.\u201d Attenborough adds. Sir David Attenborough has now swapped the rarified atmosphere of the Crystal Awards ceremony for the less gentrified experience of meeting with journalists at Davos. I guess he\u2019s seen plenty of wildlife in his time, so won\u2019t scare easily. We\u2019re watching scenes from Our Planet - the new environmental series which Attenborough has created in partnership with Netflix. It looks jaw-dropping -- footage of a glacier crashing into the ocean in Greenland, as climate change takes its toll, accompanied by Attenborough\u2019s dulcet, authoritative tones. I suspect it\u2019s going to be a hit. Here\u2019s the climax of Sir David\u2019s message to the so-called global elite at Davos tonight: \u201cIf people can truly understand what is at stake, I believe they will give permission for business and governments to get on with the practical solutions. And as a species, we are expert problem solvers. but we\u2019ve not yet applied ourself to this problem with the focus that it requires We can create a world with clean air and water, unlimited energy, and fish stocks that will sustain us well into the future. But to do that, we need a plan. Over the next 2 years there will be United Nations decisions on climate change, sustainable development, and a new deal for nature. Together these will form our species\u2019 plan for a route through the antropocene [the age of humans]. What we do now, and in the next few years, will profoundly affect the next few thousand years. All the Crystal Award winners spoke powerfully about their causes. Here\u2019s some instant reaction: Attenborough doesn\u2019t have any time of excuses, either, telling Davos that people need to move on from simply blaming each other, or feeling remorse for the state of the world. Practical action must be the focus. Without action on climate, civilization will collapse, David Attenborough tells the World Economic Forum. He\u2019s calling for a new deal for nature, and for humans to use their natural problem-solving skills to tackle the mess we\u2019ve created. Sir David Attenborough now speaks about the changes in communication in his career - his first TV series, decades ago, was only seen by a few million viewers. Today\u2019s technology gives a massively larger reach -- which can help mobilise people to address humans\u2019 impact on the environment before it\u2019s too late. He\u2019s challenging the politicians, business leaders and others at WEF to raise their game, adding that what we do in the next few years will shape the next few thousand years. Up comes Sir David to another warm round of applause. He thanks WEF for the beautiful award, and for the invite to Davos. He then turns to the burning issue of climate change, saying I am quite literally from another age, says Sir David. I was born during the holocene, the period of climatic stability that allowed humans to settle, farm, trade, and made us the globally connected species we are today. Humanity\u2019s impact on the world in Attenborough\u2019s lifetime, though, means that \u201cThe Garden of Eden is no more.\u201d We have changed the world so much that scientists claim we are in a new geological age, the anthropocene, the age of humans. Now it\u2019s Sir David Attenborough\u2019s turn. Hilda Schwab, who is presenting today\u2019s awards, tells delegates that he was recently voted as the most trustworthy person in Britain (cue a fond round of applause) He is truly one of the world\u2019s most beloved figures, Schwab adds. Saudi Arabia\u2019s first female filmmaker, Haifaa Al-Mansour, now collects her award. She explains she\u2019s overwhelmed to be at Davos, having come from a small town in Saudi Arabia. As a child, her father showed her films (even though they were banned), which opened her eyes to a wider world. Al-Mansour says: It is important to expose children to art and film and culture, especially in conservative places. This will help create global citizens in places such as the Middle East, she explains, adding: Building culture makes a difference in the whole world. Composer Marin Alsop collects her award first. She thanks the World Economic Forum, and explains the value of music to young people. I firmly believe that art can transform lives, and everyone deserves a chance to experience it. She adds that learning an instrument at an early age helped her to develop valuable skills such as self-esteem. Unlike in maths, When you play a phrase on the violin, you\u2019re always right. Alsop now explains that she\u2019s proud to be the first woman to lead a major US orchestra, and the first to lead a major UK orchestra (the Bournemouth Symphony). She cites the support of her parents, for helping her to overcome hurdles as a female musician. Her advice - never give up. If the front door is locked, go round the side and get in through a window.... Alsop is now using her skills to bring music to underprivileged children in Baltimore. The children involved in this Orchids project are developing impressive skills -- one is about to be the first member of her family to go to college. After a very long, very successful career, Sir David Attenborough needs little introduction. But here\u2019s his citation from the World Economic Forum, for \u201chis leadership in environmental stewardship\u201d. Sir David Attenborough\u2019s broadcasting career spans more than six decades during which he has played an extraordinary role both reinventing and developing the medium of television and connecting people to the wonders of the natural world, bringing distant peoples, animals and habitats into living rooms across the planet. As a BBC producer and executive, he has played a crucial role in creating new forms of programming and scheduling that, to this day, influence global broadcasting. His work includes many iconic productions, from the ground-breaking \u201cZoo Quest\u201d series to landmarks including \u201cLife on Earth\u201d, \u201cThe Living Planet\u201d, \u201cThe Trials of Life\u201d, \u201cThe Private Life of Plants\u201d, \u201cLife of Mammals\u201d and \u201cPlanet Earth\u201d. At the Annual Meeting, Sir David will present key sequences from \u201cOur Planet\u201d, a new series by WWF, Netflix and Silverback Films, focusing on the preservation of life on Earth. Haifaa Al-Mansour is being honoured by WEF for her leadership in cultural transformation in the Arab world. WEF says: Haifaa Al-Mansour is the first female filmmaker in Saudi Arabia. \u201cWadjda\u201d, Al Mansour\u2019s feature debut, was the first feature film shot entirely in Saudi Arabia and the first by a female director. The success of her 2005 documentary \u201cWomen Without Shadows\u201d was a breakthrough that was followed by a new wave of Saudi filmmakers and front-page headlines of Saudi Arabia finally opening cinemas in the kingdom. She was recently appointed to the Board of the General Authority for Culture to advise on the development of the cultural and arts sectors in Saudi Arabia. She recently released \u201cMary Shelly\u201d starring Elle Fanning, and \u201cNappily Ever After\u201d starring Sanaa Lathan. Al Mansour is the first artist from the Arabian Gulf region to be invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Marin Alsop is being recognised today for her leadership in championing diversity in music. WEF says: Marin Alsop, Music Director of the Baltimore Symphony since 2007, is one of the greatest conductors of our time. Earlier this year she was the first woman to be appointed Chief Conductor of the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra and, in 2013, was the first woman in 118 years to conduct the BBC\u2019s \u201cLast Night of the Proms\u201d. She has tirelessly endeavored to provide opportunities for all people to access music for a world where diversity in classical music is the norm rather than the exception. In Baltimore she launched the \u201cOrchKids\u201d programme to serve the city\u2019s less privileged children, and the BSO Academy and Rusty Musicians for adult amateur musicians. She is also Music Director of the S\u00e3o Paulo Symphony Orchestra. A graduate of Yale University and a MacArthur Fellow (2005), at the Annual Meeting, she will lead the Opening Performance with the Taki Concordia Orchestra. Cowbell are ringing inside the Davos Congress Centre (it\u2019s a Swiss thing), to warn delegates that it\u2019s nearly time for the opening ceremony of this year\u2019s Annual Meeting. As usual, WEF are handing out three Crystal Awards, to individuals who have helped make the world a better place. This year, the awards are going to composer Marin Alsop, filmmaker Haifaa Al-Mansour, and broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough. They\u2019ll appear on stage in a few minutes, after WEF founder Klaus Schwab has spoken There\u2019s a lot of chatter about the state of the global economy on Davos\u2019s icy pavements (and snug rooms inside the security cordon). The IMF\u2019s growth downgrades will add to concerns... could we be facing a recession? Data firm IHS Global Insight thinks not. Its chief economist, Dr. Nariman Behravesh, predicts another year of growth, but below last year (as the IMF also expect). He adds: I anticipate World Economic Forum attendees will be anxious about financial turmoil and the potential damage from fallout over U.S. policies such as the simmering trade conflict between the U.S. and China and the U.S. government shutdown. However, U.S. companies will be more upbeat, compared with European and Chinese companies \u2013 especially those in the manufacturing sectors \u2013 as U.S. business conditions remain the strongest among the G7 nations. The mood of Chinese delegates is likely to be quite somber. Axel Weber is now hitting out at firms who misuse or are misnaming sustainable investment opportunities. The UBS chief tells his audience in Davos that greenwashing is often deployed for the headlines means \u201cthe whole industry gets discredited\u201d and creates pushback. It\u2019s \u201calmost like misselling\u201d, he added. UBS is kicking off its Davos agenda with a white paper warning that a lack of private funding is putting the UN Sustainable Development Goals \u201cat significant risk\u201d. It says the financial sector should be offering more personalised investment options and use \u201csimpler and more consistent sustainability data and terms\u201d. Axel Weber (centre left, below) is hosting the relatively intimate (read: small) gathering in the bank\u2019s retail outlet on the Pomenade in Davos, that\u2019s well stocked with drinks and hotdogs for guests. Over in Davos, the peace and tranquility of this small ski resort is being rudely interrupted as thousands of business leaders, politicians, economists, technologists and campaigners descend. While brightly clad childen hone their technique on the practice slopes, the roads below are chockablock with luxury limos and shuttle buses ferrying global elite around (your humble correspondent walked - it\u2019s cold, but lovely) Locals look unimpressed, but resigned to a week of disruption as the World Economic Forum gets underway. WEF gets a lot of stick, from critics who scoff that its attendees are mainly responsible for the world\u2019s problems. But the Forum insists it wants to make the world better - reduce inequality, tackle climate change, and use back against populism. And on that score, a new report has found that people around the globe are firmly in favour of co-operation between nations, and broadly supportive of migration. Europe, though, is less keen. The poll of more than 10,000 people found that: 80% of respondents worldwide believe that all countries can benefit at the same time, rejecting the notion that national improvement is a zero-sum game Europe is the only continent where people view immigrants as \u201cmostly bad.\u201d A majority of all respondents trust climate science, but 17% in North America express little to no trust Respondents in Eastern Europe/Central Asia and Western Europe see upward mobility as elusive in their country Majorities in all regions and super majorities in most regions think cooperation between countries is very or extremely important. Away from Davos: Now the festive fun has worn off and if the general economic doom and gloom were not enough to get you down, today is apparently Blue Monday \u2013 deemed the most depressing day of the year when we are most fed up and likely to apply for a new job or book a holiday \u2013 or even both, writes our consumer affairs correspondent Rebecca Smithers. To get people in the holiday mood, Heathrow Airport has launched Sound Escapes \u2013 an \u2018immersive\u2019 soundtrack created from over 24 hours of recordings inspired by passengers in collaboration with award-winning sound artist Nick Ryan. It features waves on a beach, the splash of a swimming pool and a plane taking off, which have all topped the list of sounds that help transport Brits to holidays, inspiring nearly half of travellers to book a getaway. Meanwhile a new study from hiring app Job Today says that while January is far from joy-free, Blue Monday marks the month when most of us take charge and make a change. The number of people searching for \u2018career change\u2019 skyrocketed in January by more than 40% of the monthly average, and nearly double that of December, as consumers seek to jump ship with their jobs to make good on the \u2018new year, new me\u2019 mantra.The app also recorded a 21% increase in job applications in January, compared to December. Of course it\u2019s also Dry January. And if you fancy drowning your sorrows after Christmas spending has caught up with you, Beck\u2019s Blue, the alcohol-free (sorry) beer brand is taking over Blue Monday. Brewing giant AB InBev\u2013 in partnership with pub group Mitchell and Butlers, is offering thirsty consumers a free bottle of Beck\u2019s Blue. Those interested have to apply for a voucher first. Magnanimously, the company hopes this will drum up a bit of extra custom for pubs at a quiet time of year\u2026 The International Monetary Fund has warned that the US-China trade war and weakness in Europe could trigger a sharp global slowdown, as it cut its growth forecasts for the world economy for the next two years \u2013 its second downgrade in three months. It also cited a sharper slowdown in China and a potential no-deal Brexit as major risks to its outlook. Speaking in Davos in Switzerland, where the global elite are gathering for the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting, the IMF\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, said: \u201cDoes that mean a global recession is around the corner? No. But the risk of a sharper decline in global growth has certainly increased.\u201d China\u2019s latest official data showed the world\u2019s second-biggest economy slowing to the weakest rate in 28 years in 2018, of 6.6%. On stock markets, the FTSE 100 index in London has just dipped into the red, trading down 3 points, at 6965.23. European markets are also in negative territory. Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.4% France\u2019s CAC down 0.2% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.58% Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.17% Sterling has edged off its earlier lows but remains volatile ahead of Theresa May\u2019s statement on her \u201cPlan B\u201d for Brexit. It is more or less flat against the dollar at $1.2873 and against the euro at 88.27 pence. In Davos, Tina Brown, the former editor of Vanity Fair and the New Yorker, and Credit Suisse will host their eighth annual Women of Impact dinner tomorrow. Every year, when more than 2,500 political and business leaders, policymakers, economists, celebrities and journalists pour into the Swiss resort, women are heavily outnumbered by men. The guests of honour at the dinner this year will be Michelle Bachelet, the first woman to serve as Chile\u2019s president who was recently appointed as the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and Lina Khalifeh, the founder of SheFighter, a self-defence studio that has already trained more than 15,000 women from all over the world. The dinner, which has previously honoured Amal Clooney, Ruth Davidson, Nadia Murad and Dr Rola Hallam among others, brings together 80 influential world leaders from business, government and media. The IMF\u2019s chief economist, Gita Gopinath, said the immediate and dominant risk to the British economy is Brexit, rather than China\u2019s slowdown \u2013 and the uncertainty around what happens at the end of March has already had an impact. We\u2019ve already seen the negative effect of this uncertainty on British investment. She said the IMF estimates the cost of a no deal Brexit, which would imply a reversal to WTO (World Trade Organisation) terms, to the British economy, would be a decline in long-run GDP of 5-8 percentage points. You can watch the IMF press conference here. Here are Lagarde\u2019s comments in full. After two years of solid expansion the world economy is growing more slowly than expected and risks are rising. It is facing significantly higher risks, some of them actually related to policy. She noted that higher tariffs and increased uncertainty over future trade policy had fed into lower asset prices and higher market volatility, which contributed to tightening finance conditions, including for advanced economies \u2013 a major risk in a world of high debt burden. Does that mean a global recession is around the corner? No. But the risk of a sharper decline in global growth has certainly increased. Here is our full story on the IMF\u2019s latest economic outlook, released in Davos, where the global elite are gathering for the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting. Here is some instant reaction to the IMF\u2019s growth forecast cuts. Asked about China, she said the slowdown \u2013 to an annual growth rate of 6.6% in 2018, the lowest since 1990 \u2013 was exactly what the IMF had expected. Nothing dramatic is happening at this point. The IMF\u2019s chief economist, Gita Gopinath, is taking questions on the latest forecasts. Referring to the \u201cBrexit cliffhanger,\u201d she said: A no deal Brexit is one of the major risks to our forecast. She said the forecasts assume there is a smooth transition to the new set-up, but if there is a disruptive exit or there is continued uncertainty for many more months, both of those are going to weigh negatively on economic growth going forward. She added that it was \u201cimperative\u201d for political leaders to resolve this uncertainty immediately. IMF head Christine Lagarde just spoke, at the start of the WEF meeting in Davos. She said while a global recession was not yet around the corner, the risk of a sharper decline in global economic growth had certainly increased. She added that policymakers must prepare for a serious slowdown, and called on them to reduce high levels of government debt to boost economic resilience. She concluded by saying: The international community must come together to build a brighter future for all. NEWSFLASH: The International Monetary Fund has cut its growth forecasts for the global economy for the next two years, and urged the US and China to resolve their trade war. Our man in Switzerland, Graeme Wearden, writes: In its latest World Economic Outlook, just released in Davos, the IMF warns that growth will slow to 3.5% in 2019, down from 3.7% in 2018, picking up to 3.6% in 2020. Back in October, the Fund forecast 3.7% growth in both 2019 and 2020; before worrying signs of weakness appeared, particularly in the euro area. Warning that \u201cThe global expansion has weakened\u201d, the IMF cited softer momentum in several economies, \u201cincluding in Germany following the introduction of new automobile fuel emission standards and in Italy where concerns about sovereign and financial risks have weighed on domestic demand.\u201d The IMF has slashed its forecast for German growth this year to just 1.3%, from 1.9% expected three months ago. Italy\u2019s projected growth rate in 2019 has also been lowered, from 1% to just 0.6%. The UK is expected to expand by 1.5% this year, up from 1.4% in 2018, and by 1.6% in 2020 (revised up from 1.5% in the last forecasts). But the Fund adds that there is still much uncertainty over the UK\u2019s prospects, given the risk of a no-deal Brexit. Warning that global risks are tilted downwards, the Fund adds: \u201cAn escalation of trade tensions beyond those already incorporated in the forecast remains a key source of risk to the outlook. Financial conditions have already tightened since the fall. A range of triggers beyond escalating trade tensions could spark a further deterioration in risk sentiment with adverse growth implications, especially given the high levels of public and private debt. These potential triggers include a \u201cno-deal\u201d withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and a greater-than-envisaged slowdown in China.\u201d China is expected to grow by 6.2% in 2019 and 2020, down from 6.6% last year. Given these risks, the Fund is calling - again - for an end to protectionist trade policies that hurt the global economy. It says: \u201cThe main shared policy priority is for countries to resolve cooperatively and quickly their trade disagreements and the resulting policy uncertainty, rather than raising harmful barriers further and destabilising an already slowing global economy. \u201c It\u2019s official: a number of firms have reduced pack sizes of consumer goods after the weak pound pushed up cost of imports following the 2016 Brexit vote. It\u2019s not just Mars shrinking its Maltesers, M&amp;Ms and Minstrels chocolate packs by up to 15%, and McVitie\u2019s cutting the number of Jaffa Cakes in a packet from 12 to 10. According to the Office for National Statistics, 206 individual items, from toilet roll to chocolate, were made smaller between September 2015 and June 2017, more than double the number that increased in size. This may be better for your waistline, but not for your wallet. \u201cShrinkflation\u201d refers to the practice of making goods smaller, while selling them at the same price. You can read the full story here. Back to China. Monday\u2019s economic data suggested the downturn may not be as severe as thought. The country\u2019s industrial output rose 5.7%, while retail sales increased 8.2% in December, compared to a year earlier. This suggests the hard landing scenario for the Chinese economy is diminishing, says Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at Russian bank VTB Capital. Numbers for industrial production and retail sales are now consistent with the stabilisation of economic activity. Upcoming PMI data for January can provide confirmation whether the prospect of a hard landing scenario for the Chinese economy is diminishing. The latest GDP data shows that annual growth in 2018 was 6.6%, the slowest since 1990, though many China-watchers question the veracity of the official data and believe that true growth is a lot lower, perhaps something like 2-3%, which would equate with at least stall-speed in terms of activity. The Chinese authorities have already loosened monetary and fiscal policy, though high levels of corporate debt and excess leverage can mitigate the impact on economic growth. Over in Japan, the former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn has offered to wear an electronic ankle tag and hire security guards to track his every move, in another bail request. Ghosn is awaiting trial on financial misconduct charges and has been in jail since he was arrested on 19 November. The Tokyo district court has already turned down one bail request, believing Ghosn to be a flight risk and that he could tamper with evidence over allegations that he underreported his income by tens of millions of dollars and transferred personal investment losses to Nissan. The case has rocked Japan\u2019s car industry and cast doubt over the future of the carmaker\u2019s alliance with Renault. You can read more here: The pound has slipped before Theresa May lays out her \u201cPlan B,\u201d designed to break the deadlock in parliament over Brexit. Sterling is down 0.2% against the dollar at $1.2847, and has lost 0.3% versus the euro, trading at 88.53 pence. The pound has stabilised above $1.28 since last week on expectations that Britain would not crash out of the EU without a deal. Ricardo Evangelista, a senior analyst at online broker ActivTrades in London, says: It is generally understood that the revised plan for a negotiated Brexit involves asking the EU for changes, in the \u2018back stop\u2019 arrangement; but being one of the Union\u2019s \u2018red lines\u2019, it is unlikely that any proposed changes to the controversial arrangement will be accepted. Therefore, the chances of any substantial developments in the process this Monday are slim and because of the that, sterling is likely to remain where it has been for the last week, just above $1.28, with traders pricing in comparatively low chances of a no deal Brexit, but also reflecting a large degree of uncertainty regarding the outcome of the negotiations. William Hill has warned (again) that full year profits will be down 15% from 2017, totalling \u00a3234m. The bookmaker already cut its profit forecast in November. The company said it would \u201cremodel [its] retail offer while building a digitally-led international business\u201d. It is looking at new products to offer alternatives to fixed-odds betting terminals, following the UK government\u2019s decision to slash maximum stakes on FOBTs from \u00a3100 to \u00a32. William Hill is also closing 900 betting shops in the UK, as announced last summer. Faced with the clampdown in Britain, the firm is pushing aggressively into the lucrative US sports betting market, after several states legalised betting on football, baseball, basketball and other sports. The chief executive of Just Eat, Peter Plumb, has left abruptly. The takeaway ordering website announced he had stepped down with immediate effect \u2013 just 16 months after joining the firm from MoneySavingExpert.com. Chief customer officer Peter Duffy will run the business until a permanent replacement is found. The shares dropped 3% on the news but are now slightly up. Plumb said: 2018 was another year of strong growth for the group. The business is in good health, and now is the right time for me to step aside and make way for a new leader for the next exciting wave of growth. The firm also upgraded its forecasts. It now anticipates 2018 orders of 221m, revenue of around \u00a3780m and underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of \u00a3172m-\u00a3174m. However, Plumb\u2019s strategy demanded more investment and led to a slowdown in earnings growth. He upgraded Just Eat\u2019s technology and launched its own delivery service in the face of increasing competition from Deliveroo and Uber Eats. The troubled cafe chain Patisserie Valerie issued a statement this morning, saying that talks with its banks continue and it will give an update when they are concluded. The chain is fighting for its survival. Luke Johnson, Patisserie Valerie\u2019s leading shareholder, has been seeking to extend a standstill agreement on its bank facilities, which officially expired at midnight on Friday. Without an agreement, the company\u2019s lenders, HSBC and Barclays, could demand repayment of debts that may amount to nearly \u00a310m, which could force Patisserie Valerie to call in administrators. You can read more here: Here\u2019s a round-up of this morning\u2019s corporate news. GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s chairman Sir Philip Hampton is to step down ahead of the company\u2019s split, which will see it spin off its consumer healthcare business in a \u00a310bn joint venture with its US rival Pfizer. The board has started looking for a successor. Hampton has been chairman of Britain\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical company since 2015. Before that, he chaired Royal Bank of Scotland. Hampton said: It is a privilege to serve as chairman of GSK. It is one of the UK\u2019s great companies and under Emma Walmsley\u2019s leadership, GSK has made very good progress with a new strategy and new approach to R&amp;D. Following the announcement of our deal with Pfizer and the intended separation of the new consumer business, I believe this is the right moment to step down and allow a new chair to oversee this process through to its conclusion over the next few years and to lead the board into this next phase for GSK. European stock markets slipped in early trade after hitting six-week highs last week, slightly unnerved by the Chinese slowdown. In London, the FTSE 100 index opened 0.1% lower but is now 0.13% ahead, a gain of 9 points, to 6977.80. Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.44% France\u2019s CAC down 0.3% Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.25% Some say China\u2019s problems are much deeper than the trade war, noting that productivity growth has been weak since the financial crisis. Bloomberg writes: This, along with flagging population growth, is a toxic economic combo. Meanwhile, the growing antagonism of China\u2019s trading partners is closing off access to cutting-edge technology. Since the crisis, Beijing has deployed bursts of credit-based stimulus to keep the economy moving. But this might feed the longer-term problem, [Bloomberg columnist] Noah Smith suggests, by pumping capital into local governments and pricey building projects that don\u2019t boost productivity. Far more than Trump, China may be stunting its own economic future. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at forex broker FXTM, says hopes of a US-China trade deal are propping up stock markets. Despite the complex situation, it seems markets are tending to believe that negotiations are moving in the right direction and this is likely to provide further support to risk sentiment. The release of Chinese GDP figures, which showed the economy has grown at its slowest pace in almost three decades, was not a surprise and this has been factored into asset prices. US trade tariffs have yet to deal direct significant impact to the country\u2019s growth, however, the ongoing trade dispute is leading to a further slowing in consumer consumption and business capital expenditures. While China may continue to use its monetary and fiscal tools to offset the damage done by the trade conflict, there\u2019s a limit on how much China may loosen policy given the swelling of its debt. It seems the only way for China to prevent a hard landing is to reach to a deal with the U.S., and that\u2019s what the markets are hoping for. Although Donald Trump denied reports that US tariffs on Chinese exports would be lifted, he said on Saturday that there has been progress towards a deal with China. \u201cThings are going very well with China and with trade,\u201d he told reporters at the White House. He added: If we make a deal certainly we would not have sanctions and if we don\u2019t make a deal we will. We\u2019ve really had a very extraordinary number of meetings and a deal could very well happen with China. It\u2019s going well. I would say about as well as it could possibly go. Chinese vice premier Liu He will head to the United States on 30 and 31 January for the next round of trade negotiations with Washington. Here is some reaction to the Chinese GDP data. ING economist Iris Pang says: The details show that the infrastructure investment is shaping up to be the engine for 2019. However, non-infrastructure business activities will be dismal this year. And debt will grow. Industrial production grew faster at 5.7% year-on-year in December from 5.4%YoY. However, again, when we look at the details, we find that capital expenditure related items are shrinking, not growing. For example, industrial robot production shrank 12.7%YoY. Retail sales tell a story of a cautious consumer, one that is not keen to spend on luxury items. For example, automobile sales fell 8.5%YoY in December. Turning to the trade war, she says 2019 will be a year of uncertainty, especially for electronics. Even though there are some signs of hope stemming from the negotiations on US-China trade, we believe that both sides will only agree on certain standard trade issues. However, the more important topics in the trade talk, intellectual property and the transfer of technology, are much more difficult to reach agreement on. And Liu He will not be able to decide on these topics alone. That\u2019s why we believe that by 1st March 2019, the trade talks may only have agreements on trade but not technology. In this case, there will be increasingly more developed economies, or even emerging economies, trying to ban the use of China-made electronic components and goods. That will hurt the production sector of electronics in China, and the prices of these items will fall in China. Producers of these electronic parts and goods will face an increased chance of close down, and debt default. To avoid this, the Chinese government has to allow these companies to issue bonds in the capital market or tap banks to repay their outstanding loans to survive. Debt levels will therefore increase. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. China\u2019s economic growth slowed to its slowest pace in 28 years in 2018 after years of rapid expansion, amid a damaging trade war with the US and weaker consumer spending. Official data out on Monday showed the world\u2019s second-biggest economy grew 6.6%, down from 6.8% in 2017 and the lowest rate since 1990. In the fourth quarter, Chinese GDP rose 6.4%, the slowest rate of growth since early 2009, the height of the financial crisis. The slowdown puts further pressure on Beijing to reach a deal with Washington to end the trade war that started last July after talks broke down. The figures also raise fears that China may no longer be able to help shore up weakening global growth, as it has until now. Asian markets held on to their gains, however, on hopes of stimulus measures from Beijing to counteract slowing growth. Policymakers have pledged more support this year but have ruled out a massive stimulus because in the past this resulted in a mountain of debt. Japan\u2019s Nikkei and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index both gained 0.3% while the two main Chinese indices were up more than 0.5% You can read more on China here: Investors and traders are also waiting for Theresa May\u2019s \u201cPlan B\u201d for Brexit, which she is due to present to parliament later today. The UK prime minister is expected to reject calls to forge a cross-party consensus on Brexit. US markets are closed today for Martin Luther King Day. Also coming up today.... The global elite are heading to Davos for the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting - a mix of speeches, discussions, top-level meetings, fireside chats and swanky parties. They\u2019ll be discussing the fourth industrial revolution, how to help those left behind by globalisation, the rise of populism, mental health, and the threat of climate change and extreme weather, among other topics. The meeting will begin tonight, when WEF hands its traditional crystal awards to top conductor Marin Alsop, pioneering Saudi Arabian film-maker Haifaa al-Mansour, and broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough. Before that, the International Monetary Fund will release a new assessment of the global economy, with a press conference at Davos. The agenda: 1pm GMT: IMF publishes its latest World Economic Outlook 5pm GMT: WEF opening ceremony and crystal awards",

Italy was admonished for almost wilfully throwing away its recovery in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/05/eurozone-finance-ministers-behind-eu-italy-budget-dispute\">dispute with the European Union</a> over its budget deficit.</p> <p>But the slowdown in the global economy over the past year and the worsening prospects for the next two years are almost entirely traced back to China and how well the Communist party leadership is handling the country\u2019s economic affairs.</p> <p>Given the task at hand, there is an argument for congratulating Beijing. After it came to the rescue of the global economy in 2009 with a monster package of spending and borrowing, it has tried to bring the debts of its state enterprises under control, temper speculative property buying and restrict banks from reckless lending. All this has happened while its leaders have sought to clean up the major cities (of corruption and dirty air) and raise approximately 10 million people out of poverty each year.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/05/china-economy-slowdown-us-tariffs-trade-war\">determination to punish China for its exporting prowess</a> could not have come at a worse time. The Communist party may have tightened its grip on economic activity and paid less heed to human rights abuses, but the capitalist genie is, to some extent, out of the bottle.</p> <p>The Chinese people from Shanghai to Chengdu like to speculate on property, the stock market and make money using cheap state finance and without paying too much attention to climate change.</p> <p>Until recently, Beijing could always turbo-charge exports and generate some extra income. With Trump\u2019s negotiators blocking that route with tariffs (watch out Britain, the president\u2019s trade team are difficult to please), China has seen its growth rate fall to its lowest level since 1990.</p> <p>The IMF boss, Christine Lagarde, was quick to downplay the potential for an imminent shock. She obviously wanted to sound more upbeat to her fellow citizens of the world, 1,500 metres up in the Swiss mountains.</p> <p>But she couldn\u2019t help warning that China\u2019s fate would determine the path for the rest of the world and that \u2013 without naming him \u2013 Trump should resolve his differences through negotiation and cooperation. Otherwise a difficult transition in China will founder, taking much of the world economy\u2019s growth with it.</p> <p>As wishful thinking goes, it is hard to beat.</p> <h2>A caring, sharing Davos</h2> <p>There are delegates in Davos who breathed a sigh of relief when Trump announced that he and his delegation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/17/trump-pelosi-trip-abroad-military-cancelled-shutdown\">would not be turning up</a> this year as planned. Time to think, they said. Especially about sharing.</p> <p>Lagarde, who was Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s right-of-centre finance minister before taking the IMF job, said on her arrival: \u201cSolidarity is in all our self-interest.\u201d</p> <p>The theme of sharing covers inequality, diversity, climate change and, at the top of the schedule on the first day, health.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Davos, the approach is mostly about the self, in line with Lagarde\u2019s theme. So caring for someone in your community will make you more productive in your job. Opting for a career in the health industry will give job security in a world of ageing and increasingly unhealthy populations.</p> <p>On the other hand, sharing the wealth accumulated by the richest 1%, many of whom are at the WEF, does not appear to rank very high on the agenda.</p>",

      "bodyText": "These days it does not matter how much the US economy is pumped with steroids, if China cannot keep pace, the rest of the world slows down. Even the US begins to stagger. That is the message from the International Monetary Fund, which has supplemented its usual March and October biannual health checks on the global economy with a handy interim report timed to coincide with the Davos business and political leaders\u2019 summit. Where once the US was a V8 engine driving the global economy, now it has an equal partner on the other side of the Pacific. In a short report directed at the business leaders and \u201cthinkers\u201d attending the World Economic Forum, there were warnings about a no-deal Brexit and the shockwaves it would send through the global economic and financial systems. Italy was admonished for almost wilfully throwing away its recovery in a dispute with the European Union over its budget deficit. But the slowdown in the global economy over the past year and the worsening prospects for the next two years are almost entirely traced back to China and how well the Communist party leadership is handling the country\u2019s economic affairs. Given the task at hand, there is an argument for congratulating Beijing. After it came to the rescue of the global economy in 2009 with a monster package of spending and borrowing, it has tried to bring the debts of its state enterprises under control, temper speculative property buying and restrict banks from reckless lending. All this has happened while its leaders have sought to clean up the major cities (of corruption and dirty air) and raise approximately 10 million people out of poverty each year. Unfortunately, Donald Trump\u2019s determination to punish China for its exporting prowess could not have come at a worse time. The Communist party may have tightened its grip on economic activity and paid less heed to human rights abuses, but the capitalist genie is, to some extent, out of the bottle. The Chinese people from Shanghai to Chengdu like to speculate on property, the stock market and make money using cheap state finance and without paying too much attention to climate change. Until recently, Beijing could always turbo-charge exports and generate some extra income. With Trump\u2019s negotiators blocking that route with tariffs (watch out Britain, the president\u2019s trade team are difficult to please), China has seen its growth rate fall to its lowest level since 1990. The IMF boss, Christine Lagarde, was quick to downplay the potential for an imminent shock. She obviously wanted to sound more upbeat to her fellow citizens of the world, 1,500 metres up in the Swiss mountains. But she couldn\u2019t help warning that China\u2019s fate would determine the path for the rest of the world and that \u2013 without naming him \u2013 Trump should resolve his differences through negotiation and cooperation. Otherwise a difficult transition in China will founder, taking much of the world economy\u2019s growth with it. As wishful thinking goes, it is hard to beat. A caring, sharing Davos There are delegates in Davos who breathed a sigh of relief when Trump announced that he and his delegation would not be turning up this year as planned. Time to think, they said. Especially about sharing. Lagarde, who was Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s right-of-centre finance minister before taking the IMF job, said on her arrival: \u201cSolidarity is in all our self-interest.\u201d The theme of sharing covers inequality, diversity, climate change and, at the top of the schedule on the first day, health. At Davos, the approach is mostly about the self, in line with Lagarde\u2019s theme. So caring for someone in your community will make you more productive in your job. Opting for a career in the health industry will give job security in a world of ageing and increasingly unhealthy populations. On the other hand, sharing the wealth accumulated by the richest 1%, many of whom are at the WEF, does not appear to rank very high on the agenda.",

There is a grotesque quality to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/20/spice-girls-comic-relief-tshirts-made-bangladesh-factory-paying-staff-35p-an-hour\" title=\"\">the Guardian\u2019s revelations</a> of the conditions under which Bangladeshi women in the garment industry labour to make Western women feel charitable and empowered. The T-shirts made in Bangladesh will ultimately sell for \u00a319.60, of which a little more than half, \u00a311.60, will go to Comic Relief, to help champion equality for women. The celebrities who promote them, and whom the T-shirts in turn promote with their slogan \u201cI wanna be a Spice Girl\u201d, are well-paid; the women who make them are paid around 35p an hour and expected to sew up to 2,000 in the course of a working day, which is anything from eight to 16 hours long. To put it another way, a Bangladeshi seamstress would have to sew at least 7,000 T-shirts to afford the price charged for one in the west \u2013 and buying or wearing one is supposed to be a way of championing \u201cequality and people power\u201d.</p> <p>No one suggests that the westerners involved are insincere. They genuinely want to improve the lives of women around the world, and Comic Relief has done really impressive work. The people who buy the shirts will be horrified by this story. They would happily pay for their empowering T-shirts to be produced in conditions that actually empowered the workers who made them, as well as contributing to the empowerment of others elsewhere. Why is this so difficult?</p> <p>One answer lies in the vast gap between regulations and enforcement. The decent and generous impulses of people all around the world, and not just in the countries where the T-shirts are purchased, are expressed in political aspirations, and these in regulations and in laws. But those are completely worthless if they are not enforced, and in countries without democracy there\u2019s no enforcement that goes against the interests of the powerful. Not even the 2013 Rana Plaza disaster, when 1,134 people were killed in a factory collapse, has changed enough.</p> <p>Democracy is not a matter of elections. The Bangladeshi government of Sheikh Hasina has just won an election with her party, the Awami League, claiming 96% of the vote. 600,000 troops and police were deployed to oversee it, but on election day 17 people died.

      "bodyText": "Who carries the weight of a global supply chain? Whose lives are bound in its fetters? There is a grotesque quality to the Guardian\u2019s revelations of the conditions under which Bangladeshi women in the garment industry labour to make Western women feel charitable and empowered. The T-shirts made in Bangladesh will ultimately sell for \u00a319.60, of which a little more than half, \u00a311.60, will go to Comic Relief, to help champion equality for women. The celebrities who promote them, and whom the T-shirts in turn promote with their slogan \u201cI wanna be a Spice Girl\u201d, are well-paid; the women who make them are paid around 35p an hour and expected to sew up to 2,000 in the course of a working day, which is anything from eight to 16 hours long. To put it another way, a Bangladeshi seamstress would have to sew at least 7,000 T-shirts to afford the price charged for one in the west \u2013 and buying or wearing one is supposed to be a way of championing \u201cequality and people power\u201d. No one suggests that the westerners involved are insincere. They genuinely want to improve the lives of women around the world, and Comic Relief has done really impressive work. The people who buy the shirts will be horrified by this story. They would happily pay for their empowering T-shirts to be produced in conditions that actually empowered the workers who made them, as well as contributing to the empowerment of others elsewhere. Why is this so difficult? One answer lies in the vast gap between regulations and enforcement. The decent and generous impulses of people all around the world, and not just in the countries where the T-shirts are purchased, are expressed in political aspirations, and these in regulations and in laws. But those are completely worthless if they are not enforced, and in countries without democracy there\u2019s no enforcement that goes against the interests of the powerful. Not even the 2013 Rana Plaza disaster, when 1,134 people were killed in a factory collapse, has changed enough. Democracy is not a matter of elections. The Bangladeshi government of Sheikh Hasina has just won an election with her party, the Awami League, claiming 96% of the vote. 600,000 troops and police were deployed to oversee it, but on election day 17 people died. Few believe the results represent popular sentiment. But democracy requires more than credible elections. It needs a robust civil society \u2013 free speech and powerful trade unions. Both are hard to find in Bangladesh today. Journalists and political dissidents have been ruthlessly persecuted; Islamists have murdered atheist bloggers. The factory where the exploitation has been exposed is owned by Shahriar Alam, a Bangladeshi foreign affairs minister, who told our reporter that he didn\u2019t think it was \u201cright from a journalistic point of view to add [his] name to this story\u201d. Who can doubt his sincerity? He really doesn\u2019t want his name in the paper. Bangladesh is not alone in having a garment sector in which workers are ruthlessly exploited.

      "bodyText": "Tesco, Marks &amp; Spencer and Mothercare use a factory in Bangladesh that paid the equivalent of 35p an hour to machinists making Spice Girls T-shirts sold to raise money for Comic Relief, it can be revealed. A Guardian investigation disclosed that the predominantly female employees claimed they experienced verbal abuse and harassment from management during shifts of up to 16 hours. Workers at the factory produced the \u00a319.40 T-shirts, which were emblazoned with the message \u201c#IWannaBeASpiceGirl\u201d, to raise money for the charity\u2019s \u201cgender justice\u201d campaign. But employees said they were called \u201cdaughters of prostitutes\u201d by managers for not hitting \u201cimpossible\u201d targets and claimed employees were forced to work despite being ill. The Spice Girls and Comic Relief said they had been kept in the dark about a change of manufacturer and were \u201cshocked\u201d by the findings. Now it has emerged that Interstoff Apparels, which makes millions of pounds in profits and is co-owned by a Bangladeshi government minister, also produces garments for major British retailers. Tesco and M&amp;S launched investigations after the revelations, while Mothercare, which sells clothing for babies, children and expectant mothers, said it would be reviewing the findings. Labour\u2019s Mary Creagh said the news was a \u201cwake-up call\u201d and urged retailers to do more to ensure workers producing clothes for them are not abused. The MP, who chairs the environmental audit committee, which has been investigating the garment industry, said: \u201cThere is no reason for any British retailer to tolerate these abuses in the labour supply chain. \u201cI remarked in one of our inquiries that large supermarkets can tell me more about the lives of the animals that we are eating than about the people who make our clothes. \u201cThere is a bitter irony that a band founded on girl power makes a T-shirt promoting gender equality through exploiting the rights of women and girls with poverty wages and harsh working conditions. The band should have double- and triple-checked with their supplier.\u201d Comic Relief said it was \u201cshocked and concerned\u201d and both the charity and Spice Girls had checked the ethical sourcing credentials of the online retailer commissioned by the band to make the T-shirts, but it had subsequently changed manufacturer without their knowledge. The Spice Girls said they were \u201cdeeply shocked and appalled\u201d by the Guardian\u2019s findings and would personally fund an investigation into the factory\u2019s working conditions. But the Labour MP Rushanara Ali, who is the government\u2019s trade envoy to Bangladesh, called on the band do more to help impoverished Bangladeshi garment workers and \u201clearn from this terrible mistake\u201d. She said: \u201cI think it\u2019s utterly shocking that the due diligence hasn\u2019t been done successfully enough to prevent the sale and purchase of these goods when people are being paid so badly and treated so appallingly. \u201cAlthough there has been some improvement in the country since the Rana Plaza incident, where over 1,100 people lost their lives, what\u2019s needed is celebrities like the Spice Girls to get behind campaigns to improve labour standards, pay and conditions for garment workers in Bangladesh and other countries in the developing world.\u201d The MP, who is the vice-chairwoman of the all-party parliamentary group on Bangladesh, added: \u201cI think it\u2019s important that celebrities don\u2019t end up having their fingers burnt and stepping back altogether, as I think they have a positive role to play. \u201cThey need to put their money where their mouth is, redouble their efforts and do more substantive work rather than one-off campaigns like this, which has blown up in their faces.\u201d Interstoff Apparels has said the Guardian\u2019s findings would be investigated but were \u201csimply not true\u201d. M&amp;S confirmed the company has been working with Interstoff for 13 years. A spokesman added: \u201cWe will be investigating this incident. We take any allegation against factories we work with extremely seriously and we have already arranged for a compliance manager to visit as soon as possible. \u201cIn addition to there being regular M&amp;S presence at the factory, we work with the factory on a number of programmes including gender equality and healthcare projects.\u201d Tesco said it was investigating. Mothercare said it took staff welfare \u201cvery seriously\u201d, adding that the retailer \u201cworks in close dialogue with all factories\u201d and would be reviewing the information. A spokesman added: \u201cMothercare has a code of practice, based on the Ethical Trading Initiative code, which outlines the labour standards expected at all factories, which forms part of our conditions of trade. \u201cBefore production is approved, all factories must provide an independent factory ethical audit from a shortlist of providers, to demonstrate that they comply with our code of practice. \u201cThese audits are then reviewed and graded. Dependent on the findings, the factory is approved for production and a corrective action plan is issued, detailing any areas where the factory needs to improve. Factories found to have issues in the audit are not approved for production. \u201cMothercare requires that once a factory is approved for production, an independent ethical audit is then renewed on an annual basis to ensure continued adherence with the code.\u201d",

Represent said it took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for problems identified by a Guardian investigation this week. But it is little surprise that workers at the Bangladesh factory where the T-shirts were made were paid less than the local living wage. Countries such as Bangladesh are popular places in which to operate because they offer cheap labour alongside expertise in clothing manufacture. The legal minimum wage for garment workers in the country is 8,000 taka (\u00a373.85) a month, slightly less than the amount received by workers spoken to by the Guardian. The amount was increased by 2,700Tk a month in December, but campaigners say workers need 16,000Tk to live a comfortable life in Bangladesh.

But action to increase union representation in Bangladesh and other supplier countries has been slow, as union leaders and members can face intimidation because business owners and some governments see activists as a threat. Where local regulation and union representation is weak, retailers have traditionally tried to weed out poor factories with regular inspections carried out by their own staff or professional ethical auditors. Sedex, which has 50,000 members in more than 150 countries, enables brands to share data on ethical standards at thousands of factories around the world.

The best retailers have teams on the ground who work closely with suppliers to monitor conditions and check details about the capacities of factories and the time needed to carry out particular work projects. Such a detailed investigation can then identify when unrealistically low price points are being quoted \u2013 prices that can prompt factory owners to cut corners by forcing staff to do unpaid overtime or outsourcing work to less reputable establishments that may not have been inspected.

Take the reaction to the car crash in which the Duke of Edinburgh wasn\u2019t injured: there were artist\u2019s impressions of Philip in its aftermath, \u201cfact files\u201d about the vehicle he was driving, stories about the Queen being (as usual) driven to church (in a different car) \u201cjust days\u201d after the accident, and what it might have meant that Philip wasn\u2019t with her. Or take the recent tabloid story that claimed to find the likeness of Princess Charlotte in the intricacies of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex\u2019s knees. Or, the one about Meghan shutting a car door, which was reported along with commentary such as: \u201cThe Duchess of Sussex closing her own car door is yet another silent signal that she is going to be doing things her own way.\u201d These are not the signs of a nation in a healthy relationship with its sovereign. It isn\u2019t just print \u2013 TV can\u2019t handle the royals either. It\u2019s partly the contradictory tone: sombre, reverent, Attenborough closing in on a family of leopards \u2013 with just a whiff of jovial condescension. It\u2019s partly the array of \u201cexperts\u201d and \u201cinsiders\u201d providing such electrifying gossip as the fact that the Queen has a tremendous sense of duty. But mostly it\u2019s the voice, the one that everyone \u2013 from reporters outside the Lindo Wing to documentary narrators \u2013 must slip into when talking about the royals on television: bright, reassuring, the voice of a primary school teacher supervising an emergency evacuation. For this is the only voice in which it is possible to pull off the particular trick of royal commentary, in which you must relate incredibly mundane things as if desperately trying to deflect attention from dangerous national secrets bubbling beneath. This is not the voice of a journalist trying to reveal things so much as trying to conceal them, as indeed they often are: the main task of royal reporting being to make it seem as if there is news when there is not. Can the media even claim to be holding the monarchy to account? The strange thing is that even critical stories about the royals are framed in reference to royal protocol, or the reputation of the palace. True, some newspapers have run pieces criticising Philip for failing to apologise to the other people involved in the crash (although perhaps not with the vigour they would a non-royal public figure) and querying whether at the age of 97 \u201cdefiant Philip\u201d should be driving without a seat belt so soon after his \u201cmiraculous\u201d escape. But most of the questions raised in the press were similar to those you\u2019d imagine being asked in Buckingham Palace\u2019s comms room. Should a replacement Land Rover have been delivered so quickly, or was that \u201cbad for PR\u201d? How should the palace best handle the three real victims of the car crash? Did it look bad that it was the Queen\u2019s lady-in-waiting, and not Prince Philip, who left well wishes for Emma Fairweather, the woman who was injured in the collision \u2013 and in a voicemail at that? The institution is defended even as its members and their aides are ticked off for breaking its rules. Somehow the media has become a ferocious guardian of royal convention \u2013 a sort of Julian Fellowes figure, scolding Downton Abbey cast members for using the wrong fork. Is this what the public wants from royal journalism? It seems unlikely. The BBC received thousands of complaints for over-covering the royal birth in 2013. And amid wall-to-wall royal coverage in the run-up to Harry and Meghan\u2019s wedding last year, one survey found some two thirds of people weren\u2019t interested in the event at all. In so far as the public approve of the monarchy, they tend to justify it as good for national morale, but I can\u2019t believe the kind of attention the royals get in the media cheers anyone up \u2013 it is instead a rather depressing spectacle. If there was ever a reason to reconsider getting rid of the monarchy, as we build up to the birth of Meghan\u2019s first child in April, it is to save our profession its self-respect. \u2022 Martha Gill is a political journalist",

And it has.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Most commentators think that, in reality, May has not particularly acknowledged the need to change, and that any change she is implementing is incremental.

And the third proposal is exactly what she was saying before Christmas.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She announced that the government is abolishing the \u00a365 fee for EU nationals applying for settled status.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And having listened to concerns from members \u2013 and organisations like the \u201cThe 3 Million\u201d group - I can confirm today that when we roll out the scheme in full on 30th March, the government will waive the application fee so that there is no financial barrier for any EU nationals who wish to stay.

(See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/21/brexit-latest-news-mays-statement-mps-commons-deal-will-be-absolute-disaster-says-business-minister-as-may-prepares-to-address-mps-politics-live?page=with:block-5c458c6ce4b0197a614f714e#block-5c458c6ce4b0197a614f714e\"> 9.15am.)</a> Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Rees-Mogg said he was strongly opposed to the government scheme requiring EU nationals living in the UK to pay \u00a365 for settled status to stay in the country. </strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families\">The scheme is now open. </a>Asked about it, Rees-Mogg said that he was \u201cagainst it\u201d and that he agreed with people who felt this was not what Brexiters voted for. He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are saying to people who\u2019ve been living her legally, who had had all the right papers to be here, that they must have a new paper for which they must pay. They should have it free in the same way as a birth certificate is free.</p> \n   <p>I feel very strongly about this. I think the tone of the debate on EU nationals here has been very wrong. Any of our listeners, EU nationals that are living here, in my view we should be really honoured that they came to this country. They came here legally. They have contributed to our society. They were very hard. And very often they have send money back to their families at home. It\u2019s a conservative and noble thing to do. It\u2019s family-based, very often, it\u2019s hard-work based and it\u2019s entrepreneurial. And to say to them, because we\u2019ve changed our relationship with the European Union, that their lives should be changed is to my mind unfair. We should have said, in June 2016, that they could all stay ... and the \u00a365 charge should, in my view, be waived. It\u2019s unreasonable. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He defended Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision not to participate in Theresa May\u2019s cross-party Brexit talks.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In defence of Jeremy Corbyn, the job of the opposition is to oppose, not to make the life of the government easy. And it is not unreasonable of him to say, \u2018Well, actually no, you\u2019re responsible, you won the election, if you don\u2019t want to to do it, if you want me to help you, I\u2019ll take over as prime minister, thank you very much.\u2019</p> \n   <p>So I think Theresa May was right to ask him. And he was not unreasonable to refuse - possibly politically naive to refuse, but not unreasonable.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Rees-Mogg also said Corbyn might have gained more politically by attending the talks, and then criticising May afterwards for being too dogmatic. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The greatest political advantage for [Corbyn] would have been to go in for talks, and then come and say, \u2018This was a complete waste of time because ...\u2019 Whereas I think saying no, and setting the pre-condition, then makes Jeremy Corbyn looks inflexible and dogmatic and does not help his opposition.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Ironically Rees-Mogg\u2019s argument is almost exactly the same as one made by<strong> Tony Blair </strong>in <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tony-blair-interview-on-brexit-it-s-not-an-outrage-to-go-back-to-the-people-after-30-months-of-total-mess-9gtwx9gkl\">an interview in the Times (paywall)</a> on Saturday. Talking about what Corbyn should have done, Blair said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Why wouldn\u2019t you go in the door, come out on the steps of Downing Street and say, \u2018I have had a conversation with her and I\u2019m afraid she doesn\u2019t understand how to resolve this and I do\u2019.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Rees-Mogg said he thought a no-deal Brexit was now the most likely outcome. </strong>Asked what he expected to happen, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think, if you were to rank them, the most likely is no deal. The second most likely is a redone deal. Third is delay. And fourth, a long way behind is not leaving at all.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked about the chances of there being a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d, he said he saw that as a \u201closers\u2019 vote\u201d and thought the proposal had got \u201cremarkably little support\u201d.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Rees-Mogg said he was still a fan of John Bercow, the speaker, despite Bercow deciding to reinterpret Commons rules two weeks ago in a way that angered Brexiters.</strong> Rees-Mogg explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think [Bercow] came to the wrong decision, but I don\u2019t think he came to the wrong decision for the wrong reason. I think he came to it for the right reason.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Rees-Mogg said he would like to see the Conservative party reunite with parts of Ukip.</strong> Asked if Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, should be allowed to join the Conservative party, he said:<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If the Conservative party could reunite with the reasonable elements of Ukip that would be very good news and Nigel would be part of that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Rees-Mogg said that admitting Farage be \u201cmuch easier now than it would have been when he was still a member of Ukip\u201d, because of Ukip\u2019s new links with Tommy Robinson. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It may be a little bit early, though personally I hold Nigel in the highest regard and think he was one of the people who was instrumental in delivering Brexit ... but perhaps a little bit more purdah is required.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-21T10:59:59.621Z\">at 10.59am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c459d04e4b0197a614f71c6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-21T10:27:53.747Z\">10.27am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">London needs to say what it wants on Brexit, says German foreign minister</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In Brussels, arriving for the EU foreign affairs council, the German foreign affairs minister<strong> Heiko Maas</strong> said EU ministers need to hear what the UK wants.

When LBC\u2019s Nick Ferrari put it to him that, outside London, people were far less worried about a no-deal Brexit than some Westminster politicians, Rees-Mogg agreed.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1431e83518838b50ac6f06295f11eeefca1a133f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1431e83518838b50ac6f06295f11eeefca1a133f/22_0_608_365/500.png\" alt=\"Jacob Rees-Mogg\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacob Rees-Mogg</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LBC</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c458278e4b00173154a8337\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-21T09:04:21.741Z\">9.04am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">No-deal Brexit will be 'absolute disaster', says business minister</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Richard Harrington</strong>, the business minister, has already said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/08/brexit-latest-news-no-deal-amendment-liam-fox-says-backing-amendment-designed-to-make-no-deal-harder-would-be-irresponsible-politics-live?page=with:block-5c346c55e4b0cebe76181fdf#block-5c346c55e4b0cebe76181fdf\">he will resign from the government if Theresa May opts for a not-deal Brexit.</a> Other ministers, including some in cabinet, think that same, but Harrington has been the most explicit about this. And this morning, in an interview on the Today programme, he went further. He said a no-deal Brexit (something May has refused to rule out, and something which Tory Brexiters insist would be manageable, if not ideal) would be \u201can absolute disaster\u201d. Asked what he thought about the prospect, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You said, \u201cDoes [the prospect of no deal] bring shivers?\u201d It does bring more than shivers, because I have examined in depth what might happen, I\u2019m part of the government\u2019s plans for Brexit. I\u2019ve seen what may well happen with this cut-off date. Crashing out in my view ... is an absolute disaster. It\u2019s not a road to a free trade agreement, it\u2019s not a road to anything. It\u2019s an absolute disaster for the country and it\u2019s supported by a minority of a minority of people.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Harrington said he was not just worried about the tariffs that would be in place in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He was worried about the impact of friction at the border, particularly on the car industry, which is dependent on just-in-time supply chains. He said he was \u201cafraid\u201d of Jaguar and Mini closing in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Claiming that the UK would be able to manage trading with the EU on WTO terms was \u201cfanciful nonsense\u201d, he said.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May has identified what she described as \u201cthree key changes\u201d that she claimed that she would be making to her Brexit policy. She did so as she delivered a statement to MPs - something she was obliged to do under the EU Withdrawal Act following the defeat of her plan in the Common last week. (See 5.01pm.) Critics said the changes she identified were ones she has promised before, and that she was not offering MPs anything particularly new, or anything with obvious potential to break the parliamentary deadlock. The government is to waive the planned fee for EU nationals living in the UK to apply for settled status after Brexit, May has said. Peers have defeated the government in the Lords by voting to hold up proceedings on the trade bill until ministers give parliament more details on how international trade agreements will be struck and scrutinised after Brexit. (See 5.11pm.) Commenting on the vote, Nick Dearden from Global Justice Now said: We\u2019re absolutely delighted that parliament has started to assert its power over this awful bill. The government should never have introduced a trade bill that failed to give proper powers to parliament to scrutinise, debate and discuss Britain\u2019s post-Brexit trade deals \u2013 given the vast changes that could be made to our food standards and public services in such deals. The British government would have no say over new trade deals if it was in a customs union with the European Union, a former head of the World Trade Organization has said. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Here is Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy on the government\u2019s decision to scrap the charge for EU nationals applying for settled status. At the end of last week, in an interview with the Times (paywall), the defence minister Tobias Ellwood said the government should delay Brexit if it cannot get its deal through parliament by 29 March. Leaving with no agreement would \u201cbe an act of self harm with profound economic, security and reputational, consequences for the UK at the very time threats are increasing and diversifying,\u201d he told the paper. Today he is tweeting about banana cake to make the same point. May\u2019s statement is now over. John Bercow, the speaker, says 107 backbenchers were able to ask a question. Labour\u2019s Debbie Abrahams asks what May thinks about the idea of using citizens\u2019 assemblies to come up with a compromise plan on Brexit. May says, as the government goes forward, the government will be looking at what methods can be used to ensure that people\u2019s voices are heard. (The reference to \u201cgoing forward\u201d implies that this is an idea that she might consider after Brexit, as the government negotiates the UK-EU trade deal, rather than something that she would use to resolve the current Brexit impasse.) This is what journalists and commentators are saying about Theresa May\u2019s statement. From the Guardian\u2019s Paul Johnson From the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil From the Guardian\u2019s Heather Stewart From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From the Guardian\u2019s Patrick Wintour From the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson From the Evening Standard\u2019s Nicholas Cecil From the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes From the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith Labour\u2019s Paul Farrelly asks May why she has been unable to say this afternoon if she will implement the result if MPs vote for an amendment next week proposing an alternative Brexit approach. May says the people gave the government an instruction in the referendum. She wants MPs to vote for a deal implementing it. Fiona Hyslop, Scotland\u2019s external affairs and culture secretary, has attacked Theresa May for continuing with plans to require EU citizens to register to stay after Brexit. Hyslop said it was welcome the UK government had finally bowed to pressure and scrapped the \u00a365 registration fee for EU citizens who wanted to stay, but added that it should never have been introduced. She said: This does not change the fact that EU citizens should not be asked to apply simply to retain the rights that they already have to live, work and study in Scotland. This has caused real anxiety for EU citizens in Scotland, who contribute so much to our economy and society. Fees charged as part of the pilot scheme introduced today by the UK government should be dropped immediately. Business groups have expressed alarm that parliament does not seem to be getting any closer to agreeing a Brexit deal. This is from Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general. While the government\u2019s move to consult more widely is welcome, as is the commitment to scrap the settled status charge for EU citizens, the fundamentals have not changed. Parliament remains in deadlock while the slope to a cliff edge steepens. The government should accept that no-deal in March 2019 must be off the table. Politicians on both sides of the Commons need to step back from their increasingly entrenched positions ... There must be a new cross-party approach, where leaders compromise and find a path that safeguards the economy. And this is from Allie Renison, head of Europe and trade policy at the Institute of Directors. The stasis continues. The prime minister\u2019s statement was correct to the extent that Parliament does have to come together over a plan if no deal is to be avoided. There is lots of talk of \u2018taking no deal off the table\u2019, but the law is clear that the UK will leave the EU on 29 March, with or without a withdrawal agreement. Two-thirds of our members say that leaving without a deal would be negative for their businesses and nearly 80% made clear they don\u2019t want to see it happen. We desperately need politicians to get serious about finding a way forward. In response to a question from the Tory Charlie Elphicke, May says those MPs trying to use parliamentary procedure to frustrated Brexit need to \u201cthink very carefully\u201d about what they are doing, because the public does not want to see Brexit stopped. The government has been defeated in the Lords over its plans for post-Brexit trade deals. As the Press Association reports, in a highly unusual move peers voted by 243 to 208, majority 35, to block the trade bill\u2019s report stage until they get fuller details of the plans. The move - branded a \u201ctactic of obstruction\u201d by the government - has no impact on the four days of committee stage debate on the bill starting today. But it will mean the measure\u2019s subsequent report stage will not start until the government has complied with Labour\u2019s demand to give parliament more details on how international trade agreements will be struck and scrutinised after Brexit. Labour\u2019s Peter Kyle refers to what May said in her opening statement about how a second referendum would undermine social cohesion. (See 5.01pm.) But only a small number of people would react like that, he says. When did the Conservative party stop standing up to fascists and start giving in to them instead? May says that remark is beneath Kyle. She says throughout her political career she has seen other countries hold second referendums when leaders did not like the result. She has always opposed that, she suggests. She says leaders should accept the results for referendums. Here are the main points from Theresa May\u2019s opening statement. It contained more substance that many of her Brexit statements have done (not that that\u2019s saying much), but it did not quite amount to the wholly new approach she seemed to promise at the start. May claimed that she has changed her approach to Brexit in response to last week\u2019s defeat. At the start of her speech she said: Mr Speaker, turning to Brexit, following last week\u2019s vote it is clear that the government\u2019s approach had to change. And it has. Most commentators think that, in reality, May has not particularly acknowledged the need to change, and that any change she is implementing is incremental. (Eg, see 1.02pm.) She seemed to confirm this at the end of her statement when she summed up the three main changes she is planning. My sense so far is that three key changes are needed. First, we will be more flexible, open and inclusive in the future in how we engage parliament in our approach to negotiating our future partnership with the European Union. Second, we will embed the strongest possible protections on workers\u2019 rights and the environment. And third, we will work to identify how we can ensure that our commitment to no hard border in Northern Ireland and Ireland can be delivered in a way that commands the support of this House, and the European Union. Of these proposals, the first two are ones that May has already made in the Commons before (although she fleshed them out in a bit more detail today). And the third proposal is exactly what she was saying before Christmas. She announced that the government is abolishing the \u00a365 fee for EU nationals applying for settled status. And having listened to concerns from members \u2013 and organisations like the \u201cThe 3 Million\u201d group - I can confirm today that when we roll out the scheme in full on 30th March, the government will waive the application fee so that there is no financial barrier for any EU nationals who wish to stay. And anyone who has or will apply during the pilot phase will have their fee reimbursed. More details about how this will work will be made available in due course. Of course, it was May\u2019s government that introduced the fee in the first place. Even the Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg argued that it was impossible to justify. (See 10.49am.) And so perhaps this U-turn was inevitable. When Rees-Mogg is making you look illiberal, you are in real trouble ... She said that she wanted \u201ca wide range of voices\u201d, from inside parliament and outside, to contribute to Brexit policy when the UK-EU trade deal is being negotiated. She said this should include select committees, the devolved authorities, elected representatives from Northern Ireland, representatives from the English regions, businesses, civil society and unions. She said: The political declaration will provide the basis for developing our detailed negotiating mandate for the future. And this new phase of negotiations will be different in a number of ways. It will cover a far broader range of issues in greater depth, and so will require us to build a negotiating team that draws on the widest expertise available \u2013 from trade negotiators to security experts and specialists in data and financial services. And as we develop our mandate across each of these areas I want to provide reassurance to the House. Given the breadth of the negotiations we will seek input from a wide range of voices from outside government. She also said that consulting select committees at this stage of the process could involve the government giving evidence to them in private, so that MPs could be kept informed without the negotiating position being undermined. She said the government would consider legislating if necessary to implement the John Mann amendment on workers\u2019 rights. She said: I will ensure that we provide parliament with a guarantee that not only will we not erode protections for workers\u2019 rights and the environment but we will ensure this country leads the way. To that end [Greg Clark, the business secretary] indicated the government\u2019s support for the proposed amendment to the meaningful vote put down by [John Mann]\u2013 including that parliament should be able to consider any changes made by the EU in these areas in future. [Clark] others will work with members across the House, businesses and trade unions, to develop proposals that give effect to this amendment, including looking at legislation where necessary. In practice, the Mann amendment would amount to little more than a nudge in the direction of the government having to agree to match any new EU measures strengthening workers\u2019 rights, and so the significance of this is limited. She restated her opposition to a second referendum - but also claimed that a majority of MPs were also opposed. And she implied that holding one could trigger disorder. She said: I fear a second referendum would set a difficult precedent that could have significant implications for how we handle referendums in this country - not least, strengthening the hand of those campaigning to break up our United Kingdom. It would require an extension of article 50. We would very likely have to return a new set of MEPs to the European Parliament in May. And I also believe that there has not yet been enough recognition of the way that a second referendum could damage social cohesion by undermining faith in our democracy ... I know there are members who have already indicated that they wish to test the support of the House for this path. I do not believe there is a majority for a second referendum. And if I am right, then just as the government is having to think again about its approach going forwards, then so too do those members who believe this is the answer. It is hard to be sure, but this sounded a bit like May saying she would be happy if an MP tabled an amendment forcing a vote on this next week, because she was reasonably confident it would be defeated. She claimed that the EU would not allow article 50 to be extended unless the UK had a plan for approving a deal - meaning the only way to avoid a no-deal Brexit would be to revoke article 50. And that would be unacceptable, because it would cancel Brexit, she said. She said the cross-party talks on Brexit were still ongoing. She said that she would provide a further update to MPs on Brexit at the start of the debate in the Commons on Tuesday next week. Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden asks if May is implacably opposed to holding a general election. May says she has made it clear she does not think an election is in the national interest \u201cat this time\u201d. Labour\u2019s Ben Bradshaw asks May if her first loyalty is to the national interest or the party interest. May says everything she is doing in the national interest. Anna Soubry, the Tory pro-European, says: \u201cThis just isn\u2019t good enough.\u201d May is turning the UK \u201cinto a laughing stock\u201d, she says. She says May promised before Christmas to sort out the backstop. \u201cThe truth is, nothing has changed.\u201d May says she did get fresh assurances from the EU over Christmas. But they did not go far enough, she says. Frank Field, the independent MP who is tabling an amendment calling for a series of indicative votes, asks May to back this proposal. May says she is still discussing Brexit with MPs. She says the motion being debated next week will be amendable. Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, asks May to rule out extending article 50. He says that would give certainty to business. May says she hopes she can reassure him, by saying the UK will be leaving on 29 March. But she does not firmly rule out extending article 50. May refused to firmly rule out extending article 50. Here is the full text of May\u2019s statement to MPs. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, says May\u2019s door may be open, but her mind is closed. She is ruling out rejecting no deal, and ruling out a customs union. He urges her to accept the plan in the committee\u2019s report (pdf) last week for MPs to get indicative votes. May says Benn is wrong to think that MPs can easily rule out a no-deal Brexit. The way to do that is to back a deal, she says. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, thanks May for the meetings she has held, and her recognition that changes to the backstop need to be made. Is May serious about getting changes through the Commons, with the necessary changes to the backstop? May says she wants to find the best way to resolve these issues that will command the support of MPs. Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary, asks May to confirm that she will seek legally binding changes to the text of the withdrawal agreement when she goes back to the EU. May says she is listening to what MPs propose on this. There are a number of options, she says. She will look to see what would command the support of the house. Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper challenges May to hold votes on her red lines, such as staying out of the customs union. May says there will be a debate next week, and MPs will be able to table amendments. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, says the MoD put 3,500 troops on standby for a no-deal Brexit at the end of last week. What would their rules of engagement be if they have to deal with disturbances? May says the plan would be to use these troops to replace others, for example on guard duty. Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, asks if May would implement a customs union if MPs voted for it. May says she wants to listen to MPs\u2019 views, but that it is also important to implement the referendum result. (May thinks staying in the customs union would not implement that, because the UK would not be able to strike its own trade deals.) May signals she remains opposed to keeping the UK in the customs union. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says May is still sticking to her pre-conditions. She should take a no-deal Brexit off the table, he says. Ken Clarke, the pro-Europe Tory, says there were probably more remainers voting against May last week than Brexiters. May is responding to Corbyn. She says he said \u2018no more phoney talks\u2019. But it would be nice to have some talks with him, she says. She says Corbyn wants to rule out a no-deal Brexit. But she wants to talk to MPs about what is needed to ensure there is a deal. She says the \u00a34.2bn being spent by the government is not all for a no-deal Brexit. Some of that needs to be spent if the UK is leaving with a deal, she says. Jeremy Corbyn is responding to May. He says May is still in denial about the extent of her defeat last week. He says her cross-party talks are a \u201csham\u201d. He welcomes the news that the proposed fee for EU nationals applying for settled status will be abolished. He says May is going back to the EU to get concessions on the Irish backstop. What is the difference between a concession and a legal assurance? He says May tried this before Christmas. \u201cThis really does feel like Groundhog Day.\u201d He says Philip Hammond, the chancellor, told business that a no-deal Brexit would be ruled out. But he is spending \u00a34bn preparing for it, Corbyn says. He asks May to confirm that, if the Commons passes an amendment ruling out no deal, she will honour that. He says Labour will set out plans for a customs union with the EU, a strong single market deal, and no race to the bottom on workers\u2019 rights. Labour will also back amendments ruling out a no-deal Brexit. And it will consider the case for a people\u2019s vote, he says. May says the government wants to accept the John Mann amendment guaranteeing workers\u2019 rights after Brexit. It will consider legislating for this. Turning to EU nationals, May says the government will not charge the proposed fee for EU nationals who apply for settled status so they can stay in the UK. It was to be \u00a365 for adults and \u00a332.50 for under-16s. May says \u00a365 fee for EU nationals applying for settled status to be abolished. May says she wants to harness the views of MPs about what they want to see in the agreement on the future UK-EU treaty. May says she wants MPs to have more say on future UK-EU trade deal. She says MPs think they have not been consulted enough. MPs have used humble addresses to get hold of government documents. She says, in future, minister will brief select committees in confidence so that what they say does not undermine the government\u2019s negotiating position. She says she wants to get more input from the devolved administrations, and from business. May says there are four other issues. On these, there could be some progress, she says. On the backstop, May says she will not reopen the Good Friday agreement. She says she wants to find out what MPs are demanding on the backstop. Then she will take that demand back to the EU, she says. May says she wants MPs to clarify what they want on the backstop. Second, says May, some MPs have argued for a second referendum. She says this would undermine trust in politics. Article 50 would have to be extended. And she says holding a second vote could undermine social cohesion. May says some MPs want to test support for this in the Commons. She says she does not think there will be support for it. May says she expects MPs to reject calls for a second referendum. May says six issues have come up. First, MPs are concerned about the UK leaving the EU with no deal. The right way to address this is by approving a deal, she says. The alternative would be revoking article 50, which would mean staying in. She says the other alternative would be to extend article 50. But this would not rule out no deal - only extend the decision point. And the EU would not agree to extend article 50 just to give the UK more time. So this option would involve cancelling Brexit, she says. May restates her opposition to extending article 50. Turning to Brexit, May says it was clear from last week\u2019s vote that the government\u2019s approach to Brexit had to change. \u201cAnd it has.\u201d She says she has had meetings with opposition leaders about Brexit, apart from with Jeremy Corbyn. She says she regrets Corbyn has not taken part in the talks. She hopes he will change his mind. Theresa May is making her statement now. She starts by condemning the car bomb attack in Derry at the weekend. She says MPs want to ensure we never go back to the violence of the past. This is from Craig Oliver, who used to be David Cameron\u2019s communications chief, commenting on what Donald Tusk said about claiming he would never need to hold the referendum he promised. (See 2.17pm.) Oliver is right to say that Cameron repeatedly said in 2015 that he would insist on there being a referendum if he was prime minister after the election, even if he was leading a coalition government. But it is not clear from what the BBC had said about their Donald Tusk interview when Tusk\u2019s conversation with Cameron on this is supposed to have happened. It could have been well before the 2015 campaign. Theresa May is about to make her Commons statement about what she will do next following the defeat of her Brexit plan last week. On the World at One Stephen Crabb, the Conservative former cabinet minister, said some of his Brexiter colleagues were being \u201cdeeply, deeply irresponsible\u201d because they were making people think a no-deal Brexit would be acceptable. When you go outside London, as I was at the weekend, you hear people in the street saying: \u2018We just need to leave without a deal, let\u2019s just get out without a deal\u2019. And I think we\u2019re in quite dangerous territory as a country where, certainly a chunk of my party, or a wing of my party, is fomenting that kind of opinion. It is deeply, deeply irresponsible. He also described the European Research Group, which represents Brexiter Tories, as \u201calmost a party within a party\u201d. He explained: They organise themselves extremely effectively. They have their own leadership. They say publicly they have their own whips. They whip their members to vote in a certain way. They have their own briefing material. They rely on their own social media networks. So they are a well-established group, almost a party within a party. This is from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. On settled status, abolishing the fee would be a win for Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter, on the basis of what he was saying about it this morning. (See 10.49am.) Here are some more excerpts from the BBC\u2019s \u2018Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil\u2019 documentary, the first episode of which goes out a week today. Donald Tusk, the European council president, recalls telling David Cameron that EU leaders did not want to offer radical change as part of his renegotiation. I told him bluntly come on David, get real. I know that all prime ministers are promising to help you, but believe me the truth is that no-one has an appetite for revolution in Europe only because of your stupid referendum. If you try to force us, to hurry us, you will lose everything. And for the first time I saw something close to fear in his eyes. He finally realised what a challenge he was facing. Tusk recalls Cameron calling him after the referendum result. David Cameron called me and he informed me that he\u2019s ready to resign. I said, \u2018Yes David, it would be very difficult even to imagine that a prime minister who was the leader of remain\u2019s campaign would be just two days later a prime minister negotiating Brexit.\u2019 It was like his day of reckoning was coming, reckoning for his biggest mistake in his life.\u201d William Hague, foreign secretary when Cameron promised a referendum, recalls arguing in favour. \u201cThis was coming. Either we had to lead that or be the victims of it,\u201d Hague tells the programme. But George Osborne, the then chancellor, urged Cameron not to make the promise, saying a referendum could be a \u201cdisaster for Britain\u201d. Francois Hollande, the former French president, recalls urging Cameron in September 2015 to break his manifesto promise to hold a referendum. He made the argument when staying overnight at Chequers, and he told the programme: Nothing obliged him to hold the referendum when he did. This would not be the first time that a commitment made at an election had not been kept afterwards, but he wanted to show he could negotiate successfully with Europeans. Donald Tusk, the European council president, has claimed that David Cameron told him he thought he would never have to hold the referendum he promised because the Lib Dems would block it. In an interview for a BBC documentary, \u2018Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil\u2019, the first episode of which goes out a week today, Tusk said: I asked David Cameron, \u2018Why did you decide on this referendum, this \u2013 it\u2019s so dangerous, so even stupid, you know,\u2019 and he told me \u2013 and I was really amazed and even shocked \u2013 that the only reason was his own party. [He told me] he felt really safe, because he thought at the same time that there\u2019s no risk of a referendum, because his coalition partner, the Liberals, would block this idea of a referendum. But then, surprisingly, he won and there was no coalition partner. So paradoxically David Cameron became the real victim of his own victory. A no-deal Brexit and a sharper slowdown in China are the biggest risks to growth in the global economy in 2019, the International Monetary Fund has warned in its latest economic outlook. Parliament is unlikely to have a second binding vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal until February, Downing Street has said, playing down the significance of the motion that will be voted on next week. Downing Street has refused to back business minister Richard Harrington\u2019s claim that a no-deal Brexit would be \u201can absolute disaster\u201d. (See 12.04pm.) Cross-party Brexit talks between the government and backbench MPs have resumed despite May\u2019s insistence that her first priority is to reach out to hardline Tory Brexiters and the Democratic Unionist party over the issue of the Northern Ireland backstop. Members of the EU27 have expressed their frustration with May while rejecting a game-changing renegotiation of the Irish backstop and calling for a convincing \u2018plan B\u2019 that could win round parliament to a Brexit deal. As Daniel Boffey reports, arriving in Brussels for a meeting on Monday, EU27 foreign ministers expressed varying degrees of openness to making changes to the withdrawal agreement, but were sceptical of being able to offer anywhere near enough for May to secure the support of rebel MPs. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has signalled that the EU would be willing to change the political declaration on the future UK-EU relationship to help May get her deal through parliament. In an interview with RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly, he appeared to rule out any changes to the backstop, saying the withdrawal agreement was the best deal possible. But he indicated that the EU was willing to be flexible on the political declaration. Connelly has summed up the interview in a Twitter thread starting here. And here are some of his tweets. The Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who is leading a backbench effort to rule out a no-deal Brexit, has argued that much of the government, including Theresa May, privately want this to happen, and are relying on parliament to take action. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leading Tory Brexiter, has strongly criticised the government plan to make EU nationals living in the UK pay \u00a365 for settled status giving them the right to remain. (See 10.49am.) Work has begun at the Calais Eurotunnel exit for a new border inspection post for horses and other large animals as part of a \u00a320m no-deal contingency plan. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has welcomed new sanctions imposed by the European Union on Russians blamed for the Novichok nerve agent attack in Salisbury. As the Press Association reports, Hunt said the decision to place travel bans and asset freezes on nine people delivered on the UK\u2019s pledge to take \u201ctough action against the reckless and irresponsible activities of the Russian military intelligence organisation\u201d. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, has said Fiona Bruce was \u201cclearly repeating Tory propaganda\u201d and rejected the BBC\u2019s apology after the Question Time host misstated Labour\u2019s position in the polls. Conservative Chief Whip Julian Smith must resign if he is privately blocking proposals to allow MPs on maternity leave to vote by proxy, Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson has said. As the Press Association reports, the Times reports that Smith is trying to \u201cobstruct\u201d a change in the voting system as he attempts to win support in the Commons for May\u2019s Brexit deal. Swinson said: Julian Smith had to apologise for cheating my constituents out of their voice, by asking an MP to break our pair while I nursed my two-week-old baby. If he is blocking proxy voting in private, it makes an absolute mockery of his public apology and he should resign. Downing Street says May supported introducing proxy voting in the Commons for MPs on maternity leave, but that it was important to make sure the change was introduced properly. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, has suggested that Labour may not commit itself to backing a second referendum on Brexit until the UK is \u201cabout to hit the wall of no deal\u201d. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire, she was asked about claims that Labour is delaying the moment when it has to back a second referendum for as long as possible. She replied: We are going through these different options as has been set out by our party policy. So we go for a general election. We are now at the stage of trying to look at all options that may be on the table, so we are trying to say to [Theresa May], \u2018Look you need to have a customs deal, we have to be part of a customs union, you have to stop blackmailing us on no deal. There are certain things you absolutely have to do.\u2019 We have been saying that. Then, if we end up where we are absolutely about to hit the wall of no deal, then of course we will try anything we can to make sure that we protect our country. Ireland\u2019s Europe minister, Helen McEntee, has ruled out bilateral talks on Brexit with the DUP and any other political party in the UK. She said the negotiations were between the European Union and the UK. Speaking on Morning Ireland about reports claiming the UK government is considering how a UK-Ireland treaty could resolve the backstop issue, she said: What we can\u2019t do and won\u2019t do, because we have not throughout this entire process, is engage in any kind of bilateral negotiations with the DUP or any other political party in the North or the UK. She also ruled out changing the Good Friday agreement, saying: It is not negotiable for us and I really doubt any parties in the south or north or those in the UK would agree to it. We have 94% of the people here who voted overwhelmingly to support the Good Friday agreement and it was over 70% in the north. To suggest that after only 20 years we would try to amend it or change it, it\u2019s not something that we would consider and not something I think the prime minister would consider. Everything we are hearing is speculation and until the prime minister actually brings forward her motion, all of this is speculation. George Osborne, the Conservative former chancellor, thinks Theresa May would rather have a no-deal Brexit than no Brexit. He now edits the Evening Standard, and, in an \u201ceditor\u2019s reply\u201d slot in the paper today, he says he thinks that would be May\u2019s preference because, when it comes to the crunch, she will put party first. He says: As it happens, however, I understand why [Jeremy] Corbyn doesn\u2019t want to enter talks with Theresa May. It\u2019s all been a short-lived Downing Street stunt. The prime minister all but confirmed that on the call to the cabinet last night that was leaked. She will never make the move needed to win over substantial cross-party support for a Brexit deal, because it would further rupture the Conservatives. I predict that when the crunch comes she\u2019ll put her party first, and that means she would favour a no-deal Brexit before no Brexit. Of course, parliament may well overrule her \u2014 as we\u2019ll see this week. Here is more from the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming on what the Polish foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowicz, has said about being willing to see the backstop limited to five years. (See 12.21pm.) And this is from the Polish Press Agency\u2019s Jakub Krupa. Earlier I quoted the ICM polling in today\u2019s Guardian suggesting that a no-deal Brexit is the most popular of various Brexit outcomes with the public. (See 9.15am.) The Labour MP Chris Bryant says he knows some people think a no-deal Brexit means staying in the EU. This Sky News Twitter poll seems to back that up. UPDATE: YouGov\u2019s Anthony Wells says, in its polls at least, people don\u2019t think a no-deal Brexit means staying in the EU. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg (here) and ITV\u2019s Robert Peston (here) have both written blogs trying to sum up the state of play at Westminster. They are both finding it hard to conceal a sense of despair about the process. Here is an extract from Kuenssberg\u2019s article. On the face of it, there is nothing remotely surprising about Theresa May telling her Cabinet colleagues last night that she wants to have another go at trying to sort out the backstop. The political implication of that is that she still thinks it is better at this stage for her to pursue a strategy that might just about conceivably see, in the end after a lot more wrangling, a version of her deal squeak through the House of Commons with support from her own MPs and having kissed and made up with the DUP. Right now that seems a long way off of course, and it might prove impossible. But the view at the top of government is that, on balance, this is the better choice. There are plenty of MPs and some in government on the other side of this argument who think it is not much short of insane to keep going with a strategy that has been so roundly kicked out by the Commons. You hear a lot of quoting of Einstein, who claimed the definition of insanity was doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. (Although as so often there is a row over whether he actually said that at all.) And here is an extract from Peston\u2019s. This new leg of potentially pointless process starts this afternoon, when the PM will spell out her revised route to a deal in the form of a motion, that will then be amended by backbenchers. There will then be votes on the amendments \u2013 the important ones probably having the effect of coercing the PM to endeavour to rule out a no-deal Brexit \u2013 on Tuesday week, 29 January. An acceleration of talks with the EU will follow, and another \u201cmeaningful\u201d (or potentially \u201cmeaningless\u201d) vote on a tweaked version of the PMs Brexit plan in mid February. By which point we will be a month from the due date for exiting the EU, and if parliament were to reject her deal we may be no nearer knowing how and even whether we are actually leaving the EU. \u201cThe world is laughing at us\u201d a minister said to me. \u201cAnd for some reason the PM doesn\u2019t seem bothered\u201d. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, has criticised the response of the BBC to the complaints made about how she was treated on Question Time last week. Work has begun at the Calais Eurotunnel exit for a new border inspection post for horses and other large animals as part of a \u00a320m no-deal contingency plan, my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports. These are from the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming and Katya Adler. I\u2019m just back from the Downing Street briefing. A good rule from lobby is that, the longer a briefing is, the less informative is. That\u2019s because reporters keep asking questions in the forlorn hope that they might actually learn something. Today\u2019s was a longish briefing, and not enormously enlightening, but there were some clues. No 10 is not ruling out Theresa May saying that the EU withdrawal agreement will have to be renegotiated. When the prime minister\u2019s spokesman was asked if he could rule out Theresa May saying this in her statement to MPs this afternoon, he said he did not want to pre-empt her statement. But he said it was clear to May from her cross-party talks on Brexit that a significant number of MPs have concerns about the backstop. (At this point some reporters suggested this was obvious some time ago.) The spokesman played down the significance of next Tuesday\u2019s debate and vote on what should happen next. The government is tabling a motion in neutral terms, and MPs are expected to table amendments. But the spokesman stressed that this would not be the second \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d - the vote on a motion approving a Brexit deal required under law for the withdrawal agreement to be ratified. The spokesman would not be drawn on when that vote might take place, but he hinted it might be after next Tuesday (29 January). He said that any votes on amendments on 29 January would allow the Commons to express its political will, but that they would not be legally binding. The spokesman said that cross-party talks on Brexit are still going on. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, is meeting groups of MPs today, including Labour MPs. And May\u2019s offer to meet Jeremy Corbyn is still open, the spokesman said. Downing Street refused to back business minister Richard Harrington\u2019s claim that a no-deal Brexit would be \u201can absolute disaster\u201d. (See 9.04am.) Asked about this, the spokesman said that the PM was trying to avoid a no-deal Brexit, that there would be \u201cdisruption\u201d if the UK did leave the EU without a deal, but that it was putting in place mitigations to reduce that disruption. The spokesman denied reports that the government was proposing to amend the Good Friday agreement as one solution to the backstop problem. And, asked if the government was interested in a bilateral treaty with Ireland as a solution, he said that was \u201cnot something we are looking at\u201d. This is from Peter Altmaier, Germany\u2019s economics minister. He seems to be suggesting that Theresa May is abusing EU patience, putting party politics ahead of the national interest. I\u2019m off to the Number 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am. There were some interesting lines in Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s LBC phone-in, beyond his surprise approval of a Guardian article. (See 9.15am.) Here are the main points. Rees-Mogg said he was strongly opposed to the government scheme requiring EU nationals living in the UK to pay \u00a365 for settled status to stay in the country. The scheme is now open. Asked about it, Rees-Mogg said that he was \u201cagainst it\u201d and that he agreed with people who felt this was not what Brexiters voted for. He explained: We are saying to people who\u2019ve been living her legally, who had had all the right papers to be here, that they must have a new paper for which they must pay. They should have it free in the same way as a birth certificate is free. I feel very strongly about this. I think the tone of the debate on EU nationals here has been very wrong. Any of our listeners, EU nationals that are living here, in my view we should be really honoured that they came to this country. They came here legally. They have contributed to our society. They were very hard. And very often they have send money back to their families at home. It\u2019s a conservative and noble thing to do. It\u2019s family-based, very often, it\u2019s hard-work based and it\u2019s entrepreneurial. And to say to them, because we\u2019ve changed our relationship with the European Union, that their lives should be changed is to my mind unfair. We should have said, in June 2016, that they could all stay ... and the \u00a365 charge should, in my view, be waived. It\u2019s unreasonable. He defended Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision not to participate in Theresa May\u2019s cross-party Brexit talks. He said: In defence of Jeremy Corbyn, the job of the opposition is to oppose, not to make the life of the government easy. And it is not unreasonable of him to say, \u2018Well, actually no, you\u2019re responsible, you won the election, if you don\u2019t want to to do it, if you want me to help you, I\u2019ll take over as prime minister, thank you very much.\u2019 So I think Theresa May was right to ask him. And he was not unreasonable to refuse - possibly politically naive to refuse, but not unreasonable. But Rees-Mogg also said Corbyn might have gained more politically by attending the talks, and then criticising May afterwards for being too dogmatic. He explained: The greatest political advantage for [Corbyn] would have been to go in for talks, and then come and say, \u2018This was a complete waste of time because ...\u2019 Whereas I think saying no, and setting the pre-condition, then makes Jeremy Corbyn looks inflexible and dogmatic and does not help his opposition. Ironically Rees-Mogg\u2019s argument is almost exactly the same as one made by Tony Blair in an interview in the Times (paywall) on Saturday. Talking about what Corbyn should have done, Blair said: Why wouldn\u2019t you go in the door, come out on the steps of Downing Street and say, \u2018I have had a conversation with her and I\u2019m afraid she doesn\u2019t understand how to resolve this and I do\u2019. Rees-Mogg said he thought a no-deal Brexit was now the most likely outcome. Asked what he expected to happen, he said: I think, if you were to rank them, the most likely is no deal. The second most likely is a redone deal. Third is delay. And fourth, a long way behind is not leaving at all. Asked about the chances of there being a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d, he said he saw that as a \u201closers\u2019 vote\u201d and thought the proposal had got \u201cremarkably little support\u201d. Rees-Mogg said he was still a fan of John Bercow, the speaker, despite Bercow deciding to reinterpret Commons rules two weeks ago in a way that angered Brexiters. Rees-Mogg explained: I think [Bercow] came to the wrong decision, but I don\u2019t think he came to the wrong decision for the wrong reason. I think he came to it for the right reason. Rees-Mogg said he would like to see the Conservative party reunite with parts of Ukip. Asked if Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, should be allowed to join the Conservative party, he said: If the Conservative party could reunite with the reasonable elements of Ukip that would be very good news and Nigel would be part of that. Rees-Mogg said that admitting Farage be \u201cmuch easier now than it would have been when he was still a member of Ukip\u201d, because of Ukip\u2019s new links with Tommy Robinson. He went on: It may be a little bit early, though personally I hold Nigel in the highest regard and think he was one of the people who was instrumental in delivering Brexit ... but perhaps a little bit more purdah is required. In Brussels, arriving for the EU foreign affairs council, the German foreign affairs minister Heiko Maas said EU ministers need to hear what the UK wants. He told reporters: We are all quite keen to see what we will hear from London today. It is about time. We know what London doesn\u2019t want, now we must at last find out what they want and what there is a majority in parliament for, so we can sit down with our colleagues from London and talk about how we avoid a hard Brexit, a Brexit without an agreement. It appears that everyone wants that, so it must be possible. Asked if he had confidence in Theresa May, Maas replied: \u201cOf course\u201d. But asked whether it was now \u201ctoo late\u201d, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t really know.\u201d He went on: It is important that the outcome is not a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, because as we saw this weekend, nerves are on edge there. Europe is a peace project and Europe cannot do anything which leads to conflicts breaking out again in a part of Europe where they have long since been laid to rest. It\u2019s a very sensitive issue and therefore it\u2019s an issue which in the discussions to come I cannot imagine there will be much change. The Today programme also had an interview with Sir Stephen Laws, who is now a senior research fellow at the Policy Exchange thinktank, but who until 2012 was the government\u2019s first parliamentary counsel (ie, the official in charge of drafting parliamentary legislation). He was asked about the Dominic Grieve proposal to change parliamentary rules to enable backbenchers to table legislation against the wishes of the executive. Laws said this could be very damaging because it could lead to the Queen being dragged into party politics. In a statement released by Policy Exchange Laws said: If the speaker chose to allow this rule to be dispensed with or ignored, that could have unpredictable, and potentially horrific, constitutional consequences. It could raise a question whether the government would be entitled or might feel required to reassert its constitutional veto by advising the Queen not to grant royal assent to the bill. How should the monarch react to such advice? The answer is not straightforward and the prospect of it needing to be considered in a real life political crisis is unthinkably awful. It is a sacred duty of all UK politicians not to involve the monarch in politics. They have a constitutional responsibility to resolve difficulties between themselves in accordance with the rules, and so as not to call on the ultimate referee. Laws has written more on this in this Policy Exchange briefing (pdf). Mairead McGuinness, a Fine Gael MEP and vice president of the European Parliament, told the Today programme this morning that replacing the backstop with a new treaty between the UK and Ireland was \u201cnot an option\u201d. Today\u2019s Daily Telegraph claims that this is being considered by Number 10, although Downing Street is playing down the report. Asked about it, McGuinness said: Ireland is part of the European Union so the idea that one country of the 27 would have this particular arrangement with the United Kingdom, separate from what the EU does, really is not an option - I was quite surprised when I read the speculation yesterday. There was a time in the past when there might have been, and indeed there was speculation ... that the United Kingdom expected one member state of the European Union perhaps to break ranks and therefore do bilateral deals and that has not happened and I don\u2019t think it will in this case. The Labour MP Yvette Cooper was on the Today programme this morning, talking about her bill which is designed to ensure that, if the Commons does not pass a Brexit deal by the end of February, the government would have to seek an extension of article 50 until the end of 2019. She claimed that May would secretly welcome what she was doing. Cooper said: I think [May] knows that she should rule out no deal in the national interest because it would be so damaging. She\u2019s refusing to do so and I think she\u2019s hoping that parliament will do this for her - that is not leadership. On LBC Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP and chair of the European Research Group, which is pushing for a harder Brexit, has just quoted the Guardian approvingly (perhaps a first). He cited some polling quoted in today\u2019s main Brexit story. A poll by ICM conducted after last week\u2019s government defeat and seen by the Guardian asked voters what should happen next. The most popular option, backed by 28% of voters, was a no-deal Brexit. Demonstrating the divide in public opinion, the next most popular option, supported by 24% of the public, is to start the process of holding a second referendum. In the representative online poll of 2,046 adults between 16\u201318 January, just 8% thought May should press ahead with trying to win support for her deal in parliament, while 11% thought she should call a general election. Rees-Mogg said that the idea of voters favour a no-deal Brexit might be alarming to the Guardian, but that to many people there was nothing odd about this at all. When LBC\u2019s Nick Ferrari put it to him that, outside London, people were far less worried about a no-deal Brexit than some Westminster politicians, Rees-Mogg agreed. Richard Harrington, the business minister, has already said he will resign from the government if Theresa May opts for a not-deal Brexit. Other ministers, including some in cabinet, think that same, but Harrington has been the most explicit about this. And this morning, in an interview on the Today programme, he went further. He said a no-deal Brexit (something May has refused to rule out, and something which Tory Brexiters insist would be manageable, if not ideal) would be \u201can absolute disaster\u201d. Asked what he thought about the prospect, he said: You said, \u201cDoes [the prospect of no deal] bring shivers?\u201d It does bring more than shivers, because I have examined in depth what might happen, I\u2019m part of the government\u2019s plans for Brexit. I\u2019ve seen what may well happen with this cut-off date. Crashing out in my view ... is an absolute disaster. It\u2019s not a road to a free trade agreement, it\u2019s not a road to anything. It\u2019s an absolute disaster for the country and it\u2019s supported by a minority of a minority of people. Harrington said he was not just worried about the tariffs that would be in place in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He was worried about the impact of friction at the border, particularly on the car industry, which is dependent on just-in-time supply chains. He said he was \u201cafraid\u201d of Jaguar and Mini closing in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Claiming that the UK would be able to manage trading with the EU on WTO terms was \u201cfanciful nonsense\u201d, he said. And he ended the interview saying: It says on my business card \u201cminister for business and industry\u201d. I\u2019m not prepared to sell business down the river for other people\u2019s political dogma. All of which is just a roundabout way of illustrating how, six days after Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal was voted down by a record majority of 230, the government is as split as ever about what should happen next. May has to come to the Commons this afternoon to say what she will do next. As the Guardian overnight story reports, she is expected to reject calls to forge a cross-party consensus on Brexit, choosing instead to back new diplomatic efforts in Brussels to renegotiate the Irish backstop. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative Brexiter who chairs the European Research Group, hosts his LBC phone-in. 9am: Damian Hinds, the education secretary, gives a speech to the Education World Forum. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. After 3.30pm: Theresa May gives her statement to MPs about what she will do next following the defeat of her Brexit plan in the Commons last week. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another after the May statement is over, at around 6pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "In 1959, Hugh Lewin, who has died aged 79, joined the South African Liberal party: shortly afterwards it became the only legal non-racial political party in the country, with the banning in 1960 of Nelson Mandela\u2019s African National Congress. Frustrated at the ruthless police state repression, Hugh joined the clandestine African Resistance Movement and embarked on a sabotage campaign, targeting government installations such as electricity pylons. ARM members were soon arrested after the police discovered its entire cell structure and its plans at the Cape Town flat of the national organiser, Adrian Leftwich, also a prominent Liberal. Best man at Hugh\u2019s wedding, Leftwich turned state witness to convict him at his 1964 trial, as did his close friend and co-conspirator John Lloyd. Hugh told the judge: \u201cI was terrified. Instinctively I was opposed to any form of violence and I knew that I was not suitable for the active role I was being asked to play \u2026 [but] I thought that sabotage might shock the whites into an awareness of the conditions under which blacks were living and, in due time, change the system.

But Hugh\u2019s spirit remained undaunted. He kept a secret diary, writing between the lines of his Bible in minute, almost-invisible pencil. Denis Goldberg, sentenced to life imprisonment at the Rivonia trial, remembers: \u201cHe sang beautifully in his baritone voice to entertain our prisoner group and was a great actor in our Christmas concerts, singing revolutionary songs with communist tenor Eli Weinberg. The red flag and the Internationale were as much part of his repertoire as liberal songs out of the US Christian movement.

      "body": "<p>It is a weird time to be make your living as a pop star. It is almost impossible to buy a new album on an average British high street, yet at every Boots in the country you can buy fragrances from Shawn Mendes, Little Mix, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Nicki Minaj, <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/music/ariana-grande\">Ariana Grande</a>, as well as Cristiano Ronaldo and Sarah Jessica Parker.</p> <p>Celebrity fragrance has long been an easy way to squeeze extra cash from fans, but according to the latest figures, it could be falling out of fashion. Fashion forecaster Euromonitor International has predicted just a 3% annual growth rate between 2017 and 2022 for fragrances \u2013 meaning the market is set to lag behind that of both cosmetics and skincare.</p> <p>However, in the last few years, celebrity makeup, clothing and other luxury lines have moved from a side hustle into a multi-billion-dollar industry that can generate fortunes for the famous that far surpass the money they make for doing the thing they\u2019re famous for. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f7b43c14b1cd2a44c3827f331d2257d37264267\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f7b43c14b1cd2a44c3827f331d2257d37264267/0_211_6000_3601/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drake\u2019s OVO store opening in Canada.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Drake\u2019s OVO store opening in Canada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Madonik/Toronto Star via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rihanna now makes more money from her Fenty Beauty makeup line than she does from music \u2013 the company turned <a href=\"http://www.papermag.com/rihanna-fenty-beauty-worth-2565592886.html\">over $100 million in its first 40 days trading</a>. By comparison, in the whole of 2016, the last year she had a record out, she earned $7.6m from streaming and $2.5m from music sales. Drake is expected to make a $50m revenue this year from his OVO clothing brand, which opened a bricks-and-mortar shop in London\u2019s Soho earlier last year. That\u2019s $3m more than Forbes <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/drake/#5a1f0f712856\">estimated he made from all his ventures</a> over the previous year, despite being the most streamed artist in the world.</p> <p>Cassandra Napoli, associate editor of digital media &amp; marketing at fashion trend agency WGSN, says there is more to these lines than just putting your name to a product. \u201cWhat\u2019s new is celebrities creating brands that are relevant now, that tie into this cultural moment. With Rihanna, it\u2019s about inclusivity and diversity, which has long been a topic on the runways for the past couple of years. When she launched her first foundation it came in 40 shades.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0abf0dddd1e90296af2ba9cbd088d36c1210e020\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0abf0dddd1e90296af2ba9cbd088d36c1210e020/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rihanna at a Fenty Beauty anniversary in Australia last autumn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rihanna at a Fenty Beauty anniversary in Australia last autumn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caroline McCredie/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That is not to say that some people aren\u2019t making a fortune even without cultural relevance. Britney Spears, who has not had a top 10 track since 2013, continues to sell millions of perfumes each year. She launched her first fragrance, Curious, in 2004. Thought at the time to be little more than an extension of her merchandising arm, Curious ended up being the top-selling fragrance of that year, netting more than $100 million. In 2017 it was estimated Spears has created $4.8bn in revenue from her perfumes \u2013 far more than she could ever hope to make from her music.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5e925a60ab09afde70ef57778aa6e6911605093f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e925a60ab09afde70ef57778aa6e6911605093f/0_161_2089_2983/700.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Levine at his fragrance launch in New York, February 2013\" width=\"700\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Levine at his fragrance launch in New York, February 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kristina Bumphrey/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7179b7d51e19a4e1d8544e7b9c91c54b30f878d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7179b7d51e19a4e1d8544e7b9c91c54b30f878d8/0_0_1901_3000/634.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Moss showcases her Rimmel range in London 2016\" width=\"634\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Moss showcases her Rimmel range in London 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Bennett/Getty Images for Rimmel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"69c5804a5156e3abe72a88f1ab76ccba7b77576e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69c5804a5156e3abe72a88f1ab76ccba7b77576e/3_79_2092_3028/691.jpg\" alt=\"Kylie Jenner promotes a Lip Kit in LA in 2015\" width=\"691\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kylie Jenner promotes a Lip Kit in LA in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One person closer to home who is as successful for her side hustles as for her role in reality TV is former Made in Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh. Her first foray into fashion was her eponymous label, which became <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/millie-mackintosh-i-have-ups-and-downs--but-i-dont-carry-anger/\">Asos\u2019s bestselling line after its in-house brands</a>. Since leaving the programme in 2013, Mackintosh also launched a range of eyelashes, a venture that led to a full beauty range, sold exclusively through Boots.</p> <p>Her second collection launched in September. I asked Mackintosh what the difference is between a range like Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty, which has been widely praised and, say, Katy Perry\u2019s fragrances, which feel inherently naff.</p> <p>\u201cUltimately it\u2019s how authentic it feels,\u201d she says. Mackintosh\u2019s own makeup artist, Sarah Reygate, insists Mackintosh\u2019s collection is good quality stuff; she even uses it on her other clients, she says. (When challenged to show me her makeup bag, sure enough, among the Clinique and the Mac products, was the Millie Mackintosh lip-colour balm.)</p> <p>Mackintosh\u2019s fashion line, however, folded earlier this year,<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-43382736\"> with Mackintosh citing \u201cthe financial climate\u201d</a> as the reason for its closure at the time. Creditors, and Mackintosh herself, lost hundreds of thousands of pounds.</p> <p>This time around she doesn\u2019t own the company \u2013 it\u2019s a deal with SLG, a makeup company that has a wide range of licensing deals with celebrities and other brands. \u201cI can sit back and enjoy and do the parts of it I really want to be involved in \u2013 the design, the promotion and the creative \u2013 that\u2019s where I\u2019m comfortable, not the numbers,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Would a celebrity\u2019s endorsement of a product ever sway the opinion of the Guardian\u2019s beauty columnist Sali Hughes? \u201cNo, definitely not, because I know how it works. The only time it would ever influence me is if it was with an expert in that field, so when the makeup artist, Pat McGrath, launched her beauty range, I was interested because I know her standards are high\u2026 but, in general, celebrity involvement is minimal; they probably see five products and then pick one.\u201d<strong><br><br></strong>She says that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all celebrity products are necessarily bad. \u201cKate Moss is a good example: her line of lipsticks for Rimmel are just really good.\u201d</p> <p>The Moss range is technically a partnership; the celebrity lends their name to a brand, without actually owning it. With those deals, the celebrity often gets paid a lump sum and sometimes a percentage of sales, to put their name to a product, but they won\u2019t be exposed to any financial risk. Napoli gives the example of American brand Nordstrom\u2019s three-year deal with Instagram influencer Arielle Charnas\u2019s brand Something Navy: were it to not meet expectations, Nordstrom have taken on all the risk.</p> <p>These low-risk deals have become attractive to even the most cynical celebrities. In 2011, <a href=\"http://stylecaster.com/adam-levine-peoples-sexiest-man-alive-2013/\">Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine</a> tweeted: \u201cI would like to put an official ban on celebrity fragrances. Punishable by death from this point forward.\u201d Fast forward seven years and Levine has a range of fragrances \u2013 he says he wants to \u201ccompete with Dior\u201d \u2013 as well as a fashion line in partnership with US clothing store Kmart.</p> <p>And then there are the celebrities who do own their own brands, such as 21-year-old Kylie Jenner, who three years ago was little more than the fourth or fifth most famous member of the Kardashian dynasty. Now she is on track to become the US\u2019s \u201cyoungest self-made billionaire, according to Forbes.</p> <p>Jenner appeared on the cover of Forbes magazine after her personal fortune increased by about $900 million in the space of a couple of years, largely thanks to a cosmetics line with her name on it. Kylie Cosmetics by Kylie Jenner began three years ago as Kylie Lip Kits, selling multipacks of lipstick and lip liner. The initial run of 15,000, sold directly through Jenner\u2019s website, sold out in one minute.</p> <p>Napoli gives an example of how Jenner combines her enormous influence over impressionable fans with the mechanics of Instagram-era retail to turn huge profits. \u201cShe subscribes to the drop model, so instead of doing a big product launch with months of lead-up, she\u2019ll take over a San Francisco space, announce a pop-up shop on Instagram and get people to line up around the block. It gets people excited.\u201d</p> <p>There are some brands where the celebrity in question has the majority stake in a private limited company, such as Alexa Chung, Victoria Beckham and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen\u2019s fashion lines (although in some cases there also high profile investors).

      "bodyText": "It is a weird time to be make your living as a pop star. It is almost impossible to buy a new album on an average British high street, yet at every Boots in the country you can buy fragrances from Shawn Mendes, Little Mix, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Nicki Minaj, Ariana Grande, as well as Cristiano Ronaldo and Sarah Jessica Parker. Celebrity fragrance has long been an easy way to squeeze extra cash from fans, but according to the latest figures, it could be falling out of fashion. Fashion forecaster Euromonitor International has predicted just a 3% annual growth rate between 2017 and 2022 for fragrances \u2013 meaning the market is set to lag behind that of both cosmetics and skincare. However, in the last few years, celebrity makeup, clothing and other luxury lines have moved from a side hustle into a multi-billion-dollar industry that can generate fortunes for the famous that far surpass the money they make for doing the thing they\u2019re famous for. Rihanna now makes more money from her Fenty Beauty makeup line than she does from music \u2013 the company turned over $100 million in its first 40 days trading. By comparison, in the whole of 2016, the last year she had a record out, she earned $7.6m from streaming and $2.5m from music sales. Drake is expected to make a $50m revenue this year from his OVO clothing brand, which opened a bricks-and-mortar shop in London\u2019s Soho earlier last year. That\u2019s $3m more than Forbes estimated he made from all his ventures over the previous year, despite being the most streamed artist in the world. Cassandra Napoli, associate editor of digital media &amp; marketing at fashion trend agency WGSN, says there is more to these lines than just putting your name to a product. \u201cWhat\u2019s new is celebrities creating brands that are relevant now, that tie into this cultural moment. With Rihanna, it\u2019s about inclusivity and diversity, which has long been a topic on the runways for the past couple of years. When she launched her first foundation it came in 40 shades.\u201d That is not to say that some people aren\u2019t making a fortune even without cultural relevance. Britney Spears, who has not had a top 10 track since 2013, continues to sell millions of perfumes each year. She launched her first fragrance, Curious, in 2004. Thought at the time to be little more than an extension of her merchandising arm, Curious ended up being the top-selling fragrance of that year, netting more than $100 million. In 2017 it was estimated Spears has created $4.8bn in revenue from her perfumes \u2013 far more than she could ever hope to make from her music. One person closer to home who is as successful for her side hustles as for her role in reality TV is former Made in Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh. Her first foray into fashion was her eponymous label, which became Asos\u2019s bestselling line after its in-house brands. Since leaving the programme in 2013, Mackintosh also launched a range of eyelashes, a venture that led to a full beauty range, sold exclusively through Boots. Her second collection launched in September. I asked Mackintosh what the difference is between a range like Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty, which has been widely praised and, say, Katy Perry\u2019s fragrances, which feel inherently naff. \u201cUltimately it\u2019s how authentic it feels,\u201d she says. Mackintosh\u2019s own makeup artist, Sarah Reygate, insists Mackintosh\u2019s collection is good quality stuff; she even uses it on her other clients, she says. (When challenged to show me her makeup bag, sure enough, among the Clinique and the Mac products, was the Millie Mackintosh lip-colour balm.) Mackintosh\u2019s fashion line, however, folded earlier this year, with Mackintosh citing \u201cthe financial climate\u201d as the reason for its closure at the time. Creditors, and Mackintosh herself, lost hundreds of thousands of pounds. This time around she doesn\u2019t own the company \u2013 it\u2019s a deal with SLG, a makeup company that has a wide range of licensing deals with celebrities and other brands. \u201cI can sit back and enjoy and do the parts of it I really want to be involved in \u2013 the design, the promotion and the creative \u2013 that\u2019s where I\u2019m comfortable, not the numbers,\u201d she says. Would a celebrity\u2019s endorsement of a product ever sway the opinion of the Guardian\u2019s beauty columnist Sali Hughes? \u201cNo, definitely not, because I know how it works. The only time it would ever influence me is if it was with an expert in that field, so when the makeup artist, Pat McGrath, launched her beauty range, I was interested because I know her standards are high\u2026 but, in general, celebrity involvement is minimal; they probably see five products and then pick one.\u201d She says that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all celebrity products are necessarily bad. \u201cKate Moss is a good example: her line of lipsticks for Rimmel are just really good.\u201d The Moss range is technically a partnership; the celebrity lends their name to a brand, without actually owning it. With those deals, the celebrity often gets paid a lump sum and sometimes a percentage of sales, to put their name to a product, but they won\u2019t be exposed to any financial risk. Napoli gives the example of American brand Nordstrom\u2019s three-year deal with Instagram influencer Arielle Charnas\u2019s brand Something Navy: were it to not meet expectations, Nordstrom have taken on all the risk. These low-risk deals have become attractive to even the most cynical celebrities. In 2011, Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine tweeted: \u201cI would like to put an official ban on celebrity fragrances. Punishable by death from this point forward.\u201d Fast forward seven years and Levine has a range of fragrances \u2013 he says he wants to \u201ccompete with Dior\u201d \u2013 as well as a fashion line in partnership with US clothing store Kmart. And then there are the celebrities who do own their own brands, such as 21-year-old Kylie Jenner, who three years ago was little more than the fourth or fifth most famous member of the Kardashian dynasty. Now she is on track to become the US\u2019s \u201cyoungest self-made billionaire, according to Forbes. Jenner appeared on the cover of Forbes magazine after her personal fortune increased by about $900 million in the space of a couple of years, largely thanks to a cosmetics line with her name on it. Kylie Cosmetics by Kylie Jenner began three years ago as Kylie Lip Kits, selling multipacks of lipstick and lip liner. The initial run of 15,000, sold directly through Jenner\u2019s website, sold out in one minute. Napoli gives an example of how Jenner combines her enormous influence over impressionable fans with the mechanics of Instagram-era retail to turn huge profits. \u201cShe subscribes to the drop model, so instead of doing a big product launch with months of lead-up, she\u2019ll take over a San Francisco space, announce a pop-up shop on Instagram and get people to line up around the block. It gets people excited.\u201d There are some brands where the celebrity in question has the majority stake in a private limited company, such as Alexa Chung, Victoria Beckham and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen\u2019s fashion lines (although in some cases there also high profile investors). In the fashion world, these brands have been taken the most seriously \u2013 in part because, with personal fortune on the line, the designs tend to be more considered. That all of these deals boil down to money and name, brings up the awkward question of privilege. Forbes\u2019 \u201cself-made\u201d descriptor drew significant criticism : \u201cIt is not shade to point out that Kylie Jenner isn\u2019t self-made. She grew up in a wealthy, famous family,\u201d tweeted Roxane Gay. \u201cHer success is commendable but it comes by virtue of her privilege.\u201d Even the dictionary got involved, with dictionary.com sarcastically tweeting \u201cSelf-made means having succeeded in life unaided.\u201d Mackintosh does not come from a Kardashian-style dynasty \u2013 the depictions of her as a \u201cQuality Street heiress\u201d slightly miss the mark, she points out, given the business was sold long before she was born \u2013 but, of course, you only get cast on a show like Made in Chelsea if you come form a certain background. With brands such as Rimmel, Benefit, Barry M, Bourjois and others offering makeup kits at a similar price and also available at Boots, the success of her line may lie in \u201cthe Mackintosh appeal\u201d. Do people buy her products because they want to look like her? \u201cYeah, there is that aspect to it,\u201d she says. And, really, that strikes at the central offering of any celebrity line. Take the Kardashians: having redefined the ideals of beauty in their own image, preferencing heavy contouring, lip fillers and plastic surgery \u2013 as Amy Schumer once put it, they take the faces they were born with as a light suggestion\u2013 they are now selling the look back to the general public. But, according to Mackintosh, is not as simple as just whacking your name on a product and hoping for the best. \u201cThe ultimate test is the customer \u2026\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it doesn\u2019t do so well, it\u2019s when it doesn\u2019t feel authentic or the product is just not good and the customer can see through that.\u201d Still, when you see Mackintosh\u2019s range on the \u201c3 for 2\u201d section of the Boots website, alongside Little Mix Face Gems and the \u201cZoella Lifestyle Hot Chocolate Fragranced Candle\u201d it does feel as though some celebrities are hoping that, with the right business model, a pre-existing fanbase and a knack for staying on the right side of Gen Z, they can reap rewards.

The club is now working on its own plans to transform the stadium and the land around it. There had been fears that Millwall would be forced out of Bermondsey by Lewisham\u2019s attempt to compulsory purchase land around The Den. After a lengthy battle the council finally abandoned those plans under huge public pressure, although the threat remained that the process could be reignited to force the development through. However, the Guardian understands that under the new Labour mayor of Lewisham, Damien Egan, club and council have enjoyed increasingly productive discussions. Such a rapprochement had seemed impossible under the previous regime, which insisted the \u00a32bn regeneration of \u201cNew Bermondsey\u201d could proceed only with the hugely divisive CPO and seemed set on selling the land at an undisclosed price to an offshore-registered developer called Renewal, owned by a previous senior officer of Lewisham council. Under Egan\u2019s leadership the council has shown a renewed will to accommodate its only professional league club and protect the work of the club\u2019s successful community trust. Plans are at an early stage but under a proposed new arrangement Millwall would retain the land while also putting forward its own plans to transform the stadium footprint. Should an agreement be reached to accommodate the needs of club, developer and council, it will represent an astonishing turnaround to a saga that has been played out across high court hearings, newspaper revelations, a libel case and toxic social media exchanges between Lewisham councillors and members of the public. Last week Egan made a rare public appearance at The Den on a matchday, greeting fans outside the ground in the company of club officials, a situation that would have been unthinkable during the rancorous final days of the previous mayor, Steve Bullock, and his deputy, Alan Smith. Egan told the Guardian: \u201cI am very grateful to Millwall FC and Renewal for joining me in what have been constructive and productive meetings over the past six months.

Debenhams closed 50 shops, Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld went into administration, and more retail space was lost than in any year since 2008, with 1.9m sq metres closing, according to the property analysts EG. But one retailer beat this trend, reporting profits of \u00a340m in the final six months of the year. In 2017, the same company was the publicly traded British stock that outperformed every other: Games Workshop, a high-street retailer of science fiction and fantasy miniatures, now carries a market capitalisation of more than \u00a31bn.</p> <p>But how did a company founded 40 years ago with one shop in Hammersmith, west London, become so successful? The answer lies in Warhammer 40,000 \u2013 40k, as it is usually known; a sprawling tabletop conflict game in which two players fight with collectible armies, including the space marines of the fascist human Imperium and the ancient fallen angels of the Eldar, using rules found in a library of 30 or so source books.</p> <p>If this sounds surprising, it is worth noting that Games Workshop isn\u2019t the only part of nerd culture to experience a recent rush of interest.

In fact, Warhammer Fantasy Battle, a goblins-and-gnomes war game, and Warhammer 40k are ridiculous, over-the-top pastiches, created by people who were bored and angry under Margaret Thatcher, and channelled that rage into worlds where everyone is the villain, and hope has been extinguished for millennia.</p> <p>Each game exists in its own vast fictional universe, with the entire thing loosely connected by a narrative about the forces of chaos and a fondness for skulls. \u201cImagine if Disney were founded by a bunch of people who had been primarily inspired by heavy metal album covers,\u201d says the writer Kieron Gillen, a longtime fan who has written tie-in comics for the company. \u201cThere\u2019s a belief that less is more, but what Games Workshop argues, quite convincingly, is that, no, maybe more is more.</p> <p>\u201cA fundamental 40k thrill is probably something involving a chainsword, which is a sword crossed with a chainsaw. That is over-the-top and silly, but also, in a very heavy-metal-guitar-solo way, exciting.\u201d</p> <p>It certainly was for me. By the time I was a child, growing up around the corner from that first shop, Warhammer was already something of a phenomenon among the sort of crowd who carried 20-sided dice in their schoolbags. Tucked in the back of that small store was a vast diorama depicting an entire chapter of Ultramarines, the 9ft tall, blue-armoured shock troops of the human Imperium of the 41st millennium. The display \u2013 more than 1,000 small figurines, replete with miniature tanks, standard bearers and a detachment of motorcyclists \u2013 was my personal crown jewels: dripping with symbolism; a must-see for visitors to my area, and just as unattainable.</p> <p>That\u2019s because the second thing to know about Games Workshop is, as Gillen says, that Warhammer was what middle-class nerds did instead of heroin. It was just as expensive, and probably no better for your social life. A small squadron of space marines would cost about \u00a320, a fortune for a 12-year-old; but a full two-player game would need almost 10 times that many units, as well as tanks, bikes and special figures \u2013 not to mention huge bipedal dreadnoughts.</p> <p>I finally managed to save up for a tiny army from the Necron faction, a race of mechanical skeletons who flay their foes with a glowing green \u201cgauss gun\u201d. Painting, playing with, and (when I could afford it) buying those models was my life for a few years \u2013 until an inexpertly mounted shelf collapsed, smashing the whole army.</p> <p>But for those fans whose dream wasn\u2019t so literally crushed, Warhammer isn\u2019t a game, it\u2019s a hobby. The Hobby. It\u2019s as much about assembling and painting the models themselves, using the special paints, inks and washes created by Games Workshop. It\u2019s about sharing your finished miniatures and reading White Dwarf, Games Workshop\u2019s in-house magazine. (This magazine is also the only way the company communicates with the outside world; it is notoriously press-shy, and would not be interviewed for this article.) It\u2019s about the Black Library, a collection of tie-in fiction that runs to hundreds of novels, as well as comics, video games and a new young-adult book series.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a2b74b2e8cf33268bf2fe664dffe3060612f4fa4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2b74b2e8cf33268bf2fe664dffe3060612f4fa4/0_15_920_920/500.jpg\" alt=\"A Warhammer character.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This depth means that former fans never quite leave. Duncan, a childhood fan who returned to the game as an adult, agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of everything. There\u2019s an easy escapism in reading the fiction, especially now you can do it on a Kindle, and not advertise what you\u2019re reading to other commuters. The games themselves are fun and very social.</p> <p>\u201cBut I also like the modelling and painting. I used, as a teenager, to play with unpainted models, but nowadays I enjoy the process [of painting]. It\u2019s oddly relaxing; more like meditation than a chore.\u201d</p> <p>At its worst, that fanatical dedication has made followers easy prey for a company eager to line its pockets. But Gillen, whose latest book, Die, is loosely inspired by his own experience playing the Warhammer role-playing game in his teens, says things have changed.</p> <p>\u201cI used to write these guides on <a href=\"http://hipsterhammer.tumblr.com/post/116654848706/restate-my-assumptions\" title=\"\">how to make a Warhammer army for \u00a360</a>,\u201d he says. \u201cI stopped doing that, partly because I don\u2019t need to. Now, you can buy one of the official \u00a350 boxes and you have an army.\u201d</p> <p>For Gillen, the story of Games Workshop\u2019s renaissance isn\u2019t a story of sweeping reorganisation but a myriad of small changes that have turned a slightly fusty, vaguely mistrusted brand into one that is gaining new players, reconnecting with older ones and profiting \u2013 handsomely \u2013 from both.</p> <p>Which doesn\u2019t mean there haven\u2019t been large changes. In 2015, the company abruptly discontinued its oldest game, Warhammer Fantasy Battle \u2013 even publishing in-game fiction that destroyed the world. The replacement, Age of Sigmar, was built to be accessible to new players, with simpler rules. It caused uproar among existing players who claimed the whole thing was dumbed down to the point of stupidity. But three years on, with most of the best changes incorporated into a new edition of Warhammer 40k, it is clear the rewrite paid off.</p> <p>Anita Widdowson, 20, a student in Nottingham, is one of those newer players. She started collecting the models about two years ago, but only got round to learning to play last year, and credits the new rules with bringing more players on.</p> <p>\u201cThe \u2018Eighth Edition rules\u2019 are much simpler than any previous edition,\u201d she says. \u201cIt means that casual players and younger children can follow the game well, enticing more customers.\u201d But, like Gillen, Widdowson says there are many reasons for the boom overall: better models, easier construction and the way Games Workshop communicates with the community through its magazine, rather than simply offering them a catalogue to buy things from.</p> <p>The shops themselves have had a cosmetic overhaul (some stores were rebranded to read simply Warhammer, as the chain tried to consolidate its image), but Games Workshop has also put a huge amount of effort into building a welcoming atmosphere. \u201cYou know that old reputation of their shops being alienating?

      "bodyText": "Last year saw a bloodbath on the high street. Debenhams closed 50 shops, Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld went into administration, and more retail space was lost than in any year since 2008, with 1.9m sq metres closing, according to the property analysts EG. But one retailer beat this trend, reporting profits of \u00a340m in the final six months of the year. In 2017, the same company was the publicly traded British stock that outperformed every other: Games Workshop, a high-street retailer of science fiction and fantasy miniatures, now carries a market capitalisation of more than \u00a31bn. But how did a company founded 40 years ago with one shop in Hammersmith, west London, become so successful? The answer lies in Warhammer 40,000 \u2013 40k, as it is usually known; a sprawling tabletop conflict game in which two players fight with collectible armies, including the space marines of the fascist human Imperium and the ancient fallen angels of the Eldar, using rules found in a library of 30 or so source books. If this sounds surprising, it is worth noting that Games Workshop isn\u2019t the only part of nerd culture to experience a recent rush of interest. Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the venerable role-playing game, has had its own resurgence since 2014, thanks to depictions in TV shows such as Community and Stranger Things. The rise in \u201cactual play\u201d podcasts such as the Adventure Zone and Critical Role has also helped, as has a focus on attracting new players for its fifth edition. Tabletop gaming in general is doing better than ever. On Kickstarter, which has taken an influential role in the industry, the category was up 20% in 2018 year on year, raising a total of $165m (\u00a3128m). Asmodee, a global board-game publisher based in France, was sold to a private equity firm in July for \u20ac1.2bn (\u00a31.1bn). But Warhammer\u2019s success stands out, and to understand why this is, there are a few things you need to know.

After working in accounts for a window manufacturer, and then for Britten-Norman, a light aircraft company, on the Isle of Wight, Pete joined the Greater London council, by now commuting from Liphook. In the 1980s, with the writing on the wall for the GLC, Pete moved into information governance for Waverley borough council in Surrey. Later he trained staff in this field for the NHS and the Ambulance Service. Pete had first learned to sail at school and he and Jeanette bought their first boat in the 70s, mooring it on the south coast in Portsmouth. When they retired four years ago, they moved back to the Isle of Wight to a house overlooking a marina. They had several different boats, sailing to the Channel Islands and France. Pete always had music playing \u2013 his tastes ranged from classical to pop. He had a special love of Bob Dylan and aspired to be a guitarist. A very positive person, he never complained when he became ill and was grateful to the staff at St Mary\u2019s hospital, Newport, for their care. Pete is survived by Jeanette, their children, Elizabeth and Neil, and four grandchildren, Phoebe, Tom, Rebecca and Lucy, and by me.",

That would not be enough, as I discovered when I had to persuade my 90-year-old father to stop driving. Having had two successful cataract operations he would have passed any eye test, but his nearly new car had already acquired dents and scratches. Much more important were his slow reactions. This was exemplified by a glass falling out of a kitchen cupboard and smashing to pieces on the floor, which he didn\u2019t even notice. We couldn\u2019t risk him running into someone else, least of all a small child. Now fast approaching 70, my own reactions aren\u2019t what they were and hope I shall voluntarily stop driving in time. <br><strong>Alan Weeks</strong><br><em>Wincle, </em><em>Cheshire </em></p> <p>\u2022 Although individual cases must not be used to set policy, the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s accident has raised the issue of safety when older people continue to drive much more than other recent incidents. With aging comes deterioration in vision, concentration, coordination, memory, dexterity and other functions essential to safe driving but they start at varying ages and progress at different rates. A cut-off at any specific age will disadvantage many people unnecessarily.</p> <p>The present system of renewal from 70 is not working. There need to be clearer guidelines and, in many situations, objective tests. For example many countries require eyesight testing for licence renewal.</p> <p>There is also pressure on doctors to sign these forms because a car is often essential to avoid becoming housebound. The system needs the ability for independent assessment, though not necessarily at 70. There also needs to be a restoration and improvement in public transport so that older people who are unsafe, or choose not to drive, can continue to shop, visit friends, and participate in community activities. <br><strong>Michael Peel</strong><br><em>Axbridge, Somerset</em></p> <p>\u2022 Have photographs of Prince Philip driving Land Rovers now superseded pictures of Theresa May going to church (Letters, passim)?<br><strong>Toby Wood</strong><br><em>Peterborough, Cambridgeshire </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here to upload it</em></strong></a><strong><em> and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

This was exemplified by a glass falling out of a kitchen cupboard and smashing to pieces on the floor, which he didn\u2019t even notice. We couldn\u2019t risk him running into someone else, least of all a small child. Now fast approaching 70, my own reactions aren\u2019t what they were and hope I shall voluntarily stop driving in time. Alan Weeks Wincle, Cheshire \u2022 Although individual cases must not be used to set policy, the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s accident has raised the issue of safety when older people continue to drive much more than other recent incidents. With aging comes deterioration in vision, concentration, coordination, memory, dexterity and other functions essential to safe driving but they start at varying ages and progress at different rates. A cut-off at any specific age will disadvantage many people unnecessarily. The present system of renewal from 70 is not working. There need to be clearer guidelines and, in many situations, objective tests. For example many countries require eyesight testing for licence renewal. There is also pressure on doctors to sign these forms because a car is often essential to avoid becoming housebound. The system needs the ability for independent assessment, though not necessarily at 70. There also needs to be a restoration and improvement in public transport so that older people who are unsafe, or choose not to drive, can continue to shop, visit friends, and participate in community activities.

It is hardly surprising that the first records of charismatic phenomena in the New Testament are contemporaneous with St Paul\u2019s efforts in his letters to calm down all the excitement, and to insist that the people who had the visions were not also those who got to pronounce on their significance and meaning. Again, the underlying phenomenon is remarkably common and the ability can be trained. Professor Tanya Luhrman\u2019s wonderful book When God Talks Back, about her experience as an anthropologist in a charismatic church, describes how members there were encouraged to treat God as an invisible friend: pouring a second cup of coffee for him at a break, and so on. For people with a particular character trait, measured on the Tellegen absorption scale \u2013 which is, roughly speaking, the ability to climb aboard a train of thought and have it carry you far from the everyday world \u2013 this kind of practice can lead to a constant sense of supernaturalism in the world. Welby rather wisely sidestepped the question of whether God talked to him as well as to some of his correspondents. His listeners on the evangelical radio will have taken it for granted, but no one in the outside world wants an archbishop who takes directions from God. That is altogether too much like religion and not what the Church of England stands for at all. But the urge to divine the future goes back a very long way into prehistory. Oracle bones are among the earliest relics of Chinese civilisation. The cracks that appeared when they were burned in fires were held to form significant patterns. The Greeks and Romans read the future in the spilled entrails of sacrificed birds. Even today, the urge to find significance in the apparently random opinions of complete strangers is hardly confined to archbishops. It\u2019s just that when journalists practise divination by taxi drivers, as foreign correspondents traditionally do, we call it a vox pop, not a vox dei. \u2022 Andrew Brown writes on religion. His book Fishing in Utopia is a memoir about his life in Sweden",

The proposals aim to bring people straight off these walkways into the centre, forming a continuous route that will take visitors into expansive foyers with views straight into the concert hall. \u201cWe want it to be transparent, porous and welcoming \u2013 everything that the current entrance to the Barbican is not.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"db9a6414d0793492c8b6193cccd558bd9917a5fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db9a6414d0793492c8b6193cccd558bd9917a5fe/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2026 the entry plaza at the proposed Centre for Music in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Transparent and porous\u2019 \u2026 the entry plaza at the proposed Centre for Music in London</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Diller Scofidio + Renfro/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Images show a place of open foyers dotted with informal performance spaces, where mezzanines, stairs and escalators create a vertical parade of places to see and be seen. Diller describes these open lobbies as \u201cthe theatre of the theatre \u2026 informal by day and very glamorous by night\u201d. It looks to have some of the open, loungey atmosphere of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/apr/05/national-theatre-makeover-haworth-tompkins-review-decluttered-beautiful\">Denys Lasdun\u2019s National Theatre</a>, only wrought in DS+R\u2019s familiar language of angled planes of timber veneer and lots of glass. Indeed, the whole thing looks like a greatest-hits mashup of the architects\u2019 back catalogue. There is the continuous vertical route of their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/03/roy-and-diana-vagelos-education-center-architecture-columbia-medical-school\">Vagelos Education Centre</a>, the triangular outdoor stepped seating of their <a href=\"https://dsrny.com/project/juilliard-school\">Juilliard School</a>, and the picture-window stage backdrop of their <a href=\"https://www.icaboston.org/about/about-barbara-lee-family-foundation-theater\">Boston ICA theatre</a>. For now, it all feels a bit flimsy, a flashy traffic cone that lacks the rugged solidity of the Barbican.</p> <p>The most radical potential impact of the scheme is at ground level, where the moat of traffic that has strangled the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jan/24/museum-of-london-gets-180m-towards-its-new-home\">Museum of London</a> will be transformed. The architects propose to reclaim the southern portion of the roundabout with a new pedestrian plaza, funnelling traffic from London Wall beneath the northern side of the building, to connect to Aldersgate. In keeping with the City\u2019s plans for further pedestrianisation, it would be a boon for walkers and cyclists alike, connecting into the evolving <a href=\"https://www.culturemile.london/\">\u201cculture mile\u201d</a>, reaching south to St Paul\u2019s Cathedral and Tate Modern beyond.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"495226cf3bfbb732f57559b8a4239892e1bbe7af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/495226cf3bfbb732f57559b8a4239892e1bbe7af/0_0_3500_1605/1000.jpg\" alt=\"an artist\u2019s rendering of an education pod.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"459\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018School children can see us properly working\u2019 \u2026 an artist\u2019s rendering of an education pod.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Diller Scofidio + Renfro/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The concert hall is conceived as a floating wooden cocoon, raised up above the road and arranged in vineyard style, with seating wrapping around the stage. Transparent \u201ceducation pods\u201d will dot the auditorium, providing spaces for school groups to watch the orchestral goings-on with added interpretation. It was an idea that came to the project\u2019s chief cheerleader,Sir Simon Rattle, after he visited <a href=\"https://www.fosterandpartners.com/projects/reichstag-new-german-parliament/\">Norman Foster\u2019s transformation of the Reichstag in Berlin</a>, where the public can see the parliament in action from a spiralling walkway. \u201cThere\u2019s something very powerful about seeing democracy at work,\u201d Rattle says. From the acoustic privacy of the proposed pods, \u201cschool children would see us properly working, a process that can be thrilling, inspiring and desperately hard work \u2013 and occasionally boring\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/21/first-designs-revealed-new-288m-london-concert-hall\">First designs revealed for new \u00a3288m London concert hall</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These pods, along with an entirely glazed clerestory level where the public can peer in, suggest a radically different form of concert hall, whose stratified levels also include little platforms where musicians could perform among the audience. \u201cWe want to break apart the conventions of just central looking,\u201d says Diller. Using the latest digital technology, she says the whole space could also be projection-mapped, turning the timber-lined space into a lush tropical forest at the touch of a button. The concert hall will be complemented by a smaller space for jazz and contemporary music at the summit of the pyramid, an angular crown nicknamed the \u201cCoda\u201d, which will feature a big picture window pointing towards the dome of St Paul\u2019s. Hovering over the City skyline, it could be a thrilling place to see a performance above the rooftops.</p> <p>But the elephant in the room is what takes up a major central chunk of the building. Between the two music venues hovers a four-storey block labelled as \u201ccommercial\u201d on the plans \u2013 valuable office space that will, it is hoped, pay for the running costs of the music centre. In the same way that the nearby Guildhall School of Music and Drama\u2019s theatre and concert hall has to lurk in the bowels of the <a href=\"https://www.gsmd.ac.uk/about_the_school/milton_court/\">Heron luxury apartment tower</a>, and DS+R\u2019s Shed cowers at the base of an <a href=\"https://dsrny.com/project/15-hudson-yards\">88-storey tower</a> in New York, it is an apt reflection of an era when culture \u2013 in the absence of public funding \u2013 must find a way to pay for itself.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Twisting pyramids seem to have become the accepted vernacular for London\u2019s big cultural buildings, as plans for the new \u00a3288m Centre for Music were unveiled on Monday. Following in the footsteps of Tate Modern\u2019s Switch House and the Aldwych student centre at the London School of Economics, the proposals for a new 2,000-seat concert hall take the form of a faceted ziggurat, rising from the roundabout site of the current Museum of London as an angular glass beacon. The design is the work of New York firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro, architects of the High Line and the forthcoming Shed cultural centre in their home city, who plan to bring their trademark angular, switchback geometries to the Square Mile. The early concept images show the building rising up in a series of tilted, sweeping planes, the ground folding up and over in steps and ramps to form a great vertical filo pastry. \u201cIt all started with the Barbican Highwalk,\u201d says Liz Diller, showing a scribbled concept sketch of the Barbican Centre\u2019s raised pedestrian walkways plunging to the ground before wrapping up again in a twisted spiral to form the shape of the 17-storey building. The proposals aim to bring people straight off these walkways into the centre, forming a continuous route that will take visitors into expansive foyers with views straight into the concert hall. \u201cWe want it to be transparent, porous and welcoming \u2013 everything that the current entrance to the Barbican is not.\u201d Images show a place of open foyers dotted with informal performance spaces, where mezzanines, stairs and escalators create a vertical parade of places to see and be seen. Diller describes these open lobbies as \u201cthe theatre of the theatre \u2026 informal by day and very glamorous by night\u201d. It looks to have some of the open, loungey atmosphere of Denys Lasdun\u2019s National Theatre, only wrought in DS+R\u2019s familiar language of angled planes of timber veneer and lots of glass. Indeed, the whole thing looks like a greatest-hits mashup of the architects\u2019 back catalogue. There is the continuous vertical route of their Vagelos Education Centre, the triangular outdoor stepped seating of their Juilliard School, and the picture-window stage backdrop of their Boston ICA theatre. For now, it all feels a bit flimsy, a flashy traffic cone that lacks the rugged solidity of the Barbican. The most radical potential impact of the scheme is at ground level, where the moat of traffic that has strangled the Museum of London will be transformed. The architects propose to reclaim the southern portion of the roundabout with a new pedestrian plaza, funnelling traffic from London Wall beneath the northern side of the building, to connect to Aldersgate. In keeping with the City\u2019s plans for further pedestrianisation, it would be a boon for walkers and cyclists alike, connecting into the evolving \u201cculture mile\u201d, reaching south to St Paul\u2019s Cathedral and Tate Modern beyond. The concert hall is conceived as a floating wooden cocoon, raised up above the road and arranged in vineyard style, with seating wrapping around the stage. Transparent \u201ceducation pods\u201d will dot the auditorium, providing spaces for school groups to watch the orchestral goings-on with added interpretation. It was an idea that came to the project\u2019s chief cheerleader,Sir Simon Rattle, after he visited Norman Foster\u2019s transformation of the Reichstag in Berlin, where the public can see the parliament in action from a spiralling walkway. \u201cThere\u2019s something very powerful about seeing democracy at work,\u201d Rattle says. From the acoustic privacy of the proposed pods, \u201cschool children would see us properly working, a process that can be thrilling, inspiring and desperately hard work \u2013 and occasionally boring\u201d. These pods, along with an entirely glazed clerestory level where the public can peer in, suggest a radically different form of concert hall, whose stratified levels also include little platforms where musicians could perform among the audience. \u201cWe want to break apart the conventions of just central looking,\u201d says Diller. Using the latest digital technology, she says the whole space could also be projection-mapped, turning the timber-lined space into a lush tropical forest at the touch of a button. The concert hall will be complemented by a smaller space for jazz and contemporary music at the summit of the pyramid, an angular crown nicknamed the \u201cCoda\u201d, which will feature a big picture window pointing towards the dome of St Paul\u2019s. Hovering over the City skyline, it could be a thrilling place to see a performance above the rooftops. But the elephant in the room is what takes up a major central chunk of the building. Between the two music venues hovers a four-storey block labelled as \u201ccommercial\u201d on the plans \u2013 valuable office space that will, it is hoped, pay for the running costs of the music centre. In the same way that the nearby Guildhall School of Music and Drama\u2019s theatre and concert hall has to lurk in the bowels of the Heron luxury apartment tower, and DS+R\u2019s Shed cowers at the base of an 88-storey tower in New York, it is an apt reflection of an era when culture \u2013 in the absence of public funding \u2013 must find a way to pay for itself.",

That soon led to regular appearances in Z Cars, plus several film roles. It was the theatre, however, that Jack loved. He performed at Leeds Playhouse for two seasons in the early 70s and also at the Manchester Royal Exchange. He turned down a permanent role in Coronation Street, preferring to appear in a string of classic stage roles. After a split with Sue in 1974, he took off for India, backpacking his way through Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan. On his return, he had long spells as the villainous Tom Merrick in Emmerdale and the historical series How We Used to Live, and a short run as a police officer, Tony Cunliffe, in Coronation Street. There was radio work, plus seasons at Crewe, Southampton and Sheffield. For Jack, the highlight was appearing in the English Shakespeare Company\u2019s cycle of seven history plays, which toured throughout the world, as well as being filmed for television under the title The Wars of the Roses. Wolfish good looks and a wicked smile kept Jack in work throughout the 90s, but a double hip replacement in his 50s, followed by heart surgery, ruled out the more energetic roles he preferred. Jack was always drawn to the racier, more bohemian side of life, enjoying the company of poachers, wheeler-dealers and outcasts, often in pubs and drinking dens. Latterly, he largely retired to a canal boat in Essex, on the rivers Stort and Lea, where he entertained friends and family with his irrepressible good humour and vitality. Jack is survived by his partner, Nicola Tipton, his daughter, Sophie, and granddaughter, Maddy.",

After all, this is the holders against a side who have never progressed beyond the quarter-finals of this competition. But it still will be ticklish. Uzbekistan won their opening two games and gave Japan a good run in the last.</p> <p><strong>The hope will be, for Australia,</strong> that after a slow start they are gaining momentum. Find out exactly how much momentum shortly. </p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 1am AEDT/2pm GMT/6pm local</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Stephen Ganavas\u2019s match report: We\u2019ll leave the final words to Martin Turnbull: \u201cOh yeah!\u201d he says, a relieved man, like many will be. And with that, we\u2019ll leave you. Australia are through to the quarter-finals of the Asian Cup. Just. Well then. The Australian players split their celebrations between Mat Ryan and Leckie, but it\u2019s the Brighton keeper that deserves most of the praise. He saved two of those efforts really well and put his country through to the next phase. It wasn\u2019t pretty for the most part, but Australia are through, where they will face either hosts UAE or the Kyrgyz Republic, whose game kicks off shortly. Matt Leckie buries it into the corner and Australia are into the quarter-finals! PENALTIES - Australia 3-2 Uzbekistan: Bikmaev stutters in his run up...AND RYAN SAVES! Bad penalty, good save, and Australia can go through if they score their next penalty! PENALTIES - Australia 3-2 Uzbekistan: Giannou for Australia...sends the keeper the wrong way. PENALTIES - Australia 2-2 Uzbekistan: Akibaev now...brilliant penalty, right into the corner beating Ryan\u2019s dive. PENALTIES - Australia 2-1 Uzbekistan: Kruse has a brief argument with the referee about placement of the ball on the spot...but then sticks it into the top corner. PENALTIES - Australia 1-1 Uzbekistan: Tukhtakhujaev can give Uzbekistan a big advantage...AND HE DOESN\u2019T! He smacks it high straight down the middle but unusually Ryan stays on his feet and SAVES BRILLIANTLY! PENALTIES - Australia 1-1 Uzbekistan: Behich up for Australia...and it\u2019s SAVED! Great stop down to his left. PENALTIES - Australia 1-1 Uzbekistan: Shukurov hammers it straight down the middle. PENALTIES - Australia 1-0 Uzbekistan: Nestorov gets a hand to it but Milligan buries his kick into the corner. Looks like Australia will take the first penalty. Milligan steps up... How are your nerves? Martin Turnbull\u2019s sound frayed... \u201cGetting worried, along with my son. Went to all the games four years ago - his first love of football. \u201cWe have the better keeper. Just not sure we have the better penalty takers...\u201d Penalties it is... 120 mins: Uzbekistan on the attack at the end, Alibaev taking a big wind-up at a shot from long-range but he completely skews it. 118 mins: Khashimov tosses another cross into the middle but it\u2019s too deep. That\u2019s been a feature of the centres from both sides, throughout the game. 115 mins: Milligan takes over long throw duty from the right but an Uzbek defender throws himself to the turf under minimal contact from Giannou, and a free-kick is given. 114 mins: Uzbekistan have been much the better side in this second-half of extra-time. Removing Rogic might turn out to be a mistake for Australia. 112 mins: Khashimov darts down the right and whips in a low cross, which is cleared at the near-post. He then crumples to the turf with cramp, making sure he stays on the pitch for his treatment. 111 mins: Getting pretty scrappy now. A slightly curious change as Massimo Luongo comes on for Rogic. The Celtic man had a ropey first-half but his influence grew as the game went on. Plus he can\u2019t play in the next game. All a bit odd. 109 mins: Grant takes a booking for pulling back Alibaev, grabbing several pieces of clothing as he hauls his man in. 107 mins: Cuper is going sub crazy: a further change as Azibek Turgunbaev comes on in place of Khamdamov. 106 mins: We\u2019re off again. No score yet. Australia are knocking on the door though. Peeeeeeeeeeeep. Still no score, another 15 to go... 105 mins: Kruse dribbles into the box but steps aside when Rogic arrives for the shot, which curls just wide of the post. Another change for Uzbekistan, as Farrukh Sayfiev replaces Zoteev. 104 mins: Grant hurls a long throw into the box from the right but Leckie was pushing his marker. Meanwhile Shomurodov is removed, replaced by Bikmaev. 103 mins: Leckie sticks one into the mixer looking for Giannou, but he can\u2019t quite win the header. Australia chipping away. 101 mins: Leckie stops and tries to flick a pass over the massed ranks of the Uzbek defence, but it goes to nobody and out for a goal-kick. 98 mins: Giannou passes along the edge of the box, Kruse dummies it for Behich who shoots, but straight at the keeper. 97 mins: Change for Australia: here is Robbie Kruse, on in place of Ikonomidis. 95 mins: Shomurdov, quite in the second-half of normal time after an excellent first 45 minutes, streaks towards goal on the counter but is halted by an Irvine tackle. Fairly? The referee says so, but the Uzbeks aren\u2019t so sure... 94 mins: Australia on the attack: Rogic has a shot which is beaten away, it falls to Leckie but his effort is weak and trickles through to the keeper. 92 mins: Ikonomidis cuts in from the left and shoots towards the near-post, but that\u2019s saved by Nesterov. 91 mins: We\u2019re off in extra-time. Tense moments... Daniel Graham has some observations: \u201cAussies moving the ball way too slowly - Uzbeks just stood there. A complete lack of quality on both sides \u201cWhat has Arnie got on the bench to change things?\u201d Erm...Robbie Kruse? Andrew Nabbout? Well then. Australia got better - much better, although they couldn\u2019t have been much worse - in the second-half, but couldn\u2019t punch through. Will they manage it in the 30 minutes of extra-time? Peeeeeeeeeeeep. 90 mins + 2: Close! Ikonomidis stands up a cross from the left which Giannou gets his head to, but can\u2019t beat the keeper. 90 min +1: The first of three minutes injury-time...can Australia find a winner? 90 mins: Khashimov puts over a cross which is put behind for a corner by Sainsbury, as we enter stoppage time... 88 mins: Extra-time looks imminent.... 87 mins: Have Uzbekistan been playing rope-a-dope for the whole second-half. Suddenly they look revitalised and on the attack... 86 mins: HUGE chance for Uzbekistan. A cross comes in from the left, it goes over Shomurodov\u2019s head and Masharipov meets it on the volley...but it\u2019s deflected wide. Eeesh, that was close. 84 mins: A rare Uzbekistan attack ends with a wayward cross. And then they\u2019re back to them parking the bus as Australia pass it around. Rogic tries a cross from deep, but it\u2019s too strong and goes over the heads of the attackers. 82 mins: \u201cIt\u2019s the little stuff with Australia that is the most frustrating,\u201d writes a frustrated Clare Lawrence. \u201cPasses are constantly too long, short, hard, soft or just plain inaccurate. It\u2019s hard to put a team performance together when we can\u2019t even distribute the ball. Is this just the life of an Australian supporter?\u201d 81 mins: Ikonomidis puts the corner into the middle and it goes within a whisker of Irvine and another Australian (couldn\u2019t quite see who) as they attacked it in the box. Closer, closer, closer. 80 mins: Australia are getting closer: Rogic shoots, it takes a deflection and was probably heading wide anyway, but Nesterov scrambles to the right and paws it behind for a corner anyway. 78 mins: Khashimov is pretty lucky to stay on the pitch, after ploughing through the back of Milligan. He gets a stern talking to but no more from a referee who has discovered leniency in the second-half, after previously dishing out yellows like free cans of a new fizzy drink outside a train station. 77 mins: Close! Close! Close! Leckie skips down the right, beats his man and enters the area, shoots across goal but it\u2019s saved, and the rebound is smuggled clear by Ismailov before any of the other Australian attackers could react. 75 mins: Another sub for Australia: Apostolos Giannou comes on in place of Maclaren. 73 mins: Change for Uzbekistan: Alibaev is on in place of Sidikov. 72 mins: Leckie lines up a shot from about 25 yards out, which makes it through the massed ranks of the Uzbek defence and bounces just in front of Nesterov, and the keeper makes an awkward-looking but ultimately effective save, punching the ball clear. 70 mins: Big chance: Rogic passes to Ikonomidis down the left, he cuts back to Rogic who tries a sort of pass-shot hybrid, stabbing the ball into the six-yard box from the edge of the box, where Maclaren stretches but just can\u2019t divert the ball towards goal. He might have been offside anyway, but Australia continue to improve. 68 mins: Change for Australia: Matt Leckie is on for Mabil. Mabil doesn\u2019t look entirely impressed, leaving the pitch on the right side when the benches are on the Australian left. An injury or a tantrum? 66 mins: Short corner for Australia on the right, but Rogic\u2019s cross to the far post is too strong. The Celtic man is usually Australia\u2019s most creative threat, but has been very quiet so far: just an off day, or maybe he\u2019s been spooked by that early goal which will rule him out of the next match. If there is a next match for Australia, that is. 64 mins: Uzbekistan have been quiet in the second period so far but Khashimov gets down the right and zips in the cross, which is headed clear by Sainsbury. 62 mins: Ikonomidis runs down the left and reaches the edge of the box, and looks like his run is curtailed by a heavy challenge from Khamadmov, but the referee turns down the appeals. Ikonomidis might have been penalised for staying on his feet there. 60 mins: Huge chance for Grant again. Mabil delivers a corner from the right, it eventually falls to Degenek outside the box, he skims a cross to the back stick where Grant arrives at pace and gets the header, inside the six-yard box but at a tight angle, but sends it over the bar. 59 mins: Here\u2019s Martin Turnbull again: \u201cOz is sorely lacking a midfielder with authority. Missing Mile big time.\u201d 58 mins: Chance for Australia: they get a little joy down the right of the box, the cross comes in which is half-cleared but drops to Grant, rushing forwards from right-back, and his looping header is on target but saved. Again, thin gruel, but signs of improvement at least. 55 mins: Some vaguely promising signs for Australia: Mabil gets down the right but his cross is blocked, then there\u2019s a spell of possession which ends with Rogic\u2019s long pass intercepted. Clutching at straws perhaps, but that was a little better. 52 mins: The ball is played out to the left of the area to Behich, who controls and tries to bring infield, but he stops dead after a clash with Khamdamov. Behich claims he was hit in the face, but at worst that was a rogue hand with no real aggressive intent: no free-kick, and really there was no way he should have stopped waiting for the referee to give him a decision, there. 51 mins: Rogic receives the ball in plenty of space outside the box, looks left, looks right but decides to put his head down and drive into the box himself. But he\u2019s crowded out and eventually just runs the ball out for a goal-kick. A neat summary of things so far for Australia: when they\u2019ve had the ball, they haven\u2019t really known what to do with it. 49 mins: Neither side really able to put their foot on the ball so far. If Arnold gave the Aussies a rocket at the break, it hasn\u2019t showed yet. 46 mins: A spicy start to the second-half as Khashimov goes flying into Behich, studs up, and gets a massive chunk of the Aussie full-back\u2019s foot. Interesting one for the referee: in most circumstances that was probably a yellow card, but by the standards of the booking he dished out before the break, it was a red. In the end, he chooses yellow. The players are out for the second-half. Can Australia find something? Can Uzbekistan convert their dominance into goals? Martin Turnbull is telling it like it is: \u201cLet\u2019s not sugarcoat it. The worst Oz side in a decade.\u201d Well, no doubt who was the better team in that half. Uzbekistan were dangerous and purposeful, the one thing perhaps missing being a great final ball or a real, clear chance on goal beyond the one Shomurodov hit straight at Ryan early on. Australia, by contrast, were stilted in possession, blunt going forwards and iffy at the back. Plenty of work for Graham Arnold to do at the break. Peeeeeeeeeeep. 45 mins: Milligan feeds Mabil on the right, who has been quiet as a mouse so far, but despite having options in the box he plays a pass right back to the Australian defence. The ball comes back upfield, Rogic has the ball on the edge of the box with a shooting chance, but it\u2019s on his right side and he isn\u2019t confident enough to take the effort. Another attack fizzles. 43 mins: Finally a little attacking purpose from Australia, as Behich and Ikonomidis exchange passes down the left, but eventually the latter overruns things and Uzbekistan get it clear. 42 mins: Masharipov makes some more tricky moves down the left, he cuts in on his right foot but puts far too much on the cross and it sails over the heads of everyone in the box. 40 mins: ...and after all that discussion, Rogic thumps it into the wall. Not great, this. 39 mins: Behich tries to make something down the left, but in the end is fouled by Khashimov. A number of Australian players gather around the ball to debate what to do with the free-kick, around 25 yards out to the left... 36 mins: More troubling signs for Australia, even if the eventual shot ends up in the stands. Shomurodov simply bullies Sainsbury down the left side of the box, he checks back and tees up Khamdamov, who blazes the left-footed effort from about 25 yards high over the bar. But the ease with which they built that attack and the time Khamdamov had to shoot should be worrying for Arnold. 35 mins: Quiet spell of the game. Rogic leads a counter-attack for Australia but after he spreads the ball left to Ikonomidis, a heavy first touch gives Khashimov the chance to put in a saving tackle, which he does. 32 mins: Maclaren gets the ball fairly deep and tries to clip a pass over the top, but it\u2019s far too strong and gently trots out for a goal-kick. 31 mins: Australia still really struggling to get any sort of meaningful attack going. They do at least have a spell of possession, but it\u2019s fairly sterile, lots of sideways passing around the halfway line. 28 mins: Yeesh, Uzbekistan go very, very close. Brilliant work from Masharipov, cutting in from the left, dancing past a couple of Australian defenders like they\u2019re training cones. He squares to Sidikov, about 25 yards out, who shoots low, with some power but it skips just past the post. 25 mins: Another yellow card: Behich is the latest man to go in the book, for a very slightly late challenge on Khamdamov. Extremely harsh. Going on the opening 25 minutes, it\u2019ll be astonishing if we end the game with 22 players on the pitch. 24 mins: Early thoughts on the emails from Clare Lawrence: \u201cThe Uzbeks have nice fluid movement between the lines in attack and a good high press. Australia need to react quicker both in attack and defence and be more creative. \u201cReferee is certainly card happy which doesn\u2019t bode well for the game moving forward.\u201d 22 mins: A ball over the top looks for Maclaren but it\u2019s just too strong for the forward and goes through to the keeper. Australia just haven\u2019t got going yet. 21 mins: Have I mentioned former Valencia and Inter manager Hector Cuper is in charge of Uzbekistan? Well, he is. 19 mins: And now some more rough-housing from Australia...well, sort of, but this one is pretty damaging. Rogic plays a pass to his right, just eluding the challenge of Masharipov, but in putting his foot down following the ball he stepped on his opponent\u2019s foot. Yellow card, most look entirely baffled but it means Rogic will miss the quarter-final, should Australia make it through. Big blow, that. 17 mins: One way to deal with the threat of Shomurodov is to give him a kick, which Sainsbury does, taking his man out on the left touchline. A free-kick is given but no more, and the Uzbek forward goes down holding his back. 15 mins: No doubt who\u2019s been the better side so far: Uzbekistan are knocking the ball around with purpose and confidence, and it might be troubling for Graham Arnold that his side have started slowly for the second game in a row. A pass through the defence by Akhmedov is cut out by Degenek, but not convincingly and it takes another go to properly propel it from danger. 12 mins: Australia take their first shot on goal: the ball falls to Behich, loping forward from left-back, on the edge of the box, but while his effort had a bit of oomph behind it, it was straight at the keeper who saves with relative ease. 10 mins: Huge chance for Uzbekistan: they win the ball strongly in midfield, then Shomorodov is set away down the left side of the box. The Australian defence just seems to melt away, leaving Mat Ryan as the last/only line of defence, but luckily for the Aussies the Brighton keeper stays big and stops a toe-punted shot. Slightly troubling how easy that was for the Uzbeks, though. 8 mins: Shukurov tries to test his goalkeeper\u2019s stones/control by absolutely battering a pass back, but fortunately Nesterov, the man with the gloves, dealt with it rather nicely. 5 mins: Uzbekistan have a spell of patient possession, initially moving to attack but when that became untenable they calmly passed it back and started again. A long diagonal finds Masharipov on the left side of the box and his fine first touch takes him past Grant, but Sainsbury swoops in to clear up the danger. 3 mins: Milligan takes the resultant free-kick but his skimmed ball to the back post is too strong. 2 mins: A big ball up field finds Maclaren, and his knock-down eventually makes its way to Milligan, but his shot is blocked. Then Maclaren is wiped out by the nails-looking centre-back Tukhtakhujaev - no early reticence with the cards from the referee, he flashes the yellow before the end of the second minute. 1 min: We\u2019re away. The first casualty of the game is Jackson Irvine, who goes up for a header and comes down holding his neck. Doesn\u2019t look too serious though... The players are out. Coldplay is on the PA. The one about the stars. No, not that one, the other one. If you\u2019re after one to watch from the Uzbekistan side...well, I can\u2019t pretend to be an expert on Uzbek football, but the obvious one would seem to be Eldor Shomurodov, their 23-year-old forward. He plays for FC Rostov in Russia and, while he hasn\u2019t pulled up many trees there, he has scored in every game at this tournament so far. \u201cWhat price on Graham Arnold\u2019s retention as coach if the Socceroos exit early from the Asian Cup, given Alen Stajcic\u2019 s sacking?\u201d writes Lawrie Smith. On the off chance you missed this, Stajcic was surprisingly removed from his position as Matildas coach last week, despite a good results record and to the widespread dismay of the players. Some details here: A little dash of David Squires will always liven up your day: here he is on the tournament so far. Match preview? Match preview. Here\u2019s Stephen Ganavas with all you need to know. Just the one change for Australia, and a pretty predictable one: Trent Sainsbury returns after a one-game suspension with Massimo Luongo dropping out, which obviously means Mark Milligan returning to midfield. Australia Ryan; Grant, Degenek, Sainsbury, Behich; Irvine, Rogic, Milligan; Mabil, Maclaren, Ikonomidis Uzbekistan Nesterov, Ismailov, Khaskimov, Zoteev, Tukhtakhujaev, Akhemdov, Khamdamov, Shukurov, Sidikov, Masharipov, Shomurodov. The group stage is all about getting through. At the 1982 World Cup Italy drew their round robin games but scraped into the next round, and eventually won the thing. Four years ago Australia lost to South Korea, finished second in their group but progressed and lifted the title. Their opening games this time were arguably even scrappier than that, but the point is Australia are here, in the knockout round, still alive and contending. Now that the hefty sigh of relief has been breathed, they might be able to grow a little confidence. They won their latter pair of games, the second in particular, a madcap win against a Syrian team playing with the freedom of the eliminated and a side with a manager they all liked (the previous one having been sacked a few days earlier) displaying no little skill and character. On the face of things, you would imagine this to be...not a straightforward tie, but one Australia should win. After all, this is the holders against a side who have never progressed beyond the quarter-finals of this competition. But it still will be ticklish. Uzbekistan won their opening two games and gave Japan a good run in the last. The hope will be, for Australia, that after a slow start they are gaining momentum. Find out exactly how much momentum shortly. Kick-off: 1am AEDT/2pm GMT/6pm local",

Co-directed by Bond and Gavin Robins in collaboration with NSW physical theatre company Legs on The Wall, it\u2019s one of the hottest tickets at this year\u2019s Sydney festival.</p> <p>Through the story of an Aboriginal family living in semi-rural Australia, the narrative explores the universal themes of love, loss and the devastation of suicide. Twins Bear and Evelyn are not long out of high school and are living with their mum, Rose, dreaming of life beyond their small town. The close-knit family shares laughter and an easy affection but is still living with the loss of Rose\u2019s husband, the twins\u2019 father, who took his own life years earlier. Then another suicide hits the family, and the trauma resurfaces. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jan/18/i-wont-give-up-why-an-artist-is-living-in-a-gallery-making-10000-paper-boats\">'I won't give up': why an artist is living in a gallery making 10,000 paper boats</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Man with the Iron Neck invites the audience to reflect on what is worth living for when faced with pain and trauma, both personal and inherited.

      "bodyText": "After losing a young family member to suicide, Josh Bond found himself in the midst of an existential and emotional crisis. Grappling with the unanswerable, he became fascinated with the famous 1920s German acrobat The Great Peters: a stuntman whose signature trick was surviving leaps from a 23 metre platform with a hangman\u2019s noose around his neck. It\u2019s this preoccupation with defying death that underlies The Man With the Iron Neck, an aerial theatre show. Co-directed by Bond and Gavin Robins in collaboration with NSW physical theatre company Legs on The Wall, it\u2019s one of the hottest tickets at this year\u2019s Sydney festival. Through the story of an Aboriginal family living in semi-rural Australia, the narrative explores the universal themes of love, loss and the devastation of suicide. Twins Bear and Evelyn are not long out of high school and are living with their mum, Rose, dreaming of life beyond their small town. The close-knit family shares laughter and an easy affection but is still living with the loss of Rose\u2019s husband, the twins\u2019 father, who took his own life years earlier. Then another suicide hits the family, and the trauma resurfaces. The Man with the Iron Neck invites the audience to reflect on what is worth living for when faced with pain and trauma, both personal and inherited. The work was met with critical acclaim when it premiered at Brisbane festival last year, and its themes have only become more urgent: in the first weeks of 2019, five Aboriginal girls under the age of 15 took their own lives, with a sixth taken to hospital after a suspected suicide attempt. Bond says the piece of physical theatre has been a labour of love for the creative team and cast, the majority of whom are Indigenous and have themselves been affected by the suicide epidemic that is Australia\u2019s great ongoing tragedy. \u201cI really believe it is each of our own experiences which has driven the passion to tell this story, to spread awareness and to find healing for ourselves, as much as for our audience.\u201d Brilliant writing by Ursula Yovich, who in a heartbreakingly affecting turn also plays the role of Rose, has been deftly guided by dramaturg Steve Rogers.

      "bodyText": "The national integrity commission should have powers to tap phones and use undercover officers to investigate alleged corruption, according to Queensland\u2019s anti-corruption body. The Crime and Corruption Commission has called for the covert powers in a submission to a parliamentary inquiry examining crossbench proposals for a national body, championed by MP Cathy McGowan and Greens senator Larissa Waters. In December the Morrison government proposed creating the national integrity commission within the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity because it has \u201cserious investigative tools\u201d to build briefs against people who have acted corruptly. The attorney general, Christian Porter, has said the Coalition\u2019s preferred body would have 150 staff and a budget of $125m over four years, but its powers are still the subject of public consultation. In its submission, the CCC noted the crossbench bills would give the integrity commission power to compel evidence, seize documents with a warrant, and use federal police or other authorised officers to make arrests. But it said the bill appears to leave it without powers to set up operations with assumed identities, surveillance devices and telecommunications interception. It recommended the integrity commission gain these powers, which it described as \u201coften essential to the investigation and detection of corruption offences\u201d. The CCC said it was important for the integrity commission to \u201chave power to continue and complete investigations and other inquiries into corruption issues notwithstanding any pending trial\u201d. It said the bills lacked \u201cprotection against contempt proceedings for NIC investigations and other inquiries related to corruption issues\u201d which could \u201cseverely compromise the capacity of the NIC to conduct and complete effective investigations\u201d. The CCC called for a provision equivalent to Queensland\u2019s, which allows corruption investigations to continue with closed hearings if to do otherwise would prejudice the accused\u2019s right to a fair criminal trial. The CCC commended the aims of the national integrity commission, suggesting an independent anti-corruption body will \u201cpromote public confidence in commonwealth institutions and advance a national whole of government approach to the reduction of public sector corruption\u201d. The body should also have the \u201cexpress power to give intelligence information\u201d to other entities, such as state anti-corruption and law enforcement agencies, it said. In 2016 the commonwealth ombudsman noted while the ACLEI has special powers to investigate corruption \u2013 including phone taps \u2013 it lacks resources to build a covert operations unit and electronic surveillance capabilities. In August the Australia Institute\u2019s expert panel of former judges proposed a design for a federal anti-corruption commission with a broad jurisdiction and the ability to hold public hearings, but did not express a view on covert surveillance powers and phone taps. The Victorian Inspectorate \u2013 which oversees that state\u2019s integrity functions including the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission \u2013 expressed concern the federal equivalent does not have enough independence. It cited the fact the proposed parliamentary inspector could be removed by the presiding officers in parliament, the president of the Senate and speaker of the House of Representatives, and is dependent on them for staff and resources.",

      "bodyText": "Before I moved to Sydney I would look at Max Dupain\u2019s famous Sunbaker photo and think: I do not recognise that beach. Where, for example, is the person in the overcoat and beanie? Where is the person covered in sand? Where are the surfers in full steamers with blue extremities? If you are from the south-west coast of Victoria, and your ocean is the mighty Southern Ocean, none of the eastern seaboard beach iconography resonates. The south-west coast has some of the most dramatic, beautiful, inhospitable, remote and wild beaches in the world. And much of it is best experienced at a distance. Growing up in Warrnambool, there were only two hot days a year and even then the water was rough and freezing. Southerly blusters would barrel down the beach. You hardly ever saw anyone sit on the sand \u2013 it was like having a mini microdermabrasion. No one I knew had a tan, unless they had rich parents and could afford to holiday on the Gold Coast. Nor were there any businesses in town that offered waxing. No need. You rugged up to go to the beach. Excess body hair was a good thing! Life alongside the Southern Ocean was experienced in different ways than life at the more basic beaches of the Pacific. The novelist and keen surfer Jock Serong, from nearby Port Fairy, puts it this way: \u201cCulturally in the south-west you go to the beach to do something \u2013 you fish, you birdwatch, you surf.\u201d Sitting on your towel, on the sand, and reading a book is a rare sight on the Southern Ocean beaches. Growing up, the beach was great for walks while contemplating weighty things \u2013 the meaning of a confusing Smiths lyric, a complex Yeats poem or the point of life. You could walk for hours along dramatic coastal paths and broad beaches, sand ridged in patterns the wind made, and seldom see another person. You might glimpse the migrating southern right whales coming into Warrnambool to calve or if you were further up the coast towards Portland, colonies of seals. And all along that coastline, the tiny marks in the sand, made by the light feet of the hooded plover. It even smells different on the south-west coast. It\u2019s the intoxicating scent of salt and the dry grass that grows in tufts from the sand dunes. Years of taking the train home down the coast, and I\u2019d always feel roused when I could start to smell that clear, dry grassy smell. Almost home.

But even with falling house prices in Sydney there is little reason to believe the policy is less popular than it was three years ago. One of my favourite fear articles of late was in the Australian this week, which used data from the Australian National University\u2019s Australian electoral study of the 2016 election to estimate that \u201cwhile half of all property investors voted for the Coalition at the last federal election, 26 per cent gave their vote to Labor, suggesting the opposition\u2019s proposal to grandfather negative gearing risks putting these voters offside\u201d. I\u2019m not quite sure why those 26% of investors would now change their vote due to negative gearing given the ALP went to the 2016 election with the exact same policy. Apparently 26% of investors who were happy with a policy in 2016 now might decide they dislike it enough to change their vote \u2013 even though the changes would be grandfathered and thus would not affect them. Fear and logic do not make for good bedfellows. The policy has now been in place for more than three years, so you would expect that voters\u2019 feeling are quite baked into their voting choices. However given the recent falls in housing prices, we can expect many arguing that the clampdown on negative gearing was good policy in 2016, but is now dangerous because it could send prices down further. The weakness in the housing market was highlighted by the most recent housing and lending finance data from the Bureau of Statistics. While October had seen a surprising increase in housing finance commitments, it was, as I had suggested at the time a bit of a statistical flub. In November, housing finance fell 2.8% in seasonally adjusted terms and 1.3% in trend terms: It marked the 16th consecutive month of falling housing finance commitments in trend terms \u2013 the second longest such streak recorded. And while there are falls in owner-occupier financing, the big drop remains that of investors: In New South Wales alone (which really means Sydney) the 12-month total of investor finance for the construction of dwellings and for the purchase of property is down 19% from its recent peak of August 2017: But the fall hasn\u2019t been confined to NSW. Since August 2017, annual investor housing finance commitments have fallen 16% in both Queensland and Western Australia, 12% in South Australia and 11% in Victoria. Only Tasmania has seen an increase, but given the value of its finance equals only around 1% of that for NSW, it has little impact on the overall figures. All up it means that investor housing finance commitments in November across Australia were 21% below what they were a year ago and total housing finance was 15% down: Does this mean that a clamp-down on negative gearing is no longer needed, and that politically it will also be less popular than in June 2016? On this it is worth remembering that the growth of housing finance in the first half of 2016 was also falling. In February 2016 investor finance commitments were 21% below what they had been a year earlier, and overall housing finance was down 8%. What turned it around was the RBA cutting the cash rate from 2.0% to 1.75% in May that year and then down again to 1.5% in August. This means that housing finance commitments \u2013 especially those of investors \u2013 dropping does not really say much about the viability or popularity of a negative gearing policy. And it is important to remember as well that the real political popularity of restricting negative gearing is about housing affordability, not whether people who own a holiday home on the coast will any longer be able to use it to reduce their taxable income (as the Australian laughably focused on late last year). Since the last election, other than some small falls in NSW and Victoria and a large fall in Western Australia due to the end of the mining boom, the average owner occupier mortgage has risen consistently. Before 2016, the average mortgage rate in NSW and Victoria was rising much faster than it is currently. However, in all other states the annual growth of the average mortgage is now growing faster than it was a the last election. Since the June 2016 election, the size of the average mortgage has risen around 5% in NSW, 7% in Victoria, 10% in Queensland and 6% in South Australia. In that time wages have risen just 4.5%. If we look at the weeks required to earn a 20% deposit on a house based on the value of average mortgage in NSW, it is true there has not been much of an increase since 2016, and that may suggest the issue of housing affordability is less heated than at the last election. But for a couple in NSW with a male on the average full-time earnings and a women earning 50% of the average full-time rate (which gives them a combined annual income of $131,974), the 45.6 weeks taken to earn a 20% deposit remains well above what it was before the housing boom, let alone the 31 weeks at the turn of the century: The scare campaign on negative gearing and other tax measures will of course continue \u2013 the closer to an election a government gets and the more it lags in the polls the more it comes to rely on fear.

The heritage-protected Narran Lakes and wetlands are empty too, and with them have gone the breeding grounds of native birds and fish. The landscape next to the Castlereagh Highway Gamilaraay people and farmers rarely agree, but they are all worried their town of Walgett has six months to live if they don\u2019t get any more water. A few weeks ago, the Keepit Dam upstream released a series of \u201cenvironmental\u201d flows that started to trickle down into their part of the Namoi five days ago. A couple of farmers have come down to the boat ramp outside Walgett this morning to see if the river has risen overnight, but it looks like it\u2019s pooling at the weir and won\u2019t reach the town pumps. A map of Walgett After this flow, the Keepit Dam is down to 0.5% capacity; there will be no more water coming down the river unless it rains. Walgett will have to live on bore water indefinitely.

Two weeks ago, NSW Health issued an alert for the safe use of bore water, alarming some locals by describing the potential for amoebic meningitis. NSW Health\u2019s director of environmental health, Richard Broome, said the amoeba that occurs in warm natural surface waters and soil causes infection which is rare but nearly always fatal. \u201cAmoebic meningitis can occur if water containing active amoebae goes up someone\u2019s nose,\u201d Broome said. \u201cAt particular risk are people in rural areas who have their own tank, dam or bore water supply, such as those living on farms, and people with poorly maintained swimming pools. \u201cAny unchlorinated water supply that seasonally exceeds 30C or continually exceeds 25C may be a risk. This includes lakes, rivers, dams, bores, tanks, garden hoses, natural hot springs, and spa and swimming pools that are poorly maintained. \u201cPeople should be careful to prevent water going up their nose while swimming, diving or falling into warm, unchlorinated water, or while children are playing under garden sprinklers,\u201d Broome said.

Vanessa Hickey standing next to the empty Barwon River \u201cWhen we got water, we\u2019re happy. We are river people. \u201cAll I want to do is protect it. I\u2019ve seen the destruction in 20 years. Look at it now! \u201cWe had two beautiful, flowing, fast rivers. Today, we got nothing, I can touch the bottom of the Barwon. 20 years ago, we would jump in, trying to touch the bottom. \u201cMy kids are never going to have what I had growing up and that\u2019s heartbreaking for me. It\u2019s sad. It took a few greedy people, and now we\u2019ve got nothing. \u201cI don\u2019t like coming down here, sharing stories with my son, I just break down and cry. What is there for him? \u201cYou got no water, you got no life.\u201d Hickey wants to develop a ranger program to look after country, to monitor the health of the rivers and make sure water users do the right thing. \u201cI\u2019d sit out here all night if I had to, if it made a difference.\u201d * * * There\u2019s lots of roadkill on the road from Walgett to Lightning Ridge \u2013 kangaroos, emus, the odd wild pig \u2013 drawn to the grass on the roadside and felled by road trains carrying feed or cattle or cotton. Rhonda Ashby lives in Lightning Ridge, and teaches Gamilaraay language at the school. Ashby was born and raised on the banks of the Barwon River at Walgett. \u201cI haven\u2019t got words for how this feels. It\u2019s a deep grief,\u201d Ashby says. Rhonda Ashby and her nephew Creed Gordon in Lightning Ridge \u201cI remember those rivers being crystal clear. As kids we used to dive for mussels and throw them back up the bank to cook and eat.\u201d \u201cThere were stories about the water dog, Marrayin, the mirri, going down all the way to Menindee. The water dog lived in a water hole there and we knew to be careful and not be there after dark. He was there to make us aware of the rules,\u201d she says. \u201cThe river has a responsibility not just to us, but to plant and animals. It has a right to connect up to other waters. It\u2019s the bloodline of this country. It\u2019s like us: if our blood stops flowing, we get sick. The water, if that flow stops, we all become sick.\u201d \u201cWhen I lost my mum, the first place I looked to go was the river. I didn\u2019t want to be around people, I went to the river and sat and mourned. It helped me to grieve. \u201cIt\u2019s like a library. The river is a quiet space. Those trees are like books, full of stories of the place, it\u2019s a place of knowledge. It\u2019s where you look for quietness.\u201d * * * North of Lightning Ridge is the Narran River, another artery in the Murray-Daring system. It\u2019s where my grandmother was born. There are a couple of birthing trees still left, where Yuwalaraay women would have their babies. Newborns were washed in the river. People knew the exact spot on the riverbank where their life began. The Narran is dry too. Brenda McBride is a senior Gamilaraay-Yuwalaraay woman taking care of this place. The water, McBride says, is held in massive dams upstream by irrigators, miners and pastoralists, including the huge Cubbie station. Cubbie is licensed to take 460,000 megalitres, the equivalent of all irrigation entitlements downstream in north-western NSW, for its cotton farms. McBride picks up a handful of black soil where the river used to be. \u201cThese veins off the Murray-Darling are just as important as the river. The water has got a memory. It lives in a cycle. Everyone\u2019s pulling the water out, so it\u2019s just not coming here. With land clearing we get dust storms every week. It just breaks your heart. \u201cYou can walk up and down the Narran. Nothing. We know who\u2019s got the water \u2013 Cubbie.\u201d \u201cWhere is our water? For our totems \u2013 you\u2019re the turtle, I\u2019m the dhinawan, the emu. That\u2019s a part of you, gone.\u201d * * * Just on sunset, Ashby takes us up to Kangaroo Point in Lightning Ridge. Her nephew Creed, 12, is in the car. I ask him, what does he think of the water shortages? Gamilaraay elder and cultural educator Brenda McBride standing in the empty Narran River north of Lightning Ridge \u201cIt\u2019s so bad. It makes me sad what\u2019s happening, with irrigation and mismanagement of the water. \u201cSome say it\u2019s drought but it\u2019s cockies [landholders] pumping all the water out,\u201d Creed says. \u201cWater is life. Most people grew up on the river hearing stories and if there\u2019s no river, where\u2019s our culture?\u201d",

Since the early 1980s, median wealth among black and Latino families has been stuck at less than $10,000. The median black family today owns $3,600 \u2013 just 2% of the $147,000 of wealth the median white family owns. The median Latino family has assets worth $6,600 \u2013 just 4% of the median white family. In other words, the median white family has 41 times more wealth than the median black family and 22 times more wealth than the median Latino family. \u201cMedian wealth\u201d refers to the household at the exact middle of wealth distribution \u2013 with half of households above and half below. That\u2019s different from \u201caverage wealth\u201d, which skews the numbers by including the wealth of the richest 1%. (Average white wealth, for example, was $930,000 in 2016. But the ordinary white person isn\u2019t close to being a millionaire.) Changes in median wealth give us a multi-decade understanding of economic security and wellbeing. Since 1983, median wealth for all US households declined by 3%, adjusting for inflation. Over this same period, the median Black family saw their wealth drop by more than half. Meanwhile, the number of households with $10m or more soared by 856%. If the trajectory of the past three decades continues, by 2050 the median white family will have $174,000 of wealth, while Latino median wealth will be just $8,600 \u2013 and black median wealth will head downward to $600. In fact, the median black family is on track to reach zero wealth by 2082. While the middle stagnates and the very top soars away, there\u2019s also surging growth at the bottom end of the spectrum. A growing number of households are \u201cunderwater\u201d when it comes to wealth. The proportion of all US households \u2013 of any race \u2013 with zero or \u201cnegative\u201d wealth (meaning their debts exceed the value of their assets) has grown from one in six in 1983 to one in five households today. Families of color are much likelier to be in this precarious financial situation. 37% of black families and 33% of Latino families have zero or negative wealth, compared with just 15.5% of white families. These racial wealth divisions are damaging to the economy as a whole. Low levels of black and Latino wealth, combined with their growing proportion of the population, are a significant contributor to the overall decline in American median household wealth. Meanwhile, efforts to close the racial economic divide have been thwarted by the larger economic inequalities surging through the economy. Billionaire-bankrolled outfits like the Koch network, for example, have invested heavily in politicians that have made the tax code more unequal than ever. Public policies aimed at reducing both overall inequality and the racial wealth divide in particular will be critical to creating a more equitable economic system. Such policies could include the expansion of first-time homeownership programs and the creation of a \u201cbaby bond\u201d program, to seed an asset account for each newborn. But we also must address the overall challenges of inequality with policies to raise the minimum wage and expand healthcare, while taxing the 1% to fund education and infrastructure that create an economy that works for everyone, not just the super-rich.

      "bodyText": "David Cameron never believed he would have to hold an EU referendum because he expected to fall short of an overall majority in the 2015 election, according to Donald Tusk. The European council president said the then British prime minister had told him he was relaxed about promising the referendum \u2013 which he had done to appease Eurosceptics in his party \u2013 because he thought he would again be in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, who would block any such move. In an interview as part of a BBC documentary, Tusk said: \u201cI asked David Cameron, \u2018Why did you decide on this referendum, this \u2013 it\u2019s so dangerous, so even stupid, you know,\u2019 and, he told me \u2013 and I was really amazed and even shocked \u2013 that the only reason was his own party.\u201d Tusk continued: \u201c[He told me] he felt really safe, because he thought at the same time that there\u2019s no risk of a referendum, because his coalition partner, the Liberals, would block this idea of a referendum. But then, surprisingly, he won and there was no coalition partner. So paradoxically David Cameron became the real victim of his own victory.\u201d Tusk\u2019s remarks, which echo longstanding suspicions that Cameron never intended to hold a referendum, were immediately disputed by Craig Oliver who was Cameron\u2019s director of communications in Downing Street. He tweeted: \u201cThis is completely wrong. David Cameron spent the whole of the 2015 election campaign making clear he would not lead any form of government that didn\u2019t have a referendum. Look at almost any interview he did. The coalition as \u2018excuse to bail\u2019 is a myth.\u201d Tusk also said he warned Cameron that his decision to hold the referendum was \u201cstupid\u201d. He said he also warned him that his attempt to secure a deal on free movement of people before the poll was doomed to fail. In the documentary, Inside Europe: 10 Years of Turmoil, Tusk said: \u201cI told him bluntly \u2018Come on David, get real\u2019. I know that all prime ministers are promising to help you, but believe me the truth is that no one has an appetite for revolution in Europe only because of your stupid referendum. \u201cIf you try to force us, to hurry us, you will lose everything. And for the first time I saw something close to fear in his eyes. He finally realised what a challenge he was facing.\u201d Tusk also recalls a telephone conversation with Cameron during which he learned he was going to resign. \u201cDavid Cameron called me and he informed me that he\u2019s ready to resign,\u201d Tusk said. \u201cI said, \u2018Yes David, it would be very difficult even to imagine that a prime minister who was the leader of remain\u2019s campaign would be just two days later a prime minister negotiating Brexit.\u2019 It was like his day of reckoning was coming, reckoning for his biggest mistake in his life.\u201d In the three-part series for BBC Two, William Hague, George Osborne and Nick Clegg are also interviewed. Osborne, who was chancellor at the time, warned against a gamble that could be a \u201cdisaster for Britain\u201d, but Hague believed there was no other option. \u201cThis was coming. Either we had to lead that or be the victims of it,\u201dHague said. The former French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande discloses how, after dinner during an overnight stay at Chequers in September 2015, he tried to persuade Cameron not to hold the referendum. \u201cNothing obliged him to hold the referendum when he did,\u201d Hollande said. \u201cThis would not be the first time that a commitment made at an election had not been kept afterwards, but he wanted to show he could negotiate successfully with Europeans.\u201d The first part of Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil, \u2018We Quit\u2019, is on Monday 28 January, BBC Two, 9pm.",

It is exhausting, in fact, to spend a whole day in extreme cognitive dissonance about whether or not you want to be in flagrante delicto with a TV presenter, simply because she appeared on your screen that morning. Such is the mind of 24-year-old Marnie, the protagonist in Channel 4\u2019s new primetime drama, Pure.</p> <p>The show explores a young woman\u2019s experience with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/obsessive-compulsive-disorder\">obsessive compulsive disorder</a>. We join Marnie on a journey from a place of frightening inner chaos to a tentatively accepting one, when she is finally able to give a name to the way she thinks.

The focus can be on almost anything tormenting \u2013 violent acts, overwhelming doubts and particularly sexual imagery. It\u2019s the latter that plagues Marnie. Near the start of the series, she tells us she can \u201close an entire day thinking about milking my mum, fingering a horse or getting tea-bagged by my dentist\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7e413b3957b01f1cd1dc09e71e2b1b4c1c3da2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7e413b3957b01f1cd1dc09e71e2b1b4c1c3da2b/0_478_2318_1390/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Pure, a calamitous event at her parents\u2019 anniversary prompts Marnie to flee.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Pure, a calamitous event at her parents\u2019 anniversary prompts Marnie to flee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pure was written by another relative newcomer, Kirstie Swain, based on the book of the same name by Rose Cartwright. The book came to be after Cartwright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/aug/31/pure-ocd-the-naked-truth\">wrote a piece about living with Pure O for Guardian Weekend in 2013</a>, laying bare the secret inner world she\u2019d occupied for a decade. \u201cPeople with Pure O experience repetitive thoughts, doubts and mental images about things such as sex, blasphemy and murder,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNeedless to say, I don\u2019t feel too \u2018pure\u2019 when I\u2019ve woken every morning for a fortnight to the crystalline thought of assholes.\u201d</p> <p>Swain has used Cartwright\u2019s experiences as a prompt to tell a compelling story about cyclical worrying and the impact it can have on a person\u2019s life; not just in their own head, but also on their relationships with family, friends, lovers and colleagues.<strong> </strong>\u201cA lot of people think that mental health is just about the relationship with yourself, but it colours how you relate to everyone,\u201d says Swain. \u201cMental health is your entire worldview.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdddeb243d7db06ba4a1f7c25864be8dda731e25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdddeb243d7db06ba4a1f7c25864be8dda731e25/0_437_3053_2989/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rose Cartwright \u2026 \u2018I had no idea what was happening to me\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"979\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rose Cartwright \u2026 \u2018I had no idea what was happening to me\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Brownlee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pure took two and a half years to make, including months of research, talking to psychologists, charities and people with OCD. Swain says the show also reflects her own life. \u201cI read the book and said \u2018fuck\u2019 out loud so many times. As a female story about anxiety, there was so much I related to. I have always been an obsessive worrier and was a very anxious child. Rose and I had a similar rural upbringing\u201d \u2013 Swain is from the Scottish Borders, Cartwright from the Black Country. \u201cWe both moved to London to try and find out who we were, and her book really helped me.\u201d</p> <p>As a child, Swain had panic attacks but was \u201ctold for ages\u201d it was epilepsy until, finally, it was suggested she had panic disorder. \u201cPure gave me renewed language to talk about anxiety and made me go to the doctor,\u201d she says. \u201cTo be a part of Rose\u2019s story and get the chance to start a wider conversation is an incredible privilege.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It was important to me that the series was true to my distress \u2013 because, even though I know now I am not the only one, there was a long time that I didn't</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Serenely focused in a plant-heavy nook in her London workspace, Cartwright says that the thought of aspects of herself she kept secret and cloaked in shame for so long playing out on screen feels \u201cdream-like\u201d. No wonder. Living with intrusive thoughts and the endless behaviour modifications they induce can be debilitating. (\u201cWhy did I think that? Do I <em>really</em> want to do that to Lorraine?\u201d Marnie asks herself, after fixating on doing something rather extreme with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/06/lorraine-kelly-i-cringe-when-im-called-a-national-treasure\">Lorraine Kelly</a>.)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxK9_-GZeo4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZxK9_-GZeo4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxK9_-GZeo4\">Watch a trailer for Channel 4\u2019s Pure</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>To question your entire identity on a minute-by-minute basis is a lonely experience. It\u2019s the idea of helping to reduce the sense of isolation that moves Cartwright the most. \u201cWhen I was younger, I had no idea what was happening to me. My thoughts were so obscene and the anxiety I experienced so intense, that it seemed there was no way out.\u201d She contemplated suicide. \u201cI had no idea there would be anyone else like me,\u201d she says.</p> <p>There are. Figures from the charity OCD-UK suggest that <a href=\"https://www.ocduk.org/ocd/\">three quarters of a million people are living with life-affecting OCD in the UK</a>. It is difficult to put a number on Pure O because it is a term used by sufferers rather than a clear clinical distinction, but it is highly likely that, given the taboo nature of many areas of sex and a highly anxious brain\u2019s tendency to fixate on what it \u201cshouldn\u2019t\u201d, many others are living a version of Cartwright\u2019s \u2013 and Marnie\u2019s \u2013 experience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"033eafadb77af4da9d49f74a0bf2dba6afba3699\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/033eafadb77af4da9d49f74a0bf2dba6afba3699/0_0_457_571/400.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I hope teenagers will secretly watch it\u2019 \u2026 screenwriter Kirstie Swain.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I hope teenagers will secretly watch it\u2019 \u2026 screenwriter Kirstie Swain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie Drew/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was important to me that the series was true to my distress \u2013 because, even though I know now I am not the only one, there was a long time that I didn\u2019t.\u201d The fact Pure has been made must be profoundly validating to the younger Cartwright, I suggest. Her eyes glisten. Her voice splinters. \u201cI get emotional every time I talk about this because, yes, like you can\u2019t imagine. The process of making it was very healing.\u201d Cartwright says she is in a good place now and that, although intrusive thoughts are still a part of her life, having therapy has helped her to manage and accept them. Being on hand to guide Marnie through her own experience was, she says, \u201calmost like another kind of exposure therapy\u201d.</p> <p>Pure is warm, sharply-scripted and darkly funny. Marnie\u2019s thoughts, rendered as vignettes of her co-stars engaged in all manner of XXX-rated scenes (at one point she performs cunnilingus on her mum, played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/arabellaweir\">Arabella Weir</a>), toe a knowing line between oh-my-God-I-need-to-cover-my-eyes-now agonising and guffaw-worthy. It\u2019s hard not to laugh when an inscrutable psychiatric doctor starts licking her own armpit.</p> <p>The various situations Marnie finds herself in with her growing gang of London friends are moving and hilarious, too. Most notable is Charlie (played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jul/01/joe-cole-actor-interview-i-was-ready-to-deliver-a-kicking\">Joe Cole</a>, of Black Mirror and Peaky Blinders), a recovering sex addict with a prehistoric flip phone; a product of his porn addiction that detonated his relationship and his career. Marnie meets Charlie when she misguidedly attends a Sex Addicts Anonymous meeting and their two yearning, slightly lost souls make a connection. There is complicated beauty in the way they share the most concealed parts of themselves and find solace.</p> <p>Pure will undoubtedly have a powerful effect on anyone, particularly young people, living with a private torment they don\u2019t feel equipped to share. Society\u2019s conversations about mental health are becoming broader and more nuanced all the time, but there can be no doubting the power of humanising the often gruelling day-to-day reality of living with a mental health problem. Pure feels transgressive enough to grab a young audience while communicating something important. At its heart, Pure\u2019s message is one of hope.<br><br>\u201cWhen I was a teenager I secretly watched things like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/06/how-we-made-queer-as-folk-russell-t-davies\">Queer as Folk</a> and Eurotrash<strong> </strong>in my bedroom,\u201d says Swain. \u201cI hope people do that with this.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine they won\u2019t.</p> <p>\u2022 Pure starts on Channel 4 on 30 January.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Trying to navigate the world with a mind that renders almost everyone you see either naked or engaged in sexual congress is less fun than it may sound. It is exhausting, in fact, to spend a whole day in extreme cognitive dissonance about whether or not you want to be in flagrante delicto with a TV presenter, simply because she appeared on your screen that morning. Such is the mind of 24-year-old Marnie, the protagonist in Channel 4\u2019s new primetime drama, Pure. The show explores a young woman\u2019s experience with obsessive compulsive disorder. We join Marnie on a journey from a place of frightening inner chaos to a tentatively accepting one, when she is finally able to give a name to the way she thinks. After a calamitous event at her parents\u2019 25th wedding anniversary in the Scottish Borders, Marnie \u2013 played by newcomer Charly Clive \u2013 boards a coach to London with nothing in the way of a plan. Marnie lives with a manifestation of OCD nicknamed Pure O, defined by repeated intrusive thoughts that concern either the individual or others around them. The focus can be on almost anything tormenting \u2013 violent acts, overwhelming doubts and particularly sexual imagery. It\u2019s the latter that plagues Marnie. Near the start of the series, she tells us she can \u201close an entire day thinking about milking my mum, fingering a horse or getting tea-bagged by my dentist\u201d. Pure was written by another relative newcomer, Kirstie Swain, based on the book of the same name by Rose Cartwright. The book came to be after Cartwright wrote a piece about living with Pure O for Guardian Weekend in 2013, laying bare the secret inner world she\u2019d occupied for a decade. \u201cPeople with Pure O experience repetitive thoughts, doubts and mental images about things such as sex, blasphemy and murder,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNeedless to say, I don\u2019t feel too \u2018pure\u2019 when I\u2019ve woken every morning for a fortnight to the crystalline thought of assholes.\u201d Swain has used Cartwright\u2019s experiences as a prompt to tell a compelling story about cyclical worrying and the impact it can have on a person\u2019s life; not just in their own head, but also on their relationships with family, friends, lovers and colleagues. \u201cA lot of people think that mental health is just about the relationship with yourself, but it colours how you relate to everyone,\u201d says Swain. \u201cMental health is your entire worldview.\u201d Pure took two and a half years to make, including months of research, talking to psychologists, charities and people with OCD. Swain says the show also reflects her own life. \u201cI read the book and said \u2018fuck\u2019 out loud so many times. As a female story about anxiety, there was so much I related to. I have always been an obsessive worrier and was a very anxious child. Rose and I had a similar rural upbringing\u201d \u2013 Swain is from the Scottish Borders, Cartwright from the Black Country. \u201cWe both moved to London to try and find out who we were, and her book really helped me.\u201d As a child, Swain had panic attacks but was \u201ctold for ages\u201d it was epilepsy until, finally, it was suggested she had panic disorder. \u201cPure gave me renewed language to talk about anxiety and made me go to the doctor,\u201d she says. \u201cTo be a part of Rose\u2019s story and get the chance to start a wider conversation is an incredible privilege.\u201d Serenely focused in a plant-heavy nook in her London workspace, Cartwright says that the thought of aspects of herself she kept secret and cloaked in shame for so long playing out on screen feels \u201cdream-like\u201d. No wonder. Living with intrusive thoughts and the endless behaviour modifications they induce can be debilitating. (\u201cWhy did I think that? Do I really want to do that to Lorraine?\u201d Marnie asks herself, after fixating on doing something rather extreme with Lorraine Kelly.) To question your entire identity on a minute-by-minute basis is a lonely experience. It\u2019s the idea of helping to reduce the sense of isolation that moves Cartwright the most. \u201cWhen I was younger, I had no idea what was happening to me. My thoughts were so obscene and the anxiety I experienced so intense, that it seemed there was no way out.\u201d She contemplated suicide. \u201cI had no idea there would be anyone else like me,\u201d she says. There are. Figures from the charity OCD-UK suggest that three quarters of a million people are living with life-affecting OCD in the UK. It is difficult to put a number on Pure O because it is a term used by sufferers rather than a clear clinical distinction, but it is highly likely that, given the taboo nature of many areas of sex and a highly anxious brain\u2019s tendency to fixate on what it \u201cshouldn\u2019t\u201d, many others are living a version of Cartwright\u2019s \u2013 and Marnie\u2019s \u2013 experience. \u201cIt was important to me that the series was true to my distress \u2013 because, even though I know now I am not the only one, there was a long time that I didn\u2019t.\u201d The fact Pure has been made must be profoundly validating to the younger Cartwright, I suggest. Her eyes glisten. Her voice splinters. \u201cI get emotional every time I talk about this because, yes, like you can\u2019t imagine. The process of making it was very healing.\u201d Cartwright says she is in a good place now and that, although intrusive thoughts are still a part of her life, having therapy has helped her to manage and accept them. Being on hand to guide Marnie through her own experience was, she says, \u201calmost like another kind of exposure therapy\u201d. Pure is warm, sharply-scripted and darkly funny. Marnie\u2019s thoughts, rendered as vignettes of her co-stars engaged in all manner of XXX-rated scenes (at one point she performs cunnilingus on her mum, played by Arabella Weir), toe a knowing line between oh-my-God-I-need-to-cover-my-eyes-now agonising and guffaw-worthy. It\u2019s hard not to laugh when an inscrutable psychiatric doctor starts licking her own armpit. The various situations Marnie finds herself in with her growing gang of London friends are moving and hilarious, too. Most notable is Charlie (played by Joe Cole, of Black Mirror and Peaky Blinders), a recovering sex addict with a prehistoric flip phone; a product of his porn addiction that detonated his relationship and his career. Marnie meets Charlie when she misguidedly attends a Sex Addicts Anonymous meeting and their two yearning, slightly lost souls make a connection. There is complicated beauty in the way they share the most concealed parts of themselves and find solace. Pure will undoubtedly have a powerful effect on anyone, particularly young people, living with a private torment they don\u2019t feel equipped to share. Society\u2019s conversations about mental health are becoming broader and more nuanced all the time, but there can be no doubting the power of humanising the often gruelling day-to-day reality of living with a mental health problem. Pure feels transgressive enough to grab a young audience while communicating something important. At its heart, Pure\u2019s message is one of hope. \u201cWhen I was a teenager I secretly watched things like Queer as Folk and Eurotrash in my bedroom,\u201d says Swain. \u201cI hope people do that with this.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine they won\u2019t. \u2022 Pure starts on Channel 4 on 30 January.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>BLUES MONDAY</strong></h2> <p>As an ice-cool fizzy drink would say, what\u2019s the worst that can happen? By airing his grievances after Chelsea\u2019s tepid defeat at Arsenal and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/19/maurizio-sarri-chelsea-players-extremely-difficult-to-motivate-arsenal\">throwing his players</a> under the nearest King\u2019s Road bus service, Maurizio Sarri has opened up a box-fresh can of worms. It is a move that has ruffled feathers before, one that has all of the decorum and coup de grace of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s attritional public dressing-room wars. It will not affect his players, the Italian says, but it\u2019s hardly going to galvanise an infamously brittle squad. Cue player power revolt part VI? They may have not quite reached the realms of full-blown crisis mode just yet, but losing consecutive games to London rivals hardly gets the juices flowing. Enter Gonzalo Higua\u00edn.</p> <p>Fed up with coaxing the same old faces to the giddy heights of fourth in the Premier League, cigarette-filter-chewing Sarri has booked Higua\u00edn, the striker who he polished at Napoli, in for a medical before completing his worst-kept-secret loan move from Milan, with the Serie A club\u2019s \u20ac35m acquisition of Krzysztof Piatek from Genoa greasing the wheels. Chelsea are now just three tiny points in front of Arsenal, so hopefully Higua\u00edn can summon the appetite for a good-old fashioned Big Cup place race to finish. Well, more hunger than his current lot. \u201cIt is my character,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/20/maurizio-sarri-chelsea-arsenal-straight-talker\">Sarri stressed</a>, presumably stroking his chin. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is risky. These guys have a sensible head on their shoulders, so I don\u2019t think I am risking anything. I said the players are difficult to motivate but by the same token there are players who are sensible, who listen and won\u2019t take it the wrong way.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/20/maurizio-sarri-chelsea-arsenal-straight-talker\">Maurizio Sarri says slamming Chelsea\u2019s players was not a risky move</a> </p> </aside>  <p>David Luiz must be one of the players who can do no wrong, making notes at Sarri\u2019s every word, first one in, last one out and all that. Club captain Gary Cahill and title-winner Victor Moses are both in the bad books, while Cesc F\u00e0bregas and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/21/alvaro-morata-chelsea-atletico-madrid\">now \u00c1lvaro Morata</a> have been politely shown the Stamford Bridge exit. \u201cWhat Sarri has done until now is unbelievable,\u201d David Luiz cheered, \u201cbecause normally a team to understand this philosophy needs one or two years, like Man City and Liverpool, who are playing very well with the ball now. What he has done has been amazing, so we have to try to improve the details. Everybody is with him.\u201d</p> <p>What happens next is the fun part. There will inevitably be an opportunity to \u2013 in unison \u2013 shout the words \u201cdown tools\u201d from the rooftops when Willian frowns, Ross Barkley shakes his head or Olivier Giroud ambles out of the blocks. With his players stuck in staccato, maybe Sarri could lean on Mourinho, who has been busy trousering a reported \u00a360,000 to analyse Watford v Burnley in a shiny Doha studio. Mourinho has got the T-shirt when it comes to infighting and in-house spats, after all. \u201cI think we might even have someone who is capable of embodying the characteristics I have talked about,\u201d Sarri stumbled. \u201cOf course there is always a danger a leader emerges who is a bad leader \u2013 who doesn\u2019t necessarily do the kind of things that I want the team to do. Nevertheless I think we need to change the mentality. I think we have that ability and the characteristics to change.\u201d Bring on Spurs this Thursday.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cI just think he was trying to deflect that they\u2019d drawn 2-2 at home to Preston when they were leading 2-0. Which is fair enough, but it\u2019s just everything since then has made me change my mind a little bit. It\u2019s been a bit of a shambles to be honest but that\u2019s football. I\u2019ve seen it happen to a number of players who just get frozen out and don\u2019t get a look in. They are training on their own in the morning, they get no days off.

It is a move that has ruffled feathers before, one that has all of the decorum and coup de grace of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s attritional public dressing-room wars. It will not affect his players, the Italian says, but it\u2019s hardly going to galvanise an infamously brittle squad. Cue player power revolt part VI? They may have not quite reached the realms of full-blown crisis mode just yet, but losing consecutive games to London rivals hardly gets the juices flowing. Enter Gonzalo Higua\u00edn. Fed up with coaxing the same old faces to the giddy heights of fourth in the Premier League, cigarette-filter-chewing Sarri has booked Higua\u00edn, the striker who he polished at Napoli, in for a medical before completing his worst-kept-secret loan move from Milan, with the Serie A club\u2019s \u20ac35m acquisition of Krzysztof Piatek from Genoa greasing the wheels. Chelsea are now just three tiny points in front of Arsenal, so hopefully Higua\u00edn can summon the appetite for a good-old fashioned Big Cup place race to finish. Well, more hunger than his current lot. \u201cIt is my character,\u201d Sarri stressed, presumably stroking his chin. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is risky. These guys have a sensible head on their shoulders, so I don\u2019t think I am risking anything. I said the players are difficult to motivate but by the same token there are players who are sensible, who listen and won\u2019t take it the wrong way.\u201d David Luiz must be one of the players who can do no wrong, making notes at Sarri\u2019s every word, first one in, last one out and all that. Club captain Gary Cahill and title-winner Victor Moses are both in the bad books, while Cesc F\u00e0bregas and now \u00c1lvaro Morata have been politely shown the Stamford Bridge exit. \u201cWhat Sarri has done until now is unbelievable,\u201d David Luiz cheered, \u201cbecause normally a team to understand this philosophy needs one or two years, like Man City and Liverpool, who are playing very well with the ball now. What he has done has been amazing, so we have to try to improve the details. Everybody is with him.\u201d What happens next is the fun part. There will inevitably be an opportunity to \u2013 in unison \u2013 shout the words \u201cdown tools\u201d from the rooftops when Willian frowns, Ross Barkley shakes his head or Olivier Giroud ambles out of the blocks. With his players stuck in staccato, maybe Sarri could lean on Mourinho, who has been busy trousering a reported \u00a360,000 to analyse Watford v Burnley in a shiny Doha studio. Mourinho has got the T-shirt when it comes to infighting and in-house spats, after all. \u201cI think we might even have someone who is capable of embodying the characteristics I have talked about,\u201d Sarri stumbled. \u201cOf course there is always a danger a leader emerges who is a bad leader \u2013 who doesn\u2019t necessarily do the kind of things that I want the team to do. Nevertheless I think we need to change the mentality. I think we have that ability and the characteristics to change.\u201d Bring on Spurs this Thursday. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI just think he was trying to deflect that they\u2019d drawn 2-2 at home to Preston when they were leading 2-0. Which is fair enough, but it\u2019s just everything since then has made me change my mind a little bit. It\u2019s been a bit of a shambles to be honest but that\u2019s football. I\u2019ve seen it happen to a number of players who just get frozen out and don\u2019t get a look in. They are training on their own in the morning, they get no days off. Basically what happens, the club just want them out, they want them off the wage bill and that\u2019s essentially what happened\u201d \u2013 Ross McCormack\u2019s riposte to Steve Bruce on that old electric gates tale.

Well, he did \u2013 but not quite enough to prevent Djokovic striking another blow for the old guard on Monday night.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a cat-and-a-mouse game for most of the match,\u201d said Djokovic, who won 6-4, 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-3. \u201cThat\u2019s why it was so lengthy. We had rallies of 40, 45 exchanges. It was physically exhausting. His backhand is very, very solid. He didn\u2019t give me much from that side.</p> <p>\u201cThe fourth set he started playing well again. Even though it was three sets to one, it seemed like a five-set match. It was draining physically because you just could not rely on one-two punch tactics.\u201d</p> <p>In just over three hours he secured a place in his 10th Australian quarter\u2011final, this time against Kei Nishikori, whom he has beaten 15 times out of 17.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"879f30c60cdc5c9f8111538985e2622421ea3721\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/879f30c60cdc5c9f8111538985e2622421ea3721/0_99_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kei Nishikori beat Pablo Carreno Busta of Spain in a gruelling five-set match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kei Nishikori beat Pablo Carreno Busta of Spain in a gruelling five-set match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Djokovic said: \u201cKei won another marathon match.

One of the quickest players on the tour.\u201d</p> <p>The Japanese shot-maker, too often cruelly cut down by his physical frailties, had to grind out a five-set win in five hours and five minutes, the longest match of the tournament against Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta. Carre\u00f1o Busta left the court in an ugly mood, feeling hard done by over a close line call. Nishikori was too strong in the champions\u2019 tie-break, though, winning 6-7 (8), 4-6, 7-6 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (10-8).</p> <p>Medvedev, the first Russian to get this far here since Nikolay Davydenko in 2010, arrived with form and confidence, having beaten Andy Murray in two sets in Brisbane, but Djokovic had too many gears for him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/21/serena-williams-clinches-tense-third-set-to-dispatch-world-no1-simona-halep-tennis-australian-open\">Serena Williams too hot for Simona Halep in tense Australian Open battle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Djokovic joked on court after his ordeal:\u201cSince I guess my next opponent is watching, I\u2019m feeling fantastic.

But he will have to muster up a deal of those instincts to keep the remaining pretenders at bay.</p> <p>Tsitsipas \u2013 hailed in an on-court interview by John McEnroe on Sunday as leading the \u201cchanging of the guard\u201d, which did not amuse Federer \u2013 is clearly a wonderful talent, as is Medvedev.

      "bodyText": "If the guard is changing at the summit of tennis, it is doing so slowly and without conviction, as Novak Djokovic steps into the void left by the departure of Roger Federer. After eight days of the fortnight the world No 1 is again instilling fear into his side of the draw, as he lurks \u2013 fit, seasoned and determined \u2013 three matches away from a record seventh Australian Open title. Melbourne (and maybe the tournament) was said to belong to the 20-year-old Greek force of nature, Stefanos Tsitsipas, after he put 37-year-old Federer out of the tournament the previous day, and Daniil Medvedev, a mere 22, would, according to many good judges, give 31-year-old Djokovic plenty to think about in the fourth round. Well, he did \u2013 but not quite enough to prevent Djokovic striking another blow for the old guard on Monday night. \u201cIt was a cat-and-a-mouse game for most of the match,\u201d said Djokovic, who won 6-4, 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-3. \u201cThat\u2019s why it was so lengthy. We had rallies of 40, 45 exchanges. It was physically exhausting. His backhand is very, very solid. He didn\u2019t give me much from that side. \u201cThe fourth set he started playing well again. Even though it was three sets to one, it seemed like a five-set match. It was draining physically because you just could not rely on one-two punch tactics.\u201d In just over three hours he secured a place in his 10th Australian quarter\u2011final, this time against Kei Nishikori, whom he has beaten 15 times out of 17. Djokovic said: \u201cKei won another marathon match. Congratulations to him for fighting back from two sets to love and a break down. He\u2019s a fighter. He\u2019s a very talented player. One of the quickest players on the tour.\u201d The Japanese shot-maker, too often cruelly cut down by his physical frailties, had to grind out a five-set win in five hours and five minutes, the longest match of the tournament against Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta. Carre\u00f1o Busta left the court in an ugly mood, feeling hard done by over a close line call. Nishikori was too strong in the champions\u2019 tie-break, though, winning 6-7 (8), 4-6, 7-6 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (10-8). Medvedev, the first Russian to get this far here since Nikolay Davydenko in 2010, arrived with form and confidence, having beaten Andy Murray in two sets in Brisbane, but Djokovic had too many gears for him. Djokovic joked on court after his ordeal:\u201cSince I guess my next opponent is watching, I\u2019m feeling fantastic. I\u2019ve never felt fresher in my life.\u201d As he flexed his biceps to the amusement of the crowd, there was an echo of the old Djokovic, who would rip apart his shirt in animalistic intent. He is gentler now, he says, more contemplative. But he will have to muster up a deal of those instincts to keep the remaining pretenders at bay. Tsitsipas \u2013 hailed in an on-court interview by John McEnroe on Sunday as leading the \u201cchanging of the guard\u201d, which did not amuse Federer \u2013 is clearly a wonderful talent, as is Medvedev. But the old boys are not going quietly. For most of their fourth-round match on a mild Monday night in the Rod Laver Arena, Medvedev, whose hard, flat hitting resembles the Serb\u2019s, fought for each point as if it were the last, but the quality of the firepower coming at him was such he needed regular places to hide or rest. No such places existed in the first set. He forced a tie-break in the second. There comes a moment in nearly every big tournament when Djokovic finds his inner mongrel, as they say here, the beast he cannot tame, that drives him on to remarkable heights. There were clear signs of it in this match. Earlier, the acknowledged leader of the young lions, Alexander Zverev, was so completely defanged in his match against Milos Raonic he was driven to the most spectacular wrecking of his racket in the second set. It was an exhibition of which Stan Wawrinka would have been proud, if more theatrical. It did him no good at all. On the other side of the net Raonic, one of the game\u2019s cooler customers, waited and slowly took the young German\u2019s high-intensity game to pieces to win 6-1, 6-1, 7-6 (5) in just under two hours. Zverev said of his meltdown: \u201cIt made me feel better. I was very angry, so I let my anger out. In the third set I started to play a bit better, but it was too late.\u201d Raonic said: \u201cThat can have an effect a lot of different ways. If you\u2019re a top guy and you do that against somebody who doesn\u2019t have experience, it might cause them to retreat a little bit. I have faced that situation and I was also ahead at that point, so I was just focusing on myself.\u201d The powerful Canadian, a sleeper in the draw given his intermittent absences from meaningful charges in majors, plays Lucas Pouille, seeded 18, another whose chances have not been discussed widely. Raonic, still only 28, and ranked 17 in the world, has won his three matches against the Frenchman, who lurks on the edge of the seedings at 31, and has a modest slam record, winning 24 of 43 matches, but who did the job when asked here against yet another of McEnroe\u2019s young guards, Borna Coric, winning 6-4 (7), 6-4, 7-5, 7-6 (2) in three and a quarter hours.",

Voters will choose who they believe is best suited to take on Trump and who can appeal to the party\u2019s many constituencies, which include white rural voters, young people, college-educated women and people of color.",

The revelation by the Johannesburg magistrate Mashiane Mathopa sheds light on the apparent determination by the governments of South Africa and Rwanda to repair relations strained by a series of attacks on Rwandan dissidents who have been granted political asylum in South Africa. Karegeya, a former presidential aide who founded a Rwandan opposition political party in exile, was found strangled in a room in the five-star Michelangelo hotel in Johannesburg on 1 January 2014. He had gone there to meet a Rwandan businessman friend, one of four men named in the Randburg court last week as possible perpetrators. Karegeya\u2019s family and opposition colleagues have always blamed the murder on Rwandan intelligence acting on orders from Kagame \u2013 a claim he has vehemently denied. Human rights groups allege Karegeya\u2019s killing appears to form part of a wide-ranging campaign of intimidation and harassment targeting Rwandan opposition politicians, outspoken journalists and civil activists both inside the country and abroad. Halting a scheduled inquest into Karegeya\u2019s death in order to give South African police time to explain their failure to prosecute and account for discrepancies in forensic evidence, Mathopa revealed the existence of a previously unseen letter dated 5 June 2018 sent from the prosecutor\u2019s office to the police unit responsible. \u201cThe latter letter is of vital importance,\u201d he told the court. \u201cIt reads as thus: \u2018The director of public prosecutions remarks as follows: i.

It appears that all the Rwandan suspects left the country in 2014 and returned to Rwanda.

Three months before it was sent, South Africa\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and Kagame announced after a bilateral meeting in Kigali that they were determined to normalise ties. Relations had been soured by Pretoria\u2019s expulsion of three Rwandan diplomats suspected of involvement in the shooting in 2010 of Kayumba Nyamwasa, Rwanda\u2019s former army chief of staff and a co-founder of Karegeya\u2019s opposition party. Mathopa gave South African police 14 days to detail what steps, if any, had been taken to arrest the four suspects in the Karegeya case, \u201csince their whereabouts and their identity are known\u201d. His instructions theoretically pave the way either for a formal extradition request to be lodged with Kigali by the South African authorities or for international arrest warrants to be issued. Asked about Monday\u2019s developments, Rwanda\u2019s high commissioner to South Africa, Vincent Karega, said: \u201cI am not party to discussions in the inquest to know what is being discussed.\u201d Monday\u2019s ruling marks a triumph for the South African activist group AfriForum and the head of its private prosecutions unit, Gerrie Nel, who last week called for the inquest to be suspended, warning of a cover-up. The Karegeya family approached AfriForum for help after becoming frustrated at the years of judicial inaction.

      "bodyText": "A disabled woman was discriminated against when she was unfairly sacked by the Department for Work and Pensions, which behaved in a \u201cperverse\u201d and \u201cblinkered\u201d manner, a judge has found. Isabella Valentine, 38, was employed by the DWP on a programme designed to get vulnerable, long-term unemployed people back into work by nurturing and training apprentices over a 12-month period, bringing them to a point where they could apply for jobs in the usual way. Instead, \u201cinexplicable and strange\u201d disciplinary measures were taken by the DWP after just four days\u2019 sickness that led to Valentine\u2019s dismissal. \u201cI suffer regular migraines that are so severe and unpredictable that I am officially classed as disabled. Because of that and a lack of qualifications, I haven\u2019t been able to find decent employment,\u201d said Valentine. \u201cWhen I was handpicked for this programme, I was so happy. I hoped that I had finally found employers who would let me do a good job while being understanding of the time off I sometimes have to take because of my migraines. \u201cInstead, I was made to feel small and so stressed that my migraines got even worse. Not only were no reasonable adjustments made for my disability as legally required but I was subject to the same strict and unbending rules that permanent employees had to work by.\u201d She added: \u201cMy manager started harassing me on the first day I took off sick because of a migraine. By the fourth day, the department had started disciplinary proceedings and decided to dismiss me. Which it then did.\u201d In his judgment, employment judge Robin Postle said: \u201c[Valentine\u2019s treatment] does beg the question, why, given the nature of why the claimant was put on the course, to try and get her back into the workplace, the [DWP] did not make reasonable adjustments [under the Equality Act 2010], in disregarding migraine absences, or indeed, simply taking no further action. The claimant has suffered unfavourable treatment and she had a disability.\u201d The DWP has been taken to the employment tribunal by staff almost 60 times over claims of disability discrimination in a 20-month period.

The number of allegations made by disabled staff is surprising because the DWP is responsible for the much-criticised Disability Confident scheme, which aims to help employers recruit and retain disabled employees. DWP claims to be a Disability Confident \u201cleader\u201d, the highest of the scheme\u2019s three levels. Valentine\u2019s manager was told she would require extra support and leeway to enable her to complete the course. The Suffolk Law Centre solicitor Carol Ward who fought the case as part of the National Lottery Reaching Communities-funded project Tackling Discrimination in the East, said: \u201cThe behaviour of the DWP was particularly inexplicable and strange because the whole point of the course was to help the apprentices who struggled to cope in the workplace. \u201cThe claimant had been personally chosen by a DWP work coach.

A third manager who conducted Valentine\u2019s appeal failed to do basic checks on the considerable leeway that had been granted to many other apprentices on the same course. The consequence was a \u201cpredetermined decision\u201d to dismiss Valentine before she had even returned from her second period of sick leave. \u201cThis was particularly surprising given the fact that [one of the managers said] it became clear very quickly that this was a group of people who needed a lot of support as they were not used to the working environment and needed support to help them cope,\u201d said the judge.

ID3334123 recommends the Beastie Boys Book by Mike D and Ad Rock: By turns joyful, hilarious and moving, often all three at once. Utterly life-affirming in its grin-inducing energy. A Month In The Country by JL Carr has provided similar sustenance for roadwaterlady: Such a delight to read \u2013 like the first mouthful of freshly baked cake, still slightly warm and fruity, quietly infusing one with peaceful acceptance, for as Tom finds his way so do we. The great Marcel Proust has held alexandra1108 \u201chooked\u201d since last summer: This week I started the last volume, Le temps retrouv\u00e9 \u2026 Sad that this adventure will soon end but immensely happy that there is more Proust to read and that I can start the Recherche any time again when I feel like it.

Joseph Heller\u2019s Catch 22 is another \u201cgood book to read in these times of collective insanity,\u201d according to ShouldBeEven, who has been intending to read the book for \u201cover twenty years\u201d: I picked up a second copy for three quid from Fopp just before Christmas and it was worth the wait. The final 200 pages are incredible. Yossarian\u2019s Christ-like night walk through Rome stands out in this blackest of comedies. Krestinsky says that Heller\u2019s Something Happens may be \u201ceven better\u201d: It\u2019s interesting in a John Cheever kind of way, although even more jaundiced and cynical. Time for some science fiction. A Far has just finished Children of Time by Adrian Tchaikovsky: Fantastic, fun and intelligent science fiction. Themes we\u2019ve seen before but written in a pretty unique way\u2026 I discovered it as Tom Hanks recommended it on Twitter. This is my first Hanks recommended read. So far he has an excellent recommendation success rate with me. BullRob has another good one on the go: I\u2019ve just started Cixin Liu\u2019s The Dark Forest having previously read and enjoyed his The Three-Body Problem. Fascinating writing from the leading Chinese author of science fiction. And Brian Catling\u2019s Vorrh trilogy has impressed gimlisonofgloin: Amazing.

Finally, Devenish is \u201csavouring every word\u201d of WG Sebald\u2019s Austerlitz: All the time there\u2019s the heavy, slightly sinister air. There\u2019s something so perfect about the way he writes, not a single unrequired word or comma out of place. Sebald so perfectly suits the times we live in. Like when I read JG Farrell\u2019s Singapore Grip, there\u2019s a sense of sadness knowing that this is it \u2013 this is the last one. We all know that sadness \u2013 but at least it also makes the books feel even more like a gift. Interesting links about books and reading 75 writers write a response to 75 archive poetry recordings from the 92Y Unterberg Poetry Center. The Long Island outpost where John Steinbeck and Truman Capote took refuge. Lou Marinoff on \u201cThe Monster of Malmesbury\u201d, Thomas Hobbes. James Wolcott on The Life of Saul Bellow, \u201cthe authorised and definitive biography that groans with the graven heft of stone tablets.\u201d If you\u2019re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #GuardianBooks, and we\u2019ll include a selection in this blog.

Mike Veale, the chief constable of Cleveland police, had been under pressure since a police watchdog investigation found in September that he had lied about a smashed mobile phone. But on Monday, Barry Coppinger, the Cleveland police and crime commissioner, said he had been made aware of allegations of a \u201cserious nature\u201d that had been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Coppinger gave no more detail on the allegations, but said Veale had resigned with immediate effect on Friday. His resignation came months after Veale apologised after the IOPC found he had lied about how he had broken his work phone. Veale told colleagues he had smashed the device when he dropped it in a car park and it was run over. But an investigation discovered he had destroyed the phone when he played a poor shot during a round of golf and hit his bag with a club in frustration. The IOPC investigation was launched after anonymous claims \u2013 later found not proven \u2013 that he had smashed his police-issue phone to hide contacts with \u201cvarious parties\u201d during the Heath inquiry. The IOPC concluded Veale had a case to answer for misconduct for providing an inaccurate account of the incident, but Coppinger chose to resolve the case with \u201cmanagement action\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Jorge Molina set out in an old Seat 850, sitting proudly behind the wheel of a car that hadn\u2019t come off the production line for 30 years and shuddered as it made its way down the road, so the journey was bound to take a while. It\u2019s a long way from Alcoyano to Europe and the verge of the national team, after all, but he\u2019s nearly there now. Looking up from the bottom of <em>tercera</em> division, the place where it all began around the turn of the century, 466 teams stand between you and the very top; looking up from the place where he and his team are this morning, almost 20 years on, long after he should have left, just five do. As for Molina himself, no one stands before him any more. That, at least, was the verdict of the Getafe fans this weekend.</p> \n<p>A qualified teacher with a degree in PE, coaching badges and his sporting director\u2019s licence, the man teammates say seems shy but does a great impression of the boss, supporters reckon Jorge Molina is qualified to play for Spain too. Which perhaps they would, but that doesn\u2019t make them wrong. As he departed on Friday night with Getafe on course for a 4-0 win over Alav\u00e9s, first he was handed a standing ovation and then he was serenaded, a song starting, \u201cJorge, <em>selecci\u00f3n</em>!\u201d running around the Coliseum and welcomed by everyone except maybe the man himself. Asked about it afterwards, he blushed a little, smiled awkwardly, almost laughed and looked away, as if embarrassed. \u201cNah,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice, and I\u2019m happy, but that\u2019s all. Let\u2019s be realistic: I\u2019m of an age now \u2026\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jan/21/serie-a-returns-with-a-reminder-that-it-can-be-beautiful-too\">Serie A returns with a reminder that it can be beautiful too | Paolo Bandini</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Molina is of an age when most players have stopped altogether. The next time Spain play will be the day before his 37th birthday. And yet the song was not so silly. \u201cI didn\u2019t sing, no, it was just the fans,\u201d Getafe\u2019s manager, Pepe Bordal\u00e1s, said, \u201cbut he\u2019s in a fantastic moment.\u201d Look at the strikers who went the World Cup in the summer: Iago Aspas is easily the best with 10 goals, but he\u2019s injured; this weekend Rodrigo scored his third of the season, relief engulfing him; and Diego Costa, injured again, has just one. Right now, it\u2019s not a huge stretch to claim that Molina is better than them, nor is it unrealistic to suggest he could contribute if he got the call. Certainly, no less realistic than suggesting that he would still be here, still doing this, in 2019. Or maybe even suggesting that he would get there at all.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s been a long journey, beginning in 2001 at Alcoyano in the fourth tier, with its 18 separate divisions and 360 teams, driving to training in his indestructible Seat. He has got there via three promotions, two relegations, over 500 league games and more than 200 league goals, most of them scored down in the depths where he says they really do kick you, and to where he resists returning. A place where he studied while he trained, sure that this wasn\u2019t going to last long, only to be proven wrong. Eventually.</p> \n<p>After Alcoyano, came Gand\u00eda. Then Benidorm and Poli Egido in the four-division, 80-team <em>Segunda B</em>, and not for one season, passing through: Molina spent as many years there as he has in the <em>primera</em>. He was top scorer in the second division with Elche, and got 18 there the following season, 2010-11, for Betis. But still he hadn\u2019t reached the first division: he was coming up to his 30th birthday when he made his debut in <em>primera</em> that autumn. Now he\u2019s back again and better than ever. He played over 100 first division matches for Betis, made seven appearances in Europe too, became a fan favourite, but since then he had been relegated and released. He left Betis after six years, the Molina model they made for him melting in his hot car, and most assumed it was all over. He\u2019d scored 19 to bring Betis up, but just one in the first division, and when he joined Getafe in 2016, it was on a free transfer and back down a division.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Getafe were a second division side \u2013 his place, many said \u2013 but not for long. He scored 20 to bring them up. Back in the first division, aged 35, he scored seven, in a team that was far from attacking. On Friday night, midway through his second season, in which he has played every game, he scored two against Alav\u00e9s, the first a belter maybe even better than his wonderful strike at Villarreal last week. Receiving with his back to goal, he turned and thumped in a rocket from 20 yards, out of nothing. Not long after, he appeared in the area, to lift a shot over Fernando Pachecho. That took him to eight for the season and Getafe closer to a win that strengthened their barely believable hold on the final European spot, just one point behind Alav\u00e9s and two behind Sevilla.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e6d78c60c4677b5d241f33dccb1e8b45c189264b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6d78c60c4677b5d241f33dccb1e8b45c189264b/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Getafe celebrate after Jaime Mata\u2019s goal against Alav\u00e9s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Getafe celebrate after Jaime Mata\u2019s goal against Alav\u00e9s.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shot for Press/Action Plus via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Nor is it really about the goals.

      "bodyText": "Jorge Molina set out in an old Seat 850, sitting proudly behind the wheel of a car that hadn\u2019t come off the production line for 30 years and shuddered as it made its way down the road, so the journey was bound to take a while. It\u2019s a long way from Alcoyano to Europe and the verge of the national team, after all, but he\u2019s nearly there now. Looking up from the bottom of tercera division, the place where it all began around the turn of the century, 466 teams stand between you and the very top; looking up from the place where he and his team are this morning, almost 20 years on, long after he should have left, just five do. As for Molina himself, no one stands before him any more. That, at least, was the verdict of the Getafe fans this weekend. A qualified teacher with a degree in PE, coaching badges and his sporting director\u2019s licence, the man teammates say seems shy but does a great impression of the boss, supporters reckon Jorge Molina is qualified to play for Spain too. Which perhaps they would, but that doesn\u2019t make them wrong. As he departed on Friday night with Getafe on course for a 4-0 win over Alav\u00e9s, first he was handed a standing ovation and then he was serenaded, a song starting, \u201cJorge, selecci\u00f3n!\u201d running around the Coliseum and welcomed by everyone except maybe the man himself. Asked about it afterwards, he blushed a little, smiled awkwardly, almost laughed and looked away, as if embarrassed. \u201cNah,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice, and I\u2019m happy, but that\u2019s all. Let\u2019s be realistic: I\u2019m of an age now \u2026\u201d Molina is of an age when most players have stopped altogether. The next time Spain play will be the day before his 37th birthday. And yet the song was not so silly. \u201cI didn\u2019t sing, no, it was just the fans,\u201d Getafe\u2019s manager, Pepe Bordal\u00e1s, said, \u201cbut he\u2019s in a fantastic moment.\u201d Look at the strikers who went the World Cup in the summer: Iago Aspas is easily the best with 10 goals, but he\u2019s injured; this weekend Rodrigo scored his third of the season, relief engulfing him; and Diego Costa, injured again, has just one. Right now, it\u2019s not a huge stretch to claim that Molina is better than them, nor is it unrealistic to suggest he could contribute if he got the call. Certainly, no less realistic than suggesting that he would still be here, still doing this, in 2019. Or maybe even suggesting that he would get there at all. It\u2019s been a long journey, beginning in 2001 at Alcoyano in the fourth tier, with its 18 separate divisions and 360 teams, driving to training in his indestructible Seat. He has got there via three promotions, two relegations, over 500 league games and more than 200 league goals, most of them scored down in the depths where he says they really do kick you, and to where he resists returning. A place where he studied while he trained, sure that this wasn\u2019t going to last long, only to be proven wrong. Eventually. After Alcoyano, came Gand\u00eda. Then Benidorm and Poli Egido in the four-division, 80-team Segunda B, and not for one season, passing through: Molina spent as many years there as he has in the primera. He was top scorer in the second division with Elche, and got 18 there the following season, 2010-11, for Betis. But still he hadn\u2019t reached the first division: he was coming up to his 30th birthday when he made his debut in primera that autumn. Now he\u2019s back again and better than ever. He played over 100 first division matches for Betis, made seven appearances in Europe too, became a fan favourite, but since then he had been relegated and released. He left Betis after six years, the Molina model they made for him melting in his hot car, and most assumed it was all over. He\u2019d scored 19 to bring Betis up, but just one in the first division, and when he joined Getafe in 2016, it was on a free transfer and back down a division. Getafe were a second division side \u2013 his place, many said \u2013 but not for long. He scored 20 to bring them up. Back in the first division, aged 35, he scored seven, in a team that was far from attacking. On Friday night, midway through his second season, in which he has played every game, he scored two against Alav\u00e9s, the first a belter maybe even better than his wonderful strike at Villarreal last week. Receiving with his back to goal, he turned and thumped in a rocket from 20 yards, out of nothing. Not long after, he appeared in the area, to lift a shot over Fernando Pachecho. That took him to eight for the season and Getafe closer to a win that strengthened their barely believable hold on the final European spot, just one point behind Alav\u00e9s and two behind Sevilla. Nor is it really about the goals. In the cold under the main stand on Friday night, one admiring opponent blew out his cheeks. \u201cJorge \u2026\u201d he said, saying it all.

The things I admire and that interest me in his paintings are not perhaps the things he fully intended. Aspects of his work that others find charming or life-affirming I soon weary of. All that colour, all that fidgety brushwork. His figures are very hit-and-miss, sometimes crude and absurd; sometimes the distortions seem terrific, at other times horrible. I can\u2019t bear the way one naked female leg is always warm, the other always cool, and why Bonnard teases the viewer with one female nipple always being in stark profile. He can be monumental, he can be scrappy. Faces in the crowd are often monstrous or ill-formed. Bonnard did not have a facile talent: he had to work at things.

I suppose he might have been right, and his remark may have had something to do with why I am no longer a painter, but I doubt it.

G4S was stripped of its contract to run Medway STC the day the Guardian published its expos\u00e9.</p> <p>Now the serious case review, published by Medway Safeguarding Children Board, has highlighted the toothlessness of the children\u2019s charity commissioned by the YJB in 2013 to deliver advocacy services across the young people\u2019s secure estate of England and Wales. As advocates, Barnardo\u2019s responsibility was to debrief inmates after they had been restrained and ensure they had not been abused.</p> <p>But the review revealed that Barnardo\u2019s did not even have an office in Medway, that when Barnardo\u2019s advocates did escalate safeguarding concerns Medway had no requirement to update them on the outcome, and that it had no right to independently contact the local authority designated officer (Lado) responsible for responding to allegations made by children against members of staff.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/26/former-medway-inmate-the-guard-slammed-my-face-off-the-ice\">Former Medway inmate: 'The guard slammed my face off the ice'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The review concluded: \u201cThe contract between the YJB and Barnardo\u2019s was a barrier to independent scrutiny.\u201d It was only in 2017 that the contract was changed to allow Barnardo\u2019s to contact the Lado directly if it had concerns about a member of staff. The contract was also changed so that Barnardo\u2019s staff do not have to be physically present to offer advocacy if a young person has previously been restrained in Medway STC.</p> <p>The review also revealed:</p> <ul> <li><p>Before 2016 staff had picked on vulnerable children. \u201cThis included children who did not speak English or were comparatively young or withdrawn or had no extremal family support.\u201d</p></li> <li><p>Ninety children were taken to A&amp;E from Medway STC during the three-year period under review.</p></li> <li><p>The reporting of alleged crimes by members of staff against children at Medway STC was described as \u201cstymied\u201d.</p></li> <li><p>After the Panorama programme, 16 members of staff were arrested, nine were charged but none were convicted.</p></li> <li><p>Many children did not pursue allegations of abuse by members of staff because they had no faith in the investigating agencies.</p></li> <li><p>G4S did not hand over locally stored staff records and local supervision records when Her Majesty\u2019s Prison and Probation Service took over the management of the centre.</p></li> <li><p>The local authority designated officer, responsible for monitoring and overseeing investigations against staff working with children, was \u201cerratic and ineffective\u201d, focusing on proving whether allegations could be substantiated rather than the potential risk of staff members to children.</p></li> <li><p>Medway Safeguarding Children Board\u2019s failure to analyse allegations was \u201ca missed opportunity for challenge\u201d.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>The YJB\u2019s focus on contract compliance did not \u201cenable judgments to be focused primarily on children\u2019s safety\u201d.</p></li> </ul> <p>Carolyne Willow, whose charity, <a href=\"https://article39.org.uk/\">Article 39</a>, fights for the rights of children in institutional settings, said: \u201cThis review confirms what millions of us watched on the BBC Panorama programme: that G4S failed to protect children. The new revelation is that the local systems for protecting children in this institution were utterly ineffective.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Barnardo\u2019s said: \u201cThe safety and wellbeing of all children is of paramount importance to Barnardo\u2019s. We welcome the recommendations made by the serious case review and will continue to work closely with the Ministry of Justice, Youth Custody Service, Youth Justice Board and stakeholders to ensure all children can access our independent [advocacy] service.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the YJB said: \u201cThe Youth Justice Board has made significant changes since January 2016. Following a transfer of operational and commissioning responsibility to the Youth Custody Service and Ministry of Justice, the Youth Justice Board is now able to focus on its statutory duty \u2013 monitoring and improving the youth justice system as a whole. The Youth Justice Board now actively promotes a \u2018child first\u2019 approach within the youth justice sector, demanding that all those under 18 are treated as children.\u201d</p> <p>Jerry Petherick, the managing director of G4S custodial and detention services, said: \u201cThe behaviour of some of our staff at Medway in 2016 was completely unacceptable, and in stark contrast to our training and values. The wellbeing of those in our care is of the highest priority.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A review into the alleged abuse of children by staff at a children\u2019s prison has found that a series of failings led to an \u201cerratic and ineffective\u201d monitoring of investigations into the claims. The serious case review criticises a contract between the Youth Justice Board (YJB) and Barnardo\u2019s, which was acting as an independent advocate for the children, that \u201cexpressly did not allow\u201d the charity to refer concerns about child protection to the local authority responsible for their welfare. The review into Medway secure training centre was undertaken in 2016 after an undercover Panorama documentary alleged staff at the centre, then run by the security firm G4S, appeared to be mistreating and abusing inmates, and boasting about using inappropriate techniques to restrain children. Other allegations included staff trying to hide their actions by ensuring they were in areas not covered by CCTV cameras. A subsequent investigation by the Guardian revealed a history of abuse allegations at the centre in Rochester, Kent, and that a letter sent by two whistleblowers 12 years earlier to the YJB, G4S, the Social Services Inspectorate and a Home Office minister had been ignored. G4S was stripped of its contract to run Medway STC the day the Guardian published its expos\u00e9. Now the serious case review, published by Medway Safeguarding Children Board, has highlighted the toothlessness of the children\u2019s charity commissioned by the YJB in 2013 to deliver advocacy services across the young people\u2019s secure estate of England and Wales. As advocates, Barnardo\u2019s responsibility was to debrief inmates after they had been restrained and ensure they had not been abused. But the review revealed that Barnardo\u2019s did not even have an office in Medway, that when Barnardo\u2019s advocates did escalate safeguarding concerns Medway had no requirement to update them on the outcome, and that it had no right to independently contact the local authority designated officer (Lado) responsible for responding to allegations made by children against members of staff. The review concluded: \u201cThe contract between the YJB and Barnardo\u2019s was a barrier to independent scrutiny.\u201d It was only in 2017 that the contract was changed to allow Barnardo\u2019s to contact the Lado directly if it had concerns about a member of staff. The contract was also changed so that Barnardo\u2019s staff do not have to be physically present to offer advocacy if a young person has previously been restrained in Medway STC. The review also revealed: Before 2016 staff had picked on vulnerable children. \u201cThis included children who did not speak English or were comparatively young or withdrawn or had no extremal family support.\u201d Ninety children were taken to A&amp;E from Medway STC during the three-year period under review. The reporting of alleged crimes by members of staff against children at Medway STC was described as \u201cstymied\u201d. After the Panorama programme, 16 members of staff were arrested, nine were charged but none were convicted. Many children did not pursue allegations of abuse by members of staff because they had no faith in the investigating agencies. G4S did not hand over locally stored staff records and local supervision records when Her Majesty\u2019s Prison and Probation Service took over the management of the centre. The local authority designated officer, responsible for monitoring and overseeing investigations against staff working with children, was \u201cerratic and ineffective\u201d, focusing on proving whether allegations could be substantiated rather than the potential risk of staff members to children. Medway Safeguarding Children Board\u2019s failure to analyse allegations was \u201ca missed opportunity for challenge\u201d. The YJB\u2019s focus on contract compliance did not \u201cenable judgments to be focused primarily on children\u2019s safety\u201d. Carolyne Willow, whose charity, Article 39, fights for the rights of children in institutional settings, said: \u201cThis review confirms what millions of us watched on the BBC Panorama programme: that G4S failed to protect children. The new revelation is that the local systems for protecting children in this institution were utterly ineffective.\u201d A spokesperson for Barnardo\u2019s said: \u201cThe safety and wellbeing of all children is of paramount importance to Barnardo\u2019s. We welcome the recommendations made by the serious case review and will continue to work closely with the Ministry of Justice, Youth Custody Service, Youth Justice Board and stakeholders to ensure all children can access our independent [advocacy] service.\u201d A spokesperson for the YJB said: \u201cThe Youth Justice Board has made significant changes since January 2016. Following a transfer of operational and commissioning responsibility to the Youth Custody Service and Ministry of Justice, the Youth Justice Board is now able to focus on its statutory duty \u2013 monitoring and improving the youth justice system as a whole. The Youth Justice Board now actively promotes a \u2018child first\u2019 approach within the youth justice sector, demanding that all those under 18 are treated as children.\u201d Jerry Petherick, the managing director of G4S custodial and detention services, said: \u201cThe behaviour of some of our staff at Medway in 2016 was completely unacceptable, and in stark contrast to our training and values. The wellbeing of those in our care is of the highest priority.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Nicaragua\u2019s best-known journalist has gone into exile after armed police raided and ransacked his newsroom in what experts called the latest chapter of the country\u2019s slide into autocracy under President Daniel Ortega. Carlos Fernando Chamorro, the editor of Confidencial, a combative newsletter and website and a member of one of Nicaragua\u2019s most influential families, announced his decision on Sunday. Chamorro wrote: \u201cI will continue to fulfil my duties as a journalist from Costa Rica \u2026 investigating and denouncing the crimes, corruption and the impunity and documenting the terminal crisis of this dictatorship.\u201d He blamed his decision on the \u201cextreme threats\u201d he and other Nicaraguan journalists were facing as a result of an intensifying press crackdown being waged by the country\u2019s Sandinista leader. He claimed leaving Nicaragua \u2013 where Ortega has been struggling to regain control since a destabilising and deadly period of political upheaval began last April \u2013 was the only way to ensure his \u201cphysical integrity and freedom\u201d. Throughout Nicaragua\u2019s ongoing crisis, Chamorro has repeatedly insisted he would not be forced from the country. \u201cI\u2019m here and here I will remain,\u201d he told the Guardian last month after his offices in the capital, Managua, were stormed and occupied by police. However, the assault on the media has continued to gather pace despite international condemnation. A week after the raid on Chamorro\u2019s offices, another channel, 100% Noticias, was stormed and two of its directors taken into custody, where they remain. The Committee to Protect Journalists labelled the operations \u201can unacceptable escalation of the Nicaraguan government\u2019s crackdown on the country\u2019s independent media\u201d. Last week, Nicaragua\u2019s biggest newspaper, La Prensa, printed an almost blank front page in protest at the government\u2019s apparent attempt to silence it by impounding printing materials. Readers used marker pens and pencils to write their own headlines into the empty space in a viral social media campaign that used the hashtag #LaPrensaChallenge. Suggested front-page headlines included: \u201cThey want to silence us but you can\u2019t silence the truth\u201d, \u201cSOS Nicaragua\u201d and \u201cNicaragua declares itself a territory free of Orteguismo\u201d. Another headline celebrated the nine-month-old anti-Ortega movement with the rallying cry: \u201cInsist, persist, resist and never desist!\u201d In the article announcing his exile, Chamorro called on Nicaraguan citizens to continue using social media to challenge Ortega and vowed to continue his own journalism from Costa Rica, home to a sizeable and growing Nicaraguan exile community. \u201cI am confident that better days lie ahead for Nicaragua,\u201d he wrote.",

The details of the case appear in court documents revealing that the Home Office successfully won an appeal against a ruling that the baby and his mother, a Nigerian national, had been falsely imprisoned on the grounds that the burden of proof rested on the boy to prove his citizenship. The mother, referred to in documents as TR, and her son, named as JA, were held in immigration detention for 12 days after an asylum application by TR was rejected. The Immigration Advisory Service (IAS) wrote to the Home Office saying JA was a British citizen through his father and, to prove this, efforts were being made to update his birth certificate. It was submitted that, as a British citizen, JA could not be removed and TR should be permitted to remain in the UK to care for him. The Home Office rejected the representations and detained mother and son. Ultimately, the high court granted a stay of removal and TR and JA were released. A month later, JA\u2019s British father was added to his birth certificate. Following a trial at the central London county court, TR and JA were awarded \u00a320,000 and \u00a35,000 respectively for false imprisonment. However, the Home Office appealed against this decision in the high court on the grounds that the judge made an error of law by concluding that JA could not lawfully be detained because he was a British citizen. Mrs Justice Judith Farbey QC, in a ruling published on Thursday, ruled in favour of the Home Office as at the time of JA\u2019s detention it was not proven that he was a British citizen and therefore there were reasonable grounds to suspect he could be removed. She said: \u201cIf a person\u2019s citizenship is in question, the burden lies on him to prove that he is British in order to avoid the risk of loss of liberty under the 1971 act.\u201d However, Farbey also allowed a cross appeal after Amanda Weston QC, representing the family, argued that if there was no power to remove JA as a British citizen and he was being breastfed there was no prospect of removing his mother. The judge directed that the case must return to a lower court and be heard again for a fresh decision. The child is now nine. His mother arrived in the UK on 6 October 2007 and was granted leave to enter until 9 January 2008. She overstayed her leave and remained in the UK. JA was born in September 2009. Initially his birth certificate showed TR as his mother but the father\u2019s details were not registered. On 23 October 2009, TR applied for asylum and on 12 January 2010, the Home Office rejected the application and refused to grant humanitarian protection. The IAS submitted its representations in April 2010 but the mother and son were detained on 9 May 2010 until 21 May that year. The county court hearing was held in October 2017 and the appeal was held in October last year.",

Mortality rates for all cancers in the age group have fallen by almost a third, from 42.9 per million in 2001 to 32.3 per million in 2015. Five-year survival rates have risen by four percentage points (from 83% in females/80% males in 2001-05 to 87% females/84% males in the 2007-11 period).</p> <p>It\u2019s hugely welcome news \u2013 as is NHS England\u2019s recognition of the need to prioritise young people with cancer in its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/07/the-guardian-view-on-the-nhs-long-term-plan-a-vision-in-need-of-staff\" title=\"\">long-term plan announced last week</a>, including the goal of 50% of young people having access to clinical trials by 2025. Clinical trials, which give participants access to new forms of treatment, are generally considered a marker of high-quality care. Teens and young adults have historically been under-represented in such trials, while children have a much higher participation rate, which is thought to be one reason for the impressive advances in child cancer survival rates.</p> <p>But we can\u2019t be complacent \u2013 there is still so much more to be done. The report shows that young cancer patients from deprived areas have significantly lower five-year survival rates than their more privileged peers (survival for patients from the most deprived areas is 84%, as opposed to 88% for patients from the least deprived areas). More research is urgently needed to find out why so that these inequalities can be addressed: no young person should face a worse prognosis because of their background.</p> <p>There is also an urgent need for more support for teenagers and young adults throughout their cancer treatment and beyond. Currently only about half of all young cancer patients are treated on one of <a href=\"https://www.teenagecancertrust.org/about-us/what-we-do/cancer-units\" title=\"\">TCT\u2019s 28 hospitals units</a>, where they receive care from specialist nurses and counsellors. Although National Institute for Health and Care Excellence directives state that all young people under 19 must be cared for in age-appropriate facilities, and those over 19 should also have unhindered access to age-appropriate facilities and support when needed, in reality this often isn\u2019t the case. Many teenagers feel isolated on children\u2019s wards with crying babies; young adults are often treated on general cancer wards, as I was, surrounded by elderly patients and constant bereavement.</p> <p>Too many of us \u2013 half of all 13-24-year-olds with cancer, according to a 2018 TCT report \u2013 have no access to psychological support. After I was told that my leukaemia was more aggressive than doctors originally thought, I asked my consultant if I could speak to a counsellor. At the time I was undergoing high-dose chemotherapy while I waited desperately for a matching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/feb/02/stem-cell-donation-make-friend-save-life\" title=\"\">stem-cell donor</a> to be found. I felt trapped in a body that seemed determined to self-destruct; I was overwhelmed by anxiety and terrified of dying. I told my consultant I was struggling to sleep. He said there weren\u2019t any counsellors \u2013 in a major London hospital \u2013 and offered to write a prescription for sleeping pills instead.</p> <p>In 2018, I finally celebrated my five-year-survival milestone. I\u2019m thrilled, but I\u2019m also worn out \u2013 the end of cancer treatment was just the beginning of a complicated recovery and often a battle to get urgent medical care. For many of us young survivors, it\u2019s easy to feel like a ticked box in the eyes of the health system and the world around us, while we mourn lost opportunities and struggle to recover a semblance of normality. Long-term side-effects from treatment, such as pain, fatigue and compromised immunity, can seriously harm our chances of returning to work or studies. A survey by the <a href=\"https://www.clicsargent.org.uk/young-people-with-cancer-arent-getting-the-support-they-need/\" title=\"\">CLIC Sargent charity</a> for children and young adults with cancer suggested that many young adults were unable to work or even find work long after their diagnosis, with a quarter of participants reporting that their employer had not made the adjustments they needed at work.</p> <p>Ultimately, we need more government investment, to increase access to clinical trials as well as develop specialist support for teens and young adults. Education providers and employers also need to do their bit \u2013 whether that\u2019s offering a young person the chance to work part time for a job listed as full time \u2013 or accepting an applicant with slightly lower exam grades because they were going through treatment at the time. It\u2019s in their own interests to do so because young cancer survivors have many valuable skills. And as an interviewee once told me: \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been in a hospital bed next to someone dying of a stroke, it shows employers you know how to handle a crisis.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Hannah Partos is a freelance journalist</p>",

Clinical trials, which give participants access to new forms of treatment, are generally considered a marker of high-quality care. Teens and young adults have historically been under-represented in such trials, while children have a much higher participation rate, which is thought to be one reason for the impressive advances in child cancer survival rates. But we can\u2019t be complacent \u2013 there is still so much more to be done. The report shows that young cancer patients from deprived areas have significantly lower five-year survival rates than their more privileged peers (survival for patients from the most deprived areas is 84%, as opposed to 88% for patients from the least deprived areas). More research is urgently needed to find out why so that these inequalities can be addressed: no young person should face a worse prognosis because of their background. There is also an urgent need for more support for teenagers and young adults throughout their cancer treatment and beyond. Currently only about half of all young cancer patients are treated on one of TCT\u2019s 28 hospitals units, where they receive care from specialist nurses and counsellors. Although National Institute for Health and Care Excellence directives state that all young people under 19 must be cared for in age-appropriate facilities, and those over 19 should also have unhindered access to age-appropriate facilities and support when needed, in reality this often isn\u2019t the case. Many teenagers feel isolated on children\u2019s wards with crying babies; young adults are often treated on general cancer wards, as I was, surrounded by elderly patients and constant bereavement. Too many of us \u2013 half of all 13-24-year-olds with cancer, according to a 2018 TCT report \u2013 have no access to psychological support. After I was told that my leukaemia was more aggressive than doctors originally thought, I asked my consultant if I could speak to a counsellor. At the time I was undergoing high-dose chemotherapy while I waited desperately for a matching stem-cell donor to be found. I felt trapped in a body that seemed determined to self-destruct; I was overwhelmed by anxiety and terrified of dying. I told my consultant I was struggling to sleep. He said there weren\u2019t any counsellors \u2013 in a major London hospital \u2013 and offered to write a prescription for sleeping pills instead. In 2018, I finally celebrated my five-year-survival milestone. I\u2019m thrilled, but I\u2019m also worn out \u2013 the end of cancer treatment was just the beginning of a complicated recovery and often a battle to get urgent medical care. For many of us young survivors, it\u2019s easy to feel like a ticked box in the eyes of the health system and the world around us, while we mourn lost opportunities and struggle to recover a semblance of normality. Long-term side-effects from treatment, such as pain, fatigue and compromised immunity, can seriously harm our chances of returning to work or studies. A survey by the CLIC Sargent charity for children and young adults with cancer suggested that many young adults were unable to work or even find work long after their diagnosis, with a quarter of participants reporting that their employer had not made the adjustments they needed at work. Ultimately, we need more government investment, to increase access to clinical trials as well as develop specialist support for teens and young adults. Education providers and employers also need to do their bit \u2013 whether that\u2019s offering a young person the chance to work part time for a job listed as full time \u2013 or accepting an applicant with slightly lower exam grades because they were going through treatment at the time. It\u2019s in their own interests to do so because young cancer survivors have many valuable skills. And as an interviewee once told me: \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been in a hospital bed next to someone dying of a stroke, it shows employers you know how to handle a crisis.\u201d \u2022 Hannah Partos is a freelance journalist",

He can\u2019t take the first, though, sending a backhand return long. Medvedev saves the second with a backhand into the open court. Not the third, though. An inside-out forehand from Djokovic is too good. It\u2019s all over. The pair meet at the net and have a good-natured chat about an entertaining match.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbe62ee38102845998daf7c03baa1599acf20577\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbe62ee38102845998daf7c03baa1599acf20577/0_0_5482_3731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Djokovic celebrates winning\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Djokovic celebrates winning</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Gourley/BPI/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-21T14:08:47.290Z\">at 2.08pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c45cb80e4b0197a614f7413\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-21T13:41:14.685Z\">1.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Fourth set: Djokovic* 6-4, 6-7, 6-2, 5-3 Medvedev (*denotes server): </strong>Medvedev is starting to wallop the ball again and a huge forehand takes the game to deuce.

He\u2019s trying to show no weakness. You think back to the 2015 final, when he fooled Andy Murray into thinking he was struggling with an injury, and realise Medvedev needs to stay focused here. A double-fault for 15-30 is a bad sign. At 30-all Djokovic crashes a forehand pass beyond Medvedev for a break point. But when Djokovic nets a backhand slice, he\u2019s doubled over for a moment or two.

Is he hurt? He gets back to his feet, a little gingerly, but when he returns to his chair it\u2019s only to get a new racket. He looks seriously hacked off. Medvedev realises this is an opening, especially when Djokovic nets a backhand. Djokovic serves wide. Medvedev replies with a surprise squash shot and Djokovic nets forehand for 0-40. Three break points. Crucial moments. Djokovic saves the first two; it looked like Medvedev had him on the first, only to net a backhand. The third chance goes begging as well, though that\u2019s down to Djokovic\u2019s brilliance, a forehand down the line forcing deuce. Djokovic holds in the end.

Big game now for the young Russian. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6840d5cc6430ef727f4943a95857375b3263353b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6840d5cc6430ef727f4943a95857375b3263353b/0_0_2378_1585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Medvedev is broken\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medvedev is broken</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-21T11:08:46.875Z\">at 11.08am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c45a19ae4b0197a614f71e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-21T10:46:45.135Z\">10.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>First set: Medvedev 2-3 *Djokovic (*denotes server)</strong></p> <p>Bit of a mixed bag in that game, including back-to-back Djokovic unforced errors on his backhand, both tamely finding the net.

      "bodyText": "And here is Kevin Mitchell\u2019s report from Melbourne That\u2019s all from me today. We\u2019ll be back with more coverage tomorrow, with Rafael Nadal\u2019s quarter-final against Frances Tiafoe the main event. Thanks for reading. Bye. It will be interesting to see how Novak Djokovic is feeling after that heavy fall in the third set - but the good news for him is his quarter-final opponent is Kei Nishikori, who must be knackered after a controversial 6-7, 4-6, 7-6, 6-4, 7-6 win over Pablo Carreno Busta. \u201cHopefully we will both be fit for that one,\u201d Djokovic says. Novak Djokovic applauds Medvedev off and then heads for an on-court interview: \u201cSince my next opponent is watching I feel fantastic. I have never felt fresher in my life. Definitely it was a physical battle. Daniil has been playing some really good tennis. Big serve, a good backhand, he doesn\u2019t make many errors. It was difficult to go through him. I just had to find a different way. I was fortunate to save a couple of break points. I was 0-40, 1-2 in the third set, so that was a crucial hold.\u201d Still fuming, Medvedev is serving to stay in the match. He drops the first point, then lifts a forehand wide for 0-30. Djokovic doesn\u2019t need any encouragement - he earns three match points with a winning backhand return. He can\u2019t take the first, though, sending a backhand return long. Medvedev saves the second with a backhand into the open court. Not the third, though. An inside-out forehand from Djokovic is too good. It\u2019s all over. The pair meet at the net and have a good-natured chat about an entertaining match. Fourth set: Djokovic* 6-4, 6-7, 6-2, 5-3 Medvedev (*denotes server): Medvedev is starting to wallop the ball again and a huge forehand takes the game to deuce. But he flings his racket to the ground after losing the next point. The umpire\u2019s unimpressed. Medvedev nets on the next point and does it again, which is enough to earn him a code violation for unsportsmanlike conduct. Fourth set: Djokovic 6-4, 6-7, 6-2, 4-3 Medvedev* (*denotes server): Medvedev helps himself to an easy hold. He\u2019s not ready to fold yet. Fourth set: Djokovic* 6-4, 6-7, 6-2, 4-2 Medvedev (*denotes server): Just when it seems that nothing\u2019s happening, Medvedev clambers back from 40-15, volleying well to force deuce. The Russian perks up and earns a break point. Djokovic repels him with a crisp backhand. He holds, disappointing Medvedev again. Fourth set: Djokovic 6-4, 6-7, 6-2, 3-2 Medvedev* (*denotes server): Medvedev holds as Djokovic\u2019s concentration dips. Fourth set: Djokovic* 6-4, 6-7, 6-2, 3-1 Medvedev (*denotes server): Despite a couple of scratchy shots, Djokovic holds to 30, consolidating the break. Fourth set: Djokovic 6-4, 6-7, 6-2, 2-1 Medvedev* (*denotes server): Djokovic really wants to get this done as quickly as possible. He carves out a break point. Medvedev claims a Djokovic shot was long, but he doesn\u2019t look sure. In fact he\u2019s already walking back to his chair. Maybe he just wanted to sit down, because the ball caught the line. Djokovic breaks and Medvedev has called for the physio. Fourth set: Djokovic* 6-4, 6-7, 6-2, 1-1 Medvedev (*denotes server): Djokovic is irritable after making a couple of errors to gift Medvedev a 0-30 lead. He fights back to 30-all, but another error gives Medvedev a break point. Djokovic raises his intensity and overpowers Medvedev. He holds. Fourth set: Djokovic 6-4, 6-7, 6-2, 0-1 Medvedev* (*denotes server): Medvedev starts in the right manner here, holding to love. Can he regain some energy? Djokovic bangs down an ace to earn two set points. He takes the first with a polished forehand. It seems the potential wobble is well and truly over. Third set: Djokovic 6-4, 6-7, 5-2 Medvedev* (*denotes server): Djokovic, wearing his opponent down, makes it 0-15 when Medvedev nets a backhand. Then he makes it 0-30 with a vicious forehand. Maybe he should fall over more often. It seems to work for him. Medvedev is all over the place now, netting a backhand to make it 0-40. He saves the first two break points, but he\u2019s sore at the moment. Djokovic makes him run and extracts the error, a forehand going long, to break again. Third set: Djokovic* 6-4, 6-7, 4-2 Medvedev (*denotes server): Djokovic consolidates the break. Medvedev looks weary now. Third set: Djokovic 6-4, 6-7, 3-2 Medvedev* (*denotes server): Djokovic is grimacing a bit at the start of this game, but he hasn\u2019t asked for the trainer yet. He\u2019s trying to show no weakness. You think back to the 2015 final, when he fooled Andy Murray into thinking he was struggling with an injury, and realise Medvedev needs to stay focused here. A double-fault for 15-30 is a bad sign. At 30-all Djokovic crashes a forehand pass beyond Medvedev for a break point. But when Djokovic nets a backhand slice, he\u2019s doubled over for a moment or two. Medvedev bangs down an ace, but Djokovic pulls it back to deuce and earns another break point with some outrageous hitting. Djokovic enters wall mode - and Medvedev flings a forehand wide. If Djokovic is hurting he\u2019s hiding it well. Third set: Djokovic* 6-4, 6-7, 2-2 Medvedev (*denotes server): There\u2019s a worrying moment when Djokovic moves to the net and slips heavily after being wrongfooted by a Medvedev backhand pass. Is he hurt? He gets back to his feet, a little gingerly, but when he returns to his chair it\u2019s only to get a new racket. He looks seriously hacked off. Medvedev realises this is an opening, especially when Djokovic nets a backhand. Djokovic serves wide. Medvedev replies with a surprise squash shot and Djokovic nets forehand for 0-40. Three break points. Crucial moments. Djokovic saves the first two; it looked like Medvedev had him on the first, only to net a backhand. The third chance goes begging as well, though that\u2019s down to Djokovic\u2019s brilliance, a forehand down the line forcing deuce. Djokovic holds in the end. That could be a big game. Third set: Djokovic 6-4, 6-7, 1-2 Medvedev* (*denotes server): Djokovic doesn\u2019t look quite right at the moment. He\u2019s making a lot of silly errors. Medvedev looks to capitalise at 30-all, smacking a forehand to break the Serb\u2019s defences down. But the game goes to deuce. Another slugfest ensues, both men smashing the ball with venomous intent - but it\u2019s Djokovic who blinks first again. Medvedev holds from there. Third set: Djokovic* 6-4, 6-7, 1-1 Medvedev (*denotes server): Djokovic holds to 30. Third set: Djokovic 6-4, 6-7, 0-1 Medvedev* (*denotes server): Medvedev, remember, was 4-1 down in that second set and almost went 5-1 down. It was some turnaround. But he can\u2019t let his level dip against this guy. He has to keep pummelling those groundstrokes. He finds his serve here and holds to 15. Second set tie-break: Djokovic* 5-7 Medvedev (*denotes server): Medvedev gathers his thoughts as both players trade hard and flat groundstrokes from the baseline. The rally lasts for ever - until, that is, Djokovic nets a forehand! They\u2019re back on level terms! Second set tie-break: Djokovic 5-6 Medvedev* (*denotes server): Medvedev double-faults! Second set tie-break: Djokovic 4-6 Medvedev* (*denotes server): Djokovic saves the second with a superb backhand down the line. Second set tie-break: Djokovic* 3-6 Medvedev (*denotes server): Djokovic saves the first. Second set tie-break: Djokovic* 2-6 Medvedev (*denotes server): Djokovic dumps a rubbish drop shot into the net. Medvedev has four set points. Second set tie-break: Djokovic 2-5 Medvedev* (*denotes server): Medvedev overpowers Djokovic with a huge forehand. Second set tie-break: Djokovic 2-4 Medvedev* (*denotes server): Djokovic gets one mini-break back, picking Medvedev off at the net. Second set tie-break: Djokovic* 1-4 Medvedev (*denotes server): Djokovic double-faults! He challenges the second serve in vain - it was well long. Second set tie-break: Djokovic* 1-3 Medvedev (*denotes server): Medvedev batters a forehand wide. Second set tie-break: Djokovic 0-3 Medvedev* (*denotes server): Djokovic sends a backhand long on the run. Second set tie-break: Djokovic 0-2 Medvedev* (*denotes server): Djokovic pulls a wild forehand wide. Second set tie-break: Djokovic* 0-1 Medvedev (*denotes server): A long rally to start us off. It\u2019s pretty even - but Medvedev gets lucky when a Djokovic backhand clips the top of the net, giving him the chance to whip a forehand down the line. Second set: Djokovic 6-4, 6-6 Medvedev* (*denotes server): With Medvedev under pressure again, the game goes to 30-all. Medvedev finds a heavy serve for 40-30. Yet the game goes to deuce when Medvedev makes the strange decision to play a useless drop shot when he could have finished it off with a driven forehand. He makes up for it with an ace, one challenged incorrectly by Djokovic, who proceeds to send a forehand return wide. Tie-break. Intriguing. Second set: Djokovic* 6-4, 6-5 Medvedev (*denotes server): After the first two points are shared, an error from a flat Djokovic makes it 15-30. Then comes a draining rally, with Medvedev giving as good as he gets. He\u2019s the first to go big - but his forehand dips just wide. 30-all. Medvedev nets a couple of backhands and Djokovic holds. Second set: Djokovic 6-4, 5-5 Medvedev* (*denotes server): Serving to stay in the set, Medvedev runs to the net to reach a drop shot and scoop a forehand away for 40-15. He holds with a big serve. Second set: Djokovic* 6-4, 5-4 Medvedev (*denotes server): Looking distinctly unimpressed with this recent turn of events, Djokovic races into a 40-0 lead in brusque fashion. He holds to love. Medvedev faces another test of his nerve now. Second set: Djokovic 6-4, 4-4 Medvedev* (*denotes server): Djokovic is gripped by a mini slump at the moment, drilling a forehand wide to let Medvedev hold to love. We\u2019ve got a proper duel on our hands now. Three straight games for Medvedev. Second set: Djokovic* 6-4, 4-3 Medvedev (*denotes server): The game goes to 30-all, a couple of rare misses from Djokovic letting in Medvedev, who earns a break point when he comes out on top during the next rally. \u201cCome on Medvedev,\u201d shouts someone in the crowd - and the youngster duly obliges. A drop shot battle doesn\u2019t go Djokovic\u2019s way this time. Djokovic dabs a volley to the right, but Medvedev scampers back, sets himself and drives a backhand down the line to break! Djokovic is furious. Second set: Djokovic 6-4, 4-2 Medvedev* (*denotes server): At 30-15 Medvedev comes up with quite possible the worst drop shot of all time, a weird forehand slices that draws a wince from the crowd. The game goes to deuce. Djokovic, toying with his prey, earns a break point with a delicate drop shot. Medvedev finds his serve at a good time. He saves the break point and holds to keep his slim hopes alive. Second set: Djokovic* 6-4, 4-1 Medvedev (*denotes server): Medvedev looks like a man who\u2019s running out of ideas. Djokovic, meanwhile, is cruising, holding to 15 with an ace. Second set: Djokovic 6-4, 3-1 Medvedev* (*denotes server): Medvedev has a worried look on his face when Djokovic leads 30-40. Is this about to be another epic game? Nope. Djokovic pulls Medvedev into a grinding baseline rally. It always feels like a Medvedev error\u2019s on the way - sure enough, the Russian eventually loses patience with trying to break down the wall and nets a weary forehand. Second set: Djokovic* 6-4, 2-1 Medvedev (*denotes server): Is Djokovic going through a little dip? He double-faults to make it 15-30. But after all that drama, Djokovic isn\u2019t messing around. He wins the next three points to hold. Second set: Djokovic 6-4, 1-1 Medvedev* (*denotes server): Too many errors are creeping into Medvedev\u2019s game. He pretty much hands Djokovic a break point, though he saves it with a big serve. Djokovic shakes his head. He thinks he should have made the return. He earns another chance with a clever drop shot, but Medvedev saves again. Then the young Russian denies Djokovic with an ace. Djokovic doesn\u2019t slow down, though, earning a fourth chance with a searing forehand that clips the baseline. Medvedev stands firm with another fine serve. Djokovic gets break point number five; Medvedev somehow clings on with some outstanding defence, hanging in the rally before making Djokovic pay at the net. It\u2019s outstanding from both players, but how Medvedev needs to get out of this game safely. Eventually he does, capitalising on a couple of errors from Djokovic. Second set: Djokovic* 6-4, 1-0 Medvedev (*denotes server): This Djokovic gives you chances, as Medvedev noted before the match, but he also takes them. It will be tough for the young Russian to come back from this, though let\u2019s not forget that Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Roger Federer from a set down yesterday. There\u2019s hope yet for the young pretender. But not yet. Djokovic holds to love. And with that I shall hand you over to my colleague Jacob Steinberg to take you through to the close. Medvedev is standing so wide on his first serve and it initially paid dividends, the angle proving just too much for the Djokovic return. Some of the time, anyway, because the Serb isn\u2019t a six-time Aussie Open winner for nothing and he can adapt and think on the fly. That game management sends it to deuce and a double fault earned the world No1 set point. He sealed it, bursting to the net and picking his spot in the corner. An up-and-down game from both player\u2019s perspective but it\u2019s Djokovic who has first blood. First set: Medvedev 4-5 *Djokovic (*denotes server) Medvedev breaks! Well then. The 22-year-old came to the net on the first point with Djokovic\u2019s drop shot not precise enough and the Serb then sent a lob too long. The Russian again seized the initiative, moving forward to crunch a backhand winner at the T. All of a sudden it\u2019s 0-40 and while Djokovic saved the first, a monster rally, which saw the world No1 test his challenger with some really deep groundstrokes, ended with the Serb finding the net and Medvedev is very much back in the set, and the match itself, you would imagine. First set: Medvedev* 3-5 Djokovic (*denotes server) Not one, bit two Medvedev forehand winners! His serve looked solid again and Djokovic could only tee them up for the Russian to smash home a succession of points. Over to you, Novak. First set: Medvedev 2-5 *Djokovic (*denotes server) Medvedev initially looked unsettled and a little downcast after being broken but his backhand is so potent, and his own happy place he can always return to. It keeps him in the game and a slightly overhit Djokovic forehand after a long-ish rally sends it to deuce. That said, Djokovic foxed him with a deep slice that he could only send into the net and the slim chance he had of breaking disappeared with another slice from the Serb which he, again, can only find the net. Medvedev is playing uphill when he looked fully in control of the situation earlier on. That\u2019s what Djokovic can do to you. First set: Medvedev* 2-4 Djokovic (*denotes server) Djokovic breaks! The backhand has been the choice of weapon from both players but Djokovic\u2019s forehand is heating up. A delighted winner down the line levels the game at 15-15 and then he takes a 30-15 lead with more focus on the shot. The world No1 wins two breaks points and only needs one of them as Medvedev\u2019s feet a little slow to responding to a smart return. Big game now for the young Russian. First set: Medvedev 2-3 *Djokovic (*denotes server) Bit of a mixed bag in that game, including back-to-back Djokovic unforced errors on his backhand, both tamely finding the net. Maybe Medvedev had a point after all. That enabled the Russian to claim his first break of the match but after the Serb looked irate at some shouting in the crowd after a bungled first set he then held with some trademark defence and attack, getting Medvedev on the move and testing his shot-making. At deuce, more variation, with the Russian content to rally from deep and struggling slightly when asked to change pace and direction, and then an ace to finish things off. Signs, both of Medvedev\u2019s enduring threat and Djokovic\u2019s tactics in dampening that threat. First set: Medvedev* 2-2 Djokovic (*denotes server) Some fine returns from Djokovic in that game, although at 15-0 Medvedev was inches away from pulling off an outrageous backhand winner, low to his left. The world No1 had a glimmer of a break at 15-30 but an ace restored parity. A booming serve and backhand (becoming a feature) gave him daylight and then he levelled the set at 2-2 with another ace which zipped past the Serb. First set: Medvedev 1-2 *Djokovic (*denotes server) The game was briefly halted for the umpire to replace his microphone. The hilarity! Djokovic looked good, though, coming to the net, forcing Medvedev to mix up his shot selection and then striking some tidy winners. This is shaping up to be a very good match. First set: Medvedev* 1-1 Djokovic (*denotes server) The first rally of the match \u2013 and at 35 shots it\u2019ll take some beating \u2013 saw Djokovic test just how flat Medvedev can keep his backhand, the players barely moving from the centre of the baseline. Pretty flat, as it goes, flat enough to win that little skirmish. Thereafter the Russian ripped through the game, winning to love. His first serve accurate, solid and befitting of a man standing at 6ft 6in, not that you\u2019d necessarily know it in the way he plays. First set: Medvedev 0-1 *Djokovic (*denotes server) Djokovic breezed through the first two points but then sent a wide forehand, well, wide of Medvedev\u2019s backhand before a real kick of a second serve troubled the Russian and then set him nicely at 40-15. Fully in control, he sends the 22-year-old scampering round the court before Medvedev stretched to barely reach a forehand which was low and wide. This is what Medvedev said about Djokovic in the buildup to this match. What I can only say is that probably he is not playing as he was before. Before, when he was young, I was just watching on TV but it was just something insane when he was playing Andy (Murray) or somebody for five hours and you couldn\u2019t see one down (level), it was only up. It isn\u2019t the same now, you always have more chances to beat him and that\u2019s why he\u2019s lost three times to \u2018next-gen\u2019 players in the last year. I mean he has a *a point* but it\u2019s still some statement to make give his comparative light CV when it comes to Slams. Djokovic to serve first. Good morning/evening everyone, wherever you are. No Federer, no Zverev, no Cilic, no Anderson and, er, no Murray, only three remain of the men\u2019s top 10 seeds. And Novak Djokovic is one of them as he takes on young Russian Daniil Medvedev, part of a clutch of young Russians on the rise. Djokovic, unsurprisingly, is 2-0 up in their head-to-head having beaten Medvedev at Nottingham last year and in the Davis Cup, when the Russian claimed the first set before retiring hurt later in the match. The 22-year-old was mightily impressive in beating David Goffin in the last round in straights (and is yet to drop a set in the tournament) while some, including Medvedev (some call), have claimed their are sufficient chinks in Djokovic\u2019s armour to consider him beatable. This is already Medvedev\u2019s best performance in a grand slam as he takes on a 14-time major winner and a victory in Melbourne six times. The players are on court and warming up. Start is imminent.",

An international scandal erupted in 2013 when the mislabelled food was discovered by the Irish authorities in frozen burgers labelled \u201cpure beef\u201d. A wider investigation found horsemeat in ready-made meals on sale in several high-street supermarkets in Britain and in pre-prepared dishes across Europe, including those used by hospital caterers and in school lunches. About 4.5m dishes \u2013 including lasagne, moussaka, chilli con carne and beefburgers made with horsemeat passed off as beef \u2013 were believed to have been distributed around 13 countries. After an international investigation the source of the meat was traced back to French suppliers Spanghero and its production centre at Castelnaudary in the Aude. Spanghero had bought it from Romania via two companies based in the Netherlands and Cyprus. The prosecution alleges Spanghero knew it was buying frozen horsemeat and changed the customs code on the packaging. The French authorities claimed Spanghero had profited by more than \u20ac500,000 (\u00a3430,000) over six months by marketing the cheap horsemeat as much more expensive beef.

A young police officer, <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/FATAL-ENCOUNTER-Officer-Isaac-Espinoza-and-2716770.php\">Isaac Espinoza</a>, had been gunned down on the job, and the city\u2019s rank-and-file were out for blood.</p> \n<p>Harris had unseated the incumbent (albeit unpopular) district attorney in part by campaigning to not seek capital punishment. Three days before the funeral at St Mary\u2019s, Harris announced that she intended to keep her campaign promise, much to the fury of the police. But as she sat in the cathedral, the woman who would later become her colleague, Senator Dianne Feinstein, veered from the script and <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/Feinstein-s-surprise-call-for-death-penalty-puts-3313728.php\">called for the death penalty</a>, prompting thousands of officers to their feet.</p> \n<p>Harris remained sitting.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I\u2019ll hand that to her.

She stayed the course, as she always had in her meteoric rise in San Francisco and California politics. Her career has been dotted with moments like the one in St Mary\u2019s, but her track record shows that she has grand ambitions and a plan on how to achieve them, making both friends and enemies along the way.</p> \n<p>And now, as she eyes the highest office in the land, few doubt her ability to eventually get where she wants to go.</p> \n<p>\u201cNobody works harder than Kamala Harris,\u201d said Lateefah Simon, Harris\u2019s longtime friend. \u201cShe\u2019s a strategist.

Ahead of the primary, the San Francisco police department became embroiled in a scandal. A criminalist at the department admitted<strong> </strong>to regularly <a href=\"https://archives.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2010/12/14/a-timeline-of-problems-at-the-sfpd-dna-lab\">stealing cocaine</a> from evidence.

The race was so close that it was not until three weeks after the election and the provisional ballots were counted that the former Los Angeles county district attorney Steve Cooley conceded.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou got to remember, Kamala Harris is all politics all the time,\u201d Cooley said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question when it comes to being a politician, she is very committed and hardworking, whereas I was a career prosecutor. I never perceived myself as a politician.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nine years later, Cooley still expresses some bitterness over the loss, and Harris\u2019s criminal justice record, saying that he\u2019s heard from \u201cmany elected DAs\u201d around the state who believe she was \u201cthe worst attorney general ever\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/jan/17/2020-election-candidates-list-democrats-primaries-trump-bernie-sanders-joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-kamala-harris-beto-o-rourke-running\">Who will run in 2020?

But I still feel really positive about her.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a prime example of the insular and small-world nature of San Francisco politics, the San Francisco supervisor Aaron Peskin and Harris had not only attended Thousand Oaks elementary school together in Berkeley, but were in the same class from kindergarten through third grade. \u201cHer mother was Shyamala, from India, and my mother was Tsipora, from what was then Palestine, now Israel,\u201d Peskin said. \u201cIt\u2019s a total Bay Area story.\u201d</p> \n<p>When Peskin\u2019s father died in April, he was surprised to get a text message from Harris containing a snapshot of a class book they had put together as kids with the message: \u201cThinking of you.\u201d</p> \n<p>It\u2019s telling that even her former adversaries are reluctant to speak too badly of her, in part because many believe that like every other goal she\u2019s met in her life, she\u2019s destined for higher office, whether in this race or the next.</p> \n<p>But for more, there\u2019s an aspect of game recognizing game. No matter the criticism of Harris, no one can deny that she stayed the course, in a time when few have the necessary discipline, dedication or political knowhow to do so.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t come from a place of privilege or money,\u201d said Adachi, the public defender. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a Kennedy. She had to work hard to get to where she is. A lot of people say she coasted into the Senate position. No, it was because of the political capital she built from those other races. And since then, she has been able to take the political capital, and amplify it. And she\u2019ll do it for every office she\u2019ll run for.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Before Trump, before the Kavanaugh hearings, the book tour, the \u201cshe\u2019s running\u201d memes, the California senator Kamala Harris sat in St Mary\u2019s Cathedral in San Francisco amid a sea of blue-uniformed police officers. The year was 2004, just a few months into Harris\u2019s first term as San Francisco district attorney \u2013 her first elected position. A young police officer, Isaac Espinoza, had been gunned down on the job, and the city\u2019s rank-and-file were out for blood. Harris had unseated the incumbent (albeit unpopular) district attorney in part by campaigning to not seek capital punishment. Three days before the funeral at St Mary\u2019s, Harris announced that she intended to keep her campaign promise, much to the fury of the police. But as she sat in the cathedral, the woman who would later become her colleague, Senator Dianne Feinstein, veered from the script and called for the death penalty, prompting thousands of officers to their feet. Harris remained sitting. To this day, some city police officers will still clench their teeth when Harris\u2019s name comes up in conversation, recalling what they describe as a betrayal 15 years prior. But Harris took the political hit. She stayed the course, as she always had in her meteoric rise in San Francisco and California politics. Her career has been dotted with moments like the one in St Mary\u2019s, but her track record shows that she has grand ambitions and a plan on how to achieve them, making both friends and enemies along the way. And now, as she eyes the highest office in the land, few doubt her ability to eventually get where she wants to go. \u201cNobody works harder than Kamala Harris,\u201d said Lateefah Simon, Harris\u2019s longtime friend. \u201cShe\u2019s a strategist. She has a memory like nobody you\u2019ll ever meet. But more than that, I think she cares. She cares about what happens in the lives of the people in our community.\u201d San Francisco has long been considered a liberal bastion, but it\u2019s taken time for the city\u2019s power structure to reflect the diversity of the people. But until Harris was elected district attorney in 2003, only white men had held that office. Born in Oakland in 1964, at the height of the Bay Area\u2019s anti-war and civil rights activism, she was bussed to an elementary school in Berkeley as \u201cpart of a national experiment in desegregation\u201d, according to her political memoir, The Truths We Hold. Her parents \u2013 Shyamala Gopalan, an Indian immigrant, and Donald Harris, who was born in Jamaica \u2013 would often bring her to marches and protests at UC Berkeley. After her parents divorced, Harris and her younger sister, Maya, who would go on to become a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign, were primarily raised by their mother. Harris attended high school in Montreal, where her mother had a job teaching at McGill University, and went on to study at Howard University before returning to the Bay Area for law school at UC Hastings. There, she met Jeff Adachi. Later on, as the city\u2019s public defender, he would face off with Harris as her chief in-court adversary when she became the city\u2019s top prosecutor. But at UC Hastings, he was just a tutor. \u201cEven then, she was an extremely talented, charismatic person who had a very strong ambition. That was something that struck me right away,\u201d Adachi said. \u201cShe was always a people person, as she is now, but always very focused on whatever it was that she wanted.\u201d In her last summer in law school, she went on to intern at the Alameda county district attorney\u2019s office, where she spent a few years after she passed the bar. She later went on to the San Francisco district attorney\u2019s office as a line prosecutor, eventually taking over the office\u2019s career criminal unit. \u201cI remember asking her why she wanted to be a prosecutor,\u201d Adachi said, \u201cand she said, \u2018That\u2019s how I\u2019m going to change the world.\u2019\u201d In 1994, Harris met then state assembly speaker Willie Brown, a controversial figure in California politics. Back then, he was called the \u201cAyatollah of the Assembly\u201d. In San Francisco, a city defined by its great wealth and even greater economic disparities in part because of its rich history of political back-scratching, he\u2019d go on to be known by many names: \u201cDa Mayor\u201d (he was mayor of San Francisco from 1996 to 2004); the kingmaker; the puppetmaster. Anybody in Brown\u2019s orbit is considered part of the Willie Brown machine \u2013 which, depending on who you ask, is either merely an influential, moderate-leaning branch of the California Democratic party, a self-serving cartel with the lobbying and fundraising skills to make or break careers, or both. Brown\u2019s proteges soar high, but the whispers follow. This rang especially true for Harris, who dated Brown for about a year. He was 60 and she was 29. During this time, Brown appointed her to the state Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board and the California Medical Assistance Commission, both high-paying positions. Many politicians owe their success to Brown. He launched the careers of California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, the former California state senator Mark Leno, and the former San Francisco mayor Ed Lee, but when discussing Harris, the talk gets particularly nasty, in part because of their romantic history. Harris has spent much of the past 25 years distancing herself from Brown \u2013 she doesn\u2019t mention him once in her political memoir. But much like he did for Newsom and Leno, Brown opened doors. And when it came time for her to run for district attorney after a stint working in the city attorney\u2019s office, she won. \u201cIn those days, when you were supported by Willie Brown, it came with all the support and money of the San Francisco establishment,\u201d said Aaron Peskin, a current member of the San Francisco board of supervisors. In San Francisco, where only less than 7% of all registered voters are registered Republican, the political spectrum spans mostly between moderate and progressive Democrat. Peskin, a longtime progressive stalwart in city government with healthy skepticism of Willie Brown\u2019s influence, found himself aligned with Harris, despite their political differences. \u201cI was an early enthusiast for Kamala Harris for district attorney, even though I\u2019m a self-professed leftie and she came from the Willie Brown moderates,\u201d Peskin said. \u201cAll things being equal, I\u2019d rather have a district attorney that is independent of the mayor [Brown was still mayor at the time Harris was elected]. Mayors want to have influence over the legislative body, but how often do mayors call upon the district attorney?\u201d Harris ran for district attorney at a contentious time for the office. The incumbent, Terence Hallinan, a prominent progressive, had unsuccessfully tried to indict the entire command staff of the San Francisco police department. Hallinan was unpopular, but it was still shocking for a first-time candidate to beat not just a sitting official, but also a serial candidate for district attorney, Bill Fazio. \u201cShe had a lot of support,\u201d said Fazio, a former prosecutor and the third candidate in the race. \u201cShe was a new face, an attractive candidate, and I don\u2019t just mean in a physical sense. For San Francisco, she fit in well. She had connections through Willie Brown. She was introduced to a lot of moneyed people.\u201d Harris had campaigned on the promise to repair relations between her office and the embattled police department \u2013 and then, on her 100th day in office, there she was in St Mary\u2019s Cathedral, watching as thousands of cops cheered against her. Peskin had attended the funeral and remained seated as well, and remembered seeing her a few rows in front him, her face ashen. \u201cIt was so hard and painful,\u201d said Lateefah Simon, Harris\u2019s longtime friend. \u201cShe was new to the office and she had always been clear: she was anti-death penalty. But you know, I never saw Kamala bow her head down in any kind of shame. I think during this time, she began to deeply understand the power of her voice and how she could move through situations.\u201d A few months later, Harris called Simon up and asked her if she wanted to run her re-entry services. Simon told Harris it would be risky to hire her, \u201ca teen mom with no college degree\u201d. (Simon is selling herself short here \u2013 she is the youngest woman to receive the prestigious MacArthur Fellowship). But Harris refused to let Simon settle, and part of her employment agreement included the requirement to get her degree. \u201cShe made me show her my report cards!\u201d Simon laughed. \u201cListen, Kamala Harris is the toughest person that you\u2019ll ever work for,\u201d Simon said. \u201cShe is just a zealot about public service, and it\u2019s intense. But everybody who works for Kamala is forever transformed. I know it\u2019s not just me. There were many others.\u201d Harris regularly put in 12- to 14-hour days, talking to victims\u2019 families \u201cand promising them justice\u201d, Simon said. She held her employees to high standards, but herself to even higher ones. \u201cOne day, she had a really bad cold,\u201d Simon said. \u201cIt was like the flu. She had tissues, but she was still impeccably dressed, and she had a bowl of clementines on her impeccably organized desk. It was like 4.50pm. I said, \u2018Ms Harris\u2019 \u2013 because I always called her Ms Harris when I worked for her \u2013 \u2018it\u2019s almost quitting time, and you\u2019re sick.\u2019 She took a sip of water, looked at those bowls of clementines and then looked me dead in the eyes and said, \u2018I don\u2019t get sick.\u2019\u201d Harris has received criticism for her record as district attorney, for which she was re-elected in 2007. While Harris has been outspoken about her progressive values on police reform and criminal justice, her critics say her time as district attorney does not reflect that. \u201cIn many respects, she was a traditional prosecutor, concerned with conviction rates and victims\u2019 rights,\u201d Adachi said. \u201cThis was before the criminal justice reform movement and Black Lives Matter had really taken hold, and she pretty much ran the office as you would expect a prosecutor to run an office. But she was also open to programs that helped individuals turn their lives around.\u201d One of the biggest missteps of her tenure as district attorney arose as she was running for attorney general in 2010. Ahead of the primary, the San Francisco police department became embroiled in a scandal. A criminalist at the department admitted to regularly stealing cocaine from evidence. The woman also implicated other analysts in poor investigative work, resulting in the dismissal of hundreds of pending cases. A superior court judge pilloried Harris\u2019s office in a scathing ruling on the case and essentially accused her office of violating defendants\u2019 constitutional rights by not informing them of the issues, as prosecutors are obligated to. Entering the race with this scandal hanging overhead, the odds were against Harris. Yet she won. The race was so close that it was not until three weeks after the election and the provisional ballots were counted that the former Los Angeles county district attorney Steve Cooley conceded. \u201cYou got to remember, Kamala Harris is all politics all the time,\u201d Cooley said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question when it comes to being a politician, she is very committed and hardworking, whereas I was a career prosecutor. I never perceived myself as a politician.\u201d Nine years later, Cooley still expresses some bitterness over the loss, and Harris\u2019s criminal justice record, saying that he\u2019s heard from \u201cmany elected DAs\u201d around the state who believe she was \u201cthe worst attorney general ever\u201d. But underneath the bitterness is a grudging respect. \u201cShe looked at everything she did as DA from a political prism,\u201d he said. \u201cAttorney general is a pretty powerful position in California. I think when she was DA, she was already looking at it as the next step up the ladder. Watch her now. She\u2019s in the Senate and now apparently she\u2019s going for president.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll hand that to her. Her ambition is without equal.\u201d Ambitious women get a bad rep in this world, especially ambitious politicians who are women, and Harris and her supporters have heard it all. Calculating. Untrustworthy. Unlikable. \u201cThis is what happens when you have a dynamic and gifted woman of color who goes into her job and does her job,\u201d Simon said. Bill Fazio, the attorney who Harris defeated in her first race for district attorney, still balks when he hears people describe Harris as \u201cguarded\u201d or \u201ccold\u201d because he knows that she is anything but that. In March 2009, Fazio\u2019s wife died and out of the blue, he received a call from Harris. \u201cHer mom passed away about the same time, and she was very close to her mom.\u201d Fazio said. \u201cAll she wanted to do was to talk about our personal losses in a very personal way.\u201d He continued: \u201cPeople always call me up thinking I\u2019m going to trash her. But I still feel really positive about her.\u201d In a prime example of the insular and small-world nature of San Francisco politics, the San Francisco supervisor Aaron Peskin and Harris had not only attended Thousand Oaks elementary school together in Berkeley, but were in the same class from kindergarten through third grade. \u201cHer mother was Shyamala, from India, and my mother was Tsipora, from what was then Palestine, now Israel,\u201d Peskin said. \u201cIt\u2019s a total Bay Area story.\u201d When Peskin\u2019s father died in April, he was surprised to get a text message from Harris containing a snapshot of a class book they had put together as kids with the message: \u201cThinking of you.\u201d It\u2019s telling that even her former adversaries are reluctant to speak too badly of her, in part because many believe that like every other goal she\u2019s met in her life, she\u2019s destined for higher office, whether in this race or the next. But for more, there\u2019s an aspect of game recognizing game. No matter the criticism of Harris, no one can deny that she stayed the course, in a time when few have the necessary discipline, dedication or political knowhow to do so. \u201cShe didn\u2019t come from a place of privilege or money,\u201d said Adachi, the public defender. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a Kennedy. She had to work hard to get to where she is. A lot of people say she coasted into the Senate position. No, it was because of the political capital she built from those other races. And since then, she has been able to take the political capital, and amplify it. And she\u2019ll do it for every office she\u2019ll run for.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u2018You\u2019re looking at the American Idol of 1956. I\u2019ve been doing this for 60 years,\u201d says Judy Collins, now 79, sparkling from head to toe in pristine white with the ornate backdrop of the church\u2019s stained-glass windows glowing behind her.</p> <p>Accompanied by pianist Russell Walden, she tenderly strums an acoustic guitar to open with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/26/joni-mitchell-blue-hissing-summer-lawns-court-spark-hejira-dylan\">Joni Mitchell</a>\u2019s Chelsea Morning. There\u2019s a brief false start, called a \u201cJudy moment\u201d, but soon her voice is soaring through the room and not sounding anywhere close to its age. Performing the songs of others has been an indispensable part of Collins\u2019 career, and tonight is a celebration of her lifelong quest to share the music she loves. She soon glides into the Beatles\u2019 Norwegian Wood, with Walden\u2019s jumping piano lines and Collins\u2019 guitar strums dancing around one another, while her voice projects a potent range and embracing warmth.</p> <p>The evening unfolds in a series of stories and songs. Often Collins will be midway through an anecdote, usually centred on family, her life or somebody famous, and then she will break into song. Sometimes she sings just a snippet of a verse or chorus \u2013 from My Sweet Valentine to Rock Around the Clock \u2013 and at others she leaps straight into the next song. This intermingling of stories and songs, and songs within stories, and stories generating songs is a unique take on folk. It\u2019s presented with such seamless timing and delivery that it is never tired or predictable.</p> <p>Collins is frequently funny when regaling the audience. \u201cThe older I get, the cuter they are,\u201d she says of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/21/judy-collins-on-stephen-stills-i-said-its-such-a-beautiful-song-but-its-not-winning-me-back\">a previous tour with Stephen Stills</a> when there was a budget for a \u201ccute guitar-tech minion\u201d, then she pauses to tune her own. Of Bob Dylan during his Woody Guthrie-emulating period, she says: \u201cI thought he was pathetic. It was embarrassing\u201d. That attitude changed when she heard Dylan\u2019s records, an acknowledgment she follows by playing Masters of War and Mr Tambourine Man. The former creeps with intensity as the guitar strums and the piano becomes more charged, brewing up a quiet force, while during the latter she instigates a singalong, creating her own personal backing choir as the voices reverberate throughout the church.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/21/judy-collins-on-stephen-stills-i-said-its-such-a-beautiful-song-but-its-not-winning-me-back\">Judy Collins on Stephen Stills: \u2018I said, it's such a beautiful song, but it's not winning me back\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2017, Collins released the album A Love Letter to Stephen Sondheim and this evening she plays several of the composer\u2019s songs, such as the dreamy and lounge-esque No One Is Alone. There\u2019s a knock-out, spine-tingling performance of Leonard Cohen\u2019s Suzanne, which seems to linger in the air long after the words leave her mouth, while her take on Mitchell\u2019s Both Sides Now is as stirring and delicate as ever. </p> <p>Collins\u2019 voice very occasionally cracks or slips, but it is largely impeccable and what she can still do with it remains staggering. Her love for other people\u2019s songs is axiomatic \u2013 she treats them with such reverence and respect that you\u2019d think they were her own. While she slips in her own material occasionally, such as In the Twilight, her performance is largely a heady amalgamation of fandom and artistry; a vast voyage through the great American songbook, delivered by one of its most treasured voices.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://www.songkick.com/concerts/34477044-judy-collins-at-gala-theatre?utm_source=11593&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=widget&amp;utm_content=139749\">Gala theatre, Durham</a>, on 21 January. <a href=\"http://www.judycollins.com/concerts/\">Then touring</a>. </p>",

I\u2019ve been doing this for 60 years,\u201d says Judy Collins, now 79, sparkling from head to toe in pristine white with the ornate backdrop of the church\u2019s stained-glass windows glowing behind her. Accompanied by pianist Russell Walden, she tenderly strums an acoustic guitar to open with Joni Mitchell\u2019s Chelsea Morning. There\u2019s a brief false start, called a \u201cJudy moment\u201d, but soon her voice is soaring through the room and not sounding anywhere close to its age. Performing the songs of others has been an indispensable part of Collins\u2019 career, and tonight is a celebration of her lifelong quest to share the music she loves. She soon glides into the Beatles\u2019 Norwegian Wood, with Walden\u2019s jumping piano lines and Collins\u2019 guitar strums dancing around one another, while her voice projects a potent range and embracing warmth. The evening unfolds in a series of stories and songs. Often Collins will be midway through an anecdote, usually centred on family, her life or somebody famous, and then she will break into song. Sometimes she sings just a snippet of a verse or chorus \u2013 from My Sweet Valentine to Rock Around the Clock \u2013 and at others she leaps straight into the next song. This intermingling of stories and songs, and songs within stories, and stories generating songs is a unique take on folk. It\u2019s presented with such seamless timing and delivery that it is never tired or predictable. Collins is frequently funny when regaling the audience. \u201cThe older I get, the cuter they are,\u201d she says of a previous tour with Stephen Stills when there was a budget for a \u201ccute guitar-tech minion\u201d, then she pauses to tune her own. Of Bob Dylan during his Woody Guthrie-emulating period, she says: \u201cI thought he was pathetic. It was embarrassing\u201d. That attitude changed when she heard Dylan\u2019s records, an acknowledgment she follows by playing Masters of War and Mr Tambourine Man. The former creeps with intensity as the guitar strums and the piano becomes more charged, brewing up a quiet force, while during the latter she instigates a singalong, creating her own personal backing choir as the voices reverberate throughout the church. In 2017, Collins released the album A Love Letter to Stephen Sondheim and this evening she plays several of the composer\u2019s songs, such as the dreamy and lounge-esque No One Is Alone. There\u2019s a knock-out, spine-tingling performance of Leonard Cohen\u2019s Suzanne, which seems to linger in the air long after the words leave her mouth, while her take on Mitchell\u2019s Both Sides Now is as stirring and delicate as ever. Collins\u2019 voice very occasionally cracks or slips, but it is largely impeccable and what she can still do with it remains staggering. Her love for other people\u2019s songs is axiomatic \u2013 she treats them with such reverence and respect that you\u2019d think they were her own. While she slips in her own material occasionally, such as In the Twilight, her performance is largely a heady amalgamation of fandom and artistry; a vast voyage through the great American songbook, delivered by one of its most treasured voices. \u2022 At Gala theatre, Durham, on 21 January. Then touring.",

Amid already falling levels of growth in Europe, China and Japan, the IMF said an escalation of the trade war between Donald Trump and Beijing over the coming months and the UK tumbling out of the EU without a deal would force further downgrades in its forecasts for growth. The Washington-based organisation said global growth would weaken from 3.7% in 2018 to 3.5% this year, down 0.2 percentage points from its prediction last October. In a report published on the first day of the Davos leaders\u2019 summit in Switzerland, it blamed the developed world for much of the downgrade and Germany and Italy in particular. Unexpected developments had inflicted economic damage, it said, which in Germany followed the introduction of new fuel emission standards on cars, leading to a slump in production and purchases, and in Italy, where the economy ran out of steam in the wake of its battle with EU officials over the 2019 budget. Turkey, which is projected to suffer a deeper contraction in growth this year than anticipated, also lay behind the worsening picture. Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, said policymakers needed to make greater efforts to prepare for the slowdown, which could become more severe without greater cooperation. \u201cEven as the global economy moves forward, the risks that lie ahead are getting greater,\u201d she said. \u201cDoes that mean a global recession is around the corner?

The Law Commission, which reviews and recommends changes to legislation, is to consult on a range of proposals on the immigration rules, which set out the policy and practice of the home secretary in regulating the entry and stay of people in the UK. The proposals include an audit of overlapping rules and a limit to the number of times a year the rules are changed. The Home Office has sponsored the independent body to complete the project, which will not consider any issue of substantive immigration policy. The commission believes simpler rules would increase transparency for applicants and lead to quicker decision-making by Home Office caseworkers. Critics, including senior judges and lawyers, frequently criticise the labyrinthine rules for being repetitive, archaic and hard to navigate for people looking to move, work, study, visit or seek asylum in the UK. Since their introduction in 1973, the rules have grown from 40 pages to 1,100, and in the last 10 years have almost quadrupled in length. An exercise by the Guardian last year revealed Home Office officials had made more than 5,700 changes to the immigration rules since 2010. The law commissioner for public law, Nicholas Paines QC, said: \u201cAs the immigration rules have become longer, more detailed and more specific, they\u2019ve also become more complicated and harder to follow for applicants. \u201cThe Home Office has asked us to help put things right. Our proposals would introduce clearer language, and improve the presentation of the rules so they\u2019re easier to understand and follow. \u201cWe seek the public\u2019s views on how to make the immigration rules simpler and more accessible.\u201d The consultation, which starts on 21 January, will examine a range of potential improvements including the standardisation of wording to reduce the possibility of confusion. The commission has asked whether, except in urgent cases, changes to rules should be limited to two common commencement dates a year and whether headings, the inclusion of definitions and section numbering could be done with a uniform approach. The body will also investigate whether technology could improve an applicant\u2019s experience, such as through the online presentation of the rules including an initial route map, and interactive tools to guide them through the application process and alert them if the application is defective in any way.",

Clusters of red-brick tower blocks are a common feature of Egypt\u2019s urban sprawl, and house much of the country\u2019s population of nearly 100 million people.

Commonly known as \u201cashwiyyet\u201d, and including many unpainted buildings, these areas of informal housing, which contain 40% of Egypt\u2019s population, are often seen as places of social and sometimes political unrest. David Sims, an urban planning expert and the author of Understanding Cairo: The Logic of a City Out of Control, estimated at least 10m buildings across Egypt were in bare red brick. \u201cPainting all red-brick buildings will be a real national project,\u201d he said. This would include buildings in \u201crural areas where practically all are in red brick, and \u2026 over half [the red-brick buildings] in cities are informal,\u201d Sims added.

The sense of isolation is still palpable. There are few beaches, no resort hotels, and getting here requires a flight or 2\u00bd-hour ferry ride from Tenerife \u2013 but the few that make the effort are amply rewarded. It seemed like the perfect destination for an off-the-beaten-track hiking adventure with the kids.</p> <p>My seven-year-old daughter and I are joining friends on a guided three-day group trip, exploring the island on foot and by car from our base at <a href=\"http://hotel-balneario-pozo-de-la-salud.frontera.hotels-canary-islands.com\" title=\"\">Balneario Pozo de la Salud</a>, a small spa hotel on a bay on the west coast. We start our tour at the Faro de Punta Orchilla, a lighthouse on the south-western tip of the island and regarded as the prime meridian for early map makers, until Greenwich won out. The seven of us are the only ones here. In February, it\u2019s hot and eerily quiet. \u201cOut there,\u201d our guide, Paolo, says, gazing over the ocean, \u201cpeople once thought there was nothing but sea monsters.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c046645aa088b1f706da56dd50d38d5f2efbe544\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c046645aa088b1f706da56dd50d38d5f2efbe544/0_0_3618_2171/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Orchilla lighthouse on black volcanic  rock, ocean in background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zero in \u2026 the Orchilla lighthouse was once the prime meridian.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back in the car, we wind up along switchback roads. At over 100 metres, \u201cheroic vineyards\u201d, so-called for the strength and agility needed to harvest the grapes, cling to the mountainside. Small villages are strung with colourful bunting \u2013 it is carnival season, and soon each village will be holding a celebration.</p> <p>We arrive at El Sabinar \u2013 a wild juniper forest shaped by centuries of fierce north-easterly winds. Bent double or twisting horizontally along the ground, these trees have been sculpted into extraordinary shapes. \u201cThe wind is an artist,\u201d Paolo smiles. \u201cIt shapes our land, the nature around us, and defines the way we live.\u201d</p> <p>El Hierro is an elemental place. Stark and rugged, its dark cliffs soar some 1,000 metres from the sea. Although it enjoys a sub-tropical climate, there can be a 10-degree difference in temperature from sea level to mountaintops. The terrain and ecosystems transform suddenly, too. One minute we\u2019re exploring dense, mossy woods and the next we are scrambling up scree slopes to a crater\u2019s edge; meadows give way to pine forests ravaged by fire but still thriving; lava fields ripple out from plantations of banana, avocado and pineapple. With such rich diversity, it\u2019s little wonder Unesco designated the island a biosphere reserve and geopark in 2015.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fff27fe86a7b221ae0dffae58a3c7b090ebd8d84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fff27fe86a7b221ae0dffae58a3c7b090ebd8d84/0_194_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kari\u2019s daughter and friends examine one of El Sabinar\u2019s twisted trees.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Twisted sister \u2026 Kari\u2019s daughter and friends examine one of El Sabinar\u2019s trees.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kari Herbert</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We stop for a swim at the village of La Restinga, which made headlines in 2011 when a submarine volcano erupted just 2km offshore. Magma bubbles were seen from the water\u2019s edge and all 600 villagers were evacuated. Despite this, the protected waters here are called Mar de las Calmas \u2013 Sea of Calm \u2013 and are one of the best diving spots in the world, with spectacular sub-acquatic flora and fauna. But even in high season Restinga is quiet. We see just three divers and a row of elderly gentlemen sipping wine.</p> <p>El Hierro\u2019s story is one of resilience. At the chapel of Our Lady of the Kings, we hear tales of miracles worked by the island\u2019s patron saint \u2013 mainly bringing rain. Nearby, we explore caves once inhabited by Bimbaches, the first inhabitants of the island, which are still used by modern-day shepherds. We pause to feed bananas to tiny lizards before heading to the Lagartario eco-museum to meet El Hierro\u2019s famous giant lizards, thought to be extinct until they were rediscovered in 1974.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4011f246315414d497bd5726d4293888e159dee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4011f246315414d497bd5726d4293888e159dee/0_26_509_305/500.jpg\" alt=\"Chapel, Our Lady of the Kings (Santuario de Nuestra Senora de Los Reyes), El Hierro, Canary Islands.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Our Lady of the Kings (Santuario de Nuestra Senora de Los Reyes).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Lukasseck/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Our hotel was built for those coming to take the healing waters of a spring discovered in the 18th century, and its clifftop location is hard to beat: the soundtrack is of Atlantic breakers crashing below. After days out exploring, we dine here on tasty, simple fare such as grilled fish with the Canaries\u2019 trademark <em>papas arrugadas</em>, small salt-crusted potatoes with green and red <em>mojo</em> dipping sauces. A standout dessert is El Hierro smoked cheese baked in palm syrup.</p> <p>With Paolo\u2019s encouragement, the kids (aged between seven and 10) walk for around four miles each day without complaint, dreaming up stories about lava giants or chasing pixies in the cloud forest. They search for King Neptune in sea stacks and <em>duendes </em>\u2013 mischievous spirits \u2013 in a rock face, and play where witches once danced by moonlight.

      "bodyText": "Clouds of volcanic dust envelop the car as we judder down the track through the Malpa\u00eds \u2013 the badlands. Contorted lava fields and cinder cones surround us in a fierce display. This was once believed to be the end of the Earth. Before Columbus voyaged to America, El Hierro \u2013 the smallest and least-visited of the Canary Islands \u2013 was the westernmost edge of the known world. It lies 190 miles off the coast of north Africa, with nothing but ocean to the west until Florida, some 3,000 miles away. The sense of isolation is still palpable. There are few beaches, no resort hotels, and getting here requires a flight or 2\u00bd-hour ferry ride from Tenerife \u2013 but the few that make the effort are amply rewarded. It seemed like the perfect destination for an off-the-beaten-track hiking adventure with the kids. My seven-year-old daughter and I are joining friends on a guided three-day group trip, exploring the island on foot and by car from our base at Balneario Pozo de la Salud, a small spa hotel on a bay on the west coast. We start our tour at the Faro de Punta Orchilla, a lighthouse on the south-western tip of the island and regarded as the prime meridian for early map makers, until Greenwich won out. The seven of us are the only ones here. In February, it\u2019s hot and eerily quiet. \u201cOut there,\u201d our guide, Paolo, says, gazing over the ocean, \u201cpeople once thought there was nothing but sea monsters.\u201d Back in the car, we wind up along switchback roads. At over 100 metres, \u201cheroic vineyards\u201d, so-called for the strength and agility needed to harvest the grapes, cling to the mountainside. Small villages are strung with colourful bunting \u2013 it is carnival season, and soon each village will be holding a celebration. We arrive at El Sabinar \u2013 a wild juniper forest shaped by centuries of fierce north-easterly winds. Bent double or twisting horizontally along the ground, these trees have been sculpted into extraordinary shapes. \u201cThe wind is an artist,\u201d Paolo smiles. \u201cIt shapes our land, the nature around us, and defines the way we live.\u201d El Hierro is an elemental place. Stark and rugged, its dark cliffs soar some 1,000 metres from the sea. Although it enjoys a sub-tropical climate, there can be a 10-degree difference in temperature from sea level to mountaintops. The terrain and ecosystems transform suddenly, too. One minute we\u2019re exploring dense, mossy woods and the next we are scrambling up scree slopes to a crater\u2019s edge; meadows give way to pine forests ravaged by fire but still thriving; lava fields ripple out from plantations of banana, avocado and pineapple. With such rich diversity, it\u2019s little wonder Unesco designated the island a biosphere reserve and geopark in 2015. We stop for a swim at the village of La Restinga, which made headlines in 2011 when a submarine volcano erupted just 2km offshore. Magma bubbles were seen from the water\u2019s edge and all 600 villagers were evacuated. Despite this, the protected waters here are called Mar de las Calmas \u2013 Sea of Calm \u2013 and are one of the best diving spots in the world, with spectacular sub-acquatic flora and fauna. But even in high season Restinga is quiet. We see just three divers and a row of elderly gentlemen sipping wine. El Hierro\u2019s story is one of resilience. At the chapel of Our Lady of the Kings, we hear tales of miracles worked by the island\u2019s patron saint \u2013 mainly bringing rain. Nearby, we explore caves once inhabited by Bimbaches, the first inhabitants of the island, which are still used by modern-day shepherds. We pause to feed bananas to tiny lizards before heading to the Lagartario eco-museum to meet El Hierro\u2019s famous giant lizards, thought to be extinct until they were rediscovered in 1974. Our hotel was built for those coming to take the healing waters of a spring discovered in the 18th century, and its clifftop location is hard to beat: the soundtrack is of Atlantic breakers crashing below. After days out exploring, we dine here on tasty, simple fare such as grilled fish with the Canaries\u2019 trademark papas arrugadas, small salt-crusted potatoes with green and red mojo dipping sauces. A standout dessert is El Hierro smoked cheese baked in palm syrup. With Paolo\u2019s encouragement, the kids (aged between seven and 10) walk for around four miles each day without complaint, dreaming up stories about lava giants or chasing pixies in the cloud forest. They search for King Neptune in sea stacks and duendes \u2013 mischievous spirits \u2013 in a rock face, and play where witches once danced by moonlight. The story says that the witches hoped to discover in their trances what had happened to their menfolk who had sailed to Venezuela and Cuba in search of an easier life. Today, life at the end of the world is not so hard. The island has no crime and the pace is slow. The people are hospitable and proud of their connection to nature. On our way back to the port we pass the towering wind turbines of the island\u2019s revolutionary new energy and desalination plant. Wind and sea are shaping the island\u2019s future too: El Hierro is set to become one of the world\u2019s first sustainable islands \u2013 wind and sun already supply 60% of the island\u2019s energy. In a couple of years it hopes to be fully energy self-sufficient. It is an extraordinary development, given that just 50 years ago few homes here had electricity at all. \u201cWe never complain about the wind,\u201d Paolo says. \u201cIt gives us life.\u201d The vast propellers turn slowly, catching the quickening trade winds, the ones Columbus tackled as he sailed into the unknown. Had he picked up supplies at El Hierro instead of neighbouring La Gomera, perhaps the course of history would have been different. I now know from experience that leaving this magical place is very, very hard. \u2022 The trip was provided by Much Better Adventures, whose new three-day guided tour of El Hierro is available from January to April and costs \u00a3478pp, including accommodation, meals and local transport.

      "bodyText": "Western culture and society pose more health risks to migrants and refugees than they do to host nations, according to a World Health Organization study. The first report on refugee and migrant health in the west by WHO Europe suggests new arrivals are at risk of falling ill while in transit to another country, but face further dangers when they arrive in a host nation because of unhealthy living conditions, poor diet and the obesity epidemic. The report on the health of refugees and migrants in the WHO European region says they do not transmit diseases or place a disproportionate burden on healthcare systems, and calls on countries to make decisions about providing services to migrants based on facts, rather than politics or prejudice. Dr Santino Severoni, the coordinator of public health and migration for WHO Europe, said: \u201cThis report is a wonderful opportunity to diffuse false myths, misperceptions and negative narrative. \u201cHealth is very politicised and used as a tool of fear, but this report has very solid facts and data that is coming from our member states.\u201d According to the report, international migrants make up 10% (90.7 million) of the population in the WHO European region. Just over 7% are refugees. \u201cIn some European countries, citizens estimate that there are three or four times more migrants than there really are,\u201d it said. Evidence collected by the WHO suggests migrants and refugees are less likely to be affected by non-contagious diseases such as cancer, stroke or heart disease, but their risk of developing such illnesses increases when they move to more developed countries, particularly as they are often living in poor conditions. While refugees and migrants are more vulnerable to infectious diseases when in transit from their home countries, the proportion with tuberculosis or HIV varies widely. WHO Europe said: \u201cDespite the widespread assumption to the contrary, there is only a very low risk of refugees and migrants transmitting communicable diseases to their host population.\u201d The report implicitly criticises the UK and other nations that charge some migrants and refugees for healthcare by suggesting the best way to protect the health of those in host nations and new arrivals is to provide universal, free healthcare. In December, representatives of more than 70,000 doctors urged ministers to suspend regulations that force hospitals to charge overseas visitors upfront for NHS care, voicing concern about pregnant women being denied care and children missing out on treatment for serious illnesses. Rules brought in in 2015 and 2017 under the \u201chostile environment\u201d immigration policy specify when overseas visitors should be charged for receiving NHS care. Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, the WHO regional director for Europe, said: \u201cAs migrants and refugees become more vulnerable than the host population to the risk of developing both noncommunicable and communicable diseases, it is necessary that they receive timely access to quality health services. \u201cThis is the best way to save lives and cut treatment costs, as well as protect the health of the resident citizens.\u201d The report also found: Refugees and migrants are at lower risk of all forms of cancer, but are more likely to be diagnosed at an advanced stage. Depression and anxiety are more common among refugees and migrants than host populations. Unaccompanied minors are vulnerable to sexual exploitation and experience higher rates of depression and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Male migrants experience significantly more work-related injuries than non-migrant workers. The report\u2019s authors called on European nations to provide good-quality, affordable healthcare to all migrants and refugees regardless of their legal status, and make health systems culturally and linguistically accessible. Severoni said: \u201cCountries tend to use costs as a justification of limiting or delaying healthcare access to newcomers or providing emergency access only. But this is not cost effective, early identification costs less than delaying until absolutely necessary hospital treatment.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It was a victory that was \u201csomewhat flattering,\u201d as Kicker put it, and even Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019s coach Dieter Hecking admitted his side were \u201ca bit lucky\u201d. Yet all it ultimately meant was that Peter Bosz returned to coaching in the Bundesliga as he had left it just over 13 months ago \u2013 with defeat, as he took the reins at Bayer Leverkusen.</p> \n<p>It was rarely dull when the Dutchman was in charge at Borussia Dortmund, a short spell so out of kilter with current events that it\u2019s almost as surreal as the extended period in which the leaders were glued to the foot of the table during J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s final campaign at the helm. If the evidence of his reintroduction to German football on Saturday afternoon is anything to go by, it is unlikely to be so this time either.</p> \n<p>Whether it will work out for Leverkusen is more open to debate, with plenty of promise displayed against Gladbach but no points to show for it in the final analysis. \u201cWe can say again that we played great, kept our opponents in check and deserved a goal,\u201d a frustrated Lars Bender told Sky. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jan/21/serie-a-returns-with-a-reminder-that-it-can-be-beautiful-too\">Serie A returns with a reminder that it can be beautiful too | Paolo Bandini</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That the visitors were more ruthless and composed was not a surprise, with Alessane Pl\u00e9a scoring a well-crafted winner which takes the Frenchman to double figures for Gladbach at a faster rate than the legendary Jupp Heynckes managed back in the 1960s. They were excellent before the winter break and stay just three points behind Bayern Munich.</p> \n<p>Yet they were never comfortable here. For Matthias Ginter, making his comeback after suffering a fractured jaw and eye socket in a sickening clash of heads with Hannover\u2019s Noah Sarenren Bazee in November, it was hardly a gentle way of easing oneself back into the swing of things. It was all hands to the pump for Gladbach for long spells, having just 36% possession and facing 22 efforts at goal from Leverkusen.</p> \n<p>So even if the result irked, there was a feeling of optimism in the BayArena corridors at full time. \u201cYou can see we\u2019ve learned a lot over the past two weeks,\u201d said Kai Havertz. \u201cWe did a lot of things better today than we did in the <em>Hinrunde</em>.\u201d The 19-year-old also praised Bosz for being \u201cgreat at dealing with young players\u201d which, as he pointed out, \u201cis especially important in Leverkusen\u201d. Getting a talent of Havertz\u2019s stature onside is a great start to Bosz\u2019s stewardship.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb31f7d5d30600a75f664fb5b1c12a8ea88e338a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb31f7d5d30600a75f664fb5b1c12a8ea88e338a/0_0_3500_2530/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bayer Leverkusen coach Peter Bosz.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"723\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bayer Leverkusen coach Peter Bosz.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wolfgang Rattay/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Havertz, Julian Brandt and Leon Bailey, whose focus has drifted in recent months, were all included in a new, ultra-attacking line-up. After the plod of the closing months of Heiko Herrlich\u2019s tenure, it feels like a relief. \u201cThe result is disappointing of course, but the way we played wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m convinced that we\u2019ll have a lot of fun in the second half of the season,\u201d said long-serving sporting director, Rudi V\u00f6ller.</p> \n<p>Therein, perhaps, lies at least some of the difference between the context of Bosz\u2019s difficulties at Dortmund and what he is adapting to with <em>Die Werkself</em>. In summer 2017 Bosz arrived at a club lacking direction upstairs, that accordingly didn\u2019t really know what they wanted. He was the second choice for the role; eventual incumbent Lucien Favre, pretty much Bosz\u2019s polar opposite, was the first. He inherited a team bruised from internal strife under Thomas Tuchel, still processing the aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/apr/11/borussia-dortmund-explosion-team-bus\">the bus attack</a> \u2013 and an uneven squad fettered by big expectations. At Leverkusen, nobody\u2019s expecting to chase the summit and the aim of making Europe \u2013 as Bosz pointed out post-match \u2013 is very doable with 16 matches to go and only a four-point gap. \u201cI think we\u2019re on a good path,\u201d he said. With the new man\u2019s ideas already crystal clear to his players, the route is in no doubt. Seatbelts will be required.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 With it now seeming unlikely that Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s Lucas Hern\u00e1ndez will arrive in this window, the Callum Hudson-Odoi transfer having hit an impasse of sorts and Benjamin Pavard only arriving from Stuttgart in the summer, it appears Bayern Munich may largely have to get on with what they have. Good for them, then, that they got the <em>R\u00fcckrunde</em> under way in ominous fashion on Friday, winning 3-1 at Hoffenheim with no need for some of the squad\u2019s elder elements. Leon Goretzka led the way with a brace and Bayern looked the part as they temporarily closed the gap at the top to three points behind Borussia Dortmund, and Kovac made it clear he is relishing the chance to put pressure on the leaders. \u201cNow they have to react,\u201d he said after the game.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f66495e91bb61d605f857584a39f267269b12fb3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f66495e91bb61d605f857584a39f267269b12fb3/0_0_3500_2239/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bayern celebrate in front of their fans after the match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"640\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bayern celebrate in front of their fans after the match.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ralph Orlowski/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 Dortmund did just that, becoming the first team to win at Leipzig this season in Saturday\u2019s late game, by a single goal via Axel Witsel\u2019s thunderous finish from a Rapha\u00ebl Guerreiro corner. This was exactly the sort of gritty win that potential champions need to get \u2013 and achieved without Marco Reus, the captain nursing a minor knock and not even named as a substitute. Reus continued to lead from the front, though, taking a seat on the touchline and encouraging his teammates in the dressing room, and it was that kind of all-hands-on-deck effort. Julian Weigl shone as a makeshift centre-back, and Roman B\u00fcrki made some important saves. Little wonder Favre told Sky he was \u201cextremely satisfied\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1086922654689517568\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What a strike!

It all fell into place \u2013 just \u2013 with Daniel Caligiuri firing a stylish late winner having earlier opened the scoring from the penalty spot. F\u00e4hrmann faced a bevy of lurking photographers as he took his seat on the bench, though Tedesco insisted his dropping for Alexander N\u00fcbel wasn\u2019t a \u201cfinal decision\u201d. He was just \u201cgetting a break\u201d, according to sporting director Christian Heidel.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s \u201c<em>B\u00fcffelherde</em>\u201d of S\u00e9bastien Haller, Ante Rebic and Luka Jovic were quickly rampaging again, getting a goal each to take them to a win over Freiburg and close the gap on the top four to a point. They now have 29 goals and 17 assists between them, with Jovic\u2019s strike taking him top of the Bundesliga scoring charts.</p> \n<p>\u2022 There\u2019s little change at the bottom, with 17th and 18th-placed Hannover and N\u00fcrnberg beaten at home by Werder Bremen and Hertha, respectively. The former\u2019s defeat would have been a humiliation without a standout display from goalkeeper Michael Esser. Stuttgart have been imaginative in this transfer window but defensive disarray in a 3-2 home reverse to Mainz \u2013 which kept them in the play-off spot \u2013 suggested teenage centre-back Ozan Kabak, signed from Galatasaray last week, might be expected to chip in sooner rather than later.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom

      "bodyText": "It was a victory that was \u201csomewhat flattering,\u201d as Kicker put it, and even Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019s coach Dieter Hecking admitted his side were \u201ca bit lucky\u201d. Yet all it ultimately meant was that Peter Bosz returned to coaching in the Bundesliga as he had left it just over 13 months ago \u2013 with defeat, as he took the reins at Bayer Leverkusen. It was rarely dull when the Dutchman was in charge at Borussia Dortmund, a short spell so out of kilter with current events that it\u2019s almost as surreal as the extended period in which the leaders were glued to the foot of the table during J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s final campaign at the helm. If the evidence of his reintroduction to German football on Saturday afternoon is anything to go by, it is unlikely to be so this time either. Whether it will work out for Leverkusen is more open to debate, with plenty of promise displayed against Gladbach but no points to show for it in the final analysis. \u201cWe can say again that we played great, kept our opponents in check and deserved a goal,\u201d a frustrated Lars Bender told Sky. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing.\u201d That the visitors were more ruthless and composed was not a surprise, with Alessane Pl\u00e9a scoring a well-crafted winner which takes the Frenchman to double figures for Gladbach at a faster rate than the legendary Jupp Heynckes managed back in the 1960s. They were excellent before the winter break and stay just three points behind Bayern Munich. Yet they were never comfortable here. For Matthias Ginter, making his comeback after suffering a fractured jaw and eye socket in a sickening clash of heads with Hannover\u2019s Noah Sarenren Bazee in November, it was hardly a gentle way of easing oneself back into the swing of things. It was all hands to the pump for Gladbach for long spells, having just 36% possession and facing 22 efforts at goal from Leverkusen. So even if the result irked, there was a feeling of optimism in the BayArena corridors at full time. \u201cYou can see we\u2019ve learned a lot over the past two weeks,\u201d said Kai Havertz. \u201cWe did a lot of things better today than we did in the Hinrunde.\u201d The 19-year-old also praised Bosz for being \u201cgreat at dealing with young players\u201d which, as he pointed out, \u201cis especially important in Leverkusen\u201d. Getting a talent of Havertz\u2019s stature onside is a great start to Bosz\u2019s stewardship. Havertz, Julian Brandt and Leon Bailey, whose focus has drifted in recent months, were all included in a new, ultra-attacking line-up. After the plod of the closing months of Heiko Herrlich\u2019s tenure, it feels like a relief. \u201cThe result is disappointing of course, but the way we played wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m convinced that we\u2019ll have a lot of fun in the second half of the season,\u201d said long-serving sporting director, Rudi V\u00f6ller. Therein, perhaps, lies at least some of the difference between the context of Bosz\u2019s difficulties at Dortmund and what he is adapting to with Die Werkself. In summer 2017 Bosz arrived at a club lacking direction upstairs, that accordingly didn\u2019t really know what they wanted. He was the second choice for the role; eventual incumbent Lucien Favre, pretty much Bosz\u2019s polar opposite, was the first. He inherited a team bruised from internal strife under Thomas Tuchel, still processing the aftermath of the bus attack \u2013 and an uneven squad fettered by big expectations. At Leverkusen, nobody\u2019s expecting to chase the summit and the aim of making Europe \u2013 as Bosz pointed out post-match \u2013 is very doable with 16 matches to go and only a four-point gap. \u201cI think we\u2019re on a good path,\u201d he said. With the new man\u2019s ideas already crystal clear to his players, the route is in no doubt. Seatbelts will be required. Talking points \u2022 With it now seeming unlikely that Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s Lucas Hern\u00e1ndez will arrive in this window, the Callum Hudson-Odoi transfer having hit an impasse of sorts and Benjamin Pavard only arriving from Stuttgart in the summer, it appears Bayern Munich may largely have to get on with what they have. Good for them, then, that they got the R\u00fcckrunde under way in ominous fashion on Friday, winning 3-1 at Hoffenheim with no need for some of the squad\u2019s elder elements. Leon Goretzka led the way with a brace and Bayern looked the part as they temporarily closed the gap at the top to three points behind Borussia Dortmund, and Kovac made it clear he is relishing the chance to put pressure on the leaders. \u201cNow they have to react,\u201d he said after the game. \u2022 Dortmund did just that, becoming the first team to win at Leipzig this season in Saturday\u2019s late game, by a single goal via Axel Witsel\u2019s thunderous finish from a Rapha\u00ebl Guerreiro corner. This was exactly the sort of gritty win that potential champions need to get \u2013 and achieved without Marco Reus, the captain nursing a minor knock and not even named as a substitute. Reus continued to lead from the front, though, taking a seat on the touchline and encouraging his teammates in the dressing room, and it was that kind of all-hands-on-deck effort. Julian Weigl shone as a makeshift centre-back, and Roman B\u00fcrki made some important saves. Little wonder Favre told Sky he was \u201cextremely satisfied\u201d. \u2022 The last game of the weekend already felt like a big one for Schalke, with Domenico Tedesco\u2019s team facing in-form Wolfsburg on the back of a very disappointing Hinrunde \u2013 and having moved on accordingly since, with iconic veteran centre-back Naldo joining Monaco and goalkeeper/captain Ralf F\u00e4hrmann left out. It all fell into place \u2013 just \u2013 with Daniel Caligiuri firing a stylish late winner having earlier opened the scoring from the penalty spot. F\u00e4hrmann faced a bevy of lurking photographers as he took his seat on the bench, though Tedesco insisted his dropping for Alexander N\u00fcbel wasn\u2019t a \u201cfinal decision\u201d. He was just \u201cgetting a break\u201d, according to sporting director Christian Heidel. \u2022 Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s \u201cB\u00fcffelherde\u201d of S\u00e9bastien Haller, Ante Rebic and Luka Jovic were quickly rampaging again, getting a goal each to take them to a win over Freiburg and close the gap on the top four to a point. They now have 29 goals and 17 assists between them, with Jovic\u2019s strike taking him top of the Bundesliga scoring charts. \u2022 There\u2019s little change at the bottom, with 17th and 18th-placed Hannover and N\u00fcrnberg beaten at home by Werder Bremen and Hertha, respectively. The former\u2019s defeat would have been a humiliation without a standout display from goalkeeper Michael Esser. Stuttgart have been imaginative in this transfer window but defensive disarray in a 3-2 home reverse to Mainz \u2013 which kept them in the play-off spot \u2013 suggested teenage centre-back Ozan Kabak, signed from Galatasaray last week, might be expected to chip in sooner rather than later.",

Some observers speculate that Trump is continuing the shutdown at the urging of a handful of White House insiders and Fox News pundits, as David Smith reports from Washington. Democratic 2020 hopefuls head south to mark MLK Day Senators Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker are both holding events in South Carolina on Monday to mark Martin Luther King day and, most likely, to make their pitch to black voters before they compete in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. South Carolina is the first southern state to hold its primary and a key contest on the path to a party nomination. Black Americans make up about 60% of Democratic voters in the Palmetto state, a group that Sanders signally failed to woo in 2016. Prosecutor or defender? The California senator Kamala Harris is expected to announce her presidential run on Monday. Will progressive voters tolerate her criminal justice record? Past positions. Kirsten Gillibrand and Tulsi Gabbard, who have already declared their candidacies, are both facing tricky questions about their past positions, reports Martin Pengelly. Patriots face Rams in Super Bowl after brilliant Brady display The New England Patriots have won their place in a third straight Super Bowl after defeating the favoured Kansas City Chiefs 37-31 in a dramatic AFC championship game on Sunday night. It was the veteran quarterback Tom Brady who once more guided the Patriots to victory in overtime, and who will now lead the team out in Atlanta for their ninth Super Bowl under his and coach Bill Belichick\u2019s command. There they will face the LA Rams, who overcame the Saints 26-23 in the NFC championship game. GOAT showboats. Brady was already the greatest quarterback of all time, writes Oliver Connolly. Now he\u2019s just rubbing it in. Stargazers brave cold to see \u2018super blood wolf moon\u2019 Thousands of night-sky enthusiasts across the northern hemisphere braved sub-zero temperatures on Sunday to see a rare astrological phenomenon: the \u201csuper blood wolf moon\u201d. \u201cSuper\u201d because the moon is closer than usual to the Earth and thus appears larger. \u201cBlood\u201d due to a total eclipse of the moon by the Earth\u2019s shadow, which lent the lunar surface a coppery red hue. And \u201cWolf\u201d because it occurred in January, when hungry wolves traditionally howled outside villages, according to the Farmer\u2019s Almanac. In pictures. The entire eclipse was visible from Britain, North and South America, and western and northern Europe. The next blood moon will not be for another two years. Crib sheet Israel\u2019s military has launched a strike against Iranian Quds targets inside Syria and, in an unusual statement, warned Syrian forces not to retaliate by attacking Israeli targets. Nick Sandmann, the Kentucky teenager filmed wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and apparently confronting a Native American activist, has said the widely shared footage gave the false impression that he and his classmates instigated the confrontation. After years of rapid expansion, the Chinese economy grew at a sluggish 6.6% in 2018, its slowest pace since 1990, raising fears of a global slowdown and putting pressure on Beijing to end its bruising trade war with the US. Days after taking control of the state senate for the first time since 2010, New York Democrats have already passed new voting laws and LGBTQ protections, and are expected to introduce further progressive bills on issues such as abortion and marijuana legalisation. Listen to Today in Focus: What can we do about climate change? The planet is heating up even faster than previously thought, with extreme weather events becoming ever more common. The Guardian\u2019s global environment editor, Jonathan Watts, explains what must be done to keep global warming to a maximum of 1.5C. Must-reads Glenn Close: \u2018I\u2019ll be incredibly nervous when they open the envelope\u2019 Glenn Close is closing in on an Oscar for her performance as an overlooked literary spouse in The Wife. She tells Ryan Gilbey she was \u201cfloored\u201d by the response to her eloquent and moving acceptance speech at the Golden Globes. The exhausting task of tracking Trump\u2019s lies Since he took office two years ago, Trump has made some 7,645 \u201cfalse or misleading claims\u201d. Adam Gabbatt talks to the professional fact checkers about the \u201call-consuming task\u201d of tracking the president\u2019s lies and fabrications. Are late nights and lie-ins giving you \u2018social jetlag\u2019? Sleeping in at the weekend could be causing you \u201csocial jetlag\u201d, a condition that experts say may contribute to weight gain, reduced mental performance and even chronic illness. Linda Geddes hears from the German professor who coined the term. How Native Americans shaped rock music Link Wray\u2019s Rumble is the only instrumental track ever banned from American radio, for fear it would incite youth violence. A new documentary, named after that track, explores the little-understood influence on rock music of Native Americans like Wray. Opinion Half a century after his death, Martin Luther King Jr has become an uncontroversial figure, celebrated by everyone from progressives to the president. But if we truly want to honour his legacy, says Bhaskar Sunkara, we must remember that he was a radical. The real Martin Luther King Jr stood for a radical vision of equality, justice, and anti-militarism that rebelled against Reagan\u2019s entire agenda. Today more than ever, we need to rediscover that champion of working people. Sport The Greek prodigy Stefanos Tsitsipas knocked out the defending champion, Roger Federer, to reach the Australian Open quarter-finals. In the women\u2019s contest, Serena Williams beat the world number one Simona Halep to claim her place in the last eight. Mohamed Salah reached a landmark 50 Premier League goals during Liverpool\u2019s defeat of Crystal Palace on Saturday, but took the shine off his own achievement with his theatrical attempts to win a penalty.

The plans are part of Brexit preparations launched by the French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, in Calais on Friday, in response to more than a year\u2019s campaigning by the region\u2019s president, Xavier Bertrand. Digging has already begun at Coquelles, the site of the Eurotunnel exit, with funds contributed by its parent company, Getlink. Under EU rules, animals, fresh food and agri-feed from Britain will be classified as being from a \u201cthird country\u201d post Brexit, with checks for disease, traceability, rules of origin and welfare mandatory on the French side. And although work has yet to start, land for a temporary border inspection post involving customs and sanitary checks has been commandeered at the Transmark fuel stop in Calais off the A16, the main artery between the town and Dunkirk. Planning for border operations on the British side of the Channel is less advanced because of the continuing uncertainty over the possibility of no deal. The UK transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has also declared that there would be no border checks at Dover when Britain leaves the EU in March, calling controls \u201cutterly unrealistic\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The crowd at San Siro was the smallest it had been for any game in this Serie A season, yet also perhaps the most uplifting. Inter\u2019s match against Sassuolo was originally supposed to be played behind closed doors, as a punishment for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/26/carlo-ancelotti-slams-racist-chanting-napoli-kalidou-koulibaly\">racist abuse of Kalidou Koulibaly</a> by supporters at the stadium last month. Club officials persuaded the footballing authorities to let them distribute 11,000 tickets to schoolchildren instead.</p> \n<p>They filled a part of the stadium\u2019s lower tier, with the remaining seats covered over by gigantic banners upon which \u2018BUU\u2019 had been printed in various fonts. That spelling is used by Italian journalists to represent monkey noises directed at black players during games. Inter were inviting us to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Inter_en/status/1086228637689483265\">reinvent the letters as an acronym</a> \u2013 to be written, not said \u2013 \u2018Brothers Universally United\u2019 against discrimination.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Inter_en/status/1086228637689483265\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Write and share your BUU so it's never heard again.

Such a convivial atmosphere stood in contrast not only to that game against Napoli but also the stark silence of Inter\u2019s Coppa Italia win over Benevento on 13 January \u2013 when the full stadium ban was in force.</p> \n<p>Sadly, neither team could give the kids a goal to celebrate.

Muriel was unfortunate to join Sevilla in what would become a period of constant upheaval, the club rotating through four managers in less than a year, but he also frustrated fans with erratic performances and drew criticism for his fluctuating weight. He had played just six league games this season, and only one as a starter.</p> \n<p>His impact for Fiorentina, however, would be immediate.

The game had turned against Fiorentina in the interim. Edimilson Fernandes was sent off for a second booking and Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez equalised before the interval.</p> \n<p>The visitors were pressing for a second goal, when Federico Chiesa played a ball out of defence towards Muriel on the edge of the centre circle. The Colombian took one touch to spin past Joachim Andersen and one more to evade the challenge of Nicola Murru. Nobody else could catch him as he sprinted half the length of the pitch to finish across the goalkeeper once again.</p> \n<p>For Fiorentina supporters, it was a goal that evoked memories of Roberto Baggio\u2019s coast-to-coast <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NKgSpfeSuA\">against Napoli in 1989</a>. Still, Muriel would only hold his hands up in apology. An act of deference towards Sampdoria\u2019s fans, but perhaps also their manager, Marco Giampaolo, whom he credits as the first coach ever to truly show faith in him.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NKgSpfeSuA\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6NKgSpfeSuA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Muriel chose Fiorentina ahead of Milan this January in part because he got the sense that Stefano Pioli might become the second. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who reminds me of Ronaldo, <em>O Fenomeno</em>,\u201d the manager is reported to have told him. \u201cNow prove it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sunday\u2019s game represented a pretty good start, even if it still was not enough to secure three points.

      "bodyText": "The crowd at San Siro was the smallest it had been for any game in this Serie A season, yet also perhaps the most uplifting. Inter\u2019s match against Sassuolo was originally supposed to be played behind closed doors, as a punishment for racist abuse of Kalidou Koulibaly by supporters at the stadium last month. Club officials persuaded the footballing authorities to let them distribute 11,000 tickets to schoolchildren instead. They filled a part of the stadium\u2019s lower tier, with the remaining seats covered over by gigantic banners upon which \u2018BUU\u2019 had been printed in various fonts. That spelling is used by Italian journalists to represent monkey noises directed at black players during games. Inter were inviting us to reinvent the letters as an acronym \u2013 to be written, not said \u2013 \u2018Brothers Universally United\u2019 against discrimination. The young audience cheered both teams: showing a great enthusiasm for attacking football in general. Such a convivial atmosphere stood in contrast not only to that game against Napoli but also the stark silence of Inter\u2019s Coppa Italia win over Benevento on 13 January \u2013 when the full stadium ban was in force. Sadly, neither team could give the kids a goal to celebrate. Saturday\u2019s game finished 0-0, with Sassuolo enjoying slightly the better chances. There was no shortage of scoring elsewhere, though. After its grim end to 2018, Serie A returned from the winter break with an entertaining round of games: from Roma\u2019s helter-skelter 3-2 win over Torino to Atalanta\u2019s 5-0 rout of Frosinone and a defiant 2-1 victory for a short-staffed Napoli over Lazio. If those kids in the stands at San Siro offered hope for the future, then so too did a 19-year-old on the pitch at the Stadio Olimpico, Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo climbing off his backside to improvise an opening goal for the Giallorossi. His namesake Nicol\u00f2 Barella, 21, has been running games for Cagliari all season but highlighted his performance against Empoli with some precocious acts of individualism as well. Most absorbing of all was the match between Fiorentina and Sampdoria at the Stadio Artemio Franchi. Both teams begin 2019 with aspirations of qualifying for Europe, or perhaps even \u2013 given the underwhelming form of Lazio, Milan and Roma \u2013 of seizing a place in the top four. Toward that end, Fiorentina signed Luis Muriel on loan from Sevilla at the start of this month. The Viola had been frustrating to watch in the first half of this campaign: a young team blessed with abundant creative talent but lacking the quality up front to capitalise on it. Only Torino, in the top half, had scored fewer. Muriel might seem a curious choice in that regard.

The company\u2019s vice-president for policy and communications, Victoria Grand, announced the policy at an event in Jakarta on Monday, Reuters reported. The five-recipient limit was initially put in place in India last July. A larger limit, of 20 recipients, was put in place globally. WhatsApp said at the time the limits would \u201chelp keep WhatsApp the way it was designed to be: a private messaging app\u201d. Carl Woog, the head of communications at WhatsApp, told the Guardian on Monday: \u201cWe settled on five because we believe this is a reasonable number to reach close friends while helping prevent abuse.\u201d In India, WhatsApp\u2019s largest market with more than 200 million users, action was taken after a spate of at least 30 lynchings across the country that were blamed on incendiary messages spread using the app. The mob killings, which often followed fevered warnings that child kidnappers were targeting a particular village or city, were not a new phenomenon in India but analysts said inflammatory rumours were being spread faster and more widely than in the past. The limit was introduced last summer along with another feature to clearly label forwarded messages and the removal of a quick-forward button next to images, video and audio clips.

      "body": "<p>Martin Luther King Jr is useful to just about everyone nowadays. For President Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-signing-proclamation-honor-dr-martin-luther-king-jr-day/\">celebrating King</a> is a chance to tell everyone that he shares \u201chis dream of equality, freedom, justice, and peace\u201d. For Ram trucks, it\u2019s a chance to, well, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7d00CbNbWmM\">sell trucks</a>.</p> \n<p>This wasn\u2019t always the case. In 1983, 15 years after King\u2019s death, 22 senators voted against an official holiday honoring him on the third Monday in January. The North Carolina senator Jesse Helms undertook a 16-day filibuster of the bill, <a href=\"https://ww.nytimes.com/1983/10/04/us/king-holiday-bill-faces-a-filibuster.html\">claiming</a> that King\u2019s \u201caction-oriented Marxism\u201d was \u201cnot compatible with the concepts of this country\u201d. He was joined in his opposition by Senators John McCain, Orrin Hatch and Chuck Grassley, among others.</p> \n<p>Reagan reluctantly signed the legislation, all the while grumbling that he would have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/opinions/articles/solemn_senate_votes_for_national_holiday.html\">preferred</a> \u201ca day similar to Lincoln\u2019s birthday, which is not technically a national holiday\u201d.</p> \n<p>And guess what? He had a reason to be hesitant. The real Martin Luther King Jr stood for a radical vision of equality, justice and anti-militarism that rebelled against Reagan\u2019s entire agenda. Today more than ever, we need to rediscover that champion of working people.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/05/bell-tolls-39-times-to-commemorate-martin-luther-king-jrs-death\">Martin Luther King's death commemorated with 39 bell tolls in Memphis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Disneyified version of Dr King begins and ends with his role as a civil rights leader, who summoned Christian teachings, as well as Gandhian tactics, and told us of his dream that \u201cone day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \u2018We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>But in that same oft-quoted I Have a Dream speech from 1963, King celebrated the \u201cmarvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community\u201d and spoke of the \u201cfierce urgency of now\u201d. For his own militancy, King was hounded by the FBI, denounced as a communist and bombarded with death threats. Only 22% of Americans approved of the <a href=\"https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/freedom-rides\">Freedom Rides</a> fighting segregated transportation. By the mid-1960s, 63% of Americans had an unfavorable opinion of King, according to polls.</p> \n<p>Martin Luther King Jr was a part of a much wider movement, standing alongside socialists such as Ella Baker, Bayard Rustin, and A Philip Randolph in not just attempting to dismantle the Jim Crow system, but replacing it with an egalitarian social democracy.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"db1d4e9e-2bac-43c5-821e-1a8e2320e702\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e49VEpWg61M?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Despite President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s shepherding of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, ending legal apartheid in the United States, King became even more radical as the decade went on. As he put it in 1967: \u201cWe aren\u2019t merely struggling to integrate a lunch counter now.

      "bodyText": "Martin Luther King Jr is useful to just about everyone nowadays. For President Donald Trump, celebrating King is a chance to tell everyone that he shares \u201chis dream of equality, freedom, justice, and peace\u201d. For Ram trucks, it\u2019s a chance to, well, sell trucks. This wasn\u2019t always the case. In 1983, 15 years after King\u2019s death, 22 senators voted against an official holiday honoring him on the third Monday in January. The North Carolina senator Jesse Helms undertook a 16-day filibuster of the bill, claiming that King\u2019s \u201caction-oriented Marxism\u201d was \u201cnot compatible with the concepts of this country\u201d. He was joined in his opposition by Senators John McCain, Orrin Hatch and Chuck Grassley, among others. Reagan reluctantly signed the legislation, all the while grumbling that he would have preferred \u201ca day similar to Lincoln\u2019s birthday, which is not technically a national holiday\u201d. And guess what? He had a reason to be hesitant. The real Martin Luther King Jr stood for a radical vision of equality, justice and anti-militarism that rebelled against Reagan\u2019s entire agenda. Today more than ever, we need to rediscover that champion of working people. The Disneyified version of Dr King begins and ends with his role as a civil rights leader, who summoned Christian teachings, as well as Gandhian tactics, and told us of his dream that \u201cone day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \u2018We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.\u2019\u201d But in that same oft-quoted I Have a Dream speech from 1963, King celebrated the \u201cmarvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community\u201d and spoke of the \u201cfierce urgency of now\u201d. For his own militancy, King was hounded by the FBI, denounced as a communist and bombarded with death threats. Only 22% of Americans approved of the Freedom Rides fighting segregated transportation. By the mid-1960s, 63% of Americans had an unfavorable opinion of King, according to polls. Martin Luther King Jr was a part of a much wider movement, standing alongside socialists such as Ella Baker, Bayard Rustin, and A Philip Randolph in not just attempting to dismantle the Jim Crow system, but replacing it with an egalitarian social democracy. Despite President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s shepherding of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, ending legal apartheid in the United States, King became even more radical as the decade went on. As he put it in 1967: \u201cWe aren\u2019t merely struggling to integrate a lunch counter now. We\u2019re struggling to get some money to be able to buy a hamburger or a steak when we get to the counter.\u201d King wasn\u2019t willing to drop his internationalist commitments to achieve this change. He had long been a supporter of anti-colonial struggles in developing countries and in an April 1967 address at Riverside church in Harlem, he alienated his liberal allies by challenging the slaughter in Vietnam and the broader system of imperialism that made poor people, black and white alike, \u201ckill and die together for a nation that has been unable to seat them together in the same schools\u201d. Despite rebukes from more than 160 newspaper editorials the next day and his permanent alienation from liberal allies in the Democratic party, he pressed on. Now calling himself a democratic socialist, through his Poor People\u2019s Campaign, King was set to create the kind of movement that could fight for not just political but economic freedom for all. He wasn\u2019t just a civil rights activist, he was a tribune for a multiracial working class \u2013 people who faced poverty, racism and joblessness, but who when banded together could wield tremendous power. King traveled to Memphis in April 1968, where he was assassinated by the white supremacist James Earl Ray, to support striking sanitation workers. His advisers warned against the trip. There were the threats of his life, and there were other campaigns and commitments too. But King knew he had to be there. He knew what side he was on.

      "bodyText": "Democrats finally have full control of New York state government, and they\u2019re wasting no time putting it to use. In just the first few days of this year\u2019s legislative session \u2013 after Democrats in November won control of the state senate - lawmakers have passed a major overhaul of the state\u2019s voting laws, and new protections for gay and transgender New Yorkers. It\u2019s a big change in Albany, the state capital, where for years progressives got used to seeing their priorities wither and die in the Republican-controlled senate. Despite New York\u2019s reputation as a Democratic bastion, states like California went much further in passing legislation to protect immigrants and the environment and combat the policies of Donald Trump. So when senate majority leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the first woman to hold the job, kicked off the legislative session at a press conference last week, she opened with a familiar plea: \u201cWe urge our Republican colleagues to take up our bills.\u201d The room erupted in laughter, and Stewart-Cousins threw her hands in the air in triumph. \u201cI\u2019m just kidding,\u201d she said. Lawmakers then voted to allow ten days of early voting, which New York had been one of only 13 states to prohibit. They voted to amend the constitution to allow same day voter registration, and let voters get absentee ballots with no excuse. Those amendments require approval in a statewide referendum. The aim is to increase voter turnout that is among the worst in the nation and ease frequent election day meltdowns at the polls. Lawmakers also voted to tighten campaign finance laws, closing the notorious \u201cLLC loophole,\u201d which allowed donors to give virtually unlimited sums by creating multiple corporations. The next day, they passed bills to prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity, add transgender New Yorkers to hate crime laws, and ban gay conversion therapy for minors. The early burst of activity is a shift from past years, when progressive advocates were accustomed to making their way to Albany as the legislative session neared its end, staging protests, waiting out late nights of legislative wrangling, and returning mostly empty handed. The list of pent up priorities is long: legalizing marijuana, extending the statute of limitation for child sex abuse victims to sue, ending cash bail, overhauling rent regulations, codifying Roe v Wade\u2019s abortion rights protections into state law, granting driver\u2019s licenses to undocumented immigrants. \u201cThey\u2019ve been waiting for this moment,\u201d said Christina Greer, a political science professor at Fordham University. Of course, it could still end badly. The last time the Democrats controlled the Senate, briefly, it collapsed in chaos amid a leadership coup involving a number of lawmakers later jailed for corruption. Already, rifts have emerged over how to raise money to fix New York\u2019s crumbling subway system. Transit advocates favor congestion pricing, which would charge drivers to enter the most crowded parts of Manhattan, but plenty of suburban and outer borough Democrats disagree. The bills passed so far have been matters of consensus among Democrats. But a tougher fight is expected over the effort to make it more difficult for landlords to raise rents in New York City, opposed by real estate interests who have donated generously to members of both parties. And while most Democrats agree in concept that marijuana should be legalized, a fight is likely over whether to expunge past convictions, and what to do with the new tax revenue raised. At the center of upcoming fights will be Governor Andrew Cuomo, who many on the left have long eyed warily, accusing him of enabling a rogue Democratic faction that kept the Republicans in control of the Senate, whose members were soundly defeated in last year\u2019s primaries.

Kelly\u2019s long-term record label, RCA, a subsidiary of Sony, this weekend announced that it was terminating its relationship with the singer. The documentary prompted protests outside Sony\u2019s New York headquarters last week. The action followed a wave of disavowals from the embattled star. Kelly\u2019s daughter, Buku Abi, described him as \u201ca monster\u201d. Stars including Lady Gaga and C\u00e9line Dion have removed their duets with Kelly from streaming platforms. The French band Phoenix apologised for inviting Kelly to perform with them at the 2013 Coachella festival. Kelly\u2019s ex-manager, Henry James Mason, turned himself into police in Georgia after a warrant was issued for his arrest for allegedly making \u201cterroristic threats and acts\u201d against the family of Joycelyn Savage, whose family claim that she has been brainwashed by Kelly and is being held captive in his alleged \u201ccult\u201d. Prosecutors in Chicago and Atlanta are appealing for new information about Kelly\u2019s alleged abuses. Throughout 2017 and 2018, Kelly was accused of holding five women in a sex \u201ccult\u201d, with a former girlfriend alleging that he had sexual contact with girls as young as 14. In October, his ex-wife Andrea Kelly accused him of domestic violence. Earlier in his career, he was tried and acquitted on child pornography charges. Kelly has long denied any wrongdoing, even recording a song professing his innocence, singing: \u201cI\u2019m so falsely accused.\u201d",

But despite crushing Venus Williams in the third round two days ago, seeing off Serena Williams is going to be a much harder task for Simona Halep. Williams might be the world No16, but don\u2019t let her ranking fool you. She\u2019s 37 years old, but don\u2019t let her age fool you. There\u2019s no doubt that Williams remains the most feared player around. She\u2019s cruised into the fourth round for the loss of just nine games and didn\u2019t lose a set in the first week; those are the numbers that deserve your attention.</p> \n  <p>That said, this is going to be a much better test of the American great\u2019s level than anything she\u2019s encountered so far. Halep isn\u2019t the greatest player of all time, unlike her opponent today, but she is the current world No1 and banished much of the self-doubt that used to grip her game by winning the French Open last year. The Romanian had a couple of scares in the first week, dropping sets to Kaia Kanepi and Sofia Kenin, but she was faultless against Venus and it certainly won\u2019t be a shock if she wins this one, even though Serena leads 8-1 in their head-to-head. It isn\u2019t an easy one to call. You probably have to give Williams the slight edge, but this is a match worthy of a final. Let\u2019s just hope the tennis lives up to the hype. </p> \n  <p><strong>Play begins at: </strong>8am GMT, 7pm in Melbourne.</p> \n </div> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell in Melbourne. Thanks for reading. Novak Djokovic versus Daniil Medvedev is underway. Follow it here. The reward for Serena Williams is a quarter-final against Karolina Pliskova, the seventh seed. Pliskova beat Williams in the US Open in 2016 - but Williams turned the tables on the Czech at Flushing Meadows last year. The American will start as the heavy favourite, though Pliskova will have a chance with her big serve. Serena Williams speaks! \u201cIt was an intense match and there were some incredible points. But I love playing tennis. It\u2019s really cool to be back out playing on this court. I really needed to elevate my game. She\u2019s the number one player in the world. I\u2019m such a fighter. I just never give up. It\u2019s definitely something that\u2019s innate. It\u2019s a miracle I\u2019m here and I get to do something I enjoy. This is my job and it\u2019s a super pleasure. That keeps me motivated and keep fighting for every point.\u201d Serving to stay in the match, Williams falls to 0-15 after a tight error. Halep isn\u2019t going anywhere just yet. A brutal rally ensues - but Williams wins it with a brilliant forehand. Then she makes it 30-15 with a quick serve, before earning two match points with a marvellous backhand from left to right. Halep goes for broke - but it\u2019s all over when she sends a forehand long! That\u2019s it! The world No1\u2019s out after a titanic tussle. They share a warm embrace at the net - it was a spectacular match in the end. Third set: Halep* 1-6, 6-4, 4-5 Williams (*denotes server): Serving to stay in the match, Halep\u2019s relieved to make it 40-0. She sends a backhand down the line to hold to love and give herself a fighting chance. Third set: Halep 1-6, 6-4, 3-5 Williams* (*denotes server): Looking to consolidate the crucial break, Williams is happy with a 30-0 lead. Halep, a little forlorn now, sends a forehand long for 40-0. She holds to 15 and moves a game away from the quarter-finals. Third set: Halep* 1-6, 6-4, 3-4 Williams (*denotes server): The game goes to 30-all, Halep the one to feel the pressure now. She\u2019s relieved to see Williams knock a forehand return just wide. But the game goes to deuce - and Williams punishes a second serve with a forehand return. Break point. Williams steps it up - and Halep nets a tame forehand! Third set: Halep 1-6, 6-4, 3-3 Williams* (*denotes server): Halep keeps hitting it deep, keeps throwing her punches, and makes it 0-30 with a glorious forehand at the end of another dynamite rally. Williams needs her serve: it helps her to 30-all. But Halep won\u2019t give her a moment\u2019s peace now. She hustles across the baseline, defends brilliantly and forces Williams to net. 30-40. Break point. Williams looks stunned - but a huge first serve makes it deuce. This is turning into an epic. On the run, Halep rips a stonking forehand down the line to earn a second break point and leave Williams flailing. Yet Williams throws Halep a deep, awkward high ball and the Romanian, her balance off, hooks a forehand wide. There\u2019s no respite for Williams, though, Halep attacking a second serve and earning a third chance with a backhand winner. Williams responds with an ace out wide. She holds with a venomous forehand down the line. Third set: Halep* 1-6, 6-4, 3-2 Williams (*denotes server): Williams is annoyed with herself after dropping a backhand wide for 15-0. It goes to 30-0 and then Halep makes it 40-0 with a mishit forehand. She holds to love. Third set: Halep 1-6, 6-4, 2-2 Williams* (*denotes server): Williams makes it 40-0 with her seventh ace of the match. Another top serve is enough for a love hold. Third set: Halep* 1-6, 6-4, 2-1 Williams (*denotes server): Halep rolls into a 40-0 lead. What a change it\u2019s been from the first set. She holds to love when Williams drops a forehand wide. Third set: Halep 1-6, 6-4, 1-1 Williams* (*denotes server): The game starts with a punishing rally, which ends with Williams losing it with a dreadful drop shot for 0-15. The game goes to 30-all. Williams double-faults at 40-30. Deuce. But Williams finds her serve and holds. Third set: Halep* 1-6, 6-4, 1-0 Williams (*denotes server): Into a decider we go, with Halep serving first, and serving well. Her first serves are landing and that\u2019s giving her room to breathe. But just when it seems this game\u2019s done, with Halep up 40-15, Williams fights to deuce - and earns a break point with a pinpoint forehand. Halep responds with a forehand down the line, enough to force Williams to stoop and net a backhand. She holds, dominating from the baseline, Williams the one to look unsteady on her feet this time. Serving to stay in the set, Williams is under pressure at 0-30. Williams uses her serve to fight back to 30-all. But Halep earns a set point with a precise winner down the line! Williams misses a serve down the middle. They rally off a second serve. Halep stays firm, repelling everything - and Williams cracks, dragging a backhand wide! What fight from the world No1, who looked down and out half an hour ago! Second set: Halep* 1-6, 5-4 Williams (*denotes server): Halep holds to 15. Well, Williams will have to serve to stay in the set. Second set: Halep 1-6, 4-4 Williams* (*denotes server): Williams looks in control at 40-0. Halep fights back to 40-30. But Williams puts a stop to any funny business with an ace. Second set: Halep* 1-6, 4-3 Williams (*denotes server): Williams is annoyed after another net cord goes Halep\u2019s way. A little frustration\u2019s rising in the American. That\u2019s all the encouragement Halep needs to make off with the game, holding to 15 with an ace down the middle. Second set: Halep 1-6, 3-3 Williams* (*denotes server): Williams knuckles down, holding to 15. Second set: Halep* 1-6, 3-2 Williams (*denotes server): Remembering that she\u2019s the world No1, Halep skips into a 40-0 lead. She polishes off her first love hold with a backhand down the line. This is impressively gutsy from Halep, who easily could have crumbled after that torrid first set. But she\u2019s kept in mind that Williams could hardly have played better. Second set: Halep 1-6, 2-2 Williams* (*denotes server): Halep musters some resistance, drilling a forehand down the line for 30-40. Williams cancels out the break point with an ace. But Halep keeps fighting. Another chance comes her way - and Williams nets a backhand! Second set: Halep* 1-6, 1-2 Williams (*denotes server): Halep\u2019s grateful for a lucky net cord going her way at 0-15; she needs everything she can get. But Williams is relentless. Two break points come her way and she converts the first with a blistering forehand return. Second set: Halep 1-6, 1-1 Williams* (*denotes server): Williams rams a backhand down the line to hold to love. Just stunning. Second set: Halep* 1-6, 1-0 Williams (*denotes server): On it goes, Williams starting set two with a lovely volley for 0-15. Halep makes herself feel better with her first ace of the match. Williams responds to that with a brilliant backhand lob. Halep scampers back to retrieve it, but her reward is to see a forehand fizz back past her for 15-30. Somehow Halep digs deep, finding her best tennis to move to 40-30. Can she hold? Yes! A superb forehand gets her off the mark at last. Maybe this isn\u2019t over yet. In the blink of an eye, Williams has three set points. An ace does the job. That was a spectacular set from the 16th seed. She\u2019s only taken 20 minutes to make the world No1 look very ordinary indeed. First set: Halep* 1-5 Williams (*denotes server): It\u2019s a demolition job so far from Williams, who is hounding Halep at every turn, pulling the Romanian all over the place and forcing so many desperate errors from her. Halep, looking for a solution, sends a hopeful forehand wide to make it 0-40. Williams botches the first two, but it\u2019s only a matter of time. A crushing forehand return does the job. First set: Halep 1-4 Williams* (*denotes server): Back comes Halep, returning well to make it 0-30. But Williams stays cool, leaning on her serve to win the next four points and hold to 30, consolidating the break. The set will be all but over if Halep can\u2019t hold now. First set: Halep* 1-3 Williams (*denotes server): You sense that Halep doesn\u2019t have a strong enough serve to deal with the power coming at her from the other end of the court. Williams is really going after her second serve and moves into a 15-30 lead with more venomous hitting. It\u2019s not long before Williams has two break points. She takes the first when Halep sends a backhand long. This feels ominous. First set: Halep 1-2 Williams* (*denotes server): This is brilliant from Williams, a series of controlled but brutal groundstrokes taking her into a 40-0 lead, Halep nowhere near any of them. Williams holds to 30. First set: Halep* 1-1 Williams (*denotes server): After that fast start from Halep, Williams looks to respond in kind. She moves into a 0-30 lead and earns three break points with a coruscating forehand return. Halep challenges in vain. 0-40. Halep saves the first two, but Williams takes control on the third, penetrating Halep\u2019s defences with a big forehand before polishing off the point at the net to break back straight away. First set: Halep 1-0 Williams* (*denotes server): It\u2019s Serena Williams to open the serving. But it\u2019s Simona Halep who comes hurtling out of the blocks, racing into a 0-30 lead. The Romanian\u2019s in the zone here, showing plenty of aggression and ramming a forehand down the line to earn three break points in double quick time. Williams\u2019s response? A double fault. Crikey. Halep breaks to love. The players are out on court. We\u2019ll have tennis soon! Novak Djokovic and Daniil Medvedev meet on Rod Laver Arena once Serena Williams and Simona Halep are done. Meanwhile Borna Coric and Lucas Pouille have split the first two sets in their fourth-round match, while Kei Nishikori and Pablo Carreno Busta are playing out a tight first set. So what\u2019s happened so far today? I\u2019ll tell ya! Elina Svitolina beat Madison Keys 6-2, 1-6, 6-1 and the fifth seed has a quarter-final against US Open champion Naomi Osaka, who saw off Anastasija Sevastova 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. The winner of this match, meanwhile, will play Karolina Pliskova, who\u2019s thumped Garbine Muguruza. On the men\u2019s side Milos Raonic destroyed Alexander Zverev, who responded by destroying his racket. Raonic is a former semi-finalist here, so it\u2019s not such a surprise that the 16th seed won that one - but Zverev is the world No4 and we\u2019re still waiting for him to win a big match at a grand slam. Hello. One sister down, one more to go. But despite crushing Venus Williams in the third round two days ago, seeing off Serena Williams is going to be a much harder task for Simona Halep. Williams might be the world No16, but don\u2019t let her ranking fool you. She\u2019s 37 years old, but don\u2019t let her age fool you. There\u2019s no doubt that Williams remains the most feared player around. She\u2019s cruised into the fourth round for the loss of just nine games and didn\u2019t lose a set in the first week; those are the numbers that deserve your attention. That said, this is going to be a much better test of the American great\u2019s level than anything she\u2019s encountered so far. Halep isn\u2019t the greatest player of all time, unlike her opponent today, but she is the current world No1 and banished much of the self-doubt that used to grip her game by winning the French Open last year. The Romanian had a couple of scares in the first week, dropping sets to Kaia Kanepi and Sofia Kenin, but she was faultless against Venus and it certainly won\u2019t be a shock if she wins this one, even though Serena leads 8-1 in their head-to-head. It isn\u2019t an easy one to call. You probably have to give Williams the slight edge, but this is a match worthy of a final. Let\u2019s just hope the tennis lives up to the hype. Play begins at: 8am GMT, 7pm in Melbourne.",

      "bodyText": "The last time Serena Williams came to Melbourne, she was five weeks pregnant and went on to win the Australian Open for the seventh time. On day eight of the 2019 championships, two years older at 37, she dredged up a sliver of her old magic to hold off the robust challenge of the world No 1, Simona Halep, and edge closer to joining Margaret Court on the all-time record of 24 majors. It was a typically mercurial performance that swung between brilliant and desperate. To get another shot at the prize the remarkable American has to beat Karolina Pliskova in the quarter-final on Wednesday and either Naomi Osaka \u2013 who famously ignored her meltdown in the final at Flushing Meadows last September to win the US Open \u2013 or the sixth seed, Elina Svitolina. But she flirted with defeat on the eighth day of the tournament, saving three break points in the third just as Halep seemed to be taking charge. Williams, not at her best, dug deep, broke and held, and the win was hers 6-1, 4-6, 6-4 after an hour and 47 minutes on a mild evening in Rod Laver Arena. She said courtside: \u201cIt was a really intense match, with some incredible points. It\u2019s just great to be back out playing again on this court. I really needed to elevate my game.

I work so hard and it\u2019s just a miracle that I\u2019m here. I keep trying, fighting for every point.\u201d Williams was unusually subdued after the match, though she definitely has her game face on in the second week, after a ridiculously easy passage through her first three matches. She had given up nine games in those matches \u2013 a first-week strike rate she has not matched in a major since the 2013 US Open \u2013 but she had to step up in class from Dayana Yastremska and Eugenie Bouchard against Halep. The world No 1 and the real No 1 exchanged breaks at the start, before the American, who brought an 8-1 lead to their 10th encounter, pulled away to 4-1 inside quarter of an hour, and polished off the first set in 20 minutes.

      "bodyText": "The Syrian schoolboy who was filmed being attacked in a playground in Huddersfield is to take legal action against Facebook over claims by Tommy Robinson that he attacked English girls. Solicitors for the 16-year-old, who can be identified only as Jamal, said Facebook had given \u201cspecial status\u201d to the English Defence League founder to peddle false and defamatory lies about the schoolboy. Footage of the refugee student being pushed to the ground and having water poured on his face was watched millions of times and attracted widespread condemnation, including from Theresa May, in December. A 16-year-old boy, who cannot be identified, was charged with assault and appeared before a youth court last month. Hours after the video went viral last month, Robinson claimed on Facebook that Jamal had previously attacked three schoolgirls and a boy. The anti-Islam activist, whose real name in Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, reposted a screenshot of a message on his Facebook page from a mother claiming her daughter had been bullied. However, the mother later posted on Robinson\u2019s page denying that it was Jamal who had allegedly attacked her daughter. Jamal\u2019s solicitor, Tasnime Akunjee, also wrote to Robinson informing him that legal action was being pursued against him as the posts contained \u201ca number of false and defamatory allegations\u201d. After receiving the letter, Robinson admitted to his followers the claims were untrue and said he had been duped. \u201cI have been completely had, how embarrassing, man,\u201d he said. Jamal said he had been unable to go back to Almondbury Community school since the incident and that he feared for his safety because of what Robinson had said. \u201cI felt scared that people would think wrong about me because I hit girls when I didn\u2019t,\u201d he told the Daily Mail. \u201cI was scared because I feared people would attack me more because they would be believing in what Tommy Robinson said about me. \u201cI cannot go to my school any more and there are people who hang around outside my house and video me on their phones. They call me \u2018little rat\u2019 if I go outside. One of my neighbours threatened me outside my house just yesterday.\u201d Akunjee, of Farooq Bajwa and Co solicitors in London, said Facebook had given Robinson a \u201cspecial status\u201d and treated him differently from the average user by making \u201ceditorial decisions\u201d about his posts. It emerged last year that prominent figures such as Robinson are protected from the normal rules of moderation that would usually see a page removed after posting five or pieces of content that violates its rules. Akunjee said Facebook was therefore responsible for Robinson\u2019s posts and had given him \u201cspecial treatment [that] seems to be financially driven\u201d. Jamal\u2019s legal team is seeking to raise \u00a310,000 for the legal action against both Robinson and Facebook. To date, more than 130 people have pledged \u00a32,662 to the cause. After Jamal was attacked, more than 10,000 people donated about \u00a3150,000 to help relocate the boy and his family to a house outside Huddersfield.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s troubles in doubles. The seemingly innocuous observation by Jamie Murray that the widely respected specialist coach, Louis Cayer, deserves to be made national performance director across all disciplines has broken out into a full-blown feud with Dan Evans. Evans, who does not play much doubles, entered the debate just as it was dying when he told the Daily Mail: \u201cWho exactly has Louis Cayer ever coached apart from doubles players? Why would British tennis allow him to take charge? It\u2019s a ludicrous comment.\u201d He added, \u201cJamie thinks we should be celebrating six pairs inside the main draw of a grand slam? So we are celebrating people who didn\u2019t make it at singles and people who didn\u2019t have the attitude to work hard enough to make it in the singles game.\u201d But Murray, who is through to the quarter-finals here in both the men\u2019s doubles with Bruno Soares, and the mixed with Bethanie Mattek-Sands, hit back hard on Monday against his sometime Davis Cup partner and friend. \u201cIt is lazy comments to make. It is ill-informed and dumb really. To question the reason that we are on the doubles Tour is because we don\u2019t work as hard as the singles guys is just total nonsense. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing the Tour since 2007, travelling the world, working my ass off to stay at the top of the game and make a living for myself.

      "bodyText": "Not just a black comedy with a feisty feminist heart, the Oscar-tipped film The Favourite is packed with trends for 2019. \u201cAs well as looking at references and images from the period, I always look at fashion,\u201d says The Favourite\u2019s costume designer, Sandy Powell. \u201cThere is always something in contemporary fashion that is inspiring.\u201d We agree. So here are the film\u2019s most inspirational fashion moments. Armour up When Rachel Weisz\u2019s Duchess of Marlborough slowly puts Olivia Colman\u2019s Queen Anne in leather armour before a horse ride, it\u2019s not only a sexy woman-on-woman subdom leather fetish moment for the ages, but the logical conclusion of the autumn/winter 2018 \u201cfashion-as-armour\u201d trend as seen on the catwalk at Alexander McQueen. Monochrome matters One of the things that makes The Favourite such a visual feast is its gleefully non-period approach to wardrobe. Powell amped up the film\u2019s fashion cred by making bursting bodices black and white \u2013 monochrome being, of course, a perennial trend. Oscar de la Renta, Victoria Beckham and JW Anderson are fans for this spring \u2013 but, if you\u2019re more cosy than corset, head to Weekday for monochrome knitwear. Makeup for men In face powder, beauty patches and rouge, Nicholas Hoult\u2019s look couldn\u2019t be more on-trend today. Chanel and Tom Ford have led the man-slap vanguard lately, launching concealer, foundation and brow pencils for boys.

Denim for days In director Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s 18th century, the servants are so hip they all wear double denim \u2013 Powell used old cut-up jeans to make the women\u2019s bodices and skirts, and the men\u2019s britches and jackets.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Pool 1: Robson offers Wasps some consolation</strong></h2> \n<p>Dan Robson\u2019s performance for Wasps was one of the few shining lights on what was a difficult day for the home side, even if they avoided the thrashing they received in Dublin. He looks back to the kind of form he began the season in before the injury that denied him a first cap in autumn struck.Robson\u2019s try, selling Andrew Porter a fine dummy before racing to the line, was a demonstration of what he can bring, most likely off the bench, for England and Eddie Jones, who was watching in the stands. Bath can take heart from their performance in a scrappy match at Toulouse, even if the French side may have had a reason to avoid pressing for the bonus points. Both English sides have much to do in the Premiership, though, so will be somewhat relieved that forgettable European campaigns are over. <strong>Gerard Meagher</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/20/wasps-leinster-match-report\">Leinster cruise past Wasps and train sights on Ulster</a><strong><br></strong></p></li> \n</ul> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/20/irish-clubs-strength-saracens-european-final\">Irish clubs have strength in depth but Saracens can reach European final | Robert Kitson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <strong>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</strong>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Pool 2: Exeter find Europe a tougher nut to crack</strong></h2> \n<p>Eddie Jones remarked last week that rugby tended to oscillate between eras of contest and continuity, with the former currently in vogue. Exeter have based their success in the Premiership on being able to retain possession for long periods but have struggled to make the same impact in Europe where the breakdown is more of a contest. Their latest campaign came to grief at Thomond Park in a match that was unsparingly physical and played at a furious pace. Exeter were on the front foot for long periods but were undone by Tadhg Beirne at the breakdown. Munster\u2019s victory made it eight wins in nine for Irish sides over the Premiership ahead of Leinster\u2019s win at Wasps. <strong>Paul Rees</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/19/munster-exeter-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report\">Carbery helps Munster kick Chiefs out of Europe</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"459556e4-5bc2-4b2b-8a11-7db4aceec35f\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Champions Cup quarter-finals</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Saracens v Glasgow<br>Edinburgh v Munster<br><br>Racing 92 v Toulouse<br>Leinster v Ulster</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Challenge Cup quarter-finals</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Clermont Auvergne v Northampton<br>Worcester v Harlequins</b></p>\n    <p><b>Sale v Connacht<br>La Rochelle v Bristol</b></p>\n    <p><i>\u2022 All ties to be played 29/30/31 March</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Pool 3: Saracens look likeliest to down Leinster</strong></h2> \n<p>Saracens matched the pool tally of their first European title in 2016 with 28 points out of 30, a figure also achieved by Clermont and Harlequins in 2013. Only Biarritz have registered more, 29 in 2007. Second to them that season were Northampton, whom they drew in the quarter-finals. Northampton beat them. Second to Saracens here are Glasgow whom they play in the quarters in late March. Glasgow now are better than Northampton were then. Still, a Glasgow win would register as a significant upset. Saracens look the team best equipped to challenge Leinster. The Blues flickered but too fitfully. Lyon played the role of uninterested French team. <strong>Michael Aylwin</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/19/saracens-glasgow-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report\">Saracens into last eight as top seeds after beating Glasgow</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"012cfbaed8b3241d77e586bbab7ac92b0748388a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/012cfbaed8b3241d77e586bbab7ac92b0748388a/47_127_1911_1146/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tempers boiled over between players who will be reacquainted in March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tempers boil over between players who will be reacquainted in March.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Byrne/INPHO/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Pool 4: Ulster show Welsh teams how it\u2019s done</strong></h2> \n<p>For both Scarlets and Leicester to end up losing five of their six pool games is a sign of the European times. The Tigers have now failed to finish in the top half of their pool for three successive seasons; there is also no Welsh representation in the last eight of either of Europe\u2019s two competitions this season. Scarlets, gallant 46-33 losers in Paris in round six, scored the same number of pool tries as Ulster but the Irish province won no fewer than five matches en route to the quarter-finals. A free-wheeling Racing side are proving a spirited exception to the rule but, for the most part, a resilient set-piece and a tight, well-marshalled defence are key to success in the modern Europe. <strong>Robert Kitson</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/20/irish-clubs-strength-saracens-european-final\">Robert Kitson: Irish clubs have depth but Saracens can reach final</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>Pool 5: Edinburgh highlight Cockerill\u2019s credentials</strong></h2> \n<p>There would rarely be a dull moment if Richard Cockerill were appointed England\u2019s next head coach. It remains an unlikely proposition but Cockerill\u2019s work in the Scottish capital cannot be overstated.

      "bodyText": "Pool 1: Robson offers Wasps some consolation Dan Robson\u2019s performance for Wasps was one of the few shining lights on what was a difficult day for the home side, even if they avoided the thrashing they received in Dublin. He looks back to the kind of form he began the season in before the injury that denied him a first cap in autumn struck.Robson\u2019s try, selling Andrew Porter a fine dummy before racing to the line, was a demonstration of what he can bring, most likely off the bench, for England and Eddie Jones, who was watching in the stands. Bath can take heart from their performance in a scrappy match at Toulouse, even if the French side may have had a reason to avoid pressing for the bonus points. Both English sides have much to do in the Premiership, though, so will be somewhat relieved that forgettable European campaigns are over. Gerard Meagher Leinster cruise past Wasps and train sights on Ulster Pool 2: Exeter find Europe a tougher nut to crack Eddie Jones remarked last week that rugby tended to oscillate between eras of contest and continuity, with the former currently in vogue. Exeter have based their success in the Premiership on being able to retain possession for long periods but have struggled to make the same impact in Europe where the breakdown is more of a contest. Their latest campaign came to grief at Thomond Park in a match that was unsparingly physical and played at a furious pace. Exeter were on the front foot for long periods but were undone by Tadhg Beirne at the breakdown. Munster\u2019s victory made it eight wins in nine for Irish sides over the Premiership ahead of Leinster\u2019s win at Wasps. Paul Rees Carbery helps Munster kick Chiefs out of Europe Pool 3: Saracens look likeliest to down Leinster Saracens matched the pool tally of their first European title in 2016 with 28 points out of 30, a figure also achieved by Clermont and Harlequins in 2013. Only Biarritz have registered more, 29 in 2007. Second to them that season were Northampton, whom they drew in the quarter-finals. Northampton beat them. Second to Saracens here are Glasgow whom they play in the quarters in late March. Glasgow now are better than Northampton were then. Still, a Glasgow win would register as a significant upset. Saracens look the team best equipped to challenge Leinster. The Blues flickered but too fitfully. Lyon played the role of uninterested French team. Michael Aylwin Saracens into last eight as top seeds after beating Glasgow Pool 4: Ulster show Welsh teams how it\u2019s done For both Scarlets and Leicester to end up losing five of their six pool games is a sign of the European times. The Tigers have now failed to finish in the top half of their pool for three successive seasons; there is also no Welsh representation in the last eight of either of Europe\u2019s two competitions this season. Scarlets, gallant 46-33 losers in Paris in round six, scored the same number of pool tries as Ulster but the Irish province won no fewer than five matches en route to the quarter-finals. A free-wheeling Racing side are proving a spirited exception to the rule but, for the most part, a resilient set-piece and a tight, well-marshalled defence are key to success in the modern Europe. Robert Kitson Robert Kitson: Irish clubs have depth but Saracens can reach final Pool 5: Edinburgh highlight Cockerill\u2019s credentials There would rarely be a dull moment if Richard Cockerill were appointed England\u2019s next head coach. It remains an unlikely proposition but Cockerill\u2019s work in the Scottish capital cannot be overstated. Montpellier have a hulking pack but Edinburgh scrummaged them off the Murrayfield park and responded superbly to going behind early in the second half. They advance top of the pool and earn a home quarter-final to boot, a fine achievement considering the pool contained the three-times winners Toulon and a Newcastle side who won their first two matches.

      "bodyText": "A senior Labour MP leading a backbench effort to rule out a no-deal Brexit has argued that much of the government, including Theresa May, privately want this to happen, and are relying on parliament to take action. At the start of a political week in which the prime minister is likely to rule out any cross-party efforts to push ahead with a variation of her rejected Brexit plan, Yvette Cooper said it was time for MPs to act. Cooper, who chairs the home affairs select committee, is to table an amendment to a government motion on Monday which would seek to extend article 50 if a no-deal departure on 29 March was looking likely. The move is also the brainchild of the former Tory minister Nick Boles, and has backing from other senior Tories Sir Oliver Letwin and Nicky Morgan. Another backbench proposal from the former attorney general Dominic Grieve could lead to indicative votes being held in the Commons to scope out a consensus, or to the prioritising of proposals from a minority of 300 MPs from at least five parties. The junior business minister Richard Harrington urged May to rule out a no-deal Brexit, saying it would be an \u201cabsolute disaster\u201d for the UK. May held a conference call with her cabinet on Sunday evening and will make a statement to the Commons on Monday in which she is likely to announce that she will seek fresh concessions from Brussels before putting her plan to MPs again. Cooper conceded that the idea of backbenchers trying to exert their power was \u201cuncharted territory\u201d, but said her planned amendment was limited in scope. It would decree that if no agreement had passed parliament by the end of February, the government would have to bring forward a binding motion seeking an extension of article 50 \u201cso that we don\u2019t go crashing over the cliff edge\u201d, she said. Blaming May for consistently avoiding cross-party talks on Brexit since losing her majority in the 2017 election, Cooper said she believed much of the government wanted the extension option but could not seek it for political reasons. \u201cMy sense is that there are government ministers, including cabinet ministers, and I suspect even the prime minister herself, who want parliament to do this,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cShe knows that she should rule out no deal in the national interest, because it would be so damaging. She\u2019s refusing to do so, and I think she is hoping that parliament will do this for her. That is not leadership.\u201d Cooper said she believed the EU would extend article 50 if asked: \u201cI think they would take very seriously something that has come from parliament in this way. This would not be simply the prime minister just prevaricating and going round in circles.\u201d Speaking earlier on the programme, Harrington refused to rule out backing a proposal such as Cooper\u2019s. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the bill will be, or the mechanism. But all will change in the next couple of days.\u201d Harrington, who has pledged to resign if May pushes for a no-deal Brexit, said the option would be \u201can absolute disaster for the country, and it\u2019s supported by a minority of a minority of people\u201d. He said: \u201cShe should in my view say: \u2018We are responsible people, we are going to do our duty to Britons and we\u2019re going to rule out no deal.\u2019\u201d Asked why a no-deal Brexit concerned him, Harrington said: \u201cI\u2019m afraid of Jaguar closing, Mini closing, the life sciences industry closing, and all the other things, because we\u2019ve had no agreement that represents the way these businesses are integrated. It\u2019s irresponsibility and we\u2019ve got to stop it. \u201cI\u2019m not prepared to sell people down the river for other people\u2019s dogma.\u201d Stephen Laws, formerly the head government legislation lawyer, told Today he was concerned that backbench plans to control the Brexit process could cause a constitutional crisis. Arguing that parliamentary rules \u201cgive a clear veto to the government\u201d over any bills involving significant spending, Laws said that if MPs forced through a measure, May could ask the Queen to decline royal assent. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a fanciful speculation, because if the rules aren\u2019t applied as they should be, that\u2019s what will happen,\u201d he said.",

Its first half turns to Greek mythology to explore violent crimes against women and casts Zeus as he-man, ace swimmer and serial rapist. Yet the opening poem, on the dawning of female sexuality, gives no clue of what is to follow. It describes girls gathering on a tennis court:</p> <p><em>and sex wasn\u2019t here yet, but it was coming,</em><br><em>and we were running towards it,</em><br><em>its gorgeous euphoric mist;</em></p> <p>From ordinary virginal appetite, there is a fall, as through a trap door, into a poem resembling a crime scene: \u201cbullet-proof glass/and a speaker-phone between us/and still I wasn\u2019t safe\u201d. Zeus, however divine, seems dim but is no less frightening for that.

      "bodyText": "Vertigo &amp; Ghost is one of the darkest, bravest and most unsettling collections I have read in a while. Its first half turns to Greek mythology to explore violent crimes against women and casts Zeus as he-man, ace swimmer and serial rapist. Yet the opening poem, on the dawning of female sexuality, gives no clue of what is to follow. It describes girls gathering on a tennis court: and sex wasn\u2019t here yet, but it was coming, and we were running towards it, its gorgeous euphoric mist; From ordinary virginal appetite, there is a fall, as through a trap door, into a poem resembling a crime scene: \u201cbullet-proof glass/and a speaker-phone between us/and still I wasn\u2019t safe\u201d. Zeus, however divine, seems dim but is no less frightening for that. He communicates in bullying capital letters and gets his kicks, with a horrible jauntiness, out of \u201cthe moment before death\u201d. Whenever he waxes lyrical, he becomes frightening in a new way (we do not want this barbarian to sound like a poet): ITS VIOLET GRAINS DIMINISHING TO NOTHING LITTLE BIRD CUPPED IN THE HOLLOW OF MY PALM ITS TINY QUENCH \u2013 PHUT!

Leddy has been involved in enough hits (Brass Eye, The Inbetweeners, Derry Girls) to prove that her judgment is flawless, and she believed in the format enough to set Pile to work on the pilot in 1997. Pile brought Allen, Mackichan and Phillips on board and the team then had six tense but exhilarating months to develop their style. \u201cIt very much felt that a series was dependent on the quality of the pilot,\u201d says Phillips.</p> <p>The TV comedy of the time was dominated by another sketch show, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/may/22/fast-show-back-six-best-sketches\">The Fast Show</a>, in which Arabella Weir and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jul/04/sarah-morgan-caroline-aherne-tribute-comedy\">Caroline Aherne</a> were vastly outnumbered by men. The Smack the Pony team were determined to go their own way, leading to the formulation of some self-imposed rules: 1) No celebrity references, 2) No recurring characters and 3) No catchphrases. \u201cWe wanted to try and break from what had traditionally been female comedy which was exceedingly limited \u2026 French and Saunders, basically,\u201d says Mackichan. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want what was the traditional male format [and] staying away from overt stereotypes about women and periods, chocolate, diets etc was vehemently agreed by all at the onset.\u201d</p> <p>In place of all they had rejected, Smack the Pony featured the kind of observational humour that has always been the foundation of successful comedy, made fresh and surprising via a simple twist: the laughs came from a female perspective. Pile, who went on to create <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/sep/24/next-box-set-green-wing\">Green Wing</a> alongside some other STP alumni, says that even 20 years later it\u2019s these details she constantly thinks back to. \u201cI am always finding myself doing things that we identified on screen \u2013 drinking wine by the box, holding one\u2019s breasts whilst running up stairs, humming Fleetwood Mac whilst trying to park in a tight spot \u2026 \u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eac5c13af1f8f50010d9b55ea600359ecc490df1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eac5c13af1f8f50010d9b55ea600359ecc490df1/0_0_1330_795/1000.png\" alt=\"Singled out: the online dating sketch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"598\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Singled out: the online dating sketch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Youtube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The observational humour was also set alongside a thick strain of surrealist silliness that places <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jul/08/broadcasting.channel4\">Smack the Pony </a>within a more specifically British tradition. A short skit featuring Sally Phillips running a relay race in high heels might be STP\u2019s answer to Monty Python\u2019s Ministry of Silly Walks. And then there\u2019s Fiona Allen\u2019s favourite, The Matador and the Bull, about an unlikely cross-species romance: \u201cBeing half Spanish it was like performing with one of the family,\u201d she says. \u201cAlso, if l was going to die that day \u2013 health, safety and any form of protection was nowhere to be seen \u2013 ending up squashed by a bull in a matador\u2019s outfit from Madrid with sparkles would have been very funny.\u201d These two strands were also often brought together, as in the recurring Dating Agency Videos, an endlessly adaptable format for character comedy and home to some of the show\u2019s best-remembered oddballs (Mackichan\u2019s facelift denial is an oft-cited favourite). It is easy to trace a straight line from what Smack the Pony was doing 20 years ago to the more recent likes of Inside Amy Schumer, Fleabag and Broad City.</p> <p>STP also helped launch multiple comedy careers by accepting submissions from sketch writers outside its core team. Jesse Armstrong, Sam Bain, Richard Ayoade and John Oliver all have writing credits, while Orlando Bloom and Miranda Hart make early pre-fame appearances in a couple of sketches (Sally Phillips returned the favour by playing a supporting role in Hart\u2019s hit BBC One sitcom). \u201cIt was a brilliant outlet for writers, male or female, who didn\u2019t know where to voice their often fairly peculiar thoughts,\u201d says Pile. Crucially, though, it was the women who got all the best lines. \u201cThat was the overriding mission. Not to banner-wave or trash men, but to promote women as being as good as or better than! In the context of opportunities for funny women on TV at the time, this was a vital task.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT9zjAJcX9E\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XT9zjAJcX9E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It is this that seems to have made the deepest impression on the young, aspiring comedians watching at home. Standup Tessa Coates recalls acting out sketches, aged nine, with her six-year-old sister: \u201cI only remember us bringing down the house. I can see it now, me playing a surgeon, delivering news to a patient that I\u2019ve given her spoons for arms, with my sister hiding her arms inside her T-shirt and holding two wooden spoons so they stick out like arms. You can see why we were such a huge hit.\u201d While still at school, a teenage Lolly Adefope (Damned, Taskmaster) refused to let a YouTube ban on the library computers prevent her from watching clips during lunchtime. \u201cBeing a little hacker, I discovered the joy of \u2018proxies\u2019 and managed to find a back-end route. I remember watching the songs at the end of the episodes and realising that all my favourite things could be combined in a career: women, women being funny, and music videos. It definitely showed me that women could be so silly, and influenced what I try to do in my comedy.\u201d</p> <p>All Smack the Pony fans seem to agree that the show has hardly dated \u2013 but is this due to the depressing fact that life hasn\u2019t changed all that much for British women in the intervening years? Perhaps in part. The show featured a running gag about ogling attractive men in public that seems to work as an evergreen comment on sexual harassment, gender dynamics and the way ordinary female sexuality is cack-handedly co-opted by advertising \u2013 yet from the beginning the show\u2019s appeal was much wider than just \u201cfeminism, but funny\u201d. The first two series each won an Emmy and all three were nominated for a Bafta. Phillips, who went on to play the prime minister of Finland on HBO\u2019s Veep, says it\u2019s also travelled well. \u201cI\u2019ve found comedy writers in the States have watched them all and used our comedy as a reference point. The show was bigger in Scandinavia than here, too, and when I work there it usually comes up.\u201d</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, given the affection that still surrounds Smack the Pony, a reunion has been mooted every few years since the show first came off air in 2003. There was a retrospective as part of the BFI\u2019s Queens of TV Comedy season in 2012 and a Red Nose Day Special in 2017, but never a full series. With the Spice Girls embarking on their own comeback tour in May, could this be the year? Allen confirms they are \u201ccurrently working on reunion projects\u201d, and Phillips is even ready to share a few ideas: \u201cI think the time has perhaps come for an entirely period-based sketch show: The Big Red One. We used to joke about that. No, I\u2019m still joking.\u201d</p>",

The Smack the Pony team were determined to go their own way, leading to the formulation of some self-imposed rules: 1) No celebrity references, 2) No recurring characters and 3) No catchphrases. \u201cWe wanted to try and break from what had traditionally been female comedy which was exceedingly limited \u2026 French and Saunders, basically,\u201d says Mackichan. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want what was the traditional male format [and] staying away from overt stereotypes about women and periods, chocolate, diets etc was vehemently agreed by all at the onset.\u201d In place of all they had rejected, Smack the Pony featured the kind of observational humour that has always been the foundation of successful comedy, made fresh and surprising via a simple twist: the laughs came from a female perspective. Pile, who went on to create Green Wing alongside some other STP alumni, says that even 20 years later it\u2019s these details she constantly thinks back to. \u201cI am always finding myself doing things that we identified on screen \u2013 drinking wine by the box, holding one\u2019s breasts whilst running up stairs, humming Fleetwood Mac whilst trying to park in a tight spot \u2026 \u201d The observational humour was also set alongside a thick strain of surrealist silliness that places Smack the Pony within a more specifically British tradition. A short skit featuring Sally Phillips running a relay race in high heels might be STP\u2019s answer to Monty Python\u2019s Ministry of Silly Walks. And then there\u2019s Fiona Allen\u2019s favourite, The Matador and the Bull, about an unlikely cross-species romance: \u201cBeing half Spanish it was like performing with one of the family,\u201d she says. \u201cAlso, if l was going to die that day \u2013 health, safety and any form of protection was nowhere to be seen \u2013 ending up squashed by a bull in a matador\u2019s outfit from Madrid with sparkles would have been very funny.\u201d These two strands were also often brought together, as in the recurring Dating Agency Videos, an endlessly adaptable format for character comedy and home to some of the show\u2019s best-remembered oddballs (Mackichan\u2019s facelift denial is an oft-cited favourite). It is easy to trace a straight line from what Smack the Pony was doing 20 years ago to the more recent likes of Inside Amy Schumer, Fleabag and Broad City. STP also helped launch multiple comedy careers by accepting submissions from sketch writers outside its core team. Jesse Armstrong, Sam Bain, Richard Ayoade and John Oliver all have writing credits, while Orlando Bloom and Miranda Hart make early pre-fame appearances in a couple of sketches (Sally Phillips returned the favour by playing a supporting role in Hart\u2019s hit BBC One sitcom). \u201cIt was a brilliant outlet for writers, male or female, who didn\u2019t know where to voice their often fairly peculiar thoughts,\u201d says Pile. Crucially, though, it was the women who got all the best lines. \u201cThat was the overriding mission. Not to banner-wave or trash men, but to promote women as being as good as or better than! In the context of opportunities for funny women on TV at the time, this was a vital task.\u201d It is this that seems to have made the deepest impression on the young, aspiring comedians watching at home. Standup Tessa Coates recalls acting out sketches, aged nine, with her six-year-old sister: \u201cI only remember us bringing down the house. I can see it now, me playing a surgeon, delivering news to a patient that I\u2019ve given her spoons for arms, with my sister hiding her arms inside her T-shirt and holding two wooden spoons so they stick out like arms. You can see why we were such a huge hit.\u201d While still at school, a teenage Lolly Adefope (Damned, Taskmaster) refused to let a YouTube ban on the library computers prevent her from watching clips during lunchtime. \u201cBeing a little hacker, I discovered the joy of \u2018proxies\u2019 and managed to find a back-end route. I remember watching the songs at the end of the episodes and realising that all my favourite things could be combined in a career: women, women being funny, and music videos. It definitely showed me that women could be so silly, and influenced what I try to do in my comedy.\u201d All Smack the Pony fans seem to agree that the show has hardly dated \u2013 but is this due to the depressing fact that life hasn\u2019t changed all that much for British women in the intervening years? Perhaps in part. The show featured a running gag about ogling attractive men in public that seems to work as an evergreen comment on sexual harassment, gender dynamics and the way ordinary female sexuality is cack-handedly co-opted by advertising \u2013 yet from the beginning the show\u2019s appeal was much wider than just \u201cfeminism, but funny\u201d. The first two series each won an Emmy and all three were nominated for a Bafta. Phillips, who went on to play the prime minister of Finland on HBO\u2019s Veep, says it\u2019s also travelled well. \u201cI\u2019ve found comedy writers in the States have watched them all and used our comedy as a reference point. The show was bigger in Scandinavia than here, too, and when I work there it usually comes up.\u201d Unsurprisingly, given the affection that still surrounds Smack the Pony, a reunion has been mooted every few years since the show first came off air in 2003. There was a retrospective as part of the BFI\u2019s Queens of TV Comedy season in 2012 and a Red Nose Day Special in 2017, but never a full series. With the Spice Girls embarking on their own comeback tour in May, could this be the year? Allen confirms they are \u201ccurrently working on reunion projects\u201d, and Phillips is even ready to share a few ideas: \u201cI think the time has perhaps come for an entirely period-based sketch show: The Big Red One. We used to joke about that. No, I\u2019m still joking.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It is nothing less than despicable that, when our opposition and our government can clearly see they need to work together to get us out of this Brexit chaos, they are refusing to do so. And that means Theresa May could quite conceivably allow Britain to exit the EU without a deal, without any serious plans in place, and without reference to parliament. To prevent a no-deal outcome requires MPs to proactively replace this legal default position with something else. If the court case I brought against the government over article 50 was about anything at all, it was about parliamentary sovereignty. That meant the will of the overwhelming majority of our MPs should prevail on the major issues of the day. It is their duty to represent their constituency, their party and the interests of the country. It is a tenet of representative democracy that MPs are not delegates for their constituents. This means that their decisions and actions are ultimately governed by putting the best interests of all their constituency before all else. There is a distinct possibility, some would say a likelihood now, that in just 67 days May is going to allow the will of a tiny minority in her party to prevail and, without reference to anyone, set in place a no-deal Brexit. It will be her decision alone, and what a horrifying epitaph it will make. So as we approach the current legally binding exit day of 29 March, let\u2019s be clear what no deal means. There is a raft of some 800 pieces of legislation that needs to be passed to ensure leaving with no deal is legally executed. Some commentators say this is impossible in the time left. This is not strictly true as under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act, passed by MPs, May and her ministers have wide-ranging powers to amend the statute book \u2013 the so-called \u201cHenry VIII powers\u201d. However, such a vast delegation of powers does entail constitutional risks \u2013 especially as they are predicated on the fact a deal has passed through parliament. The legislation appears silent on what happens if there is no deal, thus leading to constitutional and legal chaos. There would be no transitional period. We would face immediate WTO tariffs, and border checks for customs and agricultural products. It is also important to remember the WTO works on consensus of its members \u2013 and there are 164 members and 23 observer governments. So if you think getting 27 countries to agree is tricky, think about this. But the biggest problem for the UK will be to decide whether to apply EU tariffs to the rest of the world \u2013 effectively keeping agricultural protection \u2013 or no tariffs to anyone. And even if the EU, UK and Ireland do not want to put up a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, WTO members will insist on checks. Moreover, what is extremely worrying is that we would be leaving all the EU institutions and agencies when we do not have replacements in place \u2013 on aviation, energy, medicines, chemicals, banking and the environment. Neither are we prepared on a practical level. The dress rehearsal we saw to prevent lorry congestion in Dover was an expensive shambles and shows the lack of joined-up thinking at the heart of the government. The plan had been for Manston airport to be used as a parking facility for 6,000 lorries, but only 89 \u2013 each driver paid \u00a3550 by the taxpayer \u2013 participated.

I would argue that the vast sums of money May has started to randomly spend in areas where she has suddenly realised there might be a problem show her clear intent.

Or why the EU, at its philosophical core a <a href=\"https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/history_en\" title=\"\">peace project</a>, might feel emboldened to act on behalf of a region that is only relatively recently at peace, and still without true reconciliation.</p> \n<p>That brings us to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/15/what-is-the-brexit-backstop\" title=\"\">backstop</a>, a noun now invariably prefaced with \u201ccontroversial\u201d or even \u201chated\u201d.

The ERG says it, too, is greatly affronted by this, but some people \u2013 particularly people actually from Northern Ireland \u2013 take this claim with large portions of salt. It seems likely that the UK-wide elements of the backstop, keeping the UK in a near-customs union, are what really bothers Brexiteers, rather than the principle of Northern Ireland diverging. But the backstop only covers the whole UK at the British government\u2019s request, an attempt to salve the fears of the DUP. An attempt that has not worked.</p> \n<p>Again, we arrive at the question: where is Northern Ireland? It may be in the UK, but that fact is remarkably easy to forget in London, where most parts of the establishment struggle to locate it in their mental conception of the place they govern. Some see that obliviousness as malign, but if it is, it is sort of understandable.

People\u2019s sleep preference, known as their chronotype, is largely dictated by genes. \u201cOwls\u201d \u2013 whose natural tendency is to stay up late and not wake until 10 or 11am \u2013 experience more social jet lag than \u201clarks\u201d, because they struggle to get enough sleep in the week and sleep in at weekends to catch up. However, an extreme lark pressured into staying up late at weekends by friends will also suffer.</p> <p>As anyone who has experienced normal jetlag will know, one of the most obvious symptoms is trouble sleeping. The body takes a while to adapt to a new time zone \u2013 typically a day for every time zone you cross. Similarly, says Roenneberg: \u201cSocial jetlag and sleep deprivation are practically inseparable.\u201d</p> <p>Chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to many of the same illnesses as social jetlag, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obesity and depression; and has been declared a public health epidemic by the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/the-value-of-the-sleep-economy.html\" title=\"\">study</a> by the Rand Corporation calculated that inadequate sleep costs the UK \u00a350bn a year \u2013 equivalent to 1.9% of GDP \u2013 due to decreased productivity and sickness. Sleep deprivation also takes its toll on our daily lives, affecting our vigilance, hand-eye coordination, memory, logical reasoning and emotional stability.</p> <p>However, social jetlag doesn\u2019t only disrupt the amount of sleep. A study of undergraduates found that those who kept irregular bedtimes had poorer quality sleep than those with more consistent sleep schedules, even though they got roughly the same amount overall. Irregular sleep was also associated with poorer academic performance. Andrew Phillips, now at Monash University in Melbourne, who led the study, says: \u201cThis suggests sleep regularity is very important \u2013 it\u2019s not just about getting the right amount of sleep, for example by sleeping in at weekends.\u201d</p> <p>It has other consequences, too. Inside each of our cells is a molecular clock that governs the timing of almost every physiological process in our bodies. The most obvious of these is when we feel sleepy or alert, but circadian clocks also control when we secrete hormones, the activity of our immune cells, our body temperature, even our mood at different times of day and night.</p> <p>These clocks run on roughly (though not precisely) 24-hour schedules \u2013 larks tend to have slightly faster clocks, and owls slightly slower ones \u2013 synchronising through signals from a tiny patch of brain tissue known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which acts as a kind of internal Greenwich Meridian. It knows the time through its interactions with light-responsive cells at the back of the eye, which evolved to register the rising and setting of the sun.</p> <p>If you change the timing of your light exposure \u2013 as you do when you go to bed and wake earlier on weekdays, or when you fly across time zones \u2013 the timing of the clocks in your organs and tissues also shift, although at different rates. If you constantly shift the timing of your sleep and light exposure, as you might if you regularly sleep in at weekends, your clocks will be perpetually out of synchrony.</p> <p>\u201cAlmost all the hormones in your body are on some sort of circadian rhythm and when you are shifting your sleep time, the entire system is not going to be working as efficiently as it should,\u201d says Sierra Forbush, a research assistant at the University of Arizona College of Medicine. She recently presented data from a study of 984 adults that suggested that, for every hour of social jetlag a person experienced each week, there was an 11% increase in their likelihood of having cardiovascular disease. Social jetlag was also associated with worse mood and greater levels of sleepiness and fatigue.</p> <p>Another study found that adults with higher levels of social jetlag were more likely to be overweight or obese and have metabolic syndrome (which is associated with the development of type 2 diabetes) compared with those with more regular sleep patterns \u2013 even after controlling for how much sleep they got.</p> <p>\u201cWe found that just one hour of social jetlag led to the accumulation of about two additional kilograms of fat mass, on average, by the age of 39,\u201d says Michael Parsons, a circadian biology researcher at the Medical Research Council\u2019s Harwell Institute in Oxfordshire, who led the study. \u201cAlthough you often see this increase in fat and body mass index in shift workers, we were surprised that a relatively small amount of social jetlag \u2013 equivalent to flying across one time zone each week \u2013 could be associated with a relatively large increase in such things.\u201d</p> <p>He cautions that factors such as eating too much and not getting enough exercise play a greater role in weight gain. However, he says: \u201cAs a society, it\u2019s something we need to consider when deciding whether or not we should keep such things as daylight savings time [another source of social jetlag] or introduce more flexible working hours to better fit with people\u2019s chronotype.\u201d</p> <p>Which leads us to the question of what to do about it. It is unlikely that the occasional lie-in will be detrimental to your health \u2013 indeed, if it is the only way of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/23/weekend-lie-ins-could-help-you-avoid-an-early-death-study-says\" title=\"\">catching up on sleep</a> you have missed during the week, it is probably a good idea. \u201cIf you have accrued a sleep debt, it needs to be paid back,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cHowever, a much healthier alternative is to try to maintain a regular sleep pattern throughout the week and get more sleep each day.\u201d</p> <p>One way of achieving this would be to allow greater flexibility in people\u2019s working hours, so that owls could start work later and therefore get the recommended seven to eight hours of sleep each night. If he were an employer, Roenneberg says, he would ban the use of alarm clocks and instruct employees to start work only once they had had adequate sleep. \u201cThe majority of employees would still be in the office by 10am or 11am, but this would increase productivity, sick days would go down, and I would get your best time as an employer,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win situation.\u201d</p> <p>However, there may be a simpler solution: light. Although people\u2019s chronotype is genetically determined, environment also influences sleep timing. Studies have shown that when people are sent camping \u2013 removing them from the influence of artificial light and exposing them to more daylight \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/02/having-trouble-sleeping-grab-a-tent-and-go-camping-suggest-researchers\" title=\"\">they become more lark-like</a> and fall asleep about two hours earlier. Inspired by these studies, Phillips used a mathematical model of human sleep and circadian physiology to probe why this should be. He found that, regardless of whether they were exposed to natural or modern lighting conditions (where people spend most of the daytime indoors and their evenings exposed to artificial light), people with longer molecular clocks went to sleep later. However, in the modern condition, variation in the timing of people\u2019s sleep more than doubled because exposure to bright (or blue-enriched) light at night pushes the timing of the SCN, the brain\u2019s master clock, later \u2013 meaning a night-owl\u2019s natural tendency to stay up later is amplified. \u201cWe found that these large inter-individual differences in sleep timing only manifest themselves in the presence of electric light,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cThis is what\u2019s causing a lot of individuals to become very delayed in their sleep timing and hence experience social jetlag.\u201d</p> <p>He suggests turning off overhead lights two hours before bed, and switching to dimmer table lamps. And if you do use a computer or smartphone in the evening, install an app that automatically dims the screen and filters out the blue light.</p> <p>We evolved on a planet where day was day, and night was night. For the sake of our health, it is time to reacquaint ourselves with those extremes.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Linda Geddes\u2019s book </em><em>Chasing the Sun: The new science of sunlight and how it shapes our minds and bodies</em><em> is published by Wellcome Collection</em></p>",

We evolved on a planet where day was day, and night was night. For the sake of our health, it is time to reacquaint ourselves with those extremes. \u2022 Linda Geddes\u2019s book Chasing the Sun: The new science of sunlight and how it shapes our minds and bodies is published by Wellcome Collection",

      "body": "<p>For a song with no lyrics, Rumble managed to say a lot about sex, swagger and the allure of teenage rebellion. Released in 1958 by Native American guitarist Link Wray, the track \u2013 all dirty chord progressions and blistering guitar \u2013 was an omen of the impending 60s rock revolution, and is widely credited with inventing the power chord that would become essential to rock, metal, thrash and other tangential genres. Sixty-one years after its release, Rumble remains the only instrumental track to be banned from American radio, for fear it would incite youth violence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/18/aj-lambert-how-frank-sinatras-grandaughter-does-it-her-way\">AJ Lambert: how Frank Sinatra's granddaughter does it her way</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But this wordless call to arms did get through to the masses, and certain members of the audience to which it spoke would internalize Rumble\u2019s sound and spirit and with them create a new and fantastically unholy genre of larger than life guitar music.</p> <p>\u201cJeff Beck told me that he and Jimmy Page used to jump around the bedroom at his mom\u2019s house playing air guitar to Link Wray,\u201d says guitarist Stevie Salas. \u201cTo visualize these guys that are like, the Mount Rushmore of rock stars playing air guitar to a Shawnee Indian, it just blew my mind.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, Link Wray, the leather-clad rocker prowling the stage with mega-bravado, grew up poor in rural South Carolina in the days when the Ku Klux Klan would ride by his house in the middle of the night, and when the Klan was just as likely to come after you for being Indian as for being black. He\u2019s one of many Native artists \u2013 Jimi Hendrix, The Band\u2019s Robbie Robertson, jazz vocal icon Mildred Bailey \u2013 whose heritage was largely hidden, even as they shaped musical history.</p> <p>Wray\u2019s most famous song thus serves as the title of Rumble: The Indians Who Rocked the World, a documentary exploring the Native American presence in, and influence on, popular music. Released last year, Rumble makes its US television premiere on 21 January and in it, Steve Van Zandt calls Rumble \u201cthe soundtrack to juvenile delinquency\u201d while Iggy Pop preaches that the track \u201c did help me say \u2018fuck it, I\u2019m gonna be a musician.\u2019\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hovJUoyxulc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hovJUoyxulc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But Rumble\u2019s narrative goes far deeper than teenage impulses, tracing a path from rock \u2018n\u2019 roll to jazz to the blues to the music of pre-colonial America, before European immigrants and Federal government began their systematic decimation of Native people and the vibrant musical traditions they carried. Through exhaustive research backed by the Smithsonian, Rumble makes a case that the blues, the oldest form of American popular music, was influenced by even more ancient Native styles of playing and singing.</p> <p>In particular the film points to Charley Patton \u2013 \u201cthe father of the Delta blues\u201d who\u2019s believed to have Choctaw ancestry \u2013 as a key artist who melded traditional tribal rhythms with the then burgeoning blues. The scene in which Tuscarora/Ta\u00edno musician Pura F\u00e9 demonstrates the Native influence in Patton\u2019s Down the Red Dirt Road will likely give you chills.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s Indian music with a guitar,\u201d F\u00e9 says, her eyes lighting up, \u201cthat\u2019s where it went.\u201d</p> <p>Patton\u2019s style influenced other blues artists and, eventually, the British rock and rollers like The Rolling Stones, The Who and Zeppelin who would bow at their feet in the \u201860s. Rumble features a 1965 clip from the American musical variety show Shindig! in which the Stones host a performance by Howlin\u2019 Wolf, who was deeply influenced by Patton. With such footage, Rumble fleshes out the DNA of popular music, which has for centuries been incomplete due to the suppression of Native people.</p> <p>\u201cAs we started to find out the depth of it, we were so excited and also felt a tremendous amount of responsibility to do it properly,\u201d says Rumble\u2019s director Catherine Bainbridge. \u201cIt\u2019s a nuanced thing, and it\u2019s not about over-claiming anything. It\u2019s just about saying there\u2019s a part of that history that got buried, and that you should know because it was important.\u201d</p> <p>Rumble took four years to make and was filmed in 28 cities throughout North America \u2013 from the deep south to the mountainous west \u2013 with the film-makers often spending days with families of the musicians they were investigating, gathering stories and digging through old photo albums.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d4fcb1e9c9e107fb18ae00c5723ea93e9995423\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d4fcb1e9c9e107fb18ae00c5723ea93e9995423/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steven Van Zandt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steven Van Zandt</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pedro Ruiz/Rezolution Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ultimately, they gathered over 10,000 pieces of archival materials and did 178 hours worth of interviews with musicologists, historians, journalists, poets and rockstars. Rumble\u2019s cast features Pop, Van Zandt, George Clinton, Martin Scorsese, Steven Tyler, Dan Auerbach, Taj Mahal, Jackson Browne, Slash, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Robbie Robertson, Metallica\u2019s Robert Trujillo, Wayne Kramer of the MC5, Taboo of the Black Eyed Peas and other musical luminaries talking about each artist in question with unmistakable deference.</p> <p>\u201cI was completely influenced by Mildred Bailey,\u201d Tony Bennett gushes. \u201cShe sang perfect, for me.\u201d</p> <p>The A-list cast was largely a function of the film\u2019s executive producer Stevie Salas, a venerable rock guitarist who\u2019s toured with Rod Stewart and The Rolling Stones. Salas and Bainbridge felt it was key to have famous musicians proclaiming the importance of Native artists in order to make the case for their importance and add weight to interviews with subjects including F\u00e8 and the late Santee Dakota author, musician and activist John Trudell.</p> <p>\u201cTo me it was important that it wasn\u2019t just Native people praising these musicians, but the biggest rockstars in the world,\u201d Salas says. \u201cIf I got on screen and said, \u2018Jesse Ed Davis was the greatest guitar player,\u2019 you\u2019d say, \u2018Okay, whatever.\u2019 If Eric Clapton tells you, you\u2019re a lot more inclined to believe him.\u201d Salas\u2019 rock Rolodex also helped open doors when requesting interviews.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone,\u201d says Bainbridge, \u201csaid yes without hesitation\u201d.</p> <p>The idea for Rumble came to Salas after he worked he worked with co-Executive Producer Tim Johnson at the Smithsonian Museum of the American Indian on Up Where We Belong: Native Musicians In Popular Culture. Based on Brian Wright-McLeod\u2019s 2000 book The Encyclopedia of Native Music, this 2010 exhibition displayed artifacts from Native musicians including Jimi Hendrix, Robertson and Sainte-Marie, and hosted record crowds in Washington D.C. and New York. In this era, Salas was spending time on reservations and had witnessed he says, \u201cwhat seemed to be a lack of role models. People to look up to Native Americans from 100 or 200 years ago, the Sitting Bulls and Geronimos. I wanted to do something to show Native American people that Native American musicians were really influential and fantastic.\u201d He decided to make the exhibit into a movie.</p> <p>Collaborating with Bainbridge was an easy fit, as the Canadian director had made the 2009 film Reel Injun, which documented Hollywood\u2019s portrayals, and misportrayals, of Native people. What the filmmakers and their team found as they researched was, to them, nothing less than a revision of history, so much so that a curriculum has been developed around Rumble so it can be taught in schools. Meanwhile, last year Rumble found wide release in hundreds of theaters throughout North American and Europe. (Of using the controversial label \u201cIndian\u201d in the title, Salas says: \u201cThe goal was to get as many people to understand what the film is, so they\u2019d see it and learn the information. If that meant using a word people are more familiar with, the end justified the means.\u201d)</p> <p>In 2017, Rumble<em> </em>was named one of the year\u2019s best Canadian films at the Toronto film festival and won the world cinema documentary special jury award for masterful storytelling at the Sundance film festival. Salas couldn\u2019t attend Sundance, as he was on tour in Japan recouping some of the money he lost while taking time off the road to make the movie. Meanwhile Bainbridge and her husband, who is First Nation, had mortgaged their house to help finance the film.</p> <p>For the duo, the steep investment of time and money has paying off not only in praise, but more so in the opportunity to shine a light on Native American heroes who, until now, have been largely left out of the mainstream.</p> <p>\u201cWhat makes me so proud about the film,\u201d Bainbridge says, \u201cis that now all of us can know this history, and once we know that, we know there are other things we don\u2019t know. That\u2019s where we are right now in our history of decolonization\u2014all the stories are being retold.\u201d<br></p>",

Released in 1958 by Native American guitarist Link Wray, the track \u2013 all dirty chord progressions and blistering guitar \u2013 was an omen of the impending 60s rock revolution, and is widely credited with inventing the power chord that would become essential to rock, metal, thrash and other tangential genres. Sixty-one years after its release, Rumble remains the only instrumental track to be banned from American radio, for fear it would incite youth violence. But this wordless call to arms did get through to the masses, and certain members of the audience to which it spoke would internalize Rumble\u2019s sound and spirit and with them create a new and fantastically unholy genre of larger than life guitar music. \u201cJeff Beck told me that he and Jimmy Page used to jump around the bedroom at his mom\u2019s house playing air guitar to Link Wray,\u201d says guitarist Stevie Salas. \u201cTo visualize these guys that are like, the Mount Rushmore of rock stars playing air guitar to a Shawnee Indian, it just blew my mind.\u201d Indeed, Link Wray, the leather-clad rocker prowling the stage with mega-bravado, grew up poor in rural South Carolina in the days when the Ku Klux Klan would ride by his house in the middle of the night, and when the Klan was just as likely to come after you for being Indian as for being black. He\u2019s one of many Native artists \u2013 Jimi Hendrix, The Band\u2019s Robbie Robertson, jazz vocal icon Mildred Bailey \u2013 whose heritage was largely hidden, even as they shaped musical history. Wray\u2019s most famous song thus serves as the title of Rumble: The Indians Who Rocked the World, a documentary exploring the Native American presence in, and influence on, popular music. Released last year, Rumble makes its US television premiere on 21 January and in it, Steve Van Zandt calls Rumble \u201cthe soundtrack to juvenile delinquency\u201d while Iggy Pop preaches that the track \u201c did help me say \u2018fuck it, I\u2019m gonna be a musician.\u2019\u201d But Rumble\u2019s narrative goes far deeper than teenage impulses, tracing a path from rock \u2018n\u2019 roll to jazz to the blues to the music of pre-colonial America, before European immigrants and Federal government began their systematic decimation of Native people and the vibrant musical traditions they carried. Through exhaustive research backed by the Smithsonian, Rumble makes a case that the blues, the oldest form of American popular music, was influenced by even more ancient Native styles of playing and singing. In particular the film points to Charley Patton \u2013 \u201cthe father of the Delta blues\u201d who\u2019s believed to have Choctaw ancestry \u2013 as a key artist who melded traditional tribal rhythms with the then burgeoning blues. The scene in which Tuscarora/Ta\u00edno musician Pura F\u00e9 demonstrates the Native influence in Patton\u2019s Down the Red Dirt Road will likely give you chills. \u201cThat\u2019s Indian music with a guitar,\u201d F\u00e9 says, her eyes lighting up, \u201cthat\u2019s where it went.\u201d Patton\u2019s style influenced other blues artists and, eventually, the British rock and rollers like The Rolling Stones, The Who and Zeppelin who would bow at their feet in the \u201860s. Rumble features a 1965 clip from the American musical variety show Shindig! in which the Stones host a performance by Howlin\u2019 Wolf, who was deeply influenced by Patton. With such footage, Rumble fleshes out the DNA of popular music, which has for centuries been incomplete due to the suppression of Native people. \u201cAs we started to find out the depth of it, we were so excited and also felt a tremendous amount of responsibility to do it properly,\u201d says Rumble\u2019s director Catherine Bainbridge. \u201cIt\u2019s a nuanced thing, and it\u2019s not about over-claiming anything. It\u2019s just about saying there\u2019s a part of that history that got buried, and that you should know because it was important.\u201d Rumble took four years to make and was filmed in 28 cities throughout North America \u2013 from the deep south to the mountainous west \u2013 with the film-makers often spending days with families of the musicians they were investigating, gathering stories and digging through old photo albums. Ultimately, they gathered over 10,000 pieces of archival materials and did 178 hours worth of interviews with musicologists, historians, journalists, poets and rockstars. Rumble\u2019s cast features Pop, Van Zandt, George Clinton, Martin Scorsese, Steven Tyler, Dan Auerbach, Taj Mahal, Jackson Browne, Slash, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Robbie Robertson, Metallica\u2019s Robert Trujillo, Wayne Kramer of the MC5, Taboo of the Black Eyed Peas and other musical luminaries talking about each artist in question with unmistakable deference. \u201cI was completely influenced by Mildred Bailey,\u201d Tony Bennett gushes. \u201cShe sang perfect, for me.\u201d The A-list cast was largely a function of the film\u2019s executive producer Stevie Salas, a venerable rock guitarist who\u2019s toured with Rod Stewart and The Rolling Stones. Salas and Bainbridge felt it was key to have famous musicians proclaiming the importance of Native artists in order to make the case for their importance and add weight to interviews with subjects including F\u00e8 and the late Santee Dakota author, musician and activist John Trudell. \u201cTo me it was important that it wasn\u2019t just Native people praising these musicians, but the biggest rockstars in the world,\u201d Salas says. \u201cIf I got on screen and said, \u2018Jesse Ed Davis was the greatest guitar player,\u2019 you\u2019d say, \u2018Okay, whatever.\u2019 If Eric Clapton tells you, you\u2019re a lot more inclined to believe him.\u201d Salas\u2019 rock Rolodex also helped open doors when requesting interviews. \u201cEveryone,\u201d says Bainbridge, \u201csaid yes without hesitation\u201d. The idea for Rumble came to Salas after he worked he worked with co-Executive Producer Tim Johnson at the Smithsonian Museum of the American Indian on Up Where We Belong: Native Musicians In Popular Culture. Based on Brian Wright-McLeod\u2019s 2000 book The Encyclopedia of Native Music, this 2010 exhibition displayed artifacts from Native musicians including Jimi Hendrix, Robertson and Sainte-Marie, and hosted record crowds in Washington D.C. and New York. In this era, Salas was spending time on reservations and had witnessed he says, \u201cwhat seemed to be a lack of role models. People to look up to Native Americans from 100 or 200 years ago, the Sitting Bulls and Geronimos. I wanted to do something to show Native American people that Native American musicians were really influential and fantastic.\u201d He decided to make the exhibit into a movie. Collaborating with Bainbridge was an easy fit, as the Canadian director had made the 2009 film Reel Injun, which documented Hollywood\u2019s portrayals, and misportrayals, of Native people. What the filmmakers and their team found as they researched was, to them, nothing less than a revision of history, so much so that a curriculum has been developed around Rumble so it can be taught in schools. Meanwhile, last year Rumble found wide release in hundreds of theaters throughout North American and Europe. (Of using the controversial label \u201cIndian\u201d in the title, Salas says: \u201cThe goal was to get as many people to understand what the film is, so they\u2019d see it and learn the information. If that meant using a word people are more familiar with, the end justified the means.\u201d) In 2017, Rumble was named one of the year\u2019s best Canadian films at the Toronto film festival and won the world cinema documentary special jury award for masterful storytelling at the Sundance film festival. Salas couldn\u2019t attend Sundance, as he was on tour in Japan recouping some of the money he lost while taking time off the road to make the movie. Meanwhile Bainbridge and her husband, who is First Nation, had mortgaged their house to help finance the film. For the duo, the steep investment of time and money has paying off not only in praise, but more so in the opportunity to shine a light on Native American heroes who, until now, have been largely left out of the mainstream. \u201cWhat makes me so proud about the film,\u201d Bainbridge says, \u201cis that now all of us can know this history, and once we know that, we know there are other things we don\u2019t know. That\u2019s where we are right now in our history of decolonization\u2014all the stories are being retold.\u201d",

The Spaniard has had to muddle along with an imbalanced squad but has shown he can make important tactical interventions on several occasions. He certainly got the better of Maurizio Sarri, disrupting the Chelsea manager\u2019s attempts to build from the back by using an energetic high press, and his switch to a midfield diamond demonstrated Arsenal have become more flexible since parting company with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. Emery\u2019s side played with snap and bite from the start, with the tone set by Lucas Torreira\u2019s waspish performance, and the impressive Aaron Ramsey. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/19/arsenal-alexandre-lacazette-chelsea\">Lacazette shows Chelsea the value of a no-nonsense No 9</a></p></li> </ul> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/20/chelsea-maurizio-sarri-mess-tactics-transfer-policy\">Chelsea have a good manager and players \u2013 so why are they in a mess? | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>2) Salah\u2019s theatrics take shine off his latest feat</h2> <p>\u201cExceptional achievement from a world-class player,\u201d was J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s verdict on Mohamed Salah reaching the milestone of 50 Premier League goals. The Egypt international hit the half-century in 72 games. Only out-and-out strikers Ruud van Nistelrooy, Alan Shearer and Andy Cole got there in fewer games. \u201cMaybe he would have scored more and earlier if I hadn\u2019t played him on the right wing so often,\u201d Klopp added. \u201cMy fault.\u201d The forward\u2019s anticipation, awareness and improvisation earned the reward but rather less appetising was his theatrical attempt to win a first-half penalty under pressure from Mamadou Sakho. Salah was affronted by Luka Milivojevic\u2019s angry reaction to the tumble but didn\u2019t have a leg to stand on. Theoretically and literally. The slight on Salah\u2019s reputation was self-inflicted. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/19/liverpool-had-to-dig-in-against-crystal-palace-jurgen-klopp\">\u2018Liverpool had to dig deep,\u2019 says relieved Klopp after thrilling win</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cb0e43991d324dd6ace38dc9c78f0b7a827262f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cb0e43991d324dd6ace38dc9c78f0b7a827262f/0_827_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luka Milivojevic confronts Mohamed Salah of Liverpool after he goes down.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luka Milivojevic confronts Mohamed Salah of Liverpool after he goes down.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Greenwood/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3) Mahrez\u2019s omission a sign of City\u2019s strength</h2> <p>\u201cTactical\u201d was the explanation from Pep Guardiola when he was asked about Riyad Mahrez, Manchester City\u2019s record signing, not even warranting a place among their substitutes for the 3-0 win at Huddersfield Town. Others might see it as perplexing that the \u00a360m man has drifted out of the squad and was an unused substitute in their previous two Premier League games against Wolves or Liverpool.

That their defending is hapless is one of the 2018-19 season\u2019s leading statements of the bleeding obvious. It was in painful evidence during one of their most organised displays since being promoted and what should have been one of their better results; this was the squandering of a golden chance to take points off a tired, diminished Tottenham. Tim Ream\u2019s disorientated swinging at fresh air created the chance for Dele Alli to equalise just as it seemed a frustrated visiting side could be kept at bay and then Joe Bryan lost Harry Winks for the injury-time winner. As someone who honed his managerial art in the Serie A of the 1990s, Claudio Ranieri\u2019s instinct is to sit back on leads but he does not have the players for that to be viable at Fulham. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/20/spurs-injury-woe-dele-alli-hamstring-tottenham-harry-kane\">Pochettino says Alli\u2019s hamstring injury does \u2018not look great\u2019</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f68e3644ea3bd20642aef0f0925270df0fc88328\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f68e3644ea3bd20642aef0f0925270df0fc88328/72_141_2557_1534/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fulham are crestfallen after Harry Winks\u2019 injury-time winner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fulham are crestfallen after Harry Winks\u2019 injury-time winner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Stephen/ProSports/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5) Jota emerges from the shadows in style</h2> <p>Diogo Jota became the first Wolves player to score a top-flight hat-trick since John Richards in 1977 but it was his all-round game, bouncing off Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, that brought his rewards against Leicester. Jota is perhaps the most unheralded of the club\u2019s sizeable Portuguese contingent, operating in the shadows of midfield pair R\u00faben Neves and Jo\u00e3o Moutinho but he undoubtedly plays a key role in helping Wolves tick. After enjoying a prolific debut season in England, Jota had, until now, struggled to replicate that form but there is evidence there is plenty more to come from the talented forward, who turned 22 in December. \u201cPre-season was not the best for many reasons,\u201d Jota said. \u201cI was struggling to feel good on the pitch and [did not] feel fast and quick.

Marco Silva\u2019s side have come under heavy scrutiny following a summer of investment, which has failed to provide a stable defence or regular goals. This defeat means they have won back-to-back Premier League games once this season. A battling win over Bournemouth will have given fans hope but losing to Southampton again proved their inability to put together two good performances consecutively. Failing to recover from going behind does not help; James Ward-Prowse\u2019s opener was the 10th time this season Everton have conceded first and they have only procured two points from those games, a sign of their inability to fight back, a problem management rather than money will need to resolve soon. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/19/southampton-everton-premier-league-match-report\">Ward-Prowse hits stunner to seal win for Saints</a><br></p></li> </ul> <h2>8) Sch\u00e4r shines as Ashley looks on</h2> <p>The last time Newcastle had beaten Cardiff 3-0 on Tyneside in the Premier League, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side were relegated and the home manager, Alan Pardew, was subjected to such sustained abuse from fans he remained, cowering, in his dug-out throughout.

      "bodyText": "1) Emery\u2019s tactical flexibility aids diamond display While these have been a troubled few weeks for Arsenal, with Sven Mislintat\u2019s impending exit set to leave a big hole in their recruitment department, their victory over Chelsea was a reminder there have been plenty of positives during Unai Emery\u2019s first season. The Spaniard has had to muddle along with an imbalanced squad but has shown he can make important tactical interventions on several occasions. He certainly got the better of Maurizio Sarri, disrupting the Chelsea manager\u2019s attempts to build from the back by using an energetic high press, and his switch to a midfield diamond demonstrated Arsenal have become more flexible since parting company with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. Emery\u2019s side played with snap and bite from the start, with the tone set by Lucas Torreira\u2019s waspish performance, and the impressive Aaron Ramsey. Jacob Steinberg Lacazette shows Chelsea the value of a no-nonsense No 9 2) Salah\u2019s theatrics take shine off his latest feat \u201cExceptional achievement from a world-class player,\u201d was J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s verdict on Mohamed Salah reaching the milestone of 50 Premier League goals. The Egypt international hit the half-century in 72 games. Only out-and-out strikers Ruud van Nistelrooy, Alan Shearer and Andy Cole got there in fewer games. \u201cMaybe he would have scored more and earlier if I hadn\u2019t played him on the right wing so often,\u201d Klopp added. \u201cMy fault.\u201d The forward\u2019s anticipation, awareness and improvisation earned the reward but rather less appetising was his theatrical attempt to win a first-half penalty under pressure from Mamadou Sakho. Salah was affronted by Luka Milivojevic\u2019s angry reaction to the tumble but didn\u2019t have a leg to stand on. Theoretically and literally. The slight on Salah\u2019s reputation was self-inflicted. Andy Hunter \u2018Liverpool had to dig deep,\u2019 says relieved Klopp after thrilling win 3) Mahrez\u2019s omission a sign of City\u2019s strength \u201cTactical\u201d was the explanation from Pep Guardiola when he was asked about Riyad Mahrez, Manchester City\u2019s record signing, not even warranting a place among their substitutes for the 3-0 win at Huddersfield Town. Others might see it as perplexing that the \u00a360m man has drifted out of the squad and was an unused substitute in their previous two Premier League games against Wolves or Liverpool. For Mahrez, who was bought from Leicester, it must clearly be a worry. More than anything, however, it is probably a reminder of City\u2019s immense resources rather than anything the player has particularly done wrong. And there can be no guarantees, with Kevin De Bruyne fit again, Leroy San\u00e9 and Raheem Sterling excelling on the wings and the two Silvas, David and Bernardo, also to factor in, that it was only a one-off. Daniel Taylor Guardiola says City must improve to win the league 4) Fulham undone by hapless defending yet again Fulham scored first for the third match in succession but all three of those games ended in defeat. That their defending is hapless is one of the 2018-19 season\u2019s leading statements of the bleeding obvious.

As someone who honed his managerial art in the Serie A of the 1990s, Claudio Ranieri\u2019s instinct is to sit back on leads but he does not have the players for that to be viable at Fulham. John Brewin Pochettino says Alli\u2019s hamstring injury does \u2018not look great\u2019 5) Jota emerges from the shadows in style Diogo Jota became the first Wolves player to score a top-flight hat-trick since John Richards in 1977 but it was his all-round game, bouncing off Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, that brought his rewards against Leicester.

The art deco and modernist buildings of the early 20th century fell into decline during the Vietnam war, but the area has undergone a revival of late with stores by Gucci, Dior and Louis Vuitton.</p> \n<p>Destruction, however, is never far away. The once-prestigious art deco apartment building at 213 Dong Khoi (mentioned in Graham Greene\u2019s The Quiet American) was demolished for a new government office. One block west, the 1924 Charner department store (latterly the Tax Trade Centre) was knocked down to make way for the city\u2019s <a href=\"https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/saigon-s-first-metro-line-will-not-open-on-schedule-3826100.html\">long-delayed metro</a>. Assurances were given that its grand Moroccan-style staircase and intricate tiles were to be removed and preserved, but heritage groups believe them to have been destroyed.</p> \n<p>Next door to the 19th-century Hotel Continental, where Greene used to drink and write, the six-storey Eden Building (used as a media centre during the Vietnam war) featured the distinctive curved corner style particular to modernist buildings along Dong Khoi, and housed a colonial-era cinema and arcade \u2013 until it was demolished in 2009 for a Vincom shopping mall. Only one art deco apartment block survives on Dong Khoi, currently inhabited by a warren of small retailers and workshops, its shaky old elevator caked in dust. It, too, is slated for demolition.</p> \n<p>The city\u2019s modernist heritage may be next, says the architectural historian Mel Schenck. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"55d863d0480b8c20c95cb00f1f859b519f1306b8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55d863d0480b8c20c95cb00f1f859b519f1306b8/0_405_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Ho Chi Minh City skyline from an apartment in the Golden River complex.

Photograph: Tan Le/Getty</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Schenck estimates that 70-80% of the city is built in modernist style, much of it by noted Vietnamese architects such as Ngo Viet Thu, who designed the Independence Palace. If you pick a classic \u201cshophouse\u201d street at random and look up, the majority of the top floors are modernist. \u201cThere is so much of it that it\u2019s become ordinary and people don\u2019t even think about it,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I see awnings and junk around a house, that\u2019s good, because that means the building is being well used and isn\u2019t in as much danger of being demolished. If the house is cleaned up, it\u2019s not a good sign.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even being designed by Ngo Viet Thu himself is no protection. A villa of his in District 3 is currently vacant apart from a live-in caretaker. \u201cIt\u2019s on a hot street,\u201d says Schenck. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of land. It\u2019s going to go.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ngo Viet Thu\u2019s son, Ngo Viet Nam Son, is also an architect, and lives and works between Ho Chi Minh City, the US and Canada. He believes his hometown must learn from the mistakes made by other fast-growing Asian cities before it is too late.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not the only city to experience this growth, and we should learn from these experiences,\u201d he says. \u201cBut this city hasn\u2019t taken that lesson yet. In Ba Son, they could have made a very nice area, a cultural and green space for the city \u2013 something like Pier 59 in New York, or Fisherman\u2019s Wharf in San Francisco \u2013 but instead they destroyed it.</p> \n<p>\u201cDevelopers don\u2019t realise that when they destroy historic buildings they are losing a potential economic gain, and if you consider tourism, then people want to see the old city to get a sense of place. Preservation can contribute to economic value.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38b697ba1611ee907bc4a291ff9f087d1a8893e5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38b697ba1611ee907bc4a291ff9f087d1a8893e5/0_0_4908_3251/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Critics say the historic centre of Ho Chi Minh City is increasingly being filled with generic architecture which could be anywhere in Asia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Critics say the historic centre of Ho Chi Minh City is increasingly being filled with generic architecture which could be anywhere in Asia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: laranik/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"2c973298662d5d75eebd9e0381864cfe800cf52d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c973298662d5d75eebd9e0381864cfe800cf52d/0_0_3974_3974/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sea of mopeds in central Ho Chi Minh City\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sea of mopeds in central Ho Chi Minh City</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rwp Uk/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"de56de6ba36a911c8db187b78022a11c71b443a5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de56de6ba36a911c8db187b78022a11c71b443a5/0_954_2848_2848/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Much of Ho Chi Minh City is still made up of traditional \u2018shophouses\u2019: shops or restaurants on the ground floor, and living accommodation for three to five storeys above\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Much of Ho Chi Minh City is still made up of traditional \u2018shophouses\u2019: shops or restaurants on the ground floor, and living accommodation for three to five storeys above</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ngoc Nguyen Quang/Getty Images/EyeEm</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Critics say the historic centre is increasingly filled with generic architecture which could be anywhere in Asia.

It is currently the largest development project in the city\u2019s central District 1 neighbourhood, with a cluster of partly constructed 50-storey apartment blocks jutting above the fence. Volunteers for the Saigon Heritage Observatory, such as Nguyen, have not been allowed in since building work began. All believe the shipyard \u2013 founded in the 18th century by Gia Long, who would go on to become emperor \u2013 and its unique industrial architecture have been completely destroyed. Renders for what will replace it show rows of upmarket townhouses between the tall glass and steel towers, as well as a yachting marina on the Saigon River: luxury living for the few. \u201cIt used to be so beautiful,\u201d says Nguyen as we walk the Ba Son perimeter, a constant stream of scooters flowing around us. \u201cI cried when I first heard we had lost the trees. My mother used to take me this way to school and the trees used to give shade and oxygen. People used to collect tamarind and sell it \u2026 until last year when they cut the trees down.\u201d Ho Chi Minh City (known as Saigon until reunification in 1976) has long had a reputation for being international and cosmopolitan \u2013 particularly compared with the one-party state\u2019s political capital, Hanoi, in the north. As the economic capital of communist Vietnam it has always been the place to make money, but with a population of 8.1 million \u2013 set to rise above 10 million by 2026, according to the latest UN estimates \u2013 the pace of change in this dynamic city has accelerated.

The People\u2019s Committee, which runs the city, is currently dividing around 1,000 historic buildings into three classifications: class 1, which is protected; class 2, where the owner can build on the lot but cannot destroy the old building; and class 3, which can be demolished. \u201cIt is sad, but the owners of class 3 are seen as the winners,\u201d says the planner. \u201cGenerally they are after immediate profit and people want modernity, cleanliness, air-conditioning \u2026 they\u2019re not interested in preserving old tiles. They see that the owner next door demolished to build a 32-storey office with restaurant and luxury flats and they think, why can\u2019t I?\u201d Before and after: Another historic building bites the dust (left) and the park and building destroyed to make way for the Vincom Center (right). Photographs: Historic Vietnam A stroll down the elegant Dong Khoi street illustrates the scale of change. The art deco and modernist buildings of the early 20th century fell into decline during the Vietnam war, but the area has undergone a revival of late with stores by Gucci, Dior and Louis Vuitton. Destruction, however, is never far away. The once-prestigious art deco apartment building at 213 Dong Khoi (mentioned in Graham Greene\u2019s The Quiet American) was demolished for a new government office. One block west, the 1924 Charner department store (latterly the Tax Trade Centre) was knocked down to make way for the city\u2019s long-delayed metro. Assurances were given that its grand Moroccan-style staircase and intricate tiles were to be removed and preserved, but heritage groups believe them to have been destroyed. Next door to the 19th-century Hotel Continental, where Greene used to drink and write, the six-storey Eden Building (used as a media centre during the Vietnam war) featured the distinctive curved corner style particular to modernist buildings along Dong Khoi, and housed a colonial-era cinema and arcade \u2013 until it was demolished in 2009 for a Vincom shopping mall. Only one art deco apartment block survives on Dong Khoi, currently inhabited by a warren of small retailers and workshops, its shaky old elevator caked in dust. It, too, is slated for demolition. The city\u2019s modernist heritage may be next, says the architectural historian Mel Schenck. The skyline from an apartment in the Golden River complex. What remains of the historic Ba Son shipyard can be seen at the bottom right of the image. Photograph: Tan Le/Getty Schenck estimates that 70-80% of the city is built in modernist style, much of it by noted Vietnamese architects such as Ngo Viet Thu, who designed the Independence Palace. If you pick a classic \u201cshophouse\u201d street at random and look up, the majority of the top floors are modernist. \u201cThere is so much of it that it\u2019s become ordinary and people don\u2019t even think about it,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I see awnings and junk around a house, that\u2019s good, because that means the building is being well used and isn\u2019t in as much danger of being demolished. If the house is cleaned up, it\u2019s not a good sign.\u201d Even being designed by Ngo Viet Thu himself is no protection. A villa of his in District 3 is currently vacant apart from a live-in caretaker. \u201cIt\u2019s on a hot street,\u201d says Schenck. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of land. It\u2019s going to go.\u201d Ngo Viet Thu\u2019s son, Ngo Viet Nam Son, is also an architect, and lives and works between Ho Chi Minh City, the US and Canada. He believes his hometown must learn from the mistakes made by other fast-growing Asian cities before it is too late. \u201cWe\u2019re not the only city to experience this growth, and we should learn from these experiences,\u201d he says. \u201cBut this city hasn\u2019t taken that lesson yet. In Ba Son, they could have made a very nice area, a cultural and green space for the city \u2013 something like Pier 59 in New York, or Fisherman\u2019s Wharf in San Francisco \u2013 but instead they destroyed it. \u201cDevelopers don\u2019t realise that when they destroy historic buildings they are losing a potential economic gain, and if you consider tourism, then people want to see the old city to get a sense of place. Preservation can contribute to economic value.\u201d Critics say the historic centre is increasingly filled with generic architecture which could be anywhere in Asia. Photographs: laranik/Alamy/Rwp Uk/Getty/Ngoc Nguyen Quang/Getty/EyeEm He looks to Shanghai, which shares similar geography \u2013 a historic centre facing what was mostly vacant land across the river \u2013 and political conditions. There, the historic centre is largely protected, with the Pudong marshland east of the river has been developed as the financial district. \u201cWe should preserve District 1 as our old downtown \u2013 some new building, but the priority should be to preserve,\u201d he says. \u201cThen Thu Thiem in District 2 over the river can be the international financial district.\u201d Instead, Ho Chi Minh City has two separate masterplans, with the one for the historic west foreseeing a wall of skyscrapers marching down the river. The new developments are often built on raised land to protect them from flooding, while ironically blocking rainwater from flowing freely into the river and so causing more floods elsewhere. They also do not provide much in the way of public space. A new green space in the Central Park development, also built on land reclaimed from the river, is watched over by security guards who ask if users are residents. There is a ban on unaccompanied children under 12 and pets, and signs warn people to safeguard \u201cetiquette, order, safety and aesthetics\u201d. Amid all the concrete and glass, there appears to be a belated appreciation of heritage among the city\u2019s younger people. \u201cVintage\u201d cafes are popular, even if they are often located inside modern air-conditioned buildings, as are vintage dresses and fashions. \u201cHeritage is trendy now, but I worry it is just a bubble,\u201d says Nguyen. \u201cIt may be popular for a year but then I don\u2019t know who will be with us after that. \u201cUltimately I am optimistic that more people will learn and become interested and get involved \u2013 but I do feel frustrated that sometimes people just don\u2019t care.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here",

      "body": "<p>T<em>he Matrix</em> has barely started when a phone booth is demolished, left as a smashed pancake of glass and metal. It was a prophetic touch. Payphones were still everywhere in western cities when the film came out in March 1999. By the time of the first sequel four years later, they were already half-vanished, replaced by a private army of Nokias and Motorolas.</p> <p>But now <em>The Matrix</em> is a relic too, a quaint slice of 90s nostalgia about to celebrate its 20th anniversary. \u201c1999\u201d, the recent song from Charli XCX and Troye Sivan, features wistful lyrics (\u201cThose days, it was so much better\u201d) and <a href=\"http://charlixcx.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">cover art</a> in which the millennial pop stars wear the black leather costumes made famous by Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss as they battled the machines enslaving humanity. Yet for a relic, it never slipped far from view \u2013 still a familiar reference in a world divided between internet and IRL (in real life), its characters endlessly circulating in memes and gifs, often as vehicles for the acrid politics that define our 21st century.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bec14a0bced8a300ce598e99c3c44e657a7c7b02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bec14a0bced8a300ce598e99c3c44e657a7c7b02/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charli XCX and Troye Sivan on the cover of \u20181999\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charli XCX and Troye Sivan on the cover of \u20181999\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back in the 20th, much of the highest excitement was reserved for the visuals \u2013 the \u201cdigital rain\u201d of green code, the bullets slowed to a stop while Reeves swayed around them. But the premise was what made it a phenomenon, the idea our whole reality might be a virtual concoction. How would we know? More ticklish still, would we want to? If, like Reeves\u2019s weary hacker Neo, we were approached by Laurence Fishburne\u2019s Morpheus, would we take the blue pill to return us to life as it merely seemed to be? Or the red that promised us \u2013 however terrible \u2013 the real?</p> <p>Of course, Neo chose red, as we told ourselves we would, too. The notion of the matrix hit a nerve. Despite sunlit economies and political stability, a strange ennui and mistrust of technology hung over the end of the 90s. People fretted about the \u201cmillennium bug\u201d and reality TV.</p> <p>In fact, as sibling co-creators the Wachowskis alluded to on screen, the film was just the latest in a long line of variations on a theme, nestled in the mainstream of philosophy. In the allegory of the cave, Plato presented humanity chained to a cave wall, taking passing shadows for reality. Then came the first meditation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/13/my-hero-rene-descartes-kelman\" title=\"\">Descartes</a> (1641), speculating that everything his senses told him might just be the work of an \u201cevil demon\u201d. By the 1980s, we had the theory of the brain in the vat \u2013 built on the impossibility of ever knowing for sure that you aren\u2019t exactly that, your whole life simply electrical impulses wired into your tank.</p> <p>For the philosophers of 1999, <em>The Matrix</em> meant boom time. High-profile essay collections found existentialists, nihilists, Christian theologians, Zen Buddhists and a dozen other schools of thought throwing metaphysical buns at each other over the meaning of the movie. For a time, the shriek and whirr of your dial-up modem could take you \u2013 eventually \u2013 to the official <em>Matrix</em> website, where densely argued academic papers were hosted on the corporate dime of Warner Bros.</p> <p>But the mind to which the Wachowskis paid their deepest tribute was unimpressed. During the film, Neo pulls from a shelf a hardback, <em>Simulacra and Simulation</em>, by academic and provocateur Jean Baudrillard. While the pages were hollowed out to hold an illicit cache of computer disks, Reeves had been required by the Wachowskis to read the book, to better acquaint himself with the film\u2019s most treasured influence.</p> <p>A postmodernist darling, Baudrillard put forth a slippery but naggingly brilliant idea \u2013 that reality itself had been replaced with endless reproductions of what simply felt like it. Jobs, novels, architecture, ideologies, wars: they were all just copies and copies of copies of long gone originals. Take <em>The Matrix</em> \u2013 living on in those gifs, pop songs and this piece in the Guardian, but actually watched with vanishing rarity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To \u2018redpill\u2019 is now a verb, opening the eyes of far-right recruits to hated oppressors \u2013 feminists and people of colour</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Baudrillard called it \u201cthe desert of the real\u201d. The Wachowskis had Morpheus intone the phrase from a Chesterfield armchair set in the smoking ruins of our former civilisation. But the film only moved Baudrillard to protest that it was a misrepresentation. For him, \u201chypercapitalism\u201d had destroyed the very idea of reality \u2013 whereas <em>The Matrix</em> had a whole new one ready to go as soon as Neo could overthrow the machines.</p> <p>The theory of the brain in a vat contained a fiendish double bluff \u2013 from within your tank, you might even be prompted to wonder if you were just a floating brain. To Baudrillard, hypercapitalism was similarly deceptive, knowingly producing spectacles about the evil of the system. The kiss-off was inevitable: \u201c<em>The Matrix</em>,\u201d he said, \u201cis surely the kind of film about the matrix that the matrix would have been able to produce.\u201d He let slip that overtures had been made but he had declined any involvement in the sequels. (As salt in the wound, he also said he preferred David Lynch\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/14/mulholland-drive-review-david-lynch\" title=\"\">Mulholland Drive</a></em>.)</p> <p>His decision-making proved sound. Two follow-ups \u2013 <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/may/23/artsfeatures.dvdreviews\" title=\"\">Reloaded</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/may/23/artsfeatures.dvdreviews\" title=\"\"> </a>and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,4267,1079198,00.html\" title=\"\">Revolutions</a></em> \u2013 were released back-to-back in 2003. They were both bitter letdowns, cliched and confused. Somewhere there was what might have been a nod to Baudrillard\u2019s complaints, but the delivery was so hamfisted, it barely registered. The Wachowskis never quite regained their lustre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e4950a041cd79f45a864ae49e663310ecb95bfa8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4950a041cd79f45a864ae49e663310ecb95bfa8/482_0_1668_1001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Letdown \u2026 The Matrix Reloaded.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Letdown \u2026 The Matrix Reloaded.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Should it matter? In other ways you might almost call real-world, they set an important example. At first glance, <em>The Matrix</em> shared some of Hollywood\u2019s worst habits \u2013 among its influences was the Japanese anime <em>Ghost </em><em>in </em><em>the Shell</em>, an inspiration from another culture, refitted with a white hero. Yet Neo\u2019s enlightenment lay with people of colour, not just Morpheus but the cryptic Oracle played by Gloria Foster. And a subtle blurring of sexual signals put a twist in the on-screen relationship between Reeves and Moss, lovers <em>and</em> lookalikes in shades and with neat androgynous haircuts. Issues of identity would prove life-changing for the Wachowskis themselves, the results as groundbreaking as anything in their films. In 2008, Lana Wachowski completed her gender transition \u2013 the first and only Hollywood director to do so until, eight years later, her sister Lilly followed suit. To its creators, perhaps the matrix was the patriarchy and the war it waged on the authentic self, and their resistance to it was their greatest achievement.</p> <p>But everyone has a matrix and that ended up as a problem. As early as 1999, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/slavojzizek\" title=\"\">Slavoj \u017di\u017eek</a> had noted a hitch with the utopian prospectus for life online. Instead of the internet bringing people together, he wrote, it would dissolve us into a \u201cmultitude of \u2018small others\u2019 [and] tribal particular identifications\u201d. Later, in his regular takedowns of <em>The Matrix</em> \u2013 delivered with unfakeable contempt \u2013 \u017di\u017eek came to the same conclusion about the Wachowskis\u2019 film. That, for him, was the secret of its success.</p> <p>Their original intentions hardly mattered: whether the Wachowskis meant their red pill to represent a gateway to Baudrillard or an escape from norms of gender identity, the easy-access metaphor made it universally seductive. Asked if they could imagine what it felt like to be a lonely rebel, oppressed by dark forces distorting reality, it turned out pretty much everyone did \u2013 from Flat Earthers to neo-Nazis. As \u017di\u017eek put it in the documentary <em>The Pervert\u2019s Guide </em><em>to Cinema</em>: \u201cI want a third pill.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dbce850ceb110cbddcc96cee6c0b1c0e31b4afe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dbce850ceb110cbddcc96cee6c0b1c0e31b4afe/0_41_2496_1497/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Explosive scenes \u2026 bullet dodging in The Matrix.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Explosive scenes \u2026 bullet dodging in The Matrix.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Snap Stills/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Baudrillard died in 2007, a year before the financial crash saw the wheels come off hypercapitalism.

      "bodyText": "The Matrix has barely started when a phone booth is demolished, left as a smashed pancake of glass and metal. It was a prophetic touch. Payphones were still everywhere in western cities when the film came out in March 1999. By the time of the first sequel four years later, they were already half-vanished, replaced by a private army of Nokias and Motorolas. But now The Matrix is a relic too, a quaint slice of 90s nostalgia about to celebrate its 20th anniversary. \u201c1999\u201d, the recent song from Charli XCX and Troye Sivan, features wistful lyrics (\u201cThose days, it was so much better\u201d) and cover art in which the millennial pop stars wear the black leather costumes made famous by Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss as they battled the machines enslaving humanity. Yet for a relic, it never slipped far from view \u2013 still a familiar reference in a world divided between internet and IRL (in real life), its characters endlessly circulating in memes and gifs, often as vehicles for the acrid politics that define our 21st century. Back in the 20th, much of the highest excitement was reserved for the visuals \u2013 the \u201cdigital rain\u201d of green code, the bullets slowed to a stop while Reeves swayed around them. But the premise was what made it a phenomenon, the idea our whole reality might be a virtual concoction. How would we know? More ticklish still, would we want to? If, like Reeves\u2019s weary hacker Neo, we were approached by Laurence Fishburne\u2019s Morpheus, would we take the blue pill to return us to life as it merely seemed to be? Or the red that promised us \u2013 however terrible \u2013 the real? Of course, Neo chose red, as we told ourselves we would, too. The notion of the matrix hit a nerve. Despite sunlit economies and political stability, a strange ennui and mistrust of technology hung over the end of the 90s. People fretted about the \u201cmillennium bug\u201d and reality TV. In fact, as sibling co-creators the Wachowskis alluded to on screen, the film was just the latest in a long line of variations on a theme, nestled in the mainstream of philosophy. In the allegory of the cave, Plato presented humanity chained to a cave wall, taking passing shadows for reality. Then came the first meditation of Descartes (1641), speculating that everything his senses told him might just be the work of an \u201cevil demon\u201d. By the 1980s, we had the theory of the brain in the vat \u2013 built on the impossibility of ever knowing for sure that you aren\u2019t exactly that, your whole life simply electrical impulses wired into your tank. For the philosophers of 1999, The Matrix meant boom time. High-profile essay collections found existentialists, nihilists, Christian theologians, Zen Buddhists and a dozen other schools of thought throwing metaphysical buns at each other over the meaning of the movie. For a time, the shriek and whirr of your dial-up modem could take you \u2013 eventually \u2013 to the official Matrix website, where densely argued academic papers were hosted on the corporate dime of Warner Bros. But the mind to which the Wachowskis paid their deepest tribute was unimpressed. During the film, Neo pulls from a shelf a hardback, Simulacra and Simulation, by academic and provocateur Jean Baudrillard. While the pages were hollowed out to hold an illicit cache of computer disks, Reeves had been required by the Wachowskis to read the book, to better acquaint himself with the film\u2019s most treasured influence. A postmodernist darling, Baudrillard put forth a slippery but naggingly brilliant idea \u2013 that reality itself had been replaced with endless reproductions of what simply felt like it. Jobs, novels, architecture, ideologies, wars: they were all just copies and copies of copies of long gone originals. Take The Matrix \u2013 living on in those gifs, pop songs and this piece in the Guardian, but actually watched with vanishing rarity. Baudrillard called it \u201cthe desert of the real\u201d. The Wachowskis had Morpheus intone the phrase from a Chesterfield armchair set in the smoking ruins of our former civilisation. But the film only moved Baudrillard to protest that it was a misrepresentation. For him, \u201chypercapitalism\u201d had destroyed the very idea of reality \u2013 whereas The Matrix had a whole new one ready to go as soon as Neo could overthrow the machines. The theory of the brain in a vat contained a fiendish double bluff \u2013 from within your tank, you might even be prompted to wonder if you were just a floating brain. To Baudrillard, hypercapitalism was similarly deceptive, knowingly producing spectacles about the evil of the system. The kiss-off was inevitable: \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d he said, \u201cis surely the kind of film about the matrix that the matrix would have been able to produce.\u201d He let slip that overtures had been made but he had declined any involvement in the sequels. (As salt in the wound, he also said he preferred David Lynch\u2019s Mulholland Drive.) His decision-making proved sound. Two follow-ups \u2013 Reloaded and Revolutions \u2013 were released back-to-back in 2003. They were both bitter letdowns, cliched and confused. Somewhere there was what might have been a nod to Baudrillard\u2019s complaints, but the delivery was so hamfisted, it barely registered. The Wachowskis never quite regained their lustre. Should it matter? In other ways you might almost call real-world, they set an important example. At first glance, The Matrix shared some of Hollywood\u2019s worst habits \u2013 among its influences was the Japanese anime Ghost in the Shell, an inspiration from another culture, refitted with a white hero. Yet Neo\u2019s enlightenment lay with people of colour, not just Morpheus but the cryptic Oracle played by Gloria Foster. And a subtle blurring of sexual signals put a twist in the on-screen relationship between Reeves and Moss, lovers and lookalikes in shades and with neat androgynous haircuts. Issues of identity would prove life-changing for the Wachowskis themselves, the results as groundbreaking as anything in their films. In 2008, Lana Wachowski completed her gender transition \u2013 the first and only Hollywood director to do so until, eight years later, her sister Lilly followed suit. To its creators, perhaps the matrix was the patriarchy and the war it waged on the authentic self, and their resistance to it was their greatest achievement. But everyone has a matrix and that ended up as a problem. As early as 1999, Slavoj \u017di\u017eek had noted a hitch with the utopian prospectus for life online. Instead of the internet bringing people together, he wrote, it would dissolve us into a \u201cmultitude of \u2018small others\u2019 [and] tribal particular identifications\u201d. Later, in his regular takedowns of The Matrix \u2013 delivered with unfakeable contempt \u2013 \u017di\u017eek came to the same conclusion about the Wachowskis\u2019 film. That, for him, was the secret of its success. Their original intentions hardly mattered: whether the Wachowskis meant their red pill to represent a gateway to Baudrillard or an escape from norms of gender identity, the easy-access metaphor made it universally seductive. Asked if they could imagine what it felt like to be a lonely rebel, oppressed by dark forces distorting reality, it turned out pretty much everyone did \u2013 from Flat Earthers to neo-Nazis. As \u017di\u017eek put it in the documentary The Pervert\u2019s Guide to Cinema: \u201cI want a third pill.\u201d Baudrillard died in 2007, a year before the financial crash saw the wheels come off hypercapitalism. He may not have been surprised that confronted by a genuine rip in the fabric of the system, the response among both public and politicians was a frantic attempt to go back to normal and never mention it again. Instead, a bogus new reality arose \u2013 the reanimated far-right. With awful irony, the stunted boys of 4chan and Reddit appropriated The Matrix. To \u201credpill\u201d became a verb, opening the eyes of new recruits to their hated oppressors \u2013 feminists, people of colour and progressives. Morpheus became the face of memes that asked: \u201cWhat If I Told You Hitler Was A Socialist?\u201d And here we are now, in the Britain of 2019. It is, of course, pure Baudrillard, a country manically returning to an earlier version of itself that never existed. Our unreality is operating at a heightened pitch.

The number of teenage pregnancies recorded at the centre has doubled, from eight in 2017 to 16 in 2018.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the number of people taking tests for sexually transmitted infections and HIV has slumped. \u201cPeople will only come if they are not feeling well,\u201d says Zulu.</p> <p>Until November 2017, a project run by Planned Parenthood Association of Zambia (PPAZ) would offer HIV testing in homes, distribute condoms in the community, and give family planning information to teenagers in schools.</p> <p>Such work was halted by the Mexico City policy, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2017/jan/18/what-is-the-global-gag-rule-and-why-does-trump-support-it-video\">\u201cglobal gag rule\u201d</a>, signed two years ago by Trump, which blocked US funds to any organisations involved in abortion advice and care overseas. The policy has been imposed by Republican presidents since Ronald Reagan in 1984, but Trump\u2019s measure was more wide-reaching than ever before. Campaigners estimated that 15 times more funding would be affected. Women\u2019s rights groups and health experts warned that progress on family planning, population growth and reproductive rights would be swept away.</p> <p>Rural areas such as Nyangwena, which were once prioritised by US aid, are thought to have been hardest hit. Here in Rufunsa district, and across Chongwe and Livingstone, projects tackling teenage pregnancies and HIV, run by PPAZ, were all cut. The organisation, which is a member of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, lost almost half of its annual operating budget in 2017, with access to a $3.8m (\u00a33m) fund cut off.</p> <p>More than 70 community members \u2013 who, in exchange for a small monthly stipend, provided a range of outreach care \u2013 were let go. Seventeen staff members lost their jobs. Salome Sichali, programme office at PPAZ, cried when she told the community. \u201cThere were 70-plus people whose lives were shattered, and abruptly.\u201d</p> <p>Community leaders asked how people would be able to access services or condoms, which PPAZ had been making available at collection points in shops and near to bars. Today, the entire district of Rufunsa, home to 68,000 people, receives government packages of up to seven boxes, each containing 144 condoms every month. These are shared between 23 health facilities.</p> <p>Promises that services would be taken over by alternative partners haven\u2019t been kept. Of the 16 sites operated by PPAZ, only three are now running. \u201cEven today people call and ask what is happening. We just say I\u2019m not sure,\u201d says Sichali.</p> <p>The same pattern is seen elsewhere, campaigners warn. \u201cThere is this narrative from the US government that when providers they have been partnering with are cut out, other partners can come in and fill that void. That\u2019s just not something we\u2019re seeing,\u201d says Jonathan Rucks, senior director of advocacy at PAI, an advocacy group.</p> <p>Sichali fears progress made in parts of Zambia \u2013 where teenage pregnancy rates <a href=\"https://www.lusakatimes.com/2018/04/08/teenage-pregnancy-statistics-stand-at-29-percent/\">stand at 29%</a> and nearly a third of girls are <a href=\"https://www.girlsnotbrides.org/child-marriage/zambia/\">married before the age of 18</a> \u2013 is at risk of going backwards.</p> <p>In the past, organisations affected by the global gag rule were mostly focused on family planning. Today, services are much more integrated \u2013 which means everything from HIV treatment to child and maternal health can be affected by funding cuts.</p> <p>Nyangwena health centre has just two community workers delivering HIV care, and one overseeing tuberculosis cases. For a facility serving 3,270 people over a vast rural area, it isn\u2019t enough.</p> <p>\u201cPeople will end up dying in the community because we are not following them,\u201d says Brenda Simakuni, who works as a counsellor for Chiyota health post, also in Rufunsa.</p> <p>Already, reports in Rufunsa are gravely concerning. \u201cLast month we lost a boy aged 20,\u201d says Simakuni. \u201cHe started taking medication and all of a sudden he just stopped. He told parents that he was tired of taking the drugs.\u201d Health workers had tried to counsel him during follow-up visits, she adds, but he had struggled to accept that he was HIV positive. There aren\u2019t enough resources to do comprehensive follow-ups for all patients.</p> <p>Simakuni is especially worried about the effect that service cuts will have on girls, whose health, safety and education is at stake. She was previously a community counsellor with PPAZ, but is now unpaid. At a local school, where she has taught about family planning, seven of the students in grade nine \u2013 where children are as young as 15 \u2013 were sitting their end-of-term exams in November while pregnant.</p> <p>Not far from Nyangwena health centre, Juliet Banda, 16, is sitting outside the house where she lives with her grandmothers. Three years ago, she dropped out of school because her family couldn\u2019t afford the fees. She began a relationship with a 22-year-old man who promised he would marry her and pay for her education. When she became pregnant five months later, he disappeared.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d4206b57d00963c2c07c90db152fe782ccca809\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d4206b57d00963c2c07c90db152fe782ccca809/0_261_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two grandmothers crush stones outside their home to support their teenage granddaughter and her baby\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two grandmothers crush stones outside their home to support their teenage granddaughter and her baby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cynthia R Matonhodze/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be at school,\u201d she says through a translator, as her 18-month-old baby sleeps indoors. \u201cScience was [my] favourite subject. I was learning a lot about human beings.\u201d Juliet would like to be a nurse, specialising in midwifery. She isn\u2019t working, and depends on the income her grandmothers make through crushing stones.</p> <p>Young women in Zambia are among those most vulnerable to HIV. Entering into \u201csugar daddy\u201d relationships with older men, who are often the least likely to go to a clinic and get tested, heightens the risk. PPAZ introduced savings groups for young women who could become involved in transactional relationships, though now that services have been cut, some of the groups have become dormant.</p> <p>\u201cThe concern is that these young girls could be susceptible to contracting the virus,\u201d says Sichali. \u201cThey don\u2019t have access to income generating activities.\u201d</p> <p>Zambian students are taught sex education in schools, which includes age appropriate information about sex and issues such as gender-based violence. Such efforts are hampered, however, by the variability in teaching quality. And while PPAZ previously sent peer educators into schools, this work is now much more sporadic.</p> <p>There are also strict rules preventing children under 16 from accessing condoms without parental consent. Even if children are able to seek their family\u2019s permission to get them, many will only be able to access contraceptives at facilities that could require a three-hour journey on foot. \u201cIf you look at the vastness of our areas, the health services are few. These long distances are a challenge,\u201d says Muleya Hateya, adolescent health focal point for Rufunsa district. \u201cSome [areas] will get cut off during rainy season.\u201d</p> <p>Across Rufunsa, changes to the way statistics are collected makes it hard to judge whether or not teen pregnancies are increasing. The number of pregnancies among 19-year-olds are now included and there are greater efforts to report. But the figures are worrying. During the first three-quarters of 2018, 629 teen pregnancies were recorded, compared with 227 during the whole of 2017.</p> <p>While statistics for teenage pregnancies are limited, even less is known about how service cuts may have affected the number of unsafe abortions, which are routinely unreported.</p> <p>The wider impact of the global gag rule will be impossible to measure according to Elizabeth Sully, a senior research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, who is investigating the effect of the funding cut. Where replacement funding is found, it is not known where that money would have been going otherwise in the healthcare system, she says. Nor is it possible to quantify the loss of trust in communities where services have suddenly stopped.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in the times of saying no one gets left behind in terms of healthcare,\u201d says Sichali. \u201cWe had planned activities and we were monitoring what was working and what wasn\u2019t along the way. We made progress but we needed to finish.\u201d</p>",

Sichali fears progress made in parts of Zambia \u2013 where teenage pregnancy rates stand at 29% and nearly a third of girls are married before the age of 18 \u2013 is at risk of going backwards. In the past, organisations affected by the global gag rule were mostly focused on family planning. Today, services are much more integrated \u2013 which means everything from HIV treatment to child and maternal health can be affected by funding cuts. Nyangwena health centre has just two community workers delivering HIV care, and one overseeing tuberculosis cases. For a facility serving 3,270 people over a vast rural area, it isn\u2019t enough. \u201cPeople will end up dying in the community because we are not following them,\u201d says Brenda Simakuni, who works as a counsellor for Chiyota health post, also in Rufunsa. Already, reports in Rufunsa are gravely concerning. \u201cLast month we lost a boy aged 20,\u201d says Simakuni. \u201cHe started taking medication and all of a sudden he just stopped. He told parents that he was tired of taking the drugs.\u201d Health workers had tried to counsel him during follow-up visits, she adds, but he had struggled to accept that he was HIV positive. There aren\u2019t enough resources to do comprehensive follow-ups for all patients. Simakuni is especially worried about the effect that service cuts will have on girls, whose health, safety and education is at stake. She was previously a community counsellor with PPAZ, but is now unpaid. At a local school, where she has taught about family planning, seven of the students in grade nine \u2013 where children are as young as 15 \u2013 were sitting their end-of-term exams in November while pregnant. Not far from Nyangwena health centre, Juliet Banda, 16, is sitting outside the house where she lives with her grandmothers. Three years ago, she dropped out of school because her family couldn\u2019t afford the fees. She began a relationship with a 22-year-old man who promised he would marry her and pay for her education. When she became pregnant five months later, he disappeared. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be at school,\u201d she says through a translator, as her 18-month-old baby sleeps indoors. \u201cScience was [my] favourite subject. I was learning a lot about human beings.\u201d Juliet would like to be a nurse, specialising in midwifery. She isn\u2019t working, and depends on the income her grandmothers make through crushing stones. Young women in Zambia are among those most vulnerable to HIV. Entering into \u201csugar daddy\u201d relationships with older men, who are often the least likely to go to a clinic and get tested, heightens the risk. PPAZ introduced savings groups for young women who could become involved in transactional relationships, though now that services have been cut, some of the groups have become dormant. \u201cThe concern is that these young girls could be susceptible to contracting the virus,\u201d says Sichali. \u201cThey don\u2019t have access to income generating activities.\u201d Zambian students are taught sex education in schools, which includes age appropriate information about sex and issues such as gender-based violence. Such efforts are hampered, however, by the variability in teaching quality. And while PPAZ previously sent peer educators into schools, this work is now much more sporadic. There are also strict rules preventing children under 16 from accessing condoms without parental consent. Even if children are able to seek their family\u2019s permission to get them, many will only be able to access contraceptives at facilities that could require a three-hour journey on foot. \u201cIf you look at the vastness of our areas, the health services are few. These long distances are a challenge,\u201d says Muleya Hateya, adolescent health focal point for Rufunsa district. \u201cSome [areas] will get cut off during rainy season.\u201d Across Rufunsa, changes to the way statistics are collected makes it hard to judge whether or not teen pregnancies are increasing. The number of pregnancies among 19-year-olds are now included and there are greater efforts to report. But the figures are worrying. During the first three-quarters of 2018, 629 teen pregnancies were recorded, compared with 227 during the whole of 2017. While statistics for teenage pregnancies are limited, even less is known about how service cuts may have affected the number of unsafe abortions, which are routinely unreported. The wider impact of the global gag rule will be impossible to measure according to Elizabeth Sully, a senior research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, who is investigating the effect of the funding cut. Where replacement funding is found, it is not known where that money would have been going otherwise in the healthcare system, she says. Nor is it possible to quantify the loss of trust in communities where services have suddenly stopped. \u201cWe are in the times of saying no one gets left behind in terms of healthcare,\u201d says Sichali. \u201cWe had planned activities and we were monitoring what was working and what wasn\u2019t along the way. We made progress but we needed to finish.\u201d",

Words begin to lose their meaning. Poetry occupies a different space to the humdrum. It is a way of renewing what words actually mean. It offers you a different way of looking at the world.\u201d</p> <p>A comparable boom in the popularity of poetry was seen during the miners\u2019 strike in the 1980s and during the rise of Chartism in the 19th century, according to Katy Shaw, professor of contemporary writings at Northumbria University.</p> <p>\u201cTo me, it\u2019s no coincidence that poetry as a form is being used to critically discuss events like Grenfell, the Manchester bombing and Brexit as well,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s being repurposed as this really dynamic and vital form that can capture, in a very condensed way, the turbulent nature of contemporary society \u2013 and give us the space to struggle with our desire to understand and negotiate a lot of what is going on at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Like the miners and Chartists did before them, people are reading and sharing poetry not to passively reflect on what\u2019s going on in society, but as a way of engaging, said Shaw. \u201cPoetry as a form can capture the immediate responses of people to divisive and controversial current events. It questions who has the authority to put their narrative forward, when it is written by people who don\u2019t otherwise hold this power,\u201d she said. \u201cWriting poetry and sharing it in this context is a radical event, an act of resistance to encourage other people to come round to your perspective.\u201d</p> <p>Social media and technology have made poetry much easier to access and pass along, magnifying its impact, Shaw said: \u201cIn the miners\u2019 strike, we had poetry being written on the side of instruction manuals and printed on typewriters, distributed by hand or sent through the post. Similarly, we have evidence of a lot of Chartist poetry being publicly read out and shared between different groups of workers.</p> <p>\u201cBut poetry has a strong oral tradition \u2013 it wasn\u2019t always written down, people would learn it and recite it. The one great advantage we have now is the speed at which we can share new work.\u201d</p>",

Andre Breedt, for Nielsen, said that sales were booming because in times of political upheaval and uncertainty, people turn to poems to make sense of the world: \u201cPoetry is resonating with people who are looking for understanding. It is a really good way to explore complex, difficult emotions and uncertainty.\u201d He added that the form\u2019s brevity also meant it could be easily consumed on phones and shared on social media. In the immediate aftermath of the Manchester bombing, Tony Walsh\u2019s reading of his poem, This Is the Place, at Manchester town hall was shared thousands of times online and became instantly famous worldwide. Ben Okri\u2019s poem Grenfell Tower, June, 2017, written in the aftermath of the fire, followed a similar trajectory. \u201cAt these moments of national crisis, the words that spread and the words that were heard were not the words of politicians, they were the words of poets,\u201d said Susannah Herbert, director of the Forward Arts Foundation, which runs the Forward prizes for poetry and National Poetry Day. \u201cAlmost everything a politician says is incredibly forgettable. There is a hunger out there for more nuanced and memorable forms of language.\u201d People wanted to cut through the verbiage of Brexit to see the bigger picture in 2018, she said: \u201cLanguage gets stale in politics. Words begin to lose their meaning. Poetry occupies a different space to the humdrum. It is a way of renewing what words actually mean. It offers you a different way of looking at the world.\u201d A comparable boom in the popularity of poetry was seen during the miners\u2019 strike in the 1980s and during the rise of Chartism in the 19th century, according to Katy Shaw, professor of contemporary writings at Northumbria University. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s no coincidence that poetry as a form is being used to critically discuss events like Grenfell, the Manchester bombing and Brexit as well,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s being repurposed as this really dynamic and vital form that can capture, in a very condensed way, the turbulent nature of contemporary society \u2013 and give us the space to struggle with our desire to understand and negotiate a lot of what is going on at the moment.\u201d Like the miners and Chartists did before them, people are reading and sharing poetry not to passively reflect on what\u2019s going on in society, but as a way of engaging, said Shaw. \u201cPoetry as a form can capture the immediate responses of people to divisive and controversial current events. It questions who has the authority to put their narrative forward, when it is written by people who don\u2019t otherwise hold this power,\u201d she said. \u201cWriting poetry and sharing it in this context is a radical event, an act of resistance to encourage other people to come round to your perspective.\u201d Social media and technology have made poetry much easier to access and pass along, magnifying its impact, Shaw said: \u201cIn the miners\u2019 strike, we had poetry being written on the side of instruction manuals and printed on typewriters, distributed by hand or sent through the post. Similarly, we have evidence of a lot of Chartist poetry being publicly read out and shared between different groups of workers. \u201cBut poetry has a strong oral tradition \u2013 it wasn\u2019t always written down, people would learn it and recite it. The one great advantage we have now is the speed at which we can share new work.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "When the actor Paul Chahidi was leaving drama school, he met a seasoned agent. Suit and tie, leather chairs, schooner of white wine at 3pm. Old school. \u201cHe sat down, a bit too close to me,\u201d Chahidi remembers, \u201cand said: \u2018Three things you should know about yourself \u2013 one, you\u2019ve got a funny foreign name; two, you\u2019re losing your hair; three, you\u2019ll never play Romeo. But you can act \u2013 and with that we can go a long way.\u2019\u201d Chahidi was too surprised to take offence. \u201cAnd it turned out he was right.\u201d Star players often begin as winsome, floppy-haired Romeos or Juliets. But pretty doesn\u2019t always endure \u2013 for longevity, look to the odd. \u201cI was a character actor from the very beginning and not really sold as pretty,\u201d Susan Sarandon told the Guardian in 2017, \u201cwhich is probably what\u2019s allowed me to survive as long as I have.\u201d What makes a character actor? Consider a litany of cherished survivors: Julie Walters and Alison Steadman, Toby Jones and Jim Broadbent, Imelda Staunton and Timothy Spall. They play the un-cheekboned, the anti-suave, the awkward stumblers through life and love. No wonder they are so often beloved: they speak for people like us. Chahidi\u2019s precision work on television (buoyant vicar in This Country), film (quivering apparatchik in The Death of Stalin) and stage (Maria in the Globe\u2019s all-male Twelfth Night) might seem the essence of character acting but he\u2019s no fan of the term. \u201cIt does seem a little bit dated, and sometimes you sense there\u2019s something reductive in it,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIs Meryl Streep a character actor? Mark Rylance? In a sense, who cares? You can either convince as the character or you can\u2019t. In my mind it comes down to whether they are transformative or not.\u201d The earliest instances of the term in the Oxford English Dictionary date from the mid-19th century and suggest actors noted for idiosyncratic and eccentric roles. As a concept, it is far older \u2013 theatre historian Gilli Bush-Bailey traces it back at least to the Restoration, where particular actors specialised in fops, bumpkins or harridans, and believes that the mid-20th century repertory system solidified the notion. Weekly rep, with minimal rehearsal, had no time for left-field casting. People were required to play to type. Bush-Bailey\u2019s parents were both actors whose careers were shaped by precisely these notions. Her mother, \u201cvery tall and quite gawky\u201d, was brought up in upper-middle-class society, presented at court and \u201ccould not do accents to save her life\u201d yet she was repeatedly cast as barmaids and charladies. The rep system set expectations for drama schools and the wider profession. Chahidi points me towards vintage editions of Spotlight, the actors\u2019 directory. Actors are divided not only into gender but also \u201cLeading and Young Leading\u201d actors or \u201cCharacter Men/Women and Comedians\u201d. Character players stress their versatility, often through contrasting snapshots: ease with accents (\u201cfluent cockney\u201d), traversing class (pairing photos in top hat and flat cap) and age. A young Warren Mitchell presents himself in street-savvy denim and as a dinner-jacketed old duffer. Joyce Hemson advances her \u201ccharacter comedy \u2013 tarts, barmaids, charwomen, etc\u201d. No wonder modern actors bridle at a term that seems mired in Britain\u2019s class system. In 1966, the character sections housed \u201cthe world\u2019s most travelled TV cat impersonator\u201d alongside emerging comic stars such as Penelope Keith and Nigel Hawthorne. There too, gazing moodily from the pages, is a youthful Brian Cox. \u201cIt\u2019s such a long time ago,\u201d the star of Succession sighs on the phone from New York. \u201cIn the 1960s, there was this differential. But then came people like Albert Finney, Tom Courtenay and Alan Bates. They\u2019re all characterful men, so it was very much the thing to be.\u201d Now in his 70s, Cox has \u201calways believed in the long haul,\u201d he says. \u201cI never thought of myself as a juvenile leading man.\u201d He did play classical leads \u2013 Titus Andronicus at the RSC, Lear at the National \u2013 but then aimed at US cinema. \u201cFilm is an egalitarian medium,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if an actor is only on set for one day, that\u2019s their day \u2026 I like to be a commando: going in and getting out.\u201d Even his protagonists, as in the recent film The Etruscan Smile, may \u201ccarry the story, but are very much character roles\u201d.

In 1938, during what Austrian Jews would later bitterly name \u201cthe November pogrom\u201d \u2013 it began with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2013/nov/08/kristallnacht-guardian-archive-1938\" title=\"\">Kristallnacht</a> \u2013 peace-loving Gustav, a decorated war veteran, and his son Fritz, 15, were rounded up on the eager testimony of their non-Jewish neighbours.</p> <p>A year later, Gustav, after failing to rescue his boy from a second arrest and instant deportation \u2013 the Kleinmanns\u2019 crime, on both occasions, was to be Jewish \u2013 was snatched at night from the family home he had courageously refused to abandon. In October 1939, he was dispatched to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1945/apr/18/secondworldwar.germany\" title=\"\">Buchenwald</a>. And so, by a freak of fate, was Fritz.</p> <p>Doubtless, in the awful history of planned genocide we know as the Holocaust, other family members found one another and clung together during a pilgrimage through the rapidly multiplying work camps and extermination sites of Germany, Poland and Austria. Few can have recorded that story with such defiant care as Gustav Kleinmann.</p> <p>Somehow, throughout five years of methodically vicious incarceration, Gustav (his inspiration during the starvation he continuously endured was Gandhi) managed to maintain and conceal a sparsely kept diary. This journal, published with Fritz\u2019s memoir as <em>The Dog Will Not Die</em> (1995), forms the bedrock of Jeremy Dronfield\u2019s novelistic retelling of those terrible years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f759b6da7a3ea5cd76b353b51da46a1ecd0303cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f759b6da7a3ea5cd76b353b51da46a1ecd0303cc/367_131_2794_1677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Kleinmann family in 1938 featuring Gustav (second left) and Fritz (fourth left)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Kleinmann family in 1938 featuring Gustav (second left) and Fritz (fourth left).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Patten</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a reviewer, it feels almost indecent to dwell upon the horrors inflicted, day by day, month after month, upon the innocent. Bizarre details stick in the mind: the meticulously kept flowerbeds; the garish Teutonic halls built for the enjoyment of thuggish guards by an army of slaves. At Buchenwald, <a href=\"https://www.buchenwald.de/en/543/\" title=\"\">Goethe\u2019s Oak</a>, located along one of the great writer\u2019s favourite walks, was put to regular use for crucifixions. A hill nearby, once used for deer hunts, became a hunting ground for men. (Tricking prisoners to cross an invisible boundary line by a tossed cap made them fair game. \u201cAnd the fool runs,\u201d Gustav noted; each corpse won three days\u2019 holiday for a trigger-happy guard.)</p> <p>Ironies abound. While intellectuals and artists were ordered to gather shit in gloveless hands, applause was given when one sturdy young journalist managed to hurl rocks faster than the stone-crushing machine revved up to double time (in order to grind its victim down). His reward? A command to act as secretary to the illiterate <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapo_(concentration_camp)\" title=\"\">kapo</a></em> who had tried to kill him. Gustav, meanwhile, was ordered to join a choir, drowning out the shots being fired at Russian prisoners of war.</p> <p>It was when his father was abruptly moved from Buchenwald to Auschwitz that Fritz Kleinmann took the most momentous decision of his young life. Licensed to remain in relative safety, he requested to join Gustav on what both men believed was a journey towards certain death. (\u201cEverybody says it\u2019s a one-way ticket, only Fritz and I don\u2019t mope... you can only die once,\u201d Gustav wrote.) The worst, as this theatrical historian never forgets to remind his readers, was yet to come.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mauthausen was the destination towards which father and son were going when Gustav persuaded Fritz to leap from a train</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Anyone new to Auschwitz history may be unaware, as I was, that one of its objectives was to set up a local camp at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monowitz_concentration_camp\" title=\"\">Monowitz</a> that would harbour a workforce to speed up the building (for the flagging war effort) of a nearby chemical factory. Monowitz, when Fritz and Gustav arrived, was a fenced and mud-sodden field of sheds \u2013 no kitchen, no sanitation, no heat \u2013 to which they were marched for three hours each day before working on the uncompleted factory. Here, swiftly identifying their skills in bricklaying and stitching, the Kleinmanns stayed alive while up to 150 of their less useful comrades went off each day to be gassed at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/27/auschwitz-short-history-liberation-concentration-camp-holocaust\" title=\"\">Birkenau</a> (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/primolevi\" title=\"\">Primo Levi</a> was another survivor).</p> <p>The ironies continue. Gustav\u2019s new ally at Monowitz was an ex-soldier and co-worker who simply couldn\u2019t credit that Hitler would imprison Jews without cause. But neither could Gustav credit the number of closed trains he saw carrying thousands of Hungarian Jews to their deaths. \u201cAnd all this in the 20th century,\u201d he wrote with disbelief. A year later, starving at <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/mauthausen\" title=\"\">Mauthausen</a>, a camp in Upper Austria, Gustav barely escaped being massacred by ferociously antisemitic Hungarian guards. (The Russians, by contrast, treated all camp inmates with respect.)</p> <p>Mauthausen was the destination towards which father and son were going when Gustav persuaded his son to leap from a speeding train of starving men and corpses, out into a snowdrift.

      "bodyText": "The photograph at the beginning of this devastating book shows what may have been the last gathering of the Vienna-based family of Gustav Kleinmann, upholsterer. In 1938, during what Austrian Jews would later bitterly name \u201cthe November pogrom\u201d \u2013 it began with Kristallnacht \u2013 peace-loving Gustav, a decorated war veteran, and his son Fritz, 15, were rounded up on the eager testimony of their non-Jewish neighbours. A year later, Gustav, after failing to rescue his boy from a second arrest and instant deportation \u2013 the Kleinmanns\u2019 crime, on both occasions, was to be Jewish \u2013 was snatched at night from the family home he had courageously refused to abandon. In October 1939, he was dispatched to Buchenwald. And so, by a freak of fate, was Fritz. Doubtless, in the awful history of planned genocide we know as the Holocaust, other family members found one another and clung together during a pilgrimage through the rapidly multiplying work camps and extermination sites of Germany, Poland and Austria. Few can have recorded that story with such defiant care as Gustav Kleinmann. Somehow, throughout five years of methodically vicious incarceration, Gustav (his inspiration during the starvation he continuously endured was Gandhi) managed to maintain and conceal a sparsely kept diary. This journal, published with Fritz\u2019s memoir as The Dog Will Not Die (1995), forms the bedrock of Jeremy Dronfield\u2019s novelistic retelling of those terrible years. For a reviewer, it feels almost indecent to dwell upon the horrors inflicted, day by day, month after month, upon the innocent. Bizarre details stick in the mind: the meticulously kept flowerbeds; the garish Teutonic halls built for the enjoyment of thuggish guards by an army of slaves. At Buchenwald, Goethe\u2019s Oak, located along one of the great writer\u2019s favourite walks, was put to regular use for crucifixions. A hill nearby, once used for deer hunts, became a hunting ground for men. (Tricking prisoners to cross an invisible boundary line by a tossed cap made them fair game. \u201cAnd the fool runs,\u201d Gustav noted; each corpse won three days\u2019 holiday for a trigger-happy guard.) Ironies abound. While intellectuals and artists were ordered to gather shit in gloveless hands, applause was given when one sturdy young journalist managed to hurl rocks faster than the stone-crushing machine revved up to double time (in order to grind its victim down). His reward? A command to act as secretary to the illiterate kapo who had tried to kill him. Gustav, meanwhile, was ordered to join a choir, drowning out the shots being fired at Russian prisoners of war. It was when his father was abruptly moved from Buchenwald to Auschwitz that Fritz Kleinmann took the most momentous decision of his young life. Licensed to remain in relative safety, he requested to join Gustav on what both men believed was a journey towards certain death. (\u201cEverybody says it\u2019s a one-way ticket, only Fritz and I don\u2019t mope... you can only die once,\u201d Gustav wrote.) The worst, as this theatrical historian never forgets to remind his readers, was yet to come. Anyone new to Auschwitz history may be unaware, as I was, that one of its objectives was to set up a local camp at Monowitz that would harbour a workforce to speed up the building (for the flagging war effort) of a nearby chemical factory. Monowitz, when Fritz and Gustav arrived, was a fenced and mud-sodden field of sheds \u2013 no kitchen, no sanitation, no heat \u2013 to which they were marched for three hours each day before working on the uncompleted factory. Here, swiftly identifying their skills in bricklaying and stitching, the Kleinmanns stayed alive while up to 150 of their less useful comrades went off each day to be gassed at Birkenau (Primo Levi was another survivor). The ironies continue. Gustav\u2019s new ally at Monowitz was an ex-soldier and co-worker who simply couldn\u2019t credit that Hitler would imprison Jews without cause. But neither could Gustav credit the number of closed trains he saw carrying thousands of Hungarian Jews to their deaths. \u201cAnd all this in the 20th century,\u201d he wrote with disbelief. A year later, starving at Mauthausen, a camp in Upper Austria, Gustav barely escaped being massacred by ferociously antisemitic Hungarian guards. (The Russians, by contrast, treated all camp inmates with respect.) Mauthausen was the destination towards which father and son were going when Gustav persuaded his son to leap from a speeding train of starving men and corpses, out into a snowdrift. If there are moments when Dronfield\u2019s extraordinary book sounds more like a peculiarly gruesome thriller, readers should remind themselves that none of this is fiction. These horrors happened. Witnesses such as Gustav and Fritz survived and told their tales to ensure that their past should never be repeated. The rest is up to us. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 January 2019 to clarify the location of the Mauthausen camp. \u2022 The Boy Who Followed His Father Into Auschwitz by Jeremy Dronfield is published by Michael Joseph (\u00a312.99).

One source told the Guardian that \u201cno actual solutions\u201d were proposed in May\u2019s conference call with Cabinet members last night. \u201cIt is difficult to know \u2013 as ever \u2013 what she will do,\u201d another told the Guardian. \u201cBut the broad agreement is on the need to bring DUP and Tory rebels on board.\u201d Sources inside the government say May\u2019s overriding priority is to prevent a historic split in the Tory party, with rumours circulating that there could be a breakaway if the PM opted for a customs union.</p> <p>As Brexit shakes the foundations of the Tory party, Jeremy Corbyn is likely to refrain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/20/corbyn-holds-back-from-conceding-to-calls-for-second-eu-referendum\">from making fresh moves </a>towards backing a second referendum until after plan B is voted on later this month, as he too seeks to balance pressure from rival wings of his party.</p> <p>UK warehouse space meanwhile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/21/uk-warehouse-space-nears-capacity-firms-stockpile-for-brexit\">is nearing capacity as firms stockpile for Brexit</a>.

Abbott accused the programme of legitimising racist abuse, claiming she was repeatedly interrupted and singled out before the episode.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Cabinet bitterly divided over Irish border conundrum This is Alison Rourke with today\u2019s briefing as Theresa May prepares to set out her Brexit Plan B. The PM is expected to reject calls for a cross-party consensus on Brexit when she addresses parliament today and instead back new diplomatic efforts in Brussels to renegotiate the Irish backstop. One source told the Guardian that \u201cno actual solutions\u201d were proposed in May\u2019s conference call with Cabinet members last night. \u201cIt is difficult to know \u2013 as ever \u2013 what she will do,\u201d another told the Guardian. \u201cBut the broad agreement is on the need to bring DUP and Tory rebels on board.\u201d Sources inside the government say May\u2019s overriding priority is to prevent a historic split in the Tory party, with rumours circulating that there could be a breakaway if the PM opted for a customs union. As Brexit shakes the foundations of the Tory party, Jeremy Corbyn is likely to refrain from making fresh moves towards backing a second referendum until after plan B is voted on later this month, as he too seeks to balance pressure from rival wings of his party. UK warehouse space meanwhile is nearing capacity as firms stockpile for Brexit. Three-quarters of warehouse owners say they have no space left as costs have risen by 25% after a surge in Brexit-related inquiries. And in the first of our new series, Brexit frontline, Lisa O\u2019Carroll joins a British lorry driver trying to navigate the already difficult route through French ports, and hears how, with so much uncertainty, some haulage companies are making their own Brexit contingency plans. * * * EU citizen registration \u2013 Migration experts are warning that EU citizens living in the UK could become a new \u201cWindrush scandal\u201d as the scheme to register an estimated 3.5 million people begins. From today, the third phase of testing will open to EU residents in Britain, who will be able to register for the new post-Brexit \u201csettled status\u201d. The Home Office is extending its live trial to all EU citizens who hold a valid passport and any non-EU citizen family members who hold a valid biometric residence card. Critics have warned that thousands could be left without legal status to remain in the UK if applications are not processed quickly and effectively. * * * \u2018Appalled\u2019 \u2013 Labour has lodged a formal complaint with the BBC about the treatment of Diane Abbott on Question Time last week. Abbott accused the programme of legitimising racist abuse, claiming she was repeatedly interrupted and singled out before the episode. The party has demanded to see footage of the audience from a pre-show warm-up amid allegations the crowd in Derby had been \u201cwhipped up\u201d against Abbott. * * * House prices hit \u2013 Properties in some of Britain\u2019s wealthiest areas have had up to 25% wiped off their value in 12 months according to the estate agent Your Move. The figures come days after Britain\u2019s surveyors issued an especially gloomy assessment, fuelled by the lack of clarity over Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. On Thursday, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said house prices were falling at their fastest rate in six years, and that the outlook for sales was the weakest in two decades. * * * Praying in tongues \u2013 The archbishop of Canterbury says he speaks in tongues every day as part of his 5am prayer. \u201cGiven it\u2019s usually extremely early in the morning it\u2019s not usually an immensely ecstatic moment,\u201d Justin Welby says. He also says he expects to \u201chear from God through other people with words of knowledge or prophecies \u2013 some of which I am unsure about, others I can sense there being something of the spirit of God\u201d. \u201cWords of knowledge\u201d and \u201cprophecies\u201d are believed to be revelations from God about people or future events. Both are common in Pentecostal and \u201ccharismatic\u201d evangelical churches. * * * Lunar eclipse \u2013 Stargazers in parts of Britain have been treated to the spectacular sight of the super blood wolf moon. One Guardian reader in Stratford-upon-Avon wrote: \u201cClouds have rolled back and a great view of the eclipse.\u201d Cloudy skies over parts of London obscured the event for others. The rare celestial event takes places when moon is positioned slightly closer to earth than normal, and appears slightly bigger and brighter than normal. At the same time, the moon gave off a coppery red glow as it slipped into Earth\u2019s shadow. The \u201cwolf\u201d part of the name is because the event is happening in January, when wolves used to howl in hunger outside villages. Today in Focus podcast: What can we do, right now, about climate change? Calamitous weather events and warnings from scientists that the planet is warming faster than previously believed are causing alarm. Global environment editor, Jonathan Watts, describes the shifts needed to keep global warming to a maximum of 1.5C. Plus: David Conn on how football and gambling have become inseparable Lunchtime read: Glenn Close: \u2018You don\u2019t lose your sexuality as you get older\u2019 Over the next five weeks, the 71-year-old actor Glenn Close could well be collecting more statuettes, including at the Baftas and the Academy Awards for her performance in The Wife as Joan Castleman, the overlooked spouse of a Nobel-winning novelist, played by Jonathan Pryce. In Close\u2019s powerful speech when she won a Golden Globe for the role, she urged women \u201cto find personal fulfilment\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve been floored by the response,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are coming up to me in airports to talk about my speech.\u201d In The Wife, the opening sex scene was the first thing they shot. \u201cWe arrived on set in our jammies,\u201d she chuckled. Asked if it feels revolutionary to see two actors in their 70s having drowsy, vocal, pleasurably filthy sex together, she agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s one of the great myths that you lose your sexuality as you get older.\u201d Right now, she believes she is in her prime. \u201cI feel as free and as creative, as sexual and as eager as I ever have. And it\u2019s ironic because I\u2019m thinking: \u2018How much time do I have left now?\u2019\u201d Sport Five-time NFL champion Tom Brady guided the Patriots to another Super Bowl after Rex Burkhead\u2019s two-yard overtime touchdown lifted New England past Kansas City to secure the AFC championship. The Los Angeles Rams now stand in the Patriots\u2019 way, after a Greg Zuerlein field goal in overtime saw them down the New Orleans Saints in the NFC championship game. Jimmy Anderson acted as England\u2019s speaker in Barbados over the weekend and, on the subject of how much West Indian desire there is to beat the tourists in their upcoming Test series, apparently the eyes have it. Mauricio Pochettino admitted the hamstring injury which forced Dele Alli out of Tottenham\u2019s 2-1 win at Fulham did \u201cnot look great\u201d as he faced up to the loss of yet another key attacking player. There was no maiden Quad Series crown for England but, in the context of what is to come this year, another successful chapter in their captivating netball rivalry with Australia may be much more significant. Judd Trump won his first Masters snooker title with an emphatic 10-4 victory over Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan at Alexandra Palace. And Lindsey Vonn may have competed in her last ski race \u2013 after failing to finish a World Cup super-G on Sunday as she battles pain in both of her knees, Vonn said immediate retirement \u201cis a possibility\u201d. Business China\u2019s economic growth is at its slowest since 1990, according to new GDP figures. It grew 6.6% in 2018, amid the ongoing trade war with the US. The figures suggest that China may no longer be able to help shore up weakening global growth, as it has in the past. In gloomy news from the UK, more than 23,000 shops and 175,000 high street jobs are predicted to go this year, according to the annual report today from the real estate adviser Altus Group, as the shift to online shopping continues. The pound is trading at \u20ac1.13 and $1.79. The papers The Guardian splashes today on the news that Spice Girls T-shirts were made in a factory paying staff 35p an hour: \u201cRevealed: the poverty pay behind the charity slogans\u201d is that paper\u2019s headline. As Theresa May prepares to present her plan B to parliament, it\u2019s not surprising that many papers splash with variations of the story.

The country has made the moon exciting again by beaming back the first close-up images of its mysterious far side.

So what is driving the renaissance of lunar exploration?</p> <p>James Carpenter, a project scientist on the European Space Agency\u2019s lunar exploration team, believes that the latest interest goes beyond purely scientific goals. \u201cThere is a long-term motivation which is about sustained human presence in space,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we ever want to live and work in a permanent, economically sustainable way off Earth, this requires that we learn to use the resources we find there.\u201d</p> <p>The motivations for heading into space for longer periods include extracting valuable resources from the moon or asteroids, as well as a preparing for a \u201clifeboat scenario\u201d where the world becomes uninhabitable.</p> <p>At a press conference, officials said there would be three more missions after Chang\u2019e 5, a mission to return samples from the moon. By Chang\u2019e 8, China hopes to lay the foundation for a research base, including possibly building houses on lunar soil using 3D printing.</p> <p>Wu Weiren, the chief designer of the Chang\u2019e mission, told China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV: \u201cIt is human nature to explore the unknown world.

      "bodyText": "As Apollo 11 sailed above the moon, mission control in Houston suggested the astronauts should keep an eye out for a \u201cbeautiful Chinese girl called Chang-o\u201d, who, according to legend, had ascended to the moon thousands of years previously, taking along a large rabbit as a companion. \u201cI\u2019ll look out for the bunny girl then,\u201d Buzz Aldrin joked in reply, shortly ahead of his and Neil Armstrong\u2019s historic touchdown at the lunar surface. Nearly 50 years on, an astronaut gazing down from orbit might glimpse a hi-tech homage to the ancient folk tale. China\u2019s Chang\u2019e 4 probe this month became the first to land on the lunar far side, and nearby, hibernating during the lunar night, the Jade Rabbit rover is exploring this uncharted territory. The mission showcases China\u2019s ambition to become one of the world\u2019s major powers in space exploration. The country has made the moon exciting again by beaming back the first close-up images of its mysterious far side. Beijing does not disclose how much is spent on its space programme, but aims to build a space station and a base on the moon, as well as send a probe to Mars by 2020 and carry out a mission to Jupiter by 2029. Possibly spurred on by China\u2019s plans, other space agencies are showing a renewed interest in the moon, and landers from the US, India, Japan and Russia are planned over the next decade. So what is driving the renaissance of lunar exploration? James Carpenter, a project scientist on the European Space Agency\u2019s lunar exploration team, believes that the latest interest goes beyond purely scientific goals. \u201cThere is a long-term motivation which is about sustained human presence in space,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we ever want to live and work in a permanent, economically sustainable way off Earth, this requires that we learn to use the resources we find there.\u201d The motivations for heading into space for longer periods include extracting valuable resources from the moon or asteroids, as well as a preparing for a \u201clifeboat scenario\u201d where the world becomes uninhabitable. At a press conference, officials said there would be three more missions after Chang\u2019e 5, a mission to return samples from the moon. By Chang\u2019e 8, China hopes to lay the foundation for a research base, including possibly building houses on lunar soil using 3D printing. Wu Weiren, the chief designer of the Chang\u2019e mission, told China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV: \u201cIt is human nature to explore the unknown world. China is on the road to becoming a strong space nation.\u201d Preparing for living in space is a large element of the Chinese programme. Chang\u2019e 4\u2019s payload included experiments to investigate the presence of water in the lunar soil, as well as a miniature greenhouse to test the ability of plants and insects to survive in weak gravity. Back on Earth, students at Beihang University in Beijing ran a year-long experiment, Lunar Palace 1, in which students were housed in lunar-like conditions. Inside a module they grew potatoes, wheat and vegetables, and relied on oxygen and water that were recycled within the \u201cbioregenerative life support system\u201d. China is not alone in its ambitions on the moon. A Russian lander, scheduled for 2022, will attempt to drill into the south pole region and look at the potential for resource extraction, while ESA is planning experiments to harvest water and oxygen. Nasa is planning its first crewed mission around the moon in half a century for 2023. The prospect of China, the US and Europe competing to establish outposts and exploit the moon\u2019s resources has led to talk of a new space race, with some suggesting that China is now ahead. However, John Logsdon, professor emeritus of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, said that many have overstated China\u2019s recent accomplishments. He describes them as relatively modest when compared to Nasa\u2019s New Horizons mission, the first to perform a fly-by of a Kuiper Belt object, or Japan\u2019s Hayabusa 2 mission, set to land on an asteroid next month and return samples to Earth. \u201cChina\u2019s achievement is impressive, but it is not something fundamental or different from what other countries are doing,\u201d he said. For Logsdon, the key question in how the next phase of space exploration plays out is whether China becomes a collaborator with other countries or continues to compete. \u201cIt\u2019s really a broader question of Chinese-US relationships overall,\u201d he said. \u201cWill the two countries become peer competitors in military, economic and technical terms, or will they find ways of working together? What happens in space just dramatises that.\u201d Experts say other countries are likely to remain cautious about collaborating with China, despite some positive steps such as the inclusion of instruments aboard Chang\u2019e 4 developed by teams in Sweden and Germany. \u201cChina\u2019s reputation for stealing technology hurts chances for cooperation,\u201d said James Lewis, senior vice-president and director of the technology policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cChina sees itself as competing \u2013 when they drone on about the need for win-win, it\u2019s a sign that they think we are in a zero-sum game, where there can be only one winner.\u201d Because the Chinese military, the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), oversees the majority of what China does in space, there are also concerns about China\u2019s goal to deploy space systems to more effectively gather information than their adversaries \u2013 or block their adversaries\u2019 ability to do the same. Whichever way diplomatic relations in space play out, Carpenter said that nations and commercial players should be working to establish ground rules for the exploration of the moon and beyond. He added: \u201cSomething we\u2019ve learned from working on Earth is that we have to learn how to manage resources in a sustainable and ethical way. This is something that is certainly going to be part of the discussion \u2013 how we do this in a way that is responsible in the future, and how we create the rules and governance and legal framework to ensure we do that.\u201d",

Industry sources said the cost of warehouse space had risen by as much as a quarter in the final three months of 2018 as fears of no deal exacerbated capacity problems caused by rising demand from online retailers.

For Democrats, \u201cthe south\u201d has rapidly come to mean one thing more than anything else: the black vote. Black Americans now make up about 60% of Democratic voters in South Carolina.</p> <p>\u201cWhen southern black voters unite behind a Democratic candidate, the South becomes a formidable firewall that is hard to overcome for any candidate who performs poorly among this group,\u201d McKee wrote in a <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/2071412\">study</a> of the 2016 election.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Don\u2019t take it for a fact that black voters are going to blindly vote for another black person just because they\u2019re black</p> <footer> <cite>Jamira Burley</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How such votes are best earned remains up for debate. Speaking clearly and forcefully about civil rights on big stages is certainly part of the equation. But so is how black voters perceive a candidate\u2019s electability, and a knack for retail politics.</p> <p>\u201cAny candidate who wants to appeal to black voters is going to have to put real money into engagement, spend time meeting with organizations that represent their interests, listening to them, and allowing that feedback to actually impact their policy platform,\u201d said Jamira Burley, an engagement strategist for Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p> <p>That, she said, was a big part of why Clinton performed so well with black voters, beating Sanders by a whopping 47 points in South Carolina and racking up similar victories throughout the south, even as Sanders took several unexpected wins in the midwest. Throughout the contest, many commentators saw the south as <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-firewall-strategy-south-carolina-results-win-2016-2\">Clinton\u2019s own \u201cfirewall\u201d</a>.</p> <p>In 2004, Mississippi was the only majority-black Democratic electorate in the south, and indeed the US.

The study did not contain data from the fifth state, Louisiana, but it\u2019s likely black Americans made up a majority of Democratic voters there too.</p> <p>McKee and Burley both say black women especially hold the key to the south. McKee points to the fact that black women are disproportionately likely to vote.</p> <p>Burley adds: \u201cWomen, particularly black women, are able to influence the men in their lives and the people that they\u2019re surrounded by. What I saw on Hillary\u2019s campaign is that you had little old ladies making sure that their grandsons and their brothers and their husbands were going to the polls with them.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We are extremely strategic\u2019</h2> <p>This time around, Sanders is likely trying to gauge whether he can hit the reset button with black voters after his inability to woo them became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/09/bernie-sanders-black-democratic-vote\">a dominant narrative</a> of 2016. As Syreeta McFadden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/09/bernie-sanders-black-democratic-vote\">wrote in the Guardian</a>, the prevailing wisdom was that the disconnect was emblematic of a history in which \u201cthe white left in America has often asked black America to subordinate the fight against racism for a collective struggle against class divisions\u201d.</p> <p>Theodore Johnson, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice who studies black voting behavior, said Sanders still faces an uphill climb.</p> <p>\u201cI think people know who Bernie is, especially in South Carolina,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that he\u2019s going to outperform what he did four years ago.\u201d</p> <p>For Johnson, both messenger and message hamstring the Vermont senator with black voters.

      "bodyText": "Likely presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker will be in South Carolina on Monday, marking the Martin Luther King holiday at competing events in the first southern state to hold a primary in 2020. Booker will speak at a rally at the statehouse; Sanders is hosting a town hall in Columbia. Ostensibly, the politicians are on hand to celebrate the life and work of the civil rights leader. But for both, this is an opportunity to speak candidly about race to black voters who will play a gigantic role in selecting the Democratic nominee. \u201cThe Democratic nomination runs through the south,\u201d said Seth McKee, a political scientist at Texas Tech University. For Democrats, \u201cthe south\u201d has rapidly come to mean one thing more than anything else: the black vote. Black Americans now make up about 60% of Democratic voters in South Carolina. \u201cWhen southern black voters unite behind a Democratic candidate, the South becomes a formidable firewall that is hard to overcome for any candidate who performs poorly among this group,\u201d McKee wrote in a study of the 2016 election. How such votes are best earned remains up for debate. Speaking clearly and forcefully about civil rights on big stages is certainly part of the equation. But so is how black voters perceive a candidate\u2019s electability, and a knack for retail politics. \u201cAny candidate who wants to appeal to black voters is going to have to put real money into engagement, spend time meeting with organizations that represent their interests, listening to them, and allowing that feedback to actually impact their policy platform,\u201d said Jamira Burley, an engagement strategist for Hillary Clinton in 2016. That, she said, was a big part of why Clinton performed so well with black voters, beating Sanders by a whopping 47 points in South Carolina and racking up similar victories throughout the south, even as Sanders took several unexpected wins in the midwest. Throughout the contest, many commentators saw the south as Clinton\u2019s own \u201cfirewall\u201d. In 2004, Mississippi was the only majority-black Democratic electorate in the south, and indeed the US. But as southern whites have continued their generations-long exodus from the party, the Democratic vote has become majority black through huge pockets of the region. In four of the five \u201cdeep south\u201d states \u2013 Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina \u2013 black voters cast a majority of Democratic votes in 2016, according to McKee. The study did not contain data from the fifth state, Louisiana, but it\u2019s likely black Americans made up a majority of Democratic voters there too. McKee and Burley both say black women especially hold the key to the south. McKee points to the fact that black women are disproportionately likely to vote. Burley adds: \u201cWomen, particularly black women, are able to influence the men in their lives and the people that they\u2019re surrounded by. What I saw on Hillary\u2019s campaign is that you had little old ladies making sure that their grandsons and their brothers and their husbands were going to the polls with them.\u201d \u2018We are extremely strategic\u2019 This time around, Sanders is likely trying to gauge whether he can hit the reset button with black voters after his inability to woo them became a dominant narrative of 2016. As Syreeta McFadden wrote in the Guardian, the prevailing wisdom was that the disconnect was emblematic of a history in which \u201cthe white left in America has often asked black America to subordinate the fight against racism for a collective struggle against class divisions\u201d. Theodore Johnson, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice who studies black voting behavior, said Sanders still faces an uphill climb. \u201cI think people know who Bernie is, especially in South Carolina,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that he\u2019s going to outperform what he did four years ago.\u201d For Johnson, both messenger and message hamstring the Vermont senator with black voters. The problem may be, in part, that Sanders\u2019 platform is too progressive. Black voters tend to hold more conservative views than white progressives in the Democratic party, especially in the south. Johnson said: \u201cIf the thinking is, for white candidates in particular, \u2018The further left I go, the more black voters we\u2019ll win?\u2019 That\u2019s bad thinking and they need to fire their black outreach person and start over.\u201d Black voters also tend to be more pragmatic about what kind of candidates and policies have a realistic chance of winning an election or passing into law, and are more inclined to go with the safe bet. Johnson points to the fact that in 2008 Clinton actually outpolled Barack Obama with southern black voters until he won in the Iowa caucus, demonstrating his candidacy wasn\u2019t a mere liberal fantasy. Obama has cleared that hurdle \u2013 the apparent impossibility of a black presidency \u2013 from Booker\u2019s path. But neither the New Jersey senator nor California senator Kamala Harris, who is expected to announce her own run on Monday, can expect to monopolize the southern black electorate based on identity alone. \u201cDon\u2019t take it for a fact that black voters are going to blindly vote for another black person just because they\u2019re black,\u201d said Burley. \u201cWe are extremely strategic. We we want to elect someone who actually cares about our population and our communities beyond just reflecting our own identity.\u201d According to McKee, Booker and Harris may also face skepticism from southern blacks over their coastal zip codes. \u201cThey\u2019re not southern and they don\u2019t have any connection to the south, so maybe there\u2019s an inroad for [Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke] because of that,\u201d McKee said. \u201cBut then again, if Booker and Harris can connect culturally, if not regionally, then they have a really good chance, especially with a majority black or deep south electorate.\u201d Other announced or contemplating presidential contenders will also attend MLK day events, including former vice-president Joe Biden, who will speak at the National Action Network\u2019s annual King breakfast in Washington with founder Rev Al Sharpton and Martin Luther King III.

      "body": "<p>Glenn Close picks up the phone in her Montana home and all hell breaks loose. Between waves of helpless laughter, she tries to explain exactly what is causing the chaos. \u201cSorry to be \u2013 can you hear me? \u2013 oh my God \u2013there\u2019s a dog going past the house and \u2013 wait there.\u201d The pooch making all that racket is Pip, Close\u2019s pet havanese. He only recently watched one of her films, she tells me; fittingly enough, it was the live-action version of 101 Dalmatians, in which she is a regally evil and blazingly camp Cruella de Vil in black-and-white fright wig and taloned gloves. \u201cHe was absolutely glued to the screen,\u201d she says. Possibly in terror at her puppy-killing plans. Pip has his own Instagram account (he\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sirpippinofbeanfield/\">Sir Pippin of Beanfield</a>). \u201cEveryone knows about him, so I\u2019ll have to start posting more things on there,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Now may not be the time. Over the next five weeks, the 71-year-old actor will have numerous awards ceremonies to attend \u2013 including the Baftas on 10 February and the Academy Awards a fortnight later \u2013 and in all likelihood more statuettes to collect in honour of her performance in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/12/the-wife-review-glenn-close-brilliant-toronto-film-festival-tiff-2017\">The Wife</a> as Joan Castleman, the overlooked spouse of a Nobel-winning novelist, played by Jonathan Pryce. Since its premiere nearly 18 months ago, the film has been seducing audiences and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/30/the-wife-review-glenn-close-class-of-her-own\">critics everywhere</a>, with the Oscar buzz for Close building to a deafening volume. A few weeks ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/07/golden-globes\">she won a Golden Globe</a>; her pop-eyed, gobsmacked expression when her name was read out, followed by an eloquent speech in which she paid tribute to her late mother (\u201cwho really sublimated herself to my father her whole life\u201d) and urged women \u201cto find personal fulfilment\u201d, has won her new legions of fans.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F64S5y6nwyQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F64S5y6nwyQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch Glenn Close\u2019s acceptance speech at the 2019 Golden Globes</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been floored by the response,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are coming up to me in airports to talk about my speech. It\u2019s almost like I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll say if I win again. It\u2019ll be hard to top. It was such a spontaneous moment for me, and that kind of thing you can\u2019t really repeat.\u201d Close, who has been married three times, denies that her mother was a direct inspiration for her portrayal of Joan. \u201cI didn\u2019t channel her. Although of course I had seen her taking the back seat to my father my whole life, so it was in my DNA. I had a well of subliminal experience to draw on.\u201d Her speech delivered the right sentiments at the right time. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they hadn\u2019t been expressed before, but I guess they resonate in this moment. For that whole generation, pre-feminism, that\u2019s the way it was. That was the norm. It\u2019s caused me to look back at my two grandmothers, who were basically unfulfilled women. One had this beautiful singing voice and she wasn\u2019t allowed to pursue that. My other grandmother, whose wedding ring I\u2019m wearing throughout this awards season, dreamed of being an actress.\u201d</p> <p>It was the latter grandparent who inspired Close\u2019s first screen performance, back in 1982, in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084917/\">The World According to Garp</a>; she played Robin Williams\u2019s pioneering feminist mother, though she was in fact only four years older than him.</p> <p>She came to film relatively late, although not for want of trying. She was 35, with an acclaimed stage career to her name, when she was cast in Garp. So while audiences have seen her grow on screen, they never got to see her grow up: her talent arrived fully formed. \u201cWho is this actress who has virtually sneaked up on us?\u201d asked a profile in New York magazine in 1982. By that time, Close already had a Tony nomination, for the musical Barnum, and an Obie award for playing a Victorian woman who lives as a man in The Singular Life of Albert Nobbs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/05/glenn-close-albert-nobbs\">a project she clung to for another 30 years</a>, eventually starring in the 2011 film version. (She is demonstrably tenacious: The Wife took 14 years to reach the screen, and she was attached for the last five of those.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"979e475c64516021423973c1b80c9683b56dd11e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/979e475c64516021423973c1b80c9683b56dd11e/0_42_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Jonathan Pryce in The Wife\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Jonathan Pryce in The Wife, which is hotly tipped to win her an Oscar in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Hunter/Allstar/Sony Picture Classics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Close is unusual for another reason: she got three Oscar nominations in her first three years working in film. After Garp, she was in contention for the baby-boomer comedy <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085244/\">The Big Chill</a> and again for the risible baseball drama <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087781/\">The Natural</a>. This means that she and the Academy Awards have been inextricably linked since the beginning of her screen career. Add a further three nominations \u2013 for playing a spurned lover who turns violent in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093010/\">Fatal Attraction</a>, a scheming noblewoman in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094947/\">Dangerous Liaisons</a> and poor, whimpering Albert Nobbs \u2013 and she is closing in on Richard Burton (seven) and Peter O\u2019Toole (eight) for the most acting nods without a win. It is starting to look like a severe case of nominative determinism: Close but no cigar \u2026</p> <p>The Oscar nominations aren\u2019t announced until tomorrow, although there would be a recount to rival Florida 2000 if Close\u2019s name is not in the best actress category. And although she will face stiff competition, chiefly from Olivia Colman, a co-favourite for The Favourite, there is in The Wife a convergence of encouraging factors. It is a timely subject and a rich, expertly layered performance. Also, it\u2019s about time.</p> <p>Would it be unseemly to ask what she thinks of her own chances? \u201cOh, I daren\u2019t even go there,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI\u2019ve survived all this time just being at the party, and I\u2019ve loved it. Most people sweat over whether they\u2019ll actually win, but I\u2019ve never felt that. I think I\u2019ll be incredibly nervous when they open the envelope, but only because so many people will be disappointed if I don\u2019t win. A lot of them already think I\u2019ve got an Oscar. If I do lose, I want to look at the camera and reassure everyone: \u2018I\u2019m OK.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Whatever happens on the night, it is unlikely to be as dramatic as her experience in 1988, the year of her Fatal Attraction nomination, when she was so heavily pregnant that she attended the ceremony with her obstetrician and his wife in tow. \u201cI had broken my ankle, too, so I had an ankle brace and a cane,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were late, there was terrible traffic and we had to get out of the limo and run through the parking lot, and I had lost an earring, so someone had to go back and find it.\u201d Her infectiously jubilant laugh rings out. \u201cWhen Michael Douglas and I came out to present an award, everyone started laughing at the fact that I was hugely pregnant, because in Fatal Attraction, of course, I keep telling him: \u2018I\u2019m going to have your baby!\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I long for the day when people say: \u2018This is a fantastic movie,\u2019 rather than: \u2018This is a fantastic women\u2019s movie</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The child she was carrying was her daughter, Annie Starke, who is outstanding as the younger Joan in The Wife. The manner in which Close\u2019s pregnancy was reported back in 1987 was indicative of institutionalised misogyny; the popular press tried to portray her as a home-wrecking floozy who couldn\u2019t distinguish between film and reality. \u201cThe star of Fatal Attraction has virtually recreated her screen persona by getting pregnant and wreaking havoc in her lover\u2019s life!\u201d reported one UK newspaper. She had first met Annie\u2019s father, the film production manager John Starke, on the set of Garp. Although he was in another relationship when she fell pregnant, it was Close, rather than him, who was singled out for censure by the media.</p> <p>Close is hopeful now that the fall of Harvey Weinstein and the rise of the #MeToo movement is putting an end to such attitudes, or at least denying them the oxygen of publicity. \u201cI think the effect of it all will be fascinating to see,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen women have more of a chance, all these great stories are going to come out. And it won\u2019t just be about them. I long for the day when people say: \u2018This is a fantastic movie,\u2019 rather than: \u2018This is a fantastic women\u2019s movie.\u2019 We have to keep the issue of the empowerment of women at the forefront because it\u2019s something that won\u2019t become part of our culture unless a lot of people fight for it.\u201d</p> <p>Close has enjoyed her share of complex, challenging parts. She had a ball as the unapologetically savage lawyer Patty Hewes in the TV drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/may/28/damages-review\">Damages</a>, winning a Golden Globe and two Emmys in the process. Looking back on her career, though, she sees other instances where male perspectives were prioritised. <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100486/\">Reversal of Fortune</a>, in which she played Sunny von B\u00fclow, the heiress whose husband Claus (Jeremy Irons) was charged with her murder before being exonerated, was one such example. \u201cThat was a script written very much from a man\u2019s point of view,\u201d she says now. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t get under Sunny\u2019s skin in that film.\u201d And she has been vocal about the disappointments surrounding Fatal Attraction, from the lack of punishment meted out to the adulterer played by Douglas to the re-shot horror-style climax that transforms Alex, the woman scorned, into an implacable Terminator-like monster. No wonder cinema audiences were baying for Close\u2019s blood, screaming \u201cKill her!\u201d at the screen as they watched.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be5d44f0f002f8739c11eb6bf0b1b078bd0d5ea4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be5d44f0f002f8739c11eb6bf0b1b078bd0d5ea4/0_100_1776_1066/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Close as Alex in 1987\u2019s Fatal Attraction\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Close as Alex in 1987\u2019s Fatal Attraction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI had so many secrets as Alex,\u201d she reflects. \u201cThe woman I was playing was not the same one who was perceived by the public. But I didn\u2019t have the dialogue or the scenes to illuminate her backstory. If you did Fatal Attraction from Alex\u2019s point of view, she would be a tragic person, not a dangerous, evil one.\u201d What a terrific idea, I tell her. Someone should make that version. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually approached Paramount about it,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have other plans at the moment, but I agree it would be fascinating.\u201d For all its toxicity, Fatal Attraction marked a turning point in the perception of Close. She fought hard to play Alex after executives and producers openly doubted that she could be sexy. And she hurled herself into that picture\u2019s big sex scene. Taking place on top of the washing-up, with the tap running, it threw in everything, including the kitchen sink. Close knocked back margaritas hourly while that scene was being shot \u2013 and it took a while.</p> <p>How refreshing to find her sexuality undimmed in The Wife. The opening sex scene between her and Pryce was the first thing they shot. \u201cWe arrived on set in our jammies,\u201d she chuckles. \u201cWe were both thinking the same thing: \u2018We\u2019re pros, we\u2019ve been doing this a long time. Let\u2019s just get down to it.\u2019\u201d It feels revolutionary to see two actors in their 70s having drowsy, vocal, pleasurably filthy sex together. \u201cI know,\u201d she whoops. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the great myths that you lose your sexuality as you get older.

      "bodyText": "Glenn Close picks up the phone in her Montana home and all hell breaks loose. Between waves of helpless laughter, she tries to explain exactly what is causing the chaos. \u201cSorry to be \u2013 can you hear me? \u2013 oh my God \u2013there\u2019s a dog going past the house and \u2013 wait there.\u201d The pooch making all that racket is Pip, Close\u2019s pet havanese. He only recently watched one of her films, she tells me; fittingly enough, it was the live-action version of 101 Dalmatians, in which she is a regally evil and blazingly camp Cruella de Vil in black-and-white fright wig and taloned gloves. \u201cHe was absolutely glued to the screen,\u201d she says. Possibly in terror at her puppy-killing plans. Pip has his own Instagram account (he\u2019s Sir Pippin of Beanfield). \u201cEveryone knows about him, so I\u2019ll have to start posting more things on there,\u201d she says. Now may not be the time. Over the next five weeks, the 71-year-old actor will have numerous awards ceremonies to attend \u2013 including the Baftas on 10 February and the Academy Awards a fortnight later \u2013 and in all likelihood more statuettes to collect in honour of her performance in The Wife as Joan Castleman, the overlooked spouse of a Nobel-winning novelist, played by Jonathan Pryce. Since its premiere nearly 18 months ago, the film has been seducing audiences and critics everywhere, with the Oscar buzz for Close building to a deafening volume. A few weeks ago, she won a Golden Globe; her pop-eyed, gobsmacked expression when her name was read out, followed by an eloquent speech in which she paid tribute to her late mother (\u201cwho really sublimated herself to my father her whole life\u201d) and urged women \u201cto find personal fulfilment\u201d, has won her new legions of fans. \u201cI\u2019ve been floored by the response,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are coming up to me in airports to talk about my speech. It\u2019s almost like I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll say if I win again. It\u2019ll be hard to top. It was such a spontaneous moment for me, and that kind of thing you can\u2019t really repeat.\u201d Close, who has been married three times, denies that her mother was a direct inspiration for her portrayal of Joan. \u201cI didn\u2019t channel her. Although of course I had seen her taking the back seat to my father my whole life, so it was in my DNA. I had a well of subliminal experience to draw on.\u201d Her speech delivered the right sentiments at the right time. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they hadn\u2019t been expressed before, but I guess they resonate in this moment. For that whole generation, pre-feminism, that\u2019s the way it was. That was the norm. It\u2019s caused me to look back at my two grandmothers, who were basically unfulfilled women. One had this beautiful singing voice and she wasn\u2019t allowed to pursue that. My other grandmother, whose wedding ring I\u2019m wearing throughout this awards season, dreamed of being an actress.\u201d It was the latter grandparent who inspired Close\u2019s first screen performance, back in 1982, in The World According to Garp; she played Robin Williams\u2019s pioneering feminist mother, though she was in fact only four years older than him. She came to film relatively late, although not for want of trying. She was 35, with an acclaimed stage career to her name, when she was cast in Garp. So while audiences have seen her grow on screen, they never got to see her grow up: her talent arrived fully formed. \u201cWho is this actress who has virtually sneaked up on us?\u201d asked a profile in New York magazine in 1982. By that time, Close already had a Tony nomination, for the musical Barnum, and an Obie award for playing a Victorian woman who lives as a man in The Singular Life of Albert Nobbs, a project she clung to for another 30 years, eventually starring in the 2011 film version. (She is demonstrably tenacious: The Wife took 14 years to reach the screen, and she was attached for the last five of those.) Close is unusual for another reason: she got three Oscar nominations in her first three years working in film. After Garp, she was in contention for the baby-boomer comedy The Big Chill and again for the risible baseball drama The Natural. This means that she and the Academy Awards have been inextricably linked since the beginning of her screen career. Add a further three nominations \u2013 for playing a spurned lover who turns violent in Fatal Attraction, a scheming noblewoman in Dangerous Liaisons and poor, whimpering Albert Nobbs \u2013 and she is closing in on Richard Burton (seven) and Peter O\u2019Toole (eight) for the most acting nods without a win. It is starting to look like a severe case of nominative determinism: Close but no cigar \u2026 The Oscar nominations aren\u2019t announced until tomorrow, although there would be a recount to rival Florida 2000 if Close\u2019s name is not in the best actress category. And although she will face stiff competition, chiefly from Olivia Colman, a co-favourite for The Favourite, there is in The Wife a convergence of encouraging factors. It is a timely subject and a rich, expertly layered performance. Also, it\u2019s about time. Would it be unseemly to ask what she thinks of her own chances? \u201cOh, I daren\u2019t even go there,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI\u2019ve survived all this time just being at the party, and I\u2019ve loved it. Most people sweat over whether they\u2019ll actually win, but I\u2019ve never felt that. I think I\u2019ll be incredibly nervous when they open the envelope, but only because so many people will be disappointed if I don\u2019t win. A lot of them already think I\u2019ve got an Oscar. If I do lose, I want to look at the camera and reassure everyone: \u2018I\u2019m OK.\u2019\u201d Whatever happens on the night, it is unlikely to be as dramatic as her experience in 1988, the year of her Fatal Attraction nomination, when she was so heavily pregnant that she attended the ceremony with her obstetrician and his wife in tow. \u201cI had broken my ankle, too, so I had an ankle brace and a cane,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were late, there was terrible traffic and we had to get out of the limo and run through the parking lot, and I had lost an earring, so someone had to go back and find it.\u201d Her infectiously jubilant laugh rings out. \u201cWhen Michael Douglas and I came out to present an award, everyone started laughing at the fact that I was hugely pregnant, because in Fatal Attraction, of course, I keep telling him: \u2018I\u2019m going to have your baby!\u2019\u201d The child she was carrying was her daughter, Annie Starke, who is outstanding as the younger Joan in The Wife. The manner in which Close\u2019s pregnancy was reported back in 1987 was indicative of institutionalised misogyny; the popular press tried to portray her as a home-wrecking floozy who couldn\u2019t distinguish between film and reality. \u201cThe star of Fatal Attraction has virtually recreated her screen persona by getting pregnant and wreaking havoc in her lover\u2019s life!\u201d reported one UK newspaper. She had first met Annie\u2019s father, the film production manager John Starke, on the set of Garp. Although he was in another relationship when she fell pregnant, it was Close, rather than him, who was singled out for censure by the media. Close is hopeful now that the fall of Harvey Weinstein and the rise of the #MeToo movement is putting an end to such attitudes, or at least denying them the oxygen of publicity. \u201cI think the effect of it all will be fascinating to see,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen women have more of a chance, all these great stories are going to come out. And it won\u2019t just be about them. I long for the day when people say: \u2018This is a fantastic movie,\u2019 rather than: \u2018This is a fantastic women\u2019s movie.\u2019 We have to keep the issue of the empowerment of women at the forefront because it\u2019s something that won\u2019t become part of our culture unless a lot of people fight for it.\u201d Close has enjoyed her share of complex, challenging parts. She had a ball as the unapologetically savage lawyer Patty Hewes in the TV drama Damages, winning a Golden Globe and two Emmys in the process. Looking back on her career, though, she sees other instances where male perspectives were prioritised. Reversal of Fortune, in which she played Sunny von B\u00fclow, the heiress whose husband Claus (Jeremy Irons) was charged with her murder before being exonerated, was one such example. \u201cThat was a script written very much from a man\u2019s point of view,\u201d she says now. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t get under Sunny\u2019s skin in that film.\u201d And she has been vocal about the disappointments surrounding Fatal Attraction, from the lack of punishment meted out to the adulterer played by Douglas to the re-shot horror-style climax that transforms Alex, the woman scorned, into an implacable Terminator-like monster. No wonder cinema audiences were baying for Close\u2019s blood, screaming \u201cKill her!\u201d at the screen as they watched. \u201cI had so many secrets as Alex,\u201d she reflects. \u201cThe woman I was playing was not the same one who was perceived by the public. But I didn\u2019t have the dialogue or the scenes to illuminate her backstory. If you did Fatal Attraction from Alex\u2019s point of view, she would be a tragic person, not a dangerous, evil one.\u201d What a terrific idea, I tell her. Someone should make that version. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually approached Paramount about it,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have other plans at the moment, but I agree it would be fascinating.\u201d For all its toxicity, Fatal Attraction marked a turning point in the perception of Close. She fought hard to play Alex after executives and producers openly doubted that she could be sexy. And she hurled herself into that picture\u2019s big sex scene. Taking place on top of the washing-up, with the tap running, it threw in everything, including the kitchen sink. Close knocked back margaritas hourly while that scene was being shot \u2013 and it took a while. How refreshing to find her sexuality undimmed in The Wife. The opening sex scene between her and Pryce was the first thing they shot. \u201cWe arrived on set in our jammies,\u201d she chuckles. \u201cWe were both thinking the same thing: \u2018We\u2019re pros, we\u2019ve been doing this a long time. Let\u2019s just get down to it.\u2019\u201d It feels revolutionary to see two actors in their 70s having drowsy, vocal, pleasurably filthy sex together. \u201cI know,\u201d she whoops. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the great myths that you lose your sexuality as you get older. One night last year, I was coming across town from the East Village to the West. It was late on a Friday night and there were a lot of couples on the street. Pippy and I were looking out of the car window and I could feel what all those couples were feeling.\u201d Her voice has dropped to an intimate, tingling whisper. \u201cI could feel their excitement, the sense of intimacy about to happen. It was extremely powerful.\u201d Right now, she believes she is in her prime. \u201cI feel as free and as creative, as sexual and as eager, as I ever have.

      "bodyText": "Simon Wilkinson, a British lorry driver, is surveying about 1,000 lorries amassing at the \u201cqueue for the queue\u201d about half a mile from a French port. \u201cThis is frictionless trade on a Thursday afternoon in Calais,\u201d he said. Wilkinson runs a small haulage company in Kent that specialises in transporting frozen food. Like all hauliers, he is looking ahead to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit \u2013 and the customs and animal checks that could come with it \u2013 with some trepidation. \u201cThis is what it is like before you throw the spanner in the works,\u201d he pointed out. About 15 minutes earlier, Wilkinson took a detour from his pickup point in Belgium to see the site earmarked by France for the new border inspection post, where food and animals coming from the UK will be subjected to mandatory health checks. But at the port\u2019s planned border inspection post, no work has been done. It is an open field off the A16, the main road between Dunkirk and Calais, where there is no hard shoulder but there is evidence of people recently living on verges, where rain-sodden duvets and clothes are compacted into the dirt. As we head to the port of Calais, the scale of the commercial operation unfolds, with lorries grinding to a halt in the \u201cbuffer zone\u201d ahead of the four controls before the ferry. Hard-sided refrigerated lorries are segregated from soft-sided curtain trailers, which range from small lorries carrying goods ordered the night before on Amazon and eBay to 44-tonne vehicles such as Wilkinson\u2019s, which is carrying 24 tonnes of frozen vegetables from Belgium destined for British pubs, restaurants and schools. After one-and-a-half hours snaking through a sea of lorries, we get to the weighbridge \u2013 the first check \u2013 then the \u201cheartbeat machine\u201d, which checks for stowaways, followed by British and French immigration controls, and finally a shipping office to register for the next available ferry. There we will wait a further two-and-a-half hours. That we are queueing up with 11 other lorries in lane 155 \u2013 one of more than 500 lanes \u2013 illustrates how big a pinch point Calais is in the supply chain that keeps Britain\u2019s car plants moving and supermarket shelves full. \u201cI wanted to make it common knowledge how congested Calais already is. It runs smoothly, but sometimes you can wait up to nine hours,\u201d said Wilkinson. \u201cThis is pure luck it only took an hour-and-a-half. A few hours later and it would be gridlock,\u201d added Wilkinson, who runs a fleet of refrigerated lorries from Kent across the Channel every day, then brings food back. For tourists accustomed to rolling on and off cross-Channel ferries, this is another world. \u201cWhen people complain that delays in Dover are going to impact their holiday plans, that\u2019s small beer,\u201d Wilkinson said. \u201cThis is my living 365 days a year.\u201d Wilkinson runs a fleet of 18 lorries at Harrier Express, employing 25 drivers. A day\u2019s delay costs him \u00a3400 per lorry and potentially more if frozen cargo is left to rot at the side of the road. What frustrates and angers him the most is the disconnect between Westminster and hauliers on daily business on the border \u2013 the Brexit frontline. \u201cAt Manston, what on earth were we doing?\u201d asked Wilkinson, referring to the recent government trial at a disused airport in Kent of an emergency traffic system in the event of Brexit gridlock in Dover. \u201cWhat were we doing? We were planning for failure, we are planning for walking off the plank \u2013 and why? We have really serious people like [the bank of England governor] Mark Carney, or Mr BMW or Mr JLR [Jaguar Land Rover], who employ tens of thousands of people, warning the government if you do this [leave the EU without a deal] then our business is going to relocate, but why aren\u2019t they getting the credibility in the debate?\u201d he asked. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, French authorities have warned a two-minute delay at the border could lead to 27,000 vehicles queuing on both sides of the Channel. With so much uncertainty, Wilkinson is making his own contingency plans, and has been trialling a new route from Zeebrugge to Purfleet with \u201cunaccompanied\u201d lorries \u2013 where one driver takes a lorry to the ferry and another drives it off at the other end. But he has discovered it will mean a 20% drop in his daily freight capacity because of the extra time involved. He would also have to set up a company in Belgium to run a fleet of drivers for the \u201cunaccompanied\u201d loads, an action that is far trickier than it is in the UK. \u201cBut I\u2019m hoping that we won\u2019t be sitting on any motorways anywhere, that there will be proper lorry parking with toilets,\u201d he said. Between 6,000 and 10,000 trucks cross the Channel every day, and all checks \u2013 bar those of passports and for fraud and smuggling \u2013 are carried out on the French side because of limited space at the cliff-edged port of Dover. While Brexiters have said Britain can choose to keep checks on goods and food to a minimum, those in the business are sure this will not be the case in the long term. \u201cWe are getting ready for not just day one [of] no deal,\u201d said a French political source. \u201cWe are working on the basis that checks might also be done on food going into Britain eventually, and because there is no space in Dover, that it might be done [on the] French side.\u201d But the best-laid plans could be undone by language issues, with knock-on delays as haulage is now dominated by Polish and Romanian-licensed lorries, with many drivers unable to speak French or English. In time, Wilkinson and his colleagues fear, queues of 1,000 lorries may seem a lot shorter than they do today.",

Among accusations levelled by those interviewed by HRW are that members of the Libyan coastguard, which includes untrained former militia members who fought against former president Muammar Gaddafi, \u201cthreatened to shoot\u201d intercepted migrants who refused to board their boat. According to Joanna, a 34-year-old mother of three from Cameroon, who was on a boat intercepted by the coastguard in international waters: \u201cMen on the large Libyan boat threw us a rope and at first we refused to tie it to ours. The Libyans shot into the air and threatened us: \u2018If you don\u2019t tie it on to the boat then we will shoot at you.\u2019 So we tied it to our boat and they started to move people to their boat.\u201d The US-led group adds that increased legal and bureaucratic obstacles imposed in Europe to block most non-governmental maritime rescue operations in the central Mediterranean has contributed to a rising death toll even as the numbers attempting to reach Europe from Libya have dropped. \u201cWhile Mediterranean departures have decreased since mid-2017, the chances of dying in waters off the coast of Libya significantly increased, from one in 42 in 2017 to one in 18 in 2018,\u201d the group added, citing figures collected by the UN\u2019s refugee agency. The report adds that while the IOM had assisted more than 30,000 people to return from Libya to their home countries through its \u201cvoluntary humanitarian program\u201d, increased interceptions by the EU-supported Libyan coastguard have led to a rise in the number of migrants and asylum seekers detained in Libya to between 8,000 to 10,000 people, up from 5,200 in April 2018. Describing unsanitary conditions and a lack of proper healthcare in the centres visited, researchers also documented repeated claims of serious abuse by the authorities against detainees. Researchers visited detention centres in Tripoli, Misrata and Zuwara where they documented inhumane conditions that included severe overcrowding, unsanitary accommodation, poor-quality food and water that has led to malnutrition, lack of adequate healthcare, and disturbing accounts of violence by guards, including beatings, whippings and use of electric shocks. Judith Sunderland, lead author of the report, told the Guardian: \u201cThere has been a wilful attempt to ignore what is going on. \u201cThere have been some efforts to mitigate the situation and to try to improve conditions in the detention centres, and to improve the capacity and professionalism of the Libyan coastguard. But\u2026 it is past time to accept the fact that these efforts are not bearing fruit. \u201cIt is important to keep in mind that the overarching ambition of this policy is to limit arrivals of migrants to EU shores. The logic is clear and they appear willing to accept a Faustian bargain. But what is needed is a reset to a failed strategy.\u201d",

He points to the fate of another local activist, the environmentalist Andrey Rudomakha, who was set upon by thugs and left with a broken nose and a traumatic brain injury. Rudomakha spent two months recovering in hospital.</p> <p>Knedlyakovsky organised anti-government rallies for the Solidarity movement and was friends with its leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/boris-nemtsov\">Boris Nemtsov</a>, who was shot dead in February 2015 a few hundred metres from the Kremlin.

      "bodyText": "Two Russian opposition activists denied political asylum in Sweden say they fear being arrested and beaten up if they are forced to go home. \u201cYou never know when something will happen,\u201d say Alexey Knedlyakovsky and Lusine Djanyan, who fled their home city of Krasnodar in March 2017 after what they say was a campaign of persecution by the secret police. They flew to Sweden with their two-year-old son and claimed asylum. Last month the country\u2019s migration board turned down their request. It said the couple had provided credible information about the harassment against them but decided they would not be at risk if they were sent home. Knedlyakovsky and Djanyan are appealing the decision. \u201cI don\u2019t want to believe in conspiracy. But this looks like a political decision,\u201d Knedlyakovsky says, speaking from the small Swedish village of Stor\u00e5, three hours north of Stockholm, where they are living. \u201cOur lawyer read the ruling and said: \u2018It\u2019s crazy.\u2019 \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about what will happen if we go back. It\u2019s dangerous. There will be a criminal prosecution for sure. And physical violence against me.\u201d The pair, both artists, have been politically active since 2010. In 2014 Knedlyakovsky and Djanyan took part in a protest with the feminist collective Pussy Riot against the Winter Olympics in Sochi. Knedlyakovsky was the only male participant and wore a dress in solidarity with the LGBT movement. Ultra-nationalist Cossacks attacked the demonstrators with whips. Knedlyakovsky was hit over the head with his own guitar, arrested, pepper-sprayed and led away with blood streaming down his face. Djanyan was manhandled and left with kidney pains. The police also detained Pussy Riot\u2019s Nadya Tolokonnikova and Masha Alyokhina, both of whom were previously imprisoned for a punk performance in Christ the Saviour Cathedral in Moscow. In 2016 Knedlyakovsky staged another protest by attaching a wooden cross to a statue in Krasnodar of Felix Dzerzhinsky, who founded the Cheka, a forerunner of the KGB, now known as the Federal Security Service (FSB). Vladimir Putin is a former head of the FSB. Knedlyakovsky says he was protesting against the merger under Putin of Russian state ideology and Orthodox Christianity. The stunt appears to have annoyed the local FSB chief; Knedlyakovsky was arrested and spent 15 days in jail, locked up in a windowless basement cell. Tolokonnikova described Sweden\u2019s decision as \u201cinhuman\u201d. She said the board underestimated the genuine threat to life facing opposition figures in Russia. \u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate message, both to activists here and in other authoritarian countries. It says: \u2018If you are in danger, nobody will help you.\u2019\u201d Before they escaped to Sweden, the couple were harassed on multiple occasions, Knedlyakovsky says. In 2013 Djanyan was fired from her job at a Krasnodar university for her political activities and was subsequently unable to exhibit her art in galleries and museums. At one point, when Djanyan was pregnant, a man in a cafe attacked her and accused her of \u201chating Putin\u201d. On another occasion a woman struck her in a park. Unknown men turned up at the couple\u2019s flat and warned Knedlyakovsky if he did not desist from politics he would be grievously punished. The activist says the threat was real. He points to the fate of another local activist, the environmentalist Andrey Rudomakha, who was set upon by thugs and left with a broken nose and a traumatic brain injury. Rudomakha spent two months recovering in hospital. Knedlyakovsky organised anti-government rallies for the Solidarity movement and was friends with its leader Boris Nemtsov, who was shot dead in February 2015 a few hundred metres from the Kremlin. Nemtsov\u2019s posthumous foundation paid for the family\u2019s tickets to Sweden. Meanwhile, the Pussy Riot member Pyotr Verzilov \u2013 Tolokonnikova\u2019s former husband \u2013 was poisoned in Moscow last September. He fell ill soon after appearing in court with other members of Pussy Riot following a pitch invasion at last summer\u2019s World Cup final. Verzilov is currently living outside of Russia. Knedlyakovsky says conditions in Sweden are good. The couple have two children \u2013 Tigran, five, and Levon, who was born last summer. The village has a library, a kindergarten and a lake. They are able to make art and \u201ccan do something\u201d, he says, unlike less fortunate fellow refugees from Afghanistan and Iraq whose situation he calls \u201cterrible\u201d. Sweden\u2019s migration board said it did not comment on individual cases. Its ruling says the \u201capplicants\u201d will be expelled. They can either travel to Russia or to another country willing to take them. They must leave Sweden no less than four weeks after the decision becomes final and non-appealable. The ongoing appeal process is likely to last several months. The board considered letters of support for the family from four human rights organisations, including Memorial, Russia\u2019s foremost civil rights society. The individuals who harassed him and his wife were sent by the Russian state, Knedlyakovsky says, which Swedish authorities appear not to have grasped. \u201cIf we return they [the FSB] will do something,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t go back. We are optimists. We will try and find a way to live in Sweden or to move to another country.\u201d",

Mahomes had a successful postseason debut against the Indianapolis Colts, but he didn\u2019t have a passing touchdown (although he did rush for one). That didn\u2019t really matter in a comfortable 31-13 win, but that\u2019s not going to cut it against Tom Brady and the Patriots. Every drive in which the Patriots defense can limit the Chiefs to a field goal (or less) will be crucial if this becomes a shootout similar to the teams\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/15/patriots-edge-chiefs-in-thriller-as-brady-outduels-mahomes-for-now\">previous meeting</a>.</p> <p><strong>What the Chiefs need to do</strong>: Watch the clock. The Chiefs\u2019 Andy Reid is one of the best head coaches in the league, but he\u2019s also notorious for his <a href=\"https://www.si.com/nfl/2016/09/05/nfl-clock-management-andy-reid-homer-smith\">poor clock management</a> in big games. If Sunday\u2019s meeting ends up being close down the stretch, both teams must use their timeouts wisely and have perfect awareness of how much time is left (or at least glance at the clock on occasion).</p> <p><strong>Key player for the Patriots</strong>: <strong>Julian Edelman, WR</strong>. There are plenty of benefits to being Tom Brady\u2019s favorite target and that includes climbing up the Most Postseason Receptions list. With his 94<sup>th</sup> postseason reception last Sunday, Edelman moved up to second on the list, passing Reggie Wayne, and he ended the 41-28 blowout with 98. It\u2019s safe to bet that he won\u2019t beat Jerry Rice\u2019s record of 151 but he\u2019s probably a good bet to break the 100 mark this Sunday.</p> <p><strong>Key player for the Chiefs</strong>: <strong>Damien Williams, RB</strong>. You think the Patriots regret <a href=\"https://nesn.com/2019/01/patriots-considered-signing-chiefs-breakout-running-back-last-offseason/\">not signing Williams</a>? Kansas City\u2019s running game could have taken a stumble when they cut Kareem Hunt. Instead they inserted Williams who has thrived in their system. He is coming off a 129-yard performance against the Colts.</p> <p><strong>Unheralded player to watch</strong>: <strong>Cordarrelle Patterson, KR, New England Patriots</strong>. Patterson is technically a wide receiver, but the Patriots used him as a running back during the regular season when Sony Michel was unavailable. Now that Michel is healthy, as his <a href=\"https://www.si.com/nfl/2019/01/13/new-england-patriots-power-run-game-sony-michel-dangerous\">mammoth game</a> against the Chargers established, Patterson\u2019s biggest impact will be as a kick returner. In fact, Los Angeles brought in a second kicker, Nick Rose, to handle kickoffs and limit Patterson\u2019s chances (he would end up returning just one kick, for 23 yards). In a game that may well come down to the wire, one huge return could end up being key.</p> <p><strong>Prediction</strong>: Patriots 31-34 Chiefs</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Game report And last but not least, read all about this instant classic right here. This game had just about everything, but in the end, it was almost predictable. Bill Belichick and Tom Brady heading to the Super Bowl for a ninth time. Considering the way they were dominated in the second half, Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs launched what seemed to be an almost improbable comeback, but in the overtime, New England and Brady took over and the kid never got the ball. There\u2019s good reason to believe that he\u2019ll reach this stage for years to come, but for now, he yields to the old raisin who has one more crack at a title. We\u2019ll have coverage of this game and all the Super Bowl trimmings soon enough, but for now, thanks for reading, and food night. Burkhead is in the endzone and New England are heading to the Super Bowl for the third straight year! Don\u2019t pass the torch yet, Tom Brady has reached the big show one more time! It\u2019s New England v Los Angeles in Atlanta in two weeks time! Patriots 31-31 Chiefs, 10:16 overtime Now Burkhead barrels ahead down to the five! The game is in the balance for KC! Burkhead has it again, he\u2019s down to the two. It\u2019s 2nd &amp; goal! Patriots 31-31 Chiefs, 11:33 overtime Brady looks for Patterson, incomplete. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 10. Does that mean Edelman again? No, it\u2019s Gronkowski, who has a reception at the 15! First down! Patriots 31-31 Chiefs, 12:03 overtime Flea flicker! Razzle dazzle! Brady goes endzone...incomplete! 2nd &amp; 10 from the 30... Patriots 31-31 Chiefs, 12:07 overtime Streaking into the middle of the field, Patterson can\u2019t grab a ball thrown slightly behind him, incomplete. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 10 and now Brady hooks up with Edelman again for 15! Ball is at the KC 30. TD wins the game. Patriots 31-31 Chiefs, 13:02 overtime Brady finds Edelman at midfield, Edelman is pummeled to the ground and holds on! First down and NE keep their drive alive. Patriots 31-31 Chiefs, 13:40 overtime Hogan has a 10-yard reception on the left side before Burkhead runs into the line for a yard. Now it is 2nd &amp; 9 and the NE 36. Brady steps up to avoid the pressure but fires near side, incomplete. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 9. We will continue playing until we have a winner. Both teams get a possession unless the first team scores a touchdown: in that case the game is over. Each team gets three timeouts. New England win the toss, they\u2019ll take the ball. Here we go! Correction: We had a tech hitch with the score: please refresh your browser to see the changes. And so for the second time today, a championship game will go to overtime as Butker\u2019s kick splits the uprights. Name your superlative for this game folks, none of the will be good enough. Patriots 31-28 Chiefs, 0:11 4th quarter Mahomes throws it away. Here comes the field goal unit. It will be a 39 yard attempt for Butker to tie this up. Patriots 31-28 Chiefs, 0:16 4th quarter Mahomes hits Robinson deep in NE territory, and a neutral zone flag on the Pats stops the clock. The refs are talking about the clock accuracy, but that gives KC time to figure out their next move. Meanwhile, The Chiefs are on the NE 21 and can take a shot at the endzone. Patriots 31-28 Chiefs, 0:23 4th quarter Mahomes buys all kinds of time, but time isn\u2019t something the Chiefs have. Tremendous athletic play from Mahomes, who finds Ware across the 50. Timeout KC. Patriots 31-28 Chiefs, 00:32 4th quarter Smith\u2019s return is at the 30. KC have one timeout to help the Chiefs get into field position. After a big catch by Gronkowski takes NE to the three, then Burkhead rolls ahead into the endzone! Brady has done it again! The pass deflects off Gronkowski and is picked off! Except there\u2019s offsides on KC called. So now it\u2019s 3rd and 5! So it\u2019s 3rd and 10 at the 34 and NE keep a timeout: they have two now. The clock is reset to 1:01. Brady goes to Hogan again on the far sideline for a 14 yard gain. New England call their first timeout. The ball is at the KC 21. Or is it? Did Hogan have the ball as he hit the ground? I don\u2019t think that will stick. Patriots 24-28 Chiefs, 1:05 4th quarter Brady finds Hogan for another first down. NE are at the KC 34. Bill Belichick The Patriots head coach just threw his tablet on the ground and then over the bench. It seems that he is a little upset about that pick play that helped KC take the lead. New England start at their 35. It\u2019s in Brady\u2019s hands and he starts with a dart to Edelman for a gain that takes the Pats into KC territory. Williams up the middle, and the running back has his third TD of the quarter! The Chiefs are back on top as the kid passes the gut check in a major way, leading his team down the field to reclaim the lead! Patriots 24-21 Chiefs, 2:04 4th quarter Now Mahomes has Watkins, he\u2019s open thanks to a pick that isn\u2019t called! Watkins is down at the three yard line, first and goal! Patriots 24-21 Chiefs, 3:02 4th quarter Now Mahomes is going deep down the far sideline, incomplete, but we have a flag... ...or flags. Roughing the passer, which is declined, and a pass interference call on Jackson, which is the big one! It puts KC on the NE 40. First down! Three big calls on Jackson down the stretch here. Patriots 24-21 Chiefs, 3:11 4th quarter Mahomes drops back and throws to nobody: Kelce was closest, but there was a miscommunication there. No time for that folks. It\u2019s big boy pants time. Patriots 24-21 Chiefs, 3:11 4th quarter Mahomes finds Kelce, who drops it and NE pick it up...but there is a defensive holding call against Jackson that voids the whole play and pushes KC up to their 37. Still a ways to go. New England have all three timeouts, KC have two, FYI... Patriots 24-21 Chiefs, 3:21 4th quarter Smith takes the kickoff across the 30 and here we go! Can the kid make like the king and cap the second half comeback for KC? Mahomes rolls right and throws incomplete on first down. Brady kills the play at the line, takes the nap, hands to Michel, who steams ahead in between the tackles and into the endzone! New England are back on top! Patriots 17-21 Chiefs, 3:50 4th quarter 3rd &amp; 1. Burkhead has it and is tripped up short of the first down! A measuring says they\u2019re inches short. NE are going, of course. Here we go...can KC stop them again on fourth down? Patriots 17-21 Chiefs, 4:05 4th quarter The clock is ticking. It\u2019s 2nd &amp; 7. Brady is complete to Burkhead on the far sideline, he\u2019s about a yard short of the first down at the 13. Patriots 17-21 Chiefs, 4:49 4th quarter Burkhead runs left and he\u2019s untouched through acres of space for a gain of 14. Now Grownkowski has a first down catch on the far side, Pats have 10 more yards: New England are driving and on the KC 19. NE have their first down confirmed, much to the chagrin of the KC crowd. Pats on the Chiefs 44. Brady, tons of time, and he slings it to Hogan for a great first down catch...or was it! Reid throws a challenge flag. The ruling on the field was complete but the ball is moving as he hits the ground. It looks like a catch to me but it\u2019s really close, just like this game. If it stands NE are in KC territory. Patriots 17-21 Chiefs, 6:25 4th quarter Brady facing pressure again and he throws incomplete...but there\u2019s a roughing the passing call that wasn\u2019t immediately evident, and that\u2019s because I am not sure it actually happened. Oh well, that\u2019s 15 yards and cancels out a 3rd &amp; 7 and turns it into a first down. Thats what we call a break. Now Brady is looking for Gronk who is getting destroyed down the sideline but no flags! That\u2019s a makeup call right there. Big 3rd &amp; 8 coming up. Patriots 17-21 Chiefs, 7:24 4th quarter There\u2019s a Chiefs fan on the field but sadly we don\u2019t get to see it. Luckily there\u2019s been a decent chunk of action here in the second half, don\u2019t you think? A security guard sneaks into the shot: he or she must be giving the men in black trouble... Here comes the blitz again and Mahomes floats a pass to Williams on the near side, he has the football and he is STREAKING DOWN THE SIDELINE! TD KC! The Kansas City Chiefs have come all the way back from a demoralizing first half, 14 points down at halftime, to take a late lead at Arrowhead! But wait, there\u2019s more! Brady is picked off! The pass bounced off Edelman and into the hands of Daniel Sorensen! So now KC take over on the Pats 23!. If you\u2019re a Chiefs fan, that\u2019s justice. Here\u2019s the verdict: Edelman did NOT touch the ball, that means New England have it after KC downed it. I have no idea how there\u2019s enough evidence to overturn the ruling on the field, but that was a tough replay to figure out. So it\u2019s 1st &amp; 10 and NE start on their 28, approaching eight minutes to play. That is a crazy moment in a bizarre game that is becoming crazier by the moment. Edelman fields the punt, but the ball bounces in front of him. Now Gehrig Dieter of KC is running into the endzone! Did Edelman touch the ball? The ruling on the field is that Edelman did touch the ball, and that it can\u2019t be advanced by KC and that the Chiefs have the ball deep in Pats territory. Stand by. Patriots 17-14 Chiefs, 8:40 4th quarter Mahomes in the shotgun, New England send everybody, and the pivot throws it away. So after all the emotion of KC holding on 4th and inches, they fail to do anything with the opportunity and will punt. Patriots 17-14 Chiefs, 8:51 4th quarter Well, after all this, KC have the momentum and the ball. Quickly however, it\u2019s 3rd &amp; 8 after Mahomes fires high over the hands of Williams. Patriots 17-14 Chiefs, 9:33 4th quarter Huge play, here we go. Brady under center, he hands to Burkhead who leaps and is STUFFED BY KC FOR A LOSS! That means the Chiefs take over on downs with a chance to take the lead! Mahomes will get to work from his own 25! Patriots 17-14 Chiefs, 9:47 4th quarter Here\u2019s a big 3rd &amp; 2 and the crowd is up at Arrowhead. Brady is in the shotgun, he hands to White who runs right and is a half-yard short. They\u2019re at the KC 24 and New England are going for it on 4th and inches! Patriots 17-14 Chiefs, 11:36 4th quarter Brady is rushed but he hits the fullback after a lightning quick release. That\u2019s Devlin for nine yards as the clock ticks... Patriots 17-14 Chiefs, 12:36 4th quarter Michel is running again, and once more he has room up the middle. He runs for nine for a first down. KC has to close that out immediately. Michel is approaching 100 yards rushing on the day. Patriots 17-14 Chiefs, 13:35 4th quarter So here comes Tom Brady, bidding to reach his 42nd Super Bowl, looking to hold off this second half rush from Kansas City. He starts off by finding a wide open Edelman over the middle for a healthy gain of 19, up to the Pats 43. Mahomes is rolling to his right and lets it go, right into the chest of Damien Williams in the corner of the endzone. Touchdown! It\u2019s a three point game at Arrowhead! KC have upped their second half yardage production from 3o odd to 145. Patriots 17-7 Chiefs, 14:56 4th quarter Mahomes floats a ball towards Kelce but Jackson hits him too early and flags fly! It\u2019ll be first and goal from the one for KC! Patriots 17-7 Chiefs, end of 3rd quarter Now Mahomes drops back and throws to his right to Williams who has room and is running downhill! Williams spins down inside the 20 and the quarter comes to a close. There\u2019s one quarter between one of these teams and Super Bowl LIII! Patriots 17-7 Chiefs, 0:57 3rd quarter On 3rd &amp; 3, Mahomes is crushed, but not before slinging it sidearm to Watkins who has it for a first down! Patriots 17-7 Chiefs, 1:22 3rd quarter Mahomes is facing a blitz on 2nd down runs it himself, taking a hit on a nine-yard scramble up the middle after electing not to dive. Then the QB sneaks it for a yard for a first down. The somewhat muted crowd don\u2019t really believe in this, it seems. But it\u2019s still a. close game, sort of. Gostkowski drills it into the back of the net, and we\u2019re back to a two-score game. That 12-yard loss on the Hill punt return was such a killer. Patriots 14-7 Chiefs, 4:19 3rd quarter White runs up the middle to the KC 30 on a draw play. It will be a 48-yard attempt by Stephen Gostkowski. Patriots 14-7 Chiefs, 4:38 3rd quarter Michel on first down, runs right, with little to no room for a gain of two. Now Brady is in the shotgun and tosses it over to White out of the backfield, complete. There\u2019s a flag for pass interference on the offense, Dorsett set a pick. So now NE are on the KC 33, so that\u2019s a big penalty, or it could be a big penalty if the kicking game comes into play. On 2nd and 19, NE have a gain of two. Big 3rd &amp; 17 coming up. Patriots 14-7 Chiefs, 6:38 3rd quarter Now New England have a chance to keep the ball on the ground, kill some clock and get three points at least. But Brady goes to the air, complete on the near sideline to Hogan for a first down at the KC 28! Here come New England. Patriots 14-7 Chiefs, 7:38 3rd quarter Mahomes is sacked! That\u2019s a pressure and coverage takedown. So it\u2019s 3rd &amp; 18: Mahomes faces heat again and fires over the middle, incomplete towards Conley. KC have to punt. That overall sequence, starting with the reverse punt return was mostly mess. Now Brady and his Pats will start on the KC 37. Starting on the precipice of field goal range is generally considered to be a positive. Patriots 14-7 Chiefs, 9:05 3rd quarter Play fake and a handoff to Williams who has room and plows up towards a first down. It\u2019s their biggest run of the night: 10 yards. This is an odd game, isn\u2019t it? Chiefs are done for holding, it\u2019s 1st &amp; 15 from the KC 16. Patriots 14-7 Chiefs, 10:33 3rd quarter On 3rd &amp; 6, Brady\u2019s pass is batted down in the line by Chris Jones and the Pats have to punt! Now Hill has it for KC and is running the wrong way: it\u2019s a loss of 12 on the runback! How is that for quashing momentum! But wait, there\u2019s more: there\u2019s also a penalty for an illegal block in the back that sets them back even farther! KC will start at their own five yard line. What the... Patriots 14-7 Chiefs, 11:13 3rd quarter Burkhead struggles but has just enough, pushing for a first down. So the Pats drive continues. Patriots 14-7 Chiefs, 11:56 3rd quarter OK, so maybe I went a little far with the Super Bowl line predictions. Now, let\u2019s see how New England try to settle things down. Well, to start, there\u2019s a six-yard reception on the far side to Burkhead. Now Brady has Edleman, again on the far side, short of a first down by about a yard. Big 3rd &amp; 1 coming up. As it happened Mahomes finds Kelce streaking across the middle and just like that, KC are right back in it! That\u2019s quite a change! Patriots 14-0 Chiefs, 14:27 3rd quarter It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 2 as Andy Reid tries to avoid yet another bone crushing playoff loss. Mahomes is in the shotgun. He has time, lots of it. He runs right and lofts a long, high pass that is COMPLETE! Now that\u2019s a big play! Watkins has a 54-yard reception! KC need to make plays. Big plays. And a lot of them. They start on their 26. When will this ever end? Stats CBS TV here in the US provided us with this nugget before the half ended. Here\u2019s NE in the first half of their two playoff games thus-far: They\u2019re up 592 yards to 175, on first downs 40 to 9 and by points 49 to 7. Should we start setting Super Bowl lines yet? I\u2019ll guess New England gives the Rams four, maybe 4.5 points. Meanwhile, the Pats have outrun KC 99 to 10. Brady has 146 yards and a TD on 12/17 passing. Mahomes is 4/8 for 65 yards. And last but not least, New England have had the ball for 21:03. KC, just 8:53. Email Christopher Lee is back, and a bit perturbed. \u201cThat was a depressingly good half from the bloody Patriots. They\u2019re flaming well gonna win aren\u2019t they?\u201d I\u2019m going to let the rest of you ponder that question. And that will do it for the first half, one thoroughly dominated by an old guy who is clearly finished. This may sound ridiculous, but even after that thrashing, KC are down just two scores and it\u2019s still poss...well, ok, maybe that does sound ridiculous. Brady, has time and is throwing deep down the far sideline into the endzone... ...Phillip Dorsett is being manhandled by Steven Nelson but comes up with the football and has a touchdown! It\u2019s a 90-yard drive in eight plays and the Patriots have demoralized the Chiefs to end the first half. Patriots 7-0 Chiefs, 0:31 2nd quarter They can\u2019t stop the run. White runs left now as Brady changes the play at the line of scrimmage, again. It\u2019s a gain of nine yards to the Chiefs 29 and the Pats use their second timeout. Patriots 7-0 Chiefs, 0:41 2nd quarter Here\u2019s a screen to White on the near side line and he has room - ACRES OF ROOM! Where is everybody? That\u2019s a 30-yard gain that silences the crowd and puts the Pats near field goal territory! Now the Pats will call for time as they set up for a new set of downs starting at the Chiefs 38! Patriots 7-0 Chiefs, 1:13 2nd quarter New England have little interest in stopping this clock. A play fake to Edelman and a toss to Michel goes for a yard. Now Michel carries again for five yards. It\u2019s going to be 3rd &amp; 4, and it\u2019s the Chiefs that call for time. KC\u2019s crowd are doing their best to energize the weathered defense, but New England\u2019s running game is finding holes: Michel is at it again, finding gaping holes. It\u2019s a nine-yard run for a first down and that takes us to the warning. Both teams have all of their timeouts, in case you were wondering. Patriots 7-0 Chiefs, 3:08 2nd quarter It\u2019s 3rd and long for KC: Mahomes facing inside pressure and he\u2019s wrapped up and sacked by Flowers! That\u2019s a loss of 14 yards and the play pushes the Chiefs out of field goal range. So that promising 42-yard play comes to nothing as the Chiefs have to punt. Edelman calls for a fair catch at the 10 and another opportunity is lost for the offense, putting an already tired defense under more pressure to keep their team in the game. Patriots 7-0 Chiefs, 4:10 2nd quarter Mahomes throws deep to Hill who beats double coverage who has it! It\u2019s a 42-yard huge play for Mahomes and KC, somehow down just seven in this game, are now on the NE 23. Patriots 7-0 Chiefs, 6:39 2nd quarter Big 3rd &amp; 2 for KC as their offense tries to get on track. On their 11th play from scrimmage, Mahomes is in the shotgun, drops back, runs right, is nearly sacked by Van Noy, then fires complete! Watkins has a first down to keep the drive going. Email Thomas Wahl writes: \u201cI\u2019m in Colorado rooting for Brady. Well, I am now after seeing the other old guy QB get robbed by such a blatant non-call. So, I\u2019ll root for the other old guy who is still in the hunt.\u201d Some sympathy for Brady outside of New England! The Brady doing it for the old folks (like me) line is alive! Patriots 7-0 Chiefs, 7:39 2nd quarter On 2nd &amp; 10, Brady fakes a throw to Patterson then hands to Michel who runs right up the middle for a gain of nine. But on 3rd &amp; short, Michel has it again and this time he is wrapped up for no gain! Huge stop there at the KC 42 and the Pats will punt. NE are flagged for a delay of game. Now the punt, and the speed daemon Hill calls for a fair catch at the Chiefs 15. KC\u2019s defense has settled in, but can their offense get it together? Patriots 7-0 Chiefs, 9:07 2nd quarter On 2nd &amp; 7, Brady is nearly picked again! A diving Eric Berry could not come up with the pill. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 7, Brady, facing huge pressure, somehow gets the ball off and finds White who was coming out of the backfield. Ugly but effective: first down, and White has his fourth third down conversion of this young game. You got nothing, but now New England have the ball as the time of possession conquering continues. Patriots 7-0 Chiefs, 11:57 2nd quarter KC starts from their 20. On first down, Mahomes has time, until he doesn\u2019t. The pocket closes fast, the kid runs to his right, then throws it away. Good pressure from New England. Now Travis Kelce has his first reception, a gain of nine on the far sideline. But on 3rd &amp; 1, Damien Williams is stacked up! He\u2019s short on an important conversion attempt and KC will have to punt. If this was a video game, you might go for it. But this isn\u2019t a video game, just to be clear. That was an opportunity lost for the home team as Andy Reid paces the sidelines... NE will start on their 26 when we return. Reggie Ragland picks off Brady in the center of the endzone, and he kneels for the touchback! And that\u2019s the play the defense had to make! Brady had gone over 200 throws without an interception until then. Now, can the Chiefs capitalize on the rare mistake from the Pats? Big 3rd &amp; 2. Brady in the shot gun, takes a step back and throws to the far sideline where Edleman is wide open. It\u2019s a five yard gain down to the Chiefs five-yard line. And that\u2019s how the first quarter ends folks. The Pats have run 23 plays, KC, six. It\u2019s total domination. KC\u2019s gassed defense needs to make a play. Patriots 7-0 Chiefs, 1:13 1st quarter Brady throws right, Patterson has it and he has room! Big block by Gronkowski and it\u2019s an 18-yard gain down the far sideline! Pats inside the 20! Michel has nine carries in the first quarter for 40 yards. Patriots 7-0 Chiefs, 2:19 1st quarter Brady comes out throwing, incomplete on the far sideline looking for Edelman. Then White runs right for four yards and Burkhead goes up the middle for a yards. All that means it\u2019s 3rd &amp; 4. And New England are on the ground AGAIN on third down! Michel runs right for a new set of downs and that is totally demoralizing. The clock is running and the Patriots are moving. They\u2019re on KC\u2019s 33! Email Christopher Lee writes: \u201cC\u2019mon no one wants the Pats to win right? Yes, Yes Brady and Belichick are GOAT, lucky to be watching them and all that but no one actually wants them to win do they?\u201d Outside of New England? Probably not. Where does Tom\u2019s dad live? Patriots 7-0 Chiefs, 4:33 1st quarter Mahomes is sacked on 3rd &amp; 10! Kyle Van Noy wraps up a perfect start for New England as they quickly force a punt following a methodical opening drive. It really can\u2019t get much better for the visitors: the KC crowd are punch drunk. Edelman runs back the punt 11 yards to the KC 45: great field position coming up for Brady, as if he needed any additional help. Patriots 7-0 Chiefs, 5:28 1st quarter Williams is wrapped up by Roberts on 2nd &amp; 5 for a loss of two, and on third down, Mahomes fires incomplete...but there\u2019s a flag. Defensive holding keeps the drive alive for KC. Now Mahomes is throwing deep...to a patch of green grass, which I suppose was near Sammy Watkins. Not looking sharp at the moment on offense are KC. The Patriots, smashing Chiefs mouths, cap a marathon drive with a Sony Michel following a James Develin block into the endzone. That\u2019s 15 plays, 80 yards in 8:05. Can the Chiefs answer? It\u2019s pretty quiet in KC. Patriots 0-0 Chiefs, 7:05 1st quarter Brady looking for White on a screen pass is incomplete, setting up a big 3rd &amp; 7. Brady fires over the middle, complete! Edelman has a first down catch and New England are down to the 16! Moments later the Pats are inside the 10: Michel running to his right with room! First and goal to go and this drive is over eight minutes long! Time out on the field, Chiefs lineman Xavier Williams was shaken up... Patriots 0-0 Chiefs, 9:50 1st quarter On 3rd &amp; 1, White moves right, cuts left, and has a short gain for another first down. New England are on KC\u2019s 30. Patriots 0-0 Chiefs, 10:49 1st quarter Gronk is up and running, a nine-yard catch on the near side to their own 45...and now again, this time his catch is for five yards on the far sideline. 3rd &amp; 4 coming up, and New England is going on the ground, establishing that run! James White has a first down, and that possession time is piling up early as the clock runs. Pats in Chiefs territory. It really happened! The Pats start from their 20 and begin on the ground, right up the gut, Sony Michel a first down and an 11-yard game. We\u2019re off! Happy recap That\u2019s what this is, if you\u2019re a Los Angeles Rams fan of course. National Anthem I usually keep national anthem ratings for the baseball World Seires, but Melissa Etheridge did a heck of a job and I\u2019m giving the Kansas native an 8/10. It sounded a lot of something like this... Prediction Patrick Mahomes, the young, side-arm-throwing phenom is must-see TV and certainly a must-read live blog. So how do you keep him from lighting up New England\u2019s defense, just as he did in the second half of these teams week six matchup? By keeping him off the field of course. Yes, the Pats can get into a track meet with KC, as they did successfully at home earlier this season. But that\u2019s a considerably tougher play on the road. So for the Pats to get out of Arrowhead and into the friendlier confines of Atlanta\u2019s cozy dome, Belichick might recall the job he did as defensive coordinator for the Giants against the Bills in Super Bowl XXV. That\u2019s when he kept a superior Buffalo offense on the sidelines with a meticulous, slow moving, run based attack that controlled the ball for a 40:33. I believe the Pats will come close to pulling something like that off, but not close enough. The final score today? It\u2019s 31-27 of course. What say you? Let us know and we\u2019ll make you famous. Kick-off is coming right up! Well, thanks to a 57-yard field goal by Greg Zuerlein, the Rams move from one German dome to another: Los Angeles have made their fourth Super Bowl in franchise history, three seasons removed from their former home in St Louis. Who will they face in Atlanta? We\u2019ll know soon enough. Fashionistas Snap poll, who won the pre-game fashion bowl? Bundle up? There always seems to be a playoff game in the bitter cold and this year it\u2019s in Kansas City. The Arctic blast is blowing over Arrowhead Stadium, a weather system which will bring temperatures to around 20 degrees Fahrenheit or -6 Celcius at game time, considerably warmer than its been in the region lately. Around once a year I come on here and write pretty much the same exact thing. Cold weather does not matter. Snow matters, rain matters, wind matters. It won\u2019t matter even if the broadcasters tell you it will matter: that is a game sell and this game needs no sell. Patrick Mahomes isn\u2019t going to be out on the field thinking \u201cI wish I was inside right now with some warm coco and an Oreo cookie.\u201d No. He is trying to get his team to the Super Bowl for the first time in decades. Even if Tom Brady does get cold, well, he has a really big coat. So nothing to see here... Perspective After years of tough-luck losses and ineptitude, the Chiefs would love to hoist the Lamar Hunt trophy. Others, not so much. Pregame thoughts OK, let\u2019s just get something out of the way first: this is NOT a referendum on the state of Grandpa Brady and the Pats. No, the referendum game for Brady and Belichick was last week. Had the Pats lost to a Los Angeles Chargers team traveling over 2000 miles to play a January game, in the Northeast, in the divisional round, then it would have been time to start asking questions. That didn\u2019t happen. In fact, the Pats put together their best game of the season, and perhaps in many seasons. So it\u2019s business as usual in New England, even if they should not get past the Chiefs today, on the road, where they\u2019re just 3-5 this season. It\u2019s the Chiefs, with their spectacular 23-year-old rookie quarterback Pat Mahomes and their vaunted but tortured head coach Andy Reid who will play with more pressure today. The Chiefs exorcised their first daemon, winning a home playoff game, last week against the Colts. Now the Pats stand in the watch fa their next hurdle: hoisting the trophy named after their founder Lamar Hunt, a sports visionary who also happened to bring the American Football League into the world. A victory would bring the Chiefs to their first Super Bowl since the early 1970\u2019s while taking some of that piano weight off Reid, who lost his only prior Super Bowl appearance v the Pats while coaching in Philadelphia. Can Reid and the Chiefs reach Atlanta, and a date with the NFC champs in Super Bowl LIII? We guarantee an answer on this live blog, or your money back! So sit back, relax and get ready to read: we\u2019ll have all the action for you as kick-off approaches. Please stand by! Howdy folks, David Lengel here. Welcome to our live coverage of the American Football Conference Championship game between the New England Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs. We\u2019re glad to have you with us! Now get back to the NFC Championship game with Hunter Felt over on Guardian 1. I\u2019ll post some content in the meantime but we\u2019ll see you back in a little bit. Sound good? Excellent. David will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s Hunter Felt\u2019s preview of today\u2019s game: What the Patriots need to do: Make Patrick Mahomes look like a playoff rookie. Mahomes had a successful postseason debut against the Indianapolis Colts, but he didn\u2019t have a passing touchdown (although he did rush for one). That didn\u2019t really matter in a comfortable 31-13 win, but that\u2019s not going to cut it against Tom Brady and the Patriots. Every drive in which the Patriots defense can limit the Chiefs to a field goal (or less) will be crucial if this becomes a shootout similar to the teams\u2019 previous meeting. What the Chiefs need to do: Watch the clock. The Chiefs\u2019 Andy Reid is one of the best head coaches in the league, but he\u2019s also notorious for his poor clock management in big games. If Sunday\u2019s meeting ends up being close down the stretch, both teams must use their timeouts wisely and have perfect awareness of how much time is left (or at least glance at the clock on occasion). Key player for the Patriots: Julian Edelman, WR. There are plenty of benefits to being Tom Brady\u2019s favorite target and that includes climbing up the Most Postseason Receptions list. With his 94th postseason reception last Sunday, Edelman moved up to second on the list, passing Reggie Wayne, and he ended the 41-28 blowout with 98. It\u2019s safe to bet that he won\u2019t beat Jerry Rice\u2019s record of 151 but he\u2019s probably a good bet to break the 100 mark this Sunday. Key player for the Chiefs: Damien Williams, RB. You think the Patriots regret not signing Williams? Kansas City\u2019s running game could have taken a stumble when they cut Kareem Hunt. Instead they inserted Williams who has thrived in their system. He is coming off a 129-yard performance against the Colts. Unheralded player to watch: Cordarrelle Patterson, KR, New England Patriots. Patterson is technically a wide receiver, but the Patriots used him as a running back during the regular season when Sony Michel was unavailable. Now that Michel is healthy, as his mammoth game against the Chargers established, Patterson\u2019s biggest impact will be as a kick returner. In fact, Los Angeles brought in a second kicker, Nick Rose, to handle kickoffs and limit Patterson\u2019s chances (he would end up returning just one kick, for 23 yards). In a game that may well come down to the wire, one huge return could end up being key. Prediction: Patriots 31-34 Chiefs",

There are concerns about him after he apparently slept-drove to the Purcell house. He\u2019s sure he\u2019s fine but Hays can\u2019t even remember who drove him home the day before. They don\u2019t say as much but the implication is that he has dementia. \u201cWe can say what it almost certainly is,\u201d says the doctor.

Hays remembers the Purcell kids\u2019 lie about meeting Ronny. \u201cWhat were they up to. What were they really doing?\u201d he asks. The pair return to interview Ronny, who says that they didn\u2019t hang out with the Purcell kids much at all. So how were they filling their evenings after school? They go over an old photo album and find a picture of Will\u2019s first communion, where he is posing in the same way he was found when he died: hands clasped in prayer, eyes closed.</p> <p>Hays and West go back through the drawings they found at the Purcell house. West finds something that looks like a map, while Hays rummages through a tote bag and finds some cryptic notes with phrases like \u201cit\u2019s alright\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t listen\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll always keep you safe\u201d written on them. The tote bag comes from a company called Hoyt Foods, where the Purcell kids\u2019 mother used to work on the chicken line. She quit about a year ago to start bartending.

They show her the prints they have but they are only partial as they didn\u2019t get to work the scene for long. Meanwhile, Hays has a panicked trip to the supermarket when his daughter Rebecca goes missing for a brief moment. The case has obviously stayed with him, even a decade later, and his own frantic searching echoes the disconcerted feeling of the townsfolk.</p> <p>When Amelia returns from her fishing expedition, Hays isn\u2019t impressed with her excitement about the case or her book. He finds the whole thing distasteful. Amelia says she might get access to the surveillance footage, and she was also able to find out the police think Julie was a customer, not a shoplifter.</p> <p>In 1980, the duo are at the Ozark Children\u2019s Outreach Center \u2013 the organisation that put out the $10,000 reward, which is bringing out lots of bizarre tips. The foundation was started by Mr Hoyt (the man behind Hoyt Foods) after he lost his granddaughter a few years ago. Hoyt has been in Africa on safari since mid-October, we\u2019re told.

They\u2019re discussing the war \u2013 Hays fought, Amelia protested \u2013 and the poem that Amelia was teaching when Hays first met her. She thinks it means that we can\u2019t be separated by time, while Hays thinks it\u2019s to do with God and the fact the Hebrews weren\u2019t allowed to say God\u2019s name. Amelia looks shocked but impressed by Hays\u2019 savant-like reading of the poem, then agrees to go out to dinner with her. Hats off for the literary chirpsing.</p> <p>Hays finds some dice in the woods, along with a bag containing action figures and a trail of blood on some nearby rocks. \u201cThat\u2019s where the boy died,\u201d Hays tells West, as the pair approach a house close to the scene. The homeowner is a fairly spiky fella who has already been questioned by someone with a badge. It\u2019s not clear if that was a police officer, and he won\u2019t allow them to search his property without a warrant. He says he saw the kids near his house four or five times, before they disappeared into the woods. He also saw a car too, a brown sedan with a black man and a white woman in it.</p> <h2>\u2018You\u2019re worried what they\u2019ll find\u2019</h2> <p>In 2015, the true-crime documentary team are picking holes in the 1980 case. Apparently, people who lived in the neighbourhood weren\u2019t thoroughly questioned and one mentioned a black man with a scar who was seen playing with the children before Will\u2019s death. The police never followed up and didn\u2019t include it in the report. The interview comes to an abrupt end after Hays\u2019 son Henry steps in.</p> <p>The interviewer\u2019s querying of Hays\u2019 case work prompts Hays to retrace his steps. He has a vision of Amelia who starts going on a Rust Cohle-esque speech about \u201cinfinite dimensions\u201d and Einstein\u2019s theories on the concept of time. \u201cYou\u2019re worried what they\u2019ll find,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat you left in the woods.\u201d She tells him to \u201cfinish it\u201d and then vanishes back into his imagination.</p> <p>Back in 1990 Hays is invited to a meeting by West, who is now a lieutenant in the state police. They meet at a veterans bar and West tells Hays about a new task force he\u2019s putting together, and wants Hays to join. They also hint at why Hays was canned while West climbed the ladder. \u201cDid the job come from merit or did it come with the pigmentation?\u201d asks Hays. \u201cUnlike some others I lacked a big mouth,\u201d responds West. We also find out West was shot while working the Purcell case, which didn\u2019t do his career any harm.</p> <h2>Recommended reading</h2> <p>There are a lot of good recaps knocking about.

After years of breakneck expansion, official data on Monday confirmed that China\u2019s growth in 2018 was the country\u2019s slowest reported rate since 1990 and down from 6.8% in 2017. The 6.4% growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2018 was last seen in early 2009 at the height of the global financial crisis. \u201cWe see that there are changes in stability, concern about these changes. The external environment is complicated and severe. The economy is facing downward pressure,\u201d said Ning Jizhe, director of China\u2019s National Statistic Bureau, adding that China\u2019s economy remained \u201csteady overall\u201d. Monday\u2019s data, while in line with expectations, puts pressure on Beijing to reach a deal with Washington to end the bruising trade war. \u201cChina-US conflict is indeed affecting China\u2019s economy, that is true, but the impact is manageable,\u201d Ning said. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.4% while Japan\u2019s Nikkei gained 0.5%. China\u2019s CSI300 index rose 0.97%. The latest economic figures suggest China may no longer be able to help shore up weakening global growth. A government campaign to rein in risky debt has been compounded by a trade war with the US, hitting consumer and business confidence. Over the past few months consumer spending, manufacturing output, and investment have reached record lows. So far China has held back from deploying the stimulus measures used in 2009 that resulted in a binge of infrastructure projects and bad debt taken on by companies and local governments. Analysts say stimulus measures would not only undo government efforts to lower risk in the financial system, but are no longer effective in spurring growth. \u201cThe data confirms a challenging period for China\u2019s economy, with weakness discernible across different sectors,\u201d said Tom Rafferty, principal economist for China at the Economist Intelligence Unit.

Codey Herrmann, 20, made a brief appearance at the Melbourne magistrates court on Monday. He did not make an application for bail and has been remanded in custody for a committal hearing in June. Herrmann sat quietly in the dock wearing the same green T-shirt he was wearing in his first court appearance on Saturday. It is his first time in custody. Maasarwe, 21, was found dead behind bushes next to the car park of the Polaris shopping centre just off Main Drive in Bundoora on Wednesday morning. The Israeli citizen, who was studying at La Trobe College on exchange from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, had attended a comedy club in North Melbourne on Tuesday night before catching the 86 tram home and alighting at the stop at the corner Plenty Road and Main Drive about midnight. She was found a short distance from the tram stop and less than 1km from her off-campus apartment on Main Drive. Herrmann was arrested in Greensborough on Friday and has been charged with murder and one count of rape. Details of the allegations and Maasarwe\u2019s injuries have not been released out of consideration for her family. The coroner was expected to release her body for repatriation and burial late Monday. Her father, Saeed Maasarwe, arrived in Melbourne on Thursday and attended several public vigils for his daughter, who he described as \u201call the time smiling\u201d. \u201cShe loved people, she had very big opinions, her mind open for everything,\u201d he told reporters on Friday. \u201cShe liked to study different cultures, different nationality.

      "bodyText": "The Australian Academy of Science will assemble a group of freshwater ecologists, climate scientists, biodiversity, water management and Indigenous water resource experts to give independent scientific advice to uncover what events may have led to a mass fish kill on the Darling River. The move comes after Labor leader Bill Shorten asked some of Australia\u2019s leading scientists to examine the causes of the ecological disaster \u2013 which led to the death of up to 1 million fish \u2013 with a report to be produced in time for the first sitting week of parliament. In a letter to the academy Shorten said: \u201cAustralians, who are rightly troubled by what they have seen, deserve a speedy yet thorough examination of why this has taken place, based on the best possible science. \u201cAs leader of the opposition, my immediate priority is to uncover what has taken place, and ensure we have the scientific evidence before the Parliament to inform decisions for a healthy river system.\u201d The three week investigation will examine four key points: how the fish kills took place and what caused the magnitude of the event, whether water diversions and management practices exacerbated or caused the disaster, whether chemicals and fertiliser were a contributing factor, and what immediate steps can be taken to improve the river system\u2019s health and management. The expert group will also provide advice on whether climate change has led to a steep change in inflows into the river system. The academy will conduct its investigation using existing peer-reviewed research and data, but has not ruled out travelling to Menindee or other affected areas. \u201cScience is critical to support decision making in creating and maintaining a healthy river system in Australia,\u201d the academy\u2019s president, John Shine, said on Monday. \u201cThe Australian Academy of Science will commence work immediately by consulting with the other learned academies to convene a group of multidisciplinary experts to provide independent scientific advice on this matter.\u201d The academy will produce its report, which Labor has promised to make public, by 10 February, the day before the first sitting week of parliament for 2019 begins. It comes as more fish continue to die in the Menindee area, with locals concerned there could be another fish kill if there is a sudden drop in water temperature. Shorten\u2019s letter said \u201cthe Murray-Darling is a critically important river system in Australia, sustaining life for countless native plant and animal species, as well as supporting our important agricultural industries. \u201cIf we are to be responsible custodians of our country, we must restore the rivers to health, and we cannot do this without drawing on scientific experts.\u201d",

Despite being placed in a tricky group comprised of Middle Eastern teams \u2013 who the Socceroos traditionally struggle against \u2013 the defending champions were expected to win it. Some pre-tournament chatter emanating from the camp suggested Graham Arnold and his team were also confident of achieving this objective.</p> <p>Failure to do so means the Socceroos face a stern test in the round of 16, as they return to the Khalifa bin Zayed Stadium in Al Ain to face Uzbekistan. The Uzbeks enjoyed a positive group phase, but failure to claim a critical point in their final game against Japan meant they also finished second in their group. Wins against Turkmenistan and Oman ensured they finished with the same group stage record as Australia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/jan/18/david-squires-on-the-socceroos-progress-at-the-asian-cup\">David Squires on ... the Socceroos' progress at the Asian Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the Socceroos\u2019 performances at the tournament thus far have done little to inspire confidence in a successful title defence, Graham Arnold stresses his team is continually learning. Arnold is learning too. The way his starting XI has shaped since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/06/socceroos-stunned-by-jordan-as-asian-cup-defence-gets-off-to-nightmare-start\">the opening defeat to Jordan</a> has led to marked improvements in performances, especially in attack.</p> <p>Chris Ikonomidis has been a breath of fresh air since he replaced Robbie Kruse in the team, while Jackson Irvine has added his trademark brand of physicality and impetus in midfield. The forced inclusion of Rhyan Grant after Josh Risdon came off injured against Jordan has also been pivotal in improving Australia\u2019s attack, with his flowing mullet a regular sight darting into dangerous positions on the right flank.</p> <p>Arnold is forging a clear identity for his team and the way he wants them to play. He makes no secret of the fact that Tom Rogic is the centrepiece and that allowing the Celtic midfielder freedom to express himself on the pitch is key to unlocking his potential. Outside of that, Arnold has also noted that he wants the team to play with the ball on the floor, he wants his attackers pressing high up the pitch and he wants his wingers attacking the penalty area and moving into goalscoring positions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bf6192406b343f9514afad8201b95dc0b41aa3f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf6192406b343f9514afad8201b95dc0b41aa3f9/0_0_1964_2706/726.jpg\" alt=\"Awer Mabil celebrates\" width=\"726\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Awer Mabil celebrates with Graham Arnold after scoring against Syria in Al Ain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ali Haider/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The squad loves playing for Arnold too. Awer Mabil\u2019s animated goal celebration after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/15/tom-rogic-late-show-guides-socceroos-past-syria-into-asian-cup-last-16\">his screamer against Syria</a>, which somehow didn\u2019t put his manager\u2019s back out as he leapt on top of him, was a clear example of this. It is slowly starting to reflect on the pitch, with the team\u2019s attack flowing more smoothly and creating more chances with each passing game.</p> <p>Feel-good does not guarantee winning though. Uzbekistan will feel confident that if they can regroup from their defeat and organise themselves defensively that they will be able to stifle the Socceroos in the same way Jordan were able to. They too will possess their own threat on the break, with 23-year-old attacker Eldor Shomurodov in excellent form with three goals already this tournament.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s main issue is that they are predictable going forward. But at their best, they can also be unstoppable. Taking advantage of opportunities in front of goal will be key, but the sheer number of clear-cut chances created against Syria bodes well for the Socceroos heading into the knockout stage.</p> <p>Every opposition manager has stressed the importance of limiting supply and space to Rogic, but he too is impossible to contain at his best. After a disappointing outing against Jordan, the creative midfielder produced two masterful displays \u2013 perhaps his best for the national team \u2013 which have now set a benchmark even higher than the lofty expectations Socceroos fans already placed on him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Heading forward, the margin for error now is zero, and a round of 16 exit will be classed as a failure despite the \u201cfour-year journey\u201d Arnold stresses that his young team is on. All leeway was spent in the opening fixture against Jordan, where Arnold\u2019s team selection played a critical role in denying the Socceroos a far easier knockout tie against Vietnam. While the four-year journey is important, Arnold must ensure he makes this tournament a four-week journey as he vies to leave a lasting legacy with the national team.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is no doubt the Socceroos group stage campaign at the Asian Cup was a disappointment. Despite being placed in a tricky group comprised of Middle Eastern teams \u2013 who the Socceroos traditionally struggle against \u2013 the defending champions were expected to win it. Some pre-tournament chatter emanating from the camp suggested Graham Arnold and his team were also confident of achieving this objective. Failure to do so means the Socceroos face a stern test in the round of 16, as they return to the Khalifa bin Zayed Stadium in Al Ain to face Uzbekistan. The Uzbeks enjoyed a positive group phase, but failure to claim a critical point in their final game against Japan meant they also finished second in their group. Wins against Turkmenistan and Oman ensured they finished with the same group stage record as Australia. While the Socceroos\u2019 performances at the tournament thus far have done little to inspire confidence in a successful title defence, Graham Arnold stresses his team is continually learning. Arnold is learning too. The way his starting XI has shaped since the opening defeat to Jordan has led to marked improvements in performances, especially in attack. Chris Ikonomidis has been a breath of fresh air since he replaced Robbie Kruse in the team, while Jackson Irvine has added his trademark brand of physicality and impetus in midfield. The forced inclusion of Rhyan Grant after Josh Risdon came off injured against Jordan has also been pivotal in improving Australia\u2019s attack, with his flowing mullet a regular sight darting into dangerous positions on the right flank. Arnold is forging a clear identity for his team and the way he wants them to play. He makes no secret of the fact that Tom Rogic is the centrepiece and that allowing the Celtic midfielder freedom to express himself on the pitch is key to unlocking his potential. Outside of that, Arnold has also noted that he wants the team to play with the ball on the floor, he wants his attackers pressing high up the pitch and he wants his wingers attacking the penalty area and moving into goalscoring positions. The squad loves playing for Arnold too. Awer Mabil\u2019s animated goal celebration after his screamer against Syria, which somehow didn\u2019t put his manager\u2019s back out as he leapt on top of him, was a clear example of this. It is slowly starting to reflect on the pitch, with the team\u2019s attack flowing more smoothly and creating more chances with each passing game. Feel-good does not guarantee winning though. Uzbekistan will feel confident that if they can regroup from their defeat and organise themselves defensively that they will be able to stifle the Socceroos in the same way Jordan were able to. They too will possess their own threat on the break, with 23-year-old attacker Eldor Shomurodov in excellent form with three goals already this tournament. Australia\u2019s main issue is that they are predictable going forward. But at their best, they can also be unstoppable. Taking advantage of opportunities in front of goal will be key, but the sheer number of clear-cut chances created against Syria bodes well for the Socceroos heading into the knockout stage. Every opposition manager has stressed the importance of limiting supply and space to Rogic, but he too is impossible to contain at his best. After a disappointing outing against Jordan, the creative midfielder produced two masterful displays \u2013 perhaps his best for the national team \u2013 which have now set a benchmark even higher than the lofty expectations Socceroos fans already placed on him. Heading forward, the margin for error now is zero, and a round of 16 exit will be classed as a failure despite the \u201cfour-year journey\u201d Arnold stresses that his young team is on. All leeway was spent in the opening fixture against Jordan, where Arnold\u2019s team selection played a critical role in denying the Socceroos a far easier knockout tie against Vietnam. While the four-year journey is important, Arnold must ensure he makes this tournament a four-week journey as he vies to leave a lasting legacy with the national team.",

      "bodyText": "House prices in some of Britain\u2019s wealthiest areas have had up to 25% wiped off their value in 12 months as Brexit turmoil continues, according to the estate agent Your Move. That has meant typical price falls in some cases of almost \u00a3500,000. Meanwhile, data from the property website Rightmove revealed the average asking price of a London home had fallen below \u00a3600,000 for the first time since August 2015, and was well below its peak of almost \u00a3650,000 reached a few weeks before the Brexit vote in 2016. The two sets of figures come days after Britain\u2019s surveyors issued an especially gloomy assessment, fuelled by the lack of clarity over Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. On Thursday, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said house prices were falling at their fastest rate in six years, and that the outlook for sales was the weakest in two decades. Your Move, which claims to be the UK\u2019s biggest estate agent, said house prices in England and Wales rose 0.3% in December, but were falling in real terms when adjusted for inflation. London is the area most obviously affected by the uncertainty, given the influence of wealthy foreign buyers, and Your Move said there had been big falls in a few key boroughs at the top of the market. The average house price in Kensington and Chelsea, the UK\u2019s most expensive place to buy a home, dropped by more than a fifth (21.2%), during the last 12 months, from \u00a32.25m to \u00a31.77m. In Westminster, the second most expensive area, typical prices fell by a quarter (24.8%), from \u00a31.93m to \u00a31.45m. Recent high-end sales in Westminster included a mansion on Belgrave Square bought for \u00a360m. The five-storey stucco-fronted property had been on the market for almost a decade and was first listed at \u00a3100m. Other London boroughs said to have experienced double-digit price falls over the past year include Hammersmith and Fulham, where the average property value dropped 19%, from \u00a31.08m to \u00a3873,000, Camden (down 11.5%) and Tower Hamlets (down 11.3%). Earlier this month, one property firm said sterling\u2019s slump since the Brexit vote had turned the UK into a goldmine for foreign investors seeking a bargain. However, prices in 10 London boroughs were up over the year. According to Your Move, the annual rate of price growth for England and Wales is 0.6%, the lowest level since spring 2012. Oliver Blake, the firm\u2019s managing director, said that amid the political and economic uncertainty, \u201cit is understandable why buyers and sellers may be taking a \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach to the property market\u201d. However, he added that this meant homes may become more affordable to more people. Rightmove said the UK market had undergone a muted and patchy start to 2019, with the lowest monthly price rise seen at this time of year since January 2012. Its data showed the average asking price of a UK home had risen by 0.4%, or \u00a31,207 in monetary terms, during the past month, taking it to \u00a3298,734. Three out of 11 regions had price falls over the past month. These included London, where the average new seller asking price dipped 1.5% to \u00a3593,972. In Wales, the monthly fall was 1.9%, while the East Midlands recorded a 0.3% decline. The Rightmove website, which claims to feature about 90% of all properties for sale, said there had been a \u201cpatchy but active start to the year, with more northerly regions faring better in terms of pricing power and willingness to move than those farther south\u201d. It added that in London, a larger than usual seasonal fall had reduced average new seller asking prices to below \u00a3600,000 for the first time since August 2015.

She ultimately walked out of the home she shared with her husband in Essex on 30 June \u2013 and just three months later on 3 October he was handed a two-year jail sentence after pleading guilty to engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour. The Guardian understands the government is considering a review of the effectiveness of coercive control offence to improve understanding, raise awareness and increase the number of prosecutions. As part of the domestic abuse bill announced on Monday, the statutory guidance and Crown Prosecution Service legal guidance for the controlling or coercive behaviour offence has been updated. Natalie says she understands that controlling and coercive behaviour \u2013 with its absence of physical violence \u2013 is still an abstract concept to some, and wants to share her experience so others might recognise they are victims too. \u201cThe main reason for me to talk about what happened is I suffered so alone I became ill, and I don\u2019t want people to get to that stage,\u201d she says. \u201cNobody is alone.

No one should be condemned to an earlier grave or a life of illiteracy simply because they were born poor. <br><br>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way \u2013 there is enough wealth in the world to provide everyone with a fair chance in life. Governments should act to ensure that taxes raised from wealth and businesses paying their fair share are used to fund free, good-quality public services that can save and transform people\u2019s lives.\u201d</p> <p>The report said many governments were making inequality worse by failing to invest enough in public services. It noted that about 10,000 people per day die for lack of healthcare and there were 262 million children not in school, often because their parents were unable to afford the fees, uniforms or textbooks.</p> <p>Oxfam said governments needed to do more to fund high-quality, universal public services through tackling tax dodging and ensuring fairer taxation, including on corporations and the richest individuals\u2019 wealth, which it said were often undertaxed.</p> <p>A global wealth tax has been called for by the French economist Thomas Piketty, who has said action is needed to arrest the trend in inequality.</p> <p>The World Inequality Report 2018 \u2013 co-authored by Piketty \u2013 showed that between 1980 and 2016 the poorest 50% of humanity only captured 12 cents in every dollar of global income growth.

      "bodyText": "The growing concentration of the world\u2019s wealth has been highlighted by a report showing that the 26 richest billionaires own as many assets as the 3.8 billion people who make up the poorest half of the planet\u2019s population. In an annual wealth check released to mark the start of the World Economic Forum in Davos, the development charity Oxfam said 2018 had been a year in which the rich had grown richer and the poor poorer. It said the widening gap was hindering the fight against poverty, adding that a wealth tax on the 1% would raise an estimated $418bn (\u00a3325bn) a year \u2013 enough to educate every child not in school and provide healthcare that would prevent 3 million deaths. Oxfam said the wealth of more than 2,200 billionaires across the globe had increased by $900bn in 2018 \u2013 or $2.5bn a day. The 12% increase in the wealth of the very richest contrasted with a fall of 11% in the wealth of the poorest half of the world\u2019s population. As a result, the report concluded, the number of billionaires owning as much wealth as half the world\u2019s population fell from 43 in 2017 to 26 last year. In 2016 the number was 61. Among the findings of the report were: In the 10 years since the financial crisis, the number of billionaires has nearly doubled. Between 2017 and 2018 a new billionaire was created every two days. The world\u2019s richest man, Jeff Bezos, the owner of Amazon, saw his fortune increase to $112bn. Just 1% of his fortune is equivalent to the whole health budget for Ethiopia, a country of 105 million people. The poorest 10% of Britons are paying a higher effective tax rate than the richest 10% (49% compared with 34%) once taxes on consumption such as VAT are taken into account. Oxfam\u2019s director of campaigns and policy, Matthew Spencer, said: \u201cThe massive fall in the number of people living in extreme poverty is one of the greatest achievements of the past quarter of a century but rising inequality is jeopardising further progress. \u201cThe way our economies are organised means wealth is increasingly and unfairly concentrated among a privileged few while millions of people are barely subsisting. Women are dying for lack of decent maternity care and children are being denied an education that could be their route out of poverty. No one should be condemned to an earlier grave or a life of illiteracy simply because they were born poor. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way \u2013 there is enough wealth in the world to provide everyone with a fair chance in life. Governments should act to ensure that taxes raised from wealth and businesses paying their fair share are used to fund free, good-quality public services that can save and transform people\u2019s lives.\u201d The report said many governments were making inequality worse by failing to invest enough in public services. It noted that about 10,000 people per day die for lack of healthcare and there were 262 million children not in school, often because their parents were unable to afford the fees, uniforms or textbooks. Oxfam said governments needed to do more to fund high-quality, universal public services through tackling tax dodging and ensuring fairer taxation, including on corporations and the richest individuals\u2019 wealth, which it said were often undertaxed. A global wealth tax has been called for by the French economist Thomas Piketty, who has said action is needed to arrest the trend in inequality. The World Inequality Report 2018 \u2013 co-authored by Piketty \u2013 showed that between 1980 and 2016 the poorest 50% of humanity only captured 12 cents in every dollar of global income growth. By contrast, the top 1% captured 27 cents of every dollar. Oxfam said that in addition to tackling inequality at home, developed nations currently failing to meet their overseas aid commitments could raise the missing billions needed to tackle extreme poverty in the poorest countries by increasing taxes on extreme wealth. China\u2019s rapid growth over the past four decades has been responsible for much of the decline in extreme poverty but Oxfam said World Bank data showed the rate of poverty reduction had halved since 2013. In sub-Saharan Africa, extreme poverty was on the increase. Oxfam said its methodology for assessing the gap between rich and poor was based on global wealth distribution data provided by the Credit Suisse global wealth data book, covering the period from June 2017 to June 2018. The wealth of billionaires was calculated using the annual Forbes billionaires list published in March 2018. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 January 2019 to clarify that the figure of 10,000 people dying for lack of healthcare is per day.",

      "body": "<p>High-risk domestic abuse offenders could face mandatory lie-detector tests when released from prison under long-awaited proposals published on Monday.</p> <p>The Home Office, meanwhile, has released analysis that puts the cost of domestic abuse in England and Wales at about \u00a366bn a year.</p> <p>The polygraph tests piloted on offenders on licence are part of a broad package of measures under the domestic abuse bill, which also includes \u2013 in a victory for campaigners who pressed the government on the issue \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/20/ban-on-cross-examination-of-domestic-abuse-victims\">ban on the cross-examination of victims</a> by their abusers in the family courts.</p> <p>Other measures include the introduction of domestic abuse protection orders, which will place restrictions on offenders, and the introduction of the first ever statutory government definition of domestic abuse to specifically include economic abuse and controlling and manipulative non-physical abuse.</p> <p>Alongside the bill, the Home Office released research on the cost of domestic abuse to society. The majority of the cost \u2013 \u00a347bn \u2013 is attributed to the physical and emotional harm caused by domestic abuse, but the \u00a366bn total also includes other factors such as the cost to health services of \u00a32.3bn, the cost to police of \u00a31.3bn and and the cost to victim services of \u00a3724m.</p> <p>The prime minister, Theresa May, said: \u201cThroughout my political career I have worked to bring an end to domestic abuse and support survivors as they take the brave decision to leave their abuser and rebuild their lives.</p> <p>\u201cWe know, from the harrowing experiences of victims and their families, that there is still more to do to stamp out this life-shattering crime and the domestic abuse bill will lead the way in bringing about the changes we need to achieve this.\u201d</p> <p>The minister for crime, safeguarding and vulnerability, Victoria Atkins, said: \u201cI have heard absolutely heartbreaking accounts of victims whose lives have been ripped apart because of physical, emotional or economic abuse they have suffered by someone close to them.</p> <p>\u201cThe draft domestic abuse bill recognises the complex nature of these horrific crimes and puts the needs of victims and their families at the forefront.</p> <p>\u201cThis government is absolutely committed to shining a light on domestic abuse to ensure this hidden crime does not remain in the shadows.\u201d</p> <p>Domestic violence charities broadly welcomed the bill but said resources should be made available to ensure it was effective.</p> <p>Katie Ghose, the chief executive of Women\u2019s Aid, said: \u201cDomestic abuse costs lives and it costs money. It is happening at epidemic levels yet it has been largely hidden behind closed doors. Now is the time to bring it out into the spotlight and address the impact of domestic abuse properly once and for all.</p> <p>\u201cThe domestic abuse bill has the potential to create a step-change in the national response and this must be backed up with sustainable funding for our lifesaving network of specialist support services to make a real difference to survivors\u2019 lives.\u201d</p> <p>About 2 million adults are estimated to have experienced domestic abuse each year, affecting almost 6% of all adults. Women are twice as likely to be victims than men.</p> <p>Under domestic abuse protection orders, perpetrators could be required to attend rehabilitation programmes where substance abuse was a factor in that abuse, or other behaviour change programmes.</p> <p>The legislation will introduce automatic eligibility for victims for special measures in criminal courts to reduce the stress of giving evidence in criminal proceedings and will include the appointment of a domestic abuse commissioner, who will work to ensure that services are provided.</p> <p>The statutory guidance and Crown Prosecution Service legal guidance for the offence of controlling or coercive behaviour will also be updated.</p> <p>Sandra Horley, the chief executive of Refuge, said: \u201cThe cost [of domestic violence] to women\u2019s and children\u2019s lives is devastating. But now the immense cost to the taxpayer has been laid bare, too. Domestic violence is truly everybody\u2019s business.</p> <p>\u201cThis bill represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to address domestic violence; but in order to do so, we must ensure its aspirations are matched by adequate resource. We will continue to work closely with the government to ensure the final bill meets the needs of the women and children we support.\u201d</p> <p>Suzanne Jacob OBE, the chief executive of SafeLives, said: \u201cThe government estimates today that perpetrators cost the economy \u00a366bn \u2013 more than the cost of alcohol and drug misuse, cigarettes and obesity combined. It affects more than 2 million people every year.</p> <p>\u201cFor too long, we\u2019ve expected victims and children to uproot their lives while the perpetrators remain invisible and unchallenged by the system. The new change in approach reflects what hundreds of survivors told SafeLives they wanted \u2013 we\u2019re pleased the government is listening.\u201d</p> <p>The draft bill will introduce measures to address coercive control and economic abuse, how domestic abuse affects children and transform the response in the justice system.</p> <p>A series of non-legislative measures were also announced, including \u00a38m of Home Office funding to support children affected by domestic abuse, implementing a domestic abuse specialist in each jobcentre who will receive further training on how to support claimants who are victims of domestic abuse, and additional \u00a3500,000 funding for provisions for male victims.</p>",

The Home Office, meanwhile, has released analysis that puts the cost of domestic abuse in England and Wales at about \u00a366bn a year. The polygraph tests piloted on offenders on licence are part of a broad package of measures under the domestic abuse bill, which also includes \u2013 in a victory for campaigners who pressed the government on the issue \u2013 a ban on the cross-examination of victims by their abusers in the family courts. Other measures include the introduction of domestic abuse protection orders, which will place restrictions on offenders, and the introduction of the first ever statutory government definition of domestic abuse to specifically include economic abuse and controlling and manipulative non-physical abuse. Alongside the bill, the Home Office released research on the cost of domestic abuse to society. The majority of the cost \u2013 \u00a347bn \u2013 is attributed to the physical and emotional harm caused by domestic abuse, but the \u00a366bn total also includes other factors such as the cost to health services of \u00a32.3bn, the cost to police of \u00a31.3bn and and the cost to victim services of \u00a3724m. The prime minister, Theresa May, said: \u201cThroughout my political career I have worked to bring an end to domestic abuse and support survivors as they take the brave decision to leave their abuser and rebuild their lives. \u201cWe know, from the harrowing experiences of victims and their families, that there is still more to do to stamp out this life-shattering crime and the domestic abuse bill will lead the way in bringing about the changes we need to achieve this.\u201d The minister for crime, safeguarding and vulnerability, Victoria Atkins, said: \u201cI have heard absolutely heartbreaking accounts of victims whose lives have been ripped apart because of physical, emotional or economic abuse they have suffered by someone close to them. \u201cThe draft domestic abuse bill recognises the complex nature of these horrific crimes and puts the needs of victims and their families at the forefront. \u201cThis government is absolutely committed to shining a light on domestic abuse to ensure this hidden crime does not remain in the shadows.\u201d Domestic violence charities broadly welcomed the bill but said resources should be made available to ensure it was effective. Katie Ghose, the chief executive of Women\u2019s Aid, said: \u201cDomestic abuse costs lives and it costs money. It is happening at epidemic levels yet it has been largely hidden behind closed doors. Now is the time to bring it out into the spotlight and address the impact of domestic abuse properly once and for all. \u201cThe domestic abuse bill has the potential to create a step-change in the national response and this must be backed up with sustainable funding for our lifesaving network of specialist support services to make a real difference to survivors\u2019 lives.\u201d About 2 million adults are estimated to have experienced domestic abuse each year, affecting almost 6% of all adults. Women are twice as likely to be victims than men. Under domestic abuse protection orders, perpetrators could be required to attend rehabilitation programmes where substance abuse was a factor in that abuse, or other behaviour change programmes. The legislation will introduce automatic eligibility for victims for special measures in criminal courts to reduce the stress of giving evidence in criminal proceedings and will include the appointment of a domestic abuse commissioner, who will work to ensure that services are provided. The statutory guidance and Crown Prosecution Service legal guidance for the offence of controlling or coercive behaviour will also be updated. Sandra Horley, the chief executive of Refuge, said: \u201cThe cost [of domestic violence] to women\u2019s and children\u2019s lives is devastating. But now the immense cost to the taxpayer has been laid bare, too. Domestic violence is truly everybody\u2019s business. \u201cThis bill represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to address domestic violence; but in order to do so, we must ensure its aspirations are matched by adequate resource. We will continue to work closely with the government to ensure the final bill meets the needs of the women and children we support.\u201d Suzanne Jacob OBE, the chief executive of SafeLives, said: \u201cThe government estimates today that perpetrators cost the economy \u00a366bn \u2013 more than the cost of alcohol and drug misuse, cigarettes and obesity combined. It affects more than 2 million people every year. \u201cFor too long, we\u2019ve expected victims and children to uproot their lives while the perpetrators remain invisible and unchallenged by the system. The new change in approach reflects what hundreds of survivors told SafeLives they wanted \u2013 we\u2019re pleased the government is listening.\u201d The draft bill will introduce measures to address coercive control and economic abuse, how domestic abuse affects children and transform the response in the justice system. A series of non-legislative measures were also announced, including \u00a38m of Home Office funding to support children affected by domestic abuse, implementing a domestic abuse specialist in each jobcentre who will receive further training on how to support claimants who are victims of domestic abuse, and additional \u00a3500,000 funding for provisions for male victims.",

The study by the Education Policy Institute found children in Wales did as well as or better than their peers in England until the end of primary school. But by the time of GCSEs at the age of 16, those in England were more likely to get grade C or above. The new study says that one difference is that England has more than twice as many pupils from minority ethnic groups, \u201cwho tend to perform better at GCSE level\u201d. England\u2019s school-age population has about 30% of pupils from minority ethnic families, compared with just 12% in Wales. The report\u2019s author, Luke Sibieta, said: \u201cThere seems little doubt that teenagers in Wales display worse educational outcomes than children in England. However, we also found evidence that younger pupils in Wales perform much better, equalling the literacy levels of pupils in England. It is important that policymakers understand what might be driving the different performance gaps.\u201d The study also said that higher levels of poverty in Wales may play a part, and that the relative gap between rich and poor in Wales was wider than the gap in England. That finding was disputed by Welsh educationalists, who pointed to results from the OECD\u2019s Pisa survey in 2015 as showing that the gap between rich and poor pupils in Wales was smaller than that in England, Scotland or Northern Ireland. A spokesperson for the Welsh government said: \u201cOf course we are committed to raising standards and aspirations for all young people. This is why we are delivering the biggest education reform programme anywhere in the UK. \u201cSince 2016, we\u2019ve increased investment for our poorest pupils, reformed teacher training, and introduced the first ever programme to support our more able learners.

Pressure to keep a school\u2019s results above the English government\u2019s floor standards encouraged many into entering pupils for vocational GCSE-equivalents. The researchers plan further studies \u201cto uncover the relative importance of family background and schools in explaining these cross-country differences\u201d between Wales and England. Tim Pratt, the director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, said it was important to remember that Wales had many areas of significant disadvantage. \u201cFunding for schools in Wales is even worse than it is in England and needs to be improved as a matter of urgency if our ambitious plans for an exciting and forward-thinking new curriculum in Wales are to be turned into reality,\u201d Pratt said. The study says exam changes in both countries has created \u201csignificant challenges for universities and employers seeking to make comparisons in applicants\u2019 GCSEs taken in England and Wales, and across different years\u201d.",

Two-fifths of UK adults now want their funeral to be a celebratory affair, according to Co-op Funeralcare, while soaring demand for personalisation means the provider has seen requests for alternative hearses, such as adapted Land Rovers and rainbow-hued vehicles, rise by a fifth in three years. The trends are revealed in January \u2013 a grim month when there are typically 30% more deaths recorded in the second week than in any other week during the rest of the year \u2013 and a busy one for the funeral industry, now worth more than \u00a32bn a year. Last year the Co-op launched a large-scale national study into dying in the UK \u2013 in which more than 30,000 Britons were questioned - in an effort to break taboos around the subject and to encourage people to discuss their wishes. That revealed that 41% want their funeral to be a celebration of life rather than a sad occasion. A further 20% say they will ask mourners to wear bright colours instead of traditional black. The UK\u2019s biggest funeral chain highlighted its \u201cquirkiest\u201d funerals from 2018, which included a Christmas in July send-off with Santa, Rudolph and Santa\u2019s little helpers in attendance and family and friends dressed in Christmas jumpers despite the scorching summer heat. In a McDonald\u2019s-themed send-off for teenager Joshua Connolly-Teale \u2013 a fan of the fast-food chain \u2013 the cortege travelled to the local McDonald\u2019s drivethrough before stopping in the car park to allow family and friends to dispatch balloons. The family returned to the restaurant for the wake. Heather Perry devised a humanist service \u201cfull of fun and humour\u201d for her husband, Arthur, who died aged 86 last July after a lifetime as a magician and children\u2019s entertainer for which he dressed as a clown. \u201cThe undertakers all wore red noses and at the end a traditional magician\u2019s ritual was performed in which a wand is broken indicating that it is no longer needed as the person has passed away,\u201d said Perry, of Polegate, East Sussex. \u201cIt was a day to remember and I am very glad I did it this way as it summed up Arthur\u2019s humour and personality.\u201d Other alternative funerals included a fancy-dress theme, \u2013 with the funeral director dressed as a He-Man and guests including Elvis Presley, Red Riding Hood and a ninja turtle \u2013 and an Only Fools and Horses send-off for a comedy enthusiast featuring a Reliant Regal hearse. \u201cWe all lead unique lives and our final goodbye should definitely reflect that,\u201d said David Collingwood, the Co-op\u2019s director of funerals. \u201cPersonalised touches don\u2019t need to be extravagant \u2013 it can be something as small as changing the funeral directing team\u2019s ties.\u201d Meanwhile, specialist transport companies have also stepped into the breach by offering unusual options.

Co-op Funeralcare conducts almost 100,000 funerals every year for more than 1,000 regional funeral homes. The industry is under investigation by the Competitions and Markets Authority (CMA) to see if people are being charged too much when they lay their loved ones to rest. The competition watchdog is looking at the rate at which funeral directors have raised prices in recent years and whether the information on prices and services is too confusing for people to be able to choose the best option. No-frills cremations \u2013 as chosen by the late singer and musician David Bowie \u2013 are also rising in popularity as an alternative to traditional services. The Co-op launched a no-frills service last year, while Simplicity Cremations (the direct cremation arm of publicly listed company Dignity) launched a new cremation package in October last year, to provide families with all the practical and essential elements of a cremation without expensive ceremonial extras.",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn is likely to refrain from making fresh moves towards backing a second referendum until after the government\u2019s Brexit plan B is voted on later this month, as he seeks to balance pressure from rival wings of his party. Labour strategists believe there is a firm majority both in the shadow cabinet and in parliament against an immediate shift towards full-throated support for a referendum, the Guardian understands. They are also keen for the focus in the coming days to remain on Theresa May\u2019s efforts to rework the Irish backstop, after her Brexit deal was defeated by a historic margin of 230 votes last week. Labour wants to prioritise pursuing its own version of Brexit \u2013 with a customs union, a close relationship to the single market, and stronger protections for workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards. The prime minister is due to table a motion on Monday setting out the next steps in the Brexit process, which is set to be voted on by MPs on 29 January. If an amendment calling for a people\u2019s vote is tabled, Labour would not whip MPs to vote against it \u2013 but has not yet committed to whipping them to support it, either. Corbyn is also likely to table his own amendment, setting out Labour\u2019s plans for a reworked Brexit deal. Labour could also support some of the backbench efforts to find a compromise that can win majority backing in parliament. Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, said: \u201cI think a second referendum is a part of our armoury. It\u2019s there in the party conference resolution; it\u2019s something that we see as part of the toolkit in order to ensure that we get the kind of Brexit that can bring the 52% and the 48% back together.\u201d Together with close Corbyn allies Jon Trickett, Richard Burgon and Ian Lavery, Gardiner is among those in the shadow cabinet who are less enthusiastic about the party pivoting immediately to wholehearted support for a referendum. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, appeared keen to push Labour\u2019s policy in that direction in a carefully worded speech on Saturday, and some shadow cabinet colleagues believe he is positioning himself as the champion of a people\u2019s vote. The \u201ccomposite motion\u201d hammered out at party conference states that if Labour cannot secure a general election, \u201cLabour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote\u201d. Starmer said Labour was in the \u201cthird phase\u201d of the conference motion \u2013 after voting against the government\u2019s deal, and trying to force a general election with a vote of no confidence. He told an audience in London that left only two options: a Labour-style Brexit deal, which would involve \u201ctradeoffs and compromises\u201d; or a public vote. He built on the comments on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, saying that in the event of a second referendum \u201cI will campaign for in and I will vote for in\u201d. Starmer also acknowledged that any deal hammered out at this stage was likely to have to include a backstop \u2013 though Labour later insisted that did not mean the party could sign up to May\u2019s withdrawal agreement. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, is also widely believed to be more warmly disposed to the idea of a referendum than some shadow cabinet colleagues. The MP David Lammy warned on Sunday that some Labour MPs could leave the party if it does not swing its weight behind another referendum. He accused Corbyn of \u201cmoving the goalposts\u201d after the failure of last week\u2019s vote of no confidence. \u201cI think we have an open goal here and I would like the Labour party to go through the door and score the goal,\u201d he told Sky News. Rival groups of Labour MPs are canvassing support for alternative options that could come to the fore in the days ahead. Backers of a Norway-style \u201csingle market 2.0\u201d claim that at least 75 Labour MPs are firmly opposed to a referendum and prefer a softer Brexit; while people\u2019s vote campaigners say they have two-thirds of the party\u2019s 256 MPs on board. Labour strategists accept that support for a referendum is likely to increase as the risk of a no-deal Brexit is heightened in the run-up to the article 50 deadline on 29 March. A series of shadow cabinet ministers will visit leave-voting constituencies on Monday, in a bid to underlined Labour\u2019s determination not to retreat to just representing \u201cremoania\u201d, as some party figures call it. They will criticise the government\u2019s spending on no-deal planning, saying the \u00a31.5bn allocated for this year alone could go instead to other public spending priorities. Corbyn said he was ready to talk to May, but not while she is engaged in what he called \u201cdangerous and unnecessary no-deal brinkmanship\u201d. \u201cMay\u2019s no deal threat is empty and hugely expensive, wasting billions of pounds we should be spending on vital public services.
