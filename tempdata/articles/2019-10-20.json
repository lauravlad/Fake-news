We\u2019ll have a full story on that launching soon, but in the meantime, here are a few key points from Rowena Mason:</p> \n  <p>\u2022 Around eight Labour MPs are likely to back the deal. On Sunday, Lucy Powell suggested that she could be one of that group, telling Sky News: \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have voted for it if we had had a straight up and down vote on it over the weekend but I do think now that we\u2019ve got to move forward.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u2022 No 10 claims that several more Labour MPs could follow.</p> \n  <p>\u2022 Around 20 former Tories who lost the whip or left the party voluntarily are expected to support the prime minister.</p> \n  <p>\u2022 The support of Lady Sylvia Hermon, the independent unionist MP, appears to be in doubt. During the debate in the House of Commons on Saturday she demanded a \u201cguarantee that there is nothing in this deal.. which undermines or weakens the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.\u201d</p> \n  <p>On these numbers, it would take just two MPs changing their minds to change the result.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/vote_for_a_deal_waffle/giv-3902yFfsgwr9IFAM/\" data-alt=\"Estimated votes for and against Boris Johnson's deal.\"> \n   <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/vote_for_a_deal_waffle/giv-3902yFfsgwr9IFAM/\">Estimated votes for and against Boris Johnson's deal.</a> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-20T18:07:24.105Z\">at 7.07pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dac9e198f08142786c4f5f2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-20T17:52:08.501Z\">6.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>All is not well at the People\u2019s Vote campaign, Rowena Mason reports: clashes between PR guru Roland Rudd and Labour peer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/peter-mandelson\">Peter Mandelson</a> have sent the organisation into crisis just as the prospect of testing MPs\u2019 support for a second referendum becomes a reality.</p> \n  <p>Alastair Campbell\u2019s involved, too, as a leak to the Mail on Sunday showed:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>The emails suggested Mandelson and Alastair Campbell, another former New Labour communications adviser, had been attempting to work together against Rudd earlier this year.

He told the Commons on Saturday: \u201cI will not negotiate a delay with the EU, and neither does the law compel me to do so.\u201d </p> \n  <p>But he did eventually send two letters to the European council president, <strong>Donald Tusk</strong>. There was an unsigned photocopy of the request he was obliged to send under the Benn act, followed by a letter explaining why the government did not actually want an extension.

Letwin, who lost the Tory whip for voting against the government on Brexit previously, said the amendment was \u201cinsurance\u201d against the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal by mistake on the scheduled deadline of 31 October. After he lost the vote, the prime minister decided not to have the so-called \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on his deal. </p> \n  <p><strong>When will Johnson next try to get his Brexit deal through parliament? </strong></p> \n  <p>The government is set to bring the withdrawal agreement bill \u2013 the legislation needed for Brexit \u2013 to the Commons this coming week. However, time is running out to beat the 31 October deadline because the European parliament would also need to ratify it. Ministers could try to hold additional sittings to get the legislation through.</p> \n  <p>The Commons leader, <strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg</strong>,<strong> </strong>said the government wanted to hold another meaningful vote on Johnson\u2019s deal on Monday and would make an emergency business statement to achieve this.

      "bodyText": "Our crack visuals unit has worked up this graphic showing estimated votes for and against Johnson\u2019s deal, based on a Guardian analysis of MPs\u2019 likely intentions - and while ministers insist they have the numbers, it\u2019s clear that it remains agonisingly close. We\u2019ll have a full story on that launching soon, but in the meantime, here are a few key points from Rowena Mason: \u2022 Around eight Labour MPs are likely to back the deal. On Sunday, Lucy Powell suggested that she could be one of that group, telling Sky News: \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have voted for it if we had had a straight up and down vote on it over the weekend but I do think now that we\u2019ve got to move forward.\u201d \u2022 No 10 claims that several more Labour MPs could follow. \u2022 Around 20 former Tories who lost the whip or left the party voluntarily are expected to support the prime minister. \u2022 The support of Lady Sylvia Hermon, the independent unionist MP, appears to be in doubt. During the debate in the House of Commons on Saturday she demanded a \u201cguarantee that there is nothing in this deal.. which undermines or weakens the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.\u201d On these numbers, it would take just two MPs changing their minds to change the result. All is not well at the People\u2019s Vote campaign, Rowena Mason reports: clashes between PR guru Roland Rudd and Labour peer Peter Mandelson have sent the organisation into crisis just as the prospect of testing MPs\u2019 support for a second referendum becomes a reality. Alastair Campbell\u2019s involved, too, as a leak to the Mail on Sunday showed: The emails suggested Mandelson and Alastair Campbell, another former New Labour communications adviser, had been attempting to work together against Rudd earlier this year. In one email, Campbell said: \u201cI do not see how this gets done without a public battle and it should happen soon and be fast and brutal.\u201d You can read the story here: Of the six Labour MPs who voted against the Letwin amendment on Saturday, only Caroline Flint is not standing down. Helen Pidd went to her firmly leave-supporting constituency, Don Valley, to find out what her constituents think, and found that they remain firmly in her corner. 75-year-old Bob Davis, for example, said: I think she\u2019s wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. She has listened to her constituents, it\u2019s as simple as that... It would be an insult to me to run a second referendum. I believe strongly in democracy.\u201d You can read the whole piece here: - The government is to seek a meaningful vote in the Commons on its Brexit deal on Monday. - Michael Gove has disclosed the government\u2019s Operation Yellowhammer contingency plan to handle a no-deal Brexit is being triggered. - Gove says the risk of the UK leaving the EU without a deal has grown as a result of yesterday\u2019s vote but believes Brexit will happen on 31 October. - Labour will back an amendment next week calling for a referendum on Johnson\u2019s deal, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said. - John McDonnell said Johnson behaved \u201ca bit like a spoilt brat\u201d after the prime minister sent an unsigned letter to the EU asking for a delay, and then a second arguing against it. A key player in Britain\u2019s first involvement in the European Union has called for a second Brexit referendum after attending his first protest at the age of 91. Uwe Kitzinger worked as an adviser to Winston Churchill\u2019s son-in-law Christopher Soames from 1973 to 1975, when Lord Soames became the first British vice-president of the European commission. Kitzinger attended the People\u2019s Vote march in London on Saturday and believes the public are now better informed to make a choice. \u201cI do not see how the question of sovereignty over the issue of Europe can be settled without the people of this country having a say, now that they are much better informed, and now that there is actually a proposal,\u201d he told PA. \u201cWe now see the beginnings of a transition to a destination, but it\u2019s very clear that the destination is meant to be one of national tribalism, and that is the beginning of the kind of international tensions which can so easily lead to war. \u201cIt is the negation of all I stood for and all I worked for in my career, but that isn\u2019t the important thing. \u201cThe important thing is what happens to my grandchildren, and their children.\u201d Boris Johnson faces another rollercoaster week in the Commons after insisting the UK will still leave the EU in 11 days\u2019 time. Despite being forced by parliament to request a Brexit delay from Brussels, ministers talked up their chances of rushing Brexit legislation through the Commons. A potential new government showdown with the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, looms on Monday when he will rule on whether the prime minister can hold a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on his Brexit deal. Johnson abandoned plans for such a move on a special Saturday sitting of the Commons after suffering an embarrassing defeat at the hands of the former minister Sir Oliver Letwin. Labour is planning to try to hijack the prime minister\u2019s Brexit legislation when he presents it to MPs by tabling amendments demanding a new referendum and customs union with the EU. The Shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, indicated Labour could even support the withdrawal agreement bill if a new national poll on it is backed by MPs. Jeremy Corbyn speaking in Liverpool on Saturday night. Alliance MLAs will not go to the Stormont recall sitting on Monday Jo Swinson has described breaking up the United Kingdom, if Scotland was to vote for independence, as \u201cmuch more difficult than what we\u2019re experiencing with Brexit\u201d. The Liberal Democrat leader said it was a lesson she had learned throughout the process of Britain\u2019s attempt to leave the EU since June 2016. Speaking on radio programme Scotland\u2019s Talk In, the East Dunbartonshire MP said she was the only party leader campaigning to keep Scotland in the UK and the UK in the EU. Last week at the SNP\u2019s conference in Aberdeen, Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said a second independence referendum north of the border \u201cmust happen next year\u201d. But Swinson said: \u201cI want the UK to stay in the European Union, that\u2019s what I\u2019m working for and I believe that\u2019s still possible. I believe we can still do that and I\u2019m not giving up on that cause because I think we\u2019re better off having Scotland in the UK and the UK in the EU.\u201d Here is the link to the Commons order paper outlining Monday\u2019s agenda: https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201920/cmagenda/LargeP_OP191021.pdf The order paper for Monday confirms the government will seek a meaningful vote on its Brexit deal again, as announced by Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, on Saturday. However, the Speaker of the Commons may disallow this because the government already had one attempt at getting the motion through on Saturday, when it was amended by parliament to prevent it from being a meaningful vote. This meant that the Benn act was triggered and Boris Johnson had to write to the EU requesting an extension to article 50. How would any future \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 on the PM\u2019s Brexit deal work? Opposition MPs are likely to put forward amendments to any government motion to approve Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, and Bercow has suggested \u201cmanuscript\u201d amendments submitted on the day itself could be accepted. Opposition MPs have indicated they would seek to amend the deal to try to \u201cshape\u201d Brexit. This is likely to include trying to hold a second EU referendum, securing a future customs union or inserting safeguards on workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections. Losing another meaningful vote on the deal could lead to the PM facing an opposition motion of no confidence, paving the way for a general election and further clouding the precise future of the Brexit process. Has Johnson sent a letter to Brussels seeking a Brexit delay? Under the terms of the so-called Benn act, which was passed against the PM\u2019s wishes, Johnson was compelled to write to the EU asking for a three-month Brexit extension if he had not secured a deal by 11pm UK time on 19 October. He told the Commons on Saturday: \u201cI will not negotiate a delay with the EU, and neither does the law compel me to do so.\u201d But he did eventually send two letters to the European council president, Donald Tusk. There was an unsigned photocopy of the request he was obliged to send under the Benn act, followed by a letter explaining why the government did not actually want an extension. There was also an explanatory letter from Sir Tim Barrow, the UK\u2019s ambassador to the EU, which was sent to Jeppe Tranholm-Mikkelsen, the secretary general of the Council of the European Union. Will the EU agree to an extension? Despite the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, raising doubts over the likelihood of another Brexit delay, that decision needs to be taken by all 27 remaining EU states. The EU could set a different length to an extension, either shorter or longer than the three-month one cited in the Benn act. The EU could decide not to formally respond to the PM\u2019s letter until it sees if Johnson can get the withdrawal agreement bill through parliament this week. If the PM gets the cill through, there could be a special gathering of EU leaders on 28 October. If the deal needs more time at that stage to get through parliament, leaders could agree to a short \u201ctechnical\u201d extension. Here\u2019s a helpful Q&amp;A from the Press Association on the state of play: Why did a \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 on Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal not go ahead on Saturday? MPs voted by a majority of 16 to back an amendment put forward by the former cabinet minister Oliver Letwin to withhold approval of the latest deal agreed between Johnson and Brussels \u201cunless and until implementing legislation is passed\u201d. Letwin, who lost the Tory whip for voting against the government on Brexit previously, said the amendment was \u201cinsurance\u201d against the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal by mistake on the scheduled deadline of 31 October. After he lost the vote, the prime minister decided not to have the so-called \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on his deal. When will Johnson next try to get his Brexit deal through parliament? The government is set to bring the withdrawal agreement bill \u2013 the legislation needed for Brexit \u2013 to the Commons this coming week. However, time is running out to beat the 31 October deadline because the European parliament would also need to ratify it. Ministers could try to hold additional sittings to get the legislation through. The Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said the government wanted to hold another meaningful vote on Johnson\u2019s deal on Monday and would make an emergency business statement to achieve this. The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, said he would consider whether to allow the government\u2019s plans. Does Johnson have the numbers to achieve a Commons majority for his Brexit deal? In the current hung parliament, much will hinge on the PM securing support from pro-Brexit Tories who voted down Theresa May\u2019s deal on three occasions, plus the 21 former Conservatives who lost the whip over the issue of a no-deal Brexit. The former Tory cabinet minister Amber Rudd has indicated she will support Johnson\u2019s deal and thinks there is a \u201ccoalition for getting the prime minister\u2019s deal through\u201d. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said he believed the government had enough backing, telling the Andrew Marr Show: \u201cWe seem to have the numbers in the House of Commons.\u201d The DUP is strongly opposed to Johnson\u2019s deal due to the arrangements for Northern Ireland, so the backing of enough Labour MPs in leave-supporting seats will also be vital. Moving away from Brexit, Boris Johnson has held telephone talks with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, about the situation in Syria. Johnson expressed concern over Turkey\u2019s military action in the north of the country, Downing Street said. The two leaders are looking to hold discussions with Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel and France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron on the situation, as well as issues including migration and terrorism. A Downing Street spokesman said: \u201cThe prime minister welcomed the agreement between the US and Turkey on the temporary suspension of fighting, which he said was a step in the right direction. He hoped that the agreement would hold and minimise further casualties on all sides. \u201cBut he also underlined that there remains a great deal of concern about Turkey\u2019s military operation in north-east Syria. The prime minister and the president agreed to look for an opportunity to meet alongside President Macron and Chancellor Merkel to discuss the current situation as well as broader issues including counter-terrorism and migration.\u201d As he emerged from a \u201cshort and normal\u201d meeting with EU ambassadors in Brussels this morning, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, joked with reporters, saying: \u201cYou are very patient,\u201d and adding \u201cMe too, me too.\u201d Barnier said he was taking the next step on ratifying the deal struck with the UK and would update the European parliament tomorrow. He said the request for a three0month Brexit delay was a matter for Donald Tusk, the EU council\u2019s president, and would be dealt with \u201cin the next few days\u201d. The extension was not discussed by ambassadors today. Deciding whether to delay Brexit and avoid no deal is a decision for EU leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s above my pay grade,\u201d one ambassador told ITV News. The EU will wait until the Brexit deal comes up in front of MPs on Tuesday before making decisions on the terms of a further extension. With MPs likely to vote on a series of amendments to the deal including a confirmatory referendum, Brussels is reluctant to be dragged into the political drama in Westminster. EU ambassadors agreed this morning that the withdrawal agreement would be sent to the European parliament on Monday. MEPs could vote on it on Thursday if the Commons has given its approval. Michael Gove has disclosed that the government\u2019s Operation Yellowhammer contingency plan to handle a no-deal Brexit is being triggered. The chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who is in charge of preparations for a no-deal outcome, said the risk of such a scenario had increased due to MPs forcing the government to ask Brussels for another delay to the Brexit date. Some Westminster observers viewed the move as an attempt to increase the pressure on MPs to back Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. Gove told Sky News: \u201cThe risk of leaving without a deal has actually increased because we cannot guarantee that the European council will grant an extension. And that is why I will, later today, be chairing a cabinet committee meeting, extraordinarily on a Sunday, in order to ensure that the next stage of our exit preparations and our preparedness for no deal is accelerated. \u201cIt means that we are triggering Operation Yellowhammer. It means that we are preparing to ensure that if no extension is granted, we have done everything possible in order to prepare to leave without a deal.\u201d The DUP MP Sammy Wilson on supporting the Letwin amendment and the party\u2019s position. Asked if the EU would be open to an extension, Michel Barnier told reporters that the European council president, Donald Tusk, would consider the next stage. Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said there had been a \u201cvery short and normal meeting\u201d of EU ambassadors this morning to take the next steps to ratify the withdrawal agreement. \u201cTomorrow I will await the European parliament,\u201d he said. The Mail on Sunday\u2019s Harry Cole on the current state of parliament: The Scottish Conservative MP Luke Graham has insisted a no-deal Brexit is what the party has been trying to avoid all along. \u201cWhat we saw in the last week is the prime minister actually deliver a deal that delivers on a lot of the objectives that we were trying to achieve as a country,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Sunday Politics Scotland programme. \u201cThere\u2019s less discussion about no deal, it\u2019s a discussion about we\u2019ve got a deal, the EU have agreed it, it\u2019s now for us to agree it as well. \u201cThe prime minister has written his letters in accordance with the law and now we\u2019re focusing on getting a deal. \u201cWe\u2019ve got one on the table and it\u2019s time for MPs right across the House of Commons to come together and actually vote for that deal so we can move forward.\u201d Sir Oliver Letwin says he is \u201cabsolutely behind the government now\u201d and will back Boris Johnson\u2019s deal as amended. He tabled an amendment on Saturday to prevent an unintended no-deal Brexit. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has clarified the position on goods moving from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland. He told the Andrew Marr Show: \u201cIf it\u2019s going into the EU then it ought to be able to take place without any extra frictions or any extra tariffs. If it\u2019s going into other parts of the world then you have to look at the arrangements either the EU has that we accede to, or the new arrangements that the UK puts in place.\u201d Raab added the EU would not allow the UK to \u201ccherry pick\u201d the same arrangements that had been given to Northern Ireland. \u201cThis is only being offered in relation to Northern Ireland because of the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland.\u201d Our Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u2019Carroll on the DUP\u2019s position Some interesting polling in the Sunday Times Scotland this morning found that Scottish voters would prefer the SNP to be pushing for a second EU referendum before another election. The Panelbase poll taken between before SNP conference last weekend \u2013 during which there was a great deal more discussion of a second referendum on independence than on EU membership \u2013 found that only 26% supported the election-first stance, while 46% would prefer another referendum. And among SNP voters, six out of 10 would prefer the priority to be another vote on Brexit. The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has confirmed the party will bring a vote of no confidence in the prime minister, potentially later in the week. Blackford told the BBC\u2019s Sunday Politics Scotland programme: \u201cWe are prepared, once we\u2019ve got that extension in place, to take our responsibilities and move a motion of no confidence and I would be looking for parliamentary time to do that and I would expect everyone else to step up.\u201d He said Boris Johnson\u2019s behaviour in sending multiple letters to the EU last night proved he was \u201cnot treating the office with any respect or dignity\u201d. Blackford would not be drawn on what court action might follow from the weekend \u2013 the SNP MP Joanna Cherry\u2019s ongoing case regarding the PM\u2019s compliance with the Benn act still has court time reserved for this Monday \u2013 but he said he would \u201cstrongly suspect we may see action taking place at the courts in the coming days\u201d. He restated that the SNP would support a confirmatory referendum, but added: \u201cIf we are going to move forward to people\u2019s vote then we do need a government in place to support that, we need a general election too.\u201d Keir Starmer believes the prime minister has taken a \u201csilly approach\u201d to the Benn act and has accused him of being \u201cchildlike\u201d. Following yesterday\u2019s Commons defeat, Boris Johnson called on EU leaders to reject any extension of Britain\u2019s membership of the EU. Starmer told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show: \u201cThe law is very clear. He should have signed one letter in accordance with the law. If we crash out because of what he has done with the letters [...] without a deal, he bears personal responsibility for that.\u201d He added that Labour would be open to talking to the DUP following their opposition to Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. He said: \u201cI would openly invite the DUP to talk to us. If you want to work with us to improve the situation we\u2019re in, our door is open to that discussion.\u201d Labour will back an amendment next week calling for a referendum on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, has said. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has insisted a Conservative government would work to protect workers\u2019 rights after Brexit. He said British businesses and workers need \u201ca set of regulations that is smarter and tailored towards them\u201d. \u201cWorkers are far safer under a Conservative government, given our economic record and the protections we\u2019re putting in place, than they are under this shower of a Labour party,\u201d Raab told the Andrew Marr Show. Asked why the \u201clevel playing field\u201d for workers\u2019 regulation had been taken out of the legally binding withdrawal agreement and put into the non-legally binding political declaration, Raab responded: \u201cWe\u2019re basically saying these issues of employment rights, environmental protections, are so important, and the circumstances in the UK are obviously different. \u201cWe actually should make sure politicians are accountable to the voters watching the show. Why would you abdicate responsibility for those issues if they\u2019re so important?\u201d Michael Gove has said the risk of the UK leaving the EU without a deal has grown as a result of yesterday\u2019s vote. Reasserting the government\u2019s belief that Brexit will definitely happen on October 31, the cabinet minister told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u201cThe risk of leaving without a deal has actually increased because we cannot guarantee that the European council will grant an extension.\u201d He said he would chair a cabinet meeting later today in order to trigger Operation Yellowhammer, the government\u2019s contingency plan to prepare for a possible no-deal outcome. \u201cWe\u2019re preparing to ensure that if no extension is granted that we have done everything possible in order to leave without a deal,\u201d said Gove. Although the prime minister has already been forced to send a letter requesting a further Brexit delay, Gove insisted that \u201cparliament can\u2019t change the determination\u201d of the government to leave the EU by Halloween. \u201cWe know that the European Union want us to leave, we know that we have a deal that allows us to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to leave on October 31st. We have the means and ability to do so.\u201d He said he was optimistic that the government would get enough votes in order to get Boris Johnson\u2019s deal through the Commons \u2013 in which case there would be no extension. The former Tory minister Amber Rudd has said she feels Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal was better than the one currently being offered by Johnson. Speaking to Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge, Rudd, now an independent, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s as good as Theresa May\u2019s deal. I regret the fact that we don\u2019t have effectively a backstop for the whole of the country. Instead it\u2019s only Northern Ireland. \u201cIn terms of the economy, it\u2019s very good for Northern Ireland but it\u2019s less good for the union. I thought that Theresa May\u2019s deal was the right deal. I think this is not as good.\u201d However, Rudd stressed that she still supported Johnson\u2019s deal. \u201cWe have to make sure that we don\u2019t leave with no deal \u2026 I want to support it and I will, and I think, not all of us, but most of us former Conservatives, who supported the Letwin amendment will do so as well,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely right to say we don\u2019t want to leave with no deal but we do want to leave with a deal and this deal from the prime minister is good enough for me.\u201d The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, has also been talking to Sophy Ridge this morning. After being mocked on Thursday for his seeming own-goal in defending the law that would delay Brexit, Farage reaffirmed to the Sky presenter that he would rather have a Brexit extension followed by a general election than see Boris Johnson\u2019s deal being passed in the Commons. \u201cI want to leave on the 31st October with a clean-break Brexit because that\u2019s the only Brexit worth having,\u201d he said. \u201cI want a general election, so an extension for a few weeks in which we can have a general election is a much better outcome than signing up to a treaty that becomes part of international law that binds us in foreign policy and in many, many other areas.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are going to have to be on a level playing field with the rest of Europe, which means we still haven\u2019t taken back control of our laws. This is not Brexit.\u201d He described Johnson\u2019s deal as \u201ca new EU treaty\u201d, adding that \u201call it does is take us on to the next stage of negotiations\u201d. Our video team were at the huge People\u2019s Vote march in London yesterday, following some of the estimated one million anti-Brexit protesters as they demanded a fresh referendum. You can watch their work here: John McDonnell has said Boris Johnson has behaved \u201ca bit like a spoilt brat\u201d after the prime minister sent an unsigned letter to the EU asking for a delay, and then a second arguing against it. Speaking to Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on her Sunday show, the shadow chancellor said: \u201cHe may well be in contempt of parliament or the courts themselves. Parliament made a decision, he should abide by it, and this idea that you send another letter contradicting the first, I think it flies in the face of what the parliament and the courts have decided.\u201d He added that another meaningful vote on Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal would be \u201cpointless\u201d until MPs had been able to scrutinise the legislation needed to implement it. \u201cUntil you see the legislation, you don\u2019t know the detail, and as someone said yesterday, the devil is in the detail,\u201d McDonnell said. While he said an amendment for a second referendum on Brexit would \u201calmost inevitably\u201d come up in parliament over the next few days, McDonnell would not confirm whether Labour would bring one forward, instead emphasising that the party would argue for a general election. \u201cIn a general election we would negotiate a sensible option for Brexit and we\u2019d take that back to the people,\u201d he said. Morning, it\u2019s Amy Walker here. I\u2019ll be kicking off the live blog today. The Sunday papers worked late into last night reacting to Boris Johnson\u2019s defeat in the Commons yesterday. The Observer carried a picture of the People\u2019s Vote march alongside news of the prime minister\u2019s \u201chumiliating defeat\u201d. The Mirror took a similar approach, declaring that \u201cBlustering Boris\u201d had been \u201cbeaten again\u201d. Meanwhile, others, such as the Sunday Times, painted a picture of a dedicated leader battling the \u201cBrexit wreckers\u201d. The Mail on Sunday described MPs who had helped to delay Johnson\u2019s deal as the \u201cHouse of Fools\u201d and the Sunday Express asked \u201cWhy Won\u2019t They Let Us Leave?\u201d. As yet another turbulent day gets under way, I\u2019ll be keeping you updated with what ministers and MPs are saying on the Sunday politics shows. First up is Sophy Ridge on Sky News, who is scheduled to interview John McDonnell, Nigel Farage, Amber Rudd and Michael Gove among others.",

      "bodyText": "It is sickening to think that Labour \u201crebels\u201d are prepared to vote to wreck the country\u2019s future \u2013 and in doing so hand a general election victory to the most rightwing Tory government in a generation \u2013 simply in order to indulge the opinions of their leave-voting constituents, many of whom will not even have been Labour voters (Defiant Labour MP Melanie Onn declares intention to vote for deal, 19 October). As Edmund Burke wisely put it in 1774: \u201cYour representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.\u201d Surely they must see that the need to strive for a progressive and inclusive UK, at the heart of Europe, is more important than the gratification of their consciences? No one is asking them to stop Brexit \u2013 merely to pause its headlong progress until a path can be found to ask the electorate whether or not they really want to live in a nation committed to the re-enactment of an imaginary past. Rob Sykes Oxford \u2022 Melanie Onn believes she should \u201cget back to helping \u2026 constituents\u201d by voting for the deal. As a Labour party member and one of her constituents I am saddened and angry and believe she is wrong. Owen Jones (Journal, 17 October) and Gordon Brown (Journal, 18 October) gave more than enough reasons for her to vote against the deal. As Keir Starmer told Andrew Marr on BBC1 on Sunday, \u201cYou cannot trust this government.\u201d At a time when Labour has the most exciting policies since 1945, she needs to do the right thing and vote against the deal. Martin Pask Grimsby, Lincolnshire \u2022 In the Saturday sitting of the House of Commons, it was shocking and horrifying how frequently those in favour of Brexit but not in favour of another referendum invoked the idea of what the people of the UK want. This is sheer hypocrisy. All ministers who have any real interest in the current view of the nation as a whole should obviously back a second referendum. Impressionistic ideas of what \u201cmy constituents\u201d might think, or extrapolations from the 2016 referendum, will simply not do. Our name should not be taken in vain, and it is particularly offensive for this to happen allegedly in the name of \u201cdemocracy\u201d. The most recent indication of what the people want was the petition to revoke article 50. Simon Brodbeck Cardiff \u2022 According to a report in Sunday\u2019s Observer, a recent Opinium poll shows only 42% of voters want a second referendum while 43% oppose it. So that\u2019s another expression of democratic opinion the remainers will have to disregard. Christopher Clayton Waverton, Cheshire \u2022 Yet again our incompetent prime minister has lost a key vote and now, in an act of breathtaking hypocrisy, is attempting to frustrate the will of parliament by accompanying his unsigned letter to Brussels requesting a Brexit extension with a second letter, signed by him, saying that he believes a delay would be a mistake. This surely constitutes a clear case of contempt of parliament. Dr Chris Newall Ealing, London \u2022 With his three letters ploy, Boris has just shot himself in the foot, possibly both feet, by proving to the EU leaders that he cannot be trusted with regard to anything he says. Chris Burrell Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire \u2022 I can\u2019t help but notice that the prime minister, for all his expensive education and patrician manner, has added to our national humiliation by introducing an unnecessary and incorrect apostrophe into the penultimate sentence of the penultimate paragraph of the letter that he signed, where he refers to \u201cour long history as neighbours and friends in this continent our people\u2019s [sic] share\u201d, turning a simple plural into a possessive. I can only hope that the EU leaders will come to the conclusion that this second letter, so illiterately expressed, must be a hoax and dismiss it out of hand.

      "bodyText": "Jonathan Freedland\u2019s articulation and understanding of the feelings and emotions of remainers over the last three years are very welcome (For years we\u2019ve held our breath. Today remainer dreams may die, Journal, 19 October); we have felt excluded from \u201cthe people whose will must be done\u201d and there is an impending sense of loss at the prospect of being outside the EU, which is barely acknowledged or recognised by Brexiteers. The narrative in the media has all been about their anger and sense of betrayal, with hardly any reference to the feelings of those of us who voted to remain. Andy Beckett (Journal, 19 October) is correct in his analysis that the campaign to stop Brexit has never found the right words \u2013 what a pity that no politician has been as eloquent in defence of the ideal of cooperation across borders as Jonathan Freedland. Perhaps, then, we would not be in the situation that we are in today. Katarina Tidball Ringwood, Hampshire \u2022 I entirely agree with Andy Beckett that the stop Brexit campaign has had by far the better of the arguments, but has never had the persuasive slogans to win over the country. I believe a very simple line should have been taken immediately following the referendum to reflect the size of the leave vote as a percentage of the electorate: \u201c37% is not enough\u201d would have been a simple response to all the bluff about the so-called people\u2019s vote and a rejoinder to every claim that leave was the decision of a majority. Sadly, it is now too late. Robert Nelson London \u2022 With reference to the People\u2019s Vote march in London on Saturday, for every visible person taking part there will have been many who, like my partner and me, could not be present due to various reasons such as health or commitments. As veteran demonstrators in our 70s, it frustrates us deeply that we cannot be counted among those who are trying to pluck this country back from the brink of disaster. All we can do is sign petitions and write to our MP, both of which seem to be ignored. No doubt letters to the media are equally futile, but we cannot keep completely quiet. Please try to give us a voice, however unheard it may remain.

I believe strongly in democracy.\u201d</p> <p>Waiting for his children to finish swimming, Andrew Hampson, 42, said he too voted remain but thought the UK should now probably leave the EU. A former advertising executive who swapped his City job to move to Yorkshire and become a cabinet maker, he thought the remain lobby were still scaremongering. \u201cIt\u2019s like with the Y2k crisis,\u201d he said, referring to the experts who warned that a computer bug was projected to create havoc at the beginning of the year 2000. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a disaster.\u201d</p> <p>Yet he questioned exactly what Boris Johnson\u2019s deal really meant: \u201cI think he\u2019s left it purposefully vague.

      "bodyText": "Of the six Labour MPs who rebelled and voted with the government on Saturday, only one, Caroline Flint, is standing again in the next general election. But in her constituency of Don Valley, which she has represented for 22 years, that decision seems unlikely to be a costly one. Explaining her decision, Flint revealed a stark statistic: in the mining villages in this part of South Yorkshire, she wrote in the Sunday Times, 80% of voters backed leave in 2016 (over the whole constituency the figure was 68%). Parliament has not been listening to these people, she wrote: \u201cThe voices in our mining villages remain unheard, despite their support for Labour over many decades.\u201d In Denaby Main, the most deprived of all the pit villages in Don Valley, where a three-bed terrace can cost about \u00a380,000, Flint\u2019s move was warmly received by voters on both sides of the debate. At the Dearne Valley leisure centre, built on top of the colliery after it was filled in back in 1986, Bob Davis broke into superlatives at the mere mention of her name. \u201cI think she\u2019s wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. She has listened to her constituents, it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d said the 75-year-old, who set up his own engineering firm after his father forbade his son following him down the mine. Davis, who voted remain \u201cto keep my children happy\u201d, would vote out now: \u201cIt would be an insult to me to run a second referendum. I believe strongly in democracy.\u201d Waiting for his children to finish swimming, Andrew Hampson, 42, said he too voted remain but thought the UK should now probably leave the EU. A former advertising executive who swapped his City job to move to Yorkshire and become a cabinet maker, he thought the remain lobby were still scaremongering. \u201cIt\u2019s like with the Y2k crisis,\u201d he said, referring to the experts who warned that a computer bug was projected to create havoc at the beginning of the year 2000. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a disaster.\u201d Yet he questioned exactly what Boris Johnson\u2019s deal really meant: \u201cI think he\u2019s left it purposefully vague. I do worry what Boris has agreed and I think it\u2019s nowhere near what a lot of people wanted.\u201d Many people wanted a real change in immigration policy, he said, particularly in the former coalfields in the north of England: \u201cI know plenty of liberal Guardian readers who will disagree, but the only reason for having immigration is to keep labour costs down. Working people get castigated for saying that, but it\u2019s true.\u201d At the Lord Conyers pub in neighbouring Conisbrough, 32-year-old plasterer Martin Lawton said he voted leave, partly to regain border control. \u201cIt seems to have been quite easy for people to come in illegally and legally.

With MPs likely to vote on a series of amendments to the deal including a confirmatory referendum, Brussels is reluctant to be dragged into the political drama in Westminster. EU ambassadors agreed on Sunday morning that the withdrawal agreement would be sent to the European parliament on Monday. MEPs could vote on it on Thursday if the Commons has given its approval by then. The bloc\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said when leaving the Sunday morning meeting with ambassadors that the EU\u2019s ratification process was continuing as \u201cnormal\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Everything that could be done had been done to secure a victory for Boris Johnson on what had been billed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/19/brexit-amendments-mps-are-voting-on\" title=\"\">\u201cSuper Saturday\u201d</a>. He had come <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/17/boris-johnson-gets-deal-backslapping-brussels-eu-summit-brexit\" title=\"\">back from Brussels</a> with his so-called \u201cnew deal\u201d to the sound of the massed brass bands of the pro-Brexit media trumpeting praise for a \u201cstunning achievement\u201d/\u201cpersonal triumph\u201d/insert more sycophantic hyperbole here. Some European leaders tried to help him frame the choice before parliament as \u201cnew deal or no deal\u201d. Suggestions that the EU might not grant another extension to the withdrawal date were designed to spook MPs into voting yes for fear of hurling Britain into a crash-out Brexit.</p> \n<p>Cabinet ministers were deployed to \u201cman-mark\u201d any Conservative MP whose vote was doubtful. Heavy-breathing Tory whips said they were going to get \u201cmedieval\u201d with rebels. The self-styled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/16/could-boris-johnsons-brexit-deal-pass-through-parliament\" title=\"\">Tory Spartans</a>, who would have spat out the Johnson deal as treachery if it had been presented by Theresa May, had fallen into line. Some of them had begun to see the ridiculousness of being Brexiters who never actually vote for Brexit.</p> \n<p>Then there was the timetabling. To further ratchet up the pressure, the government staged the crackling drama of an \u201cemergency\u201d Saturday sitting of parliament, the first time that MPs had met at the weekend for nearly 40 years. This meant that everyone had an absurdly limited amount of time to get their heads around the latest tortuous iteration of Brexit. Concluding yesterday\u2019s debate on behalf of the government, Michael Gove declared: \u201cOur democracy is precious and this parliament is a special place.\u201d They had a funny way of showing this supposed reverence for democracy and parliament. MPs were being asked to make a decision with huge consequences less than 48 hours after the deal had been unveiled. Were you able to conduct a confidential survey, guaranteeing to parliamentarians that their responses would remain anonymous, it is my strong suspicion that well under half of them have actually read the legal text and the rewritten political declaration. The government\u2019s desperation to stampede parliament into signing off on the deal was further illustrated by its point-blank refusal to publish any analysis of its economic impact.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ee729836f4ebdb65baaa9b6069102532016d8df\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ee729836f4ebdb65baaa9b6069102532016d8df/0_107_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Letwin greets supporters in Whitehall after his amendment succeeded in the Commons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Letwin greets supporters in Whitehall after his amendment succeeded in the Commons.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Dawson/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>These tactics ultimately backfired. There was too much resistance to the attempt to bounce MPs into agreement. The debate was peppered with complaints that a prime minister who couldn\u2019t be trusted was seeking a blank cheque from a parliament being kept in the dark. Justine Greening, the former Tory cabinet minister, tellingly complained that this was like being asked to buy a house without being allowed to see it.</p> \n<p>By <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/oct/19/brexit-deal-how-did-your-mp-vote-on-the-letwin-amendment\" title=\"\">322 to 306</a>, a 16-vote defeat for Boris Johnson, MPs thwarted him by backing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/19/what-does-the-letwin-amendment-mean-for-brexit-timetable-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">Sir Oliver Letwin\u2019s amendment</a> to withhold approval of the deal until MPs have had the chance to properly scrutinise the withdrawal legislation. For the prime minister, so-called Super Saturday turned into Squelched Saturday.</p> \n<p>To understand why he was defeated, you first have to consider his deal. It bears no resemblance to the have-your-cake-and-eat-it promises peddled to the country by him and his fellow travellers during the referendum campaign in 2016. He succeeded in getting rid of the \u201cbackstop\u201d, the element of the old deal so aggravating to the Tory Brexit ultras, but at the cost of inserting a frontstop that will keep Northern Ireland largely aligned with the single market and customs union for at least five years. The creation of an economic border down the Irish Sea made it impossible for him to gain the support of the Democratic Unionists. The other major difference with Mrs May\u2019s deal is that it envisages moving to a much more distant relationship with Britain\u2019s most important trading partners. The Johnson deal is one of the rock-hardest forms of Brexit. That diminished his chances of attracting support from Labour MPs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"16661a61-0e0a-4275-86d6-8fa8192c8626\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A5auvTNciK8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In his speech to the Commons yesterday, the Tory leader said it was time to \u201cmove on\u201d, a mantra parroted ad nauseam from the benches behind him. But as some of the more clued-up MPs observed, his deal does not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/19/boris-johnson-implores-mps-to-get-brexit-done-in-super-saturday-session\" title=\"\">\u201cget Brexit done\u201d</a> at all. It covers only the divorce and a period of \u201ctransition\u201d. Where Britain ultimately lands is still hugely uncertain. It is merely the prelude to a tougher stretch of bargaining about the terms of trade, customs, tariffs and standards with the EU. These negotiations come with another deadline attached. The cliff edge moves to the end of 2020. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, put it wittily when she remarked that it was \u201ca bad deal with a backdoor to a no deal.\u201d</p> \n<p>The fundamental trouble with this deal is the same as with all the many versions of Brexit floated by two Tory prime minsters over the past three-plus years. None offers terms as favourable to the United Kingdom as remaining within the European Union. A study by the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank projects that the Johnson deal will <a href=\"https://ukandeu.ac.uk/johnsons-brexit-leaves-uk-economy-worse-off-than-mays/\" title=\"\">shave up to 7%</a> from the per capita income of Britons over a decade. Other forecasts are available. None of the credible ones suggests that Britain will be better off outside the EU.</p> \n<p>There were other reasons why Mr Johnson could not assemble the coalition of support that he needed. The 10 votes of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/18/dup-humiliated-westminster\" title=\"\">Democratic Unionists</a> played a decisive role in his defeat. They radiated the fury of people betrayed. Mr Johnson attended their party conference last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/18/remainers-boris-johnson-brexit\" title=\"\">to pledge that \u201cno British Conservative government</a> could or should sign up to\u201d regulatory checks and customs controls between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Now he is pushing a deal that does this very thing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5e94fc7e132bc3f8ad579efdd864db7c52b9c6c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5e94fc7e132bc3f8ad579efdd864db7c52b9c6c/0_324_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Justine Greening, the former Tory cabinet minister, tellingly complained that this was like being asked to buy a house without being allowed to see it.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Justine Greening, the former Tory cabinet minister, tellingly complained that this was like being asked to buy a house without being allowed to see it.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Without the DUP, it was always going to be a very hard scrabble for the government to command a majority in the Commons. Its hopes depended on convincing enough Labour MPs to vote with the Tories. There is a band of Labour MPs who have their reasons for wanting to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, but most had even more compelling reasons for not helping Mr Johnson to do it. He gave them less incentive to support him and more reason to distrust him by moving assurances on workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards out of the binding withdrawal agreement and into the non-binding political declaration. His behaviour in his 88 febrile days as prime minister made it yet harder for Labour MPs to lend him their support.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue\" title=\"\">unlawful prorogation of parliament</a> and the use of incendiary language to attack parliamentarians alienated some of the very Labour MPs he needed to persuade. The fact that it was a Johnson deal was a very big problem for them. The intense loathing he arouses among Labour people is much more visceral than their feelings about Theresa May. It is a very big step for a Labour MP to enable a Tory prime minister, especially when an election is looming. When that Tory prime minister is Boris Johnson, it proved just too much.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>'Those hoping to take the question back to the people have more time to convince parliament to embrace a fresh referendum.</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>In response to his defeat, the prime minister rose to the dispatch box, fixed a smile to his face and spoke as if, to use a phrase made notorious by his predecessor, \u201cnothing has changed\u201d. Of course, quite a lot has changed. By the time you read this, the government will have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/19/eu-will-grant-brexit-extension-if-johnson-sends-letter-says-brussels\" title=\"\">sent a letter</a> to the EU requesting an extension to the Brexit deadline, something Mr Johnson has repeatedly sworn he would never do, or he will be in breach of the law.</p> \n<p>His deal is not necessarily dead. He mustered 306 votes, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47752017\" title=\"\">20 more than Mrs May</a> ever got for her deal. This leaves him 14 short of what he needs for a majority. Some of the MPs who defied him over the Letwin amendment, including Sir Oliver himself, have said they will support the government when it comes to votes on the Brexit legislation. There\u2019s not much doubt, though, that the road ahead has become a great deal more rocky for Mr Johnson. Parliament will be able to seize the opportunity to subject his deal to the searching and detailed scrutiny that the government sought to evade yesterday. Pressure can be increased on ministers to reveal the true costs of the Johnson deal. Those hoping to take the question back to the people have more time to convince parliament to embrace a fresh referendum.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson called this special Saturday sitting in the hope that it would give him a reputation-boosting, momentum-building victory to flourish. He wanted to be able to claim that Brexit was done and dusted. Instead, Brexit is not done and he is dusted.</p> \n<p>Much is in flux after another \u201chistoric\u201d parliamentary vote that failed to settle Britain\u2019s future. One thing is certain. Our long national nightmare continues.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

He had come back from Brussels with his so-called \u201cnew deal\u201d to the sound of the massed brass bands of the pro-Brexit media trumpeting praise for a \u201cstunning achievement\u201d/\u201cpersonal triumph\u201d/insert more sycophantic hyperbole here. Some European leaders tried to help him frame the choice before parliament as \u201cnew deal or no deal\u201d. Suggestions that the EU might not grant another extension to the withdrawal date were designed to spook MPs into voting yes for fear of hurling Britain into a crash-out Brexit. Cabinet ministers were deployed to \u201cman-mark\u201d any Conservative MP whose vote was doubtful. Heavy-breathing Tory whips said they were going to get \u201cmedieval\u201d with rebels. The self-styled Tory Spartans, who would have spat out the Johnson deal as treachery if it had been presented by Theresa May, had fallen into line. Some of them had begun to see the ridiculousness of being Brexiters who never actually vote for Brexit. Then there was the timetabling. To further ratchet up the pressure, the government staged the crackling drama of an \u201cemergency\u201d Saturday sitting of parliament, the first time that MPs had met at the weekend for nearly 40 years. This meant that everyone had an absurdly limited amount of time to get their heads around the latest tortuous iteration of Brexit. Concluding yesterday\u2019s debate on behalf of the government, Michael Gove declared: \u201cOur democracy is precious and this parliament is a special place.\u201d They had a funny way of showing this supposed reverence for democracy and parliament. MPs were being asked to make a decision with huge consequences less than 48 hours after the deal had been unveiled. Were you able to conduct a confidential survey, guaranteeing to parliamentarians that their responses would remain anonymous, it is my strong suspicion that well under half of them have actually read the legal text and the rewritten political declaration. The government\u2019s desperation to stampede parliament into signing off on the deal was further illustrated by its point-blank refusal to publish any analysis of its economic impact. These tactics ultimately backfired. There was too much resistance to the attempt to bounce MPs into agreement. The debate was peppered with complaints that a prime minister who couldn\u2019t be trusted was seeking a blank cheque from a parliament being kept in the dark. Justine Greening, the former Tory cabinet minister, tellingly complained that this was like being asked to buy a house without being allowed to see it. By 322 to 306, a 16-vote defeat for Boris Johnson, MPs thwarted him by backing Sir Oliver Letwin\u2019s amendment to withhold approval of the deal until MPs have had the chance to properly scrutinise the withdrawal legislation. For the prime minister, so-called Super Saturday turned into Squelched Saturday. To understand why he was defeated, you first have to consider his deal. It bears no resemblance to the have-your-cake-and-eat-it promises peddled to the country by him and his fellow travellers during the referendum campaign in 2016. He succeeded in getting rid of the \u201cbackstop\u201d, the element of the old deal so aggravating to the Tory Brexit ultras, but at the cost of inserting a frontstop that will keep Northern Ireland largely aligned with the single market and customs union for at least five years. The creation of an economic border down the Irish Sea made it impossible for him to gain the support of the Democratic Unionists. The other major difference with Mrs May\u2019s deal is that it envisages moving to a much more distant relationship with Britain\u2019s most important trading partners. The Johnson deal is one of the rock-hardest forms of Brexit. That diminished his chances of attracting support from Labour MPs. In his speech to the Commons yesterday, the Tory leader said it was time to \u201cmove on\u201d, a mantra parroted ad nauseam from the benches behind him. But as some of the more clued-up MPs observed, his deal does not \u201cget Brexit done\u201d at all. It covers only the divorce and a period of \u201ctransition\u201d. Where Britain ultimately lands is still hugely uncertain. It is merely the prelude to a tougher stretch of bargaining about the terms of trade, customs, tariffs and standards with the EU. These negotiations come with another deadline attached. The cliff edge moves to the end of 2020. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, put it wittily when she remarked that it was \u201ca bad deal with a backdoor to a no deal.\u201d The fundamental trouble with this deal is the same as with all the many versions of Brexit floated by two Tory prime minsters over the past three-plus years. None offers terms as favourable to the United Kingdom as remaining within the European Union. A study by the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank projects that the Johnson deal will shave up to 7% from the per capita income of Britons over a decade. Other forecasts are available. None of the credible ones suggests that Britain will be better off outside the EU. There were other reasons why Mr Johnson could not assemble the coalition of support that he needed. The 10 votes of the Democratic Unionists played a decisive role in his defeat. They radiated the fury of people betrayed. Mr Johnson attended their party conference last year to pledge that \u201cno British Conservative government could or should sign up to\u201d regulatory checks and customs controls between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Now he is pushing a deal that does this very thing. Without the DUP, it was always going to be a very hard scrabble for the government to command a majority in the Commons. Its hopes depended on convincing enough Labour MPs to vote with the Tories. There is a band of Labour MPs who have their reasons for wanting to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, but most had even more compelling reasons for not helping Mr Johnson to do it. He gave them less incentive to support him and more reason to distrust him by moving assurances on workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards out of the binding withdrawal agreement and into the non-binding political declaration. His behaviour in his 88 febrile days as prime minister made it yet harder for Labour MPs to lend him their support. The unlawful prorogation of parliament and the use of incendiary language to attack parliamentarians alienated some of the very Labour MPs he needed to persuade. The fact that it was a Johnson deal was a very big problem for them. The intense loathing he arouses among Labour people is much more visceral than their feelings about Theresa May. It is a very big step for a Labour MP to enable a Tory prime minister, especially when an election is looming. When that Tory prime minister is Boris Johnson, it proved just too much. In response to his defeat, the prime minister rose to the dispatch box, fixed a smile to his face and spoke as if, to use a phrase made notorious by his predecessor, \u201cnothing has changed\u201d. Of course, quite a lot has changed. By the time you read this, the government will have sent a letter to the EU requesting an extension to the Brexit deadline, something Mr Johnson has repeatedly sworn he would never do, or he will be in breach of the law. His deal is not necessarily dead. He mustered 306 votes, 20 more than Mrs May ever got for her deal. This leaves him 14 short of what he needs for a majority. Some of the MPs who defied him over the Letwin amendment, including Sir Oliver himself, have said they will support the government when it comes to votes on the Brexit legislation. There\u2019s not much doubt, though, that the road ahead has become a great deal more rocky for Mr Johnson. Parliament will be able to seize the opportunity to subject his deal to the searching and detailed scrutiny that the government sought to evade yesterday. Pressure can be increased on ministers to reveal the true costs of the Johnson deal. Those hoping to take the question back to the people have more time to convince parliament to embrace a fresh referendum. Boris Johnson called this special Saturday sitting in the hope that it would give him a reputation-boosting, momentum-building victory to flourish. He wanted to be able to claim that Brexit was done and dusted. Instead, Brexit is not done and he is dusted. Much is in flux after another \u201chistoric\u201d parliamentary vote that failed to settle Britain\u2019s future. One thing is certain. Our long national nightmare continues. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",
