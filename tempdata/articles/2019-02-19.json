Ryan, the MP for Enfield North, said she had been a member for four decades but could no longer remain as a Labour MP. Echoing Luciana Berger, the Jewish MP for Liverpool Wavertree, Ryan blamed what she claimed was the Labour leadership\u2019s \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d in the face of the \u201cevil\u201d of antisemitism, for her decision to resign. In a stinging resignation letter, she said: \u201cI cannot remain a member of the Labour party while this requires me to suggest that I believe Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 a man who has presided over the culture of anti-Jewish racism and hatred of Israel that now afflicts my former party \u2013 is fit to be prime minister of this country.

Ryan also claimed there were \u201cmany very, very unhappy\u201d MPs in Labour who could come to a similar decision and join the Independent Group of MPs. The news of Ryan\u2019s resignation emerged as Westminster was abuzz with rumours that a string of centrist Tories could be poised to join the Independent Group, which was formed on Monday by seven former Labour MPs, including Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie. The ardent anti-Brexit campaigners Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston, as well as Heidi Allen, who has been on an anti-poverty tour around Britain with the ex-Labour MP Frank Field, were deemed the most likely recruits, but did not respond to requests for comment. Another vehement critic of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit policy, Sam Gyimah, the former Tory minister who resigned over the government\u2019s position on Brexit, ruled out joining the Independent Group. \u201cI hugely admire Luciana Berger\u2019s brave stance against antisemitism.

      "bodyText": "Liverpool Alisson Occasionally over-confident with ball at his feet, important early save to prevent Matip own goal. 6 Trent Alexander-Arnold Gave possession away on a few occasions, swapped wings with Robertson towards end of first half. 7 Jo\u00ebl Matip Solid but not the player Liverpool would have chosen to finish two of their best opportunities. 6 Fabinho Calm at centre-half, considering he had Lewandowski to look after. Broke forward and distributed well in early stages. 7 Andy Robertson Overhit a couple of crosses, usually found himself pressed back by Bayern\u2019s wide players. 6 Georginio Wijnaldum Like the rest of Liverpool\u2019s midfield, poise and promise tended to fizzle out higher up the pitch. 7 Jordan Henderson Some incisive passes from rear of midfield, one of which created early chance for Salah. 8 Naby Ke\u00efta Eager to take possession and used the ball intelligently, if not always imaginatively. Not decisive enough with second-half chance to free Robertson. 7 Mohamed Salah Wide with first-half header some great backheels, but ultimately not an unanswerable problem for the Bayern defence. 7 Roberto Firmino Masterful at creating space and danger from unpromising positions, few chances. Not his night. 7 Sadio Man\u00e9 Glaring first-half miss with his back to goal, though he did have the time to turn and take a proper look. 7 Subs James Milner (for Ke\u00efta 76) 5, Divock Origi (for Firmino 76) 5. Not used Daniel Sturridge, Alberto Moreno, Adam Lallana, Simon Mignolet, Xherdan Shaqiri Bayern Munich Manuel Neuer Even more of a spectator than Alisson for the most part, did what he needed to do with usual reliability. 6 Joshua Kimmich Booked for foul on Man\u00e9 in first half, so right-back will be suspended for the second leg. 6 Niklas S\u00fcle Looked susceptible to Liverpool\u2019s pressing at first, perhaps not tested enough by the home front three. 6 Mats Hummels A little cumbersome at times in bringing the ball out, but grew into game and an impressively impassable barrier by the end. 8 David Alaba Strong and purposeful when going forward, not unduly troubled by Salah most of the evening. 6 Javi Mart\u00ednez Midfield kingpin, authoritative and hard working in defence, powerful and committed when going forward. 9 Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara Neat and tidy in the middle, partnership with Mart\u00ednez meant Bayern held their own in midfield. 7 Serge Gnabry Control let him down in Liverpool\u2019s penalty area when Bayern could have taken a first-half lead. Decent shot in second half 7 James Rodr\u00edguez Not bad at taking corners, just a pity he was seldom noticed on the pitch for doing anything else. 6 Kingsley Coman Effective outlet on left, pace and control made for entertaining battle with Alexander-Arnold 7 Robert Lewandowski Surprisingly few touches, never mind chances, given his midfield saw as much of ball as Liverpool\u2019s 6 Subs Franck Rib\u00e9ry (for Coman 82) 5, Renato Sanches (for James 88) n/a, Rafinha (for Gnabry 90) n/a. Not used Alphonso Davies, Sven Ulreich, Lars Mai, Meritan Shabani",

There were about ten situations, either on the counter or around the box, when we gave it away or shot in their legs. So the positive thing is that the result is the best draw you can get. But yes, we can play better. It was a big fight, and we had the better chances. For us it is OK, the tie is not over. It\u2019s not a dream result, but a good one and we can work with it. It\u2019s not a game you will remember in 20 years! A lot of things were really good but we were playing against an outstandingly good side. I\u2019m not over the moon, but I\u2019m completely OK.

But we kept a clean sheet and defended well, which is a positive, and had enough chances in the first half to score one or two. But it\u2019s not the worst result in the world. We\u2019ve got to go there and put in a performance. I thought our level was good but we lacked a little in our final third. We had to defend with everyone and counter-pressed well, but they\u2019re a good team and are going to have moments. It\u2019s still alive. It\u2019ll be difficult but we have experience in the Champions League. We go again.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Andy Robertson adds: </strong>\u201cWe were playing a very experienced team. Obviously we went on a run last year, but they\u2019ve been there and done it for five or six years, and know how to break up the play, especially away from home. We need to go over there and believe we can cause them the problems we caused them tonight, and get a crucial goal. Fabinho is different class, he did a job and put in a couple of decent tackles. We were there to protect him but he didn\u2019t need it.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c6c7acae4b0793c8d0b23d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-19T21:59:23.143Z\">9.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>In retrospect, it was always going to end like this, wasn\u2019t it? </strong>Two free-scoring attacks against a couple of creaking defences. You know how football works. We should have known better. Bayern were superb at the back tonight, and look very happy with their evening\u2019s work, as they should. They go over to share a moment with their fans. Everybody happy. But they didn\u2019t show too much in attack. Liverpool weren\u2019t at their best, but Joel Matip\u2019s weird slice towards his own net apart, the VVD-less defence wasn\u2019t troubled much. Liverpool will console themselves with the knowledge that Bayern will attack more at home, presumably leaving their forward three a little more space in which to work. And to be fair, they still managed to create chances against Bayern\u2019s relentless defence tonight; they just forgot to work Manuel Neuer, is all. Bayern are favourites to progress now, of course, but Liverpool aren\u2019t in Ah Well Let\u2019s Concentrate On The League territory just yet.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c6c7a73e4b051cdac4f0349\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-19T21:52:55.739Z\">9.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FULL TIME: Liverpool 0-0 Bayern Munich</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And that\u2019s that.

But he can\u2019t get enough on it, and it\u2019s an easy claim for Neuer.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c6c6286e4b0793c8d0b231b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-19T20:11:09.995Z\">8.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Space for Gnabry down the right.

That was a semi-final clash in 1981, Liverpool winning on away goals thanks to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVu21GZrb6E#t=4m37s\">Ray Kennedy\u2019s late strike, a typically clinical, cute and clever finish from a quiet genius</a>.</p> <p><strong>That tie apart, the clubs have only played three other competitive Uefa matches. </strong>Bayern came out on top in the semi-finals of the 1972 Cup Winners Cup, Gerd M\u00fcller (2) and Uli Hoeness doing the damage in a 3-1 win in Munich, Alun Evans scoring Liverpool\u2019s consolation. Then in the 2001 Super Cup at Monaco\u2019s Stade Louis II, John Arne Riise, Emile Heskey and Michael Owen put Gerard Houllier\u2019s side three up, just enough to hold off a late Bayern comeback launched by Hasan Salihamid\u017ei\u0107 and Carsten Jancker.</p> <p><strong>So here\u2019s a weird historical quirk.</strong> Both of the matches played at Anfield - in those aforementioned 1972 and 1981 double-headers - ended goalless. That trend has to end tonight, surely, with neither team looking particularly solid at the back. Liverpool are missing the suspended Virgil van Dijk as well as the injured Joe Gomez and Dejan Lovren; they\u2019ll most likely be depending on the makeshift pairing of Joel Matip and Fabinho. Bayern meanwhile have become uncharacteristically leaky: they\u2019ve conceded eight goals in their last four matches. But what an attack: 20 goals in the last seven games, eight more than Liverpool have managed over a similar stretch.</p> <p><strong>Goals, then? </strong>Yes please! If you could! It\u2019s the 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984 and 2005 winners against the 1974, 1975, 1976, 2001 and 2013 champions. It\u2019s a battle for a place in the 2019 quarters! It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick-off: </strong>8pm.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-19T19:17:39.423Z\">at 7.17pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "More courage required, says Klopp: Meat and potatoes from Jordan Henderson: How did the players perform? Paul Wilson runs the rule over them: And that\u2019s your lot. Andy Hunter was our man at Anfield, and here\u2019s his take. Thanks for reading, and see you here in three weeks for the second leg. Nighty night! Here\u2019s a relaxed and smiling Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BT Sport. \u201cFirst half we forced it a little bit. It was not a day when it clicked in the very first minute. Bayern are obviously very strong. We made our life a bit difficult with the last pass. There were about ten situations, either on the counter or around the box, when we gave it away or shot in their legs. So the positive thing is that the result is the best draw you can get. But yes, we can play better. It was a big fight, and we had the better chances. For us it is OK, the tie is not over. It\u2019s not a dream result, but a good one and we can work with it. It\u2019s not a game you will remember in 20 years! A lot of things were really good but we were playing against an outstandingly good side. I\u2019m not over the moon, but I\u2019m completely OK. So let\u2019s recover and play against United which will be another tough one.\u201d Jordan Henderson speaks to BT Sport. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously disappointing that we haven\u2019t scored. But we kept a clean sheet and defended well, which is a positive, and had enough chances in the first half to score one or two. But it\u2019s not the worst result in the world. We\u2019ve got to go there and put in a performance. I thought our level was good but we lacked a little in our final third. We had to defend with everyone and counter-pressed well, but they\u2019re a good team and are going to have moments. It\u2019s still alive. It\u2019ll be difficult but we have experience in the Champions League. We go again.\u201d Andy Robertson adds: \u201cWe were playing a very experienced team. Obviously we went on a run last year, but they\u2019ve been there and done it for five or six years, and know how to break up the play, especially away from home. We need to go over there and believe we can cause them the problems we caused them tonight, and get a crucial goal. Fabinho is different class, he did a job and put in a couple of decent tackles. We were there to protect him but he didn\u2019t need it.\u201d In retrospect, it was always going to end like this, wasn\u2019t it? Two free-scoring attacks against a couple of creaking defences. You know how football works. We should have known better. Bayern were superb at the back tonight, and look very happy with their evening\u2019s work, as they should. They go over to share a moment with their fans. Everybody happy. But they didn\u2019t show too much in attack. Liverpool weren\u2019t at their best, but Joel Matip\u2019s weird slice towards his own net apart, the VVD-less defence wasn\u2019t troubled much. Liverpool will console themselves with the knowledge that Bayern will attack more at home, presumably leaving their forward three a little more space in which to work. And to be fair, they still managed to create chances against Bayern\u2019s relentless defence tonight; they just forgot to work Manuel Neuer, is all. Bayern are favourites to progress now, of course, but Liverpool aren\u2019t in Ah Well Let\u2019s Concentrate On The League territory just yet. And that\u2019s that. A 0-0 scoreline at home isn\u2019t the worst in Europe - no away goal conceded - but it\u2019s not ideal either. It\u2019s advantage Bayern at the halfway stage, and Jurgen Klopp doesn\u2019t look particularly happy. 90 min +4: Bayern continue to break up Liverpool\u2019s attempts to attack. Robertson eventually fouls Javi Martinez in frustration. 90 min +3: Mane has a good run at Sule down the left, but his attempted pass through to the nearby Salah is cut out by Javi Martinez. Bayern have bested Liverpool at their own pressing game tonight. 90 min +2: Bayern keep hold of the ball. Anfield considers this in silence. 90 min +1: Rafinha comes on for the excellent Serge Gnabry. 90 min: Sule goes over having had his toes squished by Origi. Time ticks on. Bayern have run the clock down in the professional style. There will be four added minutes. 89 min: The free kick isn\u2019t up to much, and sails through the box unchallenged. Throw for Bayern, and the pressure\u2019s off. 88 min: Hummels clumsily clatters into the back of Origi, who was going nowhere down the Liverpool right. A free kick and a chance for Alexander-Arnold to deliver something into the box. 87 min: James Rodriguez trots off. Renato Sanches, who lost at Anfield 5-0 last season with Swansea City, replaces him. Eventually the goal kick\u2019s taken. 86 min: The resulting corner sees Mane and the hapless Matip get in each other\u2019s road. The ball sails harmlessly over the bar for a goal kick. Martinez then goes down with cramp, and he milks it marvellously, a masterclass in gamesmanship and clock management. 85 min: Wijnaldum drives at a backtracking Bayern defence. He\u2019s got players either side, but confuses himself and clanks his pass into a green shirt. Liverpool come again through Robertson, and his low cross from the left is flicked towards the bottom left by Mane\u2019s deft stooping header. Neuer turns it round the post. 83 min: Milner slips Salah into space down the right. Salah wins a corner off Alaba. Alexander-Arnold takes. It\u2019s half-cleared. Henderson hoicks the ball into the mixer. It\u2019s half-cleared again. Henderson loops long towards Robertson, coming in from the left. The ball breaks to Matip, on the edge of the area. He\u2019s got time to take a touch, but slashes a first-time effort over the bar. That\u2019s abysmal. Liverpool\u2019s two best chances have fallen to Matip, which explains an awful lot. 81 min: The corner\u2019s half cleared. Alexander-Arnold attempts a wildly optimistic shot from 30 yards. It flies 30 yards over the bar. And then Bayern make their first change, swapping Kingsley Coman for Franck Ribery. Bayern sniff a precious away goal. 80 min: Henderson nicks the ball off Thiago, and sends Mane scampering into space. Mane rolls the ball wide left for the marauding Robertson, whose shot is deflected wide by Kimmich. Corner. 79 min: Space for James down the inside-left channel. He pulls a low shot across goal and harmlessly wide right. 78 min: It\u2019s pelting down at Anfield. James wedges a pass down the left to release Alaba, who then looks for Coman in the middle. Liverpool are in the process of scrambling clear when the flag goes up for offside from the original pass. Bayern look the most likely to break the deadlock. 76 min: Thiago sprays a diagonal ball to Gnabry on the right. He cuts inside and lashes wildly over from distance. Liverpool then make the first changes of the evening: James Milner and Divock Origi replace the confidence-light Naby Keita and the recovering Roberto Firmino. 74 min: Keita turns on the jets to dribble down the left. The ball\u2019s eventually flicked wide right to Salah, who sashays into the area. He makes some space to shoot, fighting his way past Alaba, but then a heavy touch takes him into territory occupied by his own man Wijnaldum, who can\u2019t get out the way. Chance spurned. 72 min: Alexander-Arnold\u2019s delivery is uncharacteristically poor, but Sule needlessly flicks a header behind for a corner. Liverpool look the gift horse in the mouth, doing absolutely nothing with the bonus set piece. 70 min: Salah dribbles in from the right, across the face of the box. He wants a free kick as Hummels slides in, but he\u2019s not getting it. Anfield boils over in frustration. But then there\u2019s a new burst of life in the crowd as James drags down Matip while attempting to break. A free kick that allows Liverpool to load the box. 68 min: Keita continues to look pained, as he\u2019s charged down twice in quick succession just inside the Bayern box, before he can pull the trigger to shoot. If ever there\u2019s a player who needs a goal to build some confidence and unlock his vast potential, it\u2019s Keita. 66 min: Good pressing by Firmino, Robertson and Keita down the left. Keita threatens to break clear in the box, but James nips in ahead of him, then slips over and is gifted a free kick. Keita looks pained. 65 min: A throw to Liverpool deep in Bayern territory. Alexander-Arnold doesn\u2019t have many options, and flings it straight to Neuer. Bayern are doing a number on Liverpool here. Do the hosts have an answer? 64 min: Matip shanks a simple pass out of play. The first groans this evening from the Anfield faithful, who are beginning to get antsy. On the touchline, Klopp prowls with a frown. 62 min: Thiago stands on Henderson\u2019s foot. Henderson isn\u2019t too pleased about it, but it looked accidental, all happening in a spilt second as the pair contested a loose ball. 61 min: Alexander-Arnold steals the ball off Coman and goes off on a baroque dribble down the right. He glides into the box, and for a second it all looks like it\u2019s going to open up. But Hummels closes him down just in time. But that\u2019s the sort of energy Liverpool need to show. Much better. 60 min: Alisson boots long. Salah is caught offside. Liverpool are beginning to get a little frustrated. A few heads hanging. Bayern look comfortable right now. 59 min: Gnabry has been Bayern\u2019s most exciting attacker tonight. He cuts in from the right and pearls a fine left-footed shot towards the top right. It\u2019s inches over the bar. Alisson would probably have met it, with a fingertip at least, had it been on target. But it would have been a close-run thing; it really was a magnificent effort. 58 min: The corner\u2019s hit long. James shoots, coming in from the left. It\u2019s deflected out for another corner on the other side. That one\u2019s a complete waste of time. 57 min: Gnabry dribbles with purpose down the right and into the box. He skates past Robertson and Keita, and is finally stopped by Fabinho, who blocks for a corner on the right. 55 min: Henderson is booked for clipping the heel of Javi Martinez, who is happy to stay on the ground awhile tugging at his bootlaces and socks. Anfield responds in frustration. 53 min: Keita bursts down the middle into an awful lot of space, Bayern having committed too many men forward. His pass wide left for Robertson should send the left-back clear, but he hits James. He gets a second chance, but the ball clanks off Robertson and loops towards the right-hand post. Salah is there, tight on the byline with Firmino in attendance, but he takes a wild fresh-air swipe and it\u2019s a goal kick. A wonderful chance spurned. 52 min: Coman races into acres down the left. He steams past Wijnaldum and crosses low to Lewandowski by the near post. Lewandowski traps and shapes to shoot, but Fabinho block-tackles brilliantly, a fine challenge given any mistake would have resulted in a penalty kick. 50 min: Kimmich goes down having been nicked by Mane. Then he springs up when, play having continued, the ball comes back to him. Plenty of pantomime whistling. All good clean fun. 48 min: A free kick from Alexander-Arnold out on the right. He floats it into the mixer, and the ball gently scrapes the top of Hummels\u2019 head. It should be a corner on the left, but Liverpool don\u2019t get the decision. Goal kick. Nobody in red seems particularly upset, to be fair. 47 min: Liverpool put the press on, and Bayern give up possession in the final third. Wijnaldum loops a fine pass wide right for Alexander-Arnold, who controls it at pace, enters the box, and slips inside for Salah. But Liverpool\u2019s star striker can\u2019t sort his feet out for a shot. A nice sweeping move though. Bayern get the second half underway! Liverpool kick towards the Kop in this second half, as is their preference. There have been no half-time changes. Half-time entertainment: This classic Joy of Six features the story of the 1981 semi-final between these two giants of the European Cup. The peerless Rob Smyth is your host. One minute of added time. Salah\u2019s persistence down the right allows Alexander-Arnold to cross. Firmino flicks on at the near post, but can\u2019t find Mane and Neuer gathers. And that\u2019s the end of an entertaining first half. Not sure how it\u2019s still goalless; Joel Matip could easily have scored at both ends for starters. It promises to be quite the second half; don\u2019t leave us now! 45 min: Liverpool are beginning to create chances. Some nice one-touch interplay down the inside-right channel from Salah and Wijnaldum, and suddenly Firmino has the ball beside the byline. He dinks into the middle for Mane, but there\u2019s too much weight on the pass, and Bayern are able to clear. 43 min: Firmino heads the set piece clear of danger. But Bayern are soon coming back down the right again through the excellent Gnabry. Liverpool are thankful that Henderson\u2019s radar is working, and he nips in to intercept just when his team were looking stretched. 42 min: Better from Matip down the other end, as he intercepts a Gnabry right-wing cross with Lewandowski waiting to slam home from six yards. It\u2019s a corner, though. 40 min: It\u2019s end-to-end fun now! Coman wins a corner down the left; Lewandowski runs into his own man Martinez and Alisson is able to clear. Up the other end, Wijnaldum dinks a ball, right to left, to find Mane clear, but facing a tight angle. He wins a corner from which Firmino sets Salah away down the left with a cute backheel. Salah\u2019s low cross to the near post is slapped wide, first time, by Matip, who beats the ground in frustration over his miss. 38 min: Keita, to the right of the D, shoots. The ball loops up off Hummels and drops to Mane, who once again has his back to goal. This time he tries a super-spectacular bicycle kick towards the top right. He shins it well wide right. 36 min: Alaba and Coman combine well down the left to win a corner. James takes his own sweet time to wander over and take it. It\u2019s not worth the wait, Fabinho heading purposefully clear. But then Alexander-Arnold is dispossessed when attempting to counter, and Gnabry is able to whistle a low shot from the inside-right position towards the bottom left. Alisson can\u2019t be sure that it\u2019s going wide - though it is - and fingertips round the post well. The resulting corner leads to nothing. 34 min: A short break in play as Kimmich gets sponged down by the trainer. He\u2019ll be good to continue. 32 min: Firmino dribbles down the middle and flicks towards Keita, who has space on the edge of the box. Keita shoots low towards the bottom left, but the ball\u2019s blocked by a fine spread from Sule. The ball breaks to Mane on the penalty spot. Mane\u2019s facing the wrong way, so swivels through 180 degrees and sends a confused effort wide right. Liverpool claim a penalty, the ball having hit Sule\u2019s hand after the block, but it was totally accidental and they\u2019re never getting that decision, VAR or no. 31 min: Space for Robertson down the left, with team-mates in the Bayern box. But he blasts a dreadful cross over the area and out of play on the right. Quite a few men in red are looking shaky tonight. 30 min: On the touchline, Bayern coach Niko Kovac rants in a very expressive style. Not exactly sure why, because nothing of note\u2019s happened on the field of play. But it\u2019s enough for the referee to come across and order him to pipe down, else he\u2019ll be sitting in Anfield\u2019s fancy new main stand. 29 min: Liverpool are at their best when they pile forward quickly. Henderson fires a pass up the centre to get Wijnaldum, Mane and Keita running at the visitors. Nothing quite comes off this time, but Bayern look nervous when forced to backtrack. 27 min: Mane dribbles hard down the left, and is cynically hacked from behind by Kimmich. That means the Bayern right-back misses the second leg. 26 min: Bayern knock the ball around at the back to take a little of the sting out of the game. Their fans are still making the majority of the noise. \u201cAlisson has so far given us his best Dudek and Karius,\u201d suggests Niall Mullen. \u201cIf he could stay away from James, Westerveld, Carson, Kirkland, Jones, Friedel, Mignolet and Arphexhad, then we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d 24 min: Sule clumsily, and needlessly, bundles over Mane near the left-hand corner flag. A free kick, to be taken by Alexander-Arnold. The free kick, flicked to the near post, is cleared back to Alexander-Arnold, who loops a glorious ball to the far post for Salah, racing in from the right. It\u2019s a chance on a plate, but Salah sends his downward header wide right from close range. Not entirely sure how this game is still goalless. 22 min: Gnabry latches onto a very poor backwards header from Robertson, intended for Matip. Gnabry takes a heavy touch to run the ball out for a goal kick, which is another let-off for Liverpool, because Lewandowski was all alone in the middle, Matip having been attracted to Gnabry like a moth to a flame. 20 min: Keita tries to get Liverpool going in attack once more, driving passes forward, breaking the lines. He ends up on the edge of the Bayern box, taking turns with Salah to miskick with their backs to goal. Eventually Keita flicks the ball up and attempts an ambitious overhead kick, which harmlessly bounces out wide right for a goal kick. But full marks for ambition. 18 min: Not sure how Liverpool\u2019s goal is still intact. Alisson\u2019s footwork hasn\u2019t been too good; Matip looks a bag of nerves. Anfield is reacting accordingly, with the Bayern fans making all the noise now. 16 min: Salah, out on the right, slips a ball inside for Keita, who shuttles it on to Mane. Mane dribbles hard into the area, but slams his shot wide left. Bayern go straight up the other end and once again nearly score, Lewandowski closing down Alisson, who flicks lamely to Matip. Matip then attempts a similarly weak flick away, and is dispossessed by Coman, who lashes a shot into the side netting from a tight position on the left. 14 min: Gnabry tears down the right. His low fizzing cross is met by Lewand... hold on, no, it\u2019s Matip, who slices hard towards his own goal from close range. Alisson is in exactly the right place, and the ball smashes off him. Not sure he knew anything about that. A huge stroke of luck for Liverpool. A hectic game of pinball in the area ensues. Liverpool eventually clear their lines. 12 min: Thiago clips the heel of Wijnaldum as he dribbles down the right. Free kick, to be taken by Alexander-Arnlold. Hummels heads clear. But Liverpool come again, and Henderson, just to the left of the centre circle, floats a ball down the middle and finds Salah racing into the area! He\u2019s ahead of Sule, and sticks out a telescopic boot in the hope of guiding the ball into the bottom left. But he can\u2019t get enough on it, and it\u2019s an easy claim for Neuer. 10 min: Space for Gnabry down the right. He dinks a cross into the box. Alisson comes out to punch, but Fabinho gets in the road and heads upfield instead. No harm done, but Fabinho holds a hand up in apology to his keeper. Some early miscommunication there; Liverpool may end up missing Virgil van Dijk terribly. 8 min: Bayern begin to hog the ball. They\u2019re not doing much with it, but that\u2019s not really the point. They\u2019ve quietened Anfield considerably, their first task successfully completed. 6 min: Coman dribbles down the left and nearly breaks into the Liverpool box. The ball flies away from him, and Henderson should clear, but the Liverpool midfielder blooters the ball into Coman\u2019s face. For a second, the rebound seems to have teed up Lewandowski, but the flag goes up for hand-ball against Coman, which seems a little generous to the hosts. 5 min: Sule and Hummels knock the ball around at the back in style. Memories of Hansen and Lawrenson, though the crowd give this particular tribute act pelters. Neuer then shanks a pass into touch, but the indiscretion doesn\u2019t cause Bayern any serious bother. 3 min: Liverpool press hard but Neuer is calm under pressure with the ball at his feet. Play moves up the other end, and it\u2019s the turn of Alisson to showcase his skills, finding Wijnaldum in the middle of the park with a threaded pass. Both teams look well up for piling forward. 2 min: Liverpool spend the first 60 seconds stroking the ball about. In the 61st, Lewandowski intercepts and is bowled over by Matip. Nothing comes of the free kick, in the centre circle, but Matip will need to be a lot calmer than that if he\u2019s to survive this evening without mishap. And we\u2019re off! Liverpool get the party started; Bayern will be kicking towards the Kop in this first half. A huge roar. \u201cGiven it\u2019s completely the wrong colour, would you go so far as to say the Liverpool one is not a germane pennant?\u201d Richard McGee, ladies and gentlemen, because somebody had to go there at some point. The teams are out! It\u2019s a typical Anfield European Night\u2122, with both sets of fans contributing to a wonderful pre-match atmosphere. A chorus of You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone drowns out the official Champions League anthem. Liverpool are in their famous red kit, so Bayern are forced into their second-choice light green. A reminder that VAR is in operation tonight, constantly checking for clear and obvious errors related to the following four match-changing situations: goals, incidents in the penalty area, red cards, and mistaken identity. We\u2019ll be off once coins have been tossed and pennants exchanged! A cheery Jurgen Klopp speaks to BT Sport ahead of this clash with his 2013 nemesis. \u201cIt was not a mind game, but Dejan had no chance for the game today, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s even got a chance for the next game. So it was clear Fabinho had to play tonight. Bobby was positive yesterday but he was not fine; today he is fine. The further you go, the stronger your opponents get, though we have already faced some strong opponents. Tonight we will face a proper opponent. They have problems as well, so that\u2019s how it is, we always have to make the best of what we\u2019ve got. It will be a tough game for both teams!\u201d \u201c10th March 1971, Fairs Cup 4th round 1st leg, Liverpool 3 Bayern Munich 0 (Alun Evans Hat Trick),\u201d writes TG. A reference there to a tie omitted in the preamble of this MBM. Yes, Liverpool and Bayern have only met five times in Uefa competition ... but I didn\u2019t mention their quarter-final match-up in the old Fairs Cup in 1971, a tournament outside Uefa control at the time. So let\u2019s right that wrong. TG\u2019s covered the first leg; the second was drawn 1-1, Ian Ross and Edgar Schneider with the goals. Liverpool went on to lose to eventual winners Leeds in the semis. Winger John McLaughlin played in both quarter-final ties for the Reds, a fact I raise merely as an excuse to crowbar in this burst of melodic pugilism from his guitarist namesake. Pennant watch. Liverpool will be gifting Bayern this well-upholstered number. Hopefully captain Jordan Henderson won\u2019t hold it too closely to his chest before handing it over, else folk spot it doesn\u2019t quite match the red of the shirt. Let\u2019s hope Manuel Neuer also keeps his commemorative trinket well away from his clobber. Both pennant and shirt look lovely on their own terms, but they\u2019re very much in business for themselves. A quick exchange before kick-off to avoid all this clashing, and everybody\u2019s happy. As expected, Dejan Lovren wasn\u2019t able to make it back from injury, and so he sits it out with the suspended Virgil van Dijk in the stands. Liverpool name Joel Matip and Fabinho in the heart of their defence, while welcoming back Trent Alexander-Arnold and captain Jordan Henderson. Roberto Firmino had been suffering from a virus, but he\u2019s better now and able to start. As for Bayern: they make just one change to the team that fell behind twice at Augsburg last Friday, only to recover for a 3-2 win that closed the gap on Borussia Dortmund at the top of the Bundesliga. Javi Martinez returns, taking the place of the injured Leon Goretzka. Liverpool: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Matip, Fabinho, Robertson, Wijnaldum, Henderson, Keita, Mane, Salah, Firmino. Subs: Mignolet, Milner, Sturridge, Moreno, Lallana, Shaqiri, Origi. Bayern Munich: Neuer, Kimmich, Sule, Hummels, Alaba, Thiago, Martinez, James Rodriguez, Gnabry, Lewandowski, Coman. Subs: Ulreich, Ribery, Rafinha, Davies, Mai, Sanches, Shabani. Referee: Gianluca Rocchi (Italy). Liverpool and Bayern Munich have ten European Cups between them. So it\u2019s a little surprising, given their rich histories on the continent, that they\u2019ve only met each other in Europe\u2019s premier club competition once before. That was a semi-final clash in 1981, Liverpool winning on away goals thanks to Ray Kennedy\u2019s late strike, a typically clinical, cute and clever finish from a quiet genius. That tie apart, the clubs have only played three other competitive Uefa matches. Bayern came out on top in the semi-finals of the 1972 Cup Winners Cup, Gerd M\u00fcller (2) and Uli Hoeness doing the damage in a 3-1 win in Munich, Alun Evans scoring Liverpool\u2019s consolation. Then in the 2001 Super Cup at Monaco\u2019s Stade Louis II, John Arne Riise, Emile Heskey and Michael Owen put Gerard Houllier\u2019s side three up, just enough to hold off a late Bayern comeback launched by Hasan Salihamid\u017ei\u0107 and Carsten Jancker. So here\u2019s a weird historical quirk. Both of the matches played at Anfield - in those aforementioned 1972 and 1981 double-headers - ended goalless. That trend has to end tonight, surely, with neither team looking particularly solid at the back. Liverpool are missing the suspended Virgil van Dijk as well as the injured Joe Gomez and Dejan Lovren; they\u2019ll most likely be depending on the makeshift pairing of Joel Matip and Fabinho. Bayern meanwhile have become uncharacteristically leaky: they\u2019ve conceded eight goals in their last four matches. But what an attack: 20 goals in the last seven games, eight more than Liverpool have managed over a similar stretch. Goals, then? Yes please! If you could! It\u2019s the 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984 and 2005 winners against the 1974, 1975, 1976, 2001 and 2013 champions. It\u2019s a battle for a place in the 2019 quarters! It\u2019s on! Kick-off: 8pm.",

If we can in any way match Gareth Bale\u2019s performance on Saturday, it does not matter if the roof is open or closed, there will only be one result.\u201d Gravell was renowned for his fervent patriotism and outpourings of emotion. \u201cIt reminded you of the reasons some of us play rugby and why some of us who do not play any more miss it so much,\u201d said McBryde. \u201cWe do not want to burn ourselves out mentally, but it was a great way to kick off the week because it focused minds. Now we put it to bed and draw on the experience on Saturday.\u201d The Wales wing George North was among the players who watched the performance. \u201cIt was powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cIt showed the pride Grav had in Wales, one we all have. Rugby can be methodical, but there is still room for passion in the game.\u201d Wales know they will need to use their heads as well as their hearts if they are to defeat England and remain on course for their fourth Six Nations title since Warren Gatland took over as head coach at the end of 2007. \u201cIt is a big game,\u201d said McBryde. \u201cEngland are riding high on the back of two very good performances while we have had the results but perhaps not the performances. We have got a bit of work ahead of us. They have started matches strongly so we have to be able to weather the storm. We are going to have to be at our best.\u201d Wales are seeking a record 12th consecutive victory, prompting the England head coach Eddie Jones to remark that they were the best Wales team ever. \u201cI am not getting into mind games,\u201d said McBryde. \u201cEngland will be confident and we have to match that. It is a formidable task.\u201d Two years ago, Jones suckered Wales into thinking he was happy for the roof to be closed only to demand that it remained open just before the deadline for a decision. There will be no repeat, with McBryde saying that with a dry forecast this week, Wales were not bothered about shutting it and believed the atmosphere would be highly charged whatever. McBryde said that the fly-half Dan Biggar, who suffered a knee injury playing for Northampton on Saturday, was on course to be fit for selection while the full-back Leigh Halfpenny is taking a full part in training having recovered from concussion, although it is three months since he last played.",

They extended their unbeaten run at home in Europe to 20 ties and maintained a record of never having lost to German opposition at Anfield. A goalless first-leg draw will also stir memories of the 1981 semi-final when Liverpool advanced on away goals in the second leg in Munich. But, on a cold and relatively flat February night the result felt like meagre consolation against a supposedly vulnerable Bayern team undergoing transition with Kovac.</p> \n<p>Anfield frustration stemmed not only from their opponents\u2019 resilient and organised defending. It was self-inflicted too. Sadio Man\u00e9 squandered a gilt-edged chance to change the complexion of the last 16 tie and Klopp lamented the succession of poor final balls that offered Bayern respite. Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino were kept subdued, understandably so in the latter\u2019s case given he had suffered a virus 24 hours before kick-off.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"655493a854364a1dd10c93ed42fb019fde00603b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/655493a854364a1dd10c93ed42fb019fde00603b/0_193_4477_2688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bayern Munich fans\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bayern Munich fans display banners protesting at Liverpool ticket prices, a move supported by the home supporters.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rich Linley - CameraSport/CameraSport via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Bayern, their fans and Liverpool will expect, must show more willingness to attack on home soil in three weeks\u2019 time.

Perhaps that explained the lack of intensity and certainty in Liverpool\u2019s performance with a key domestic date awaiting at Manchester United on Sunday. Or perhaps, more likely, the team that has reigned supreme in Germany since 2012 was not the creaking, vulnerable unit advertised.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Bayern were patient, intelligent but conservative in possession, a consequence of both Liverpool\u2019s pressing and their own contentment with a goalless stalemate. The visitors were encouraged forward more by Liverpool\u2019s defence giving up chances far too cheaply than their enthusiasm to support Robert Lewandowski.</p> \n<p>A dip in the defensive strength and organisation that has characterised Liverpool\u2019s title challenge might have been expected with Van Dijk serving a one-match suspension but his replacement, Fabinho, impressed greatly. The problem was Alisson\u2019s carelessness in possession. He had already escaped with one loose pass to Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara when dawdling too long on a Joel Matip back pass. Lewandowski hassled the Brazil international into an error that ended with Kingsley Coman shooting into the side-netting. In fairness to the Liverpool keeper he made a vital block from Matip when the central defender sliced a Serge Gnabry cross towards his own net.</p> \n<p>Liverpool closed the first half on top but their increasing threat proved deceptive in a tepid second half. Salah volleyed their first opportunity at Manuel Neuer when picked out by a superb ball over the top from Jordan Henderson, who impressed against Bayern\u2019s midfield three. The Egypt international also headed a clearer opening wide when Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s inviting lob found him unmarked at the back post.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Liverpool\u2019s best chance landed at the feet of Man\u00e9 after Firmino had released Naby Ke\u00efta with a deft touch. Ke\u00efta\u2019s shot deflected off Niklas S\u00fcle to Man\u00e9 who, unmarked but with his back to goal, dragged a shot well wide on the turn. Man\u00e9 sought to make amends with a theatrical overhead kick from another deflected Ke\u00efta effort but with the same result. A trip on the Senegal international by Joshua Kimmich yielded the night\u2019s first booking and suspended the influential full back from the second leg. His absence may be felt at the Allianz Arena.</p> \n<p>Fabinho minimised the impact of Van Dijk\u2019s absence on Liverpool with a composed display in the heart of defence. Together, the Brazilian midfielder and Matip kept Lewandowski quiet, with Bayern\u2019s brightest moments provided by Coman and Gnabry down the flanks. The Poland striker\u2019s first sense of goal arrived from a Coman cross early in the second half but Fabinho intervened with a well-timed tackle. He produced another to prevent the France international leading a dangerous counterattack late on.</p> \n<p>The Bayern performance was increasingly safety-conscious the longer the stalemate remained, though inviting Liverpool forward in numbers was not without its risks. S\u00fcle was fortunate to see his clearance strike Andy Robertson and sail over Neuer but also wide of goal when he intercepted one Liverpool counter. Gnabry was required for a vital defensive touch just as Man\u00e9 sized up another sight of Neuer\u2019s goal as Liverpool searched for a breakthrough that, as a resigned Anfield appeared to sense, never seemed likely. \u201cWe had what we wanted from this game,\u201d Kovac tellingly admitted.</p>",

Klopp was involved in a heated exchange with his opposite number on the final whistle but, as he conceded afterwards: \u201cDay by day the result will feel better for us.\u201d Liverpool kept a clean sheet without Virgil van Dijk and with the goalkeeper Alisson offering Bayern greater opportunities than they engineered themselves. They extended their unbeaten run at home in Europe to 20 ties and maintained a record of never having lost to German opposition at Anfield. A goalless first-leg draw will also stir memories of the 1981 semi-final when Liverpool advanced on away goals in the second leg in Munich. But, on a cold and relatively flat February night the result felt like meagre consolation against a supposedly vulnerable Bayern team undergoing transition with Kovac. Anfield frustration stemmed not only from their opponents\u2019 resilient and organised defending. It was self-inflicted too. Sadio Man\u00e9 squandered a gilt-edged chance to change the complexion of the last 16 tie and Klopp lamented the succession of poor final balls that offered Bayern respite. Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino were kept subdued, understandably so in the latter\u2019s case given he had suffered a virus 24 hours before kick-off. Bayern, their fans and Liverpool will expect, must show more willingness to attack on home soil in three weeks\u2019 time. Klopp\u2019s team will have to improve on three poor away performances so far in this season\u2019s competition to progress. \u201cNot perfect,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cBut good enough.\u201d The Champions League has provided an inspirational release for Liverpool during barren times in the Premier League but the dynamic has altered with Klopp\u2019s team in pursuit of the club\u2019s first championship since 1990. Perhaps that explained the lack of intensity and certainty in Liverpool\u2019s performance with a key domestic date awaiting at Manchester United on Sunday. Or perhaps, more likely, the team that has reigned supreme in Germany since 2012 was not the creaking, vulnerable unit advertised. Bayern were patient, intelligent but conservative in possession, a consequence of both Liverpool\u2019s pressing and their own contentment with a goalless stalemate. The visitors were encouraged forward more by Liverpool\u2019s defence giving up chances far too cheaply than their enthusiasm to support Robert Lewandowski. A dip in the defensive strength and organisation that has characterised Liverpool\u2019s title challenge might have been expected with Van Dijk serving a one-match suspension but his replacement, Fabinho, impressed greatly. The problem was Alisson\u2019s carelessness in possession. He had already escaped with one loose pass to Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara when dawdling too long on a Joel Matip back pass. Lewandowski hassled the Brazil international into an error that ended with Kingsley Coman shooting into the side-netting. In fairness to the Liverpool keeper he made a vital block from Matip when the central defender sliced a Serge Gnabry cross towards his own net. Liverpool closed the first half on top but their increasing threat proved deceptive in a tepid second half. Salah volleyed their first opportunity at Manuel Neuer when picked out by a superb ball over the top from Jordan Henderson, who impressed against Bayern\u2019s midfield three. The Egypt international also headed a clearer opening wide when Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s inviting lob found him unmarked at the back post. Liverpool\u2019s best chance landed at the feet of Man\u00e9 after Firmino had released Naby Ke\u00efta with a deft touch. Ke\u00efta\u2019s shot deflected off Niklas S\u00fcle to Man\u00e9 who, unmarked but with his back to goal, dragged a shot well wide on the turn. Man\u00e9 sought to make amends with a theatrical overhead kick from another deflected Ke\u00efta effort but with the same result. A trip on the Senegal international by Joshua Kimmich yielded the night\u2019s first booking and suspended the influential full back from the second leg. His absence may be felt at the Allianz Arena. Fabinho minimised the impact of Van Dijk\u2019s absence on Liverpool with a composed display in the heart of defence. Together, the Brazilian midfielder and Matip kept Lewandowski quiet, with Bayern\u2019s brightest moments provided by Coman and Gnabry down the flanks. The Poland striker\u2019s first sense of goal arrived from a Coman cross early in the second half but Fabinho intervened with a well-timed tackle. He produced another to prevent the France international leading a dangerous counterattack late on. The Bayern performance was increasingly safety-conscious the longer the stalemate remained, though inviting Liverpool forward in numbers was not without its risks. S\u00fcle was fortunate to see his clearance strike Andy Robertson and sail over Neuer but also wide of goal when he intercepted one Liverpool counter. Gnabry was required for a vital defensive touch just as Man\u00e9 sized up another sight of Neuer\u2019s goal as Liverpool searched for a breakthrough that, as a resigned Anfield appeared to sense, never seemed likely. \u201cWe had what we wanted from this game,\u201d Kovac tellingly admitted.",

Barcelona, you will remember, swept to the top of a group that included Spurs, Inter and PSV, while Lyon finished second below Manchester City despite winning away to Pep Guardiola\u2019s side. Oddly, all of Lyon\u2019s home matches in the group stage ended 2-2: Barcelona would probably take that today, since it would leave them as heavy favourites to finish the job at the Camp Nou. On the other hand, there is a clear opportunity for them to take an even bigger advantage from this first leg because suspension deprives Lyon of their snazzy playmaker, Nabil F\u00e9kir. <br></p> <p>But Lyon do still have some fine players as well as a habit of producing their best against the most formidable opponents. And this Bar\u00e7a side are vulnerable. Indeed, Bar\u00e7a have not won any of their last five away knockout matches in this competition and in their last one \u2013 against Roma last season \u2013 they were blown away. So there should be opportunities for both teams today and we can expect them to go at each other with gusto. We can look forward, in particular, to the duel between Lionel Messi and Ferland Mendy, the 23-year-old left-back whom Bar\u00e7a are known to admire. All in all, we\u2019ve got ourselves a potential humdinger. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-19T18:44:05.988Z\">at 6.44pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Match report here. The home crowd greet the final whistle with measured applause. Their team put in a tremendous effort and will fancy their chances of scoring an away leg, especially with Nabil F\u00e9kir back. Bar\u00e7a will be confident of netting in the Camp Nou too, of course, but they will have to finish better than they did here. Their precision continually abandoned them at the crucial moment and, in the end, they were thankful for a fabulous save by Ter Stegen, who pushed a shot by Terrier on to the crossbar in the first half. The second leg will be well worth following - and you\u2019ll be able to do that right here. See ya! 90+2: Barceloan try to walk it in but Lyon aren\u2019t about to allow that. In days gone by, Coutinho would settle this by lashing into the net from long range but he hasn\u2019t even tried that so far ... 90 min: Lyon will have to hang on for at least three more minutes ... 90 min: Messi dabs a feeble freekick into the wall and then rams the follow-up into it, too. The home fans jubilate! 89 min: A ridiculous, trademark run by Messi, slaloming between three defenders before being tripped at the edge of the area. Freekick in an ominous position, just outside the D ... 88 min: Semedo booked for pulling back Aouar after a fine run by the midfielder. 86 min: Messi thrashes another shot wide from a promising position. Bar\u00e7a just haven\u2019t had their shooting boots on today. 85 min: Messi runs to retrieve an overhit cross from the left, then picks out Busquets at the edge of the box. Busquets tries curl one into the net, but Lopes watch it all the way and tips it over the bar. He probably could have caught it but decided not to take the risk. 84 min: Suarez floats a cross from the right towards Coutinho. Dubois strains his neck to head clear. Lyon substitution: Cheikh Diop on, Ndombele off. 82 min: The effect of the away goal rule is interesting here: Barcelona are more eager to score as they know doing so now would swing the tie hugely in their favour; whereas the home team know that 0-0 would leave it tilted slightly their way, as an away goal in the Camp Nou would count double. 80 min: Roberto booked for kicking the ball away. And on that note, he\u2019s subbed off and replaced by Vidal. 77 min: Mendy is robbed on half way and suddenly Barcelona launch a dangerous attack, Suarez pinging a diagonal pass to Messi. Dubois does superbly to stop him from getting off a clear shot from 10 yards. 76 min: Coutinho lets fly from 20 yards. Lopes springs to his left and saves well. Lyon substitution: Here comes Cornet, in place of Terrier. 74 min: Alba, an increasing menace to Lyon, raids down the left and nips a cute ball into Suarez, who lunges at it and tries to poke it into the net from close range. But he didn\u2019t get a firm enough touch and Lopes is able to save. 73 min: Depay jinks past Semedo but then overhits his cross. 72 min: Barcelona starting to gain the upper hand. They\u2019re stretching Lyon more and more at the back but still can\u2019t find a sure touch when it really matters. 70 min: Ala picks out Suarez with a low cross from the left. The striker falls as he shoots first time ... and slashes the ball just wide from 18 yards! Lyon substitution: Tousart on, Traore off. No Cornet yet, then. Bruno Genesio probably thinking 0-0 isn\u2019t a bad result in the home leg. 68 min: Messi skitters through the Lyon defence, helped by a favourable ricochet. Then he tries to clip the ball over the advancing keeper. But the angle is too tight and the ball floats over the bar. Barcelona substitution: Coutinho on, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 off. 66 min: Messi swaps passes with Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and then unloads a shot from a difficult angle on the left. Lopes bats it away. 65 min: A break in play as Roberto\u2019s receives treatment for a bloodied nose caused, accidentally, by Aouar\u2019s elbow. 62 min: Lyon spring forward on the counter. Depay plays in Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, who beats Lenglet ... but Ter Stegen rusehs off his line to smother. 61 min: Depay whizzes down the left and flashes a cross into the danger zone. Ter Stegen cuts it out, spilling it the first time and then pouncing to retrieve. 60 min: Suarez goes down holding his head ... because the ball hit it. The ref is duped into awarding a freekick. 58 min: Semedo catches Mendy on the ankle, giving Lyon a freekick wide on the left. The crowd are peeved that none of these fouls by Barcelona are leading to yellow cards. And their anger deepens when Depay bogs the freekick way over the bar. 56 min: Alba finds Suarez in the box. But the Uruguayan\u2019s touch is off, and Denaye is quickly on him and relieves him of the ball. 54 min: Leglet, who has been unusually gauche today, whacks Depay from behind near halfway and somehow escapes a yellow card. 52 min: Alba challenges Traore on the left hand side of the Barcelona box. The ball squirts out to Depay, who aims a first-time curling shot towards the far post. It floats inches wide! 51 min: Smart positioning enables Marcelo to cut out a dangerous low cross from the left by Dembele. 49 min: Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 presents the ball to Messi, running on to it outside the D. but Messi\u2019s first touch is unusually oafish, allowing Denayer to step in and clear. 47 min: Bar\u00e7a make the brighter start to the second period, pushing Lyon back and probing ... until Lenglet gives the ball away. \u201cIsn\u2019t Suarez just a yard or so too slow these days,\u201d ventures Paul Fitzgerald. \u201cIncredibly instinctive player but but seems to labour onto through balls I\u2019ve noticed.\u201d That\u2019s been the case so far today, at any rate. 46 min: No substitutions during the break. \u201cFear not, Paul, Traor\be will make way for Cornet in 25 minutes,\u201d prophesizes Ane Onyme. And then what? Another Cornet winner? An entertaining and high-class half despite the lack of goals. There was no shortage of attacking and plenty of foxy moves but the finishing has mostly been off. Lyon came closest to scoring but Terrier was denied by a wonderful save from Ter Stegen. But Barcelona generally looked more dangerous although both teams had periods of superiority. It\u2019s hard to see this ending scoreless. 45+1 min: Busquets\u2019 shot from the edge of the area takes a nick off Denayer ... and glides a yard wide. 45 min: Beautiful move by Lyon! A series of one-twos open up the Bar\u00e7a ... can Terrier provide the perfect finish? No! he cracks his shot wide from 15 yards. 43 min: Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 collects a rolled pass from Messi near the edge of the Lyon box and then takes the keeper by surprise with a well disguised snapshot, Fortunately for Lyon it flashes just wide of the near post. 41 min: A rare mistake by Ndombele, who sends a pass straight to Sergi Roberto, who, in turn, release Suarez down the right. Suddenly Bar\u00e7a have 3 v 3. But Suarez\u2019s pass towards Dembele is too long. 40 min: Lenglet gets lucky as the ref rules that he\u2019s fouled by Depay, who rolled past him and sent Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 clear for what would have been a great chance. 38 min: Messi delivers a sumptuous cross from the left, but Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 gets his attempted volley all wrong. 35 min: Suarez tries to chip the keeper from just outside the area. But Lopez was practically on his line and not likely to fall for that. 34 min: Busquets flicks on Messi\u2019s freekick at the near post. Lenglet tries to head in but, under pressure from Denayer, manages only to nod over the bar. 33 min: Suarez performs a one-two in the box with Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 but then is forced back out of the area by Dubois ... who then shoves him and gets a booking. Freekick to Bar\u00e7a wide on the left. 30 min: Lovely play by the hosts. Ndombele again heavily involved before Depay slips a nice pass through to Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, who open fire from the edge of the box. but Piqu\u00e9 slides in to make a critical block. 28 min: Lyon\u2019s good spell continues. They\u2019re penning Bar\u00e7a back with some very adroit passing ... until Depay overhits and attempted throughball to Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. 27 min: Depay\u2019s freekick is headed clear by Piqu\u00e9. 26 min: A good move by Lyon - orchestrated by Ndombele - relieves the pressure, allowing the hosts to spend a bit of time in the opposing half. Mendy joins in the attack and races past Sergi Roberto before the being chopped down. Freekick to Lyon wide on the left. 24 min: Messi fizzes in a corner. Mendy heads it away at the near post. 23 min: Bar\u00e7a are setting up camp in the Lyon half. 21 min: Bar\u00e7a tear forward again. They\u2019re ripping into Lyon every time they get the ball now and it\u2019s starting to look ominous for the French side. But they\u2019ve been spared so far by Bar\u00e7a\u2019s uncharacteristically shoddy finishing. Dembele has jsut given another example, ballooning the ball into the stands when Suarez was appealing for a pass in front of goal. 19 min: O Dembele turns Dubois inside out down the left. Lopes prevents him from topping off the run with a goal, making a good one-on-one save from the left. 17 min: After a lovely buildup, Alba pulls a pass back from the left for Messi, who has a clear shot from 14 yards. But he lifts his shot way over the bar. A lapse in basic technique by the Messi, who can\u2019t quite believe it! 15 min: Sergi Roberto tees up Rakitic at the edge of the box. The Croat aims a gentle curler towards the far corner ... but it drifts fractionally wide. 14 min: After a nice passing sequence by Lyon, Depay over-indulges and gets dispossessed near half-way by Messi, who immediately skedaddles forward to try to inflict maximum punishment. Lyon\u2019s defence scrambles sufficiently to block his shot from 20 yards. 12 min: M. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 fouls O. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. Messi curls in the freekick from the left. Marcelo\u2019s header doesn\u2019t quite clear. O. Dembele picks it up on the edge of the box but skies the shot. 9 min: Terrier comes in from the left and collects a lay-back by Dembele before unleashing an absolutely ferocious shot from 25 yards! And Ter Stegen makes a wonderful one-handed save! Reaching it was a feat, but having the hand-strength to push the shot on t o the crossbar was even more impressive. And then he got up and snaffled the rebound before Dembele could get to it. 8 min: It\u2019s been a good open start, with Barcelona looking particularly dynamic. It looks like they\u2019re trying to subjugate their hosts early doors. Which isn\u2019t to say that Lyon have been dominated. 6 min: Point of order: I should have mentioned beforehand that Var is in use today, and will be in all matches fo the remainder of the competition. I was reminded of that by the ref, who has just reminded the players by making a TV motion to warn them they won\u2019t get away with any pulling or shoving when corner kicks are being delivered. 5 min: That\u2019s better from Aouar! His curling low shot from the edge of the area forces Ter Stegen to push it behind for a corner. 5 min: Messi clips the freekick over the wall ... and a couple of yards over the bar. The home crowd exhale. 4 min: Bar\u00e7a\u2019s press pays off: Sergi Roberto robs Aouar in midfield and then feeds Messi, who skitters towards the box. Aouar chases back but brings down the Argentinian from behind. Freekick just inside the D, perfectly central... 3 min: Lyon are trying to press Barcelona to disrupt their building from the back by Bar\u00e7a are good enough to play out so far. 1 min: Lyon-Barcelona is go! The visitors kick off ... and fire off a shot after 24 seconds! Dembele outpaced the home defence to chase down a pass over the top by Piqu\u00e9 and then let fly from the left-hand corner of the box. But he smashed the bouncing ball several yards wide of the far post. Whatever Mendy\u2019s injury is, it hasn\u2019t prevented him from starting: let\u2019s hope he\u2019s fit enough to play the whole match. The teams march out to a tremendous din and lots of coordinated flag-waving. Ouch! This could be a big blow for Lyon and those of us who were looking forward to seeing Mendy in action against Messi: the left-back has been injured in the warm-up and could be replaced by Mar\u00e7al. The atmosphere in the OL Stadium sounds pleasingly rambunctious. The surprise is Lyon\u2019s lineup is Martin Terrier, who\u2019ll play on the left wing instead of Maxwell Cornet. That\u2019s a bit of a turn-up because Cornet has been particularly good in big games this season but 21-year-old Terrier has impressed in recent outings (with Rafa Benitez among those impressed, as he had design on bringing him to Newcastle). \u201cDenayer has been phenomenal for Lyon and the outstanding moment just has to be his flying header goalline clearance against PSG a couple of weeks ago,\u201d says Kari Tulinius, fluffing his pompoms to full effect.. \u201cEvery Lyon game I\u2019ve watched this season has been phenomenal, hope this one is too. Enjoy!\u201d I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve mainly seen their big games? Because, as mentioned, they have a pleasing habit of turning it on in those. It\u2019s a sad that F\u00e9kir\u2019s missing but we can still hope for top showing from Depay, Aouar, Mendy and Ndombele and Dembele: Lyon sure have enough talent to trouble Bar\u00e7a who, by the same token, have the ability to kill the tie today. The last time Lyon hosted Barcelona, in 2009, they scored (in a 1-1 draw) thanks to this masterpiece by the one true king of freekicks, Juninho Pernambucano. Go to 00:51 in this video and marvel at the utter discombobulation of Victor Vald\u00e9s. There are goalkeepers who must still wake in a cold sweat thinking of what Juninho did to them (for more on him, read this if you fancy). Good news for Lyon as Jason Denayer has overcome thigh bother and is fit enough to take his place in central defence, where he has been in top form recently. Lyon: Lopes; Dubois, Marcelo, Denayer, Mendy; Ndomb\u00e9l\u00e9, Aouar; Terrier, Depay, Traor\u00e9; Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 Subs: Gorgelin, Mar\u00e7al, Tete, Cheikh, Solet, Cornet, Tousart Barcelona: Ter Stegen; Semedo, Piqu\u00e9, Lenglet, Alba; Sergi Roberto, Busquets, Rakitic; Messi, Suarez, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 Subs: Pena, Coutinho, Malcom, Murillo, Vidal, Umtiti, Alena Referee: C Cakir (Tur) Hello and welcome to the only last 16 tie between two teams who were unbeaten in the group stages. Barcelona, you will remember, swept to the top of a group that included Spurs, Inter and PSV, while Lyon finished second below Manchester City despite winning away to Pep Guardiola\u2019s side. Oddly, all of Lyon\u2019s home matches in the group stage ended 2-2: Barcelona would probably take that today, since it would leave them as heavy favourites to finish the job at the Camp Nou. On the other hand, there is a clear opportunity for them to take an even bigger advantage from this first leg because suspension deprives Lyon of their snazzy playmaker, Nabil F\u00e9kir. But Lyon do still have some fine players as well as a habit of producing their best against the most formidable opponents. And this Bar\u00e7a side are vulnerable. Indeed, Bar\u00e7a have not won any of their last five away knockout matches in this competition and in their last one \u2013 against Roma last season \u2013 they were blown away. So there should be opportunities for both teams today and we can expect them to go at each other with gusto. We can look forward, in particular, to the duel between Lionel Messi and Ferland Mendy, the 23-year-old left-back whom Bar\u00e7a are known to admire. All in all, we\u2019ve got ourselves a potential humdinger.",

      "bodyText": "The row over the fate of Shamima Begum, the British-born teenager who travelled from east London to Syria to join Islamic State in 2015, has taken a further twist as the home secretary ordered she be deprived of her British citizenship. Sajid Javid has sought to adopt a tough stance in respect of Begum\u2019s case but he was immediately faced with the prospect of a legal battle as Tasnime Akunjee, a lawyer for her relatives, said they were \u201cconsidering all legal avenues to challenge the decision\u201d, that had left them \u201cvery disappointed\u201d. Begum was 15 when she left her home in Bethnal Green and is now in a refugee camp in Syria, where she gave birth to a boy at the weekend. The 19-year-old had called on the British people to have sympathy for her and asked to be allowed to return to the UK. But Javid insisted he would do all in his power to prevent her coming back. The Guardian understands the home secretary thinks section 40(2) of the British Nationality Act 1981 gives him the power to strip Begum of her UK citizenship. He wrote to her family informing them he had made such an order, believing the fact her parents are of Bangladeshi heritage means she can apply for citizenship of that country \u2013 though Begum says she has never visited it. This is crucial because, while the law bars him from making a person stateless, it allows him to remove citizenship if he can show Begum has behaved \u201cin a manner which is seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the UK\u201d and he has \u201creasonable grounds for believing that the person is able, under the law of a country or territory outside the UK, to become a national of such a country or territory\u201d. Begum has 28 days from when the order was made to appeal to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission against Javid\u2019s interpretation of his powers. The move is likely to prove highly controversial, with legal sources claiming on Tuesday night that the commission had thrown out previous attempts by the government in similar circumstances to strip citizenship. The human rights campaign group Liberty said Javid must observe the \u201cfundamental principles of due process and the rule of law upon which we all rely\u201d, while meeting his obligation to keep the public safe. A spokesman said: \u201cThe government has an array of powers available to it to deal with people suspected of involvement in terrorism \u2013 including the criminal law. Taking away a person\u2019s citizenship is one of the most serious among them and must not be wielded lightly.\u201d He added that the Home Office\u2019s response \u201cmust include a serious look at how a 15 year-old girl was apparently able to leave the country to join a proscribed group without effective action being taken to safeguard her\u201d. On Tuesday evening, a Home Office spokesman said: \u201cIn recent days, the home secretary has clearly stated that his priority is the safety and security of Britain and the people who live here. In order to protect this country, he has the power to deprive someone of their British citizenship where it would not render them stateless. \u201cWe do not comment on individual cases, but any decisions to deprive individuals of their citizenship are based on all available evidence and not taken lightly.\u201d ITV News, which published the letter it said was sent to Begum\u2019s mother on Tuesday, said the Home Office had urged Begum\u2019s family to make her aware of the decision, adding that she had a right to appeal. Begum left the UK along with two schoolfriends and her case was thrust back into the spotlight last week, when she declared her wish to return for the sake of her child in an interview with the Times. In a Sky News interview the following Sunday, she said: \u201cI feel a lot of people should have sympathy for me, for everything I\u2019ve been through. You know, I didn\u2019t know what I was getting into when I left ... I was hoping that maybe for the sake of me and my child they let me come back.\u201d But Javid made clear his fierce opposition to her return. Responding to an urgent question in the Commons on Monday he said: \u201cCertainly, anyone that went to support terrorism in any way whatsoever, we are not going to risk the lives of any British officials \u2013 soldiers or anyone \u2013 to help them or rescue them.\u201d Javid told MPs more than 900 people had travelled from the UK to Syria or Iraq. \u201cWhatever role they took in the so-called caliphate, they all supported a terrorist organisation and in doing so they have shown they hate our country and the values we stand for.\u201d He added that he had the power to ban foreign nationals from the country and to strip \u201cdangerous dual nationals\u201d of their British citizenship. \u201cOver 100 people have already been deprived in this way,\u201d he said. Javid can also use temporary exclusion orders to bar the return of jihadists for up to two years. He said that Britons who do return to the UK \u201cwill be questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted\u201d. In the view of the family\u2019s lawyer, the advice that Begum\u2019s Bangladeshi heritage can be used to deprive her of UK citizenship is incorrect. \u201cOur view is that this would be illegal because they would make her a stateless person, in breach of international law. We are surprised the home secretary does not understand international law, or care about international law,\u201d said Akunjee, when the prospect was raised last week. \u201cIf he were to attempt to put such orders on, we would explore all legal options to block his unlawful actions or appeal. If we can get an injunction, we will.\u201d After the decision was announced, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 home affairs spokesman, Ed Davey, said: \u201cMembership of a terrorist group is a serious crime, as is encouraging or supporting terrorism. But Shamima Begum should face justice for those crimes in the UK. \u201cIt is not only hard to see Ms Begum and her baby as constituting a serious threat to national security, but it also seems a huge wasted opportunity. We can learn lessons as to why a young girl went to Syria in the first place; lessons which could improve Britain\u2019s security by helping us prevent this happening again.\u201d The Labour MP, Stella Creasy, said: \u201cHowever horrific her defence of Isis, if the home secretary can start with stripping this woman and her week-old child of their citizenship for his leadership bid, where does it end?\u201d Creasy added that she too would prefer to see Begum dealt with by the domestic justice system. The Conservative chair of the Commons education committee, Robert Halfon, who had spoken out against allowing Begum to return, said Javid had made \u201cabsolutely the right decision\u201d. \u2022 This article was updated on 20 February 2019 to note that Shamima Begum was born in Britain.",

      "bodyText": "Australians spent $9.3bn last year on cocaine, meth, MDMA and heroin, with cocaine and meth consumption rising from previous years. Analysis of wastewater shows how much of each of the drugs is being consumed around the country, underlining the size of the black market. The Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission on Wednesday released its sixth national wastewater drug monitoring program report, which monitored 58 wastewater stations in July and August 2018. It estimates more than 9.6 tonnes of methylamphetamine was consumed in Australia in the year to August 2018, along with four tonnes of cocaine, 1.1 tonnes of MDMA, and more than 700kg of heroin. \u201cIt is astounding that Australians waste over $9.3bn a year on drugs,\u201d the commission chief executive, Michael Phelan, said on Wednesday. \u201cThis is money people could be spending on legitimate goods for themselves and their families.\u201d The report also looked at cannabis consumption, which regional Australia uses at double the rate of city dwellers. In the second year of the testing program, the commission found cocaine and meth consumption were up, but MDMA and heroin were down. Phelan said a drop in fentanyl use across regional areas was a positive sign. The report covers 56% of the population, which equates to about 13 million people. The tests look for 13 substances, including nicotine, alcohol and opioids. The Northern Territory reported the highest average cannabis consumption in regional Australia, as well as the highest MDMA consumption of capital cities. It also recorded the highest nicotine and alcohol consumption across both capital cities and regional sites. New South Wales and Victoria continued to be the capitals for cocaine and heroin respectively, while the Australian Capital Territory returned the second highest average capital city consumption of opioids such as heroin, fentanyl and oxycodone. Using wastewater data from between August 2017 and August 2018, the commission estimates that more than 9.6 tonnes of methylamphetamine is consumed in Australia each year, as well as more than four tonnes of cocaine, 1.1 tonnes of MDMA, and more than 700kg of heroin. The quantity represents a street value of about $9.3bn, which the commission said underlines \u201cthe size of the black economy that relates to illicit drugs alone\u201d. Wednesday\u2019s release marks the first time cannabis had been included in the wastewater study, revealing that regional areas consume on average more than their capital city counterparts. Phelan said it provided \u201cfurther insight into one of the largest illicit drug markets in Australia\u201d. \u201cOn a national level, of the drugs measured by the program with available dose data, alcohol and nicotine remain the highest-consumed substances,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the program continues to build long-term drug consumption data, fluctuations in consumption are evident. Understanding local drug consumption patterns assists law enforcement, policy, regulatory and health agencies develop targeted supply, demand and harm-reduction strategies.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Now that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/20/bernie-sanders-2020-presidential-campaign-fundraising\">Bernie Sanders is officially in the 2020 presidential race</a>, it\u2019s time to face the obvious truth: not only can he beat Donald Trump, he is also a better candidate to do so than any of the other current Democratic contenders.</p> <p>At a critical moment when the left needs to unify in order to end Trump\u2019s reign of cruelty and ineptitude, Sanders is the person for the job. Nobody else comes close.</p> <p>For the last two years, Sanders has been setting the Democratic party policy agenda. His 2016 candidacy entirely shifted the political landscape, to the point where the majority of Democrats <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/402251-bernie-sanders-socialism-moves-to-democratic-mainstream\">now view Democratic socialism favorably</a>. Medicare for All and universal free college are so popular that they have almost become litmus tests for prospective candidates. In polls, Sanders is well ahead of the other <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/dem_pres_primary/\">currently declared candidates</a>, and at this point he should be treated as the presumptive frontrunner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/11/sign-up-for-the-best-of-opinion-us-daily-email\">See things from another point of view. Sign up for the US opinion email</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ironically given his age, Sanders has been embraced by millennials \u2013 even millennial women preferred Sanders over Clinton. The face of the young left, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is a <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-grassroots-organizing-washington_us_5b332251e4b0b745f178e159\">veteran of the first Sanders campaign</a>. It makes sense. Young people have a sense of urgency about the future: we don\u2019t want to live in a \u201cneo-feudal\u201d world in which corporations tell cities what to do, nor do we want to live on a ruined planet. We want our children and grandchildren never to have to worry about being unable to afford medical care. We want their public schools to be well-funded and their cities to be above water. We also want to be able to afford to have children in the first place.</p> <p>The reasons that people on the left should support Sanders are obvious. Since his earliest days <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ShaunKing/you-dont-really-know-who-bernie-sanders-was-in-the-1960s-79628016125f\">getting arrested for protesting segregation</a>, Sanders has shown a firm commitment to advancing a progressive agenda. He\u2019s someone we can trust: he has been \u201con message\u201d for four decades, sounding pretty much <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU3NKvvxcSs\">the same over decades of speeches</a>. He\u2019s not someone whose ideals seem to have emerged conveniently just in time for their presidential campaign.</p> <p>But even those who do not share Democratic socialist instincts should get behind Sanders.

      "bodyText": "Now that Bernie Sanders is officially in the 2020 presidential race, it\u2019s time to face the obvious truth: not only can he beat Donald Trump, he is also a better candidate to do so than any of the other current Democratic contenders. At a critical moment when the left needs to unify in order to end Trump\u2019s reign of cruelty and ineptitude, Sanders is the person for the job. Nobody else comes close. For the last two years, Sanders has been setting the Democratic party policy agenda. His 2016 candidacy entirely shifted the political landscape, to the point where the majority of Democrats now view Democratic socialism favorably. Medicare for All and universal free college are so popular that they have almost become litmus tests for prospective candidates. In polls, Sanders is well ahead of the other currently declared candidates, and at this point he should be treated as the presumptive frontrunner. Ironically given his age, Sanders has been embraced by millennials \u2013 even millennial women preferred Sanders over Clinton. The face of the young left, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is a veteran of the first Sanders campaign. It makes sense. Young people have a sense of urgency about the future: we don\u2019t want to live in a \u201cneo-feudal\u201d world in which corporations tell cities what to do, nor do we want to live on a ruined planet. We want our children and grandchildren never to have to worry about being unable to afford medical care. We want their public schools to be well-funded and their cities to be above water. We also want to be able to afford to have children in the first place. The reasons that people on the left should support Sanders are obvious. Since his earliest days getting arrested for protesting segregation, Sanders has shown a firm commitment to advancing a progressive agenda. He\u2019s someone we can trust: he has been \u201con message\u201d for four decades, sounding pretty much the same over decades of speeches. He\u2019s not someone whose ideals seem to have emerged conveniently just in time for their presidential campaign. But even those who do not share Democratic socialist instincts should get behind Sanders. He\u2019s a pragmatic choice. Nobody is better positioned to take on Donald Trump. Sanders has name recognition and widespread popularity. He knows how to campaign well, has a network of organizers, and can pack stadiums. He does well at town halls and in debates against Republicans. Since 2016, polls consistently show him beating Trump. Initially, there were those who doubted these numbers, saying that as voters got to know Sanders they would turn away from his radicalism. This turned out to be false. As voters got to know him, they liked him. His signature policy proposals have achieved widespread popularity among both Democratic and Republican voters.

He has gotten better at speaking on issues of racial justice, and in both books and interviews he speaks forcefully about the unique systemic harms faced by people of color. He has been a leader on both domestic and foreign policy, getting Amazon to raise its minimum wage and successfully pushing the Senate to cut off aid for Saudi Arabia\u2019s atrocious war in Yemen.

Ofsted rated the school as inadequate on all counts, the third time it has been given its lowest rating since 2014.</p> <p>\u201cSafeguarding concerns raised by some pupils during the inspection are being investigated by the appropriate public bodies. Ofsted does not have the power to investigate concerns of this kind,\u201d Ofsted reported in its <a href=\"https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/27/100289\">conclusion of the inspection</a>.</p> <p>Talmud Torah Yetev Lev did not answer requests for a response.</p> <p>The school, near Stamford Hill, has an Orthodox Jewish ethos and is registered to admit 567 boys aged between two and 12. However, the inspectors discovered more than 1,200 pupils on the school\u2019s roll, including pupils aged 13 and 14, in breach of its registration as an independent school.</p> <p>Jewish schools have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/oct/14/jewish-schools-complain-ofsted-inspections\">long complained</a> of being disproportionately targeted by Ofsted, especially over new regulations involving the teaching of fundamental British values. In 2017 Ofsted gave inadequate grades to a group of Orthodox Jewish schools, including the Vishnitz Girls and Yesodey Hatorah schools in Stamford Hill, for failing to promote respect and tolerance.</p> <p>The inspectors\u2019 findings underline Ofsted and the Department for Education\u2019s lack of powers to directly intervene in private schools, despite repeated inadequate classifications. It follows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/feb/13/two-state-steiner-schools-face-possible-closure-or-takeover\">similar concerns about safeguarding and management</a> at a string of state and private Steiner schools.</p> <p>The Talmud Torah Yetev Lev inspection report included alarming details of poor supervision of children as young as four and five: \u201cIn reception, leaders and adults do not supervise children effectively to ensure they play and learn safely. For instance, inspectors observed children standing on tables and chairs and playing on staircases.\u201d</p> <p>The report also found \u201cserious health and safety hazards\u201d at one of the school\u2019s sites, and that one of its buildings was unsafe, while pupils were seen running through corridors even when adults were present.

Much of the school day is taken up with religious study, with secular subjects studied for just 90 minutes each afternoon.</p> <p>But the inspectors did praise the school for the quality of its religious teaching and the positive attitude of pupils: \u201cThe teaching of the religious curriculum is effective and contributes positively to pupils\u2019 spiritual, moral, social and cultural development.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the safeguarding concerns, pupils told inspectors they felt safe from bullying and able to speak to staff to resolve any problems.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A safeguarding investigation is under way at a private Jewish primary school in north London after pupils reported being pinched and slapped by staff as punishment. Ofsted inspectors who visited Talmud Torah Yetev Lev school, in north London, last month were told by pupils that \u201cinappropriate physical contact\u201d was used to manage pupil behaviour at the boys-only school. \u201cOf greatest concern is that pupils reported that physical sanctions are adopted by staff in the event of pupil misbehaviour, including cheek pinching, smacking and slapping,\u201d the inspectors said in their report. The Ofsted inspectors reported their concerns to the local authority, Hackney, after their unannounced visit in late January. Ofsted rated the school as inadequate on all counts, the third time it has been given its lowest rating since 2014. \u201cSafeguarding concerns raised by some pupils during the inspection are being investigated by the appropriate public bodies. Ofsted does not have the power to investigate concerns of this kind,\u201d Ofsted reported in its conclusion of the inspection. Talmud Torah Yetev Lev did not answer requests for a response. The school, near Stamford Hill, has an Orthodox Jewish ethos and is registered to admit 567 boys aged between two and 12. However, the inspectors discovered more than 1,200 pupils on the school\u2019s roll, including pupils aged 13 and 14, in breach of its registration as an independent school. Jewish schools have long complained of being disproportionately targeted by Ofsted, especially over new regulations involving the teaching of fundamental British values. In 2017 Ofsted gave inadequate grades to a group of Orthodox Jewish schools, including the Vishnitz Girls and Yesodey Hatorah schools in Stamford Hill, for failing to promote respect and tolerance. The inspectors\u2019 findings underline Ofsted and the Department for Education\u2019s lack of powers to directly intervene in private schools, despite repeated inadequate classifications. It follows similar concerns about safeguarding and management at a string of state and private Steiner schools. The Talmud Torah Yetev Lev inspection report included alarming details of poor supervision of children as young as four and five: \u201cIn reception, leaders and adults do not supervise children effectively to ensure they play and learn safely. For instance, inspectors observed children standing on tables and chairs and playing on staircases.\u201d The report also found \u201cserious health and safety hazards\u201d at one of the school\u2019s sites, and that one of its buildings was unsafe, while pupils were seen running through corridors even when adults were present. Attendance records were described as \u201cdisorganised and unreliable\u201d. Inspectors noted a pile of rubbish and large holes in the playground surface at one site, which the school\u2019s leaders rectified once the problems had been brought to their attention. Ofsted also found that much of the quality of teaching and learning by pupils was inadequate. Much of the school day is taken up with religious study, with secular subjects studied for just 90 minutes each afternoon. But the inspectors did praise the school for the quality of its religious teaching and the positive attitude of pupils: \u201cThe teaching of the religious curriculum is effective and contributes positively to pupils\u2019 spiritual, moral, social and cultural development.\u201d Despite the safeguarding concerns, pupils told inspectors they felt safe from bullying and able to speak to staff to resolve any problems.",

A new trailer offers a first look at the troubling two-part, four-hour film that premiered at Sundance film festival last month, featuring the testimonies of James Safechuck and Wade Robson, who allege that Jackson sexually abused them as children. \u201cHe told me if they ever found out what we were doing, he and I would go to jail,\u201d says Robson in the trailer.

      "bodyText": "The controversial Sydney broadcaster Alan Jones has delivered an on-air apology to Malcolm Turnbull for branding him a \u201ctraitor to the nation\u201d during a program broadcast by Sky News in February. Jones delivered the unqualified apology, which is understood to be in response to a lawyer\u2019s letter from the former prime minister, at the start of his television show, Jones and Co, on Tuesday night. \u201cI went too far in my criticism,\u201d Jones told his viewers. \u201cI accused Mr Turnbull of being a traitor to the nation. \u201cI acknowledge that I had no justification for making that false statement and I unreservedly apologise to Mr Turnbull for doing so.\u201d Jones has been a longtime, voluble critic of Turnbull, and lashed out on 5 February in response to positive comments the former prime minister had made about the former Liberal and now independent Julia Banks. Turnbull endorsed Banks\u2019 decision to run in the Victorian seat of Flinders against the government frontbencher Greg Hunt at the coming federal election. \u201cShe came to parliament with a life\u2019s experience as a lawyer in the business world,\u201d he told reporters in Melbourne. \u201cShe is really an outstanding representative. \u201cShe\u2019s explained why she left the Liberal party and she\u2019s done so on her own terms and I respect the decision she\u2019s taken.\u201d Turnbull\u2019s endorsement triggered an on-air rant from an irate Jones, in which he accused the former prime minister of being a traitor to the nation. Guardian Australia understands Turnbull threatened to begin legal proceedings against the broadcaster unless an apology was forthcoming. The possibility of Jones being embroiled in fresh legal proceedings followed the Wagner defamation case last year. Jones was found to have defamed the Toowoomba-based family and was ordered to pay costs. The broadcaster had made repeated on-air claims that the family had covered up their culpability in the 2011 Grantham floods in 2014 and 2015. The Wagner brothers sought $4.8m in damages during a seven-week defamation trial, which resulted in a $3.7m payout from Jones and two radio stations, 4BC and 2GB, which are owned by Macquarie Media. The court ruled that Jones had been \u201cwilfully blind to the truth\u201d when he made \u201cvicious and spiteful\u201d comments about the family.",

      "bodyText": "The founder of one of the first big companies to switch to a four-day working week has called on others to follow, claiming it has resulted in a 20% rise in productivity, appeared to have helped increase profits and improved staff wellbeing. Analysis of one of the biggest trials yet of the four-day working week has revealed no fall in output, reduced stress and increased staff engagement, fuelling hopes that a better work-life balance for millions could be in sight. Perpetual Guardian, a New Zealand financial services company, switched its 240 staff from a five-day to a four-day week last November and maintained their pay. Productivity increased in the four days they worked so there was no drop in the total amount of work done, a study of the trial released on Tuesday has revealed. The trial was monitored by academics at the University of Auckland and Auckland University of Technology. Among the Perpetual Guardian staff they found scores given by workers about leadership, stimulation, empowerment and commitment all increased compared with a 2017 survey. Details of an earlier trial showed the biggest increases were in commitment and empowerment. Staff stress levels were down from 45% to 38%. Work-life balance scores increased from 54% to 78%. \u201cThis is an idea whose time has come,\u201d said Andrew Barnes, Perpetual Guardian\u2019s founder and chief executive. \u201cWe need to get more companies to give it a go. They will be surprised at the improvement in their company, their staff and in their wider community.\u201d He has this week released a how-to-guide for other organisations, including findings from the trial and implementation. \u201cWe\u2019ve been treated like adults and I think as a result everyone is behaving like adults,\u201d said Tammy Barker, a branch manager who was part of the trial that cut the working week from from 37.5 hours to 30. The eight-week experiment was closely watched by employers and policymakers around the world. In the UK, the Wellcome Trust science funding body is considering switching its 800 head office staff to a four-day week, and Perpetual Guardian has been inundated with more than 350 requests for information about the trial from 28 countries. Most have come from organisations in the UK, followed by Australia, the US and Germany. The Labour party has commissioned a study of the possibilities of a four-day week. However, early research points to the complexity of achieving productivity gains in major industries such as retail, where being present is a key part of the job. In the UK, average working hours have been increasing since the financial crisis, and questions have been raised about how far people working in frontline occupations such as nursing or the police could cut their hours without reducing the public service they provide. Smaller companies experimenting with the four-day week have found performance has been better in the first few weeks as excitement about the project took hold, before falling slightly. \u201cThe biggest concern from an employer point of view is ensuring that the full-time introduction of the policy doesn\u2019t lead to complacency, with the risk that people\u2019s productivity will slip back,\u201d Barker said. \u201cTo guard against this happening we\u2019ve spent a lot of time making sure every person in every team has their own plan as to how they\u2019re going to maintain and even improve their productivity.\u201d She said she had personally found that working less increased her focus on tasks, and she was no longer jumping from one thing to the next. \u201cI was actually finishing projects before moving on to the next one, and by the end of the day found I was accomplishing more than trying to multitask everything,\u201d she said. \u201cI did find that my productivity increased purely by being more aware of my work processes and thinking about how I was doing things and why I was doing them. At the same time, I didn\u2019t feel any more stressed at work probably because I was really focusing on the tasks at hand and because I had the extra day off to compensate for the increased work rate.\u201d People used the additional day off for some of the same leisure activity they would have done at the weekend, such as golf or watching Netflix, but new activities emerged too, according to Jarrod Haar, a professor of human resource management at Auckland University of Technology. These included \u201cspending time with parents\u201d, \u201cspending much-needed time studying\u201d, and \u201ccleaning the house on a Wednesday and then having the weekend free\u201d. \u201cManagers reported their teams were more creative after the trial,\u201d he said. \u201cIt involved them finding solutions to doing their work in four days, so this reflected well.

In particular, many thought Trump hurt his own case by admitting, right there in the White House Rose Garden: \u201cI didn\u2019t need to do this, but I\u2019d rather do it much faster.\u201d \u201cThis quote should be the first sentence of the first paragraph of every complaint filed this afternoon,\u201d tweeted George Conway, a top Washington lawyer and the husband of Trump aide Kellyanne Conway. \u201cYup,\u201d replied Preet Bharara, the former US attorney. But legal analysts from across the political spectrum have now said that line of argument might not be as strong as it appears on its face, and that the Trump administration might have a better case for the emergency declaration than it seems. \u201cThe legality of Trump\u2019s decision will probably turn on highly technical provisions involving the use of funds for military construction projects,\u201d wrote Harvard law professor Cass Sunstein, a former White House official under Barack Obama. Legal challenges to Trump\u2019s emergency declaration quickly materialized, with three Texas landowners and an environmental group suing on Friday, 16 state attorneys general suing on Monday and Democrats in Congress promising at least one lawsuit to come. As predicted, the lawsuits indeed quoted Trump, with the states\u2019 coalition arguing that \u201cthe president candidly admitted that the emergency declaration reflected his personal preference to construct the wall more quickly, rather than an actual urgent need for it to be built immediately\u201d. But courts are not likely to rule, Sunstein wrote, on whether the underlying immigration crisis as described by Trump qualifies as an \u201cemergency,\u201d which is not defined in the 1976 National Emergencies Act invoked by Trump in making his declaration. Jack Goldsmith, Sunstein\u2019s colleague at Harvard and a veteran of the justice department under George W Bush, said presidents have broad leeway in declaring emergencies. \u201c\u2018Emergency\u2019 isn\u2019t typically defined in relevant law, presidents have always had discretion to decide if there\u2019s an emergency, and they\u2019ve often declared emergencies under circumstances short of necessity, to address a real problem but not an emergency as understood in common parlance,\u201d Goldsmith tweeted.

In its reasoning, the White House invoked a a US law stating that under a declared national emergency (or a declaration of war), the secretary of defense can undertake \u201cmilitary construction projects \u2026 not otherwise authorized by law.\u201d The White House also invoked a second law that authorized the secretary of defense to support the \u201cconstruction of roads and fences and installation of lighting to block drug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United States\u201d. South Texas college of law professor Josh Blackman, a conservative analyst, wrote that Congress had clearly ceded to the president the power \u201cto shift appropriations around to fund that construction\u201d and that Trump\u2019s invocation of the the drug-smuggling law \u201creflects, once again, an instance where he relies on express delegations of power to accomplish awful policies\u201d. In a point echoed by Sunstein, University of Texas law professor Steve Vladeck said the fate of Trump\u2019s emergency declaration likely rests on a relatively narrow reading of law. \u201cThe legal dispute won\u2019t be over whether there really is an \u2018emergency\u2019,\u201d Vladeck tweeted. \u201cIt will be over whether the statutory authorities an emergency declaration unlocks actually authorize wall construction.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The need to be \u201cultra, ultra careful\u201d with the horse of a lifetime was behind the late decision not to run Presenting Percy last weekend but there is still a 50% chance, according to his owner, that the rarely sighted Magners Gold Cup favourite could run this weekend. Philip Reynolds dismissed any suggestion of a problem affecting his star on the same day that another horse he owns, Tin Soldier, was dramatically cut in the market for another Cheltenham Festival race, the Pertemps Final. Along with the reclusive Athenry-based trainer Pat Kelly, Reynolds has been a winner at the last three Festivals, thanks to the efforts of Mall Dini and Presenting Percy. It is an incredible record at the sport\u2019s biggest race meeting for previously low-profile connections and they now appear to have bright prospects of extending that run in three weeks\u2019 time. \u201cPresenting Percy is absolutely fine,\u201d said Reynolds. \u201cWe could have ran him last weekend and we may well run him at Fairyhouse on Saturday.

But then again, too few too mention. Did someone say that seven MPs had resigned from the Labour party? Well, it was no big deal. He\u2019d never really cared for any of them. Who were they again? Oh yes, there was that Luciana woman who had been droning on about antisemitism for years. Thank God he\u2019d never bothered to talk to her. And the rest were just a bunch of pro-EU Blairite losers. Good riddance to the lot of them.</p> <p>And if there were any other Labour MPs out there who wanted to join them they were welcome to walk. Sod \u2018em. They could all be replaced easily enough. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/18/chuka-umunna-and-other-mps-set-to-quit-labour-party\">Tom Watson</a> and John McDonnell had asked him to reflect and listen and he\u2019d done just that. He\u2019d reflected and listened and decided that everything was pretty much tickety-boo. His policies were just fine, he was just fine. It wasn\u2019t him that had to change, it was everyone else. Always had been, always would be. You didn\u2019t get a caring Labour party by falling over yourself to be nice to people. Meet the new Jeremy. Same as the old Jeremy.</p> <p>The Labour leader wasn\u2019t the only politician to be in denial. At the beginning of his statement to the Commons on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/18/workers-blame-brexit-for-demise-of-hondas-swindon-plant\">Honda\u2019s decision to end production in Swindon</a>, the business secretary, Greg Clark, had done his best to talk about anything but Brexit. Honda had said the closure was nothing to do with Brexit and who was he to contradict them?</p> <p>Slowly, though, the scales of self-deceit began to fall away. Clark is at heart a decent man and can\u2019t maintain the cognitive dissonance of talking stuff he knows to be bollocks for any length of time.</p> <p>His breaking point came when Suella Braverman, one of the more intellectually challenged of the Tory backbenchers whose only positive contribution to the country has been to resign as a minister, declared it was a complete coincidence that so much economic bad news happened to be breaking while the government screwed up Brexit. </p> <p>This was too much for Clark. He placed his hands over his ears, begging her to stop. What bit of a no-deal Brexit being a complete catastrophe did she not understand? Of course the uncertainty over Brexit was a factor in overseas businesses pulling out of the UK. It was a no-brainer. He had been on his knees begging Theresa May to face down the ERG and do something sensible in the national interest. But if nothing changed then S Club 7 might just become S Club 8. </p>",

Tom Watson and John McDonnell had asked him to reflect and listen and he\u2019d done just that. He\u2019d reflected and listened and decided that everything was pretty much tickety-boo. His policies were just fine, he was just fine. It wasn\u2019t him that had to change, it was everyone else. Always had been, always would be. You didn\u2019t get a caring Labour party by falling over yourself to be nice to people. Meet the new Jeremy. Same as the old Jeremy. The Labour leader wasn\u2019t the only politician to be in denial. At the beginning of his statement to the Commons on Honda\u2019s decision to end production in Swindon, the business secretary, Greg Clark, had done his best to talk about anything but Brexit. Honda had said the closure was nothing to do with Brexit and who was he to contradict them? Slowly, though, the scales of self-deceit began to fall away. Clark is at heart a decent man and can\u2019t maintain the cognitive dissonance of talking stuff he knows to be bollocks for any length of time. His breaking point came when Suella Braverman, one of the more intellectually challenged of the Tory backbenchers whose only positive contribution to the country has been to resign as a minister, declared it was a complete coincidence that so much economic bad news happened to be breaking while the government screwed up Brexit. This was too much for Clark. He placed his hands over his ears, begging her to stop. What bit of a no-deal Brexit being a complete catastrophe did she not understand? Of course the uncertainty over Brexit was a factor in overseas businesses pulling out of the UK. It was a no-brainer. He had been on his knees begging Theresa May to face down the ERG and do something sensible in the national interest. But if nothing changed then S Club 7 might just become S Club 8.",

At the second Woolmark prize, in 1954, he won the best coat category at the age of 21. While this achievement showed Lagerfeld\u2019s precocious talent, his rival \u2013 Yves Saint Laurent \u2013 was already on the scene, winning best dress design at just 18. Throughout their lives, the two men were great friends and rivals in both work and love. Saint Laurent was the subject of one of Lagerfeld\u2019s famous put-downs. \u201cHe is very middle-of-the-road French, very <em>pied-noir</em>, very provincial,\u201d he said in 1984.</p> <h2>1965, joins Fendi<br>A designer with staying power</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"432b6463db9d14351a8d0f5029a56e940c956130\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/432b6463db9d14351a8d0f5029a56e940c956130/0_493_4370_3660/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lagerfeld with the five Fendi sisters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"838\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lagerfeld with the five Fendi sisters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vittoriano Rastelli/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lagerfeld spent an astonishing, world-record-breaking 54 years at Italian house Fendi, producing more than 100 collections for it. This is a lifetime in an industry where designers, like football managers, are ditched after only months in charge. The young designer was, at the time, a freelancer working for Krizia and Charles Jourdan. The Fendi sisters hired him to bring some youth to the fur-centric Italian brand and he delivered, with tufted, dyed and shaved fur coats, the opposite of the grown-up floorlength minks seen at the time. In the process \u2013 and over the decades \u2013 he became enemy No 1 of animal rights groups. Peta\u2019s UK director Mimi Bekhechi called him \u201can undertaker\u201d. Silvia Venturini Fendi, meanwhile, described him as \u201cmy mentor and my point of reference.\u201d</p> <h2>1973, features in Andy Warhol\u2019s L\u2019Amour<br>Quite the scene</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e4f77edc9d2b5ead7c98886006748098e34d693\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e4f77edc9d2b5ead7c98886006748098e34d693/0_49_670_402/500.jpg\" alt=\"Karl Lagerfeld in the Warhol film L\u2019Amour.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karl Lagerfeld in the Warhol film L\u2019Amour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the 70s, Lagerfeld was part of the Le Sept set, a group of Parisian bohemians for whom work and life \u2013 and often night and day \u2013 were happily blurred at the tiny Parisian nightclub. The designer was friends with Saint Laurent, the model Donna Jordan and the illustrator Antonio Lopez, and he met his lover of 18 years, Jacques de Bascher, about this time. Warhol, who could sniff out a glamorous set across oceans, immortalised Lagerfeld and friends in his film L\u2019Amour. Some of it was filmed in Lagerfeld\u2019s apartment, where the drama unfolds.

It was, however, his work for Chanel over 36 years that made him famous. His first show didn\u2019t wow the critics and was notable for its concentration on 20s silhouettes rather than the pastel skirt suits Chanel was known for. Women\u2019s Wear Daily wrote that Lagerfeld \u201ccommitted too many Chanel Dont\u2019s and not enough Do\u2019s\u201d in the collection. Over the next decades, the designer proved the critics wrong, as he reinvented the brand\u2019s double Cs, tweed and pearls time and time again. \u201cThe good thing about Chanel is it is an idea you can adapt to many things,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>1994, pop culture comes to Chanel<br>Baggy silhouettes on Parisian catwalk shock</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a29a64ce55eb814e41fd29caed0ba59a218a4f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a29a64ce55eb814e41fd29caed0ba59a218a4f2/0_0_3974_6000/662.jpg\" alt=\"Pop culture on Lagerfeld\u2019s Chanel catwalk, 1994.\" width=\"662\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lagerfeld brings pop culture to the Chanel catwalk, 1994.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Marineau/Conde Nast via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFashion is about today,\u201d said Lagerfeld in a 2007 New Yorker profile. The designer arguably owed his longevity to his ability to tap into the zeitgeist way beyond clothes. His collections have referenced everything from climate change to Amy Winehouse and modern feminism. This show is an early example of pop culture on Lagerfeld\u2019s Chanel catwalk. It featured the supermodels Kate Moss, Carla Bruni and Naomi Campbell in bucket hats, baggy trousers and denim. One model wore overalls and roller-skates. It was a long way from Chanel pre-Lagerfeld, something the designer said was only worn by \u201cParisian doctors\u2019 wives\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>2001, loses six-and-a-half stone</strong></h2> <h2><strong>The Lagerfeld look develops</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b766a51406436de12b75b98d0d07dc474afd6a02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b766a51406436de12b75b98d0d07dc474afd6a02/204_48_1459_875/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lagerfeld with the Dior Homme designer Hedi Slimane in 2001.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lagerfeld with the Dior Homme designer Hedi Slimane in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lagerfeld was one of the most recognisable fashion designers in the world \u2013 thanks to his uniform of black suit, white shirt, fingerless gloves, pompadour and sunglasses. This look came together in the noughties, combined with drastic weight loss. \u201cI suddenly wanted to wear clothes designed by Hedi Slimane,\u201d he said, referring to the Dior Homme designer whose suiting is notoriously made in tiny sizes. Lagerfeld stuck to his diet \u2013 no sugar, cheese or bread, around 10 cans of Diet Coke a day \u2013 continuously, with no temptation. \u201cI\u2019m like the animals in the forest,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t touch what they cannot eat.\u201d</p> <h2>2004, designs H&amp;M collection<br>Karl\u2019s look comes to the high street</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"821366848cd430adee669c84682dbcdaaef4eacc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/821366848cd430adee669c84682dbcdaaef4eacc/0_79_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lagerfeld\u2019s collection for H&amp;M,2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lagerfeld\u2019s collection for H&amp;M, 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ullstein Bild/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2004, the idea of a designer collaboration with a high-street brand \u2013 now commonplace \u2013 was a new concept. Lagerfeld \u2013 forever the multitasker \u2013 became the first designer to collaborate with H&amp;M in its now yearly collection. Taking inspiration from his own monochrome look, he also appeared in the advertising campaign with models. The collection was a great success, selling out within minutes. This was a one-off, however. Lagerfeld criticised the limited quantities of the items produced by the brand. \u201cIt is snobbery created by anti-snobbery,\u201d he said. His response wasn\u2019t entirely inclusive, however; a newly svelte Lagerfeld was also displeased that the chain had produced the collection in larger sizes.</p> <h2><strong>2007, Fendi comes to the Great Wall of China</strong><br><strong>Lagerfeld goes </strong><strong>east</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34f18d0bace0c92f8c8205ef99828d24da4eae8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34f18d0bace0c92f8c8205ef99828d24da4eae8e/0_147_2029_2853/711.jpg\" alt=\"Lagerfeld\u2019s Great Wall of China show for Fendi, 2007.\" width=\"711\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lagerfeld\u2019s Great Wall of China show for Fendi, 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew H Walker/Getty Images for Fendi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Western brands began to court Asian consumers in the noughties and Lagerfeld was ahead of the curve. He brought the Fendi show to the Great Wall of China in 2007, at a cost of more than $10m (\u00a38.8m) and a year\u2019s planning. It featured 88 looks \u2013 a number associated with prosperity in China \u2013 lots of red (for luck) and Chinese models.

      "bodyText": "1954, wins the Woolmark prize An overachiever and proud of it Karl Lagerfeld moved to Paris from his native Hamburg as a teenager and, although he had no formal fashion or art school education, soon made his mark. At the second Woolmark prize, in 1954, he won the best coat category at the age of 21. While this achievement showed Lagerfeld\u2019s precocious talent, his rival \u2013 Yves Saint Laurent \u2013 was already on the scene, winning best dress design at just 18. Throughout their lives, the two men were great friends and rivals in both work and love. Saint Laurent was the subject of one of Lagerfeld\u2019s famous put-downs. \u201cHe is very middle-of-the-road French, very pied-noir, very provincial,\u201d he said in 1984. 1965, joins Fendi A designer with staying power Lagerfeld spent an astonishing, world-record-breaking 54 years at Italian house Fendi, producing more than 100 collections for it. This is a lifetime in an industry where designers, like football managers, are ditched after only months in charge. The young designer was, at the time, a freelancer working for Krizia and Charles Jourdan. The Fendi sisters hired him to bring some youth to the fur-centric Italian brand and he delivered, with tufted, dyed and shaved fur coats, the opposite of the grown-up floorlength minks seen at the time. In the process \u2013 and over the decades \u2013 he became enemy No 1 of animal rights groups. Peta\u2019s UK director Mimi Bekhechi called him \u201can undertaker\u201d. Silvia Venturini Fendi, meanwhile, described him as \u201cmy mentor and my point of reference.\u201d 1973, features in Andy Warhol\u2019s L\u2019Amour Quite the scene By the 70s, Lagerfeld was part of the Le Sept set, a group of Parisian bohemians for whom work and life \u2013 and often night and day \u2013 were happily blurred at the tiny Parisian nightclub. The designer was friends with Saint Laurent, the model Donna Jordan and the illustrator Antonio Lopez, and he met his lover of 18 years, Jacques de Bascher, about this time. Warhol, who could sniff out a glamorous set across oceans, immortalised Lagerfeld and friends in his film L\u2019Amour. Some of it was filmed in Lagerfeld\u2019s apartment, where the drama unfolds. Lagerfeld played a version of himself and french-kisses with Jordan at one point. 1983, joins Chanel After Mademoiselle comes Karl Lagerfeld joined Chanel on a part-time basis in 1983, continuing to design for Chloe, Fendi and others. It was, however, his work for Chanel over 36 years that made him famous. His first show didn\u2019t wow the critics and was notable for its concentration on 20s silhouettes rather than the pastel skirt suits Chanel was known for. Women\u2019s Wear Daily wrote that Lagerfeld \u201ccommitted too many Chanel Dont\u2019s and not enough Do\u2019s\u201d in the collection. Over the next decades, the designer proved the critics wrong, as he reinvented the brand\u2019s double Cs, tweed and pearls time and time again. \u201cThe good thing about Chanel is it is an idea you can adapt to many things,\u201d he said. 1994, pop culture comes to Chanel Baggy silhouettes on Parisian catwalk shock \u201cFashion is about today,\u201d said Lagerfeld in a 2007 New Yorker profile. The designer arguably owed his longevity to his ability to tap into the zeitgeist way beyond clothes. His collections have referenced everything from climate change to Amy Winehouse and modern feminism. This show is an early example of pop culture on Lagerfeld\u2019s Chanel catwalk. It featured the supermodels Kate Moss, Carla Bruni and Naomi Campbell in bucket hats, baggy trousers and denim. One model wore overalls and roller-skates. It was a long way from Chanel pre-Lagerfeld, something the designer said was only worn by \u201cParisian doctors\u2019 wives\u201d. 2001, loses six-and-a-half stone The Lagerfeld look develops Lagerfeld was one of the most recognisable fashion designers in the world \u2013 thanks to his uniform of black suit, white shirt, fingerless gloves, pompadour and sunglasses. This look came together in the noughties, combined with drastic weight loss. \u201cI suddenly wanted to wear clothes designed by Hedi Slimane,\u201d he said, referring to the Dior Homme designer whose suiting is notoriously made in tiny sizes. Lagerfeld stuck to his diet \u2013 no sugar, cheese or bread, around 10 cans of Diet Coke a day \u2013 continuously, with no temptation. \u201cI\u2019m like the animals in the forest,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t touch what they cannot eat.\u201d 2004, designs H&amp;M collection Karl\u2019s look comes to the high street In 2004, the idea of a designer collaboration with a high-street brand \u2013 now commonplace \u2013 was a new concept. Lagerfeld \u2013 forever the multitasker \u2013 became the first designer to collaborate with H&amp;M in its now yearly collection. Taking inspiration from his own monochrome look, he also appeared in the advertising campaign with models. The collection was a great success, selling out within minutes. This was a one-off, however. Lagerfeld criticised the limited quantities of the items produced by the brand. \u201cIt is snobbery created by anti-snobbery,\u201d he said. His response wasn\u2019t entirely inclusive, however; a newly svelte Lagerfeld was also displeased that the chain had produced the collection in larger sizes. 2007, Fendi comes to the Great Wall of China Lagerfeld goes east Western brands began to court Asian consumers in the noughties and Lagerfeld was ahead of the curve. He brought the Fendi show to the Great Wall of China in 2007, at a cost of more than $10m (\u00a38.8m) and a year\u2019s planning. It featured 88 looks \u2013 a number associated with prosperity in China \u2013 lots of red (for luck) and Chinese models. Asked where the brand\u2019s show could go next, Silvia Fendi responded: \u201cMaybe the moon.\u201d You get the feeling Lagerfeld would have loved that idea. 2011, Choupette is born Lagerfeld\u2019s furry companion arrives There can\u2019t be many cats that boast a personal maid, travel by private jet, have their own book, an Instagram account, a Wikipedia page and a product line of their likeness. But Choupette is a special kind of feline. Given to Lagerfeld by the model Baptiste Giabiconi \u2013 who initially had Lagerfeld cat-sit Choupette while he was on holiday \u2013 she turned the designer into an alpha cat person. Lagerfeld told Numero magazine that Choupette stole his heart because \u201cshe is pretty to look at and has good poise, but her main quality is that she doesn\u2019t talk\u201d. In 2013, he proclaimed he would marry the cat if it was legal. Who will take over her care is as yet unknown. 2012, controversy over comments about Adele Lagerfeld\u2019s barbs get him into hot water As his career developed, Lagerfeld\u2019s reputation for put-downs grew, too. Stella McCartney\u2019s appointment at Chlo\u00e9 prompted the industry-famous comment: \u201cI think they should have taken a big name.

      "body": "<p>Imagine this: a British teenage girl is groomed online at the age of 15. Stay with her nationality for a moment. She is British. She is indoctrinated by one of the world\u2019s most brutal terrorist cults and within 10 days of fleeing her home country is married to an extremist fighter. Stay with her age for a moment. She is 15. Four years later, two of her children have died and she has escaped across the desert, nine months pregnant, to a refugee camp. There, aged 19, she gives birth. And now she is asking to come home.</p> <p>Remove the inflammatory dog-whistle references to Isis brides and jihadi runaways and how much more likely is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/14/the-guardian-view-on-shamima-begum-return-and-face-the-consequences\" title=\"\">Shamima Begum</a> to incite our pity and mercy? How much more likely are we to prioritise our duty of care to her as a British citizen? To treat the question of whether she poses a terrorist threat as one to be settled by the rule of law rather than trial by tabloid?</p> <p>But this is not how it\u2019s playing out. The home secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/16/shamima-begum-isis-extremism-expert-criticises-sajid-javid\" title=\"\">Sajid Javid</a>, for starters, has vowed that he will not hesitate in preventing Begum\u2019s return. We could be discussing how to meet our responsibility to a vulnerable citizen. Instead we are deciding whether a traumatised teenager who claims not to be fazed at the sight of a severed head in a bin is sorry enough for our compassion to kick in. Or worse. One newspaper proudly announced Begum should <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2019/02/17/shamina-begum-should-expect-no-sympathy-britain/\" title=\"\">\u201cexpect no sympathy from Britain\u201d</a>. That same newspaper ran a column that <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/02/14/sorry-heartless-little-jihadi-bride-made-bed-now-can-lie/\" title=\"\">read</a>: \u201cSorry my heartless little jihadi bride, but you made your bed and now you can lie in it.\u201d Begum may have compared the Manchester Arena bombing to western airstrikes (she also said it was wrong that innocent people were killed), but is it really a surprise that a woman who fled to Syria at the age of 15, has spent the last four years living alongside extremists and may still be radicalised, is not saying the things we would like her to say? Meanwhile, others are spouting precisely the kind of poison we would expect, like Piers Morgan whose message to Begum is simply to \u201cgo f*ck herself\u201d.</p> <p>When the three schoolgirls fled to Syria in 2015 (Begum is the only known survivor), the reaction was to \u201cother\u201d them so absolutely that neither the girls nor their actions could have anything to do with Britain or its values. They were evil; they knew exactly what they were doing; they deserved what was coming to them. But listen to what Begum said when asked what attracted her to Isis in the first place. \u201cThe way they showed how you can go and they will take care of you,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou can have your own family.\u201d That Begum sought such seemingly benign and uncontroversial values is a damning indictment of this country. In every sense, we are responsible for her.</p> <p>This disturbing case holds a mirror up to Britain. In it we see a reflection of the racist, vengeful, and weak society we are, as opposed to the strong, stable, tolerant, humane, or even baseline-functioning one some, unbelievably, still claim us to be. Begum has asked to come home. She is right to ask this of the country where she was born, raised and radicalised.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Imagine this: a British teenage girl is groomed online at the age of 15. Stay with her nationality for a moment. She is British. She is indoctrinated by one of the world\u2019s most brutal terrorist cults and within 10 days of fleeing her home country is married to an extremist fighter. Stay with her age for a moment. She is 15. Four years later, two of her children have died and she has escaped across the desert, nine months pregnant, to a refugee camp. There, aged 19, she gives birth. And now she is asking to come home. Remove the inflammatory dog-whistle references to Isis brides and jihadi runaways and how much more likely is Shamima Begum to incite our pity and mercy? How much more likely are we to prioritise our duty of care to her as a British citizen? To treat the question of whether she poses a terrorist threat as one to be settled by the rule of law rather than trial by tabloid? But this is not how it\u2019s playing out. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, for starters, has vowed that he will not hesitate in preventing Begum\u2019s return. We could be discussing how to meet our responsibility to a vulnerable citizen. Instead we are deciding whether a traumatised teenager who claims not to be fazed at the sight of a severed head in a bin is sorry enough for our compassion to kick in. Or worse. One newspaper proudly announced Begum should \u201cexpect no sympathy from Britain\u201d. That same newspaper ran a column that read: \u201cSorry my heartless little jihadi bride, but you made your bed and now you can lie in it.\u201d Begum may have compared the Manchester Arena bombing to western airstrikes (she also said it was wrong that innocent people were killed), but is it really a surprise that a woman who fled to Syria at the age of 15, has spent the last four years living alongside extremists and may still be radicalised, is not saying the things we would like her to say? Meanwhile, others are spouting precisely the kind of poison we would expect, like Piers Morgan whose message to Begum is simply to \u201cgo f*ck herself\u201d. When the three schoolgirls fled to Syria in 2015 (Begum is the only known survivor), the reaction was to \u201cother\u201d them so absolutely that neither the girls nor their actions could have anything to do with Britain or its values. They were evil; they knew exactly what they were doing; they deserved what was coming to them. But listen to what Begum said when asked what attracted her to Isis in the first place. \u201cThe way they showed how you can go and they will take care of you,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou can have your own family.\u201d That Begum sought such seemingly benign and uncontroversial values is a damning indictment of this country. In every sense, we are responsible for her. This disturbing case holds a mirror up to Britain. In it we see a reflection of the racist, vengeful, and weak society we are, as opposed to the strong, stable, tolerant, humane, or even baseline-functioning one some, unbelievably, still claim us to be. Begum has asked to come home. She is right to ask this of the country where she was born, raised and radicalised.",

      "bodyText": "Russia\u2019s parliament has voted to ban its soldiers from using smartphones and social networks after a series of open-source investigations revealed their secret participation in foreign conflicts. Russia\u2019s Duma on Tuesday voted to ban members of the armed forces from publishing information online about their military units, deployments and other personal information, including photos, video and geolocation data. They will also be forbidden from carrying smartphones or other smart devices that can connect to the internet and can save data such as photos. Older mobile phones will not be banned. Russian officials said the ban was needed to protect secret military information from foreign intelligence services. The text of the legislation specifically noted attention to Russia\u2019s recent military campaign in Syria. Vladimir Bogodukhov, a member of the Duma\u2019s military committee, said: \u201cWe are defenceless, as long as our information is not protected from our so-called partners. \u201cThe goal of this legislation is not to complicate the lives of servicemen, but to secure their safety from exposure.\u201d Russians often post photographs and details about their military service on the social networks Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki as a way to stay in touch with fellow soldiers. But the data has also allowed open source investigators to follow the activities of Russian forces fighting secretly in Ukraine and in Syria, sometimes in real time. In particular, social media data has allowed journalists to track military units active in south-east Ukraine, where Russia said its forces were not present. One analysis by the investigative site Bellingcat tracked soldiers transporting a surface-to-air missile system believed to be tied to the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. In a video called Selfie Soldiers, Vice News managed to track down a Russian soldier from Buryatia in central Russia who had posted photos from east Ukraine during the conflict. Data from social networks has also made it easier to follow members of Russia\u2019s armed forces in Syria, in some cases several weeks before the country\u2019s involvement in the civil war was made public. Social media accounts have also been used in a number of cases to confirm casualties among members of Russian armed forces in east Ukraine and Syria. Journalists have also used photographs from social media to confirm several reports of hazing among military conscripts.",

He told the high court in Glasgow: \u201cI didn\u2019t even know her name until everything happened,\u201d and answered \u201cno\u201d and \u201cabsolutely not\u201d as his defence lawyer took him through the charges on Tuesday. Challenged under cross-examination that his story was a \u201ccomplete fabrication\u201d, the teenager insisted it was \u201c100% the truth\u201d. The advocate depute Iain McSporran, prosecuting, told the accused: \u201cSomebody brutalised Alesha McPhail,\u201d to which he replied: \u201cIt\u2019s not me. I would never do something like that.\u201d McSporran continued: \u201cYou murdered and raped her.

Alesha, from Airdrie in Lanarkshire, was found dead last July in the grounds of a disused hotel near her grandparents\u2019 seafront home, close to Rothesay, where she had arrived a few days earlier for a three-week summer break. She was last seen by her family at about 11pm on 1 July. Her grandmother Angela King reported her missing at 6.23am the next day and appealed for help on Facebook. A member of the public found Alesha\u2019s body approximately half a mile away at about 9am. The accused has named Toni McLachlan, the girlfriend of Alesha\u2019s father, Robert MacPhail, as the person responsible for the murder, claiming she took a used condom to plant evidence on the child\u2019s body. On Tuesday morning, a forensic scientist who had examined the dead girl told the court that DNA matching the 16-year-old was found all over Alesha\u2019s body and it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d this amount of evidence could be the result of transfer by a third party. Last week, the court heard the schoolgirl had sustained \u201ccatastrophic\u201d injuries to her genital area. Asked by Brian McConnachie, defending, if he knew how his DNA came to be on Alesha\u2019s body, the 16-year-old said: \u201cI think so \u2026 that Toni took that condom when I left and she went and killed her.\u201d The accused had earlier told the court he met McLachlan and had sex with her using a condom during the night Alesha disappeared. He then insisted he had lied to police about his whereabouts during that night in order to protect McLachlan because she had told him that her partner, Alesha\u2019s father, was abusive towards her. The accused offered the court alternative explanations for all the points of evidence put to him by the prosecution. Asked why he had sent a video of himself to friends in a Snapchat group with the message \u201cfound the guy who\u2019s done it\u201d the afternoon after Alesha\u2019s body was found, he said: \u201cPeople were talking about who might have done it and one of my friends said my name and I didn\u2019t want to take it to heart, so I just thought I would build on it.\u201d McConnachie suggested: \u201cYou were making people know you were responsible,\u201d but the teenager replied: \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t even know it was a murder at that time, we were just speculating.\u201d He also gave an explanation for why CCTV footage showed him leaving his family home three times during the night Alesha went missing.

      "bodyText": "Derek Hatton\u2019s readmittance to Labour after 34 years in the political wilderness has caused disquiet among centrist MPs and party activists in Liverpool. Hatton was expelled from the party for being a member of the Trotskyist grouping Militant. He was deputy leader of the Militant-controlled council which set an illegal budget in Liverpool in protest at local government spending cuts made by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government. On Monday it emerged that he has been told he can apply to become a member once again. Despite the intervening decades, Hatton \u2013 who was viewed as the effective leader of Militant in Liverpool despite only being deputy council leader - can still prompt strong reactions across the city. The timing has particular angered centrist Labour supporters because it coincided with the resignation of Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Berger over allegations of institutional antisemitism. One senior figure from Liverpool Riverside constituency, where some members are campaigning to unseat the sitting MP Louise Ellman, said members are bracing themselves for him to walk into a meeting. \u201cWe have been told he is joining our constituency, but we have not seen him as yet. His presence will result in more tensions, not less,\u201d the source said. Clare McIntyre, a Labour councillor in Luciana Berger\u2019s Wavertree constituency, criticised Hatton\u2019s readmission in what she described as a \u201ctoxic\u201d atmosphere of misogynistic bullying in the party. \u201cI am worried because he did do a lot of damage in Liverpool but also in terms of the way he speaks about women, I think is quite misogynist,\u201d she said. Hatton, 71, suggested in a column for the Liverpool Echo last year that women who \u201ccry rape\u201d should lose their right to anonymity if the accused is found not guilty. He has also written that if a defendant in a rape trial is acquitted \u201cthe blame should then be directed towards the accuser \u2013 usually a woman\u201d. He later said that \u201cafter numerous discussions with female friends\u201d he believed that blaming the accuser would simply deter rape victims from coming forward. McIntrye said: \u201cAt the moment it is quite toxic in the Labour party and not enough is being done to support and protect women who are getting abused and we saw that with Luciana. \u201cHis readmission just says to me that once again someone who can speak like that about women is welcome back in,\u201d she said. Several MPs tweeted their disapproval at the decision. Ian Murray, the MP for Edinburgh South, wrote: \u2018talk about a slap in the face\u201d shortly after the announcement. Tonia Antoniazzi MP\u200f wrote: \u201cShit day made even shittier\u201d. To many on the left of the party, Hatton, known as Degsy, remains a heroic figure for standing up to Margaret Thatcher and refusing to implement cuts to balance the council\u2019s budget. It was a radical move that fitted with Militant\u2019s slogan: \u201cBetter to break the law than break the poor\u201d. But for those on the right, he will be associated with confrontational hard-left tactics which resulted in a loss of trust with council workers and the public. He was denounced by the then Labour leader Neil Kinnock at the 1985 Labour conference in Bournemouth for using taxis to send redundancy notices to thousands of council workers. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what happens with impossible promises,\u201d Kinnock said. \u201cYou start with far-fetched resolutions.

Interviewed by the BBC on Tuesday, Hatton said it is \u201cgood to be back\u201d and insisted he had \u201cstayed absolutely solid for the Labour party\u201d for 34 years. Among his powerful supporters is Joe Anderson, the mayor of Liverpool who has known Hatton for over 40 years. Anderson said \u201cthings were different\u201d in the 80s and that many Liverpudlians backed Hatton\u2019s actions as they were \u201csick and tired of being kicked by the Tory government\u201d. But he added: \u201cOne of the things that he himself has recognised is those days are different to today\u2019s political world. I\u2019m a great believer that making mistakes doesn\u2019t make you a bad person \u2013 there were good things that happened in the 80s and bad things, but they were done with the right intentions. Sensible socialism, that\u2019s where I would class Hatton today.\u201d Hatton has been named as an outside candidate to run for Liverpool mayor when Anderson steps down after his second term next year. Asked whether Hatton was lining up a bid to replace him as mayor, Anderson laughed and said: \u201cI don\u2019t think Derek in his position has made any move or gesture towards standing.\u201d Peter Taaffe, the founding editor of Militant who was also expelled from Labour, said he hoped Hatton\u2019s membership will allow others to return. \u201cLet\u2019s hope that the admission of Derek Hatton back into the labour party, means the doors are thrown open to all others who have been expelled for no other reason than standing up for the working class,\u201d he said. Taaffe was told by the party\u2019s general secretary last year that he would not be able to join because he has been campaigning for Socialist Party candidates. More than 11,000 leftwing activists were suspended from the party in 2016 over concerns on entryism. Most of those have now been let back in to the party following internal investigations. Labour received no formal objections to Hatton\u2019s application when a party sub-committee considered his application several weeks ago.

      "bodyText": "An Italian parliamentary committee has voted to block a criminal case against Matteo Salvini, the deputy prime minister and interior minister, for refusing to allow migrants to disembark from a rescue ship. Prosecutors in Catania, Sicily, need the backing of parliament to continue investigations against Salvini, who also leads the far-right League party, for alleged abuse of office and kidnapping. Sixteen senators from the committee voted to defend Salvini\u2019s parliamentary immunity, while six were against. The Italian senate has until 24 March to decide whether or not to ratify the outcome of the vote. Salvini had sought immunity, arguing he acted in the interests of Italians when he stopped the 150 passengers, mostly from Eritrea, aboard an Italian coastguard ship from landing in Catania last August. Those onboard were stranded at sea for five days amid an EU standoff before the Catholic church, Ireland and Albania offered to take them in. Salvini\u2019s coalition partner, Luigi Di Maio, who fronts the Five Star Movement (M5S), supported his actions, arguing the decision was taken by the government as a whole. The result of the committee vote may ease tensions between the partners over other issues but has caused rifts within M5S as the party had garnered much of its support through a founding policy that called for the resignation of politicians under investigation. The party turned to its online platform, called Rousseau, on Monday to ask members to vote on the issue, a move that resulted in 59% supporting Salvini but which prompted criticism from some M5S politicians. Elena Fattori, an M5S senator, said the online vote was \u201cillegitimate\u201d and that she would vote to allow magistrates to continue the investigation. \u201cOur programme foresees the abolition of any kind of immunity for ministers and parliamentarians.

      "bodyText": "The converted warehouse in the inner west of Adelaide has none of the glitz and glamour you would expect of one of Australia\u2019s most successful circus companies. As Gravity and Other Myths (Gom, to the artists) rehearse their new production, industrial air-conditioning whirls to override summer outside. An inopportune metal pole is shielded by a pool noodle. An artist climbs a ladder to re-tape plastic sheeting against a window to keep the room dark. On the mats, eight acrobats experiment with new skills. Often, they fall. \u201cWhat do you call that one?\u201d yells director Darcy Grant. \u201cSketchy?\u201d comes the response. They try, and try again, until: \u201cBeautiful!\u201d This isn\u2019t a slick operation. It is fresh and scrappy. Out of Chaos will be the company\u2019s second work to premiere at the Adelaide festival. As it is in rehearsal the company is also in New York with A Simple Space. When that show premiered in 2013, it was performed in an abandoned cinema, lit by household lamps operated by the cast. Now, until 24 February, it\u2019s playing off Broadway.

Those with millions of dollars in superannuation have received hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of tax concessions over their lives. The most egregious was introduced by Peter Costello in 2007, when he made income from superannuation entirely tax-free.<strong> </strong>A wealthy Australian with a multimillion-dollar house and a million in superannuation can draw a pension of $100,000 per year and not pay a cent in tax. Someone working on the minimum wage of $37,398 per year pays more tax than a lot of our wealthiest superannuants.</p> <p>Which brings me back to dividend imputation credits. Not many people understand dividend imputation for the simple reason that they are not rich enough to care about it. But once people do get rich enough to care, you better believe they pay attention. So stick with me for a paragraph or two. I promise it will be worth it.</p> <p>Some of the wealthiest people in Australia pay negative tax. Whereas an Australian on a salary of $60,000 per year would pay income tax of $11,617, someone who inherited $1.2m worth of shares and received $60,000 per year in \u201cfully franked dividends\u201d would pay negative tax of $5,126 \u2013 they\u2019d get money from the government. Work for a living and your take-home pay is $48,383 out of $60,000 before tax, but earn a passive income from franked dividends and your take-home pay is $65,126 out of $60,000 before tax.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how it works. Companies pay tax on their profits before they pay dividends to their shareholders. When the dividends arrive in the shareholders\u2019 mail they come with \u201cfranking credits\u201d which tell the shareholder (and the tax office) how much tax has already been paid on the profits.</p> <p>We\u2019re nearly there.</p> <p>If the company paid 30% tax and the shareholder was in the 48% tax bracket then the shareholder would still need to pay an extra 18% tax on their dividends. But if the shareholder was in the 15% tax bracket then, because the company has already paid 30% tax, the shareholder is eligible for a refund of 15%. It\u2019s a complicated system that most countries don\u2019t bother with, but it makes some sense if you want to avoid \u201cdouble taxation\u201d ie companies and shareholders both paying tax on the same profits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b1bfefeddc33d376b87a35feba3eabcff0032f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b1bfefeddc33d376b87a35feba3eabcff0032f2/0_630_1491_894/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former Australian treasurer Peter Costello in Sydney 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Australian treasurer Peter Costello in Sydney 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Gray/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So far so good. But then Costello decided to punch a big, inequitable hole in our tax revenue bucket.</p> <p>In 2001 Costello changed the law to give people who had more \u201cdividend imputation credits\u201d than they had income tax obligations, a cash refund for \u201cspare dividend franking credits\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/13/labor-unveils-tax-write-offs-for-businesses-investing-in-australia\">Paul Keating backs Labor's plan to axe cash refunds for wealthy investors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stick with me now, because things are about to get weird.</p> <p>Usually to take advantage of a discount or a credit you have to buy the product. For example, while your local cafe might give you a \u201cfree coffee\u201d after you earn 10 \u201ccoffee credits\u201d on your loyalty card, try asking them to give you $5 instead.</p> <p>But luckily for some of Australia\u2019s wealthiest retirees, those rules don\u2019t apply to our tax system. If you have lots of income from shares and no other source of \u201ctaxable income\u201d, you pay negative tax \u2013 literally getting a refund for tax you never paid.</p> <p>It gets worse.</p> <p>In 2007, Costello declared that the money people aged over 60 pulled out of their (concessionally taxed) superannuation fund was not \u201ctaxable income\u201d. And when you combine that with dividend imputation, we hit peak weird \u2013 or peak rort, depending on your perspective.</p> <p>Imagine that you had $1.2m in superannuation and you were pulling out an annual income of $60,000 per year. Tax-free. Now imagine your aunt dies and leaves you her $1.2m in shares that pay fully franked dividends. You would now have two sources of income \u2013 tax-free super and negatively taxed dividends. In addition to your $120,000 per year you would also get a cheque from the ATO of $5,125. If your self-managed super fund has shares, you probably get another $5,000 to $25,000 worth of imputation credit refunds. And you get to call yourself \u201cself-funded\u201d!</p> <p>And that, my friends, is why people other than you spend so much money on lawyers, accountants and financial advice. It\u2019s also why Australia is one of the richest countries in the world but can no longer afford to ensure that pensioners in nursing homes get a decent feed.</p> <p>According to modelling by the Australia Institute, cash refunds for spare dividend imputation credits cost the federal budget more than $5bn last year and more than half of those cash refunds will go to people with more than $180,000.</p> <p>Both rorts are boring and technical, and the way they interact with each other is even more so. Which is why it has taken until 2019 for the fact that some of the wealthiest Australians pay negative tax and still call themselves self-funded retirees, to come under scrutiny. It\u2019s obscene.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Denniss is chief economist for the Australia Institute. His new book, Dead Right: How Neoliberalism ate itself and what comes next, is out now</p>",

The most egregious was introduced by Peter Costello in 2007, when he made income from superannuation entirely tax-free. A wealthy Australian with a multimillion-dollar house and a million in superannuation can draw a pension of $100,000 per year and not pay a cent in tax. Someone working on the minimum wage of $37,398 per year pays more tax than a lot of our wealthiest superannuants. Which brings me back to dividend imputation credits. Not many people understand dividend imputation for the simple reason that they are not rich enough to care about it. But once people do get rich enough to care, you better believe they pay attention. So stick with me for a paragraph or two. I promise it will be worth it. Some of the wealthiest people in Australia pay negative tax. Whereas an Australian on a salary of $60,000 per year would pay income tax of $11,617, someone who inherited $1.2m worth of shares and received $60,000 per year in \u201cfully franked dividends\u201d would pay negative tax of $5,126 \u2013 they\u2019d get money from the government. Work for a living and your take-home pay is $48,383 out of $60,000 before tax, but earn a passive income from franked dividends and your take-home pay is $65,126 out of $60,000 before tax. Here\u2019s how it works. Companies pay tax on their profits before they pay dividends to their shareholders. When the dividends arrive in the shareholders\u2019 mail they come with \u201cfranking credits\u201d which tell the shareholder (and the tax office) how much tax has already been paid on the profits. We\u2019re nearly there. If the company paid 30% tax and the shareholder was in the 48% tax bracket then the shareholder would still need to pay an extra 18% tax on their dividends. But if the shareholder was in the 15% tax bracket then, because the company has already paid 30% tax, the shareholder is eligible for a refund of 15%. It\u2019s a complicated system that most countries don\u2019t bother with, but it makes some sense if you want to avoid \u201cdouble taxation\u201d ie companies and shareholders both paying tax on the same profits. So far so good. But then Costello decided to punch a big, inequitable hole in our tax revenue bucket. In 2001 Costello changed the law to give people who had more \u201cdividend imputation credits\u201d than they had income tax obligations, a cash refund for \u201cspare dividend franking credits\u201d. Stick with me now, because things are about to get weird. Usually to take advantage of a discount or a credit you have to buy the product. For example, while your local cafe might give you a \u201cfree coffee\u201d after you earn 10 \u201ccoffee credits\u201d on your loyalty card, try asking them to give you $5 instead. But luckily for some of Australia\u2019s wealthiest retirees, those rules don\u2019t apply to our tax system. If you have lots of income from shares and no other source of \u201ctaxable income\u201d, you pay negative tax \u2013 literally getting a refund for tax you never paid. It gets worse. In 2007, Costello declared that the money people aged over 60 pulled out of their (concessionally taxed) superannuation fund was not \u201ctaxable income\u201d. And when you combine that with dividend imputation, we hit peak weird \u2013 or peak rort, depending on your perspective. Imagine that you had $1.2m in superannuation and you were pulling out an annual income of $60,000 per year. Tax-free. Now imagine your aunt dies and leaves you her $1.2m in shares that pay fully franked dividends. You would now have two sources of income \u2013 tax-free super and negatively taxed dividends. In addition to your $120,000 per year you would also get a cheque from the ATO of $5,125. If your self-managed super fund has shares, you probably get another $5,000 to $25,000 worth of imputation credit refunds. And you get to call yourself \u201cself-funded\u201d! And that, my friends, is why people other than you spend so much money on lawyers, accountants and financial advice. It\u2019s also why Australia is one of the richest countries in the world but can no longer afford to ensure that pensioners in nursing homes get a decent feed. According to modelling by the Australia Institute, cash refunds for spare dividend imputation credits cost the federal budget more than $5bn last year and more than half of those cash refunds will go to people with more than $180,000. Both rorts are boring and technical, and the way they interact with each other is even more so. Which is why it has taken until 2019 for the fact that some of the wealthiest Australians pay negative tax and still call themselves self-funded retirees, to come under scrutiny. It\u2019s obscene. \u2022 Richard Denniss is chief economist for the Australia Institute. His new book, Dead Right: How Neoliberalism ate itself and what comes next, is out now",

      "bodyText": "Welfare suspensions have increased 40% under the government\u2019s new compliance regime, as new data reveals participants on Australia\u2019s flagship jobs program had their payments temporarily cut off more than 1m times in six months. And while the new system, which sees the unemployed handed \u201cdemerit points\u201d for failing to meet their required activities, has also resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of \u201cfinancial penalties\u201d, the new figures show small numbers of Australia\u2019s most vulnerable job seekers are still being thrown off income support. After the new system was introduced in July 2018, Jobactive providers dished out 1.16m payment suspensions in the six months to December, government data provided to a Senate inquiry shows. By comparison, between July and December 2017, those on the Jobactive program had their payments temporarily cut off around 700,000 times. On average, people waited 4.1 business days until their payment was restored, but the suspensions lasted two weeks on 250,000 occasions, while 17,000 suspensions were not resolved for four weeks. The $7bn Jobactive program, which both the Coalition and Labor say they intend to reform, is the main scheme accessed by those on Newstart and Youth Allowance. A Senate inquiry report last week described Jobactive as \u201cpunitive\u201d and said people were getting jobs \u201cin spite\u201d of the program, which contracts private companies and not-for-profits to help the unemployed find work. In July last year, the government introduced a new welfare compliance system aimed at targeting those it claims repeatedly avoid their \u201cmutual obligation\u201d requirements. The scheme was opposed by welfare groups, who, while welcoming some aspects of the policy, remained concerned by some compliance aspects. Citing the new data, the government last week pointed to the fact welfare penalties under the new scheme had fallen about 95%. Unlike suspensions, \u201cpenalties\u201d see a jobseeker have their payment docked or cut completely for at least a month. But figures provided to the Senate show that, across all welfare programs, 260 people with a \u201chomelessness\u201d indicator on their Centrelink file were kicked off welfare payments for a month for non-compliance in the final half of 2018. There were also 96 single parents who lost their Centrelink payments for four weeks. In total, 1,134 homeless or at risk and 240 single-parent welfare recipients either lost their payments completely or had a fortnightly payment docked by half or in full. The data was provided to the inquiry in response to questions from the Greens senator Rachel Siewert. Last month Guardian Australian revealed in the first three months of the new regime nearly 20,000 homeless people had copped at least one \u201cdemerit point\u201d, which is usually accompanied by a payment suspension. Over six months, that figure is now nearly 30,000. Under the new compliance system, jobseekers have their payments suspended automatically if they fail to attend an appointment or meet another requirement. Their payments are restored with full backpay once they re-engage with their provider, but critics say suspensions are often imposed unreasonably or in error. The government argues these suspensions are used as a \u201cre-engagement tool\u201d to encourage jobseekers to attend their appointments and comply with their mutual obligation requirements. But welfare groups say the suspensions can have drastic consequences for those on low incomes, who risk missing rent payments or struggling to feed themselves when their money does not come through on time. The new compliance regime has also been controversially applied to the ParentsNext program, with data showing one in five participants had received a payment suspension. A Senate inquiry into that program will hear from participants in Melbourne next week.",

Financial firms would also be named and shamed in decisions by the Australian Financial Complaints Authority when it decides in favour of customers if Labor is elected. On Tuesday Labor released bills to implement five Hayne royal commission recommendations before the election but the opposition is yet to win the crossbench votes needed to recall parliament and also faces a substantial pushback from mortgage brokers about its support for banning trailing commissions. Under the Labor plan, the big four banks, Australian Banking Association and financial regulators, Apra and Asic, will be required to develop royal commission implementation plans by 1 August. Stakeholders will have to report on their progress to Labor\u2019s proposed royal commission implementation taskforce in the treasury department every six months. The chief executives of the big four banks and the ABA will also have to report to the House of Representatives economics committee and attend public hearings every six months. Bill Shorten said: \u201cOnly Labor can be trusted to clean up the banks \u2013 we\u2019ve got draft legislation on the table to protect Australians and we\u2019ll make banking execs front up to parliament and explain what they are doing to clean up their act.\u201d Shorten warned the royal commission report \u201ccan\u2019t be left to gather dust on a bookshelf\u201d. \u201cLabor fought for this banking royal commission and we will continue the fight to make sure consumers are protected and the banks aren\u2019t let off the hook.\u201d On Tuesday the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, responded to Labor\u2019s bills by noting they implemented five recommendations, \u201ca mere 6%\u201d of commissioner Kenneth Hayne\u2019s proposals. Scott Morrison said the Coalition would not \u201cengage in reckless legislation\u201d but is responding to all 76 royal commission recommendations \u201cin a measured way, consulting to ensure there are no unintended consequences\u201d. Shorten said Morrison and the Coalition voted against the royal commission 26 times and \u201che continues to not clean up the banks by continuing with his part-time parliament\u201d. Labor is yet to announce how it will implement the Hayne recommendation to ban trailing commissions for mortgage brokers. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, who initially indicated Labor would accept the recommendation \u2013 unlike the government, which expressed reluctance about implementing a user-pays system \u2013 hedged on Tuesday when asked what Labor would do with the politically influential sector. Bowen said Labor was \u201ctaking our time to carefully consult with all relevant parties and we\u2019ll have more to say in coming days about our proposed approach\u201d. \u201cWe will be fully transparent and explicit in our approach, not only well before the election, but in the immediate future\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>jBack in October, at the close of his Chanel spring/summer 2019 show, Karl Lagerfeld appeared for his traditional post-show bow, hand-in-hand with a tall brunette. Nowhere near as recognisable as the world-famous man standing beside her, nor even a frequently used name in fashion circles, the woman \u2013 dressed in an outfit of understated jeans and a denim jacket, with a Brigitte Bardot fringe \u2013 applauded adoringly as Lagerfeld took what would be his final applause from a rapturous audience.</p> <p>To those in the know, Lagerfeld\u2019s companion was the seldom seen Virginie Viard, his most trusted aide and protege \u2013 or, as Chanel put it, \u201chis closest collaborator\u201d. While her name may not ring the same bells as Lagerfeld or the house\u2019s founder, Coco Chanel, those on the inside will attest that she has been integral to the house\u2019s continued success. Lagerfeld once described their relationship as \u201cessential, doubled by a very real friendship and affection\u201d and said it was he, Viard and two others who ran the fashion chain.</p> <p>Three months later, in January, at his final couture show, it would be Viard alone who took the bow, marking the first time in Lagerfeld\u2019s three-decade history at the house that he failed to appear. While Chanel sought to avoid spreading alarm by saying that the designer was \u201cfeeling tired\u201d, it confirmed that it was Lagerfeld\u2019s request that Viard \u201crepresent him and greet the guests\u201d. Now, after the news that she has been \u201centrusted by [Chanel\u2019s co-owner] Alain Wertheimer with the creative work for the collections, so that the legacy of Gabrielle Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld can live on\u201d, she will find herself in the spotlight left vacant by her mentor. The move to appoint behind-the-scenes talent to a top job is one that mirrors other influential fashion houses, such as the appointment of Alessandro Michele at Gucci, Daniel Lee at Bottega Veneta and Natacha Ramsay-Levi at Chlo\u00e9. But in many ways for Viard, all roads have led to this place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"014599fbb6f194b27297c14f0e65b49e1f5c69a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/014599fbb6f194b27297c14f0e65b49e1f5c69a6/0_201_3856_2314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Viard with Lagerfeld last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Viard with Lagerfeld last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coming from a family of silk manufacturers, Viard had a natural trajectory into fashion. When she was young, she was inspired by French New Wave cinema and idols such as Anna Karina and Gena Rowlands, and, after studying textiles, she embarked on a career in costume design for theatre and film. The story goes that it was after an introduction to Lagerfeld by Prince Rainier of Monaco\u2019s chamberlain (a mutual friend) in 1987 that she was invited to work on embroidery at Chanel, marking the start of a 32-year-long relationship. Lagerfeld kept Viard at his side during his creative director stint at the French fashion house Chlo\u00e9 between 1992 and 1997. He then brought her back to Chanel, where she became the coordinator of haute couture and, in 2000, the ready-to-wear collections.</p> <p>As the brand\u2019s creative studio director, it has been Viard who brings Lagerfeld\u2019s sketches to fruition, liaising with the seamstresses in the ateliers across the collections. \u201cI visualise the show, get things ready for him, decide on materials, coordinate the teams and liaise with suppliers,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/fashion/trend-reports/a25350882/elle-editorial-karls-crew-december-2018/\" title=\"\">she said in 2017</a>. She also once said: \u201cI love to please him, but also surprise him,\u201d and described him as \u201cvery sensitive, like all creative people, but very faithful, generous \u2013 which might not be what people would guess\u201d.</p> <p>While she has long been thought to be the natural successor to Lagerfeld, Viard has previously said that she hates the spotlight. Instead, she has described herself as \u201cfairly curious\u201d and someone who likes to \u201ckeep an eye on fashion, but it\u2019s not what inspires me\u201d. She has cited reading, music, art, the theatre and spending time with her partner and teenage son as her favourite things to do \u2013 a quiet and peaceful world away from the razzmatazz that comes with a Chanel fashion show.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/feb/19/karl-lagerfeld-obituary\">Karl Lagerfeld obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even when it comes to her methods of working, she has been reluctant to be seen centre stage. \u201cEverything goes along smoothly because, above all, our studio is about teamwork,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.crash.fr/virginie-viard-interview-on-chanel/\" title=\"\">she told the French magazine Crash</a>. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m a \u2018director\u2019. Our hierarchy isn\u2019t felt throughout the studio, it\u2019s seamless. In the end, it\u2019s Karl who looks at the outfits with the workshop leaders; I don\u2019t even need to be there. It\u2019s always he who has the last word.\u201d</p> <p>There is no indication of how long Viard will be steering the ship for. Persistent rumours have linked Phoebe Philo with Chanel ever since she left Celine in 2017. But the swift succession announcement suggests that Chanel may follow the model of Alexander McQueen, where McQueen\u2019s closest colleague, Sarah Burton, took the creative reins when he died in 2010 and has kept his legacy alive in her own inimitable way. Viard\u2019s task will be to put her stamp on the revered fashion house while honouring the legacy of Coco Chanel and Lagerfeld. As she said two years ago: \u201cI like to think of myself as the one who helps his vision come alive.\u201d</p>",

Nowhere near as recognisable as the world-famous man standing beside her, nor even a frequently used name in fashion circles, the woman \u2013 dressed in an outfit of understated jeans and a denim jacket, with a Brigitte Bardot fringe \u2013 applauded adoringly as Lagerfeld took what would be his final applause from a rapturous audience. To those in the know, Lagerfeld\u2019s companion was the seldom seen Virginie Viard, his most trusted aide and protege \u2013 or, as Chanel put it, \u201chis closest collaborator\u201d. While her name may not ring the same bells as Lagerfeld or the house\u2019s founder, Coco Chanel, those on the inside will attest that she has been integral to the house\u2019s continued success. Lagerfeld once described their relationship as \u201cessential, doubled by a very real friendship and affection\u201d and said it was he, Viard and two others who ran the fashion chain. Three months later, in January, at his final couture show, it would be Viard alone who took the bow, marking the first time in Lagerfeld\u2019s three-decade history at the house that he failed to appear. While Chanel sought to avoid spreading alarm by saying that the designer was \u201cfeeling tired\u201d, it confirmed that it was Lagerfeld\u2019s request that Viard \u201crepresent him and greet the guests\u201d. Now, after the news that she has been \u201centrusted by [Chanel\u2019s co-owner] Alain Wertheimer with the creative work for the collections, so that the legacy of Gabrielle Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld can live on\u201d, she will find herself in the spotlight left vacant by her mentor. The move to appoint behind-the-scenes talent to a top job is one that mirrors other influential fashion houses, such as the appointment of Alessandro Michele at Gucci, Daniel Lee at Bottega Veneta and Natacha Ramsay-Levi at Chlo\u00e9. But in many ways for Viard, all roads have led to this place. Coming from a family of silk manufacturers, Viard had a natural trajectory into fashion. When she was young, she was inspired by French New Wave cinema and idols such as Anna Karina and Gena Rowlands, and, after studying textiles, she embarked on a career in costume design for theatre and film. The story goes that it was after an introduction to Lagerfeld by Prince Rainier of Monaco\u2019s chamberlain (a mutual friend) in 1987 that she was invited to work on embroidery at Chanel, marking the start of a 32-year-long relationship. Lagerfeld kept Viard at his side during his creative director stint at the French fashion house Chlo\u00e9 between 1992 and 1997. He then brought her back to Chanel, where she became the coordinator of haute couture and, in 2000, the ready-to-wear collections. As the brand\u2019s creative studio director, it has been Viard who brings Lagerfeld\u2019s sketches to fruition, liaising with the seamstresses in the ateliers across the collections. \u201cI visualise the show, get things ready for him, decide on materials, coordinate the teams and liaise with suppliers,\u201d she said in 2017. She also once said: \u201cI love to please him, but also surprise him,\u201d and described him as \u201cvery sensitive, like all creative people, but very faithful, generous \u2013 which might not be what people would guess\u201d. While she has long been thought to be the natural successor to Lagerfeld, Viard has previously said that she hates the spotlight. Instead, she has described herself as \u201cfairly curious\u201d and someone who likes to \u201ckeep an eye on fashion, but it\u2019s not what inspires me\u201d. She has cited reading, music, art, the theatre and spending time with her partner and teenage son as her favourite things to do \u2013 a quiet and peaceful world away from the razzmatazz that comes with a Chanel fashion show. Even when it comes to her methods of working, she has been reluctant to be seen centre stage. \u201cEverything goes along smoothly because, above all, our studio is about teamwork,\u201d she told the French magazine Crash. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m a \u2018director\u2019. Our hierarchy isn\u2019t felt throughout the studio, it\u2019s seamless. In the end, it\u2019s Karl who looks at the outfits with the workshop leaders; I don\u2019t even need to be there. It\u2019s always he who has the last word.\u201d There is no indication of how long Viard will be steering the ship for. Persistent rumours have linked Phoebe Philo with Chanel ever since she left Celine in 2017. But the swift succession announcement suggests that Chanel may follow the model of Alexander McQueen, where McQueen\u2019s closest colleague, Sarah Burton, took the creative reins when he died in 2010 and has kept his legacy alive in her own inimitable way. Viard\u2019s task will be to put her stamp on the revered fashion house while honouring the legacy of Coco Chanel and Lagerfeld. As she said two years ago: \u201cI like to think of myself as the one who helps his vision come alive.\u201d",

It could be a new party. it could be a movement,\u201d he said later in the interview.</p> <p>Umunna said that he and the others who had departed from Labour had faced a moral dilemma where they could not longer support the Labour leader and work to put him in power.</p> <p>The MP rejected suggestions that the new group was, \u201cat best,\u201d a distraction from the broader campaign against Brexit, which he has been a key part of through the moves to press for a second referendum.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that we had exhausted any capacity to do that [within Labour],\u201d he said.</p> <p>In a reference to some of the rows over national security policy that have engulfed Labour in recent years, Umunna also said that he and his colleagues had had a particular issue with the narratives of states hostile to the UK finding favour with some in Labour.</p> <p>Earlier, Umunna told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain: \u201cWe are not the SDP. This is a different century.\u201d </p> <p>Asked when the group of MPs could evolve into a new centre party with a name and more members, he said: \u201cI would like to see us move as quickly as possible and certainly by the end of the year, but that\u2019s my personal view.\u201d </p> <p>He added: \u201cThere needs to be an alternative, so that\u2019s perfectly possible. But I don\u2019t get to determine this.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-19T10:16:50.163Z\">at 10.16am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c6bbb1ae4b051cdac4efaf7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-19T08:18:12.741Z\">8.18am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Honda confirms shut down in Swindon</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Honda has confirmed plans to shut its factory in Swindon in 2021 with the loss of 3,500 jobs. </p> <p>The decision is not Brexit related, the BBC\u2019s Today Programme has been told by Ian Howells of Honda.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in a position where out investment and focus needs to go somewhere else, it can\u2019 be in the UK,\u201d he said, blaming the move on the \u2018global outlook\u2019.</p> <p>In a statement, the Japanese firm told workers it proposed to close the vehicle manufacturing plant at the end of the current model\u2019s production lifecycle. <br>The plant currently produces 150,000 cars a year. </p> <p>The statement said: \u201cThis proposal comes as Honda accelerates its commitment to electrified cars, in response to the unprecedented changes in the global automotive industry. </p> <p>\u201cThe significant challenges of electrification will see Honda revise its global manufacturing operations, and focus activity in regions where it expects to have high production volumes.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/feb/19/honda-expected-to-confirm-factory-closure-business-live\">Honda confirms Swindon factory closure \u2013 business live</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-19T08:45:30.719Z\">at 8.45am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c6bb9dbe4b079bb67ae2d92\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-19T08:14:51.740Z\">8.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Someone who has been going in the opposite direction to the seven Labour MPs who quit the party yesterday is <strong>Derek Hatton</strong>, the former deputy leader of Liverpool City Council.</p> <p>Speaking after it was reported he had formally been readmitted to the Labour Party 34 years after being expelled, the former key figure in the Militant Tendency told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: </p> <p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s good to be back, in fact in a way I\u2019ve never left. </p> <p>\u201cFor 34 years I\u2019ve stayed absolutely solid with the Labour Party.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now. Thanks for reading and commenting \u2013 here\u2019s a summary of the afternoon\u2019s events: Labour\u2019s leader Jeremy Corbyn issued a strong message to the seven MPs who resigned from his party. He reminded the group that they \u201cwere elected to carry out those policies\u201d. The Labour leader was speaking at the annual conference of the manufacturers\u2019 group Make UK. It was his first public appearance since the breakaway MPs announced their departure. Earlier Corbyn said that his party has developed policies that are radical but they are also popular and the party is doing it best to put them forward. His comments came in response to a question about what Labour is doing, or going to do, to retain MPs and stop others from leaving. The business secretary, Greg Clark, said that uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future in the European Union must end due to the negative impact it was having, after Honda said it would close its car plant in Britain. \u201cThis news comes on top of months of uncertainty that you as manufacturers have had to endure about Brexit, about our future relationship with the EU,\u201d said Clark. A report has found that Brexit is already leading to a \u201cpalpable decline\u201d in British influence at the UN, and that influence would be in freefall but for the UK\u2019s commitment to spend 0.7 % of gross national income on overseas aid. Labour MP Chuka Umunna has said he hopes to form a new party by the end of the year. It follows his resignation, along with six other MPs, who left the party due to disagreements over the party\u2019s stance on Brexit and issues of antisemitism. That\u2019s all from us this evening. Jeremy Corbyn has accused Theresa May of trying to \u201cblackmail\u201d MPs into backing her Brexit deal by running down the clock to prevent alternative plans being considered. The Labour leader accused the prime minister of risking a no-deal Brexit in order to keep the Conservative party together. The Labour leader, who has suffered a split in his own party on Monday, partly due to Brexit policy, called on the prime minister to accept his offer of working on a \u201csensible\u201d deal. Addressing manufacturers\u2019 organisation Make UK, formerly known as EEF, he said Labour\u2019s plan \u2013 based on a customs union \u2013 \u201ccould win the support of parliament, be negotiated with the European Union and help bring the country together\u201d. Corbyn, who is due to hold talks with EU negotiator Michel Barnier on Thursday, said the Labour plan \u201chas been widely welcomed as a way of breaking the impasse\u201d. He said: \u201cIf the prime minister is unable to adopt a sensible deal because it would split the Tories, then there needs to be a general election. Without it we will keep all options on the table, including the option of a public vote. The country cannot be taken over the cliff edge for the sake of Tory party unity.\u201d \u201cThe government is running down the clock in an attempt to blackmail MPs with the threat of crashing out without a deal.\u201d An estimated 100,000 Scots could lose their job in the event of a no-deal Brexit, MSPs have been told. If the UK is forced to quit the European Union on March 29 with no agreement in place \u201cthings will change, and change very fast for the worse\u201d, Scottish constitutional relations secretary Mike Russell warned. In a statement at Holyrood, Russell said: \u201cA no-deal Brexit could, we estimate, result in an increase in unemployment in Scotland of around 100,000 people, more than doubling the unemployment rate. We would go from a record low to a level not far off that at the depths of the last recession, with all the human costs which that would entail.\u201d He added: \u201cWhatever we as a government do, and we will do everything we can, we simply could not avoid that sort of damage being done to our economy and our country. But one person could - the Prime Minister could.\u201d Scottish finance secretary Derek Mackay will publish a new paper on the economic cost of a no-deal Brexit later this week. Tobias Ellwood MP, defence minister, has said the hard-Brexit European Research Group were \u201ccoming to the point where they are tarnishing the brand of the [Conservative] party.\u201d Speaking on Sky News, he added that he wants to remain in a \u201ccompassionate and outward looking party\u201d that is \u201cinclusive\u201d and \u201cattractive to the next generation\u201d. \u201cThat is not possible with the European Research Group working as a block.. not as individuals but as a block ... We must not allow that branding to poison moderate perspective centre right Conservative party.\u201d Labour\u2019s leader Jeremy Corbyn has issued a defiant message to the seven MPs who resigned from his party, reminding them they were elected to carry out the party\u2019s manifesto. He said the group \u2013 who broke away from the party on Monday \u2013 \u201cwere elected to carry out those policies\u201d. The Labour leader was speaking at the annual conference of the manufacturers\u2019 group Make UK. It was his first public appearance since the breakaway MPs announced their departure. A protester has been charged with harassment after MP Anna Soubry was taunted outside Parliament. James Goddard, 29, was accused of two counts of harassment relating to incidents on December 19 and January 7. The Crown Prosecution Service said he is also accused of two public order offences against a police officer. The self-styled \u201cyellow vest\u201d activist posted a video on Facebook on Tuesday to thank his supporters after being warned he was likely to be remanded in custody when he answered police bail. \u201cIf they do remand me then we will just have to learn from it, go away, do it, come back even stronger,\u201d he said. Goddard was arrested by the Metropolitan Police on January 12 following claims that Soubry was harassed in Westminster five days earlier. Corbyn is asked by Sky News what the party is doing, or going to do, to retain MPs and stop others from leaving. He replies that Labour has developed policies that are radical but they are also popular and the party is doing it best to put them forward. \u201cThey are are discussed frequently with parliamentary colleagues and we are making huge progress,\u201d he said. By contrast to remarks by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, earlier today about how the party needs to embark on a \u201cmassive\u201d listening exercise, Corbyn added that anyone who says they \u201care not being consulted are not taking up the opportunities that are are open and available to them at all times.\u201d There is also a question from Heather Stewart of the Guardian who asked if he agrees with his deputy, Tom Watson, that Labour\u2019s front bench needs to diversify to encompass more views. Corbyn began by saying that he was proud to lead the Labour party and proud of what it achieved in so many areas of society. \u201cI recognise that leading the party, you have to take people with you,\u201d he said, adding that he was determined to do that so that the party\u2019s policies can be best represented when an election comes. Corbyn is now taking questions. The first one is about the departure of the seven MPs and cites their claims that the party is anti-semitic, that he is anti-business and that others are planning to follow Chuka Umunna and co out of the party. The Labour leader is also asked about when he is going to invoke a call for a second referendum on Brexit. Corbyn replies that he regrets the MPs left, \u201cbecause I want our party to be strong, to be united around the polices that we have put forward. On the question of a second referendum, he cites the Labour frontbench\u2019s recent amendment in parliament which called for a \u201cpopular vote\u201d at the end of the process. He accuses the government of \u201crunning down the clock\u201d on Brexit, which he says would be very damaging to the economy. Jeremy Corbyn has been announcing proposals for a major investment in skills and education. The Labour leader outlined plans for a national education service which would be available to everyone, \u201cwhatever their age, from cradle to grave.\u201d Speaking at the EEF employers\u2019 group manufacturing conference, Corbyn referred early in his speech to the departure of seven MPs yesterday, saying that he was disappointed that they had failed to get behind a Labour agenda which was in line with the wishes of half a million Labour Party members both inside and outside of parliament and with millions of people around the country. Quoting Tony Benn\u2019s comments about how education should be like an escalator, Corbyn also announced details of a Commission for Lifelng Learning, which will be jointly chaired by the former Education Sectretary, Estelle Morris, and trade unionist Dave Ward. \u201cNever again will workers feel discarded,\u201d said Corbyn, who added that it made no sense for people to be only educated for the first quarter of their lives. \u201cWe have to end the outdated grammar school mentality of looking down on someone who does a vocational course and looking up to someone who does an academic course.\u201d A circumspect interview by the Japanese ambassador to the UK, Koji Tsuruoka, has yielded a few lines on the BBC\u2019s World at One. Perhaps it was what he didn\u2019t say that was most interesting though when he was asked about a report this week in the Financial Times that Japanese officials had accused Jeremy Hunt and Liam Fox of taking a \u201chigh-handed\u201d approach towards a post-Brexit free trade deal, and briefly considered cancelling bilateral talks due to take place this week. The FT cited unnamed officials in Tokyo who reacted with dismay to a letter sent on 8 February in which Hunt, the foreign secretary, and Fox, the international trade secretary, insisted that \u201ctime is of the essence\u201d in securing a trade deal with Japan, the world\u2019s third-biggest economy. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was any kind of emotional offensiveness in the terms of the letter,\u201d he said, while stopping short of saying that the report was untrue. Pressed on whether he was telling his government that British politics was \u201cstable,\u201d he said: \u201cPredictability is a very important element. That is why uncertainty has caused a lot second thoughts about continuing business in the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have told both the EU and the UK government that Brexit should not damage the stable economic environment that we all enjoy today.\u201d The lack of predicability.. the lack of what may happen next is a real problem,\u201d said the ambassador who repeated his prime minister\u2019s support for the deal negotiated with Brussels by Theresa May. \u201cHe also said very clearly that no deal should also be avoided.\u201d Uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union must be ended so that businesses can have clarity about the future, business minister Greg Clark has said. Speaking hours after Honda said it would close its car plant in Britain, Clark told the EEF employers\u2019 group manufacturing conference: \u201cDecisions like Honda\u2019s this morning demonstrate starkly how much is at stake.\u201d \u201cThis news comes on top of months of uncertainty that you as manufacturers have had to endure about Brexit, about our future relationship with the EU,\u201d said Clark. \u201cA situation in which our manufacturers do not have the certainty they need about the terms under which two thirds of our trade will be conducted in 40 days time is unacceptable - it needs to be brought to conclusion and without further delay.\u201d He added: \u201cWe will go on making sure that the argument that manufacturers put for a deal to be concluded swiftly is something that is heard loud and clear,\u201d he said. The number of EU workers in the UK fell by 61,000 at a time when the employment rate for British and non-EU workers has soared, according to new official figures which have been seized on by figures from opposing sides of the Brexit divide. There was an estimated 2.33 million workers from the European Union between October to December in 2017, but that figure dropped to 2.27 million a year later. A notable drop in workers from eight eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 had largely accounted for the decrease. This contrasted with an increase in the number of non-EU workers in the UK, jumping from 1.16 million to 1.29 million in the same time period. This was an increase of 130,000 compared with the equivalent period 12 months earlier, and the highest number the highest number since records started in 1997. Rosie Duffield, Labour MP and a leading supporter of People\u2019s Vote, said: \u201cThe uncertainty over Brexit means it is sadly no surprise that tens of thousands of EU nationals have left Britain over the past year, and that fewer people want to come here to contribute to our society and our economy. Brexit is already damaging our NHS, our universities and industry and means less money for public services. Overall, The number of people in work in the UK reached a record 32.6 million. Emma Barr, Head of Communications at the right-leaning Centre for Policy Studies said: \u201cThese figures are extremely reassuring. Even as we prepare to leave the EU, the British economy - and British business - is still creating jobs at an enviable rate, with record levels of people in work thanks to our flexible labour market.\u201d The health secretary Matt Hancock has been urged to stop private companies from securing NHS contracts, after Labour research found Dozens of new NHS contracts worth \u00a3128m are currently out to tender. Research commissioned by the Labour Party found a total of 26 health service contracts worth more than \u00a3128m are currently out to tender, including one worth more than \u00a390 million, reports Aisha Zahid for the Guardian. Last month in front of the Health and Social Care Select Committee, Matt Hancock MP stated there would be: \u201cno privatisation of the NHS on my watch.\u201d But Labour is demanding that the health secretary delivers on this statement by ensuring these new NHS contracts are kept in public hands. The House of Commons Library for Labour identified that the 26 contracts include a new \u00a391m contract for a NHS 111/Clinical Assessment Service in the South East. Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Health and Social Care Secretary, said: \u201cThis health secretary\u2019s privatisation credentials become clearer by the day - whether it\u2019s promoting GP at Hand to endorsing private dentistry to now allowing millions of pounds worth of health services contracts to be privatised. A warning has been sounded that condition are potentially now favourable for a more formalised Far Right movement to emerge from what is, for now, \u201ca shapeless and leaderless mass of angry people\u201d Joe Mulhall, a senior researcher at anti-racism organisation, Hope not Hate, suggests that the anti-Muslim activist Robinson (real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon) could yet take on the leadership of such a movement or even do so within Ukip, which has embraced the far right under Gerard Batten. With trust in politicians and our political system at a low point, there is a ready pool of people who could be attracted to this type of messaging. Whatever happens with Brexit there is bound to be a narrative of betrayal being advanced by the far right that will likely speak to large numbers of people in the UK and reinforce existing disillusionment. Regardless, we cannot wait for a traditional, united, far-right umbrella organisation to emerge before we act. We need to start connecting the dots now and to realise that what we\u2019ve seen over the last year is various incarnations of the same threat. Chris Leslie of the Independent Group has made a first intervention for the new political entity during House of Commons health and social care questions, shoehorning in one of the catchphrases from yesterday\u2019s press conference. Delays around plans for the long-term funding of adult social care \u201ctypify the broken politics in this country,\u201d said Leslie, who was flanked on either side by colleagues Mike Gapes and Angela Smith. Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock sought to make hay out of Labour\u2019s split (splintering?), telling fellow MPs that his Labour shadow, John Ashworth was a \u201creasonable and sensible man. \u201cI like him. My politics are probably closer to him than his are to the leader of his party,\u201d said Hancock, to laughter. Gesturing to the former Labour MPs, he then added: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he have the gumption to join his friends over there in the Independent Group rather than backing this hard left proto communist?\u201d MPs have been pressing Health Secretary Matt Hancock on whether adequate supplies of insulin will be available in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Speaking during questions in the Commons, Hancock said \u201cI am confident that if everybody does what they need to do then the supply of medicines will continue unhindered.\u201d Vicky Ford, a Conservative, was among a number of MPs who said that constituents had contacted her about supplies of insulin in particular. Hancock told her that the two major suppliers had prepared stockpiles of double the six weeks which the government had called for when it came to drugs storage for Brexit eventualities. The government has pledged to look into cases of missed targets after it was revealed that there had been a dramatic rise in hospital admissions for potentially life-threatening eating disorders in the last year. Health Minister Jackie Doyle Smith was responding to Labour\u2019s Paul Sheriff during questions in the House of Commons, where the latter referred to a Guardian report this week on a growing crisis of young people experiencing anorexia and bulimia. Sheriff asked that, if prevention was better than cure, why were so many children with eating disorders going to Accident and Emergency departments? Figures seen by the Guardian show year-on-year rises in hospital visits, with admission numbers more than doubling from 7,260 in 2010-11 to 16,023 in the year to April 2018. The latest figure is up from 13,885 the year before \u2013 the highest spike in eight years. Experts said the surge in numbers was down to the failure of NHS services to tackle anorexia and bulimia at an earlier stage, before people become so unwell that they need to be admitted to hospital. The Irish writer, Fintan O\u2019Toole, has penned another of his semi-psychoanalytic takes on Brexit. Writing in the Irish Times, he argues this time that unfolding events indicate that the \u201charmless eccentrics\u201d which the English have long warmed to have mutated into the \u201charmful kind\u201d. When all of this is done \u2013 if indeed it ever is done \u2013 a question will puzzle historians. How did absurd characters like Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg, and all those lesser swivel-eyes loons you think must have just have wandered into shot but who turn out to be long-serving Tory MPs, come to exert such influence on the fate of nations? They will have to grapple with a strange phenomenon \u2013 the way the English love of eccentricity turned sour. Michael Gove told the National Farmers\u2019 Union\u2019s annual conference in Birmingham that reports that Britain would operate a zero tariff regime was \u201cnot accurate\u201d. \u201cIt will not be the case that we will have zero rate tariffs on food products, there will be protection for agriculture and food,\u201d Gove said. He warned that British farmers could be locked out of the EU from 30th March in the event of no deal. The NFU has already warned that health and safety audits required on individual food processing plans required by the EU could take six months to complete, effectively locking British farming exporters out of the bloc. Gove today confirmed this pointing out the EU had, with six weeks not classified the UK as a \u201cthird country\u201d which will only happen after these audits are complete. \u201cThe EU still have not listed the UK as a full third country\u2026as I speak there is no absolute guarantee we will continue to be able to export to the EU,\u201d he told farmers. He also said that the dangers of no deal would not be removed if, in future, a trade deal was sealed between the UK and the EU. Once tariffs are imposed by the EU on British exports \u201cit will be difficult to reestablish that market access even if tariffs reduced in the future.\u201d He also admitted that there in the event of no deal there will be delays in Calais as fresh food exports and animals will all be subject to mandatory checks. A bit of a bombshell has been dropped by Michael Gove in his speech to farmers. Ahead of the speech, there have also been warnings that high tariffs on beef and lamb imposed after the UK\u2019s departure could wipe out some farmers who rely on exports to the EU. The government is to announce its proposals for tariffs in a no-deal scenario this month. Brexit is already leading to a \u201cpalpable decline\u201d in British influence at the UN, and that influence would be in freefall but for the UK\u2019s commitment to spend 0.7 % of gross national income on overseas aid, a study has found. The report by the UK branch of the United Nations Association suggests Britain will lose political capital on the 15-member UN security council and the larger general assembly in New York because its campaigns will no longer be automatically aligned with those of the EU. Based on more than 40 interviews, on and off the record, with current and previous UN-based diplomats, the report suggests the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, will need to work harder to highlight a more value-based diplomacy, and a commitment to multilateralism, to retain the UK\u2019s traction. It says few overseas diplomats regard the phrase \u201cGlobal Britain\u201d as anything other than a slogan for domestic consumption. (Full story) The Guardian\u2019s Lisa O\u2019Carroll has been tweeting from the National Farmers\u2019 Union annual conference, which is being addressed by the environment secretary, Michael Gove. He called on farmer to put pressure on their MPs to vote for the deal which Theresa May has negotiated with Brussels. Also, there was this insight into how Gove kicks back when he clocks out of the office: Chuka Umunna has said he hopes a new party will be created by the end of the year, after he and six other MPs quit Labour citing anger at the party\u2019s Brexit policy and the issue of antisemitism. Umunna hinted that he expected more MPs, including some from the Conservative party, to depart in the coming days and weeks. \u201cI would like to see us move as quickly as possible and certainly by the end of the year, but that\u2019s my personal view,\u201d he told ITV. \u201cThere needs to be an alternative, so that\u2019s perfectly possible. But I don\u2019t get to determine this.\u201d Umunna \u2013 who quit the party alongside Luciana Berger, Mike Gapes, Chris Leslie, Angela Smith, Gavin Shuker and Ann Coffey \u2013 said moderate Conservatives had \u201cbecome demoralised by the Ukip-isation of their party and their position on Europe\u201d. At least two Tory MPs are believed to be seriously considering their position in the party and more could follow them, with names including Sarah Wollaston, Heidi Allen and Nick Boles. Other Labour MPs on Monday night suggested their response would be governed by the reaction of the party leadership. \u201cFrank Field left Labourover bullying six months ago,\u201d MP Neil Coyle said. A man who worked at the Honda plant in Swindon for more than two decades has directly linked its impending closure to Brexit, describing the government\u2019s handling of the UK\u2019s imminent departure from the EU as \u201cidiocy of epic proportions.\u201d There\u2019s a clip of him which which is rapidly going viral.. Somehow I suspect we\u2019re going to be hearing more from him in the next 48 hours. West Streeting, Labour Ilford North in Essex, has given this reaction to those comments from earlier by John McDonnell about the need for Labour to engage in a \u201cmassive listening exercise.\u201d The environment secretary, Michael Gove, has just started to speak at the National Farmers\u2019 Union annual conference, where he is expected to pledge that British food standards will not be lowered \u201cin pursuit of trade deals\u201d. Gove\u2019s office also guided ahead of the speech that he will vow to minimise the risk that food producers will be left at \u201ccompetitive disadvantage\u201d in the face of cheaper imports that are below EU standards. A no-deal Brexit is the \u201cstuff of nightmares\u201d for British farmers, National Farmers\u2019 Union president Minette Batters warned this morning. She said it was \u201cabsolutely shocking\u201d that with five weeks to go until Brexit, it was not clear to farmers what trade conditions they would be operating in or what the country\u2019s future agricultural policy would look like. It was also not clear whether fruit, flowers and vegetable growers would have access to a sizeable global seasonal workers scheme. \u201cI make no apology for saying that leaving the EU without a deal would be a catastrophe for British farming,\u201d she told the NFU annual conference in Birmingham. The business secretary, Greg Clark, has pulled out of a planned speech at manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF\u2019s conference in London. He is expected to make a Commons statement on the Honda closure instead. Richard Harrington, a junior minister at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, will take Clark\u2019s place at the conference. On defector-watch, Rob Powell of Sky News passes on a fairly blunt dismissal by Tory back bencher Nick Boles of suggestions that he\u2019s considering joining Umunna and co. The Huffpost had reported that the ex-minister, who has been threatened with deselection by his local Conservative party, had declined to rule out joining The Independent Group. Other polling being poured over today are the findings by Survation (first out of the traps last night) that some eight percent of voters would support a Centrist Party opposed to Brexit The full tables of that polling for the Daily Mail are here. Some reaction now to those McDonnell comments, which some commentators are viewing as a change in tone Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, and the attorney-general, Geoffrey Cox, are expected to return to Brussels on Wednesday, after two hours of talks over the backstop with the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, on Monday. It is understood that Cox laid out what he would need to revise his legal opinion. The two sides are exploring the possible legal means to reconcile the gap between the Irish protocol\u2019s description of the backstop as \u201ctemporary\u201d and its \u201cindefinite\u201d legal effect. Downing Street is banking on a change in Cox\u2019s legal opinion persuading Brexiters to back the deal. But there appears to be little hope of the withdrawal agreement itself being reopened as promised by the prime minister in January in response to the historic defeat of her deal with the EU by 230 votes. In an interview with Politico, Hunt said he expected a significant breakthrough in the next few days, insisting it would be \u201cdefinitely more than a clarification\u201d while falling short of a rewriting of the withdrawal agreement. The prime minister has until now been demanding a time limit on the backstop, a unilateral exit mechanism or its replacement with alternative arrangements. Renewed pressure on the British government is coming from the EU this morning as France\u2019s European Affairs Minister warned that an extension to Article 50 would only happen if there was a substantial shift in opinion within parliament. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said that Labour needs \u201ca mammoth, massive listening exercise\u201d and to address some of those criticisms that have been made of the party. But he played down suggestions that as many as 36 Labour MPs had been considering a split. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is that scale, but the key issue for us - and it was made clear at the Parliamentary Labour Party, Tom Watson said it and others - the Labour leadership, and I\u2019m part of that, we need to keep listening, bring people in, talk to them,\u201d he told Sky News. McDonnell said the \u201conly disagreement we have had within the party is around how we handle Brexit and I think we are bringing people together on that.\u201d Jeremy Hunt has seized on Labour\u2019s split, claiming to European foreign ministers it proved that only concessions to win round Conservative rightwingers will get the Brexit deal through the Commons. The Guardian Brussels Bureau Chief, Dan Boffey, is reporting that the foreign secretary privately counselled his EU counterparts that the opposition could not be relied upon, even if the government pivoted to backing a customs union. The peeling away of seven MPs from the Labour party was said by Hunt during a frenetic day of lobbying in Brussels Monday to illustrate that the Brexit deal would only be saved by addressing Tory and DUP concerns about the \u201cindefinite\u201d nature of the Irish backstop, which could keep the UK in a customs union to avoid a hard Irish border. A full story will be live shortly. The 1980s revival isn\u2019t being welcomed in all quarters however. The process of selecting a Labour candidate to replace Chuka Umunna will begin next week in Streatham, according to an email which the Red Roar website says has been sent out to members by Labour chairman Ian Lavery. So what do voters make of the Labour breakaway? Well, some initial polling suggests that a third of labour backers are behind them The Guardian\u2019s Josh Halliday was on the ground yesterday meanwhile speaking to constituents of Angela Smith about her decision to leave Labour. It wasn\u2019t always pretty reading for the South Yorkshire MP. \u201cGood riddance,\u201d said Mick Drewry, 66, breaking off from a game of snooker as the news was replayed on a television screen nearby. \u201cCome the next election I\u2019d already made my mind up \u2013 I just can\u2019t vote for Angela Smith.\u201d Drewry, a retired steelworker, has always voted for Labour but said Smith and others had consistently undermined Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cShe certainly doesn\u2019t support Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 she\u2019s made that plain,\u201d he said. Smith, the former shadow leader of the Commons, has long been a Corbyn critic, putting her at odds with many local Labour members. In November, she lost a vote of no confidence held by her local constituency Labour party and blamed the result on a \u201ccabal of hard-left\u201d activists. Following Smith\u2019s announcement, the local party said the MP should \u201ctake the honourable path\u201d and resign her seat to trigger a byelection, allowing Labour \u201cto move on and challenge her at the ballot box\u201d. The Business Secretary Greg Clark has put out a statement on Honday, in which he sought to highlight the company\u2019s stated reasons -- not Brexit -- for the closure \u201cAs Honda have said, this is a commercial decision based on unprecedented changes in the global market,\u201d he said. Needless to say, there is intense skepticism about that rationale, not least from workers at the plant who have been linking the closure to Brexit. There\u2019s rolling coverage of what has been happening with Swindon on our business blog. The Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey has said she recognised that the decision of the several MPs to leave party was \u201cagonising.\u201d However, she insisted on the need for a \u201cunited front\u201d at a time when the \u201cConservative government was bungling Brexit,\u201d while crime, poverty and homelessness were rising. \u201cWhatever people\u2019s concerns are with our politics or the decisions that any of our front bench colleagues made on things we need to have those discussions within the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP). But we also have a duty to unify,\u201d she told the BBC. Long-Bailey also went on the offensive against the government over the Honda\u2019s Swindon closure. While the company has said that the closure was not related to Brexit, the MP said that it was important to get to the bottom of the factors behind the decision. The failure of the government to put forward an industrial strategy that supported car manufacturers and others could be one factor, she added. The new \u2018Independent Group\u2019 of former Labour MPs is inviting anybody who wants to fix Britain\u2019s \u201cbroken politics\u201d to come and join them, Chuka Umunna has said. That includes Tory MPs who were fed up with what he described as the \u201cUkipisation\u201d of the Conservative Party, he told the BBC\u2019s Today programme. The south London MP, perhaps the most high profile of the several who split from Labour on Monday, came under pressure to rebuff suggestions that the new group was essentially standing on a \u2018negative\u2019 rather than a \u2018positive\u2019 platform. In other words, they oppose Brexit and \u201cdon\u2019t like\u201d Jeremy Corbyn and his team. Not at all, replied Umunna, who insisted that they wanted to provide an alternative that voters were crying out for, not that a new political party was immediately in the offing. \u201cThis is day two, we have only just left the Labour party. We need an alternative but you can\u2019t cook that up in the committee rooms of Westminster,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t deny we want to present people with a new alternative. It could be a new party. it could be a movement,\u201d he said later in the interview. Umunna said that he and the others who had departed from Labour had faced a moral dilemma where they could not longer support the Labour leader and work to put him in power. The MP rejected suggestions that the new group was, \u201cat best,\u201d a distraction from the broader campaign against Brexit, which he has been a key part of through the moves to press for a second referendum. \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that we had exhausted any capacity to do that [within Labour],\u201d he said. In a reference to some of the rows over national security policy that have engulfed Labour in recent years, Umunna also said that he and his colleagues had had a particular issue with the narratives of states hostile to the UK finding favour with some in Labour. Earlier, Umunna told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain: \u201cWe are not the SDP. This is a different century.\u201d Asked when the group of MPs could evolve into a new centre party with a name and more members, he said: \u201cI would like to see us move as quickly as possible and certainly by the end of the year, but that\u2019s my personal view.\u201d He added: \u201cThere needs to be an alternative, so that\u2019s perfectly possible. But I don\u2019t get to determine this.\u201d Honda has confirmed plans to shut its factory in Swindon in 2021 with the loss of 3,500 jobs. The decision is not Brexit related, the BBC\u2019s Today Programme has been told by Ian Howells of Honda. \u201cWe are in a position where out investment and focus needs to go somewhere else, it can\u2019 be in the UK,\u201d he said, blaming the move on the \u2018global outlook\u2019. In a statement, the Japanese firm told workers it proposed to close the vehicle manufacturing plant at the end of the current model\u2019s production lifecycle. The plant currently produces 150,000 cars a year. The statement said: \u201cThis proposal comes as Honda accelerates its commitment to electrified cars, in response to the unprecedented changes in the global automotive industry. \u201cThe significant challenges of electrification will see Honda revise its global manufacturing operations, and focus activity in regions where it expects to have high production volumes.\u201d Someone who has been going in the opposite direction to the seven Labour MPs who quit the party yesterday is Derek Hatton, the former deputy leader of Liverpool City Council. Speaking after it was reported he had formally been readmitted to the Labour Party 34 years after being expelled, the former key figure in the Militant Tendency told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cOf course it\u2019s good to be back, in fact in a way I\u2019ve never left. \u201cFor 34 years I\u2019ve stayed absolutely solid with the Labour Party. Never joined any other party, never actually voted for another party. Never campaigned for another party. \u201c \u201cAnd, believe you me, during the times of the Blair era, the Iraq war, the ending of clause four, etc, it wasn\u2019t easy, and it was tempting to go. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why when you look at the seven who now have left you think, well, how pathetic is it, how really strong are you within the Labour movement to want to run away when there is something that you disagree with?\u201d There\u2019s a memorable cameo by Hatton in this clip of Neil Kinnock speaking at Labour\u2019s 1985 conference (it was already being shared yesterday on social media) where the then leader took aim at Militant. In terms of analysis and opinion pieces today, the Times has one from Rachel Sylvester who warns that both the Conservatives and Labour are \u2018on the brink\u2019 because of divisions. She writes: In these uncertain times, one thing is clear: there is a gap in the political market on the centre ground. The new independent group of MPs is the first step towards it being filled. In the Guardian, Polly Toynbee recalls her own role in the formation of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) but describes yesterday\u2019s split as a \u201cdangerous distraction\u201d at a time when all efforts should be behind opposing Brexit: Seven is a pitifully small number. The timing is monstrously badly judged and the reasons the MPs give are oddly scattergun, lacking political punch and focus. The Labour MP, Chris Bryant, writes in the New Statesman on why he will not be leaving the party: Unless politics is just about listening to the sound of your own voice or getting something of your chest, you have to work with others to get results. We achieve far more, as they say, by our common endeavour, than by going it alone. Sometimes that means not just putting up with strange bedfellows for a while, but shacking up long-term with people you don\u2019t always agree with or even like. Monday\u2019s split by several Labour MPs is prominent on the front pages this morning. Most Fleet Street titles lead with Labour deputy leader Tom Watson\u2019s warning to Jeremy Corbyn that more resignations will follow if he doesn\u2019t bring change to the party. Among them, the Mirror might have scooped the headline of the day: And from an editorial viewpoint that has been particularly supportive of the Labour leadership, here\u2019s the Morning Star\u2019s take: Here\u2019s an overall round up of what the papers say: Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s liveblog coverage politics liveblog. We\u2019ll be bringing you rolling coverage of events and stories including the continuing fallout on day two of the split from Labour by seven MPs. It\u2019s also a day where Brexit once again looms as the Brexit secretary briefs the cabinet on the latest talks with Brussels and uncertainty about Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe is being blamed for Honda\u2019s decision to announce the closure of its Swindon car plant with the loss of 3,500 jobs. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is expected to focus on Brexit during a speech (1330) at the EFF manufacturers organisation. Other speakers include Business Secretary Greg Clark (1200) and Chancellor Philip Hammond.",

He wanted to know if it was possible to hatch a supermarket egg, so he bought an incubator on eBay for \u00a340 and half a dozen free-range duck eggs from Waitrose. Three days later, when he shone a torch on to one of the eggs, he was amazed to see a beating heart; three weeks later the egg started to rock; and then, 28 days on from the start of his experiment, a duckling hatched.</p> <p>This is very nice news for William and Jeremy, the duckling, but a little worrying for the egg industry. \u201cPeople have a dual relationship with eggs,\u201d says Mark Diacono, the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/chicken-eggs.html\" title=\"\">The Chicken &amp; Eggs River Cottage Handbook</a>. \u201cThey love to eat them, but don\u2019t want to think too hard about what they actually are.\u201d Which, he says, is part of the female reproductive cycle. </p> <p>The great majority of eggs, whether from ducks or chickens, will not be fertilised. \u201cYou are not going to open a box of eggs, crack them and a chick will fall out,\u201d says Diacono, reassuringly. Commercial egg producers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2014/feb/27/how-ethical-are-your-eggs\" title=\"\">kill off male chicks at birth</a> \u2013 a subject they prefer not to talk about \u2013 to try to ensure their flocks are female-only. The odd rogue male may, however, get through, which is what appears to have happened in this case. Clarence Court, the company that produced William\u2019s duck eggs, is unsure how it happened, suggesting that either a male was accidentally allowed to enter the flock by their sexing experts or a wild drake managed to sneak in.</p> <p>Producers of hens\u2019 eggs are, for obvious reasons, desperate to quash the suggestion that your boiled egg is a potential chick. \u201cIn commercial egg production, males and females are separated at around a day old and are kept separately,\u201d says Lucy Egerton, a British Egg Industry Council spokeswoman. \u201cWe believe in commercial egg production the sexing process is accurate. We don\u2019t think this could happen in a commercial laying flock, though it could happen in a backyard flock.\u201d</p> <p>Margaret Manchester, the managing director of Durham Hens, which supplies hens to the hobbyist market, points out that even a fertilised egg is not a living creature. \u201cThere is no embryo until heat is applied either through the hen sitting on the egg or by putting it in an incubator.\u201d She says a fertilised egg doesn\u2019t taste any different and won\u2019t harm you. Indeed, in the days when most eggs came from farms that kept cockerels, almost all eggs would have been fertilised. She says you can spot a fertilised egg by looking at the yolk: in place of a usual small white spot, <a href=\"http://chickscope.beckman.uiuc.edu/explore/embryology/day01/yolk.html\" title=\"\">you will see a ring</a>. But it is a myth that the presence of blood spots is a sign that the egg is fertilised. \u201cBlood spots are just something that can happen in the egg-laying process,\u201d she says.</p> <p>While \u201call this is about potential rather than reality\u201d, as Diacono says, it does remind us that eggs have the capacity for life. That doesn\u2019t mean we should all become vegans, he says, but it does encourage us to reassess our relationship with food. \u201cEveryone has to draw the line on what they will and won\u2019t eat,\u201d says Diacono.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Fourteen-year-old William Atkins has put the cat among the pigeons \u2013 or perhaps the fox among the ducklings. He wanted to know if it was possible to hatch a supermarket egg, so he bought an incubator on eBay for \u00a340 and half a dozen free-range duck eggs from Waitrose. Three days later, when he shone a torch on to one of the eggs, he was amazed to see a beating heart; three weeks later the egg started to rock; and then, 28 days on from the start of his experiment, a duckling hatched. This is very nice news for William and Jeremy, the duckling, but a little worrying for the egg industry. \u201cPeople have a dual relationship with eggs,\u201d says Mark Diacono, the author of The Chicken &amp; Eggs River Cottage Handbook. \u201cThey love to eat them, but don\u2019t want to think too hard about what they actually are.\u201d Which, he says, is part of the female reproductive cycle. The great majority of eggs, whether from ducks or chickens, will not be fertilised. \u201cYou are not going to open a box of eggs, crack them and a chick will fall out,\u201d says Diacono, reassuringly. Commercial egg producers kill off male chicks at birth \u2013 a subject they prefer not to talk about \u2013 to try to ensure their flocks are female-only. The odd rogue male may, however, get through, which is what appears to have happened in this case. Clarence Court, the company that produced William\u2019s duck eggs, is unsure how it happened, suggesting that either a male was accidentally allowed to enter the flock by their sexing experts or a wild drake managed to sneak in. Producers of hens\u2019 eggs are, for obvious reasons, desperate to quash the suggestion that your boiled egg is a potential chick. \u201cIn commercial egg production, males and females are separated at around a day old and are kept separately,\u201d says Lucy Egerton, a British Egg Industry Council spokeswoman. \u201cWe believe in commercial egg production the sexing process is accurate. We don\u2019t think this could happen in a commercial laying flock, though it could happen in a backyard flock.\u201d Margaret Manchester, the managing director of Durham Hens, which supplies hens to the hobbyist market, points out that even a fertilised egg is not a living creature. \u201cThere is no embryo until heat is applied either through the hen sitting on the egg or by putting it in an incubator.\u201d She says a fertilised egg doesn\u2019t taste any different and won\u2019t harm you. Indeed, in the days when most eggs came from farms that kept cockerels, almost all eggs would have been fertilised. She says you can spot a fertilised egg by looking at the yolk: in place of a usual small white spot, you will see a ring. But it is a myth that the presence of blood spots is a sign that the egg is fertilised. \u201cBlood spots are just something that can happen in the egg-laying process,\u201d she says. While \u201call this is about potential rather than reality\u201d, as Diacono says, it does remind us that eggs have the capacity for life. That doesn\u2019t mean we should all become vegans, he says, but it does encourage us to reassess our relationship with food. \u201cEveryone has to draw the line on what they will and won\u2019t eat,\u201d says Diacono.",

For now, the group has no name or leader for a new party, let alone policies or a manifesto. It meets this week to decide on the next steps \u2013 and much will depend on whether more MPs join them. Some members of the Independent Group have their own policy ideas which they are likely to be keen to promote. Leslie promoted a pamphlet of his ideas for a centrist party, published last year. Among the ideas in the pamphlet are closing loopholes in inheritance tax, a harmonised rate of 30% pensions tax relief to support savings for retirement and auto-enrolment for critical illness and life insurance, and abolishing \u201cfree\u201d masters degrees awarded by Oxford and Cambridge.",

Thanks to his disputed birth date, these dates are estimated.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 1, 1955)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Early years</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Lagerfeld began his career as an assistant at Balmain, after winning a design competition. Three years later, he went to work for couturier Jean Patou.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 1, 1958)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Early criticism </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His first few collections were not well received. His dresses, inspired by the shape of the letter \u201cK\u201d for Karl, were met with boos from the press. His 1960 collection of skirts were deemed too short.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 1, 1960)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Chlo\u00e9</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His breakthrough came when he started freelancing for Chlo\u00e9 in the 1960s and 1970s, where his velvet shorts and skirts inspired by Carmen Miranda were described as \u201chigh fashion\u201d and \u201chigh camp\u201d.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 1, 1965)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Fendi</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He began what would be a lifelong collaboration with Fendi, an Italian label known for its accessories and heavy use of fur.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 1, 1983)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Chanel </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Lagerfeld becomes chief designer for Chanel and swiftly becomes one of the industry\u2019s most established and beloved designers. He swiftly introduces the interlocking CC logo, introduced updated versions of tweed and lots of gold, which have become Chanel\u2019s most famous trademarks.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(February 19, 2004)</i>&nbsp;<strong>High street</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Lagerfeld collaborates with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%26M\">H&amp;M</a>&nbsp;on a capsule collection.

A year later, in a bid to remain relevant in a changing market, Chanel announced that it would ban fur and exotic skins from its collections.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 1, 2019)</i>&nbsp;<strong> Last days</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Lagerfeld is absent from the Chanel&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jan/22/karl-lagerfeld-misses-chanel-haute-couture-shows-in-paris\">haute couture show</a>&nbsp;in Paris, fuelling speculation about his health.

The force spent more than \u00a3500,000 on the ammunition in 2017 \u2013 more than three times the average annual spend for the previous five years. The figures have emerged amid growing fears about the potential for a no-deal Brexit to result in civil disorder. Last month, the Guardian learned that almost 1,000 police officers from England and Scotland were due to begin training for deployment in Northern Ireland in case of trouble in the event of no deal. A freedom of information request by the Guardian revealed forces across the country have spent more than \u00a38.2m on stocks over the past seven years, with spending dramatically increasing in the years after the 2011 riots. The figures are based on the amounts paid to the Home Office for the provision of what are officially known as attenuating energy projectiles (AEPs). While they continue to be used by police in Northern Ireland, they have never been used by forces in Great Britain when confronted with street disorder. Reacting to the figures, Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said: \u201cIt is very concerning that police forces would want to stockpile such weapons. \u201cThe money that public bodies have been forced to spend preparing for the potential outcomes of a no-deal Brexit would be better spent on ending the Tories\u2019 cuts to the police.\u201d Liberty also questioned the increase in spending and called on the police to rule out the use of plastic bullets, which the human rights group said could only serve to inflame tensions. \u201cPlastic bullets cause serious injuries and can kill.

The figure was \u00a3149,978 for the previous year. The total for the force since 2013 is \u00a31.2m. Sources at the force said the AEPs had been acquired because there were more firearms officers in training, resulting in existing stocks expiring. Spending has also been steadily increasing each year at Police Scotland, Britain\u2019s second largest police force, which was supplied in 2017 with \u00a3275,280 worth of AEPs and has been invoiced for \u00a3928,138.99 over the last seven years. The third biggest spender in recent times was the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, a specialist armed police service charged with protecting civil nuclear sites and safeguarding nuclear material in transit, which was invoiced for a total of \u00a3893,638.48 since 2013. An official report into policing of the August 2011 disturbances in English cities revealed police had wanted to fire plastic bullets at rioters in south London but were unable to do so because specialist units had been deployed elsewhere in the capital. The Met\u2019s response to the riots also revealed the force had increased its capacity since the riots \u201cto make more agile use\u201d of the weapons. Plastic bullets have been linked to the deaths in Northern Ireland of at least 17 people, eight of whom were children. According to figures recorded by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), they were discharged on two occasions of public disorder during April to the end of September last year. Four rounds were fired at two males who were responsible for throwing petrol bombs and improvised explosive devices at police lines. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, an independent public body funded by the Northern Ireland Office, said it had raised the issue of the use of AEPs repeatedly with the UK government and at the United Nations.

She went there to find out the truth on the ground because she served in uniform in a war that we were lied into by the Bush administration,\u201d said Ray Alt, who launched his \u201cRun Tulsi Run\u201d Facebook group during the 2016 campaign.</p> <p>Christine Green traveled from Amesbury, Massachusetts to see Gabbard speak. Wearing a lei around her neck at a town hall event in North Hampton \u2013 as Gabbard often does \u2013 she told the Guardian she was 98% sure that the congresswoman was her top choice.</p> <p>On criticisms of Gabbard, she said: \u201cI believe a lot of it is literally a smear campaign, the negative stuff.\u201d The attention paid to the congresswoman\u2019s past LGBT record was unfair, she said, given Gabbard\u2019s reversal and apologies.</p> <p>At that same town hall, when one voter said he admired Gabbard for meeting with Assad, the room erupted in applause.</p> <p> Not everybody the congresswoman encountered was willing to so easily dismiss the criticisms.</p> <p>Watching Gabbard speak at a vegan restaurant in Portsmouth was Barbara DeStefano, vice-chair of the Portsmouth Democrats. She said she was uneasy about Gabbard\u2019s trip to Syria and remarks about the conflict.</p> <p>\u201cIt does give me pause that she did that. She has to hopefully get away from that as the campaign goes on,\u201d she said. </p>",

Her campaign website has posted: \u201cThe corporate media is doing everything they can to stop our campaign before it gets started \u2013 including using fraudulent journalism and discredited sources to launch their biased attacks.\u201d Asked about this message, Gabbard told the Guardian it was a direct reference to a recent NBC News article that \u201cwas citing discredited experts in an attempt to smear my campaign.\u201d She said she did not agree with Trump\u2019s characterizations of the media, but would call out stories that \u201care not based in facts\u201d. \u201cYou guys as journalists have an important responsibility, as you know, to deliver the truth,\u201d she added. \u201cSo this isn\u2019t about favorable or unfavorable, it\u2019s about the facts. And if you\u2019re not reporting the facts, then you\u2019re doing a disservice to the people.\u201d Like the candidate, many supporters are quick to dismiss her interactions with Syria. Instead, they say criticism over that and her past opposition to LGBT rights is the result of a smear campaign. \u201cTulsi is not an Assad apologist or any of that nonsense. She went there to find out the truth on the ground because she served in uniform in a war that we were lied into by the Bush administration,\u201d said Ray Alt, who launched his \u201cRun Tulsi Run\u201d Facebook group during the 2016 campaign. Christine Green traveled from Amesbury, Massachusetts to see Gabbard speak. Wearing a lei around her neck at a town hall event in North Hampton \u2013 as Gabbard often does \u2013 she told the Guardian she was 98% sure that the congresswoman was her top choice. On criticisms of Gabbard, she said: \u201cI believe a lot of it is literally a smear campaign, the negative stuff.\u201d The attention paid to the congresswoman\u2019s past LGBT record was unfair, she said, given Gabbard\u2019s reversal and apologies. At that same town hall, when one voter said he admired Gabbard for meeting with Assad, the room erupted in applause. Not everybody the congresswoman encountered was willing to so easily dismiss the criticisms. Watching Gabbard speak at a vegan restaurant in Portsmouth was Barbara DeStefano, vice-chair of the Portsmouth Democrats. She said she was uneasy about Gabbard\u2019s trip to Syria and remarks about the conflict. \u201cIt does give me pause that she did that. She has to hopefully get away from that as the campaign goes on,\u201d she said.",

I was bored stiff until a Newport player kicked the oval ball into touch, hitting my brother full in his face. He was fine after a little TLC from the St John\u2019s Ambulance crew. The next game we attended was Newport County v Southend United and this game was more memorable. Newport won 4-1, but what I remember was the Newport fans giving hell to Southend player Tony Bentley every time he touched the ball.

      "bodyText": "SUCKING THEM DOWN Maurizio Sarri rolled out of bed on Tuesday morning, then rolled his first cigarette of the day. Then he rolled his second and third, before lighting the first one. That\u2019s standard practice, ensuring that, providing he keeps a steady pace, rolling one while smoking one, he\u2019ll always have a buffer of two rollies, just in case he\u2019s forced to break away momentarily to work on some other project, such as deciding which set of scrubs to wear for the match, or which minute he plans to replace Pedro with Anyone But Callum Hudson-Odoi. Then he slapped a few Nicorette patches on to his arms, popped a strip of NRT gum in his mouth, slipped a pouch of dip under each eyelid, and he was up and running for the day. Well, you\u2019ve got to get your stimulation somehow, and watching Chelsea at the moment would send a glass eye to sleep. On Monday night in the FA Cup, Manchester United became the latest team to realise that all you need to do to beat this rabble is let them pass it sideways quite a lot, wait until Eden Hazard gets either tuckered out or fed up with being lumbered with all the creative responsibility and slips into a sulk, and bang bang, the holders are out. So while it was a great night for the next permanent manager of United \u2013 they\u2019ve got to give it him \u2013 it wasn\u2019t such a banner evening for Sarriball, a philosophy once famous for making Napoli half-decent, but now heavily critiqued by the denizens of the Matthew Harding Stand in the intense colloquial style. The result ensured Sarri\u2019s breakfast was completely ruined. Over a quick cup of tea and 40 JPS, he flicked through the morning papers, many of which suggested his reign at Stamford Bridge will end very soon, if not sooner. Chelsea presumably wouldn\u2019t be so brazen to get rid before the Milk Cup final on Sunday, but once that humiliation\u2019s out of the way, all bets will be off. Zinedine Zidane, Gianfranco Zola, Laurent Blanc, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Plain Old John Terry have been touted as ready-to-go replacements, while Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County boss Frank Lampard has been variously quoted as a 4-1 shoo-in and a 33-1 outsider. In conclusion, nobody knows anything \u2026 apart from the likelihood of Sarri soon being handed his metaphorical pipe and slippers.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cWe see an opportunity to promote the brand of Spain without attacking sporting principles\u201d \u2013 Luis Rubiales confirms the Spanish FA has given its Super Cup a good old shake-up: from now on it will be a four-team travelling circus, a mini-tournament that will presumably be played in whichever country the suits reckon will earn them most coin every year.

I was only allowed to go because my parents made my older brother, Julian, take me \u2013 much to his annoyance. The first game was a rugby match between Newport RFC and Cardiff. I was bored stiff until a Newport player kicked the oval ball into touch, hitting my brother full in his face. He was fine after a little TLC from the St John\u2019s Ambulance crew. The next game we attended was Newport County v Southend United and this game was more memorable. Newport won 4-1, but what I remember was the Newport fans giving hell to Southend player Tony Bentley every time he touched the ball. This resulted in Bentley getting angry and kicking the ball out of play \u2026 where (once again), it landed in my brother\u2019s face. Needless to say, my brother never took me to another game\u201d \u2013 Mike Dax. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport.

Commissioner Cressida Dick and the Met\u2019s head of human resources, Clare Davies, briefed journalists about the progress made, to mark the 20th anniversary of the landmark Macpherson report. The report in 1999 found the London force was institutionally racist and that in part explained why errors by Met officers had allowed the racist murderers of Stephen Lawrence to escape justice. It would take until 2012 for two of a gang of at least five to be convicted of the murder.

The Met wants 35% of new recruits to be ethnic minority, an extra 250 new cadets a year, and Davies said: \u201cFor many the progress is too slow.\u201d She added: \u201cIt does take time to see the difference, particularly at senior levels.\u201d The Met is aiming for 19% of officers to be from an ethnic minority by 2022, but is thousands of minority officers short and is expected to remain so for decades. Dick said the Met has transformed and is no longer institutionally racist, as she said the headline finding from Macpherson was redundant. \u201c I don\u2019t feel it is now a useful way to describe the service and I don\u2019t believe we are. \u201cI simply don\u2019t see it as a helpful or accurate description.\u201d The institutionally racist description should never have been applied, some in the Met believe, and some officers claim to have felt it was a personal slur accusing them as individuals of prejudice. Macpherson had said in the report: \u201cIt can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people.\u201d Dick added: \u201cThere is an absolute determination to have zero tolerance for racism\u201d, and also to reexamine every significant thing the Met does to improve. Her view sets Dick apart from policing colleagues, such as the Black Police Association, and other police chiefs. Last year Gareth Wilson, lead for the National Police Chiefs Council on diversity, told the Guardian: \u201cI think if you look at where we are and what Macpherson said, you could argue that the definition is still true today.\u201d Nationally, 7% of police officers are from a black or minority ethnic (BAME) background, compared with 14% in the population. Previous senior police leaders in the Met have worried that the large race gap damaged their legitimacy and ability to police by consent. Dick said: \u201cIn communities people do genuinely respond often to somebody who speaks their language, literally \u2026 It does clearly help.\u201d She said she was not pursuing an argument with government to change the law to allow positive discrimination, such as that in Northern Ireland which saw more Catholics recruited to a predominantly protestant force.

The animated sequel declined by a reasonable 38% from its opening session, and stands at \u00a37.41m after 10 days.</p> <p>With most schools on half-term, the Lego movie should enjoy strong business this week. It faces competition from DreamWorks Animation\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/31/how-to-train-your-dragon-the-hidden-world-review-jay-baruchel-america-ferrara\">How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World</a>, which managed \u00a31.65m at the weekend. By releasing a week earlier, the Viking adventure has built up a higher total, \u00a311.5m, and will probably retain a lead over its Lego rival at the end of the films\u2019 runs.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUfZq3DUd3Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IUfZq3DUd3Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2><strong>The runner-up: Instant Family</strong></h2> <p>Boosted by previews totalling \u00a3485,000 and with takings just below \u00a32.47m, Instant Family almost pipped The Lego Movie 2. Less than \u00a33,000 separated the two films, although Instant Family had the benefit of its previews tally.</p> <p>The film represents a change of tone for Sean Anders who had writing and/or directing credits on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jan/09/sex-drive-review\">Sex Drive</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/22/were-the-millers-review\">We\u2019re the Millers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/27/horrible-bosses-2-review\">Horrible Bosses 2</a> and both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/24/daddys-home-2-review-mel-gibson-wahlberg-ferrell\">Daddy\u2019s Home</a> films. Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne star as a married couple who adopt a set of young siblings. The comedy-drama is inspired by the experiences of Anders and his wife, who themselves adopted three children.</p> <p>Instant Family opened in the US in November, beginning with $14.5m on its way to $67m. Not counting previews, the UK debut number is \u00a31.95m \u2013 by industry rule of thumb, that\u2019s ahead of the UK equivalent of the US opening figure (which would be \u00a31.45m). Instant Family has a 12A certificate, and might hold up reasonably well during the half-term holiday.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJlxP5P9v9c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cJlxP5P9v9c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2><strong>The disappointment: The Kid Who Would Be King</strong></h2> <p>Landing in seventh place, family adventure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/14/the-kid-who-would-be-king-review-joe-cornish-louis-ashbourne-serkis\">The Kid Who Would Be King</a> struggled to define its niche. Unlike the Lego or Dragon films, the live-action quest tale doesn\u2019t benefit from a strong recognition factor \u2013 unless you count the King Arthur legend, on which the story draws. Director Joe Cornish previously made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/12/attack-the-block-review\">Attack the Block</a>, which had a distinctly different audience skew.</p> <p>The Kid Who Would Be King began with an uninspiring \u00a3667,000, including modest previews. Attack the Block began with \u00a3837,000 (\u00a31.13m, including previews) in May 2011. Cornish has enjoyed bigger success as a screenwriter, with credits on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/16/ant-man-review-paul-rudd-marvel\">Ant-Man</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/27/the-adventures-of-tintin-review\">The Adventures of Tintin</a>.</p> <h2><strong>The bounce back: The Favourite</strong></h2> <p>Seven wins at the Bafta film awards, including best actress, helped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/30/the-favourite-review-olivia-colman-yorgos-lanthimos\">The Favourite</a> to a strong result at the weekend. Returning to the Top 10, it saw box office rise by 14% from the previous session. Total after seven weeks is \u00a315.3m, which puts it just ahead of the lifetime tally for one of 2018\u2019s big awards-season winners, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/12/three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri-review-frances-mcdormand\">Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri</a>.</p> <p>The Favourite faced competition from other awards-friendly releases, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/30/green-book-review-mahershala-ali-viggo-mortensen-peter-farrelly\">Green Book</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/06/if-beale-street-could-talk-review-barry-jenkins-kiki-layne-stephan-james\">If Beale Street Could Talk</a> \u2013 the latter boosted by its expansion from 52 to 339 cinemas.

Takings are 59% down on the same weekend a year ago \u2013 predictably, given that the big new release on that occasion was Marvel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/06/black-panther-review-marvel-wakanda-chadwick-boseman\">Black Panther</a>.

      "bodyText": "The winner: The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part Despite a strong challenge from Instant Family, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part hung on at the top, with weekend takings of \u00a32.47m. The animated sequel declined by a reasonable 38% from its opening session, and stands at \u00a37.41m after 10 days. With most schools on half-term, the Lego movie should enjoy strong business this week. It faces competition from DreamWorks Animation\u2019s How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, which managed \u00a31.65m at the weekend. By releasing a week earlier, the Viking adventure has built up a higher total, \u00a311.5m, and will probably retain a lead over its Lego rival at the end of the films\u2019 runs. The runner-up: Instant Family Boosted by previews totalling \u00a3485,000 and with takings just below \u00a32.47m, Instant Family almost pipped The Lego Movie 2. Less than \u00a33,000 separated the two films, although Instant Family had the benefit of its previews tally. The film represents a change of tone for Sean Anders who had writing and/or directing credits on Sex Drive, We\u2019re the Millers, Horrible Bosses 2 and both Daddy\u2019s Home films. Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne star as a married couple who adopt a set of young siblings. The comedy-drama is inspired by the experiences of Anders and his wife, who themselves adopted three children. Instant Family opened in the US in November, beginning with $14.5m on its way to $67m. Not counting previews, the UK debut number is \u00a31.95m \u2013 by industry rule of thumb, that\u2019s ahead of the UK equivalent of the US opening figure (which would be \u00a31.45m). Instant Family has a 12A certificate, and might hold up reasonably well during the half-term holiday. The disappointment: The Kid Who Would Be King Landing in seventh place, family adventure The Kid Who Would Be King struggled to define its niche. Unlike the Lego or Dragon films, the live-action quest tale doesn\u2019t benefit from a strong recognition factor \u2013 unless you count the King Arthur legend, on which the story draws. Director Joe Cornish previously made Attack the Block, which had a distinctly different audience skew. The Kid Who Would Be King began with an uninspiring \u00a3667,000, including modest previews. Attack the Block began with \u00a3837,000 (\u00a31.13m, including previews) in May 2011. Cornish has enjoyed bigger success as a screenwriter, with credits on Ant-Man and The Adventures of Tintin. The bounce back: The Favourite Seven wins at the Bafta film awards, including best actress, helped The Favourite to a strong result at the weekend. Returning to the Top 10, it saw box office rise by 14% from the previous session. Total after seven weeks is \u00a315.3m, which puts it just ahead of the lifetime tally for one of 2018\u2019s big awards-season winners, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. The Favourite faced competition from other awards-friendly releases, Green Book and If Beale Street Could Talk \u2013 the latter boosted by its expansion from 52 to 339 cinemas. Below The Favourite in the chart are Mary Queen of Scots, Vice, Can You Ever Forgive Me?, Stan &amp; Ollie, All Is True, Boy Erased, Beautiful Boy and Colette. Also in the mix is A Private War, starring Rosamund Pike as fearless war reporter Marie Colvin. The biographical drama began with a decent \u00a3103,000 from 74 sites (\u00a3223,000, including previews). The market Worryingly, the UK market is down on the equivalent session from 2018 for the sixth weekend in a row. Takings are 59% down on the same weekend a year ago \u2013 predictably, given that the big new release on that occasion was Marvel\u2019s Black Panther. Salvation does not appear to be immediately at hand: the major releases this weekend include Liam Neeson crime thriller Cold Pursuit (which has grossed $21m in the US in 10 days) and Felicity Jones as US supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in biographical drama On the Basis of Sex. Neeson\u2019s recent race-attack remarks may be considered unhelpful. Top 10 films, 15-17 February 1. The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part, \u00a32,472,489 from 652 sites.

      "body": "<p>In a single day, the Labour party has lost Luciana Berger and \u201cgained\u201d Derek Hatton. As swaps go, this isn\u2019t dissimilar to giving someone an orgasm and them giving you gonorrhoea: the loss of a hard-working, campaigning constituency MP (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/feb/18/we-have-resigned-seven-labour-mps-quit-video-highlights\">Berger was among seven MPs to resign from Labour</a>) and the official welcoming back, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HannahAlOthman/status/1097581356589162496\">by a three-person panel</a>, of a man so odious that he infamously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/23/labour-brexit-peoples-vote-liverpool\">delivered redundancy notices</a> by taxi to his own council staff.</p> \n<p>To sum up Hatton in a brief vignette: at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour-conference-2016\">2016 Labour party conference</a> in Liverpool, I was in a coffee shop searching for wifi, and hit on a hotspot someone had called \u201cDerek Twatton\u201d.</p> \n<p>Liverpudlians don\u2019t even need to have been born during Hatton\u2019s 80s tenure as deputy leader of Liverpool city council to know the havoc he wreaked on the city. As with stories of Beatlemania, Hillsborough, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/26/how-the-suns-truth-about-hillsborough-unravelled\">The Sun</a>, and later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/nov/30/ukcrime.race1\">Anthony Walker</a>, Scousers pass their history on. But for those who don\u2019t know who Hatton is: he was a member of the Trotskyist faction Militant Tendency, and became deputy council leader just five weeks before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/05/1983-cameron-victory-kinnocks-words\">Margaret Thatcher\u2019s 1983 landslide</a> win (and Michael Foot\u2019s disaster). The Labour council was the first majority one in a decade for the city.</p> \n<p>Hatton, who eclipsed the mild-mannered leader, John Hamilton, was right to be furious with central government grant cuts and underfunding of Liverpool during Geoffrey Howe\u2019s mooted \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/30/thatcher-government-liverpool-riots-1981\">managed decline</a>\u201d policy for the city after the riots of 1981, and when changes in shipping practices \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32913465\">rise in the use of containers</a> in particular \u2013 were having a devastating impact on a proud port. Deprivation and unemployment were widespread. But Hatton\u2019s response was to set an illegal budget \u2013 expenditure exceeding income \u2013 and to gamble that the government would make up the \u00a330m overspend. Other councils also affected by central government grant cuts managed to set legal budgets.</p> \n<p>The debt Hatton plunged Liverpool into was <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/mike-storey-debt-left-militant-3572497\">finally cleared 15 years later, in 2001</a>. The interest rate paid over this time amounted to 57%. The Militant loans? They came from <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/economics/2013/06/militant-liverpool-diane-frost-and-peter-north-secret-revival-we-stopped-feeling-s\">Swiss, Japanese and French banks</a>. But Hatton\u2019s nadir came when he hired taxis to deliver redundancy notices to the council\u2019s 31,000 staff, on the basis that the council couldn\u2019t afford to pay them, as a \u201ctactic\u201d to extend negotiations of the Whitehall stalemate. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a2e86e337c5da645a9627818ba3ed6fc320114e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a2e86e337c5da645a9627818ba3ed6fc320114e/0_46_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An anti-Militant protest in Liverpool\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An anti-Militant protest in Liverpool</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manchester Daily Express/SSPL via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Away from finances, Hatton appointed an unknown Londoner, <a href=\"http://archive.workersliberty.org/publications/readings/trots/liverp.htm\">Sam Bond</a>, to the Liverpool Race Relations Liaison Committee over objections from the Black Caucus, at a time when racial tensions were especially high. Bond did not support affirmative action policies, and similarly, Militant did nothing for LGBT groups, given its <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q3Z5AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT113&amp;lpg=PT113&amp;dq=derek+hatton+lgbt&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=L5tOXddDQz&amp;sig=ACfU3U1c0RLjLpCD5JilTh7ijaGTw3ajKQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjqvLPd6MfgAhU_SxUIHYmHANY4ChDoATAAegQIChAB#v=onepage&amp;q=derek%20hatton%20lgbt&amp;f=false\">opposition to policies that focused on particular oppressed groups</a>. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militant_(Trotskyist_group)\">neutral office of lord mayor, meanwhile, was abolished</a>, to strengthen Militant\u2019s power.</p> \n<p>It is true that the council\u2019s Urban Regeneration Strategy managed a programme of house-building and delivered seven new sports centres. But the city facing bankruptcy meant schools were underfunded to the extent that they couldn\u2019t afford teachers, stationery or basic equipment or, in some cases, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q3Z5AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT52&amp;lpg=PT52&amp;dq=militant+school+heating+liverpool&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=L5tOXclDUv&amp;sig=ACfU3U3EgfEoCFGXoKh3eKf_Fr87Ej0vZQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjuruS04cfgAhXjVBUIHU3CDwMQ6AEwBnoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=militant%20school%20heating%20liverpool&amp;f=false\">electricity and heating</a>.</p> \n<p>Opposite my former school, there used to be Harthill Gardens, known as the \u201cKew Gardens of the north\u201d. When the gardeners were called out on strike, they rebelled, fearing the impact on the flora. In an act of political revenge, and a mark of his character, Hatton sacked the gardeners and bulldozed the gardens. A famous banner held aloft in protests against the council at the time read: \u201cHitler only destroyed half of our city. Hatton tried for the lot.\u201d</p> \n<p>Militant\u2019s grip on Liverpool came to an end with Neil Kinnock\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/labour_history/status/1097588071648952325\">famous speech</a> at Labour\u2019s Bournemouth conference in 1985. Then party leader, Kinnock blasted Hatton\u2019s running of the council as \u201cgrotesque chaos\u201d. The NEC eventually voted 12 to six to expel Militant members. Hatton was put on trial on corruption charges, in response to Merseyside police\u2019s brilliantly named <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/hatton-is-cleared-after-8-week-trial-the-investigation-into-alleged-corruption-continues-despite-the-1497373.html\">Operation Cheetah</a>, though he was eventually acquitted. Liverpool\u2019s economy did not recover until the late 1990s.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9d7ahKWcsM\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/v9d7ahKWcsM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Get ready for this bit, if you don\u2019t know the story.

around in a Jaguar</a> and wearing obnoxious metallic suits.</p> \n<p>In a 2008 Telegraph interview he boasted about his <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/fameandfortune/3129837/Fame-and-Fortune-Derek-Hatton-the-militant-capitalist.html\">\u00a360,000 Range Rover</a> and \u201csix-figure bracket\u201d salary. Cyprus, he said, was great, <a href=\"tel:There is low income tax (10 per cent), zero inheritance tax\">because it (then) had a 10% tax rate</a> (now 12.5%). As if this wholesale hypocrisy wasn\u2019t enough to turn the stomach, Hatton starred in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0tLFbA1PdE\">Sekonda \u201csolid gold\u201d watch advert</a>. \u201cMy attitude has always been that you don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ve got in this world, so spend what you have while it\u2019s there,\u201d Hatton said. No shit.</p> \n<p>This is the man Labour has just readmitted to the party. A man who was literally <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/king-rat-played-by-former-labour-militant-derek-hatton-in-news-photo/835098892\">cast as King Rat in a pantomime</a>. In recent years, Hatton has even turned his hand to <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/derek-hatton-courts-identity-defendants-11016485\">espousing ignorant ideas around rape cases</a>, because he is committed to always becoming that bit worse.</p> \n<p>But it is perhaps most egregious that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lucianaberger/status/1097609021606060032\">Berger\u2019s heartfelt statement on antisemitism</a> has been met with Hatton\u2019s readmittance. Just a few years ago, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MLewisLawyer/status/1097830880167510016\">Hatton tweeted about</a> \u201cJews with any sense of humanity\u201d. The intellectual vacuity of antisemites, unable to distinguish between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/23/netanyahu-israeli-apartheid-palestinians-nation-state-law\">Netanyahu\u2019s government</a> and past Israeli administrations and an entire group of historically oppressed people, or their right to a homeland, continues to take the breath away. It is a truly depressing thought, a morally vacant one.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2e0cfad7-48e2-49f3-8cfb-88a728c19d21\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/i2uU-XcH3aM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Stella Creasy has <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/former-militant-figure-derek-hatton-readmitted-to-labour-33-years-after-being-kicked-out-11641528\">told Sky News</a> that Hatton\u2019s return \u201cabsolutely beggars belief. I\u2019m not going to pretend otherwise\u201d. Lucy Powell has said the \u201ctiming could not be worse\u201d, while the former Welsh minister Alun Davies <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-47292287\">called the decision</a> \u201cappalling. I do not want to be in the same party as this man\u201d. Neither do I.</p> \n<p>Whatever one thinks of the newly formed Independent Group \u2013 and it has always been my view that those who resign the whip, or cross the floor, should stand in byelections \u2013 Labour\u2019s reaction is dreadful. Referring to himself in the third person Hatton <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/derek-hatton-labour-pathetic-luciana-berger_uk_5c6bda4ae4b01cea6b890d1d\">told Radio 4 this morning</a>: \u201cI can assure you, Derek Hatton will not be the candidate for Wavertree,\u201d referring to Berger\u2019s constituency seat. But \u201cDegsy\u201d, the nickname he gave himself and had made into a numberplate (DEG5Y) is back espousing socialist values he disavowed. He\u2019s sucking up to Jeremy Corbyn, though two years ago he wrote that he had \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Hatton\">serious doubts about him</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>In response to a query about how his new capitalist lifestyle aligned with his apparent socialist beliefs \u2013 Hatton <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/fameandfortune/3129837/Fame-and-Fortune-Derek-Hatton-the-militant-capitalist.html\">once said</a>: \u201cMy days in politics were a very long time ago and I lost interest in it after I was expelled from the city council.\u201d The man doesn\u2019t have an honest bone in his body. I hope someone writes him a note telling him where to stick it, and delivers it in a taxi. Derek Twatton, indeed.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Hannah Jane Parkinson is a Guardian columnist</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 February 2019 to correct the personalised numberplate; it was not DE5SY but was DEG5Y.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In a single day, the Labour party has lost Luciana Berger and \u201cgained\u201d Derek Hatton. As swaps go, this isn\u2019t dissimilar to giving someone an orgasm and them giving you gonorrhoea: the loss of a hard-working, campaigning constituency MP (Berger was among seven MPs to resign from Labour) and the official welcoming back, by a three-person panel, of a man so odious that he infamously delivered redundancy notices by taxi to his own council staff. To sum up Hatton in a brief vignette: at the 2016 Labour party conference in Liverpool, I was in a coffee shop searching for wifi, and hit on a hotspot someone had called \u201cDerek Twatton\u201d. Liverpudlians don\u2019t even need to have been born during Hatton\u2019s 80s tenure as deputy leader of Liverpool city council to know the havoc he wreaked on the city. As with stories of Beatlemania, Hillsborough, The Sun, and later Anthony Walker, Scousers pass their history on. But for those who don\u2019t know who Hatton is: he was a member of the Trotskyist faction Militant Tendency, and became deputy council leader just five weeks before Margaret Thatcher\u2019s 1983 landslide win (and Michael Foot\u2019s disaster). The Labour council was the first majority one in a decade for the city. Hatton, who eclipsed the mild-mannered leader, John Hamilton, was right to be furious with central government grant cuts and underfunding of Liverpool during Geoffrey Howe\u2019s mooted \u201cmanaged decline\u201d policy for the city after the riots of 1981, and when changes in shipping practices \u2013 the rise in the use of containers in particular \u2013 were having a devastating impact on a proud port. Deprivation and unemployment were widespread. But Hatton\u2019s response was to set an illegal budget \u2013 expenditure exceeding income \u2013 and to gamble that the government would make up the \u00a330m overspend. Other councils also affected by central government grant cuts managed to set legal budgets. The debt Hatton plunged Liverpool into was finally cleared 15 years later, in 2001. The interest rate paid over this time amounted to 57%. The Militant loans? They came from Swiss, Japanese and French banks. But Hatton\u2019s nadir came when he hired taxis to deliver redundancy notices to the council\u2019s 31,000 staff, on the basis that the council couldn\u2019t afford to pay them, as a \u201ctactic\u201d to extend negotiations of the Whitehall stalemate. Away from finances, Hatton appointed an unknown Londoner, Sam Bond, to the Liverpool Race Relations Liaison Committee over objections from the Black Caucus, at a time when racial tensions were especially high. Bond did not support affirmative action policies, and similarly, Militant did nothing for LGBT groups, given its opposition to policies that focused on particular oppressed groups. The neutral office of lord mayor, meanwhile, was abolished, to strengthen Militant\u2019s power. It is true that the council\u2019s Urban Regeneration Strategy managed a programme of house-building and delivered seven new sports centres. But the city facing bankruptcy meant schools were underfunded to the extent that they couldn\u2019t afford teachers, stationery or basic equipment or, in some cases, electricity and heating. Opposite my former school, there used to be Harthill Gardens, known as the \u201cKew Gardens of the north\u201d. When the gardeners were called out on strike, they rebelled, fearing the impact on the flora. In an act of political revenge, and a mark of his character, Hatton sacked the gardeners and bulldozed the gardens. A famous banner held aloft in protests against the council at the time read: \u201cHitler only destroyed half of our city. Hatton tried for the lot.\u201d Militant\u2019s grip on Liverpool came to an end with Neil Kinnock\u2019s famous speech at Labour\u2019s Bournemouth conference in 1985. Then party leader, Kinnock blasted Hatton\u2019s running of the council as \u201cgrotesque chaos\u201d. The NEC eventually voted 12 to six to expel Militant members. Hatton was put on trial on corruption charges, in response to Merseyside police\u2019s brilliantly named Operation Cheetah, though he was eventually acquitted. Liverpool\u2019s economy did not recover until the late 1990s. Get ready for this bit, if you don\u2019t know the story. In the time it takes for a costume change in a Beyonc\u00e9 show \u2013 ie about five seconds \u2013 the ostensibly socialist Hatton moved to tax-haven Cyprus to establish a property empire. (He already owned two buy-to-let flats in Liverpool). Even when deputy leader, Hatton was notorious for rolling around in a Jaguar and wearing obnoxious metallic suits. In a 2008 Telegraph interview he boasted about his \u00a360,000 Range Rover and \u201csix-figure bracket\u201d salary. Cyprus, he said, was great, because it (then) had a 10% tax rate (now 12.5%). As if this wholesale hypocrisy wasn\u2019t enough to turn the stomach, Hatton starred in a Sekonda \u201csolid gold\u201d watch advert. \u201cMy attitude has always been that you don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ve got in this world, so spend what you have while it\u2019s there,\u201d Hatton said. No shit. This is the man Labour has just readmitted to the party. A man who was literally cast as King Rat in a pantomime. In recent years, Hatton has even turned his hand to espousing ignorant ideas around rape cases, because he is committed to always becoming that bit worse. But it is perhaps most egregious that Berger\u2019s heartfelt statement on antisemitism has been met with Hatton\u2019s readmittance. Just a few years ago, Hatton tweeted about \u201cJews with any sense of humanity\u201d. The intellectual vacuity of antisemites, unable to distinguish between Netanyahu\u2019s government and past Israeli administrations and an entire group of historically oppressed people, or their right to a homeland, continues to take the breath away. It is a truly depressing thought, a morally vacant one. Stella Creasy has told Sky News that Hatton\u2019s return \u201cabsolutely beggars belief. I\u2019m not going to pretend otherwise\u201d. Lucy Powell has said the \u201ctiming could not be worse\u201d, while the former Welsh minister Alun Davies called the decision \u201cappalling. I do not want to be in the same party as this man\u201d. Neither do I. Whatever one thinks of the newly formed Independent Group \u2013 and it has always been my view that those who resign the whip, or cross the floor, should stand in byelections \u2013 Labour\u2019s reaction is dreadful. Referring to himself in the third person Hatton told Radio 4 this morning: \u201cI can assure you, Derek Hatton will not be the candidate for Wavertree,\u201d referring to Berger\u2019s constituency seat. But \u201cDegsy\u201d, the nickname he gave himself and had made into a numberplate (DEG5Y) is back espousing socialist values he disavowed. He\u2019s sucking up to Jeremy Corbyn, though two years ago he wrote that he had \u201cserious doubts about him\u201d. In response to a query about how his new capitalist lifestyle aligned with his apparent socialist beliefs \u2013 Hatton once said: \u201cMy days in politics were a very long time ago and I lost interest in it after I was expelled from the city council.\u201d The man doesn\u2019t have an honest bone in his body. I hope someone writes him a note telling him where to stick it, and delivers it in a taxi. Derek Twatton, indeed. \u2022 Hannah Jane Parkinson is a Guardian columnist \u2022 This article was amended on 20 February 2019 to correct the personalised numberplate; it was not DE5SY but was DEG5Y.",

But Saunders still raises big issues and, while apparently endorsing Mervyn\u2019s argument that art is \u201cthe most refined expression of neurosis\u201d, also shows that it is possible to wallow in romantic agony. The play leaves you debating whether it is better to be happy and well adjusted, as David and Helen seemingly are, or racked with memories of the past like the intense Mervyn and Anne. Tricia Thorns\u2019s production moves smoothly from domestic comedy to intellectual debate and Tim Welton perfectly catches the dual aspects of Mervyn: he is both a passionate champion of the inseparability of poetry and pain and a bit of a boozy charlatan. There is impeccable support from Annabel Mullion as his caustic wife, from Peter Prentice as the self-assured David and from Alix Dunmore, who subtly suggests that Helen is all too aware of the sense of loss that comes from curative therapy. \u2022 At Southwark Playhouse, London, until 9 March",

Dr Linda Ng Fat, lead author of the study, believes that an overall decline in drinking has made it more acceptable for young people to shun alcohol. \u201cIt seems that non-drinking is becoming more normative, which could make it easier for more and more young people not to drink, should they choose to.\u201d</p> <p>Eva Crossan Jory, vice president (welfare) of the NUS, says that while drinking is still strongly associated with university life, high levels of debt and the pressure to do well means that students are going out less. \u201cThe amount of debt means fewer [students] have the free time to go out,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have seen an increase in students working while doing their degrees, not just Saturday jobs but often near full-time work alongside study.\u201d</p> <p>Universities are keeping apace with this cultural shift.

      "bodyText": "It has been a familiar pattern of late: a carmaker announcing British job cuts, followed by days of back-and-forth as to exactly how much Brexit is to blame. Honda\u2019s announcement on Tuesday that it will close its Swindon plant followed the same course, with politicians on both sides lining up after the Japanese company insisted Brexit was not the reason for its decision. Amid the political wrangling, 7,000 people could lose their jobs. There are 3,500 jobs at risk in the factory itself, plus the same amount again at its suppliers. Whatever the reasoning of Honda, 2019 is already turning into an annus horribilis for the British car industry, which is largely dependent on exactly this sort of investment decision by foreign companies. Greg Clark, the business secretary and an ally of the prime minister in the cabinet, used the opportunity to renew his calls for MPs to pass the withdrawal agreement agreed between the government and the EU. Manufacturers are turning \u201cProject Fear\u201d into \u201cProject Reality\u201d, he added. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, also gave a glimpse of what is to come after Brexit for food tariffs under the fabled World Trade Organization. The answer: much the same. All of the Brexit wrangling comes against a backdrop of a British economy which may be struggling with uncertainty, but is still breaking records. Tuesday\u2019s labour market data showed unemployment remained at a four-decade low in December, while wage growth (excluding bonuses) remained at 3.4%, above inflation. Thanks for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. JJ The S&amp;P 500 lost 7.5 points, or 0.3%, at the opening bell, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped by 44 points, or 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell by 20 points, or 0.3%. Investors are focused on the latest round of trade talks between the US and China. Hopes that the two countries will hammer out a deal to end their protracted trade war helped the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq log their best week in a month on Friday. Both sides have said progress has been made, but few details have emerged from the talks so far. Trade negotiations are set to take place in Washington later in the day and will be followed by higher-level talks on Thursday. The fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld has died aged 85, his Chanel label has said. He is credited with reinventing Chanel, taking it from a small house to an industry leader. In 2017 the privately owned company released financial figures for the first time, revealing it had made \u00a31.35bn the previous year. US stock markets are expected to dip on the first day back from a long weekend to mark Presidents Day. Futures for the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index have fallen by 0.3% ahead of the open on Wall Street. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by slightly less than 0.3%. US markets may be helped by Walmart, after the retailer beat profit expectations in the final three months of the year. Sales at stores rose by 4.2% at its US stores, after a 3.4% increase in the third quarter. The strong numbers from the world\u2019s largest retailer are especially encouraging after a very weak December retail sales report last week from the US Commerce Department led many to fear that consumers had gone into hiding. Greg Clark, the business secretary, is facing questions in the House of Commons. Clark said that the Japanese ambassador to the UK has written to the UK and the EU saying that companies cannot cope with a situation in which companies can \u201conly [grasp] the whole picture at the last minute\u201d. \u201cI think that is a piece of advice we should heed,\u201d Clark said, calling for MPs to vote through a deal as soon as possible. \u201cPolitical uncertainty over a no-deal Brexit, or what kind of Brexit, casts a shadow over our future,\u201d he added. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clark said the business leaders to whom he has spoken have a \u201cvirtually unanimous view that the deal is one that meets their needs\u201d. Something else for you to chew on this lunchtime: the vegan sausage roll has boosted sales at Greggs, the biggest baker in the UK. Greggs has upgraded profit expectations for the third time in three months, crediting the publicity around its vegan sausage rolls for a surge in sales, writes Sarah Butler. The UK\u2019s biggest bakery chain said it had made \u201can exceptionally strong start to 2019\u201d with sales at established stores up 9.6% in the seven weeks to 16 February. Prime Minister Theresa May has spoken to the president of Honda to express her disappointment about its closure of its Swindon factory, according to her spokesman. She told the cabinet that the government will do all it can to support Honda employees. And she noted that Honda will retain its European headquarters in the UK, which will continue to manage its sales across Britain and the EU. At lunchtime in London stock markets have eased further. The FTSE 100 is the second worst performer of the major European indices, down by 0.6%. Germany\u2019s Dax index has outperformed the rest of Europe, after the influential Zew economic sentiment index came in slightly higher than expected. Greg Clark has acknowledged that getting a Brexit deal as soon as possible is a priority for business. Leaving without a deal would threaten companies which export to more distant markets, he said. Some trade deals which the EU currently has with nations such as Japan and South Korea will not be applied to the UK before Brexit. Clark has been one of the most prominent voices in Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s cabinet in favour of the withdrawal agreement the government reached with the EU. However, the deal still faces significant opposition from a majority in Parliament, led by backbench Conservatives who want a no-deal Brexit to remain part of the government\u2019s negotiating strategy. The business secretary, Greg Clark, has said that Honda\u2019s decision to close its Swindon plant shows how much is at stake for British industry ahead of Brexit. While Honda insisted that Brexit was not to blame for the closure, Clark made it clear that he regards a no-deal Brexit as unacceptable for UK firms. Manufacturers\u2019 warnings on customs delays and tariffs are \u201cProject Reality\u201d, Clark said \u2013 a reference to the \u201cProject Fear\u201d moniker used by Brexit-backing politicians to describe predictions of chaos if there is no deal. Clark was speaking in London at the conference of Make UK \u2013 the manufacturing lobby group which today ditched its previous name, the EEF. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has today revealed that the UK will apply tariffs on food imports, in a concession to farmers who had feared their industry could be overwhelmed by cheap food from abroad. There had been reports at the weekend of zero tariff rates on food \u2013 a policy being pushed by some of the economists who backed leaving the EU. However, Gove said these were \u201cnot accurate\u201d, in a speech at the National Farmers\u2019 Union conference in Birmingham. Read more from the Guardian\u2019s Lisa O\u2019Carroll on the politics live blog here. The Office for National Statistics also published productivity numbers this morning, which showed that output per hour worked rose 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the last three months of 2018. Productivity had previously fallen by 0.4% in the third quarter. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor at EY ITEM Club, said the lack of a bounceback from a \u201cmarked relapse in the third quarter\u201d was \u201cpretty disappointing news\u201d. Part of the UK\u2019s recent poor labour productivity performance has undoubtedly been that low wage growth has increased the attractiveness of employment for companies. It is also highly probable that several companies have preferred to take on labour rather than commit to costly investment, given a highly uncertain economic and political outlook, magnified by Brexit since mid-2016. The low cost of labour relative to capital has certainly supported employment over investment. Alpesh Paleja, a principal economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said continued weak productivity growth poses a \u201crisk to the sustainability of the recovery in pay going forward\u201d. Some reaction to the labour market numbers earlier this morning, which showed that unemployment remains low, and wage growth continued: The figures may represent a peak for the British labour market, according to Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at Capital Economics \u2013 although he still believes the Bank of England will raise interest rates faster than markets currently expect. He said: While reassuring, the large rise in employment in the fourth quarter probably marks a peak in employment growth given the deterioration in surveys of hiring in January. And pay growth plateaued. Tom Hadley, director of policy at the Recruitment &amp; Employment Confederation, said the figures show \u201cthe resilience of the UK jobs market, with record vacancies and numbers of people in work\u201d. However, he also noted the significant downturn in businesses confidence in the UK economy which is impacting on future hiring intentions in surveys. There is a real fear, as we are seeing in the UK manufacturing industry, that we will see lower growth and fewer opportunities in the future. Having confirmed that its Swindon plant is to close, Honda now appears to be saying that the number of job losses could reach 7,000, double what was expected, report the Guardian\u2019s Rob Davies and Julia Kollewe. That\u2019s because it is consulting with subsidiaries and partners in the supply chain serving the Swindon plant, meaning a further 3,500 jobs could go. Meanwhile, the company is insisting that its decision is not down to Brexit, but automotive analysts aren\u2019t buying it. There may be other important factors, they say, but it\u2019s impossible to remove Brexit from the equation. \u201cThey\u2019re probably trying to be polite publicly,\u201d said Professor David Bailey of Aston University. The Labour party\u2019s shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long Bailey, blamed the government\u2019s austerity programme for Honda\u2019s decision. She said it was \u201cdevastating news, first and foremost for Honda employees and their families, but also for the jobs across the supply chain and the impact on the local economy in Swindon\u201d This government has failed to create an environment of business confidence. The Tories\u2019 austerity programme has failed workers and businesses, and they continue to show a total lack of vision or plans for investment in our future. With Honda saying Brexit was not a factor, this Tory government shoulders yet more responsibility for failing to create an environment of business confidence. Businesses have lost faith in the government\u2019s austerity programme and total lack of vision or investment for our future. The car industry\u2019s lobby group reacts to the \u201cdevastating\u201d Honda announcement. While the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has not commented directly on Honda\u2019s reasoning, it\u2019s clear that Brexit is still on the industry\u2019s mind. Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a huge blow to UK automotive manufacturing, and for the Honda plant\u2019s highly skilled and productive workforce. Whilst production will continue in Swindon until 2021, giving government and industry time to help affected employees and the local supply chain, which supports a further 10,000 jobs, this is, nevertheless, devastating news. The challenges facing Honda are not unique. The global automotive industry is facing fundamental changes: technological, commercial and environmental, as well as escalating trade tensions, and all manufacturers are facing difficult decisions. The UK should be at the forefront of these changes, championing its competitiveness and innovation, rather than having to focus resources on the need to avoid a catastrophic \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit. In mid-morning trading the FTSE 100 has slightly extended its losses, with HSBC and Standard Chartered still the biggest fallers. It\u2019s a sea of red across European stock markets this morning, so the 0.4% fall seen by London\u2019s blue-chip equities is not out of line. Germany\u2019s Dax has endured the smallest fall. Unite also has a view on the political side. The union has been highly critical of the government\u2019s approach to Brexit negotiations. Des Quinn said: \u201cWhile Brexit is not mentioned by the company as a reason for the announcement, we believe that the uncertainty that the Tory government has created by its inept and rigid handling of the Brexit negotiations lurks in the background. If the government had delivered a strong and stable Brexit that protected the economy and jobs, we may well have been in a very different position today. Honda staff have been sent home for the day after receiving the bad news this morning. While the plans technically remain under consultation, it is all but certain that the 3,500 workers will be made redundant gradually as the factory shuts down in 2021. Unite is not giving up on the plant, which has received millions of pounds of investment from the Japanese carmaker, most recently to make it the global production hub for its 10th generation Civic. The union\u2019s national officer for the automotive sector, Des Quinn, said: \u201cWe acknowledge the global challenges that Honda has outlined in its statement, but we don\u2019t accept that this plant, with its highly skilled and dedicated workforce, does not have a viable future. We are now entering a period of meaningful consultations with the management to examine in detail the business case put forward by the company. We will leave no stone unturned to keep this plant going and its workforce in employment. The pressure on real wages has been one of the defining features of the British economy in the last decade, but the decline in inflation in recent months has given some relief to workers. The government will hope that the pick-up in real wages is sustained. Here\u2019s a useful chart from the Office for National Statistics showing what the British worker has been through in the past two decades. Note the pick-up in the past year in real pay \u2013 after the devaluation of sterling following the EU referendum in 2016 boosted inflation and dented real wages. Sterling remains unmoved in the immediate aftermath of the labour market data, down by less than 0.1% against the US dollar at $1.2918. The headline figures are mostly in line with economists\u2019 expectations, confirming the picture of a British economy with high employment and something of an acceleration in real wage growth. The employment rate \u2013 the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 in work \u2013 came in at 75.8%, higher than for a year earlier (75.2%) and the joint-highest since comparable estimates began in 1971. Regular pay in nominal terms increased by 3.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics, slightly lower than the 3.5% growth expected by economists but still above inflation. Unemployment remained at 4%, a four-decade low. Whatever Honda\u2019s reasons for deciding to close Swindon, the UK car industry clearly feels threatened by a possible no-deal Brexit. The sector made more than 1.5m cars last year, but the industry body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, revealed that investment by manufacturers almost halved in 2018 to \u00a3588.6m. Take a look here for what carmakers across the UK have done to prepare for Brexit, including Jaguar Land Rover, Nissan, Ford and BMW: The mood in Swindon is grim, with the prospect of the loss of 3,500 high-quality manufacturing jobs \u2013 with knock-on effects across the town\u2019s economy. The Wiltshire town, with a population of around 220,000, has been relatively insulated from unemployment in recent years, writes the Guardian\u2019s Amy Walker. Alan Tomala, regional officer for the Unite union who worked at the plant between 1995 and 2007, said workers were \u201cangry, dismayed and worried\u201d. Here\u2019s the full Honda report from the Guardian\u2019s Julia Kollewe, who notes that the Japanese carmaker\u2019s decision is only the latest in a long line of bad news for the British car industry. However, senior Brexit-backing MP Steve Baker has seized on Ian Howell\u2019s comments that the move towards electrification was the only factor in the closure. Baker, a former minister in the Department for Exiting the EU, is an influential member of the European Research Group. The backbench group has pressured prime minister Theresa May towards trading with the EU on World Trade Organization terms after 29 March, rather than having a withdrawal period. Back on Honda, the political fallout from the closure of the Swindon plant is only just beginning. Pro-EU politicians have disregarded Honda\u2019s assertion that Brexit is not the main reason for its decision. David Lammy, the Labour MP, said the decision was \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said it was \u201cridiculous\u201d to claim it was not Brexit-related. On the FTSE 100, HSBC is the biggest faller, down by 3.3% in early trading after it delivered disappointing profit numbers this morning. Higher costs and stock market falls chipped away at its trading businesses, while it also warned that an economic slowdown in China and the UK would throw up further hurdles this year. Chief executive John Flint, rounding off his first year at the helm of the company, said the bank may have to scale back investment plans in order to avoid missing a key target to grow revenues faster than costs for a second straight year. HSBC\u2019s performance dragged down fellow emerging markets-focused bank Standard Chartered by 2.9%. The FTSE 100 is down by 0.4%, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 has lost 0.2%. Honda said it will focus its future manufacturing activity in regions where it expects high production volumes, in a statement published this morning. Katsushi Inoue, Honda\u2019s chief officer for European regional operations, said: In light of the unprecedented changes that are affecting our industry, it is vital that we accelerate our electrification strategy and restructure our global operations accordingly. As a result, we have had to take this difficult decision to consult our workforce on how we might prepare our manufacturing network for the future. This has not been taken lightly and we deeply regret how unsettling today\u2019s announcement will be for our people. Swindon, which was unveiled as the global production hub for the Civic only in 2017, makes 150,000 cars every year \u2013 one every 69 seconds. Yet its \u201ccurrent role as a global manufacturing hub may no longer be viable\u201d, Honda said. Carmakers generally have a five- to seven-year investment cycle for production of each model, but Howells said the decision on what to do in Swindon had \u201ccollided with this change to electrification\u201d. Staff will now have a consultation over their future. The company will offer a \u201cwhole raft of support services\u201d to employees who lose their jobs, Howells said. He added: Clearly it\u2019s a very sad day for us. Honda insists the decision to close the Swindon plant is not related to Brexit, but rather the need to target its largest markets as the car industry rapidly moves towards electrification. Ian Howells, the senior vice president at Honda Motor Europe, said the industry is facing \u201cunprecedented change in the industry\u201d on a \u201cglobal scale\u201d, in an interview on BBC radio. This is not a Brexit-related issue for us. This decision has been made on the basis of the global issues. \u201cWe\u2019re having to look very closely at where we\u2019re putting investment,\u201d he said. Honda\u2019s main markets are in the US, China and Japan. Greg Clark, the government\u2019s business secretary, said Honda\u2019s decision was a \u201ccommercial decision based on unprecedented changes in the global market\u201d. It is \u201ca devastating decision for Swindon and the UK\u201d, he said. This news is a particularly bitter blow to the thousands of skilled and dedicated staff who work at the factory, their families and all of those employed in the supply chain. I will convene a taskforce in Swindon with local MPs, civic and business leaders as well as trade union representatives to ensure that the skills and expertise of the workforce is retained, and these highly valued employees move into new skilled employment. The decision is also a blow coming after recent government investments in battery technology \u2013 although Honda has not been a direct recipient of state aid, unlike Nissan and other carmakers. Clark said: The automotive industry is undergoing a rapid transition to new technology. The UK is one of the leaders in the development of these technologies and so it is deeply disappointing that this decision has been taken now. Japanese carmaker Honda will end production in Swindon in 2021. The factory employs 3,500 people. Even amid the political turmoil, European stock markets are expected to open flat this morning. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 edged down yesterday by 0.24%, after a week of gains. Metro points out North Swindon Conservative MP Justin Tomlinson\u2019s comments that Brexit is not to blame for the closure, after he spoke to Honda and essentially confirmed the plans yesterday. Tomlinson made it clear he believed the decision was driven by \u201cglobal trends and not Brexit\u201d and a retrenchment of the carmaker in its Japanese home market. Tomlinson campaigned in favour of leaving the EU. The news of Honda\u2019s likely announcement dominated the business pages this morning \u2013 even if the defection of seven Labour MPs to a new independent group drove the day on the front pages. The Financial Times used the Honda story to highlight just how close we are to the planned date of Brexit on 29 March, and how a fresh trade deal between the EU and Japan may have tipped the balance away from the UK. The Guardian\u2019s front page story on Honda highlights the effect on jobs, with 3,500 Honda employees who could lose their roles. Unions described it as a \u201cshattering body blow\u201d. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The struggles of the British car industry in the past two years have been well documented, and today we are expecting confirmation of the latest blow: the exit of Honda manufacturing from the UK. An announcement on the future of Honda\u2019s Swindon plant is expected this morning after the company has informed its employees. If confirmed, it would put about 3,500 jobs at risk \u2013 as well as symbolising the decline of one of British manufacturing\u2019s success stories. The car industry across the world is struggling with a slowdown in the Chinese economy as well as a political and regulatory backlash against pollution from diesel vehicles in Europe. However, Brexit fears \u2013 which have been blamed for stalling investment \u2013 have also stalked the industry. Honda, alongside other Japanese manufacturers Nissan and Toyota, was attracted to the UK in the 1980s by the Thatcher government with the promise of easy access to European markets. The departure of Honda so soon after Nissan u-turned on a decision to build its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland presents another blow to the current government. After a quieter start to the week on the economics front, this morning sees the latest update on the British jobs market, with unemployment and wage growth figures due from the Office for National Statistics. No change is expected in the overall unemployment rate, which remained at four-decade lows at 4% in November. However, annual wage growth is expected to tick up to 3.4% in December, which would represent some positive news for the British people amid considerable economic uncertainty.

      "body": "<p>The designer Karl Lagerfeld, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/feb/19/karl-lagerfeld-fashion-designer-dies-aged-85\">who has died aged 85</a>, explored and exploited couture, ready-to-wear and even mass-market fashion for more than 60 years. He had a genius for visual quotation and allusion, impersonation and pastiche, especially at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2016/may/16/pearls-berets-supermodels-chanel-karl-lagerfeld-book\" title=\"\">Chanel</a>, the fashion house he headed for more than three decades, and it made him the first postmodern fashionmeister.</p> \n<p>Nobody else stayed on top of so many labels for so long: besides Chanel, Lagerfeld headed <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/12/a-fashionable-friendship-karl-lagerfeld-on-his-long-lasting-collaboration-with-fendi.html\" title=\"\">Fendi</a>, and intermittently had his own-name brand. And he evolved into a commentary on the whole business: personally stylised into his own logo (glasses, gloves, the defensive composure for the camera); encyclopedic about the history of design, yet devoid of sentimental nostalgia. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0003838/\" title=\"\">Edna E Mode</a>, the opinionated couturier in the Pixar cartoon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/nov/19/the-incredibles-film-review\" title=\"\">The Incredibles</a>, says: \u201cI never look back, darling, it distracts from the now.\u201d Totally Lagerfeld.</p> \n<p>Lagerfeld\u2019s first imaginative creation had been himself. His version set his birth at variable dates on a country estate in Schleswig-Holstein in Germany, his papa Otto possessed of a fortune from condensed milk, and mama Elisabeth (nee Bahlmann) a woman of culture.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"240e5a9e4b7f7bd8c310e015c3f2498df06e70dc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/240e5a9e4b7f7bd8c310e015c3f2498df06e70dc/0_213_3397_2038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karl Lagerfeld at work for Jean Patou in the 1960s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karl Lagerfeld at work for Jean Patou in the 1960s.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gamma-Keystone/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He told of his strict upbringing, governess, and the family\u2019s oil painting of the court of Frederick the Great. However, German records set the date earlier at 1933, downgrade his father to a successful businessman, his mother to a lingerie saleswoman and the schloss to a manse in the leafy suburban Baurs Park district of Hamburg, from which the family was evicted by British occupation forces. He later dropped the final letter of Lagerfeldt to arrive at a more marketable name.</p> \n<p>Witnesses remembered a longhaired outsider determined to be far from the hungry postwar countryside or grim Hamburg. In both versions, he was an autodidact who made bold connections between visual aspects of the zeitgeist.</p> \n<p>That was his genuine gift: he combined a historian\u2019s knowledge of the past with a diarist\u2019s curiosity about the present, and subjected them to the ruthlessness that ruled his life. Anything and anybody was abandoned as soon as he considered the present should turn to past. He called it \u201c<a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/books/yves-of-destruction-1-1142820\" title=\"\">vampirising</a>\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0c79fad03097222f54b4a1a93baf26663e6e545\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0c79fad03097222f54b4a1a93baf26663e6e545/0_78_3585_2151/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karl Lagerfeld with the Golden Spinning Wheel, which he won in 1973.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karl Lagerfeld with the Golden Spinning Wheel, which he won in 1973.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bertram/DPA/PA Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After private school and a spell, at his request, at the Lyc\u00e9e Montaigne in Paris, Lagerfeld won in the coat category of the 1954 <a href=\"http://www.woolmark.com/woolmark-prize/\" title=\"\">International Wool Secretariat competition</a>, and was invited as apprentice to Pierre Balmain\u2019s couture house. After that he joined Jean Patou, where he designed under the name Roland Karl; there was enough family money to pay for a Mercedes and a social life.</p> \n<p>He left in 1962 to work as a designer for upmarket ready-to-wear firms that had begun to serve customers for whom couture was too expensive and dressmakers too dowdy. Lagerfeld collected books, a copy to shelve plus another to gut for images, while observing the current mood on the streets. His designs were commercial, and his workrate exceptional \u2013 ideas in, sketches out, all of it thrown away immediately on completion, for Krizia, Ballantyne, Isetan, <a href=\"http://www.charles-jourdan.com/\" title=\"\">Charles Jourdan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/12/31/tiziani-archive-of-sketch_n_4523641.html\" title=\"\">Tiziani of Rome</a> and many other quality firms.</p> \n<p>In 1967 he took over furs for the Italian firm Fendi, and did things with pelts none had dared before. For the dreamy frock company Chlo\u00e9, which had recruited him in 1963, he used his understanding of old dressmaking details. Flea market vintage, bought decades before retro was chic, and his collector\u2019s familiarity with art deco, set the house style; his 1972 deco ready-to-wear collection attracted more attention than most couture shows, although Lagerfeld\u2019s relationship with Chlo\u00e9 and the other employers remained discreet. He didn\u2019t take bows.</p> \n<p>The fees they paid, plus the extra Lagerfeld accumulated through using his antennae to deal in antiques and art, funded his high visibility: attention was paid to his appearance, possessions and the premises he stashed them in. Andy Warhol borrowed a Lagerfeld apartment as the venue for a movie, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0210793/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" title=\"\">L\u2019Amour</a> (1973), and Lagerfeld adopted Warhol\u2019s creed of superficiality, although behind that facade lay a wide and deep consumption of art and literature. Lagerfeld and the Puerto Rican fashion illustrator <a href=\"http://www.wmagazine.com/story/antonio-lopez-fashion-illustrator\" title=\"\">Antonio Lopez</a> had a Parisian salon, in the arts not fashion sense, early in the70s.</p> \n<p>Along with Warhol, Lopez introduced Lagerfeld to American pop culture and its idea of fashion based on attitude more than actual garments. Lopez and Lagerfeld drew competitively. They snapped Instamatics. They assembled collages, prototypes of the mood boards that began to dominate collections as fashion expanded its markets in the 1970s.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cbd29b5a4f6c7911807fb28920e075d9fcf852a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cbd29b5a4f6c7911807fb28920e075d9fcf852a/40_294_4976_2986/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carole Bouquet, the French actor, left, with the model In\u00e8s de La Fressange and Karl Lagerfeld attending the spring-summer ready-to-wear fashion show in Paris in 1986.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carole Bouquet, the French actor, left, with the model In\u00e8s de La Fressange and Karl Lagerfeld attending the spring-summer ready-to-wear fashion show in Paris in 1986.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pierre Verdy/Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Lopez and his circle were bankrolled by Lagerfeld, who paid for clothes and presents \u2013 Lagerfeld gave, without stint, personally chosen gifts to favourites and as business offerings. A Chlo\u00e9 perfume in 1975 increased his income and his flamboyance flared, but his famous fan, tied-back hair and wild garments never impeded the flow of reliably saleable designs for clients. Lagerfeld was the German industrial miracle.</p> \n<p>His longterm bet that ready-to-wear would prevail surprisingly brought him in 1982 to the couture house of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Coco-Chanel\" title=\"\">Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel</a>, who had died in 1971. The first show, in 1983, was not a critical success, although his pastiches of Coco\u2019s classics were passable and his learning about his predecessor unsurpassed: \u201cI\u2019m like a computer who\u2019s plugged into the Chanel mode,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>By the second collection he had deconstructed her lifework into a mood board \u2013 tweeds, braids, quilted bags, costume jewellery and the double C logo \u2013 and played outrageous games with them. To those who hated his mockery of Chanel\u2019s practical clothes, he replied the house had been \u201ca sleeping beauty who snored\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"72d2d93e-072d-48c4-ad5a-4b0c6489ad99\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(September 10, 1933)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Birth</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Karl Otto Lagerfeld was born (it\u2019s thought) on this day in Hamburg to Otto, a businessman who imported evaporated milk, and Elizabeth, a lingerie salesperson, although his true age remains a mystery to this day.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 1, 1940)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Education</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Expressing an interest in fashion and art from a young age, Lagerfeld went to a private school in Germany before attending&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Montaigne_(Paris)\">Lyc\u00e9e Montaigne</a>, a secondary school in Paris, where he majored in history and art.

His dresses, inspired by the shape of the letter \u201cK\u201d for Karl, were met with boos from the press.

Others had preceded him in staging shows as rock gigs and recouping the money on perfumes and licensing deals; but Lagerfeld envisaged Chanel as an intercontinental superbrand, big beyond even the perspicacity of its then owner Alain Wertheimer, who paid up when Lagerfeld demanded $1m per collection.</p> \n<p>Other houses hired their own necromancers \u2013 as the writer and former editor of French Vogue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/may/27/fashion.features3\" title=\"\">Joan Juliet Buck</a> wrote, Lagerfeld \u201cstarted the Lazarus movement\u201d. He did it best, and his ideas channelled through Chanel influenced everybody, especially his 90s tweeds simulated in extra-light fabrics, and unravelled seams and hems.</p> \n<p>As soon as he was lord of Chanel, Lagerfeld abandoned Chlo\u00e9 (he was enticed to return in the 90s) and was backed by the American Bidermann Industries to produce ready-to-wear under his own name: this line lingered until bankruptcy in 1997. He bought back his name for a franc, relaunched and, in 2004, sold his trademarks to Tommy Hilfiger, hiring himself out to design for them. He used his other talents, as a photographer (for Chanel campaigns, magazines, galleries), and as publisher of the imprint Edition 7L, which brought out books that had caught his attention.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0aadf4a5523f7096bbea60c38cbf178775f8308\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0aadf4a5523f7096bbea60c38cbf178775f8308/0_18_2690_1614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karl Lagerfeld leading models on the catwalk at the end of the autumn/winter ready-to-wear Chanel collection in Paris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karl Lagerfeld leading models on the catwalk at the end of the autumn/winter ready-to-wear Chanel collection in Paris.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Platiau/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Edition 7L\u2019s bestseller was The Karl Lagerfeld Diet (2002), triggered by his 40kg weight loss: he had denied himself Coca-Cola, cheese and chocolate cake to emerge from the black tent garb of his more corpulent era and wear the slimmest Dior. He dropped the fan, although the dark glasses remained, as did the fingerless gloves to hide the mechanic\u2019s hands of which he was ashamed, because his mother had loathed them.</p> \n<p>This changed appearance became his logo: when in 2004 he took the logical step of designing a collection for the high-street chain H&amp;M, billboards of his slender persona sold the goods. He was suddenly a celebrity, and the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/inside-the-world-of-karl-lagerfeld-399489.html\" title=\"\">Brazilian government had to warn him it could not afford to provide security for a visit</a>. That his marionette self (there were Steiff bears in his image, and a toy mouse) now signified more than all the effort of his lifetime invention seems to have been his choice.</p> \n<p>There was nowhere to go but back to work in the present, as he had always feared not being part of the moment as a death in itself. So he was soon into social media as each novelty arrived: his Birman cat, Choupette, had her own Twitter and Instagram accounts, professionally updated.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5137f5cb67f7a6a95a7d7cfa80a58b59baf9a5c9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5137f5cb67f7a6a95a7d7cfa80a58b59baf9a5c9/0_0_2000_3000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Karl Lagerfeld and Lily Allen in 2014.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karl Lagerfeld and Lily Allen in 2014.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet, with Chanel company money, he secured the future of six ancient Parisian craft workshops and designed extra, beautiful, collections to show off their slow handiwork.

He bought and sold the Ch\u00e2teau de Penho\u00ebt in Brittany, and a mansion near his childhood home (also sold, the landscape not being as he imagined it).</p> \n<p>Much of his antique collection was auctioned for more room and fewer memories, then he began to acquire again. Among the celebrated collaborators he repudiated were Lopez, his muses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/aug/10/anna-piaggi\" title=\"\">Anna Piaggi</a> and Paloma Picasso, In\u00e8s de La Fressange (for posing as official model for the French symbol <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne\" title=\"\">Marianne</a> while under contract to Chanel), and the later house deity Claudia Schiffer. \u201cThe curtain falls,\u201d he said of his curtailment of friendships. \u201cAn iron curtain.\u201d He could be publicly dismissive of strangers, too, especially the looks and figures of non-ethereal women.</p> \n<p>Lagerfeld had adored Jacques de Bascher, a provincial fantasist who projected himself as an elegant aristo, and subsidised De Bascher to do the risky living for him, the drugs and sex Lagerfeld held back from. As Buck said: \u201cHe could look at Jacques\u2019 excesses from above, in a princely fashion; he himself was too grand.\u201d After De Bascher\u2019s death from Aids in 1989, Lagerfeld mourned him publicly but decreed the official line should be that he had never fallen in love: \u201cI am just in love with my job.\u201d</p> \n<p>A court dismissed <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/11/style/11iht-fkarl.3860665.html\" title=\"\">Lagerfeld\u2019s suit</a> for invasion of privacy against Alicia Drake, after the most telling chapter of her fashion memoir, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49098.The_Beautiful_Fall\" title=\"\">The Beautiful Fall</a> (2006), described the suicide near Penho\u00ebt of a member of Lagerfeld\u2019s entourage, which barely paused the posing and sketching at the ch\u00e2teau.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m floating.

      "bodyText": "The designer Karl Lagerfeld, who has died aged 85, explored and exploited couture, ready-to-wear and even mass-market fashion for more than 60 years. He had a genius for visual quotation and allusion, impersonation and pastiche, especially at Chanel, the fashion house he headed for more than three decades, and it made him the first postmodern fashionmeister. Nobody else stayed on top of so many labels for so long: besides Chanel, Lagerfeld headed Fendi, and intermittently had his own-name brand. And he evolved into a commentary on the whole business: personally stylised into his own logo (glasses, gloves, the defensive composure for the camera); encyclopedic about the history of design, yet devoid of sentimental nostalgia. Edna E Mode, the opinionated couturier in the Pixar cartoon The Incredibles, says: \u201cI never look back, darling, it distracts from the now.\u201d Totally Lagerfeld. Lagerfeld\u2019s first imaginative creation had been himself. His version set his birth at variable dates on a country estate in Schleswig-Holstein in Germany, his papa Otto possessed of a fortune from condensed milk, and mama Elisabeth (nee Bahlmann) a woman of culture. He told of his strict upbringing, governess, and the family\u2019s oil painting of the court of Frederick the Great. However, German records set the date earlier at 1933, downgrade his father to a successful businessman, his mother to a lingerie saleswoman and the schloss to a manse in the leafy suburban Baurs Park district of Hamburg, from which the family was evicted by British occupation forces. He later dropped the final letter of Lagerfeldt to arrive at a more marketable name. Witnesses remembered a longhaired outsider determined to be far from the hungry postwar countryside or grim Hamburg. In both versions, he was an autodidact who made bold connections between visual aspects of the zeitgeist. That was his genuine gift: he combined a historian\u2019s knowledge of the past with a diarist\u2019s curiosity about the present, and subjected them to the ruthlessness that ruled his life. Anything and anybody was abandoned as soon as he considered the present should turn to past. He called it \u201cvampirising\u201d. After private school and a spell, at his request, at the Lyc\u00e9e Montaigne in Paris, Lagerfeld won in the coat category of the 1954 International Wool Secretariat competition, and was invited as apprentice to Pierre Balmain\u2019s couture house. After that he joined Jean Patou, where he designed under the name Roland Karl; there was enough family money to pay for a Mercedes and a social life. He left in 1962 to work as a designer for upmarket ready-to-wear firms that had begun to serve customers for whom couture was too expensive and dressmakers too dowdy. Lagerfeld collected books, a copy to shelve plus another to gut for images, while observing the current mood on the streets. His designs were commercial, and his workrate exceptional \u2013 ideas in, sketches out, all of it thrown away immediately on completion, for Krizia, Ballantyne, Isetan, Charles Jourdan, Tiziani of Rome and many other quality firms. In 1967 he took over furs for the Italian firm Fendi, and did things with pelts none had dared before. For the dreamy frock company Chlo\u00e9, which had recruited him in 1963, he used his understanding of old dressmaking details. Flea market vintage, bought decades before retro was chic, and his collector\u2019s familiarity with art deco, set the house style; his 1972 deco ready-to-wear collection attracted more attention than most couture shows, although Lagerfeld\u2019s relationship with Chlo\u00e9 and the other employers remained discreet. He didn\u2019t take bows. The fees they paid, plus the extra Lagerfeld accumulated through using his antennae to deal in antiques and art, funded his high visibility: attention was paid to his appearance, possessions and the premises he stashed them in. Andy Warhol borrowed a Lagerfeld apartment as the venue for a movie, L\u2019Amour (1973), and Lagerfeld adopted Warhol\u2019s creed of superficiality, although behind that facade lay a wide and deep consumption of art and literature. Lagerfeld and the Puerto Rican fashion illustrator Antonio Lopez had a Parisian salon, in the arts not fashion sense, early in the70s. Along with Warhol, Lopez introduced Lagerfeld to American pop culture and its idea of fashion based on attitude more than actual garments. Lopez and Lagerfeld drew competitively. They snapped Instamatics. They assembled collages, prototypes of the mood boards that began to dominate collections as fashion expanded its markets in the 1970s. Lopez and his circle were bankrolled by Lagerfeld, who paid for clothes and presents \u2013 Lagerfeld gave, without stint, personally chosen gifts to favourites and as business offerings. A Chlo\u00e9 perfume in 1975 increased his income and his flamboyance flared, but his famous fan, tied-back hair and wild garments never impeded the flow of reliably saleable designs for clients. Lagerfeld was the German industrial miracle. His longterm bet that ready-to-wear would prevail surprisingly brought him in 1982 to the couture house of Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel, who had died in 1971. The first show, in 1983, was not a critical success, although his pastiches of Coco\u2019s classics were passable and his learning about his predecessor unsurpassed: \u201cI\u2019m like a computer who\u2019s plugged into the Chanel mode,\u201d he said. By the second collection he had deconstructed her lifework into a mood board \u2013 tweeds, braids, quilted bags, costume jewellery and the double C logo \u2013 and played outrageous games with them. To those who hated his mockery of Chanel\u2019s practical clothes, he replied the house had been \u201ca sleeping beauty who snored\u201d. He was even more radical in understanding the globalisation of luxury in the 80s. Others had preceded him in staging shows as rock gigs and recouping the money on perfumes and licensing deals; but Lagerfeld envisaged Chanel as an intercontinental superbrand, big beyond even the perspicacity of its then owner Alain Wertheimer, who paid up when Lagerfeld demanded $1m per collection. Other houses hired their own necromancers \u2013 as the writer and former editor of French Vogue Joan Juliet Buck wrote, Lagerfeld \u201cstarted the Lazarus movement\u201d. He did it best, and his ideas channelled through Chanel influenced everybody, especially his 90s tweeds simulated in extra-light fabrics, and unravelled seams and hems. As soon as he was lord of Chanel, Lagerfeld abandoned Chlo\u00e9 (he was enticed to return in the 90s) and was backed by the American Bidermann Industries to produce ready-to-wear under his own name: this line lingered until bankruptcy in 1997. He bought back his name for a franc, relaunched and, in 2004, sold his trademarks to Tommy Hilfiger, hiring himself out to design for them. He used his other talents, as a photographer (for Chanel campaigns, magazines, galleries), and as publisher of the imprint Edition 7L, which brought out books that had caught his attention. Edition 7L\u2019s bestseller was The Karl Lagerfeld Diet (2002), triggered by his 40kg weight loss: he had denied himself Coca-Cola, cheese and chocolate cake to emerge from the black tent garb of his more corpulent era and wear the slimmest Dior. He dropped the fan, although the dark glasses remained, as did the fingerless gloves to hide the mechanic\u2019s hands of which he was ashamed, because his mother had loathed them. This changed appearance became his logo: when in 2004 he took the logical step of designing a collection for the high-street chain H&amp;M, billboards of his slender persona sold the goods. He was suddenly a celebrity, and the Brazilian government had to warn him it could not afford to provide security for a visit. That his marionette self (there were Steiff bears in his image, and a toy mouse) now signified more than all the effort of his lifetime invention seems to have been his choice. There was nowhere to go but back to work in the present, as he had always feared not being part of the moment as a death in itself. So he was soon into social media as each novelty arrived: his Birman cat, Choupette, had her own Twitter and Instagram accounts, professionally updated. Yet, with Chanel company money, he secured the future of six ancient Parisian craft workshops and designed extra, beautiful, collections to show off their slow handiwork. The newest, global nouveaux riches \u2013 \u201crich as air\u201d he said, not kindly \u2013 failed to impress him, even if his couture shows expanded into spectacles more operatic than his 1980 designs for Berlioz\u2019s Les Troyens at La Scala, Milan. Last December the backdrop was an Egyptian temple in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, but he did not appear at the January show in Paris. Lagerfeld owned a sequence of Parisian apartments, including a large chunk of an 18th-century mansion in Saint-Germain, plus residences in Monte Carlo, Biarritz and Manhattan, not always resided in. He bought and sold the Ch\u00e2teau de Penho\u00ebt in Brittany, and a mansion near his childhood home (also sold, the landscape not being as he imagined it). Much of his antique collection was auctioned for more room and fewer memories, then he began to acquire again. Among the celebrated collaborators he repudiated were Lopez, his muses Anna Piaggi and Paloma Picasso, In\u00e8s de La Fressange (for posing as official model for the French symbol Marianne while under contract to Chanel), and the later house deity Claudia Schiffer. \u201cThe curtain falls,\u201d he said of his curtailment of friendships. \u201cAn iron curtain.\u201d He could be publicly dismissive of strangers, too, especially the looks and figures of non-ethereal women. Lagerfeld had adored Jacques de Bascher, a provincial fantasist who projected himself as an elegant aristo, and subsidised De Bascher to do the risky living for him, the drugs and sex Lagerfeld held back from. As Buck said: \u201cHe could look at Jacques\u2019 excesses from above, in a princely fashion; he himself was too grand.\u201d After De Bascher\u2019s death from Aids in 1989, Lagerfeld mourned him publicly but decreed the official line should be that he had never fallen in love: \u201cI am just in love with my job.\u201d A court dismissed Lagerfeld\u2019s suit for invasion of privacy against Alicia Drake, after the most telling chapter of her fashion memoir, The Beautiful Fall (2006), described the suicide near Penho\u00ebt of a member of Lagerfeld\u2019s entourage, which barely paused the posing and sketching at the ch\u00e2teau. \u201cI\u2019m floating. Nobody can catch me, mmm?\u201d was a Lagerfeld remark. So was, \u201cI don\u2019t know what normal means.\u201d \u2022 Karl Otto Lagerfeld, fashion designer, born 10 September 1933; died 19 February 2019",

      "bodyText": "The number of workers in the UK from elsewhere in the EU fell by 61,000 at a time when the number of British and non-EU workers soared, official figures show. There were an estimated 2.33 million workers from the EU27 in the UK between October to December in 2017, but that figure dropped to 2.27 million a year later. A notable drop in workers from A8 countries, which joined the bloc in 2004 and include Poland and the Czech Republic, largely accounted for the decrease. It contrasted with an increase in the number of non-EU workers in the UK, rising from 1.16 million to 1.29 million in the same period. This was an increase of 130,000 compared with the equivalent period 12 months earlier, and the highest number since records began in 1997. The figures, published by the Office for National Statistics, show the non-EU workforce consists of 277,000 workers from Africa, 593,000 from Asia, 299,000 from America and Oceania and 126,000 from European countries that are not members of the EU. There was a year-on-year increase in all these groups, including an 85,000 increase in the Asia category. About 869,000 people working in the UK in the latest quarter were from A8 states.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s official: Bernie Sanders announced today that he\u2019s going to run for president and lay the groundwork for transforming the economic and political life of this country. His decision comes not a moment too soon.</p> <p>After all, if you think things are bad now, imagine if Bernie Sanders hadn\u2019t run for president in 2016. Imagine if Hillary Clinton had swept the primaries that year, easily parrying Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s feeble blows and a few charming Lincoln Chafee debate performances. <br><br>Trump would have still beaten Clinton, but his charlatan, rightwing populism would have been the only outlet for those angry at the status quo. More than anything else, dejection would reign among voters. The Democrats would have heightened their focus on winning over \u201crespectable\u201d anti-Trump Republicans in the suburbs, with depoliticized calls to \u201cfix\u201d Obamacare, find \u201crealistic solutions\u201d to climate change, and make higher education \u201caccessible\u201d.</p> <p>Forget Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: in the early days of 2019 this would be the party of Michael Bloomberg. No surprise, in this scenario, that Trump would be polling narrowly ahead of all his contenders, the billionaire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/29/michael-bloomberg-new-hampshire-2020-trump\">Michael Bloomberg</a> included.</p> <p>But Bernie did run in 2016 \u2013 and not just for a single campaign, but something far greater. Sanders reintroduced working-class politics in the US. It was a style based on a simple message: you work hard, we\u2019re going to get you the dignity and security you deserve, and we\u2019re going to fight the millionaires and billionaires standing in the way. It was a politics, in other words, that created a common narrative of struggle in which the protagonists were those trying to get by in an unfair and unequal country.</p> <p>Sanders expertly communicated this message, by being as clear, direct, and honest as possible. His stump speeches used an even more limited vocabulary than Trump\u2019s. His lines were so predictable that crowds would finish his sentences. In May 2015, he said: \u201cThis campaign is not about Bernie Sanders ... This campaign is about the needs of the American people, and the ideas and proposals that effectively address those needs,\u201d and what endured from his campaign were precisely those ideas and proposals.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Democrats can\u2019t call him kooky and radical this time around</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bernie Sanders talked about the need for a Green New Deal, for Medicare-for-All (now supported by a sizable majority of Americans), for tuition-free higher education, for a jobs guarantee \u2013 all now part of the mainstream debate. Most importantly, as a democratic socialist he banded these policies together in a political framework, a way of understanding the challenges facing working people and possible solutions. Sanders also encouraged his supporters by the thousands to run for elected office. Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez and Rashida Tlaib are among those who answered the call, building off Bernie\u2019s program and reaching new audiences.</p> <p>Before 2016, who could forget that the Democratic party was dominated by charter-school supporting politicians and anti-public-sector-union types like Cory Booker and Rahm Emanuel? Now 2020 candidates who were silent during the 2012 Chicago teachers\u2019 strike are keen to show their solidarity with Los Angeles educators. It might not yet be the political revolution Sanders was calling for, but it\u2019s testament to his influence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/28/2020-presidential-election-democrats-poliices-identity\">Who should Democrats vote for in 2020? Let policies, not identity, decide | Clio Chang</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The spirit of 2016 may not last forever, and it\u2019s vital that we use the coming presidential campaign to do battle with the country\u2019s powerful economic and political establishment. We\u2019ll have to wait until 2024 for AOC to be eligible \u2013 for now Bernie Sanders is the only one capable of reaching millions of working Americans with the message that politics can indeed improve their lives. And not only can he continue to lay the groundwork for a left opposition to Trumpism: Bernie can actually win this time around.</p> <p>Sanders lost the 2016 primary because of early Super Tuesday setbacks, particularly among black American voters. The problem wasn\u2019t that he talked too much about class or inequality \u2013 in fact, many African American voters had similar economic views to Sanders \u2013 but rather that he wasn\u2019t seen as credible candidate. Not enough people knew who he was, and for those who stood to lose the most from a Trump presidency, Clinton seemed like the safer bet. That\u2019s not to mention her deep roots in the network of civic organizations and political leaders that drive turnout in southern primaries. By the time he was more established in 2016, in states like Michigan and Illinois, Sanders fared much better among black voters.</p> <p>Today, Sanders is viewed favorably among most Americans, <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/01/bernie-sanders-race-2020-candidacy\">even more so among black voters than white ones</a>, and is among the best known political figures on Earth. The once obscure junior senator from Vermont has come a long way. If Joe Biden doesn\u2019t run, Sanders seems to be the favorite at the start of this campaign cycle \u2013 polls even show him ahead of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/05/elizabeth-warren-2020-iowa-donald-trump\">Elizabeth Warren</a> in her home state of Massachusetts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b062a6eff8eccbc3b1d866c00710f7afee26daf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b062a6eff8eccbc3b1d866c00710f7afee26daf/282_0_3144_1886/1000.jpg\" alt=\"bernie 2020 sign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018His campaign infrastructure going into the primaries is unrivaled.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His campaign infrastructure going into the primaries is also unrivaled. Sanders received the most individual campaign contributions in history \u2013 his March 2016 FEC filing alone, in a month when he <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/3/23/11286028/sanders-fundraising-beating-clinton\">received $77m in donations from those giving less than $200</a>, was 188,613 pages long. With far more expertise and extensive email lists, Sanders won\u2019t be starting from scratch this time around.</p> <p>The young people that gave Sanders more primary votes than Clinton and Trump combined in 2016 are also primed to come out again for him. Where\u2019s the comparable group of dedicated canvassers and social media partisans ready to back Biden?</p> <p>Democrats can\u2019t call him kooky and radical this time around. More and more Democrats, including those who are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/15/democratic-2020-president-candidates-wall-street\">courting Wall Street</a>, are playing lip service to progressive demands such as a $15 minimum wage and Medicare-for-All. They can\u2019t do that and dismiss Sanders at the same time. Nor can some of the prospective Democratic candidates grumble about his age. Sanders will be 79 on Inauguration Day, but he\u2019s in great health and Biden himself would be 78, Warren 71.</p> <p>His chances in the general election against (a 74-year-old) Trump are even greater. Sanders appealed to independent voters and upset Clinton in states, like Michigan and Wisconsin, that Trump later captured. Despite having the benefits of incumbency, Trump is a historically weak candidate heading into 2020. A Politico/Morning Consult poll has him losing to Sanders 44% to 32%. With the CBO forecasting slowing economic growth in 2019 and 2020 and the administration plagued with controversy, that number might grow.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been wrong about this once before, but I\u2019d bet that whoever the Democratic nominee is in 2020, they\u2019ll be able to defeat Trump. That\u2019s all the more reason to go with the most viable progressive candidate \u2013 someone committed to change and with the knowledge and willingness to do battle with the big business interests that want to hear none of it.</p> <p>Near the end of his campaign in 2016, in a speech in Burlington, Sanders looked to the future: \u201cMy hope is that when future historians look back and describe how our country moved forward into reversing the drift toward oligarchy, and created a government which represents all the people and not just the few, they will note that, to a significant degree, that effort began with the political revolution of 2016.\u201d</p> <p>With the start of his 2020 bid \u2013 and with the exciting emergence of a new generation of politicians and activists who share his vision \u2013 there are more reasons than ever to believe him.</p> <ul> <li><p>Bhaskar Sunkara is the founding editor of Jacobin magazine and a Guardian US columnist.

Imagine if Hillary Clinton had swept the primaries that year, easily parrying Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s feeble blows and a few charming Lincoln Chafee debate performances. Trump would have still beaten Clinton, but his charlatan, rightwing populism would have been the only outlet for those angry at the status quo. More than anything else, dejection would reign among voters. The Democrats would have heightened their focus on winning over \u201crespectable\u201d anti-Trump Republicans in the suburbs, with depoliticized calls to \u201cfix\u201d Obamacare, find \u201crealistic solutions\u201d to climate change, and make higher education \u201caccessible\u201d. Forget Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: in the early days of 2019 this would be the party of Michael Bloomberg. No surprise, in this scenario, that Trump would be polling narrowly ahead of all his contenders, the billionaire Michael Bloomberg included. But Bernie did run in 2016 \u2013 and not just for a single campaign, but something far greater. Sanders reintroduced working-class politics in the US. It was a style based on a simple message: you work hard, we\u2019re going to get you the dignity and security you deserve, and we\u2019re going to fight the millionaires and billionaires standing in the way. It was a politics, in other words, that created a common narrative of struggle in which the protagonists were those trying to get by in an unfair and unequal country. Sanders expertly communicated this message, by being as clear, direct, and honest as possible. His stump speeches used an even more limited vocabulary than Trump\u2019s. His lines were so predictable that crowds would finish his sentences. In May 2015, he said: \u201cThis campaign is not about Bernie Sanders ... This campaign is about the needs of the American people, and the ideas and proposals that effectively address those needs,\u201d and what endured from his campaign were precisely those ideas and proposals. Bernie Sanders talked about the need for a Green New Deal, for Medicare-for-All (now supported by a sizable majority of Americans), for tuition-free higher education, for a jobs guarantee \u2013 all now part of the mainstream debate. Most importantly, as a democratic socialist he banded these policies together in a political framework, a way of understanding the challenges facing working people and possible solutions. Sanders also encouraged his supporters by the thousands to run for elected office. Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez and Rashida Tlaib are among those who answered the call, building off Bernie\u2019s program and reaching new audiences. Before 2016, who could forget that the Democratic party was dominated by charter-school supporting politicians and anti-public-sector-union types like Cory Booker and Rahm Emanuel? Now 2020 candidates who were silent during the 2012 Chicago teachers\u2019 strike are keen to show their solidarity with Los Angeles educators. It might not yet be the political revolution Sanders was calling for, but it\u2019s testament to his influence. The spirit of 2016 may not last forever, and it\u2019s vital that we use the coming presidential campaign to do battle with the country\u2019s powerful economic and political establishment. We\u2019ll have to wait until 2024 for AOC to be eligible \u2013 for now Bernie Sanders is the only one capable of reaching millions of working Americans with the message that politics can indeed improve their lives. And not only can he continue to lay the groundwork for a left opposition to Trumpism: Bernie can actually win this time around. Sanders lost the 2016 primary because of early Super Tuesday setbacks, particularly among black American voters. The problem wasn\u2019t that he talked too much about class or inequality \u2013 in fact, many African American voters had similar economic views to Sanders \u2013 but rather that he wasn\u2019t seen as credible candidate. Not enough people knew who he was, and for those who stood to lose the most from a Trump presidency, Clinton seemed like the safer bet. That\u2019s not to mention her deep roots in the network of civic organizations and political leaders that drive turnout in southern primaries. By the time he was more established in 2016, in states like Michigan and Illinois, Sanders fared much better among black voters. Today, Sanders is viewed favorably among most Americans, even more so among black voters than white ones, and is among the best known political figures on Earth. The once obscure junior senator from Vermont has come a long way. If Joe Biden doesn\u2019t run, Sanders seems to be the favorite at the start of this campaign cycle \u2013 polls even show him ahead of Elizabeth Warren in her home state of Massachusetts. His campaign infrastructure going into the primaries is also unrivaled. Sanders received the most individual campaign contributions in history \u2013 his March 2016 FEC filing alone, in a month when he received $77m in donations from those giving less than $200, was 188,613 pages long. With far more expertise and extensive email lists, Sanders won\u2019t be starting from scratch this time around. The young people that gave Sanders more primary votes than Clinton and Trump combined in 2016 are also primed to come out again for him. Where\u2019s the comparable group of dedicated canvassers and social media partisans ready to back Biden? Democrats can\u2019t call him kooky and radical this time around. More and more Democrats, including those who are courting Wall Street, are playing lip service to progressive demands such as a $15 minimum wage and Medicare-for-All. They can\u2019t do that and dismiss Sanders at the same time. Nor can some of the prospective Democratic candidates grumble about his age. Sanders will be 79 on Inauguration Day, but he\u2019s in great health and Biden himself would be 78, Warren 71. His chances in the general election against (a 74-year-old) Trump are even greater. Sanders appealed to independent voters and upset Clinton in states, like Michigan and Wisconsin, that Trump later captured. Despite having the benefits of incumbency, Trump is a historically weak candidate heading into 2020. A Politico/Morning Consult poll has him losing to Sanders 44% to 32%. With the CBO forecasting slowing economic growth in 2019 and 2020 and the administration plagued with controversy, that number might grow. I\u2019ve been wrong about this once before, but I\u2019d bet that whoever the Democratic nominee is in 2020, they\u2019ll be able to defeat Trump. That\u2019s all the more reason to go with the most viable progressive candidate \u2013 someone committed to change and with the knowledge and willingness to do battle with the big business interests that want to hear none of it. Near the end of his campaign in 2016, in a speech in Burlington, Sanders looked to the future: \u201cMy hope is that when future historians look back and describe how our country moved forward into reversing the drift toward oligarchy, and created a government which represents all the people and not just the few, they will note that, to a significant degree, that effort began with the political revolution of 2016.\u201d With the start of his 2020 bid \u2013 and with the exciting emergence of a new generation of politicians and activists who share his vision \u2013 there are more reasons than ever to believe him.

The ITF coordinator for the UK and Ireland, Ken Fleming, said the damning UN letter came on top of the US state department downgrading Ireland for its record in trafficking in persons in the fishing fleet and a critical report from the Council of Europe on the same issue. \u201cThe rapporteurs\u2019 warning is another vindication of what the ITF\u2019s been saying since this doomed scheme was brought in. We said it would lead to modern-day slavery; it has. When will the Irish government do the right thing, end this scheme, and work with us on a fair system that works?\u201d A spokesman for Ireland\u2019s Department of Justice and Equality said: \u201cThe minister takes any allegation of exploitation very seriously, particularly from UN special rapporteurs. A number of departments and agencies have responsibility in this area and will be responding to all matters raised.\u201d",

Marley, the novelist Angela Carter, the writer and traveller Gertrude Bell and the war correspondent Martha Gellhorn were among a cluster of names announced on Tuesday as figures to be celebrated in 2019 by the London heritage scheme. The house on Oakley Street, off King\u2019s Road, was where Marley lived with his band the Wailers in 1977. When they were not recording they would make the short trip over the Albert Bridge to play football in Battersea Park. It was while living in Oakley Street that Marley and the Wailers finished recording Exodus, the album which featured Jamming and One Love. The historian David Olusoga, a trustee of English Heritage and blue plaques panel member, said he was particularly excited by the Marley plaque. Marley, he said, remained \u201cone of the most loved and most listened to musicians of the 20th century. \u201cHe was one of the first superstars to come from a developing country. He is one of the most famous faces in the world, one of the most recognisable faces in the world, and he blazed a trail for other artists from developing countries.\u201d Marley once said he regarded London as his second home and his stay provided provided much-needed stability after the horrific events of 1976, when politically motivated gunmen shot Marley, his wife Rita and his manager Don Taylor. Around 12 blue plaques are given out each year and English Heritage is conscious of needing to have more women and more people of colour commemorated. Chairman Sir Tim Laurence said: \u201cWe went through a long phase where unless you were white and male you had less chance of getting a blue plaque. We are trying to make the selection much more balanced and more diverse.\u201d All possible recipients have to have been dead for at least 20 years and be nominated by members of the public. On Tuesday a plaque for the film-maker and gay rights campaigner Derek Jarman was unveiled on the former warehouse near Tower Bridge that he lived in and used as a studio. Later this year Carter will be honoured at her former home in Clapham, and Gellhorn at the house in Cadogan Square she called home for 28 years. Bell, the archaeologist, adventurer and diplomat who played an important role in establishing the modern state of Iraq, will be marked at a house in Chelsea which English Heritage said was a family home and her London base for over 40 years. One possible blot on Bell\u2019s reputation is her fervent opposition to women getting the vote.

On its <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/kormanyzat/photos/a.134933189912743/2510209519051753/?type=3&amp;theater\">official Facebook page</a>, the Hungarian government says the poster is part of an information campaign to tell the public about Brussels\u2019 migration plans, which it claims \u201cfundamentally endangered Hungary\u2019s safety\u201d.</p> <p>Although the government has previously run a \u201cStop Brussels\u201d campaign, the decision to use an image of Junker is an escalation in the Orb\u00e1n government\u2019s public relations war with the EU\u2019s most senior leaders.</p> <p>It also exposes the rift in the centre-right European People\u2019s party in the European parliament, which counts Juncker and Orb\u00e1n, as members.</p> <p>In an unusually forceful rebuttal against a member state, Juncker\u2019s chief spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, said the commission had made a commitment \u201cto fight disinformation and fake news\u201d and this case was no exception.</p> <p>\u201cThe Hungarian government campaign beggars belief,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is shocking that such a ludicrous conspiracy theory has reached the mainstream to the extent it has. There is no conspiracy. Hungarians deserve facts not fiction.\u201d</p> <p>Juncker and Orb\u00e1n have long had awkward relations. In 2014 Orb\u00e1n, along with the then UK prime minister, David Cameron, failed in an attempt to block Juncker from becoming commission president. Juncker once met Orb\u00e1n with the jokey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/may/22/hello-dictator-european-commission-president-juncker-jokes-hungarian-orban-video\">greeting \u201chello, dictator\u201d </a>and playfully tapped his face.

      "bodyText": "The European commission has accused Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government of a propagating a \u201cshocking\u201d and \u201cludicrous conspiracy theory\u201d, after Hungary launched a poster campaign targeting Jean-Claude Juncker. Opening a new front against Brussels a few months before European elections, the poster shows the European commission president alongside the Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros, a familiar target in Hungary. \u201cYou have the right to know what Brussels is planning to do,\u201d the poster says. On its official Facebook page, the Hungarian government says the poster is part of an information campaign to tell the public about Brussels\u2019 migration plans, which it claims \u201cfundamentally endangered Hungary\u2019s safety\u201d. Although the government has previously run a \u201cStop Brussels\u201d campaign, the decision to use an image of Junker is an escalation in the Orb\u00e1n government\u2019s public relations war with the EU\u2019s most senior leaders. It also exposes the rift in the centre-right European People\u2019s party in the European parliament, which counts Juncker and Orb\u00e1n, as members. In an unusually forceful rebuttal against a member state, Juncker\u2019s chief spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, said the commission had made a commitment \u201cto fight disinformation and fake news\u201d and this case was no exception. \u201cThe Hungarian government campaign beggars belief,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is shocking that such a ludicrous conspiracy theory has reached the mainstream to the extent it has. There is no conspiracy. Hungarians deserve facts not fiction.\u201d Juncker and Orb\u00e1n have long had awkward relations. In 2014 Orb\u00e1n, along with the then UK prime minister, David Cameron, failed in an attempt to block Juncker from becoming commission president. Juncker once met Orb\u00e1n with the jokey greeting \u201chello, dictator\u201d and playfully tapped his face. But the animus on Hungary\u2019s side deepened when the EU forced through mandatory refugee quotas in 2015 at the height of a humanitarian crisis. Hungary has always refused to take refugees under the quotas and continues to block an EU law that proposes a permanent redistribution system for asylum seekers. The poster refers to this theme, stating: \u201cThey want to introduce compulsory relocation quotas.\u201d The government campaign also accuses Juncker and Soros of wanting \u201cto weaken member states\u2019 rights to protect their own borders\u201d and claims \u201cthey want \u2026migrants\u2019 visas\u201d. EU leaders have repeatedly stressed their desire to strengthen Europe\u2019s borders in recent years, a policy that many diplomats say was influenced by Orb\u00e1n\u2019s approach. It was not immediately clear what the Hungarian government meant by \u201cmigrants\u2019 visas\u201d. The EU has a little-used blue-card scheme, modelled on the US green card that is intended to attract skilled labour. Under the scheme, member states decide how many non-EU migrants they admit. The commission rejected the Hungarian claims. \u201cThere is no \u2018they\u2019, only the European Union with Hungary sitting at the table,\u201d Schinas said. \u201cIt is not true that the EU supports or undermines border protection. Quite the contrary. And there are zero plans for so-called humanitarian visas.

The last time I saw Lagerfeld was in December, when he was well enough to travel to New York for a catwalk show staged in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. \u201cA pyramid is the greatest work of minimalist art,\u201d he said that day, of a collection that referenced ancient Egypt and the French graffiti artist Cyril Kongo. Looking frail, he took a catwalk bow flanked by Virginie Viard, his longstanding head of studio, and his young godson Hudson Kroenig. By last month, however, he was too unwell to attend the Chanel haute couture show at the Grand Palais in Paris, only a short distance from his home. A Chanel spokesperson played down his non-appearance that day, citing the cold and snowy weather. Lagerfeld became a designer at Fendi in 1965 and founded his own brand in 1984, but it was his success at the house of Chanel, where he became designer in 1983, that is his unparalleled achievement. Other brands have followed Chanel\u2019s formula for rejuvenation since, but none has equalled Lagerfeld\u2019s sustained success in keeping Chanel at the pinnacle of fashion, suspended above the laws of fashion gravity, for over half a century. Lagerfeld supersized the fashion show. He reimagined the catwalk as a theatre that could take many forms: the interior of a private jet, for which the audience were issued boarding passes and strapped into airline seats; a casino, in which the Oscar-winning actor Julianne Moore and a supporting cast of supermodels played out a vignette of late-night high rollers, dressed in Chanel\u2019s finest. Lagerfeld could be crass when commenting on the world outside fashion \u2013 he famously called Adele \u201ca little too fat\u201d and in November 2017 provoked outrage when he evoked the Holocaust in reference to Angela Merkel\u2019s immigration policy \u2013 but the commentary he made through his catwalks was subtle. In March 2015, shortly after the Charlie Hebdo attacks, he recreated an iconic Paris bistro on the catwalk, a celebration of cafe culture staged as a statement in support of the French way of life. The hypermarch\u00e9-sized Chanel store which he installed in the Grand Palais, with models walking between aisles filled with double-C branded household goods, was a mischievous commentary on the power of branding, and a brilliant piece of the fashion theatre at which Lagerfeld excelled.",

But let\u2019s face it, at this stage most people would have a hard time noticing the words \u201cwe\u2019re actually fucked\u201d wasn\u2019t their own internal monologue. Angela Smith, one of the seven \u201csplitters\u201d gave a speech in which she said that she didn\u2019t think any of the major political parties were fit for power and cited antisemitic racism as one of the reasons she left Labour. It was good. Luciana Berger also made a solid, heartfelt speech. Things were back on track. Now what the new non-racist party in town needs is celebrity endorsements, which they soon got when Katie Hopkins briefly stopped frothing at the mouth in order to praise Chuka Umunna. \u201cSo far so good,\u201d they probably thought to themselves. \u201cAs long as nobody goes on national TV and does a racism then everything is fine. Oh. Oh no. Oh no, no, no.\u201d Because just two hours after launching the new non-racist political grouping, Angela Smith, one seventh of everyone\u2019s new favourite non-racist political grouping, went on live TV and appeared to refer to people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds as having a \u201cfunny tinge\u201d. I know you think it\u2019s bad, but look at it this way: after one morning they\u2019d already chalked up their first racism scandal \u2013 just like a real mainstream party. Angela even apologised for \u201cany offence caused\u201d rather than the remark itself: proper, statesmanlike, frontbench stuff. It wasn\u2019t long before the smears began emanating from outside of the group, too. Corbyn-supporting Skwawkbox, well known for crying \u201cconspiracy\u201d when there isn\u2019t one, surprised everybody by yelling \u201cconspiracy\u201d when there wasn\u2019t one. They did some digging and found that the \u201cnew\u201d website was actually registered in 2015. A \u201cfact\u201d they discovered by misreading the date. The day almost over, the new party\u2019s MPs responded to calls from Labour\u2019s John McDonnell to stand for re-election in their constituencies by refusing to do so. \u201cThey said we wouldn\u2019t be a major force in British politics,\u201d they probably thought to themselves. \u201cBut here we are on day one and we\u2019ve got a racism scandal under our belt and have already ruled out a people\u2019s vote. Just like the big boys.\u201d Nor did the Independent Group rule out MPs accused of sexual harassment being allowed to join. Less than 12 hours after launch, then, and they\u2019ve already made it clear they\u2019re an incompetent bunch of catastrophes that most of the population would feel extremely conflicted about voting for. In other words, they bear all the hallmarks of a mainstream political movement \u2013 in their own terms, at least, a resounding success. As far as political launches go, my only major concern is that they may have peaked too soon. Or that the fear of being seen as institutionally racist will mean it\u2019s only a matter of time until the splitters split. On the other hand, it has been a tough few days for anyone who is vaguely interested in the prospect of not having a sociopathic group of Tories rule the country until the end of time itself. To cap it all, like a toddler who craps its pants to distract from the fact it has wet itself, the Labour party chose this moment to let it slip that Derek Hatton is back in the party. People on the left are now spoilt for choice. We can either vote for a party beset by racism accusations who look like they won\u2019t get into power (you Corbyn cultist!) or a party beset by racism accusations who definitely won\u2019t get in power (you Blairite melt!). Meanwhile the Tories probably spent the day stockpiling something sinister like orphanages or double-decker coffins. We were too busy watching the only viable alternative attacking the real enemy \u2013 fellow lefties. \u2022 James Felton is a TV and radio comedy writer.",

I\u2019m pretty lucky to be doing what I\u2019m doing in beyond-perfect conditions.\u201d At the couture show in January his long-term righthand woman, Virginie Viard, appeared hand-in-hand with the season\u2019s couture bride to greet the audience, at Lagerfeld\u2019s request to \u201crepresent him\u201d. Chanel confirmed on Tuesday that Viard \u201chas been entrusted by [Chanel chief executive] Alain Wertheimer with the creative work for the collections, so that the legacy of Gabrielle Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld can live on\u201d. The brand\u2019s president of fashion, Bruno Pavlovsky, said: \u201cFashion show after fashion show, collection after collection, Karl Lagerfeld left his mark on the legend of Gabrielle Chanel and the history of the House of Chanel. The greatest tribute we can pay today is to continue to follow the path he traced by \u2013 to quote Karl \u2013 \u2018continuing to embrace the present and invent the future\u2019.\u201d",

Were he a purely literary invention, you would likely dismiss him as too excessive to be real: a parodic caricature, an \u201celegant tramp\u201d, something of a dandy, a prodigious drinker and (for a few years) a drug addict, something of an intellectual, an \u201cartist\u201d who sat in cafes and bars making inept ballpoint drawings, often sexual in content. The young West was the kind of guy you might learn to steer clear of in those bars in Vienna from which he hadn\u2019t already been ejected or banned. Oh God, here comes Franz!</p> <p>He could be a bore and an obsessive, on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/19/schubert-ferocious-tender-sublime\">Schubert</a>, on Wittgenstein, on Freud, on <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lacan/\">Lacan</a>, and who knows what else. His tirades \u2013 against the actionists and the Wiener Gruppe of experimental writers, and against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/feb/07/2\">Martin Kippenberger</a> (whom he thought of as insincere and a bit of a fraud, even though the two had more in common than either might admit) \u2013 led acquaintances to frequently tell him to piss off. There were punch-ups and there was blood.</p> <p>Adrift and unknown as an artist in an equally unbelievable yet peculiarly overheated Viennese cultural milieu, West desperately wanted to be famous and to prove himself as an artist. The romantic desire for fame is as good a drive as any other for a young artist on the make. The bawdiness, even baseness and obscenity of his early drawings were no impediment.</p> <p>All this tells us that artists don\u2019t have to be reasonable or moderate, although a certain wearying male stereotype is confirmed, not least by the essays, testimonials and reminiscences of his friends, former collaborators, dealers and admirers in the catalogue. This all makes for a fascinating show, and West deserves not a novel (unless it had been by his fellow Austrian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/02/prose-translation-thomas-bernhard-austrian-writer\">Thomas Bernhard</a>) but a decent biography.</p> <p>The artist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jul/27/franz-west\">who died in 2012</a>, really did have something. Despite \u2013 and also because of \u2013 his temperament, he made the kind of art he did. His work was a kind of behaviour. The heavy emphasis on the artist\u2019s life is inevitable given the degree to which personal relationships and collaborations, a sort of reactive creativity to situations, was at the heart of his work.

Sometimes things remained recognisable, but mostly not. His old bed became a kind of freestanding prow, covered in layers of foil.

Now, I think, with our country dangerously divided and politicians of all parties discredited, we should listen to British businesses and preserve jobs by voting to remain. The EU is by no means an ideal partner, but better the devil you know. Why take a step into the unknown?</p> <p>In the referendum, we were asked to vote while blind to the facts; we were totally unprepared and ill-informed. Now that we understand the consequences, we can make a better assessment of the impact on our children\u2019s and grandchildren\u2019s futures. I am also beginning to agree with members of the younger generation who feel betrayed that the small majority in the referendum was largely down to votes by senior citizens, who will not inherit the problems their reckless actions will bring.</p> <p>If we leave, there will be huge uncertainty and a protracted period of readjustment during which many thousands of jobs will be lost. Our vital services will be undermined, and securing trade deals with the rest of the world will take much too long. It\u2019s my democratic right to change my mind, and I think we should stay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7472c821993be1d0d14bf0ef15f6b87c661ecc62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7472c821993be1d0d14bf0ef15f6b87c661ecc62/0_159_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Duncan Manton \u2026 \u2018There\u2019s too much reliance on other nations.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Duncan Manton \u2026 \u2018There\u2019s too much reliance on other nations.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Duncan Manton, 37, south Lincolnshire</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019m a qualified maths teacher, but stopped working at Christmas because we have three small children. My wife is a chef. I felt, and still feel, the EU is an unnecessary organisation that allows richer countries to leech workers from its poorer members. There\u2019s too much reliance on other nations, and I\u2019d like to see us invest in proper training, so that we don\u2019t have to rely on foreign nationals.</p> <p>The vote was really over whether we wanted a change, and I did. I didn\u2019t expect leave to win, to be honest. Also, we shouldn\u2019t have triggered article 50 so soon.

      "bodyText": "Voted leave, but now think the UK should remain in the EU Barbara Morgan, 73, Newton Abbot, Devon I voted to leave the EU purely as an emotionally driven response, to rid ourselves of David Cameron and George Osborne. Now, I think, with our country dangerously divided and politicians of all parties discredited, we should listen to British businesses and preserve jobs by voting to remain. The EU is by no means an ideal partner, but better the devil you know. Why take a step into the unknown? In the referendum, we were asked to vote while blind to the facts; we were totally unprepared and ill-informed. Now that we understand the consequences, we can make a better assessment of the impact on our children\u2019s and grandchildren\u2019s futures. I am also beginning to agree with members of the younger generation who feel betrayed that the small majority in the referendum was largely down to votes by senior citizens, who will not inherit the problems their reckless actions will bring. If we leave, there will be huge uncertainty and a protracted period of readjustment during which many thousands of jobs will be lost. Our vital services will be undermined, and securing trade deals with the rest of the world will take much too long. It\u2019s my democratic right to change my mind, and I think we should stay. Duncan Manton, 37, south Lincolnshire I\u2019m a qualified maths teacher, but stopped working at Christmas because we have three small children. My wife is a chef. I felt, and still feel, the EU is an unnecessary organisation that allows richer countries to leech workers from its poorer members. There\u2019s too much reliance on other nations, and I\u2019d like to see us invest in proper training, so that we don\u2019t have to rely on foreign nationals. The vote was really over whether we wanted a change, and I did. I didn\u2019t expect leave to win, to be honest. Also, we shouldn\u2019t have triggered article 50 so soon. Instead, we should have recognised that the British public had only narrowly suggested we leave, gone back to the EU and asked them how they could persuade us to stay.

All products of animal origin entering the EU would face SPS checks.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe EU\u2019s current position is that 100% of imports would need to be checked.

      "bodyText": "The government will apply tariffs to food imports to protect British farmers in a no-deal scenario, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, has confirmed. And, contrary to claims by hard Brexiters, he warned that delays were likely in Calais because of mandatory EU checks on food imports on the French side of the channel. The tariff regime Britain would like to apply in the event of no deal will be revealed in the \u201cnext few days\u201d. He told the National Farmers\u2019 Union\u2019s annual conference in Birmingham that reports that Britain would operate a zero tariff regime in order to secure frictionless trade in a no-deal scenario were \u201cnot accurate\u201d. \u201cOne thing I can reassure you it will not be the case that we will have zero rate tariffs on products, there will be protections for sensitive sections of agriculture and food production,\u201d Gove said. He later hinted that the tariffs would apply to beef and \u201cparticularly\u201d lamb, citing livestock farmers as the most vulnerable in a no-deal scenario. He refused to reassure farmers who pressed him about protection for cereal farmers, suggesting zero tariffs were a possibility in some areas. Urging farmers to petition their MPs to vote for Theresa May\u2019s deal, he said the clear priority was to secure a deal. \u201cThe tariffs that will be announced in the event of no deal are not our preferred policy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be taken as the be all and end all of UK policy, absolutely not.\u201d Gove promised British food standards will not be lowered \u201cin pursuit of trade deals\u201d and vowed to minimise the risk that food producers will be left at \u201ccompetitive disadvantage\u201d in the face of cheaper tariff-free imports that are below EU standards. In a keynote speech to the NFU, Gove also warned that British farmers could be locked out of the EU from 30 March in the event of no deal and that checks at Calais on food exports would \u201cfur up\u201d the arteries of trade, contrary to claims by the French port that there would not be delays. \u201cWe can expect, at least in the short term, that those delays in Calais will impede the loading of ferries, constricting supply routes back into Britain and furring up the arteries of commerce on which we all rely,\u201d said Gove. The NFU recently warned that health and safety audits required on individual food processing plans required by the EU could take up to six months to complete, effectively locking British farming exporters out of the bloc. On Tuesday Gove confirmed this by pointing out the EU had not yet classified the UK as a \u201cthird country\u201d, which will only happen after health and safety audits are complete. \u201cThe EU still have not listed the UK as a full third country \u2026 As I speak there is no absolute guarantee we will continue to be able to export to the EU,\u201d he told farmers. Gove also said that the dangers of no deal would not be removed if, in future, a trade deal was sealed between the UK and the EU. Once tariffs are imposed by the EU on British exports \u201cit will be difficult to re-establish that market access even if tariffs reduced in the future\u201d. Contrary to claims by Calais authorities, Gove said there will be delays at the port because of mandatory sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks on any food or animal products exported to the bloc from Britain. \u201cTariffs are not the only problem we would face. All products of animal origin entering the EU would face SPS checks. \u201cThe EU\u2019s current position is that 100% of imports would need to be checked. In order to be checked, every import would need to go through a border inspection post,\u201d said Gove. The reference to EU law comes weeks after Brexiters seized on claims by Calais chiefs that there would be no delays at the port. It is understood the local politicians have written to the French government asking for derogation from EU law, but it is not clear whether the EU would allow any opt out at the port. Gove said: \u201cA huge proportion of our food exports to the EU currently go through Calais. As I speak there are no border inspection posts [BIP] at Calais. None. The French authorities promise to invest in BIP capacity but with just six weeks to go we face considerable uncertainty over future arrangements. \u201cThe requirement for checks will inevitably slow the processing of exports, and for every lorry that is delayed at Calais there is a knock-on effect for other haulage and the rapid turn-around of roll-on roll-off ferries.\u201d",

The short answer to why anyone would do something as morally awful as this, is of course: to make money. The fake leukaemia drug, containing mostly paracetamol, is being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/12/fake-cancer-drug-made-from-paracetamol-world-health-organization\" title=\"\">sold for $13,500 a pack</a> \u2013 $450 a pill \u2013 in the US, or \u00a35,000 a pack in the UK. There is now a far larger market for legal medicines than there is for illegal drugs, such as heroin or cocaine, and there\u2019s a much smaller chance of getting caught. The (genuine) pills are for seriously sick people, so if a patient doesn\u2019t blossom back to health after taking (fake) treatments, doctors generally blame the tumour, not the pill.</p> <p>Drug dealers are apparently figuring this out \u2013 researchers have found traces of ecstasy and Viagra ingredients in pills posing as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-10-352\" title=\"\">antimalarial medicine</a>. Falsifiers monitor worried posts on patient forums, clock shortages of specific drugs, weigh up what the most anxious might pay for an online sale, how distracted the national regulator might be, and move in opportunistically to fill the gap.</p> <p>On all counts, people in the UK are vulnerable right now. The criminals\u2019 business model depends on patients taking risks. And desperate patients will buy medicines from dodgy sources for lots of reasons,<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327775782\" title=\"\"> our research shows</a>. If the medicine you need isn\u2019t covered by your insurance or health service, you turn to the internet (think of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/27/nhs-fund-anti-hiv-drugs-prep\" title=\"\">HIV-prevention pill PrEP</a> in England and Wales, for example). If you\u2019re embarrassed to ask for a prescription, or you don\u2019t have time to go and queue at the surgery, or you distrust the generic medicine on offer at the hospital and would rather buy a well-known brand, or you were redirected to an online pharmacy while self-diagnosing a nasty rash \u2013 all these are reasons to step away from the really very safe supply chains that the NHS and most bricks-and-mortar pharmacies in the UK provide. </p> <p>Recently patients in the UK have mentioned yet another reason for drifting away from safe sources for their medicines: the threat of a no-deal Brexit. Patients are reported to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/18/revealed-uk-patients-stockpile-drugs-in-fear-of-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">buying essential medicines</a> wherever they can, stockpiling because they fear shortages after Brexit. It\u2019s a very legitimate fear.</p> <p>At the moment,EU governments work together through the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to license medicines for use throughout the 28 nations. But there\u2019s no clear legal provision for the circulation in the UK of products authorised by the EMA after 29 March. The UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is doing its best to re-establish itself as an independent regulator; it has cobbled together a <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179185/contents\" title=\"\">188-page draft amendment</a> to current medicines regulations to stave off the worst effects of crashing out of Europe\u2019s effective regulatory structures. That, together with a diplomatically apocalyptic \u201cexplanatory memorandum\u201d is sitting in parliament\u2019s inbox, along with a zillion other pieces of urgent legislation, itching to be reviewed and signed before exit from the EU.</p> <p>If it doesn\u2019t get signed in time, the fallout may be dire. In 2018, the UK imported close to 15m kg of medicine a month from other EU countries on average, according to <a href=\"https://www.uktradeinfo.com/Statistics/BuildYourOwnTables/Pages/Table.aspx?savedview=7cd18b3e-1a1f-4217-a741-d82db4321ab2\" title=\"\">HMRC customs figures</a>, some 5m more than it exported to them. That\u2019s an awful lot of products to be in sudden limbo, leaving an awful lot of patients in potential need.</p> <p>Even if an orderly exit deal is done, delays related to paperwork and border checks will threaten smooth supply, possibly leading to gaps on pharmacy shelves. Though there is every indication that the MHRA is bending over backwards to minimise disruption to companies, shelves will grow even emptier if the regulator is pressured to \u201ctake back control\u201d by requiring UK-specific product registration. Some companies will decide the number of patients in the UK doesn\u2019t justify the cost of registering products for rare conditions here; they\u2019ll forgo UK sales, and UK patients may forgo longer or healthier lives. Expensive product registration also pushes up prices, increasing pressure on the NHS and perhaps restricting wide access to expensive new medicines for all Britons.</p> <p>All of these things would mean even more patients turning to the internet for an affordable version of something they want or need and can\u2019t easily get from their local pharmacy through the NHS. And that, in turn, will make the UK a more lucrative market for criminals flogging fake cures over the internet.</p> <p>\u2022 Elizabeth Pisani is a visiting senior research fellow at the Policy Institute, King\u2019s College London</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/18/revealed-uk-patients-stockpile-drugs-in-fear-of-no-deal-brexit\">Revealed: UK patients stockpile drugs in fear of no-deal Brexit</a> </p> </aside>",

      "bodyText": "Some crimes are just worse than others. When I tell people I research the market for fake and substandard medicines, their most common reaction is: \u201cFake cancer medicines? That\u2019s horrible. Why would anyone do that?\u201d The World Health Organization reported earlier this month that fake leukaemia medicine, packaged for the UK market to look like the genuine drug Iclusig, was circulating in Europe and the Americas. The short answer to why anyone would do something as morally awful as this, is of course: to make money. The fake leukaemia drug, containing mostly paracetamol, is being sold for $13,500 a pack \u2013 $450 a pill \u2013 in the US, or \u00a35,000 a pack in the UK. There is now a far larger market for legal medicines than there is for illegal drugs, such as heroin or cocaine, and there\u2019s a much smaller chance of getting caught. The (genuine) pills are for seriously sick people, so if a patient doesn\u2019t blossom back to health after taking (fake) treatments, doctors generally blame the tumour, not the pill. Drug dealers are apparently figuring this out \u2013 researchers have found traces of ecstasy and Viagra ingredients in pills posing as antimalarial medicine. Falsifiers monitor worried posts on patient forums, clock shortages of specific drugs, weigh up what the most anxious might pay for an online sale, how distracted the national regulator might be, and move in opportunistically to fill the gap. On all counts, people in the UK are vulnerable right now. The criminals\u2019 business model depends on patients taking risks. And desperate patients will buy medicines from dodgy sources for lots of reasons, our research shows. If the medicine you need isn\u2019t covered by your insurance or health service, you turn to the internet (think of the HIV-prevention pill PrEP in England and Wales, for example). If you\u2019re embarrassed to ask for a prescription, or you don\u2019t have time to go and queue at the surgery, or you distrust the generic medicine on offer at the hospital and would rather buy a well-known brand, or you were redirected to an online pharmacy while self-diagnosing a nasty rash \u2013 all these are reasons to step away from the really very safe supply chains that the NHS and most bricks-and-mortar pharmacies in the UK provide. Recently patients in the UK have mentioned yet another reason for drifting away from safe sources for their medicines: the threat of a no-deal Brexit. Patients are reported to be buying essential medicines wherever they can, stockpiling because they fear shortages after Brexit. It\u2019s a very legitimate fear. At the moment,EU governments work together through the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to license medicines for use throughout the 28 nations. But there\u2019s no clear legal provision for the circulation in the UK of products authorised by the EMA after 29 March. The UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is doing its best to re-establish itself as an independent regulator; it has cobbled together a 188-page draft amendment to current medicines regulations to stave off the worst effects of crashing out of Europe\u2019s effective regulatory structures. That, together with a diplomatically apocalyptic \u201cexplanatory memorandum\u201d is sitting in parliament\u2019s inbox, along with a zillion other pieces of urgent legislation, itching to be reviewed and signed before exit from the EU. If it doesn\u2019t get signed in time, the fallout may be dire. In 2018, the UK imported close to 15m kg of medicine a month from other EU countries on average, according to HMRC customs figures, some 5m more than it exported to them. That\u2019s an awful lot of products to be in sudden limbo, leaving an awful lot of patients in potential need. Even if an orderly exit deal is done, delays related to paperwork and border checks will threaten smooth supply, possibly leading to gaps on pharmacy shelves. Though there is every indication that the MHRA is bending over backwards to minimise disruption to companies, shelves will grow even emptier if the regulator is pressured to \u201ctake back control\u201d by requiring UK-specific product registration. Some companies will decide the number of patients in the UK doesn\u2019t justify the cost of registering products for rare conditions here; they\u2019ll forgo UK sales, and UK patients may forgo longer or healthier lives. Expensive product registration also pushes up prices, increasing pressure on the NHS and perhaps restricting wide access to expensive new medicines for all Britons. All of these things would mean even more patients turning to the internet for an affordable version of something they want or need and can\u2019t easily get from their local pharmacy through the NHS. And that, in turn, will make the UK a more lucrative market for criminals flogging fake cures over the internet. \u2022 Elizabeth Pisani is a visiting senior research fellow at the Policy Institute, King\u2019s College London",

Jon Boys, the labour market economist for the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said: \u201cWith fewer EU nationals working in the UK as the same time last year, it\u2019s vital that the government recognises the need for a flexible post-Brexit migration system to avoid worsening skill and labour shortages.\u201d Despite the acceleration in vacancies, pay growth still remains far below the previous peak of 6.6% recorded in February 2007 before the financial crisis. Vacancies at that time were close to their pre-crash peak of about 650,000 unfilled jobs. Economists believe higher levels of precarious employment since the crash, as well as a reduction in trades union bargaining power, could be among reasons for weak wages growth after a \u201clost decade\u201d for workers\u2019 pay rises. Average weekly total pay is also still about \u00a331 below the pre-downturn peak after inflation. The ONS said that as many as 844,000 people were employed on zero-hours contracts in their main job, down by 57,000 from a year earlier, although this figure is still above the pre-crisis level. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: \u201cEmployers are still not giving people the pay rises they deserve, leaving them worse-off than a decade ago. Millions don\u2019t have the security of a solid job, because the government won\u2019t crack down on insecure work. And the prime minister\u2019s reckless Brexit strategy is causing employers to take flight.\u201d Alok Sharma, the employment minister, said: \u201cWhile the global economy is facing many challenges, particularly in sectors like manufacturing, these figures show the underlying resilience of our jobs market \u2013 once again delivering record employment levels.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>1) Can they get 16 into 15?</strong></h2> <p>England play 11 one-day internationals and two international warm-up matches before the World Cup starts on 30 May, but this five-match series is the last before they must announce their 15-man squad. A 16th space would allow them to cover all bases, but 15 means a corner needs to be cut. They are likely to want two spare seam bowlers, especially as those players are most susceptible to injury, which means they will have to sacrifice either a second back-up batsman (Alex Hales will be the first) or a back-up spinner. Or they could cheat. That\u2019s what they have done with the current squad, in which Joe Denly nominally fills both roles. Denly\u2019s last ODI appearance was in 2009 and England need to find out whether he, with support from Joe Root, is a realistic option should Adil Rashid or Moeen Ali sustain an injury. The alternatives are not irresistible, though Liam Dawson \u2013 not in the squad for West Indies \u2013 would be a more reliable, like\u2011for\u2011like substitute.</p> <h2><strong>2) Who\u2019ll share the new ball with Woakes?</strong></h2> <p>It feels safe to assume 10 of England\u2019s XI for the first World Cup match against South Africa: Bairstow, Roy, Root, Morgan, Stokes, Buttler, Ali, Woakes, Rashid, Plunkett. That leaves a space for someone to share the new ball with Chris Woakes, and this series will be an unofficial shootout between Mark Wood, Tom Curran and the much improved David Willey. All three are battling for a place in the team \u2013 and also, perhaps, for a place in the squad. If England decide Jofra Archer\u2019s talent is too seductive to ignore \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/20/eoin-morgan-jofra-archer-england-cricket\" title=\"\">he becomes available for selection after this series</a> \u2013 one of Wood, Curran and Willey will miss out. The decision is complicated by the fact that all have different virtues: Wood\u2019s pace and effervescence, Curran\u2019s variety and big-stage swagger, Willey\u2019s new-ball threat and lower-order hitting.</p> <h2><strong>3) Was Wood\u2019s fierce spell a one-off?</strong></h2> <p>The West Indies series should provide a strong clue as to whether Wood\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/10/west-indies-england-third-test-day-two-match-report-mark-wood\" title=\"\">first-innings spell in St Lucia</a> was a magical one-off or something more significant. Before he was recalled for the third Test, Wood was hanging on to a place in the World Cup squad, never mind the team, but if he can regularly bowl at 95mph he will be hard to leave out of the XI. Although Wood\u2019s one-day record is poor \u2013 he averages nearly 50 with the ball \u2013 most of his success has come in bigger games and pressure moments. When he is in the team and bowling well, English cricket is a much happier place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99806bbd9eb287643f3d744d51d96ddd85f098a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99806bbd9eb287643f3d744d51d96ddd85f098a3/0_118_3170_1902/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Wood\u2019s explosive spell in St Lucia has put him in contention but his ODI record is poor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Wood\u2019s explosive spell in St Lucia has put him in contention but his ODI record is poor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlie Crowhurst/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>4) Can Woakes\u2019s knee bear the schedule?</strong></h2> <p>Woakes has quietly become, along with Adil Rashid, the most irreplaceable player in England\u2019s one-day team. He is Eoin Morgan\u2019s banker with the new ball and at the death, and also averages 38 with the bat since England\u2019s ODI revolution began in 2015. The catch is that Woakes has missed a lot of cricket through injury in recent times, mainly because of a chronic knee problem. The West Indies series, with five games in 11 days, should give England a greater understanding of whether he will be able to cope with the World Cup marathon, or whether they need to ration his appearances.</p> <h2><strong>5) Has Rashid\u2019s confidence been hit?</strong></h2> <p>While England would like Wood\u2019s Test form to bleed into ODIs, they will want the opposite with Adil Rashid. Though he had a good series in Sri Lanka, Rashid\u2019s poor performance in Barbados may well be his last at Test level. Rashid is a strange mix of confidence and fragility, nous and naivety, and England will hope he can pick up where he left off in one-day cricket. He has been England\u2019s best bowler since the last World Cup, and only Afghanistan\u2019s Rashid Khan has taken more ODI wickets in that time. There is enough evidence to suggest that he is completely at peace in one\u2011day cricket, where he is expertly managed by Morgan, and his performance in the warm-up game was encouraging. But England will breathe a little easier once normal service is resumed.</p> <h2><strong>6) Will there be last-minute changes?</strong></h2> <p>There is a history of England making last-minute changes to their World Cup plans, from dropping their best player, Nick Knight, on the eve of the 1999 tournament to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/19/alastair-cook-dropped-england-captain-2015-cricket-world-cup\" title=\"\">sacking Alastair Cook in 2014</a>. There are unlikely to be any surprises this time, such is Morgan\u2019s aversion to such desperate nonsense and the stability of a side that have won their last nine ODI series. But if there is to be a last-minute switch, the most vulnerable players are Liam Plunkett and Jonny Bairstow. Plunkett, whose middle-overs threat has been fundamental to England\u2019s success, turns 34 in April and has shown signs of his birth certificate. Bairstow, after an astonishing spell of form in 50-over cricket last summer, has had a strange few months in all forms of the game \u2013 and the openers will always be the most vulnerable batsmen because of Hales\u2019s presence on the sidelines. Plunkett and Bairstow surely have enough credit in the bank, but a strong series would keep any speculation at bay.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong><em>This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/sign-up-to-the-spin\" title=\"\"><strong><em>To subscribe, just visit this page and follow the instructions</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>",

This raises the question of why demonstrations in 2018, on a range of different issues, were attended by roughly the same group of non-aligned protesters. What were the common mobilising factors?</p> <p>Despite the eagerness of some to describe these demonstrations as fascist, they fit much more comfortably within political scientist Cas Mudde\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/22/populism-concept-defines-our-age\" title=\"\">definition of populism</a>: \u201can ideology that considers society to be separated into two homogeneous and antagonistic groups, \u2018the pure people\u2019 versus \u2018the corrupt elite\u2019, and which argues that politics should be an expression of the <em>volont\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale </em>(general will) of the people.\u201d</p> <p>This current movement\u2019s binary distinction between the \u201cpure people\u201d and the \u201ccorrupt elite\u201d is why the accusation of \u201ctraitor\u201d is so readily thrown at any authority figure they disagree with, be they remain politicians or the judges who sentenced Robinson to prison. Those who disagree with their take on any issue are understood to be disagreeing with the will of the people.</p> <p>Though there were fascists in the crowds, the majority of the organisers and participants cannot accurately be described as fascists. On the whole, this angry mass of protestors lack a structured ideology and are driven much more by visceral emotions such as anger and betrayal.</p> <p>This is not to say that what starts as an emotional mobilisation cannot be increasingly politicised towards fascism. We saw this with the EDL, with many individuals starting out as single-issue activists then expanding their ideological outlook to a much more traditionally fascist platform over time.</p> <p>The fact that these demonstrators self-identify as \u201cthe people\u201d and have great antipathy towards supposed elites, could explain their reticence to have formal structures which necessitate hierarchies. Generally speaking, this is a movement with organisers, spokespeople and \u201cmartyrs\u201d rather than traditional leaders. While Robinson is an important figurehead for this movement, he has not sought to launch a formal vehicle, or adopt a formalised leadership position within it, as he did with the EDL and <a href=\"https://www.hopenothate.org.uk/research/investigations/pegida-uk/\" title=\"\">Pegida UK</a> in the past.</p> <p>Similarly, in the wake of the yellow vests\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/23/police-probe-far-right-yellow-vest-group-anna-soubry\" title=\"\">harassment of Anna Soubry MP</a> and others outside parliament in January, the press labelled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/12/police-arrest-james-goddard-on-suspicion-of-public-order-offences\" title=\"\">James Goddard</a> as the network\u2019s leader. Yet Goddard responded: \u201cThe #YellowVestsUK has no leader or political affiliation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/16/britons-disillusion-political-main-parties-turn-to-far-right\" title=\"\">They can\u2019t silence us all!</a>\u201d</p> <p>The lack of formal leaders, however, does not mean they are directionless \u2013 merely that the rank and file looks to a range of far-right social-media influencers and the alternative media for direction rather than a formal leadership team.</p> <p>In recent years, we have seen the rise of disparate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/18/report-youtubes-alternative-influence-network-breeds-rightwing-radicalisation\" title=\"\">far-right social-media personalities</a> who now have the ability to reach unprecedented numbers of people online.</p> <p>Together, the collection of post-organisational far-right influencers provide a veritable pick\u2019n\u2019mix of grievances for demonstrators to choose from \u2013 each mutually reinforcing the overarching sense that the system is rigged against them.</p> <p>How long this movement can continue as a shapeless and leaderless mass of angry people is difficult to say. It is of course possible that it could solidify into a more formalised movement under the leadership of Lennon, or within Ukip, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2019/jan/22/how-ukip-embraced-the-far-right-podcast\" title=\"\">which has embraced the far right</a> under Gerard Batten.</p> <p>With trust in politicians and our political system at a low point, there is a ready pool of people who could be attracted to this type of messaging. Whatever happens with Brexit there is bound to be a narrative of betrayal being advanced by the far right that will likely speak to large numbers of people in the UK and reinforce existing disillusionment.</p> <p>Regardless, we cannot wait for a traditional, united, far-right umbrella organisation to emerge before we act. We need to start connecting the dots now and to realise that what we\u2019ve seen over the last year is various incarnations of the same threat.</p> <p>The modern British far right is a hydra, making it harder to combat in a traditional sense. If one prominent activist or leader falls from grace, it is no longer the fatal blow it once was, as others rapidly emerge to fill the void. The hate might be the same as before, as are their targets, but the nature of the far right is changing, and we need to understand that. Shouting Nazi and fascist at them won\u2019t be enough.</p> <p>\u2022 Joe Mulhall is senior researcher at <a href=\"https://www.hopenothate.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Hope Not Hate</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Over the past year there have been a number of far-right demonstrations in London, some of which have attracted as many as 10,000 people. Whether it was the Free Tommy Robinson event in July or the \u201cBrexit betrayal\u201d demonstration in December, the far right descended on the capital in numbers not seen in decades, perhaps not since the interwar period of the 1930s. The primary focus of this string of demonstrations has ranged from the imprisonment of anti-Muslim activist Robinson (real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon), to the supposed suppression of free speech (especially in regards to speaking about Muslims), and the perceived betrayal of the Brexit vote by politicians and elites. Similarly, 2019 has kicked off with a number of small \u201cyellow vest\u201d demonstrations, also focusing on Brexit. Despite the divergent range of issues, the demonstrations have, on the whole, been attended by the same group of people. Analysis by Hope Not Hate of the events found activists from across the far right, ranging from former English Defence League (EDL), Britain First and BNP activists to supporters of Generation Identity and Ukip and \u201calt-right\u201d figureheads \u2013 all happy to march shoulder to shoulder to protest about these various issues. In other words, something approaching a far-right popular front. However, those who held formal membership of traditional far-right organisations were outnumbered by those who had little or no formal affiliation, but who turned out regardless. This raises the question of why demonstrations in 2018, on a range of different issues, were attended by roughly the same group of non-aligned protesters. What were the common mobilising factors? Despite the eagerness of some to describe these demonstrations as fascist, they fit much more comfortably within political scientist Cas Mudde\u2019s definition of populism: \u201can ideology that considers society to be separated into two homogeneous and antagonistic groups, \u2018the pure people\u2019 versus \u2018the corrupt elite\u2019, and which argues that politics should be an expression of the volont\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale (general will) of the people.\u201d This current movement\u2019s binary distinction between the \u201cpure people\u201d and the \u201ccorrupt elite\u201d is why the accusation of \u201ctraitor\u201d is so readily thrown at any authority figure they disagree with, be they remain politicians or the judges who sentenced Robinson to prison. Those who disagree with their take on any issue are understood to be disagreeing with the will of the people. Though there were fascists in the crowds, the majority of the organisers and participants cannot accurately be described as fascists. On the whole, this angry mass of protestors lack a structured ideology and are driven much more by visceral emotions such as anger and betrayal. This is not to say that what starts as an emotional mobilisation cannot be increasingly politicised towards fascism. We saw this with the EDL, with many individuals starting out as single-issue activists then expanding their ideological outlook to a much more traditionally fascist platform over time. The fact that these demonstrators self-identify as \u201cthe people\u201d and have great antipathy towards supposed elites, could explain their reticence to have formal structures which necessitate hierarchies. Generally speaking, this is a movement with organisers, spokespeople and \u201cmartyrs\u201d rather than traditional leaders. While Robinson is an important figurehead for this movement, he has not sought to launch a formal vehicle, or adopt a formalised leadership position within it, as he did with the EDL and Pegida UK in the past. Similarly, in the wake of the yellow vests\u2019 harassment of Anna Soubry MP and others outside parliament in January, the press labelled James Goddard as the network\u2019s leader. Yet Goddard responded: \u201cThe #YellowVestsUK has no leader or political affiliation. They can\u2019t silence us all!\u201d The lack of formal leaders, however, does not mean they are directionless \u2013 merely that the rank and file looks to a range of far-right social-media influencers and the alternative media for direction rather than a formal leadership team. In recent years, we have seen the rise of disparate far-right social-media personalities who now have the ability to reach unprecedented numbers of people online. Together, the collection of post-organisational far-right influencers provide a veritable pick\u2019n\u2019mix of grievances for demonstrators to choose from \u2013 each mutually reinforcing the overarching sense that the system is rigged against them. How long this movement can continue as a shapeless and leaderless mass of angry people is difficult to say. It is of course possible that it could solidify into a more formalised movement under the leadership of Lennon, or within Ukip, which has embraced the far right under Gerard Batten. With trust in politicians and our political system at a low point, there is a ready pool of people who could be attracted to this type of messaging. Whatever happens with Brexit there is bound to be a narrative of betrayal being advanced by the far right that will likely speak to large numbers of people in the UK and reinforce existing disillusionment. Regardless, we cannot wait for a traditional, united, far-right umbrella organisation to emerge before we act. We need to start connecting the dots now and to realise that what we\u2019ve seen over the last year is various incarnations of the same threat. The modern British far right is a hydra, making it harder to combat in a traditional sense. If one prominent activist or leader falls from grace, it is no longer the fatal blow it once was, as others rapidly emerge to fill the void. The hate might be the same as before, as are their targets, but the nature of the far right is changing, and we need to understand that. Shouting Nazi and fascist at them won\u2019t be enough. \u2022 Joe Mulhall is senior researcher at Hope Not Hate",

      "body": "<p>The night\u2019s first visitor to the Safe Haven \u2013 a Peugeot ambulance with twin sick bays, parked in the shadow of the St Nicholas cathedral \u2013 is carried in by friends around 10.30pm. He is unable to walk, although at regular intervals he is able to throw up some of the bottle of rum he has just drunk.</p> <p>The St John Ambulance team here in Newcastle see dozens of these men and women every night: a head laceration on a rough sleeper, a student who thinks she broke a tooth when a friend accidentally closed a door on her, a German couple concerned about a man tottering precariously close to the edge of the High Level Bridge.</p> <p>The common denominator? Alcohol, and in due course the patients are walked 20 yards to a second van nearby that has been converted to take eight seats, and has sick bowls and wet wipes. Under the supervision of two police officers the patients are given time to sober up, charge their phones, contact friends or family, and get taxis home.</p> <p>One of the officers has worked the city centre beat for 16 years. \u201cBabysitting drunk kids didn\u2019t used to be our job,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the focus these days is on people\u2019s safety.\u201d</p> <p>Some surveys suggest a recent trend towards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/11/young-people-drunk-acohol-millenials\">more moderate drinking</a> among younger people, but on tonight\u2019s evidence, there are still plenty who enjoy a drink. The crew will assess and treat more than 50 people by sunrise.</p> <p>\u201cThere are drinkers who know they\u2019ve had enough, those who don\u2019t, and those who do but carry on,\u201d says Daryen Lemmon, clinical operations manager of the North East Ambulance Service, which runs the Safe Haven in partnership with St John and the Northumbria police and crime commissioner.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re the dangerous ones, and the challenge is to make them understand that they are vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>The Safe Haven is designed to help tackle that challenge, relieving pressure on Newcastle\u2019s stretched police and hospital resources. Five years ago, before it was introduced, A&amp;E waiting rooms and police station receptions were stuffed on weekend nights. Similar safe havens are in operation in Bristol and Cardiff.

Nevertheless, 60% of violent crime at those times remains alcohol-related, and that period saw 713 incidents of alcohol-related violence result in injury.</p> <p>The city of Liverpool reckons its economic cost from misuse of alcohol at around \u00a3750m a year. In January this year it opened a Centre for Alcohol Research, but it faces the same dilemma as Newcastle and others seeking to reduce harm from alcohol: how to regenerate city centres without it? Central government funding to Newcastle will have fallen by \u00a3282m in the 10 years to 2020. Licensed premises are some of the city\u2019s most successful remaining businesses.</p> <p>The rules are skewed towards the interests of Big Alcohol, says Colin Shevills, director of the north-east campaign group Balance.</p> <p>\u201cAt the centre of the [2003] Licensing Act is a presumption to approve an alcohol licence, unless you can prove that damage is going to emanate from that particular location \u2013 and that\u2019s very difficult to prove,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Indeed, more than nine out of 10 applications for licences \u2013 many of them for high-volume \u201cvertical-drinking\u201d bars \u2013 are being approved, even in \u201ccumulative impact zones\u201d, areas that cities have already identified as saturated. In Newcastle the number of licensed premises continues to rise, not fall, from 1,165 in 2013 to 1,197 now. Each pays as much as \u00a31,000 for a licence. To a cash-strapped city, alcohol is a much-needed source of revenue.</p> <p>The extended drinking hours introduced by the Licensing Act were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/20/opening-hours-binge-drinking\">aimed at bringing \u201ccontinental\u201d-style caf\u00e9 culture to England</a>: according to a slogan of the time, \u201cBologna in Birmingham, Madrid in Manchester, why not?\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>A decade later, the government devolved responsibility for drugs and alcohol treatment services to local authorities, leaving cities to pick up the bill. Subsequent austerity cuts meant places like Newcastle could no longer afford to pay for dedicated alcohol services, which are now merged with drugs treatment services. At least 41 English hospitals do not currently have an alcohol care team.</p> <p>The government\u2019s toothless approach to alcohol contrasts with its aggressive targeting of Big Tobacco, which has seen it restrict the sales of cigarettes and all but banish advertising. That would be tricky to do with booze. Much of the night-time economy is run by the alcohol industry. Night-time mayors typically have backgrounds in nightclubs or licensed premises: in London, for example, the current chair of the Night Time Commission, Kate Nicholls, is also the CEO of UK Hospitality; her vice chair is a director of the Drinkaware Trust, which is funded largely by donations from UK alcohol producers, retailers and supermarkets.</p> <p>The UK government receives more than \u00a310.7bn a year from alcohol in excise duty. Shevills believes cities could benefit if the government raised that duty, and quotes figures published by his organisation that nearly half (49%) of people in the north-east support higher alcohol taxes if the money goes into public services affected by alcohol use, such as the NHS and police. A cross-party parliamentary group recently published an \u201calcohol charter\u201d, calling for alcohol duties to rise enough to provide \u00a3100m of new money for treatment services.</p> <p>And yet with alcohol cheaper than ever \u2013 it is 60% more affordable than it was in 1980 \u2013 some cities might also benefit from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/27/scotland-minimum-alcohol-pricing-mixed-emotions\">minimum unit pricing</a>, which might also tackle the \u201cpre-loading\u201d habit of tanking up at home on supermarket-bought booze before catching a cab into town at 11pm. The number of convenience stores selling alcohol in cities has more than doubled over the last decade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc116f404eb792e2d6a2ada06d7ab272a4aabfdb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc116f404eb792e2d6a2ada06d7ab272a4aabfdb/0_56_1700_1020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People enjoy themselves in Newcastle on the night the drinking laws are relaxed, Wednesday 23 November 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People enjoy themselves in Newcastle on the night the drinking laws are relaxed, Wednesday 23 November 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Restricting advertising is another option. In the US, several cities already ban alcohol ads on public transport, including New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. \u201cHistory has shown us is that when restrictions and bans were placed on tobacco sponsorship, other companies come in and fill the advertising void,\u201d says Shevills.</p> <p>But the alcohol industry, like Big Tobacco before it, is resilient and resourceful, and unlikely to give up control of cities without a fight. Lobbying in Chicago, Charlotte and Washington DC, for example, has recently overturned bans on alcohol advertising on public transit.</p> <p>Likewise, in another Newcastle \u2013 the one in New South Wales, Australia \u2013 \u201clockout\u201d laws that have halved alcohol-related assaults are under constant attack. Local activist Tony Brown says the city centre used to be a no-go zone at night, held hostage by the \u201cthree Vs: violence, vandalism and vomit\u201d.</p> <p>The solution he and fellow campaigners spearheaded scaled back trading hours in the central business district to 3am, and licensed premises were barred from admitting anyone after 1am. He says those changes have led to a 72% reduction in reported alcohol non-domestic assaults in the central business district, and have also boosted the night-time economy, with the number of smaller licensed premises \u2013 restaurants and smaller bars \u2013 more than doubling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/20/opening-hours-binge-drinking\">How British \u2018cafe culture\u2019 drinks revolution ended in failure</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet New South Wales\u2019s Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority is under sustained lobbying to roll back the changes, in spite of evidence of what can happen when licensing hours are relaxed.</p> <p>\u201cWe had this whole narrative going on, which is common internationally, that the blame was all about the young people themselves.

This is a dominant mono-narrative about blaming young people.</p> <p>\u201cOur cities must disentangle themselves from the industry and escape from the notion that the unfettered availability and supply of alcohol is a prerequisite for the development and sustainability of the night-time economy.

      "bodyText": "The night\u2019s first visitor to the Safe Haven \u2013 a Peugeot ambulance with twin sick bays, parked in the shadow of the St Nicholas cathedral \u2013 is carried in by friends around 10.30pm. He is unable to walk, although at regular intervals he is able to throw up some of the bottle of rum he has just drunk. The St John Ambulance team here in Newcastle see dozens of these men and women every night: a head laceration on a rough sleeper, a student who thinks she broke a tooth when a friend accidentally closed a door on her, a German couple concerned about a man tottering precariously close to the edge of the High Level Bridge. The common denominator? Alcohol, and in due course the patients are walked 20 yards to a second van nearby that has been converted to take eight seats, and has sick bowls and wet wipes. Under the supervision of two police officers the patients are given time to sober up, charge their phones, contact friends or family, and get taxis home. One of the officers has worked the city centre beat for 16 years. \u201cBabysitting drunk kids didn\u2019t used to be our job,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the focus these days is on people\u2019s safety.\u201d Some surveys suggest a recent trend towards more moderate drinking among younger people, but on tonight\u2019s evidence, there are still plenty who enjoy a drink. The crew will assess and treat more than 50 people by sunrise. \u201cThere are drinkers who know they\u2019ve had enough, those who don\u2019t, and those who do but carry on,\u201d says Daryen Lemmon, clinical operations manager of the North East Ambulance Service, which runs the Safe Haven in partnership with St John and the Northumbria police and crime commissioner. \u201cThey\u2019re the dangerous ones, and the challenge is to make them understand that they are vulnerable.\u201d The Safe Haven is designed to help tackle that challenge, relieving pressure on Newcastle\u2019s stretched police and hospital resources. Five years ago, before it was introduced, A&amp;E waiting rooms and police station receptions were stuffed on weekend nights. Similar safe havens are in operation in Bristol and Cardiff. In December, NHS England made \u00a3300,000 available for other cities to set up similar facilities over the festive period. But along the so-called Diamond Strip of Newcastle nightclubs, there is still plenty to keep police patrol cars, ambulances and street pastors busy as they rub shoulders with pushy promoters promising three trebles \u2013 three triple-shots of spirits, such as vodka or rum, with a mixer like Red Bull or orange \u2013 for little more than a fiver. Recent data shows the number of reported alcohol-related ambulance callouts in the city centre is rising, not falling. A University Hospital Galway study found that in some cities the percentage of A&amp;E patients with alcohol-related injuries can rise to 30% at weekends. Newcastle\u2019s council, health and police chiefs are doing more than most to minimise the damage. Yet while Big Tobacco is on the retreat, alcohol still runs freely through Britain\u2019s cities. * * * Post-industrial cities such as Newcastle, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Nottingham dominate the latest Which? University rankings of best cities for nightlife. They have some of the highest densities of pubs and bars per sq km, and the most recent Public Health England figures suggest those densities are increasing every year \u2013 and much faster than the national average. Those same cities tend also to be the ones with the highest rates of alcohol-related injuries. Those rates are increasing, too \u2013 again, at a rate faster than the national average. A University of Sheffield study published in August found that places with the most pubs, bars and nightclubs had a 13% higher hospital admission rate for acute conditions caused by alcohol than places with the lowest density of such establishments.

Now keen to shed the image it gained as a stag and hen party destination of alcoholic excess \u2013 amplified to the world through the MTV reality show Geordie Shore \u2013 the city introduced a new licensing strategy last year that seeks to prove its night-time economy is about more than just alcohol. In neighbourhoods with the most licensed premises, the council is encouraging operators to move towards a more mixed offer: more restaurants, more bars with seating, more family-oriented attractions. Bars along the city\u2019s Georgian Grey Street have accepted a voluntary minimum unit pricing of 50p.

That same year, a 20-year-old Newcastle University student died from excessive alcohol during an Agric Society initiation ceremony. The school and other universities in the city have since intervened, encouraging freshers\u2019 week organisers to plan as many \u201cgrub crawls\u201d as pub crawls. Meanwhile, a drugs bust and forced closure of three adjoining late-night bars on the Diamond Strip in 2017 has led to clampdowns on club-night promoters, who could soon become licensed and regulated in the same way as bouncers and door staff. \u201cPolice budgets have shrunk, so I\u2019ve got to work differently,\u201d says Ch Insp Dave Pickett, who is responsible for Newcastle city centre. \u201cOne of my sons is 13 now, so in the not-too-distant future he\u2019ll be wanting to go out with his friends and I want to know he\u2019ll be looked after, not left abandoned on a night out.\u201d He says his methods are working.

The extended drinking hours introduced by the Licensing Act were aimed at bringing \u201ccontinental\u201d-style caf\u00e9 culture to England: according to a slogan of the time, \u201cBologna in Birmingham, Madrid in Manchester, why not?\u201d * * * A decade later, the government devolved responsibility for drugs and alcohol treatment services to local authorities, leaving cities to pick up the bill. Subsequent austerity cuts meant places like Newcastle could no longer afford to pay for dedicated alcohol services, which are now merged with drugs treatment services. At least 41 English hospitals do not currently have an alcohol care team. The government\u2019s toothless approach to alcohol contrasts with its aggressive targeting of Big Tobacco, which has seen it restrict the sales of cigarettes and all but banish advertising. That would be tricky to do with booze. Much of the night-time economy is run by the alcohol industry. Night-time mayors typically have backgrounds in nightclubs or licensed premises: in London, for example, the current chair of the Night Time Commission, Kate Nicholls, is also the CEO of UK Hospitality; her vice chair is a director of the Drinkaware Trust, which is funded largely by donations from UK alcohol producers, retailers and supermarkets. The UK government receives more than \u00a310.7bn a year from alcohol in excise duty. Shevills believes cities could benefit if the government raised that duty, and quotes figures published by his organisation that nearly half (49%) of people in the north-east support higher alcohol taxes if the money goes into public services affected by alcohol use, such as the NHS and police. A cross-party parliamentary group recently published an \u201calcohol charter\u201d, calling for alcohol duties to rise enough to provide \u00a3100m of new money for treatment services. And yet with alcohol cheaper than ever \u2013 it is 60% more affordable than it was in 1980 \u2013 some cities might also benefit from minimum unit pricing, which might also tackle the \u201cpre-loading\u201d habit of tanking up at home on supermarket-bought booze before catching a cab into town at 11pm. The number of convenience stores selling alcohol in cities has more than doubled over the last decade. Restricting advertising is another option. In the US, several cities already ban alcohol ads on public transport, including New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. \u201cHistory has shown us is that when restrictions and bans were placed on tobacco sponsorship, other companies come in and fill the advertising void,\u201d says Shevills. But the alcohol industry, like Big Tobacco before it, is resilient and resourceful, and unlikely to give up control of cities without a fight. Lobbying in Chicago, Charlotte and Washington DC, for example, has recently overturned bans on alcohol advertising on public transit. Likewise, in another Newcastle \u2013 the one in New South Wales, Australia \u2013 \u201clockout\u201d laws that have halved alcohol-related assaults are under constant attack. Local activist Tony Brown says the city centre used to be a no-go zone at night, held hostage by the \u201cthree Vs: violence, vandalism and vomit\u201d. The solution he and fellow campaigners spearheaded scaled back trading hours in the central business district to 3am, and licensed premises were barred from admitting anyone after 1am. He says those changes have led to a 72% reduction in reported alcohol non-domestic assaults in the central business district, and have also boosted the night-time economy, with the number of smaller licensed premises \u2013 restaurants and smaller bars \u2013 more than doubling. And yet New South Wales\u2019s Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority is under sustained lobbying to roll back the changes, in spite of evidence of what can happen when licensing hours are relaxed. \u201cWe had this whole narrative going on, which is common internationally, that the blame was all about the young people themselves. It really pissed me off from a social equity view,\u201d says Brown. \u201cNo one was ever talking about political responsibility or the industry\u2019s responsibility. This is a dominant mono-narrative about blaming young people. \u201cOur cities must disentangle themselves from the industry and escape from the notion that the unfettered availability and supply of alcohol is a prerequisite for the development and sustainability of the night-time economy. Our city has proven otherwise.\u201d For the rest, as any addict knows, the first step to recovery is admitting they have a problem.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Sanders calls on supporters to help \u2018complete the revolution\u2019 Bernie Sanders is running for president again. In an email on Tuesday morning, Sanders called on supporters to help him complete his \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d. But the independent senator from Vermont, who energised the left and came close to claiming the Democratic nomination from Hillary Clinton in 2016, faces a far more crowded field for 2020. While his name recognition instantly makes him a top-tier candidate, the 77-year-old must compete for progressive votes with several others who share his views on Medicare for all, the minimum wage and other issues. Hypothetical frontrunners. Recent hypothetical 2020 polls have consistently put Sanders ahead of Donald Trump and other declared Democratic candidates, though Joe Biden and Beto O\u2019Rourke \u2013 both yet to declare \u2013 also score highly. Rod Rosenstein expected to stand down in March Rod Rosenstein, the embattled US deputy attorney general, who in 2017 appointed Robert Mueller to investigate links between the Trump campaign and Russia, will stand down by mid-March as the new attorney general, William Barr, takes charge of the Justice Department. Rosenstein first made headlines for drafting the memo used by Trump to justify the firing of FBI director James Comey. Last year it was reported that he had suggested enlisting cabinet members to invoke the 25th amendment. \u2018So many lies\u2019. Trump attacked the former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe on Twitter again on Monday, following McCabe\u2019s 60 Minutes interview, in which he said Trump had ordered Rosenstein to write the memo justifying Comey\u2019s firing. Isis wife wants to help deradicalise other Americans Hoda Muthana, an Alabama woman who joined Isis in 2015 but says she deeply regrets the decision and wishes to return home, could help the US to dissuade others from becoming radicalised, her lawyer has said. The 24-year-old, who has a one-year-old son, is the only American among an estimated 1,500 foreign women and children at the vast al-Hawl refugee camp in northern Syria. In today\u2019s podcast, the Guardian\u2019s Martin Chulov describes his time at the camp, where he met and interviewed Muthana. Turkish threat. The Syrian Kurdish leader Ilham Ahmed has called for international observers to be stationed at the Syrian-Turkish border to protect Kurds from the threat of crimes against humanity by Turkish forces. Sixteen states sue Trump administration over border wall A coalition of 16 US states has launched a legal challenge against the Trump administration, over the president\u2019s decision to declare a national emergency to fund a wall on the US-Mexico border. The lawsuit was filed on Monday in the US district court for the northern district of California, after the Golden State\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, described the emergency declaration as a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d. Trump vs Maduro. Speaking about the crisis in Venezuela at a rally in Miami on Monday, Trump urged the country\u2019s military to ditch president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in favour of opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3, warning that otherwise they will \u201close everything\u201d. Crib sheet The leader of the UK\u2019s leftwing Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn, has been urged to change direction after seven of his MPs quit to form a new independent movement in Parliament. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s top adviser, Gerald Butts, has resigned amid a widening corruption scandal, despite denying allegations that he pressured Canada\u2019s former attorney general not to prosecute the engineering firm SNC-Lavalin. George Mendonsa, the \u201ckissing sailor\u201d photographed by Alfred Eisenstaedt in Times Square during celebrations at the end of the second world war, has died aged 95. The woman in the famous photo, Greta Friedman, died in 2016. New York City has banned discrimination based on hairstyles, with what is thought to be the first such regulation in the US. The new policy gives African Americans the legal right to wear their hair in afros, cornrows, Bantu knots and other styles. Must-reads Is it too late to break the palm oil habit? Palm oil is a miracle ingredient for modern life, found in biscuits, ice cream, biofuel, lipstick and shampoo. But our rapacious appetite for the fruit of the oil palm tree has brought environmental devastation to Malaysia and Indonesia, as Paul Tullis reports. What cowboys talk about when they talk about politics At the annual National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nevada, Carson Vaughan listened in as a group of cowboys discussed their differing views on climate change, immigration and other issues, \u201cwithout demonising each other\u201d. How Office Space spoke to an anxious workplace From Fight Club to The Matrix, 1999 produced a bumper crop of movies in which angry, ordinary men threw off the shackles of society. But Charles Bramesco says the truest hero of the time was Peter Gibbons, the deskbound protagonist of Office Space. Tiny sculptures made from New York City trash Yuji Agematsu has spent more than 20 years collecting trash from the streets of New York City and turning it into tiny dioramas. A collection of his work from 2017 is now showing at the Carnegie International exhibition in Pittsburgh. Opinion When it comes to defeating Trump, says Nathan Robinson, nobody comes close to Bernie Sanders, who has beaten the president in polls since 2016. But Robert Reich argues that Sanders\u2019 success in driving Democrats to the left could prove his greatest weakness: he\u2019s no longer the only progressive in the race. He showed Democrats they could run successfully on policies like Medicare for all, free public higher education and higher taxes on the wealthy \u2013 instead of the cautious \u201cnew Democrat\u201d centrism of Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry and Barack Obama. Bernie Sanders put \u201cprogressive\u201d back into the Democratic party of Franklin D Roosevelt. Sport The figure skater Alysa Liu is a US champion at just 13 years old. Is that too young to devote oneself to elite sport, and the mental and physical strains that come with it, asks Kristen Doerer. Manchester United made up for their loss to Chelsea in last year\u2019s FA Cup final with a confident 2-0 victory over the holders in Monday\u2019s fifth-round clash at Stamford Bridge, which left Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri facing jeers from his club\u2019s own fans.

Sport in general has been mined recently, with athleisure and sporty tracksuits now commonplace. Watersports are a logical progression, meaning wetsuits could make their way to dry land this spring. London brand House of Holland certainly waved the blue flag for surf with long-sleeved bodysuits \u2013 a collaboration with Speedo \u2013 and rash guard tops designed to evoke a second skin. \u201cThe narrative behind the collection was the increasing intensity of everyday life. Women\u2019s outfits need to cater to more than one thing at a time and what they wear has to have duality,\u201d says designer Henry Holland, who styled surfer-girl pieces with tailoring and party dresses. If the full look isn\u2019t your thing, test the waters with beach bags, bucket hats and shield sunglasses. \u201cIt\u2019s about a new wave of city dressing \u2013 people aren\u2019t willing to be uncomfortable any more,\u201d says Holland, pointing out that, \u201cthese days, the notion of the beach being your office is not a weird concept.\u201d",

Welch has cut her hours at work to help cope. \u201cThere are different sessions: high-intensity sessions, sprint sessions, strength sessions. Over seven days a week you\u2019ve got to do six different sessions, so unless you double up you\u2019ve got to work out every day to maintain the fitness levels.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Getting that balance is the biggest challenge. \u201cWe have four referees in the women\u2019s game who only do women\u2019s football; all the others do the men\u2019s game too,\u201d Stimpson says. \u201cMost have jobs, most have families.\u201d</p> \n<p>Showing the realities faced by amateur or part-time referees helps sow understanding, but Stimpson is mindful of dwelling on their status too much: \u201cThere\u2019s a perception of them not being good enough.

They also impinge on the legally binding Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland and in some senses pooled sovereignty of Northern Ireland giving people a birthright to be Irish or British or both.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>If the UK leaves the EU along with the customs union and the single market then the border in Ireland becomes the only land border between the UK and the EU forcing customs, tax and regulatory controls.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The backstop is one of three options agreed by the EU and the UK in December and would only come into play if option A (overall agreement) or option B (a tailor-made solution) cannot be agreed by the end of transition. The Irish have likened it to an insurance policy.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The new EU idea is to extend the transition period to allow time to get to option A or B.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>But an extension is problematic for Brexiters and leave voters, who want the UK to get out of the EU as soon as possible.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>The Irish and the EU will also still need the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, which must be signed before the business of the trade deal can get under way. Otherwise it is&nbsp; a no-deal Brexit.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>Extending the transition into 2021 would mean another year of paying into the EU budget. Britain would have to negotiate this but it has been estimated at anywhere between \u00a310bn and \u00a317bn.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Staying in the EU for another year would also mean continued freedom of movement and being under the&nbsp;European court of justice, which Brexiters would oppose.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Of the British calls for a renegotiation, Roth said there was \u201cno point in abstractly demanding changes or to make demands, which are completely unacceptable for us\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cThere can be no limit to the backstop, there can\u2019t be an automatic expiration of the backstop.

Quinta de Azevedo Vinho Verde Portugal 2017 (from \u00a37.99, Majestic; Waitrose) Clocking in at a mere 11.5% alcohol, this classic northern Portuguese white doesn\u2019t stint on flavour or aroma, positively bursting with exotic fruit salad flavours and zesty acidity dovetailing beautifully with crisp, crunchy veggie dishes. Bodegas Hidalgo La Gitana Manzanilla Spain NV (from \u00a38, Sainsbury\u2019s, Majestic, Waitrose) The lightest, freshest style of sherry from the town of Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda has a subtle sea-salty tang, fresh sourdough bread and Marmite-lite nutty-yeasty savouriness that make it incredibly moreish both with and without olives and jam\u00f3n. Adventurous weekend wines: red Andr\u00e9 &amp; Michel Quenard Chignin Mondeuse Tradition Savoie, France 2017 (\u00a318, robersonwine.com) From the lesser-known Alpine French wine region, this idiosyncratic but deliciously vivid red has a finger-staining black cherry and blackberry colour and flavour, spiced up with a shake of the pepper pot and keen acidity. Orgo Saperavi Kakheti, Georgia 2017 (from \u00a319.99, butlers-winecellar.co.uk; hedonism.co.uk) Georgia, the oldest winemaking country, has become one of the world\u2019s most fashionable in recent years, with small producers reviving traditional methods and local varieties in deep, dark, powerful but suave and spicy reds such as this. Zorzal Eggo Franco Cabernet Franc Tupungato, Uco Valley, Mendoza, Argentina 2017 (from \u00a315.29, strictlywine.co.uk; hic-winemerchants.com) The Michelini brothers are behind some of Argentina\u2019s most elegant red wines, working here with trendy concrete eggs rather than wooden barrels to produce something beautifully pure and focused, with freshening leafy notes and bright blackcurrant. Etienne Suzzoni Clos Culombu Corse Calvi Rouge Corsica, France 2016 (from \u00a316.60, hhandc.co.uk; josephbarneswines.com; smilinggrape.com) A mingling of Italian and southern French winemaking influences and grape varieties (led by Tuscan favourite sangiovese, known here as niellucio), this deep, structured, resonant red is alive with Mediterranean red and black fruit, herbs and spice. Adventurous weekend wines: white and fizz Eva Fricke Riesling Trocken Rheingau, Germany 2016 (from \u00a316, pinotandchardo.co.uk; bbr.com; hic-winemerchants.com; laywheeler.com) A rising star in modern German wine, Eva Fricke has a real feel for riesling, here unleashing a laser-guided dry white with a spine of steel and flashes of succulent lime and stone fruit. Exhilarating. Silwervis \u201cSmiley\u201d Chenin Blanc Swartland, South Africa NV (from \u00a318.50, shop.vinoteca.co.uk; handford.net) Something funkily different from Swartland, the creative hub of South African wine: a natural blend of sauvignon blanc and chenin blanc from four different vintages, a textured, complex, living mouthful of orangey zing, apricot and nuts. Mylonas Winery Malagouzia Keratea, Attica, Greece 2017 (\u00a313.60, maltbyandgreek.com) Rediscovered in the 1990s, malagouzia is Greece\u2019s answer to viognier, making full-flavoured, beguilingly aromatic white wines with, in this case, an evocative scent of dill-like herb, stone-fruit richness and fluent, ocean-breezy acidity. Royal Tokaji, The Oddity Tokaji, Hungary 2014 (from \u00a313.01, corneyandbarrow.com; eynshamcellars.com) A region best known for its legendary sweet wines has been paying increasing attention to dry whites. Based, as here, on the furmint variety, they offer an arresting combination of febrile acidity and full-bodied exotic fruitiness. Muga Conde de Haro Cava Brut Spain 2016 (\u00a313.50, thewinesociety.com; Waitrose) The overwhelming majority of cava comes from Catalonia, but you can find small amounts produced elsewhere in Spain, and this harmonious, high-quality fizz from Rioja\u2019s Muga is certainly no mere novelty: creamy but lithe and fresh. Casa Belfi Col Fondo Prosecco Italy 2017 (from \u00a315.56, josephbarneswines.com; haywines.co.uk) Col fondo is prosecco, but not as we usually know it: unfiltered, it has a cloudy appearance, a much fuller, rounder, multifaceted texture, and lots of wild and bright fruit and yeasty flavour, making for a richly satisfying, food-friendly experience. Special occasion wines: red Niepoort Lagar de Baixo Bairrada, Portugal 2015 (from \u00a321.95, vincognito.co.uk; handford.net) Portugal\u2019s greatest winemaker, Dirk Niepoort, is the scion of a port family in the Douro valley, where he also makes magical reds. This, however, is the utterly gorgeous, elegant, burgundy-esque fruit of a project in Bairrada: a gossamer gem. L\u00f3pez de Heredia Vi\u00f1a Tondonia Tinto Rioja Reserva Rioja, Spain 2005 (from \u00a327.95, Waitrose, www.bbr.com; nywines.co.uk; robersonwine.com) From a great traditionalist producer, a beautiful, unusually graceful old-school rioja with silken texture and flavours of still-perky red berry fruit mingling with the mature savouriness and leatheriness that come from 13 years of ageing in barrel and bottle. Kooyong Massale Pinot Noir Mornington Peninsula, Victoria, Australia 2017 (from \u00a321.95, nywines.co.uk; greatwesternwine.co.uk; bottleapostle.com) The Mornington Peninsula in Victoria has become one of the world\u2019s best places for making pinot noir. In pinot terms, this lucid, fluent example, with its fine, feathery feel and focused red berry fruit and lingering fresh finish, is excellent value, too. Sadie Family Soldaat Grenache Olifants River, South Africa 2017 (from \u00a339.50, harrogatefinewinecompany.com; nywines.co.uk; hedonism.co.uk) Another miraculous wine from the visionary Cape genius Eben Sadie, this is the generally plush, warm-climate variety grenache at its most aromatic and ethereal, combining lightness of touch with concentration of flavour: a masterpiece. Domaine Christophe Curtat Syrah Ard\u00e8che, France 2016 (\u00a324, bottleapostle.com) Though it uses the lesser Ard\u00e8che appellation, this deep and sinewy syrah from the northern Rh\u00f4ne Valley has all the class and distinctive characteristics \u2013 pepper-scented meatiness, black olive, almost floral perfume \u2013 of a big-name appellation, but at a lesser price. Special occasion wines: white, fizz and port Domaine Castera Tauzy Juran\u00e7on France 2016 (\u00a326, swig.co.uk) From a great, historic if somewhat overlooked appellation in the foothills of the Pyrenees, a super-complex dry white blend that will knock your socks off with its combination of citrus tang, Toblerone-style honeyed nuttiness, exotic fruit and minerals. Fefi\u00f1anes Albari\u00f1o R\u00edas Baixas, Spain 2017 (from \u00a316.50, thewinesociety.com; uncorked.co.uk; martinez.co.uk) Year in, year out, Fefi\u00f1anes produces the world\u2019s finest albari\u00f1o, a never-less-than-mouthwatering combination of Atlantic spray salty freshness, apple blossom and pristine stone fruit for a smart and scintillating match for seafood. Marcel et Blanche F\u00e8vre Chablis 1er Cru Vaulorent France 2016 (from \u00a328, tanners-wines.co.uk; southdowncellars.co.uk; standrewswinecompany.com) An object lesson in the crystalline style of chardonnay from the Chablis district of northern Burgundy with a mid-palate swell of ripe golden fruit and a moreish mineral finish to transform your fish supper into a Michelin-starred meal. Champagne Tarlant R\u00e9serve Champagne, France NV (\u00a325, laywheeler.com) From a leading producer in Champagne\u2019s burgeoning grower-producer movement, this is a special-occasion fizz at a supermarket price, refined and silky with a burst of apple and Danish pastry and a swish of needlepoint acidity. Barbeito Single Harvest Madeira 2004 (\u00a322.95, 50cl, slurp.co.uk; thewhiskyexchange.com; uncorked.co.uk) There is no better way to finish a meal than with a bottle of the rich but strangely refreshing Portuguese island fortified such as Barbeito\u2019s with its luminous acidity, raisins and candied peel in honey, nuts and baking spice. Wines to lay down: red Domaine de la Butte Bourgueil Mi-Pente, Loire, France 2016 (\u00a324.30, justerinis.com) Top Loire cabernet franc, such as this deep, fragnant, cassis-infused beauty from Jacky Blot, has the appeal and ageability of the fresher end of top Bordeaux, but at a fraction of the price for the equivalent quality. Rippon Mature Vine Pinot Noir Wanaka, Central Otago, New Zealand 2014 (\u00a339.25, leaandsandeman.co.uk) The finest pinot noir producer in New Zealand? Rippon\u2019s pinots are among the finest anywhere, with a slinkiness of texture, brightness of fruit and a characteristic Central Otago wild herbiness that will only improve with time. Domaine Berthaut-Gerbet Fixin Burgundy, France 2016 (\u00a328.09, stannarywine.com) A rising-star winemaker (Am\u00e9lie Berthaut) working in one of the region\u2019s less celebrated villages (Fixin) is a recipe for (relative) value among the stratospheric prices of top Burgundy: deliciously refined and pure now or over the next decade. Domaine de l\u2019A C\u00f4tes de Castillon, Bordeaux, France 2014 (\u00a339.95, bbr.com) As with Burgundy, so with Bordeaux: look to the fringes (in this case Castillon) and a great winemaker (St\u00e9phane Derenoncourt), rather than a big name, to find fine, classically styled, long-lived claret for a relatively reasonable price. GD Vajra Barolo Le Albe Piedmont, Italy 2014 (from \u00a335.99, rannochscott.co.uk; laywheeler.com; etonvintners.com; hedonism.co.uk) Unlike many Barolo, GD Vajra\u2019s don\u2019t have to be aged before the tannins soften enough to make them drinkable; its floral cherry charm is gorgeous now. Come to it in a decade, however, and it will be even more enchanting. Wines to lay down: white, sweet, fizz and port Tyrrell\u2019s Vat 1 Semillon 2011 Hunter Valley, Australia 2011 (from \u00a331.99, farehamwinecellar.co.uk; hailshamcellars.com; noblegreenwines.co.uk) Many wines improve with age; few go through the radical metamorphosis of Hunter Valley Semillon: Tyrrell\u2019s classic is taut, lean, lemony and light in youth; over 10, 20 or 30 years, it will transform into a toasty, creamy wonder. The Society\u2019s Exhibition Riesling Alsace, France 2016 (\u00a314.50, thewinesociety.com) Made for The Wine Society by the incomparable Josmeyer, this is typically joyful, livewire, silky and dry right now; but it would be fun to see it take on extra caraway-seed complexity over the next five years. Les Carmes de Rieussec Sauternes Bordeaux, France 2015 (\u00a325.95, leaandsandeman.co.uk; justerinis.com) In good vintages, the second wines of top Bordeaux ch\u00e2teaux are often superb (and, in the context, good value). In 2015, Ch\u00e2teau Rieussec\u2019s honey-drizzled, tropical-fruited dessert wine Les Carmes is a delight to set aside for Christmas in 2025. Co-op Les Pionniers Champagne Brut France NV (\u00a318.99, Co-op) Made by Piper Heidsieck, the Co-op\u2019s incomprehensibly good-value and consistent house Champagne is delightfully rich but balanced now, but will, like most champagnes, add still more flavour, while retaining its zip, if it\u2019s squirreled away for a year or two. Quinta do Noval Late Bottled Vintage Port Douro, Portugal 2012 (\u00a320.95, ocado.com) Late Bottled Vintage is a cheaper style of port designed to be drunk immediately; vintage port is the one that usually requires a decade or two to be at its best. When the producer is as good as Noval, however, the LBV can be safely stashed for five years or more.

      "body": "<p>In the late 1970s, while Brian Eno was imagining background melodies for baggage claim on his album Music for Airports, music for inanimate objects was also becoming big business in Japan with Get at the Wave, Takashi Kokubo\u2019s 1987 masterpiece given away with Sanyo air conditioning units, or Yasuaki Shimizu\u2019s selected ambient works for a Seiko watch advert.</p> <p>Bright, beautiful, unashamedly corporate pieces like these appear on <a href=\"https://lightintheattic.net/releases/4088-kankyo-ongaku-japanese-ambient-environmental-new-age-music-1980-1990\">Kanky\u014d Ongaku</a>, a new compilation of Japanese <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/11/festivals-ambient-brian-eno-farr-meakusma-bestival\">ambient music</a> from 1980 to 1990, when the influence of minimalist composers like Philip Glass and Terry Riley met a golden era for electronics. Kanky\u014d Ongaku (meaning environmental music) melded music and commerce, and turned lounge music into an art form.</p> <p>Traditional Japanese music has mirrored its surroundings for centuries \u2013 the shakuhachi, a seventh-century bamboo flute, was designed to play all 12 tones of the western chromatic scale as a way to give voice to nature\u2019s diversity. So in Japan\u2019s 1980s economic boom, when cities like Tokyo were mutating at warp speed and Roland synthesisers replaced the classical instrument, ambient was reflecting these new, hyper-advanced landscapes. \u201cTechnology was going through revolutionary changes, and all types of music were seeking out the synthesiser sound,\u201d says composer Kokubo.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGbLGNpdj18\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IGbLGNpdj18?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cIt was a special time where people interacted, created works together and shared them,\u201d says percussionist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/mar/24/midori-takada-interview-through-the-looking-glass-reissue\">Midori Takada</a>, whose debut album <a href=\"http://paltoflats.com/release/midori-takada-through-the-looking-glass/\">Through the Looking Glass</a> is considered a foundation stone of modern minimalism. \u201cI regard sound and physicality as materials, and the expansion of these sensations were based on the development of electronics.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen I discovered minimal music I felt I could create my vision \u2013 it was totally different to traditional music,\u201d says Mamoru Fujisawa, AKA Joe Hisaishi, considered by some as Japan\u2019s most accomplished composer. He leads orchestras \u2013 the active motions keep him fit at 68 \u2013 and as Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s go-to composer, Hisaishi scored Studio Ghibli\u2019s My Neighbour Totoro, Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. With Mkwaju Ensemble he made xylophone-techno club fodder and explored futuristic boogie with his album Curved Music. \u201cI felt confident this music would become the cutting edge in the future,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"abef1cdfacff3392ce2668f59e89e0fc8922c65a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abef1cdfacff3392ce2668f59e89e0fc8922c65a/0_0_931_1315/708.jpg\" alt=\"Satoshi Ashikawa.\" width=\"708\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Japanbient flag bearer ... Satoshi Ashikawa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sound Process</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Musicians quickly adopted early synthesisers like the Herbie Hancock-favoured Fairlight CMI. \u201cSynthesisers can be programmed with more imagination than a real, \u2018human\u2019 performance. It\u2019s a joyful thing,\u201d says Hisaishi, but the electronic instruments synthesisers were an expensive pursuit.</p> <p>Thankfully, Japanese corporations had more money than they could spend and government initiatives offered tax breaks for creative investment, so these companies pumped money into the arts. Musicians were given free reign. They weren\u2019t governed by corporate buzzwords, nor were they seen as selling out. \u201cIt was like a Renaissance style of funding, but instead of the king\u2019s coffers, it\u2019s a lingerie company,\u201d says Kanky\u014d Ongaku compiler Spencer Doran (whose work in electronic duo Visible Cloaks echoes this Japanese ambient music, and who has just collaborated with two composers from the original scene, Yoshio Ojima and Satsuki Shibano). The result? Imagine if the wispy John Lewis Christmas covers became adored relics that now <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/%E8%8A%A6%E5%B7%9D%E8%81%A1-Still-Way-Wave-Notation-2/release/3697547\">trade hands</a> for more than \u00a3300 a pop.</p> <p>Everyone from avant-gardists to chic metropolitan pop stars like Ryuichi Sakamoto were enticed by this liberating and lucrative business model, and Kanky\u014d Ongaku seeped into everyday life. Kokubo wrote emergency alerts for earthquake warning alarms (a piercing \u201cWee! Wee!\u201d sound is the optimum way to demand attention, apparently). Hiroshi Yoshimura\u2019s 1986 album <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MojW0fVaaFE\">Soundscape 1: Surround</a> was designed for urbanites touring the model houses of Misawa Homecorp, and Muji snapped up Yellow Magic Orchestra\u2019s Haruomi Hosono for their store playlist.</p> <p>Yoshio Ojima made avant-pop on primeval computers with 1983\u2019s Club, finding inspiration in \u201cfashion, advertisements, buildings and everything that was overflowing in Tokyo at the time\u201d. His album Music for Spiral was composed in 1988 for Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building when environmental music was booming. The Spiral was funded by the Wacoal lingerie company, who used the billions they earned selling bras to fund arts programmes and the would-be influential record label Newsic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d6e1a6a2a1b9b029d37ef15abc5e724d3fcf1b6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6e1a6a2a1b9b029d37ef15abc5e724d3fcf1b6f/0_0_3000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Environmental music ... the cover of the Kanky\u014d Ongaku compilation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Environmental music ... the cover of the Kanky\u014d Ongaku compilation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Light in the Attic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kanky\u014d Ongaku has mutated in the years since. Negicco (The Green Onion Girls) promote a type of onion found around Niigata with sugar rush teen pop. Sticking to the source material, though, is Chihei Hatakeyama, founder of ambient record label White Paddy Mountain. \u201cI do not find inspiration in the city,\u201d says Hatakeyama. \u201cAmbient music is a simple combination of sounds and timbres, and it has an affinity with traditional Japanese gardens or houses, the seasons, isolated places or formerly exiled islands like Hachij\u014d-jima.\u201d Ojima shares this connection with traditional culture, comparing environmental music to ikebana (Japanese flower arrangement): \u201ca flower that blooms at the roadside can be beautiful if arranged by someone with knowledge. This has always been in my mind when making ambient music.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the original Kanky\u014d Ongaku musicians are now in their 60s but they\u2019re still reaching fresh ears. \u201cThrough globalisation the world is unifying, but this music which comes from Japan will not change,\u201d says Takada. Shigeo Sekito\u2019s The Word II was sampled in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY8IS0ssnXQ\">Chamber of Reflection</a> by Mac DeMarco and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjgYedDt8G8\">How U Feel</a> by Travis Scott and Quavo, bringing Japanese ambient to unwitting teens at festivals. \u201cThis music is necessary [now] when you\u2019re living in a hyper-capitalist metropolis,\u201d says Doran on the revival, with Kokubo suggesting that \u201c30 years later, maybe it\u2019s finally being understood.\u201d</p> <p>But some of the composers are no longer with us. In 2015, Susumu Yokota, ambient mastermind of Acid Mt Fuji and Sakura, died at 54, and in 2003, Yoshimura died from skin cancer. \u201cHad Yoshimura already been in the ambient music canon when he was making records, he\u2019d be as highly regarded as Eno.\u201d says Doran.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/mar/24/midori-takada-interview-through-the-looking-glass-reissue\">Ambient pioneer Midori Takada: 'Everything on this earth has a sound'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the earliest flag bearers of what is also called Japanbient was Satoshi Ashikawa, who filled his record store with Stockhausen and broke ground with his environmental music label, Sound Process. But in 1983, aged 30, \u201cthe height of his career\u201d according to Doran, he was killed in a car accident. He was in the middle of recording a collaboration with piano experimentalist Satsuki Shibano, who says Ashikawa told her \u201cthe world of sound shouldn\u2019t be eroded by humans\u201d. The sound world of the Kanky\u014d Ongaku scene, thankfully, remains as strong as ever.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://lightintheattic.net/releases/4088-kankyo-ongaku-japanese-ambient-environmental-new-age-music-1980-1990\">Kanky\u014d Ongaku: Japanese Ambient, Environmental &amp; New Age Music 1980-1990</a> is out now on Light in the Attic. <br></p>",

      "bodyText": "In the late 1970s, while Brian Eno was imagining background melodies for baggage claim on his album Music for Airports, music for inanimate objects was also becoming big business in Japan with Get at the Wave, Takashi Kokubo\u2019s 1987 masterpiece given away with Sanyo air conditioning units, or Yasuaki Shimizu\u2019s selected ambient works for a Seiko watch advert. Bright, beautiful, unashamedly corporate pieces like these appear on Kanky\u014d Ongaku, a new compilation of Japanese ambient music from 1980 to 1990, when the influence of minimalist composers like Philip Glass and Terry Riley met a golden era for electronics. Kanky\u014d Ongaku (meaning environmental music) melded music and commerce, and turned lounge music into an art form. Traditional Japanese music has mirrored its surroundings for centuries \u2013 the shakuhachi, a seventh-century bamboo flute, was designed to play all 12 tones of the western chromatic scale as a way to give voice to nature\u2019s diversity. So in Japan\u2019s 1980s economic boom, when cities like Tokyo were mutating at warp speed and Roland synthesisers replaced the classical instrument, ambient was reflecting these new, hyper-advanced landscapes. \u201cTechnology was going through revolutionary changes, and all types of music were seeking out the synthesiser sound,\u201d says composer Kokubo. \u201cIt was a special time where people interacted, created works together and shared them,\u201d says percussionist Midori Takada, whose debut album Through the Looking Glass is considered a foundation stone of modern minimalism. \u201cI regard sound and physicality as materials, and the expansion of these sensations were based on the development of electronics.\u201d \u201cWhen I discovered minimal music I felt I could create my vision \u2013 it was totally different to traditional music,\u201d says Mamoru Fujisawa, AKA Joe Hisaishi, considered by some as Japan\u2019s most accomplished composer. He leads orchestras \u2013 the active motions keep him fit at 68 \u2013 and as Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s go-to composer, Hisaishi scored Studio Ghibli\u2019s My Neighbour Totoro, Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. With Mkwaju Ensemble he made xylophone-techno club fodder and explored futuristic boogie with his album Curved Music. \u201cI felt confident this music would become the cutting edge in the future,\u201d he says. Musicians quickly adopted early synthesisers like the Herbie Hancock-favoured Fairlight CMI. \u201cSynthesisers can be programmed with more imagination than a real, \u2018human\u2019 performance. It\u2019s a joyful thing,\u201d says Hisaishi, but the electronic instruments synthesisers were an expensive pursuit. Thankfully, Japanese corporations had more money than they could spend and government initiatives offered tax breaks for creative investment, so these companies pumped money into the arts. Musicians were given free reign. They weren\u2019t governed by corporate buzzwords, nor were they seen as selling out. \u201cIt was like a Renaissance style of funding, but instead of the king\u2019s coffers, it\u2019s a lingerie company,\u201d says Kanky\u014d Ongaku compiler Spencer Doran (whose work in electronic duo Visible Cloaks echoes this Japanese ambient music, and who has just collaborated with two composers from the original scene, Yoshio Ojima and Satsuki Shibano). The result? Imagine if the wispy John Lewis Christmas covers became adored relics that now trade hands for more than \u00a3300 a pop. Everyone from avant-gardists to chic metropolitan pop stars like Ryuichi Sakamoto were enticed by this liberating and lucrative business model, and Kanky\u014d Ongaku seeped into everyday life. Kokubo wrote emergency alerts for earthquake warning alarms (a piercing \u201cWee! Wee!\u201d sound is the optimum way to demand attention, apparently). Hiroshi Yoshimura\u2019s 1986 album Soundscape 1: Surround was designed for urbanites touring the model houses of Misawa Homecorp, and Muji snapped up Yellow Magic Orchestra\u2019s Haruomi Hosono for their store playlist. Yoshio Ojima made avant-pop on primeval computers with 1983\u2019s Club, finding inspiration in \u201cfashion, advertisements, buildings and everything that was overflowing in Tokyo at the time\u201d. His album Music for Spiral was composed in 1988 for Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building when environmental music was booming. The Spiral was funded by the Wacoal lingerie company, who used the billions they earned selling bras to fund arts programmes and the would-be influential record label Newsic. Kanky\u014d Ongaku has mutated in the years since. Negicco (The Green Onion Girls) promote a type of onion found around Niigata with sugar rush teen pop. Sticking to the source material, though, is Chihei Hatakeyama, founder of ambient record label White Paddy Mountain. \u201cI do not find inspiration in the city,\u201d says Hatakeyama. \u201cAmbient music is a simple combination of sounds and timbres, and it has an affinity with traditional Japanese gardens or houses, the seasons, isolated places or formerly exiled islands like Hachij\u014d-jima.\u201d Ojima shares this connection with traditional culture, comparing environmental music to ikebana (Japanese flower arrangement): \u201ca flower that blooms at the roadside can be beautiful if arranged by someone with knowledge. This has always been in my mind when making ambient music.\u201d Most of the original Kanky\u014d Ongaku musicians are now in their 60s but they\u2019re still reaching fresh ears. \u201cThrough globalisation the world is unifying, but this music which comes from Japan will not change,\u201d says Takada. Shigeo Sekito\u2019s The Word II was sampled in Chamber of Reflection by Mac DeMarco and How U Feel by Travis Scott and Quavo, bringing Japanese ambient to unwitting teens at festivals. \u201cThis music is necessary [now] when you\u2019re living in a hyper-capitalist metropolis,\u201d says Doran on the revival, with Kokubo suggesting that \u201c30 years later, maybe it\u2019s finally being understood.\u201d But some of the composers are no longer with us. In 2015, Susumu Yokota, ambient mastermind of Acid Mt Fuji and Sakura, died at 54, and in 2003, Yoshimura died from skin cancer. \u201cHad Yoshimura already been in the ambient music canon when he was making records, he\u2019d be as highly regarded as Eno.\u201d says Doran. One of the earliest flag bearers of what is also called Japanbient was Satoshi Ashikawa, who filled his record store with Stockhausen and broke ground with his environmental music label, Sound Process. But in 1983, aged 30, \u201cthe height of his career\u201d according to Doran, he was killed in a car accident. He was in the middle of recording a collaboration with piano experimentalist Satsuki Shibano, who says Ashikawa told her \u201cthe world of sound shouldn\u2019t be eroded by humans\u201d. The sound world of the Kanky\u014d Ongaku scene, thankfully, remains as strong as ever. \u2022 Kanky\u014d Ongaku: Japanese Ambient, Environmental &amp; New Age Music 1980-1990 is out now on Light in the Attic.",

      "body": "<p>Several weeks ahead of the 35th annual National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nevada, Gail Steiger, a rancher and singer-songwriter from Yavapai county, Arizona, emailed a proposal to a small host of close friends and fellow performers.</p> <p>\u201cNone of us fit easily in any box, but we all hold each other in high regard,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>\u201cIf we can\u2019t talk to each other about the future course of our country, who can?</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he added, \u201cwe could see if old friends can at least have a conversation about these issues without demonizing each other.\u201d</p> <p>Steiger was proposing a political rendezvous amongst friends \u2013 some Republicans, some Democrats, some in the wild, open range in between \u2013 who have largely avoided the subject for their more than 30-year history together.</p> <p>In other circles, Steiger\u2019s request may have seemed commonplace. At the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering, a weeklong festival of western poetry and song cherished by thousands for its cultivation of community, it was a perilous suggestion. More than a few performers, they say, have shot themselves in the foot proselytizing in Elko. Of the five poets Steiger initially invited to participate in his offsite roundtable, two respectfully declined.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91146bbef8f164e80c2cf44a56e6a3b53da4cfcf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91146bbef8f164e80c2cf44a56e6a3b53da4cfcf/0_0_2500_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Various silver items for sale at the 35th National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nev. on February 2, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Various silver items for sale at the 35th National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nevada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mikayla Whitmore/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rodeo poet Paul Zarzyski, a diehard liberal from Great Falls, Montana, was one of them.</p> <p>\u201cThese people are so locked in.

When I go back, I\u2019m going to be looking on Huffington Post in the morning. I\u2019m going to be watching MSNBC. I\u2019m going to be thrown right back in again and this is a little sanctuary for five or six days.\u201d</p> <p>The rest of them quietly gathered in the old Hotel West, the Basque steakhouse next door boisterous with tourists and townies, the blinking lights of Elko\u2019s tiny brothel district visible from the back door. They sat around a large dining room table, discussing climate change and immigration, passing the \u201ctalking stick\u201d back and forth and striving unsuccessfully \u2013 like newcomers to a board game \u2013 to follow the rigid guidelines of a Socratic dialogue: more questions, fewer opinions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8f624c2bb0f33e61549da87cc8c6f18483cb3c1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f624c2bb0f33e61549da87cc8c6f18483cb3c1f/0_0_2500_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gail Steiger poses for a portrait at the 35th National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nev. on February 1, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gail Steiger poses for a portrait at the 35th National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mikayla Whitmore/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Gail Steiger: the congressman\u2019s son</strong></h2> <p>The son of a rancher and five-term Arizona congressman, Gail Steiger grew up with \u201ca different brand of politics\u201d. He used to accompany his father Sam to the weekly meetings of the Arizona delegation, and though all but one of them were Republican, he says, the lone Democrat commanded equal respect at the table.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019d laugh about that, but they were friends! They would sit down and say, \u2018What is best for Arizona?\u2019 They really tried hard to do that.\u201d</p> <p>But he\u2019d never harbored any particular fantasy of a career in politics, not after watching the way it skewed so many simple encounters into perverse transactions, everyone \u201cblowing smoke\u201d to gain access to his father. After he dropped out of college to help run his father\u2019s Senate campaign in 1976, he shut the door on politics for good, suddenly all too aware of just how manipulative and hollow the enterprise could be. The final straw was an encounter with the then-governor, Ronald Reagan, who agreed to endorse his father.</p> <p>\u201cHe stands right on his mark and he looks at that camera and in one take \u2013 you would have sworn that he and my father had known each other their whole lives and they were just like this,\u201d he says, crossing his fingers. \u201cThis guy had sincerity like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re packing up, and I can hear [Reagan\u2019s assistant] leading him out there in the room and he goes, \u2018Okay, Governor.

He credits the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering with shifting his perspective on environmental stewardship. The forum in Elko, which mixes ranchers and environmentalists, conservatives and liberals, helped him see what both groups have in common \u2013 an intimate connection to the land.</p> <p>\u201cIf climate science suggesting we should take steps to reduce our use of fossil fuels \u2026is <em>in error,</em>and we take the suggested action anyway, the downside will be that we\u2019ve left more fossil fuel in the ground for our descendants,\u201d he wrote to those involved in the roundtable discussion. \u201cIf the preponderance of climate science is<em> correct,</em> and we do nothing to alter our carbon footprint, the downside will be that we\u2019ve rendered our planet uninhabitable for humans and many other species, all for the short term gains of those who currently benefit most from the status quo.\u201d</p> <p>Steiger\u2019s views on immigration stem primarily from his own experience working with undocumented immigrants in Arizona, the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of whom he found \u201cto be honest, hardworking people who did their jobs, supported their families and paid their taxes\u201d. He\u2019d rather see the US focus its time and money on the \u201ceconomic conditions, lawlessness, violence and desperation that causes people in Mexico and Central America to seek asylum here\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6f95f6ae2943a731dd7808a4c0b4814459230ac0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f95f6ae2943a731dd7808a4c0b4814459230ac0/0_0_2500_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Waddie Mitchell poses for a portrait at the 35th National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nev. on February 2, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Waddie Mitchell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mikayla Whitmore/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Waddie Mitchell: the land rights buckaroo</strong></h2> <p>Born and raised on a ranch near Jiggs, Nevada, a ghost town 36 miles south of Elko, Waddie Mitchell quit school at 16 years old. Like the cattlemen and \u201ctrue cowboys\u201d he idolized as kid, he soon found himself starting colts for a nearby ranch and living alone in a tiny bunkhouse with little but his own imagination to occupy him.</p> <p>That first winter alone, he was desperate for thicker gloves and new boots; his parents sent him a box of old books instead. \u201cI thought it was the worst present ever,\u201d he says. But the isolation got the best of him. He finally dived in. \u201cTo this day, I think it was the best present I ever got.\u201d</p> <p>It planted the first seed of what would later become a full-time career in the arts, writing and performing cowboy poetry for audiences across the country, from Elko to The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. In between, he\u2019d buckaroo all over the west, serve a tour in Vietnam, break horses for the US Cavalry in Fort Carson, Colorado, get married, raise five kids, and help found the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in 1985.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/cant-we-all-just-get-along-a-road-trip-with-my-trump-loving-cousin\">Can't we all just get along?

One day he was helping his uncle break horses on a ranch near Eagle, Colorado. The next he was \u201ccrippled\u201d, he says, confined to the hospital for a year, subject to the doctors\u2019 whims and his mother\u2019s whimsy, neither of which allowed for even the slightest suggestion of a return to the ranch. He killed the time reading Will James and the poems his grandmother had clipped from the livestock papers and collected in a shoebox, tranquillized by a stiff cocktail of existential despair.</p> <p>His mother eventually moved the family to Pueblo, Colorado, where his teachers tried their best to steer him towards more intellectual pursuits. But the cowboy never left him, and his heart remained at the ranch.</p> <p>\u201cIt created this huge conflict with everybody around me. With my folks, with my teachers. And that\u2019s my little problem with authority.\u201d</p> <p>At 15, he ran away from home and spent the rest of his teenage years hiring himself out at various ranches, earning $20 a month and attending roughly nine high schools before finally cobbling together enough credits to graduate. He kept working as a ranch hand until he met his wife, who purchased a farm and ranch in the San Luis Valley. They\u2019ve lived there ever since.</p> <p>Quinlan doesn\u2019t question whether the climate is changing \u2013 it always has, he says \u2013 but he\u2019s hardly convinced it\u2019s a manmade issue, nor does he place any faith in warnings from \u201cpublish-or-perish scientists and professors\u201d whom he believes are often bought and paid for by corporate interests. \u201cThe same agencies and scientists that are now predicting manmade global disaster,\u201d he says, were predicting the same when he first moved to the valley in 1970.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"353632fdf36ccb81452348f18cf890f2a2f192dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/353632fdf36ccb81452348f18cf890f2a2f192dd/0_0_2500_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guests participate during the \u201cCowboy Sing Along with Liz Dreisbach and Eugine Jablonsky at the 35th National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nev. on February 2, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guests participate during the Cowboy Sing Along with Liz Dreisbach and Eugine Jablonsky.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mikayla Whitmore/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBut it didn\u2019t really matter: the experts were predicting a coming famine because other farmers were even dumber than me and allowing erosion to wash all their topsoil into the Gulf of Mexico and would soon be trying to plant their soybeans on bedrock,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd besides, we were running out of fossil fuel and would soon be reading by candlelight and canning our meat. What meat we had left was from ranchers even dumber than farmers who were destroying their pastures by overgrazing.\u201d</p> <p>Like Steiger, he\u2019s worked with many undocumented immigrants over the years, almost all of whom were \u201cdecent people and good hands\u201d.

It\u2019s an ethic he carried to graduate school at the University of Montana, where he studied poetry under the celebrated American<strong> </strong>poet Richard Hugo and began competing as a bareback bronc rider. He kept at both until his mid-30s, subsisting on occasional<strong> </strong>winnings from the rodeo circuit, meager paychecks from a part-time teaching gig at the university, and the scraps he earned from his published work. Serendipitously, just as his body began to give out, he found a wider community for his work through the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8127b3e5ac79b885d9b561c5743670bbe94cd057\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8127b3e5ac79b885d9b561c5743670bbe94cd057/0_0_2500_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A crowd gathers after the \u201cRide &amp; Write \u2018Em Pretty\u201d event at the 35th National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nev. on February 2, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A crowd gathers after the Ride &amp; Write \u2019Em Pretty event in Elko.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mikayla Whitmore/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Few who are familiar with his work would be shocked to learn Zarzyski \u2013 one of the few here to write in mostly free verse \u2013 is liberal. Still, he makes it a point to step aside from politics each year when he enters Elko county, and he has dedicated more than a few poems to close friends across the aisle.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re asking, \u2018Do I bring it out in the open verbally?\u2019 the answer is no. It would be an extreme violation of all the goodness this<strong> </strong>gathering<strong> </strong>has stood for,\u201d he says. \u201cI have witnessed year after year people making pilgrimages here because they\u2019re in need of something<strong> </strong>missing from their lives that they can\u2019t quite articulate, but they had a pretty strong instinct that if they came here, they would be graced with that mecca-something or other, and<strong> </strong>they almost always inevitably are.\u201d</p> <p>Outside the confines of the gathering, however, he rarely holds back. Consider the final stanza of his unpublished poem, Knock-Knock-Knocking On Doomsday\u2019s Door, which lampoons both humanity\u2019s stupidity in the face of climate change, and the seemingly futile nature of his own work in the face of global crisis.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>\u2026This poem,</em></p> <p><em>then, exists only to sift its own ashen</em></p> <p><em>bone-fragment remains</em></p> <p><em>through its own chaliced fingers</em></p> <p><em>raised in a pathetic gesture</em></p> <p><em>of reckoning, raised to the billowing God-</em></p> <p><em>cloud of what was once</em></p> <p><em>each and every miracle, each</em></p> <p><em>and every mystery, each and every</em></p> <p><em>molecule of merciful matter</em></p> <p><em>this poem held dear \u2013</em><em> of what was</em></p> <p><em>once living, breathing</em></p> <p><em>twice-blest you \u2026 me \u2026 them \u2026 us \u2026 it.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Cognizant of his own half-Italian, half-Polish ancestry and their passage through Ellis Island, Zarzyski strongly identifies with those immigrants fleeing dire circumstances in their home countries.</p> <p>\u201cThey came here to give, as well as to receive \u2026 and I\u2019m not convinced that the larger majority of immigrants seeking security and safety for their families today do not harbor similar sensibilities as did our European immigrants,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>\u201cI understand, as well, that the \u2018green new deal\u2019 coupled with the long-overdue rebuilding of infrastructure in this country is not the panacea to all that ails us, but I can\u2019t help but wonder just how integral \u2013 how \u2018symbiotic,\u2019 if you will \u2013 are the solutions to immigration and climate change? Bottom line, it\u2019s\u2019 all going to come down to fresh perspectives and an entirely new way of applying hard work, white- and blue-collar work alike, to save us from ourselves, from destroying this glorious orb that gives everyone of us our, and everything its, existence.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"128d908baef0e6afad1151bc788ae0a62bed0eaa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/128d908baef0e6afad1151bc788ae0a62bed0eaa/0_0_2500_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Dofflemyer poses for a portrait at the 35th National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nev. on February 1, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Dofflemyer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mikayla Whitmore/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>John Dofflemyer: the Tulare county pragmatist</strong></h2> <p>A fifth-generation cattleman in Tulare county, California, John Dofflemyer \u201cweaned\u201d himself on the poetry of Gary Snyder, which he first encountered as a teenager while packing mules in the Sierra Nevada. \u201cI ran across his work and just came undone,\u201d he says. \u201cHis poetry really spoke to me in that minimalistic form.

      "bodyText": "Several weeks ahead of the 35th annual National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nevada, Gail Steiger, a rancher and singer-songwriter from Yavapai county, Arizona, emailed a proposal to a small host of close friends and fellow performers. \u201cNone of us fit easily in any box, but we all hold each other in high regard,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf we can\u2019t talk to each other about the future course of our country, who can? \u201cMaybe,\u201d he added, \u201cwe could see if old friends can at least have a conversation about these issues without demonizing each other.\u201d Steiger was proposing a political rendezvous amongst friends \u2013 some Republicans, some Democrats, some in the wild, open range in between \u2013 who have largely avoided the subject for their more than 30-year history together. In other circles, Steiger\u2019s request may have seemed commonplace. At the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering, a weeklong festival of western poetry and song cherished by thousands for its cultivation of community, it was a perilous suggestion. More than a few performers, they say, have shot themselves in the foot proselytizing in Elko. Of the five poets Steiger initially invited to participate in his offsite roundtable, two respectfully declined. The rodeo poet Paul Zarzyski, a diehard liberal from Great Falls, Montana, was one of them. \u201cThese people are so locked in. I was going to run head-on in that room,\u201d he later told me. \u201cI didn\u2019t need that here. Elko might be the one place I can come to and disconnect. When I go back, I\u2019m going to be looking on Huffington Post in the morning. I\u2019m going to be watching MSNBC. I\u2019m going to be thrown right back in again and this is a little sanctuary for five or six days.\u201d The rest of them quietly gathered in the old Hotel West, the Basque steakhouse next door boisterous with tourists and townies, the blinking lights of Elko\u2019s tiny brothel district visible from the back door. They sat around a large dining room table, discussing climate change and immigration, passing the \u201ctalking stick\u201d back and forth and striving unsuccessfully \u2013 like newcomers to a board game \u2013 to follow the rigid guidelines of a Socratic dialogue: more questions, fewer opinions. Gail Steiger: the congressman\u2019s son The son of a rancher and five-term Arizona congressman, Gail Steiger grew up with \u201ca different brand of politics\u201d. He used to accompany his father Sam to the weekly meetings of the Arizona delegation, and though all but one of them were Republican, he says, the lone Democrat commanded equal respect at the table. \u201cThey\u2019d laugh about that, but they were friends! They would sit down and say, \u2018What is best for Arizona?\u2019 They really tried hard to do that.\u201d But he\u2019d never harbored any particular fantasy of a career in politics, not after watching the way it skewed so many simple encounters into perverse transactions, everyone \u201cblowing smoke\u201d to gain access to his father. After he dropped out of college to help run his father\u2019s Senate campaign in 1976, he shut the door on politics for good, suddenly all too aware of just how manipulative and hollow the enterprise could be. The final straw was an encounter with the then-governor, Ronald Reagan, who agreed to endorse his father. \u201cHe stands right on his mark and he looks at that camera and in one take \u2013 you would have sworn that he and my father had known each other their whole lives and they were just like this,\u201d he says, crossing his fingers. \u201cThis guy had sincerity like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re packing up, and I can hear [Reagan\u2019s assistant] leading him out there in the room and he goes, \u2018Okay, Governor. This guy is the beer distributor. This guy started these little stores called Circle K \u2026 That light came on and it was like, holy shit! This guy\u2019s an actor. He\u2019s been practicing lines and making you believe him his whole life. This is show business.\u201d Finally disillusioned by politics, Steiger earned a business degree in Colorado, took a summer job working cattle back in Arizona and gradually fell in love with the work; he\u2019s been running cattle ever since. He credits the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering with shifting his perspective on environmental stewardship. The forum in Elko, which mixes ranchers and environmentalists, conservatives and liberals, helped him see what both groups have in common \u2013 an intimate connection to the land. \u201cIf climate science suggesting we should take steps to reduce our use of fossil fuels \u2026is in error,and we take the suggested action anyway, the downside will be that we\u2019ve left more fossil fuel in the ground for our descendants,\u201d he wrote to those involved in the roundtable discussion. \u201cIf the preponderance of climate science is correct, and we do nothing to alter our carbon footprint, the downside will be that we\u2019ve rendered our planet uninhabitable for humans and many other species, all for the short term gains of those who currently benefit most from the status quo.\u201d Steiger\u2019s views on immigration stem primarily from his own experience working with undocumented immigrants in Arizona, the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of whom he found \u201cto be honest, hardworking people who did their jobs, supported their families and paid their taxes\u201d. He\u2019d rather see the US focus its time and money on the \u201ceconomic conditions, lawlessness, violence and desperation that causes people in Mexico and Central America to seek asylum here\u201d. Waddie Mitchell: the land rights buckaroo Born and raised on a ranch near Jiggs, Nevada, a ghost town 36 miles south of Elko, Waddie Mitchell quit school at 16 years old. Like the cattlemen and \u201ctrue cowboys\u201d he idolized as kid, he soon found himself starting colts for a nearby ranch and living alone in a tiny bunkhouse with little but his own imagination to occupy him. That first winter alone, he was desperate for thicker gloves and new boots; his parents sent him a box of old books instead. \u201cI thought it was the worst present ever,\u201d he says. But the isolation got the best of him. He finally dived in. \u201cTo this day, I think it was the best present I ever got.\u201d It planted the first seed of what would later become a full-time career in the arts, writing and performing cowboy poetry for audiences across the country, from Elko to The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. In between, he\u2019d buckaroo all over the west, serve a tour in Vietnam, break horses for the US Cavalry in Fort Carson, Colorado, get married, raise five kids, and help found the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in 1985. In recent years, Mitchell has been an outspoken supporter of the Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, whose refusal to pay federal grazing fees led to an armed standoff in 2014 with government agents. Mitchell has written a host of op-eds for the local newspaper arguing against government overreach and the Bureau of Land Management\u2019s treatment of ranchers whose roots in the area predate the enforcement of grazing limits on federal lands. \u201cWe should not allow these unconstitutional, martial-law minded BLM globs to abuse power THEY GAVE THEMSELVES, against citizens who, unlike the tax suckers, actually produce something,\u201d he wrote in the Elko Daily Free Press in January 2016. Like the poet John Dofflemyer at the other end of the table, Mitchell stops short of declaring global warming a manmade issue, but he calls the increase in extreme weather events in his lifetime \u201csubstantial\u201d and says he stands with \u201cthe scientists, not the petroleum pamphlets, on this one\". \u201cNo matter our feelings on climate change, we need to clean up our act, steward all of our eco-systems as they are all interrelated. Try to help earth live in her natural state,\u201d he wrote the group. \u201cOur children and grandchildren will have to live with the air, water and policies we leave for them. If humankind is not responsible for the earth\u2019s climate change, we are [still] responsible for how we live and the messes we make.\u201d As for immigration: \u201cWhen they [immigrants] break the law coming to this country, we take it too lightly. I don\u2019t feel we should feel obliged to house, feed, give medical attention or financial assistance to those here illegally. I believe we should do better helping the Native peoples, to care for our own sick, those who go home to die because they can\u2019t afford medical costs,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI prescribe to family, tribe and America first, then our somewhat flawed policies and prescribed path to citizenship.\u201d Vess Quinlan: the semi-climate skeptic Vess Quinlan was 10 years old when he contracted polio. One day he was helping his uncle break horses on a ranch near Eagle, Colorado. The next he was \u201ccrippled\u201d, he says, confined to the hospital for a year, subject to the doctors\u2019 whims and his mother\u2019s whimsy, neither of which allowed for even the slightest suggestion of a return to the ranch. He killed the time reading Will James and the poems his grandmother had clipped from the livestock papers and collected in a shoebox, tranquillized by a stiff cocktail of existential despair. His mother eventually moved the family to Pueblo, Colorado, where his teachers tried their best to steer him towards more intellectual pursuits. But the cowboy never left him, and his heart remained at the ranch. \u201cIt created this huge conflict with everybody around me. With my folks, with my teachers. And that\u2019s my little problem with authority.\u201d At 15, he ran away from home and spent the rest of his teenage years hiring himself out at various ranches, earning $20 a month and attending roughly nine high schools before finally cobbling together enough credits to graduate. He kept working as a ranch hand until he met his wife, who purchased a farm and ranch in the San Luis Valley. They\u2019ve lived there ever since. Quinlan doesn\u2019t question whether the climate is changing \u2013 it always has, he says \u2013 but he\u2019s hardly convinced it\u2019s a manmade issue, nor does he place any faith in warnings from \u201cpublish-or-perish scientists and professors\u201d whom he believes are often bought and paid for by corporate interests. \u201cThe same agencies and scientists that are now predicting manmade global disaster,\u201d he says, were predicting the same when he first moved to the valley in 1970. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t really matter: the experts were predicting a coming famine because other farmers were even dumber than me and allowing erosion to wash all their topsoil into the Gulf of Mexico and would soon be trying to plant their soybeans on bedrock,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd besides, we were running out of fossil fuel and would soon be reading by candlelight and canning our meat. What meat we had left was from ranchers even dumber than farmers who were destroying their pastures by overgrazing.\u201d Like Steiger, he\u2019s worked with many undocumented immigrants over the years, almost all of whom were \u201cdecent people and good hands\u201d. If he were living in the same conditions they fled from, he says \u2013 the cartel violence and economic despair \u2013 he\u2019d do the same. \u201cI would be here asking John for a job picking fruit in his orchards, or asking Gail for day work on the Spider Ranch. If caught and sent back, I would start walking north as soon as I got off the bus.\u201d And though he believes America has a responsibility to \u201cdevelop a fair, affordable, and accessible immigration system\u201d, he also considers tight border security a moral imperative: \u201cI think it is immoral when we steal the best and brightest from poor countries by not controlling our border. Most of the illegals I worked with over the years were a credit to this country and would have \u2026 been a credit to their own if given a chance at a decent life.\u201d Paul Zarzyski: the bareback liberal Zarzyski grew up in awe of his father, an iron ore miner in Hurley, Wisconsin, and the brute force with which he approached every facet of his life, whether a mile deep in the hematite mine or \u201cmaking firewood\u201d. From an early age, he learned to throw his everything into everything. It\u2019s an ethic he carried to graduate school at the University of Montana, where he studied poetry under the celebrated American poet Richard Hugo and began competing as a bareback bronc rider. He kept at both until his mid-30s, subsisting on occasional winnings from the rodeo circuit, meager paychecks from a part-time teaching gig at the university, and the scraps he earned from his published work. Serendipitously, just as his body began to give out, he found a wider community for his work through the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering. Few who are familiar with his work would be shocked to learn Zarzyski \u2013 one of the few here to write in mostly free verse \u2013 is liberal. Still, he makes it a point to step aside from politics each year when he enters Elko county, and he has dedicated more than a few poems to close friends across the aisle. \u201cIf you\u2019re asking, \u2018Do I bring it out in the open verbally?\u2019 the answer is no. It would be an extreme violation of all the goodness this gathering has stood for,\u201d he says. \u201cI have witnessed year after year people making pilgrimages here because they\u2019re in need of something missing from their lives that they can\u2019t quite articulate, but they had a pretty strong instinct that if they came here, they would be graced with that mecca-something or other, and they almost always inevitably are.\u201d Outside the confines of the gathering, however, he rarely holds back. Consider the final stanza of his unpublished poem, Knock-Knock-Knocking On Doomsday\u2019s Door, which lampoons both humanity\u2019s stupidity in the face of climate change, and the seemingly futile nature of his own work in the face of global crisis. \u2026This poem, then, exists only to sift its own ashen bone-fragment remains through its own chaliced fingers raised in a pathetic gesture of reckoning, raised to the billowing God- cloud of what was once each and every miracle, each and every mystery, each and every molecule of merciful matter this poem held dear \u2013 of what was once living, breathing twice-blest you \u2026 me \u2026 them \u2026 us \u2026 it. Cognizant of his own half-Italian, half-Polish ancestry and their passage through Ellis Island, Zarzyski strongly identifies with those immigrants fleeing dire circumstances in their home countries. \u201cThey came here to give, as well as to receive \u2026 and I\u2019m not convinced that the larger majority of immigrants seeking security and safety for their families today do not harbor similar sensibilities as did our European immigrants,\u201d he writes. \u201cI understand, as well, that the \u2018green new deal\u2019 coupled with the long-overdue rebuilding of infrastructure in this country is not the panacea to all that ails us, but I can\u2019t help but wonder just how integral \u2013 how \u2018symbiotic,\u2019 if you will \u2013 are the solutions to immigration and climate change? Bottom line, it\u2019s\u2019 all going to come down to fresh perspectives and an entirely new way of applying hard work, white- and blue-collar work alike, to save us from ourselves, from destroying this glorious orb that gives everyone of us our, and everything its, existence.\u201d John Dofflemyer: the Tulare county pragmatist A fifth-generation cattleman in Tulare county, California, John Dofflemyer \u201cweaned\u201d himself on the poetry of Gary Snyder, which he first encountered as a teenager while packing mules in the Sierra Nevada. \u201cI ran across his work and just came undone,\u201d he says. \u201cHis poetry really spoke to me in that minimalistic form. Gary doesn\u2019t use a lot of multisyllabic words, and I realized, shit, I was capable of writing.\u201d After graduation, he enrolled at the University of Southern California, distractedly studying business, certain \u201cmy graduation present would be an AR-15 and some camo gear\u201d. But he failed the draft physical with a bum knee from a rugby injury and instead returned home to work the family ranch full-time. After first performing at the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in 1989, he launched the quarterly Dry Crik Review, encouraging verse grounded less in the past than the cowboy present, the challenges and opportunities facing ranchers today. Though he no longer prints the physical chapbooks, he continues to publish his own work on the Dry Crik Journal website. Work like The Climate of Change, in which he finally asks: How long can we be entertained by delusion, the dissolution of civility, of compassion as the planet prepares for the business of war \u2013 already overstocked with banks of houses stacked upon the fading fruited plains? Dofflemyer often resists crediting human activity for global warming, but either way, he wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s only prudent to make provisions for a warmer and drier climate where we can.\u201d As for immigration: \u201cCongress needs to address our immigration policy in a practical and humane way. Separating children from their parents and holding immigrants in concentration camps is no better strategy than completing the construction of a wall that has been tunneled under for decades. Instead of a political bargaining chip, the Daca program needs to be resolved compassionately.\u201d An anti-war demonstrator during his college years, he admits he\u2019s lately grown fatalistic, that he views his own political involvement as \u201ca futile exercise.\u201d And perhaps more importantly, he says, \u201crelationships with neighboring ranchers are too vital and important for us to jeopardize, so it\u2019s out of respect for them and getting along that we don\u2019t discuss politics.\u201d Later that week, as visitors flooded downtown Elko and the group scattered to fulfill their various performance schedules, each of them told me separately they had never held any hopes of changing anyone\u2019s mind and were certain no one had. Still, they were curious to see how the night would play out. A few of them felt the exercise was important, a test of their friendship, an affront to the larger partisan forces currently alienating friends and relatives. Though none of them tested the waters again \u2013 certainly not on stage \u2013 they regretted little more than their own mismanagement of the dialogue. They had opined too much, or their questions had been too narrow, or they had lost track of the order. They had never gotten around to income inequality. \u201cI don\u2019t have any illusions of saving the world, but you do what you can,\u201d Steiger says. \u201cAnd I will tell you that I feel a lot better after trying than I did just ranting and raving about those stupid son-of-a-guns who don\u2019t agree with me.\u201d",

Staples and other local water interests protested to the state over the developer\u2019s plans to pull water from a well drilled down from the top of the mountain, amid concerns it would interfere with the preexisting water rights. An agreement was reached in 2016. \u201cWe\u2019ve put all our disagreements behind us and we\u2019re moving ahead with a positive attitude so everyone can succeed,\u201d Staples said. As part of the agreement, Summit purchased 15 \u201cshares\u201d, at $10,000 a share, of water from Staples\u2019 firm. None of the 150 shareholders wanted to sell the shares to Summit, Staples said, so in the end he did it himself, \u201cbecause I recognized if we\u2019re going to be partners in the mountain we need to participate in a friendly manner\u201d. But the cost of hiring a hydrologist and attorneys to defend their water rights, which Staples estimated in the \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars\u201d, and the shadow of that struggle, lingers. \u201cYou have two different cultures trying to mesh into the same community, and that presents some challenges,\u201d Staples said. The incongruities of a rural, agricultural Mormon culture being reshaped by wealth and power are never far from view. On a late Friday afternoon, as locals parked their trucks by the market and headed inside for their weekend groceries, some watched with bemusement. Struggling to maneuver out of the lot, inching back and then forward, was an interloper from another world: a white stretched limo with tinted windows.",

I went to an all-girls school where this was going on all the time. We were all busy nicking each other\u2019s friends and making each other\u2019s lives a misery.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was definitely a model for The Favourite,\u201d she says, particularly the character of Eve, on whom she modelled Abigail in the absence of any real historical details. \u201cFor me, Abigail is a sociopath and so is Eve Harrington. Neither of them have any conscience. Eve goes in, she lies about her background, she ingratiates herself into Margo Channing\u2019s life and then we gradually see her ambition unfolding. There is a fantastic scene where she\u2019s standing in front of the mirror with Margo\u2019s dress held up against her. You know what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s just a question of how she\u2019s going to get to wear that dress herself, and when.\u201d</p> <p>That is not to say the other women in the cast are pushovers \u2013 far from it. Channing\u2019s longstanding maid, Birdie, realises exactly what Eve is from the very first scene. \u201cShe\u2019s studying you,\u201d she warns. When Margo\u2019s best friend Karen Richards catches on, her playwright husband accuses her of being a cynic. \u201cThat cynicism you refer to is something I acquired the day I realised I was different from little boys,\u201d she hisses back.</p> <p>\u201cAll the wittiest lines in the film belong to the women,\u201d says film critic Molly Haskell. \u201cThese women are never just pathetic.<strong> </strong>Mankiewicz is so fascinated by women and sympathetic towards them: he gives them importance, he gives them idiosyncrasy, he gives them their personalities.\u201d</p> <p>This is not just reserved for the lead characters. As Haskell points out, in Karen\u2019s sharpness against her husband, \u201cMankiewicz sees the plight of the wife and how she\u2019s finally getting her own back for all the things she does but doesn\u2019t get credit for.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"208769bb13732f283e1b918c6200ebeda171d1c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/208769bb13732f283e1b918c6200ebeda171d1c5/0_0_2684_1611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No conscience ...

It takes the theme of women being silenced, forced to listen to men and learn from them regardless of their own talents, and turns men into the butt of the joke. When Margo throws a birthday party for her partner, the director Bill Sampson, the poison-penned theatre critic Addison DeWitt turns up with a young blonde on his arm, a Miss Caswell (played by the then little-known <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKhyLCjIpvw\" title=\"\">Marilyn Monroe</a>). Channing suggests Eve and DeWitt should talk about their shared love of the theatre. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Mr DeWitt might find me boring after too long,\u201d says Eve, saccharinely coy. \u201cOh you won\u2019t bore him, honey,\u201d says Miss Caswell. \u201cYou won\u2019t even get the chance to talk.\u201d</p> <p>It is an extraordinary scene, says Haskell, \u201cespecially when you consider that Monroe\u2019s character is not meant to have lines. She\u2019s meant to be just a bimbo. Yet out of this bimbo come these words of wisdom. Everyone has dignity and authority in their own way in the movie.\u201d</p> <p>None more so than Margo Channing. There is a brittleness and defiance about her that never falters. She has worked out exactly what Eve is doing as Bill arrives for his party and spends the first 20 minutes locked in conversation with her. Margo confronts him; he calls her paranoid, insecure, says she should be ashamed of herself. She remains poised. Is her tantrum over, Karen asks? Absolutely not. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPPJdOGshUM\" title=\"\">Fasten your seatbelts</a>,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKHUGvde7KU\" title=\"\">she says</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a bumpy night.\u201d</p> <p>There are so many traps that All About Eve could have fallen into: Eve could have been the victim, or the underdog we cheer for; Margo could have been a gargoyle or a caricature (like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMUJpec6Bdc\" title=\"\">Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard</a> or, indeed, so many other films with older women).

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s the car scene that gets you in All About Eve, Joseph L Mankiewicz\u2019s radical 1950 film about an obsessed fan, Eve Harrington, who tries to muscle in and steal the life of her favourite Broadway star. Bette Davis plays that star, cinema\u2019s great feminist heroine Margo Channing. She has it all: fame, talent, wealth, beauty, a devoted partner, loyal friends. But she is 40, childless and tired of playing characters who are in their 20s (\u201cBe a playwright with guts,\u201d she tells the most successful writer in America. \u201cWrite me one about a nice normal woman who just shoots her husband\u201d). She should be on stage but she is stuck, in the cold and dark, in a car that has run out of petrol, acidulously contemplating what it is \u2013 and what has to be sacrificed \u2013 to be a successful woman. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny business, a woman\u2019s career,\u201d she says. \u201cThe things you drop on your way up the ladder so you can move faster \u2013 you forget you need them again when you get back to being a woman. It\u2019s one career all females have in common whether we like it or not \u2013 being a woman. Sooner or later we\u2019ve got to work at it, no matter how many other careers we\u2019ve had or wanted.\u201d It is a monologue so painfully fresh it could have been written yesterday. That is perhaps why this barbed tale of female ambition that is so deft in its depiction of the inner lives and complexities of women continues to fascinate audiences and artists. It is the basis for Oscar-tipped film The Favourite, in which Emma Stone plays a young upstart, Abigail, who is deviously trying to replace Rachel Weisz as the favourite handmaid of Queen Anne (Olivia Colman).

To watch him in the recent documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/20/i-am-not-your-negro-review-james-baldwin-raoul-peck\">I Am Not Your Negro</a> is exhilarating, showing just what an unstoppable moral and intellectual force he was. It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s hard to disagree with him; it\u2019s impossible to argue with him. Representatives of the old order charge towards his machine-gun rhetoric like sword-waving cavalrymen and they are mown down.</p> <p>He was politely devastating when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fZQQ7o16yQ\">Professor Paul Weiss tried to tell him on the Dick Cavett TV chatshow</a> that he shouldn\u2019t be so concerned about \u201ccolour\u201d, when his life has been threatened, and his friends have been killed, precisely because of colour. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFeoS41xe7w\">the footage of Baldwin</a> shredding the rightwing commentator William F Buckley at the Cambridge Union is one of the most impressive rhetorical performances of the modern age. \u201cIt is a terrible thing for an entire people to surrender to the notion that one ninth of its population is beneath them,\u201d he said <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/29/specials/baldwin-dream.html\">toward the end of his speech</a>. \u201cUntil the moment comes when we, the Americans, are able to accept the fact that my ancestors are both black and white, that on that continent we are trying to forge a new identity, that we need each other, that I am not a ward of America, I am not an object of missionary charity, I am one of the people who built the country \u2013 until this moment comes there is scarcely any hope for the American dream.\u201d At his conclusion, the room erupted in a standing ovation. Baldwin\u2019s words were forged in injustice and tragedy, making his delivery all the more remarkable. It feels impossible to imagine anyone who could ever take him on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/20/i-am-not-your-negro-review-james-baldwin-raoul-peck\">I Am Not Your Negro review \u2013 James Baldwin's words weave film of immense power</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there was one person capable of defeating James Baldwin \u2013 and that was James Baldwin. In Giovanni\u2019s Room, he goes to war with himself and loses.</p> <p>On the one hand, the novel feels as if it is striving to be a regular love story, describing something natural and joyous. Two young and beautiful people meet in a bar in Paris. There is an immediate spark. \u201cWe connected the instant that we met,\u201d says the narrator. They enjoy talking together and the narrator feels \u201cshy\u201d. They flirt. They drink. They stay up too late and walk across the Seine in the early morning, have breakfast, make love, move in together. There is tenderness and affection. They make each other laugh. One of them declares, \u201cI have only just found out that I want to live.\u201d</p> <p>But there are obstacles. Because the two lovers are both men and \u201cpeople have dirty words for \u2013 for this situation\u201d. David, the narrator, begins to feel his life is \u201coccurring beneath the sea\u201d. His love is \u201ca cavern in which I would be tortured until madness came, in which I would lose my manhood\u201d. The thing that brings him joy also brings him terror and mortification. \u201cI was ashamed,\u201d he says of his first same sex encounter. \u201cThe very bed in its sweet disorder, testified to vileness.\u201d</p> <p>David also regards most other gay men with horror, comparing a boy who goes out at night in makeup and earrings to \u201cmonkeys eating their own excrement\u201d and bitterly scorns older men he sees chasing youth. This is contempt is made worse still because it is also \u201cself-contempt\u201d.</p> <p>This blend of beauty and disgust makes for a destabilising reading experience. Everything up and down. One minute we\u2019ll be appreciating the beauty of Parisian rooftops, \u201ctheir myriad stacks very beautiful and vari-coloured under the pearly sky\u201d; the next, we\u2019re down on pavements \u201cslick with leavings, mainly cast off rotten leaves, flowers, fruit and vegetables which had met with disaster natural and slow, or abrupt\u201d.</p> <p>We are witnessing a mind in turmoil, tangled and contradictory.

      "bodyText": "Today James Baldwin is most frequently encountered as a \u201ctrailblazer of the civil rights movement\u201d; a magnificent prophet who declared that \u201cignorance, allied with power, is the most ferocious enemy justice can have\u201d. His contemporary relevance is so obvious it hardly needs to be stated \u2013 although it\u2019s always good to be reminded. To watch him in the recent documentary I Am Not Your Negro is exhilarating, showing just what an unstoppable moral and intellectual force he was. It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s hard to disagree with him; it\u2019s impossible to argue with him. Representatives of the old order charge towards his machine-gun rhetoric like sword-waving cavalrymen and they are mown down. He was politely devastating when Professor Paul Weiss tried to tell him on the Dick Cavett TV chatshow that he shouldn\u2019t be so concerned about \u201ccolour\u201d, when his life has been threatened, and his friends have been killed, precisely because of colour. Meanwhile, the footage of Baldwin shredding the rightwing commentator William F Buckley at the Cambridge Union is one of the most impressive rhetorical performances of the modern age. \u201cIt is a terrible thing for an entire people to surrender to the notion that one ninth of its population is beneath them,\u201d he said toward the end of his speech. \u201cUntil the moment comes when we, the Americans, are able to accept the fact that my ancestors are both black and white, that on that continent we are trying to forge a new identity, that we need each other, that I am not a ward of America, I am not an object of missionary charity, I am one of the people who built the country \u2013 until this moment comes there is scarcely any hope for the American dream.\u201d At his conclusion, the room erupted in a standing ovation. Baldwin\u2019s words were forged in injustice and tragedy, making his delivery all the more remarkable. It feels impossible to imagine anyone who could ever take him on. But there was one person capable of defeating James Baldwin \u2013 and that was James Baldwin. In Giovanni\u2019s Room, he goes to war with himself and loses. On the one hand, the novel feels as if it is striving to be a regular love story, describing something natural and joyous. Two young and beautiful people meet in a bar in Paris. There is an immediate spark. \u201cWe connected the instant that we met,\u201d says the narrator. They enjoy talking together and the narrator feels \u201cshy\u201d. They flirt. They drink. They stay up too late and walk across the Seine in the early morning, have breakfast, make love, move in together. There is tenderness and affection. They make each other laugh. One of them declares, \u201cI have only just found out that I want to live.\u201d But there are obstacles. Because the two lovers are both men and \u201cpeople have dirty words for \u2013 for this situation\u201d. David, the narrator, begins to feel his life is \u201coccurring beneath the sea\u201d. His love is \u201ca cavern in which I would be tortured until madness came, in which I would lose my manhood\u201d. The thing that brings him joy also brings him terror and mortification. \u201cI was ashamed,\u201d he says of his first same sex encounter. \u201cThe very bed in its sweet disorder, testified to vileness.\u201d David also regards most other gay men with horror, comparing a boy who goes out at night in makeup and earrings to \u201cmonkeys eating their own excrement\u201d and bitterly scorns older men he sees chasing youth. This is contempt is made worse still because it is also \u201cself-contempt\u201d. This blend of beauty and disgust makes for a destabilising reading experience. Everything up and down. One minute we\u2019ll be appreciating the beauty of Parisian rooftops, \u201ctheir myriad stacks very beautiful and vari-coloured under the pearly sky\u201d; the next, we\u2019re down on pavements \u201cslick with leavings, mainly cast off rotten leaves, flowers, fruit and vegetables which had met with disaster natural and slow, or abrupt\u201d. We are witnessing a mind in turmoil, tangled and contradictory. This novel is unquestionably powerful and sad. But it can also feel tortured. David should not be mistaken for Baldwin, but it\u2019s hard to separate the author entirely from his pain and moral uncertainty. After all, he chose Walt Whitman for the epigraph: \u201cI am the man, I suffered, I was there.\u201d But that\u2019s not to say that this doubting 1956 novel should be completely separated from the rhetorician, who spoke with such clarity and assurance at the Cambridge Union in 1965. Because there, Baldwin spoke as a man who knew what it was to be hesitant, vulnerable and defeated \u2013 and was all the more effective as a result. He contained multitudes.",

      "bodyText": "Chuka Umunna has said he hopes a new party will be created by the end of the year, after he and six other MPs quit Labour citing anger at the party\u2019s Brexit policy and the issue of antisemitism. Umunna hinted that he expected more MPs, including some from the Conservative party, to depart in the coming days and weeks. \u201cI would like to see us move as quickly as possible and certainly by the end of the year, but that\u2019s my personal view,\u201d he told ITV. \u201cThere needs to be an alternative, so that\u2019s perfectly possible. But I don\u2019t get to determine this.\u201d Umunna \u2013 who quit the party alongside Luciana Berger, Mike Gapes, Chris Leslie, Angela Smith, Gavin Shuker and Ann Coffey \u2013 said moderate Conservatives had \u201cbecome demoralised by the Ukip-isation of their party and their position on Europe\u201d. At least two Tory MPs are believed to be seriously considering their position in the party and more could follow them, with names including Sarah Wollaston, Heidi Allen and Nick Boles. Other Labour MPs on Monday night suggested their response would be governed by the reaction of the party leadership. \u201cFrank Field left Labour over bullying six months ago,\u201d MP Neil Coyle said. \u201cThat was avoidable but his work and name were allowed to be smeared and the swaggering \u2018brocialism\u2019 has continued and festered. That failure had consequences that contributed to more members and MPs leaving Labour. A continued failure to tackle problems will cause more departures.\u201d Ian Austin, another Labour MP, also said overnight he was disappointed with the response from the leadership. \u201cIf this is the best the leadership can do then I think this will result in more people leaving,\u201d he said. \u201cI think today\u2019s events will mean lots of people will be reflecting.\u201d Umunna told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that he understood it was a big decision for other colleagues to make but said he and the other six MPs were putting \u201ceverything on line\u201d by taking the plunge. \u201cI believe people will want to see more politicians do that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many other people who have misgivings about their parties. If we\u2019re to fix the broken politics, you can\u2019t do that within the existing parties who can\u2019t be the change because they\u2019ve become the problem in my view.\u201d Umunna said the new party would be built by those who decided to join the group as independents and those outside Westminster. \u201cYou can\u2019t have this cooked up by seven people in Westminster,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we just do things the same old way and announce things at podiums and tell people how it\u2019s going to be then we are just behaving like the establishment and we want to be different.\u201d On Monday it was also revealed that the former deputy leader of Liverpool council, Derek Hatton, a member of the Trotskyist group Militant, had been readmitted to the party. Hatton, speaking on the Today programme, called the MPs who quit \u201cpathetic\u201d and said he was pleased to be back in the party after his expulsion three decades ago. \u201cFor 34 years I\u2019ve stayed absolutely solid with the Labour party.

Long-Bailey said Brexit as well as mounting domestic problems such as homelessness, crime and universal credit meant the party should \u201cprovide a united front\u201d despite some differences. Asked if the party would experience more days like Monday, she said: \u201cI truly hope we don\u2019t.

With 19 goals to his name already this season, Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s Serbian striker Luka Jovi\u0107, is a player in big demand. On loan at the German side from Benfica, the 21-year-old Serb has turned heads at Chelsea, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, but currently looks more likely to go to Barcelona. Real Madrid are more confident of bringing Porto\u2019s Brazilian central defender \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o to the Bernab\u00e9u in exchange for around \u00a344m, although the central defender also has admirers in Juventus.",

      "body": "<p>I had never read <a href=\"http://adalimon.com/about.html\" title=\"\">Ada Lim\u00f3n</a> when I dipped into <em>Bright Dead Things</em><em> </em>and <em>The Carrying</em> (published simultaneously in Britain), but have since discovered that Lim\u00f3n is far from an unknown quantity in her native US. <em><a href=\"http://www.theliteraryreview.org/book-review/a-review-of-bright-dead-things-by-ada-limon/\" title=\"\">Bright Dead Things</a></em>, her fourth collection, was shortlisted for the National Book award and feted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/sep/16/on-my-radar-tracy-k-smith-poet\" title=\"\">Tracy K Smith</a>, the US poet laureate. Lim\u00f3n has been published in the<em> New Yorker</em> and the <em>New York Times</em>. And she is that rare thing \u2013 a poet whose work sells.</p> <p>It sells for the same reason that it spoke to me. I was ambushed by her power to move \u2013 several poems brought a lump to my throat. Yet her popularity is about more than accessibility. She never hides behind words but reveals herself through them \u2013 even when the risk is overexposure. She situates herself in her writing as a figure in a landscape \u2013 rural Kentucky \u2013 and her struggles (especially with fertility in Carrying) are set against this unheeding pastoral scene. In a recent interview, she said she thought it important that poets should not \u201cjust write poems for other poets\u201d. She makes no apology for keeping it simple.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is an aloneness in this poetry \u2013 even in company \u2013 and at the same time a generosity in the sharing with readers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>The Carrying</em> is her fifth collection and its opening poem, A Name, imagines Eve in the garden of Eden naming the animals \u201cnightingale, red-shouldered hawk,/ fiddler crab, fallow deer\u201d and then continues: \u201cI wonder if she ever wanted/ them to speak back, looked into/ their wide wonderful eyes and/ whispered, <em>Name me, name me.</em>\u201d I initially balked at \u201cwide wonderful\u201d as Disney adjectives (although might they not also be accurate?) but what matters most is the poem\u2019s directness and what so many of her poems share \u2013 an instinctive sense of where and how to end. She knows how to change direction at the last moment, knows an ending can be an elsewhere.</p> <p>The book is full of the importance of naming. In Against Belonging, about a new home defining itself, she writes about how, \u201cWith each new name, the world expanded.\u201d In On a Lamppost Long Ago, she writes about languages disappearing and continues: \u201cThere are too many things to hold in the palm of the brain./ Your father with Alzheimer\u2019s uses the word thing to describe/ many different nouns and we guess the word he means./ When we get it right, he nods as if it\u2019s obvious./ When we get it wrong, his face closes like a fist.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout \u2013 tacitly underlying all this naming \u2013 is, perhaps, an unconceived, longed for, unnamed child. In Mastering, she writes about the hideousness of a friend swanking about his child in her presence. There is an aloneness in this poetry \u2013 even in company \u2013 and at the same time a generosity in the sharing with readers.</p> <p>What is particularly unusual is that Lim\u00f3n finds an ardour in compromise, making her peace with childlessness and with life\u2019s imperfection. It seems that this period of trying to conceive has pushed her poetry to its limit, that it exists on the frontier between something and nothing. It describes an effortful time that makes these apparently effortless, quick-release poems all the more merciful and beautiful. There is nothing self-indulgent here but there is humorous self-assertion. In Prey she advises: \u201cDon\u2019t be the mouse\u201d \u2013 and she isn\u2019t.</p> <p>Part of the pleasure of reading Lim\u00f3n is the way she transports you to a Kentucky punctuated by the noise of trains, the presence of horses, the planting of seeds. She does not ignore the world\u2019s cruelties but tries not to be held hostage by them. This is as-the-crow flies poetry \u2013 it goes straight to the heart.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Carrying</em> by Ada Lim\u00f3n is published by Corsair (\u00a310.99).

      "bodyText": "I had never read Ada Lim\u00f3n when I dipped into Bright Dead Things and The Carrying (published simultaneously in Britain), but have since discovered that Lim\u00f3n is far from an unknown quantity in her native US. Bright Dead Things, her fourth collection, was shortlisted for the National Book award and feted by Tracy K Smith, the US poet laureate. Lim\u00f3n has been published in the New Yorker and the New York Times. And she is that rare thing \u2013 a poet whose work sells. It sells for the same reason that it spoke to me. I was ambushed by her power to move \u2013 several poems brought a lump to my throat. Yet her popularity is about more than accessibility. She never hides behind words but reveals herself through them \u2013 even when the risk is overexposure. She situates herself in her writing as a figure in a landscape \u2013 rural Kentucky \u2013 and her struggles (especially with fertility in Carrying) are set against this unheeding pastoral scene. In a recent interview, she said she thought it important that poets should not \u201cjust write poems for other poets\u201d. She makes no apology for keeping it simple. The Carrying is her fifth collection and its opening poem, A Name, imagines Eve in the garden of Eden naming the animals \u201cnightingale, red-shouldered hawk,/ fiddler crab, fallow deer\u201d and then continues: \u201cI wonder if she ever wanted/ them to speak back, looked into/ their wide wonderful eyes and/ whispered, Name me, name me.\u201d I initially balked at \u201cwide wonderful\u201d as Disney adjectives (although might they not also be accurate?) but what matters most is the poem\u2019s directness and what so many of her poems share \u2013 an instinctive sense of where and how to end. She knows how to change direction at the last moment, knows an ending can be an elsewhere. The book is full of the importance of naming. In Against Belonging, about a new home defining itself, she writes about how, \u201cWith each new name, the world expanded.\u201d In On a Lamppost Long Ago, she writes about languages disappearing and continues: \u201cThere are too many things to hold in the palm of the brain./ Your father with Alzheimer\u2019s uses the word thing to describe/ many different nouns and we guess the word he means./ When we get it right, he nods as if it\u2019s obvious./ When we get it wrong, his face closes like a fist.\u201d Throughout \u2013 tacitly underlying all this naming \u2013 is, perhaps, an unconceived, longed for, unnamed child. In Mastering, she writes about the hideousness of a friend swanking about his child in her presence. There is an aloneness in this poetry \u2013 even in company \u2013 and at the same time a generosity in the sharing with readers. What is particularly unusual is that Lim\u00f3n finds an ardour in compromise, making her peace with childlessness and with life\u2019s imperfection. It seems that this period of trying to conceive has pushed her poetry to its limit, that it exists on the frontier between something and nothing. It describes an effortful time that makes these apparently effortless, quick-release poems all the more merciful and beautiful. There is nothing self-indulgent here but there is humorous self-assertion. In Prey she advises: \u201cDon\u2019t be the mouse\u201d \u2013 and she isn\u2019t. Part of the pleasure of reading Lim\u00f3n is the way she transports you to a Kentucky punctuated by the noise of trains, the presence of horses, the planting of seeds. She does not ignore the world\u2019s cruelties but tries not to be held hostage by them. This is as-the-crow flies poetry \u2013 it goes straight to the heart. \u2022 The Carrying by Ada Lim\u00f3n is published by Corsair (\u00a310.99).

I\u2019m not large from this distance, just a fence post, a hedge of holly. Wider still, beyond the rumble of overpass, mares look for what\u2019s left of green in the pasture, a few weanlings kick out, and theirs is the same sky, white like a calm flag of surrender pulled taut.

Stevenson jokes with parents that they should only do three things for their kids: drive them, care for them, and pay for them. \u201cYou\u2019re not their coach,\u201d he says. And for parents who are coaches, he tells them it\u2019s sometimes their job to let go: \u201cthe information [may be] on point, but they don\u2019t want to listen to mom and dad.\u201d Jaeger, for her part, decided to keep her father as her coach, but acknowledges it was tough. \u201cHe was actually a phenomenal coach,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the whole fact was I lost him as a father.

While success depends on long hours training, it shouldn\u2019t feel like a job. Dr Steven Smith, who specializes in clinical sport psychology for adolescents, describes the difference between deliberate practice, where the focus is on drilling and improving skills, and deliberate play, \u201cwhere kids get together, sometimes with an adult and sometimes not, and they just play.\u201d While both are important to improving one\u2019s skills, it\u2019s important that the young athlete isn\u2019t just practicing the sport; the enjoyment, after all, comes from playing it.</p> <p>--</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"863006d79f826482c75b9c7774c15ae5afe0cf91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/863006d79f826482c75b9c7774c15ae5afe0cf91/0_623_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrea Jaeger in action at Wimbledon at the age of 14\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrea Jaeger in action at Wimbledon at the age of 14.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Duffy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jaeger only started playing tennis at the age of eight, but by 10 she was giving interviews, and by 14, she had turned pro. \u201cI had People Magazine, Sports Illustrated, and Life Magazine at my junior high,\u201d she says.

She beat Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova, and Chris Evert. \u201cPersonally, for me, I was fine being 14, being a professional tennis player.

She notes today\u2019s organizing bodies are better, but she says there should be a safety system that includes background checks on adults who come in contact with young athletes. Jaeger points to the failure of USA Gymnastics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/05/larry-nassar-sexual-abuse-gymnastics-prison-sentence\">to protect athletes from the sexual abuser Larry Nassar</a>. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for it,\u201d she says. \u201cAddress the professionalism in the adults, and then maybe you\u2019ll see these kids lasting longer.\u201d</p> <p>Jaeger, for her part, faced an organizing body that didn\u2019t understand and actively tried to dissuade her from her other passion: charity. In between matches and practices, Jaeger would often go to the local hospital and bring toys for the kids. She never told anyone what she was doing in her spare time, but when a local newspaper wrote up as story about her talking about suicide prevention at a high school in White Plains, New York, the WTA gave her an ultimatum: tennis or charity. \u201cYou have to quit doing this.

Part of this is the wear and tear that specialization in a sport, defined as competing for at least nine months of the year, requires. When there\u2019s no off time, there\u2019s less time for muscles to heal. (It\u2019s no surprise then that Liu has had multiple hip <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/sports/article/Richmond-s-U-S-champion-figure-skater-Alysa-13564012.php\">surgeries</a>.)</p> <p>Popkin noticed a problem that came up time and again when treating young athletes\u2019 injuries. After the injuries began to heal, some children would avoid their sport. \u201cThere was a psychological component to overcome as well. There were some similarities with PTSD,\u201d Popkin says. Along with other surgeons and psychologists at Columbia University, he <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6083780/\">shared his findings in a paper</a> this past summer. They found that young athletes who tear their ACL, have \u201cemotional trauma, anxiety, symptoms of hyperarousal, avoidance of their activity.\u201d The problem, Popkin says, is that for \u201ca lot of kids, particularly if they specialize early, their identity is wrapped up in their sport.\u201d</p> <p>Smith has seen the same thing. \u201cYou have someone who has just done one sport, and they don\u2019t think of themselves as good students, they don\u2019t think of themselves as artists, they don\u2019t think of themselves as anything but their sport, and then they blow out a knee or they have an ACL tear, or they\u2019ve got one too many concussions, whatever it is, then what?\u201d</p> <p>For Jaeger, that point was put to her starkly after she blew out her shoulder in the first round of the 1984 French Open. After she defaulted the match, she says a reporter came up to her and told her: \u201cYou will never amount to anything ever again now that you can no longer play tennis. She now recalls: <em>\u201c</em>People didn\u2019t talk to me for years, years because I was no longer of value.\u201d</p> <p>But Jaeger had other plans. \u201cMy shoulder popped, and I was like \u2018OK, God decided I go help kids full time.\u2019\u201d It took her a few more years to leave professional tennis, but when she did, used her winnings to begin <a href=\"https://www.littlestar.org/\">The Little Star Foundation</a>, a charity for children with cancer she still runs today.</p> <p>Many people point to Jaeger as an example of a child prodigy who lost her childhood. Jaeger doesn\u2019t see it that way. \u201cI had a great childhood. I traveled my juniors. I went to Australia at age 10, South Africa at age 13.\u201d Jaeger missed her prom, but \u201cI just wasn\u2019t that kid,\u201d she says. \u201cI chose to be on the circuit. I chose to turn pro.

      "bodyText": "Alysa Liu covered her face and cried as the results were announced at the US ladies figure skating championship in Detroit, Michigan, last month. Her coach, Laura Lipetsky who has worked with her since she was five, hugged her. Liu had just won the national title at the age of 13, making her the youngest athlete to have done so, and with two triple axels no less. The weeks since have been a media frenzy. She appeared on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, and profiles on her meteoric rise have been published across the world. But for all the attention Liu has received, she won\u2019t be able to compete in Worlds. She\u2019s too young. A 1997 International Skating Union rule requires athletes to be at least 15 by 1 July preceding the season to participate in senior-level international events. That poses a question: is 13 too young to devote one\u2019s life to sports? How young is too young to be a full-time athlete? -- Liu\u2019s childhood has been anything but ordinary. She usually trains four to five hours a day at the Oakland Ice Center under Lipetsky, who says in an email she spends so much time with Liu on a daily basis that \u201cI feel like I am a mother to her.\u201d At the age of 10, Liu enrolled in California Connections Academy, an online program used by other elite skaters, to allow her the flexibility to travel for competition. Liu completes her homework between practices at her father\u2019s nearby office. She eats dinner in the car on the way home and goes to bed around 8.30pm. Despite the rigorous schedule, her father, Arthur Liu told the San Francisco Chronicle, \u201cShe has lots of friends, has sleepovers. I\u2019m trying to provide her with a normal life.\u201d Lipetsky says that despite Liu\u2019s age, she does not coach her any differently. \u201cI want all my students to be able to be the best they can at any level they are in.\u201d -- There are countless cautionary tales about young phenoms burning out, leaving their sport \u2013 or at least taking a break \u2013 seemingly before their time was up.

Frank Capra learned this the excruciating way when presenter Will Rogers announced best director with the words: \u201c\u201cI\u2019ve watched this young man for a long time. Saw him come up from the bottom. It couldn\u2019t have happened to a nicer guy.

Hopefully, the Oscars he subsequently won in 1935, 1937 and 1939 made up for what he called \u201cthe longest, saddest, most shattering walk in my life\u201d. History is made, 1940 Not only was Hattie McDaniel the first African American Oscar winner, for her performance as Mammy in Gone With the Wind, she was the first even to be nominated, after she placed a stack of rave reviews, including the Los Angeles Times writeup of her performance as \u201cworthy of Academy supporting awards\u201d, on the desk of the film\u2019s producer, David O Selznick, who put her name forward to the Academy. The venue, the Cocoanut Grove at the Ambassador hotel, was still segregated and Selznick had to petition for McDaniel to attend. She was seated away from the Gone With the Wind table, at the back of the room. \u201cI sincerely hope I shall always be a credit to my race and to the motion picture industry,\u201d she said in her acceptance speech.

      "bodyText": "Labor has released three bills to crack down on dodgy banks and insurers, increasing political pressure on Scott Morrison and the crossbench to press ahead with the major recommendations of the Hayne royal commission. But the opposition has an internal issue on the future regulation of mortgage brokers, with a discussion during Tuesday\u2019s caucus meeting, spearheaded by the backbench MP Mike Freelander, about the importance of proceeding cautiously with the Hayne recommendation to implement a user-pays system. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, who initially indicated Labor would accept the Hayne recommendation on mortgage brokers \u2013 unlike the government, which expressed reluctance about implementing a user-pays system \u2013 hedged on Tuesday when asked what Labor would do with the politically influential sector, which has launched a lobbying offensive in the wake of the final Hayne report. That lobbying offensive has heightened concerns within Labor about the potentially negative consequences if Hayne-inspired regulations result in a diminution of competition in the home-lending market. Brokers and small banks have warned that an up-front fee, if paid by consumers, would wipe the industry out and decrease competition in the mortgage market. \u201cThe government has said that they\u2019ll get rid of trail commissions and then have a review of up-front commissions but that doesn\u2019t really provide much certainty for the sector\u201d Bowen told reporters. The shadow treasurer said Labor was \u201ctaking our time to carefully consult with all relevant parties and we\u2019ll have more to say in coming days about our proposed approach\u201d. \u201cWe will be fully transparent and explicit in our approach, not only well before the election, but in the immediate future\u201d. Guardian Australia understands the policy under consideration includes replacing trailing commissions with an up-front fee paid by the banks and improved transparency and disclosure of that fee. The chief executive of consumer group Choice, Alan Kirkland, urged parties to \u201cfix one of Australia\u2019s most broken financial services\u201d. \u201cHayne warned us about the influence of conflicted lobbyists \u2013 they have a history of stopping great reform,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the mortgage broking lobbyists out strongly in the last 24 hours, conflating their self-interest with the public interest to try to stop important changes.\u201d The new bills Labor brought forward on Tuesday would remove loopholes in the regulation of funeral expense policies, apply consumer credit protections to salespeople, give the Australian Securities and Investment Commission authority over insurance claims and force banks to cooperate with the bank victims\u2019 complaints authority. Bowen declared the reforms would prevent \u201cshameful exploitation\u201d. Labor followed up in question time with royal commission case studies including costly funeral plans targeting Indigenous Australians and a woman sold a lemon by a car dealership that signed her up for an unsustainable loan. Scott Morrison responded by saying the Coalition would not \u201cengage in reckless legislation\u201d but is responding to all 76 royal commission recommendations \u201cin a measured way, consulting to ensure there are no unintended consequences\u201d. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg ,noted Labor\u2019s bills implemented five recommendations, \u201ca mere 6%\u201d of commissioner Kenneth Hayne\u2019s proposals. He accused Labor of preparing to \u201csmash competition in the housing market\u201d by taking a \u201csledgehammer\u201d to 17,000 mortgage-brokers employing 26,000 people. Labor\u2019s financial services spokeswoman Claire O\u2019Neil said that while some of Hayne\u2019s recommendations were \u201creally complicated\u201d some were \u201cabsolutely simple\u201d. She said there was \u201cno excuse\u201d not to push ahead with reforms contained in the three private members bills, including the promise to end conflicted remuneration of financial planners by repealing grandfathered provisions. Bowen said Labor\u2019s bill would implement that reform by 1 January 2020, \u201ca full year earlier\u201d than the government has promised, after Hayne recommended it be done \u201cas soon as is reasonably practicable\u201d. Labor needs key crossbench MPs including Bob Katter and Andrew Wilkie to commit to extra sitting weeks of parliament in March, or else its private members bills are unlikely to be considered before the election, expected in May. Bill Shorten turned up the pressure on both Morrison and the crossbench, demanding the government explain what it \u201cfinds objectionable\u201d about reforms including \u201cmaking sure that people aren\u2019t getting ripped off in car loans\u201d. Shorten told reporters \u201cthe same\u201d applied to crossbench MPs including Katter. \u201cWe know that there will be problems with insurance records. We know that there will be problems for funeral insurance. We know that there will be problems with dodgy car loans.\u201d \u201cBut [Katter] needs to explain \u2026 Why would we turn a blind eye and let it go for another six months?\u201d Wilkie at first suggested he was in favour of two extra sitting weeks but has since expressed scepticism that substantial reform can be achieved in that time; while Katter threatened to support extra sittings unless the government commits to a rescue package for north Queensland after floods hurt the cattle industry. On Monday, Morrison revealed the government is working on a \u201creconstruction plan\u201d which would deal with existing and future debt, including subsidies for farmers to rebuild their stock.",

      "bodyText": "Labor has threatened to withdraw from a $1bn contract if the Coalition pushes ahead with a controversial plan to privatise the visa processing system before the election. The opposition has consistently opposed the plan, citing the threat to national security, but the shadow finance minister, Jim Chalmers, and immigration spokesman, Shayne Neumann, have upped the ante by warning, if elected, Labor will examine \u201call responsible options\u201d if contracts are signed. The comments are designed to put potential bidders for the $1bn new visa processing system on notice, as well as warn the public service that Labor intends to unwind any deal, in the same way it has signalled it would force the Great Barrier Reef Foundation to return a $443m grant if elected. The decision to outsource visa processing has sparked alarm from the Community and Public Sector Union and the former immigration department deputy secretary Abul Rizvi, who has warned it will lead to increased automation and \u201cpremium\u201d services that could undermine the integrity of the system. In October Rizvi told Guardian Australia the potential for a private provider to create a fast lane for processing had \u201cfrightening\u201d long-term implications, providing an incentive to lower the bar for subjective criteria. Neumann wrote to the home affairs department noting that phase one of the tender is due to close on Wednesday, with successful tenderers finalised by October, after the election. On Tuesday Chalmers told Labor caucus the \u201cmassive outsourcing of government responsibility\u201d should be opposed, including by warning the public service to write provisions into the contract allowing Labor to junk the policy in government. Chalmers told Guardian Australia it would \u201cbe dodgy in the extreme if the Liberals fast-tracked the process and signed contracts before the election\u201d. \u201cIf contracts are signed, and if we win the election, we are giving notice that we will examine all responsible options then with an eye to keeping this service in public hands,\u201d he said. Neumann warned the department in identical terms. He also noted that both Scott Morrison and home affairs minister Peter Dutton had recused themselves from consideration of the tender \u201cdue to conflicts of interest\u201d. Only two prospective tenderers have so far publicly put up their hand for the visa contract: one a consortium from Australia Post and Accenture, and another group led by Scott Briggs, who is the head of Morrison\u2019s federal electorate conference. Chalmers said the government had an \u201cappalling record of handing out big contracts\u201d, citing the $423m Paladin contract signed by the home affairs department due to its \u201curgent\u201d need for security in offshore detention and the contract to the travel company Helloworld, run by a Liberal donor and personal friend of the finance minister, Mathias Cormann. \u201cThey should not make the same mistakes again,\u201d Chalmers said. Chalmers also said this is particularly so when personal friends of the prime minister are involved in the bid. In Senate estimates on Tuesday Cormann said he had no issue with Helloworld being awarded a tender provided all the probity checks were carried out. The Labor MP Julian Hill said \u201cthe very idea of privatising assessment and decisions about who comes and goes from Australia is outrageous\u201d. \u201cThings like character assessment should be done by public servants accountable to ministers, not for-profit companies,\u201d he said. \u201cHow dare the government lecture Labor and run their desperate scare campaign about boats when they\u2019re hellbent on privatising the whole bloody visa system.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, has told Jeremy Corbyn that he must change direction or face a worsening Labour split after seven MPs quit to form a new movement in the party\u2019s biggest schism in nearly 40 years. Watson\u2019s emotional intervention came as a number of Labour MPs were poised to follow the founders of the new Independent Group \u2013 and after reports on Monday night that some Conservatives were also ready to defect. Saying that he sometimes \u201cno longer recognises\u201d his own party, Watson urged Corbyn to ensure Labour remains a broad church and reshuffle his shadow cabinet to reflect a wider balance of MPs. The announcement of the group founded by Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna represented the most significant challenge to party unity since the \u201cgang of four\u201d senior figures quit to form the Social Democratic party in 1981. But on a day of drama, recrimination and occasional chaos, Corbyn loyalists derided the MPs as fringe figures who were out of touch with the public. Umunna directly appealed to MPs from other parties to join the new movement, with attention focused on whether Conservative MPs Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston, Nick Boles, Heidi Allen and at least one pro-EU minister could jump ship, if Theresa May heads towards a no-deal Brexit. Labour MPs also told the Guardian they believe there will be another wave of defections if their party leadership does not move towards a second referendum on Brexit and commit to taking more steps to root out antisemitism from the party. The MPs had been organising for months but they faced embarrassment within hours of the launch when Smith had to apologise for appearing to refer to people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds as having a \u201cfunny tinge\u201d. Corbyn, who has repeatedly faced down leadership challenges, showed little sign of panic. He released a statement saying he was disappointed with their departures but highlighted the popularity of Labour\u2019s recent policies and gains at the 2017 election. He planned to give a speech in London on Tuesday about Brexit and a new commission on lifelong learning, carrying on as normal in the face of the resignations. Some of his allies took a more strident approach, with John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, calling on the MPs to \u201cdo the honourable thing\u201d and resign from parliament to fight byelections.

But the office has struggled since 2014, when it had its resources cut so significantly it was forced to shut down its Canberra office, with its information commissioner forced to work from home. </p> <p>Funding has increased gradually since, but the agency is still operating well below minimum staffing levels it said it needed when it was established, and only has a single statutory officer, rather than the three it originally had. </p> <p>Senate estimates heard on Tuesday that the pressure on the office has continued. It has experienced a 42% increase in requests to review FOI decisions in the past six months. </p> <p>Some cases are now taking as long as 11 months, up from eight months, to assign to an OAIC officer. </p> <p>The information commissioner, <strong>Angelene Falk</strong>, said pressure was also being felt in the agency\u2019s handling of privacy complaints.\u201d</p> <p>For instance, for privacy the allocation time was around seven and a half months, and that\u2019s moved to nine months.</p> <p>\u201cIn FOI, in October last year it was eight and a half months, it\u2019s moved to 11 months. So in terms of addressing that very real issue, we\u2019re working very proactively in terms of the cause of the increased matters, working to seek to ensure that there\u2019s good FOI decision-making happening in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cAt the same time we are looking at our internal processes. We are putting more focus and resources into our early resolution processes, that is bearing fruit.\u201d</p> <p>After questioning by crossbench senator <strong>Rex Patrick</strong>, Falk said the OAIC could use more resources. But she said it was too simplistic to only ask for more resources. </p> <p>Patrick had earlier clashed with assistant home affairs minister, <strong>Linda Reynolds</strong>, and chair, <strong>Ian Macdonald</strong>, after the crossbencher described the situation with the OAIC as a \u201cdisaster\u201d and urged Falk to tell the government she needed more resources. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-19T02:43:49.403Z\">at 2.43am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c6b6b83e4b051cdac4ef938\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-19T02:37:35.359Z\">2.37am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On<strong> Michaelia Cash </strong>and <strong>Michael Keenan, Scott Morrison </strong>had this to say this morning, when talking to Melbourne radio 3AW: </p> <p><strong>Neil Mitchell: </strong>Well what about another case, a former minister and a minister Michael Keenan and Michaelia Cash refusing to cooperate with the police investigation.

They recommended prosecution to the DPP. And the only reason that didn\u2019t occur was because there are about eight people, including minister Cash and minister Keenan, who refused to provide witness statements. </p> <p>Now, no other Australian has the luxury of turning down the police when they ask for a witness statement. </p> <p>But we\u2019ve got two senior cabinet ministers who thumb their nose at the justice system; who thumb their nose at the police and refuse to cooperate by giving a witness statement. </p> <p>Now, today that evidence has been backed up by the DPP. What we\u2019ve learned from the DPP today is that it was their opinion, on the evidence that the AFP forwarded to them, that there was a prima facie case that a crime had been committed, that it was in the public interest for a prosecution to occur. </p> <p>But the only reason it didn\u2019t happen was because they didn\u2019t have enough evidence, particularly because ministers and staffers had refused to give evidence and refused to provide witness statements. So, we\u2019ve got the DPP here. </p> <p>We had the AFP yesterday. The only person who\u2019s missing from this equation, who has any answers, is Michaelia Cash. </p> <p>Now, the time for Michaelia Cash to remain in hiding is over.

Let me bring you a quick summary of the evidence he\u2019s given to date. </p> <p>Cormann has told the hearing he booked three private trips to Singapore by calling the CEO of Helloworld, <strong>Andrew Burnes</strong>, direct. </p> <p>Asked whether it is unusual to book travel by calling the CEO of a travel company on his mobile rather than calling a 1800 number, Cormann said: \u201cI have to say, I\u2019ve got close, personal relationships ... I\u2019ve got a close personal relationship with Mr Burnes and I don\u2019t think it is unusual to ask somebody who owns a business to sell products and services back to you on commercial terms\u201d. </p> <p>Cormann says he has no evidence the travel was provided to him at a discount. He says the travel was never intended to be free. His failure to pay the bill was an oversight. </p> <p>Just to give some quick background on Burnes \u2013 he\u2019s a Liberal party treasurer, and the company has made donations to the Liberal party. Cormann describes him as a friend he sees socially. </p> <p>The finance minister says he had no involvement in a decision to give Burnes\u2019 company a government travel contract, although he has given evidence that the CEO complained to him about the way the finance department was running the tender process. Cormann says he did not pass those complaints on to officials, and he told Burnes to take up his concerns with the bureaucrats. </p> <p>The secretary of the finance department, <strong>Rosemary Huxtable</strong>, says she fielded concerns from Burnes about the process leading to Helloworld being given the contract, but did not pass the concerns on to the procurement team because he didn\u2019t want to make a formal complaint. She says she didn\u2019t make notes of the conversation. Huxtable says the only time she\u2019s ever discussed the tender with Cormann was last night, when he sought particulars as part of answering questions from Fairfax Media. </p> <p>Cormann says he has no issue with a company, with close links to the Liberal party, being awarded a tender provided all the probity checks were carried out. </p> <p>He says companies able to provide services at competitive cost should not be excluded from bidding for government work because some of their personnel participate in the democratic process. </p> <p>\u201cYou are saying taxpayers of the commonwealth should have to pay more,\u201d he says. </p> <p>The finance minister also pointed out that Labor awarded a contract to Helloworld when it was last in office. Cormann says the latest contract extracted savings. </p> <p><strong>Penny Wong</strong> editorialises that the whole arrangement looks \u201ccosy and comfortable\u201d. Cormann says the contract was \u201cmerit-based\u201d. </p> <p>The committee is taking a lunch break now.

As soon as practical. The government\u2019s response says they\u2019ll get around to it on January 1, 2021. That\u2019s not as soon as practical. We believe it can be done on January 1, 2020, and it legislated now. Give people time to adjust. Give people, planners and the financial sector time to implement it. It\u2019s straightforward legislation which can be achieved now. </p> <p>It can be achieved a full 12 months in advance of what the government\u2019s proposed timetable is. That is not as soon as practical. The government is not achieving that recommendation. They say they\u2019re taking action on all recommendations well, they\u2019re taking more action on some than others. There\u2019s 14 that they\u2019re not implementing. </p> <p>This is one of them where they\u2019re falling short. We can do better. </p> <p>Secondly: In a royal commission full of disturbing evidence, some of the most harrowing was in relation to funeral insurance, which is exempt from protections under the Act, protections under the law at the moment. Particularly concerning was the conduct of some in relation to funeral insurance with our Indigenous community. No other word than shameful exploitation. </p> <p>That should not go on one day longer. The legislation we\u2019ll put in will go on royal ascent - in other words, immediately. There is no excuse for this kind of behaviour to carry on until August or later in the year. It should stop immediately. </p> <p>We\u2019re prepared to legislate it in coming days and for it to apply from royal ascent, from the time that the government can send it to the governor general for approval after it was approved by both houses of parliament, which could be done, with a bit of good will from the government. </p> <p>Now, these are two practical steps which we\u2019re getting on with. We\u2019ve taken our time to work through, based on thorough legal advice, what can be quickly implemented, keeping with the royal commission recommendations. </p> <p>We\u2019ve done that consultation, we\u2019ve done that work and we believe that these are elements that can be implemented immediately. There are other things we accept and I\u2019ve said from the outset, that are more complicated and will take more time and need more complicated drafting and consultation. But even the royal commission doesn\u2019t recommend it is done urgently. </p> <p>There are some in that category but others that we should be getting on with now.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-19T01:01:23.253Z\">at 1.01am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c6b4fcae4b0793c8d0b19a8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-19T00:45:21.818Z\">12.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Kimberley Kitching</strong>: Is this the only discussion you have had with Mr Burnes relating to travel where he\u2019s also taken your travel booking?</p> <p><strong>Mathias Cormann</strong>: I believe that I\u2019ve booked travel through Helloworld on three occasions and on each occasion, the payment, I\u2019ve verified, the payment was processed.</p> <p>Then<strong> Penny Wong</strong> got involved.</p> <p>PW: I think that Senator Kitching\u2019s question went to ... I mean, it is an unusual thing to call someone at his level to book flights. That says something about the relationship, Senator Cormann. But I think the question went to \u2013 how many times did you actually transact with, is it the CEO, of this large company, for the flights?</p> <p>MC: On three occasions.</p> <p>PW: So all of your personal travel, you ring him?</p> <p>MC: Well, in more recent times, that\u2019s right. </p> <p>And then <strong>Jenny McAllister</strong> picks up the questioning.</p> <p>JA: But not just through Helloworld, sorry. You don\u2019t just ring one of their employees, you ring the boss. Is that how it works?</p> <p>MC: Well, he was my contact that I knew at Helloworld and I made travel arrangements through him. Through his office.</p> <p>JA: That\u2019s an odd arrangement.</p> <p>MC: Well ...</p> <p>Labor: So how did it work? Did you say: I\u2019ve got the following dates available for travel? Or my family does? And he went through and found the flights for you? This is all on the phone? How did the conversation work?</p> <p>MC: The way that it would work is that I would ask for travel bookings to be made and for me to be invoiced and charged. You know, obviously I don\u2019t know what the arrangements are within his office.</p> <p>JA: Minister, it is a very unusual arrangement. Most Australians don\u2019t have a direct line to the CEO of a travel company to arrange their travel bookings. How did the arrangement come out between yourself and Mr Burnes? Did he offer to facilitate your travel? Or did you approach him about becoming your travel agent?</p> <p>MC: Well, Helloworld is a travel business.</p> <p>JA: They are. But they don\u2019t advertise the CEO\u2019s phone number, broadly, for general public use. So I\u2019m wondering about the circumstances that see you phoning the CEO of an organisation?</p> <p>MC: The circumstances that I organised to travel and I booked travel and I paid for it?</p> <p>Labor: How do you know Mr Burnes?</p> <p>MC: Well, I\u2019ve known him over the years. It\u2019s a matter of public record that he has been involved in the Liberal party for some time.</p> <p>Labor: So how far back does your association with him go?</p> <p>MC: I\u2019d have to take that on notice. I think ... From ... six or seven years, perhaps.<br></p> <p>Labor: But it\u2019s only in recent times that you\u2019ve commenced booking with him directly?</p> <p>MC: Well, the trips would have been in the last three or so years, yes.</p> <p>Labor: Right, so some time in the last three years, you moved away from whoever had previously been navigating your travel for you and you started phoning Mr Burnes directly?</p> <p>MC: I made travel bookings through Helloworld, that\u2019s right.</p> <p>Labor: And again I ask you, who initiated the arrangement? Where the CEO would be available to you, personally, to take your call, in relation to your family holiday bookings?</p> <p>MC: To be fair, in more recent times, I had more interaction with him in the context, obviously, of his involvement with the Liberal party and that is where the occasion arose where I was able to make those bookings.</p> <p>Labor: And did he offer to you, or did you ask him, to establish such an arrangement?</p> <p>MC: Well, I take responsibilities for having made the bookings if that is the question.</p> <p>JA: I\u2019m asking you more broadly about the arrangement. When you call him, do you call him on his mobile?</p> <p>MC: Um ... I think it varies. It varies.</p> <p>Labor: So you\u2019ve got all of his contact details?</p> <p>MC: Well, I run into him from time to time.</p> <p>Labor: Where did you meet?</p> <p>MC: Sorry?</p> <p>Labor: Where did you meet? Did you meet at a Liberal party function? Where did you meet?</p> <p>MC: I\u2019ve known him over the years. I mean, he\u2019s been involved ... I can\u2019t remember the first meeting. I honestly can\u2019t.<br></p> <p>Labor: So, there is a point, though, where somehow, between the two of you, it becomes ... Ordinary people ring Helloworld through a 1800 number, I suppose. I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t attempted to do it. But you ring the CEO on his personal mobile. I\u2019m trying to understand how you came to be in such a relationship with Mr Burnes, where it was possible for you to ring him on his personal mobile and he would write down your credit card details?</p> <p>MC: Well, as I\u2019ve said, I\u2019ve known him for a number of years, going all the way back to the opposition years and obviously, it\u2019s a matter of public record that he\u2019s been involved at senior levels in the Liberal party for some time, which, incidentally, didn\u2019t prevent his company from securing a contract through a merit-based proper tender process under the period of the previous Labor government.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-19T00:49:25.103Z\">at 12.49am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c6b4e41e4b0793c8d0b19a1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-19T00:35:48.365Z\">12.35am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And then the answers take a turn, with Mathias Cormann admitting he has booked his trips through the Helloworld CEO and Liberal party treasurer, <strong>Andrew Burnes.

I personally supplied my credit card details. I personally gave the instruction for the flight booking to be charged to my credit card. I thought that that had happened, but you know, I know that the question is going to be asked \u2013 didn\u2019t you keep an eye on your credit card?</p> <p>I should have, is the truthful answer, but what I would offer by way of explanation, if not by way of an excuses that with the extensive travel that I do undertake on a weekly basis, there\u2019s a lot of travel-related expenditure that goes through my credit card and having made the booking, having given and having provided the credit card details and given the instruction for the payment to be deducted, I assumed that that had happened. </p> <p>The travel did not take place until sometime later and certainly, by the time that the ... that I undertook the travel, I was 100% confident that payment had been made. In fact, when the issue was first brought to my attention yesterday, I was 100% confident that payment had been made until I was confronted with some information which was sent to me from within an internal system of the Helloworld business which led me to, of course, in my understanding ... I hasten to adhere, and I\u2019ve addressed this in my statement. At no point did I receive any reminders of an outstanding payment required. So as far as I was concerned, I had provided my credit card details when the booking was made and I assumed that the payment had been processed and you know, my experience in general terms, if I have forgotten to pay something, I do get reminder notices. It does happen, it can happen from time to time when you\u2019re on the road a lot. </p> <p>But I did not receive any reminder notices over an extended period until such time that it was raised with me yesterday, and on verification, I ascertained the facts that I outlined in my statement and as soon as I became aware that the payment remained outstanding I made sure that the payment was processed immediately. There can\u2019t be any suggestions at all that this was ever intended to be free travel or that it was free travel. It wasn\u2019t. There was obviously a charge carried in the system and within the business against that travel, a charge that I assumed had been processed against my credit card, but it turns out that it hadn\u2019t.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-19T00:36:52.414Z\">at 12.36am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c6b4bcbe4b079bb67ae2b30\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-19T00:21:09.507Z\">12.21am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/19/morrison-defends-mathias-cormann-over-free-flights-for-family-holiday\"><strong>Mathias Cormann</strong>\u2019<strong>s </strong>travel</a> is the latest subject in the finances estimates hearing. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-19T00:23:30.386Z\">at 12.23am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c6b4b56e4b0793c8d0b1992\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-19T00:19:07.849Z\">12.19am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Bob Katter</strong> also received a \u201cPratt\u201d cap as a \u201cpresent from the prime minister this morning\u201d.

By bringing all political actors in line with the same requirements political parties face, the Morrison government believes transparency in our political system will be increased.</p> <p>I also note GetUp\u2019s claims of independence. There is a substantial body of material showing GetUp acting in the direct interest of Labor and the Greens. Eighty-seven per cent of GetUp\u2019s past and present directors have a connection to Labor, the Greens, the trade union movement or leftwing organisations. GetUp\u2019s political activity is fundamentally aimed at campaigning against Coalition MPs and candidates exclusively. No one should be fooled by false claims of independence.</p> <p>The community rightfully expects transparency in the funding arrangements of any organisation that seeks to influence Australian elections.

I think you can expect to see a few education announcements floating around tomorrow ahead of the delivery. Of course, estimates rolls on, as does the House. We saw a pivot in attack from the government today, with question time focussed on franking credits, rather than border security. But as the Nauru decision starts to sink in, I think we can expect to see a bit more tomorrow about the medical evacuation bill as well. A massive thank you to Mike Bowers, even if he did eat my soup today, and of course, to Katharine Murphy and Paul Karp, and the rest of the Guardian brains trust that keep this little blog ticking over. And to you, for reading, commenting and following along. I may not get to all of the messages, but I try. We do appreciate you joining us every sitting day and hope to see you back here tomorrow morning. In the meantime \u2013 take care of you. You can see why Julia Banks had to start her question again in this. In Senate estimates, attorney general\u2019s department deputy secretary Ian Anderson has revealed small business minister Michaelia Cash\u2019s legal bill for the AWU matter has so far been ... $288,812. It is routine for the commonwealth (taxpayers, i.e. you) to pay minister\u2019s legal bills if litigation relates to their work as a minister. The attorney general approved the spending and the costs are certified by the department (presumably to ensure we\u2019re all getting value for money!) Anderson said that Cash is the only minister with taxpayer-funded legal costs approved. Rachel Siewert said evidence from an estimates hearing today has shown a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in Administrative Appeals Tribunal cases regarding Centrelink. Siewert said there had been: \u2022 77% increase in appeals relating to the Disability Support Pension (DSP) \u2022 41% increase in appeals relating to Newstart \u2022 34% increase in appeals relating to Youth Allowance There was also a 75% increase in appeals relating to the NDIS. \u201cThis is deeply concerning, successive governments have attempted to make it harder and harder for people to access the social safety net and this is particularly clear when it comes to the DSP\u201d, she said in a statement. \u201cGiven the on-line compliance program, the punitive approach to Jobseekers and the demonisation of people on DSP, I\u2019m not surprised there has been an increase in appeals. \u201cThe overhaul of the DSP eligibility criteria and new assessment process has meant that there is greater difficulty in accessing this payment\u201d Would it even be Australia if someone wasn\u2019t sticking a ruler into the ocean to protest climate change? Brendan O\u2019Connor from a little earlier: We\u2019ve had two cabinet ministers refuse to respond to requests, multiple requests, from the Australian federal police to provide witness statements which is in part reason for the inability of the director of public prosecutions to charge people for the criminal conduct in leaking that information. The prime minister misled the House today in saying that the ministers fully cooperated. And the minister for home affairs also misled the House today when he indicated that the ministers in question had provided statements. So we have the prime minister and the minister for home affairs misleading the parliament about the conduct of Minister Cash and Minister Keenan in relation to their failure to respond to the request by the Australian federal police to provide witness statements in relation to the criminal offence that occurred by the leaking of information to the media in relation to those union raids. This is something that should be resolved by the prime minister. He should compel both Minister Keenan and Minister Cash to provide witness statements to the AFP as they requested. That would allow sufficient evidence quite possibly, sufficient evidence for the commonwealth director of public prosecutions to charge someone for a criminal offence.\u201d From the chamber a few moments ago: Integrity campaigners have welcomed parliament\u2019s passing of new protections designed to shield corporate whistleblowers from recrimination. The bill strengthens the protections available to corporate whistleblowers on a number of fronts. It makes it easier for them to retain protection if they choose to go to the media when their efforts to speak up internally go nowhere. It also requires large companies to have their own whistleblower policies, and makes a company liable to pay compensation for any reprisals against the whistleblower. The current system only protects whistleblowers if such reprisals meet the high standard of \u201ccriminal\u201d victimisation. The bill passed the Senate on Tuesday, a development welcomed by integrity expert Prof AJ Brown, an expert with Griffith University, and crossbench senator, Rex Patrick, both of whom were key in pushing the bill forward. Brown tweeted the new laws were a \u201chuge step and breakthrough for stronger compensation rights, the duty to support &amp; protect, &amp; public interest disclosure\u201d. Patrick thanked the Coalition and jobs minister, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, for what he said was a collaborative effort. \u201cThese historic and world leading whistleblower protections will empower employees to call out unethical behaviour in their workplaces without fear of repercussions,\u201d Patrick said. Adani has responded to the Queensland department of environment and science\u2019s final report into its planned Galilee coal mine, and the fate of the Black-throated finch that lives in the area (spoiler, Adani is NOT happy): \u201cLate last night Queensland Government\u2019s Department of Environment and Science sent us the final report from the external review of our Black-throated Finch Management Plan. \u201cTo say we\u2019re disappointed in the final version is an understatement. The department has ignored the feedback that we provided to them last week on the plan and has not addressed the issues we raised. \u201cThe final report still contains false and inaccurate statements about the management plan, including hysterical claims on local extinction, which directly conflict with the scientific advice the Queensland and Australian governments have relied upon to date. \u201cWe reject the report and its findings in their entirety. The report still contains unverified opinions regarding climate change and other projects in the Galilee Basin which are completely outside the scope of the Black-throated Finch Management Plan. \u201cThis still reads as an anti-Adani lobbying document, dressed up as science. \u201cWe note that one of the few things that has changed from the draft to the final version, is the removal of formal references to the work of April Reside, a person who has been actively campaigning against the Carmichael Project for years. \u201cOn many occasions we have stated our grave concerns that a person such as Prof Brendan Wintle who leads an organisation with individuals who have made anti-coal, anti-mining and anti-Adani statements in the past, could not possibly lead a review of our Black-throated Finch Management Plan without such strongly held views prejudicing the contents of the report. \u201cWe remain committed to advancing our project and to this end we will continue to work with the Queensland Government so that these plans can be concluded and we can get on with delivering the thousands of jobs our project will deliver. \u201cOne thing is for certain \u2013 we\u2019re not going anywhere. We\u2019re committed to the regions. We\u2019re committed to providing desperately needed jobs. We\u2019re committed to delivering the Carmichael Project for regional Queensland. \u201cThe Queensland Government keeps shifting the goal posts for Adani. We are simply seeking a fair go.\u201d For the record: In finishing, Wayne Swan tells his colleagues to \u201cnot be too confident\u201d. He also pays tribute to Bill Shorten and his senior frontbenchers for the new lease of unity they have brought to the party. Here is what the chamber looks like right now: \u201cYou don\u2019t feel the bullets you dodge, and we dodged a big one,\u201d Wayne Swan says, of the GFC. Wayne Swan says the Labor government navigated Australia through the global financial crisis \u201cthrough choice, not by chance\u201d. \u201cWe knew from the failures of the 1930s and the 1990s, what recessions do,\u201d he says. \u201c...We also know it takes a decade or more to recover ... not learning those lessons would be ignorant.\u201d He said that is why the government rejected austerity policies to get through the GFC. Wayne Swan pays tribute to Julia Gillard and says it was a great honour to serve under the first female prime minister. He also says how happy he is to have a woman, Anika Wells, replace him as the candidate for Lilley. Wayne Swan is on his feet, talking about his career, which included eight election wins and one loss, since 1993. Or as he describes it, enough days to cover almost four continuous years of parliament. Wayne Swan says yesterday was his 35th wedding anniversary, and two hours ago, he became a grandfather again. So it\u2019s a good week to be Wayne Swan. The Australian Financial Review has tracked down the Paladin office. From the Tom McIlroy, Jonathan Shapiro, Angus Grigg and Lisa Murray report: Paladin, the security firm at the centre of the $423m contract scandal, has a secret office in Canberra, just three kilometres from Parliament House. The Australian Financial Review visited an office location near the fashionable Kingston Foreshore precinct in which Paladin staff are based. That address, however, is different to the Canberra location that was provided to corporate regulators as the company\u2019s registered office and principal place of business, in a filing last week.\u201d The peak industry body for nursing homes has defended lobbying the federal government to drop references to \u201ccomfortable internal temperature\u201d in new regulations for aged care operators. Draft standards contained the reference but the final regulations, which come into force in July, do not. Leading Age Services Australia in its submission responding to the draft regulations said: \u201cThis may be interpreted that all services are required to have air-conditioning. This needs to be clarified in the rationale and evidence section.\u201d Chief executive Sean Rooney was grilled about the issue at the royal commission into the aged care sector in Adelaide on Tuesday. \u201cThey should have appropriate cooling and heating to meet the needs of (residents) and provide a comfortable environment,\u201d he said. Rooney said there \u201ccould well be locations\u201d that air-conditioning is not a requirement at nursing homes. Under further questioning from senior counsel assisting Timothy McEvoy, Rooney was unable to name a single location. \u201cThere\u2019s many ways to cool a room, air-conditioning is bar one,\u201d he said. Rooney said locations and building design may play a part in keeping residents cool. \u201cAll we sought was clarification from government as to whether the requirement is all aged care facilities have air-conditioning,\u201d he said. McEvoy responded: \u201cYou\u2019ve succeeded in clarifying it out haven\u2019t you?\u201d Rooney disagreed saying under the new standards nursing homes must provide an environment that is comfortable and meets the needs of residents and staff. From Mike Bowers\u2019 lens to your eyeballs: Wayne Swan will be delivering his valedictory at 4.10. As Luke said a little earlier, this is not going away: Has Julia Banks suffered from a pocket tweet? Speaking of Brendan O\u2019Connor, he has announced another doorstop interview, this time for 3.45. I\u2019m sure you can guess at the topic. Labor\u2019s employment spokesman, Brendan O\u2019Connor, is not letting up on the Michaelia Cash issue. A few hours after he released a statement that simply said \u201cSenate Estimates is on. Where is Minister Cash?\u201d, O\u2019Connor has now written to the secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Martin Parkinson, asking for an investigation. You might remember the AFP told estimates yesterday Cash and Michael Keenan, who was then justice minister, declined to be interviewed about how the 2017 AWU police raids were leaked to the media. The police chose not to lay charges citing insufficient evidence. Cash told the court last week she was asked to provide a voluntary statement \u2013 and did provide a copy of the Hansard. The police told estimates yesterday this was insufficient to be a witness statement. O\u2019Connor claims that Cash and Keenan \u2013 whose office was implicated in the leaks in court last week alongside Cash\u2019s \u2013 should be investigated for failing to meet ministerial standards. \u201cMinister Cash and Keenan\u2019s refusal to participate in this AFP investigation raises serious questions about their compliance with the high standards of accountability required by ministers under the statement of ministerial standards,\u201d O\u2019Connor wrote to Parkinson. Tony Smith announces that the clerk of the House, David Elder has called time on his working life in the parliament. He\u2019s been here for 38 years, five years as the clerk. He\u2019s asked for no speeches, today, Smith says, but he gets a round of applause from the chamber. Scott Morrison ends question time. With only a handful of mentions of the chum bucket. Bob Katter has just walked into question time. He is addressing his fellow crossbenchers. It looks like they are getting Bobsplained, given their expressions. Brendan O\u2019Connor to Scott Morrison: Today, the prime minister told the House that neither minister Cash or the human services minister received any further requests for information from the AFP. But the AFP yesterday told Senate estimates the ministers were asked twice to provide witness statements, and they refused to do so. Who\u2019s right, Prime Minister? The Prime Minister, or the Australian federal police? Morrison: The reality, Mr Speaker \u2013 as the commissioner pointed out yesterday, or the deputy commissioner, Leanne Close, pointed out yesterday \u2013 there was a request made to the respective ministers. They provided a statement to the AFP, and that was it, Mr Speaker.\u201d Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: I refer to the Prime Minister\u2019s previous answer. Did the government use the same processes that it followed when it gave an almost $500m contract to the secretive Paladin Group, and is following in the government\u2019s privatisation of visa processing, where one of the tenderers is run by a company run by a friend of the prime minister? Morrison: Well, the member for Rankin\u2019s got his hands so deep in that chum bucket now, Mr Speaker, it will be smelling and smelling and smelling for weeks. I know the member for Rankin has been looking very, very cocky lately, because the member for McMahon \u2013 the weakest link in the Labor party \u2013 has been under siege, Mr Speaker. No-one\u2019s happier than the member for Rankin for the member for McMahon\u2019s failures when it comes to his taxation policies for the member for Goldstein, the committee and the Treasurer have been exposing. And I refer the member to the comments by the Minister for Home Affairs, and he should take his hands out of the chum bucket. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: On 16 August 2017, the finance minister signed off on this brief about awarding a multimillion-dollar whole-of-government contract to a subsidiary of Helloworld. Can the prime minister guarantee to this House that the awarding of this contract involved no conflicts? Morrison: I refer the member to the minister for finance\u2019s statement, to the finance and public administration committee in his media release today, and I table that release, which goes to the issue that the member has raised. Mr Speaker, I make this point. You always know when Labor\u2019s in trouble, because they go to the bottom of the chum bucket as usual, Mr Speaker. They\u2019ve got the drawer over there \u2013 the low drawer, the one right down the bottom. And when this leader of the Labor party is in trouble, when he\u2019s under pressure, whether it\u2019s because of his failed decision and weakness on border protection, or the fact he wants to put $200bn on of higher taxes on older Australians, and he\u2019s caught out by the excellent work of the treasurer and the member for Goldstein and the other members of the House committee on economics \u2013 what do Labor do? They go to that bottom draw and they start chucking the mud, Mr Speaker. You always know when Labor are in trouble \u2013 they start slinging the mud. Plankton would be so proud. His establishment, mentioned in the Hansard. Labor is still rolling its eyes at Tim Wilson asking about franking credits. Someone who didn\u2019t get thrown out for an interjection was Ed Husic, who, as Josh Frydenberg finished his answer, called out \u201cwritten and authorised by Geoff Wilson\u201d. Oh the lols in this place. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: Can he assure the House that every one of his ministers \u2013 including Minister Cormann, and every minister sitting behind him \u2013 has fully complied with the high standards required of ministers in his Statement of Ministerial Standards in all of their dealings with Andrew Burnes and his businesses? (This is a question about Matthias Cormann admitting he has booked holidays by calling the CEO of the travel company Helloworld directly. The CEO, Andrew Burnes, is also Liberal party treasurer.) Morrison: I\u2019m advised there\u2019s nothing before me that would conflict with the question that the member just put to me. Mark Butler to Scott Morrison: Labor has repeatedly called on the prime minister to schedule extra sitting weeks so that recommendations of the banking royal commission can be implemented before the election. Today, it\u2019s reported that the Minister for Agriculture said the government couldn\u2019t legislate its so-called \u201cbig-stick energy laws\u201d because it had run out of sitting days. If the \u201cbig stick\u201d is really so critical, why won\u2019t the prime minister schedule extra sitting days? Is it because the prime minister has lost control of the parliament, or because \u2013 after 11 failed attempts in three years \u2013 this government and parliament\u2019s policy on energy... Butler runs out of time, but you get the gist. Scott Morrison: The government\u2019s policy is to hold the big energy companies to account. We will stand with the Australian people to ensure they get the best possible deal for the energy companies. He introduces the minister for energy, Angus Taylor. Angus Taylor: Mr Speaker, for years now, we have seen the big energy companies putting through sneaky late payments \u2013 sneaky premiums being charged to customers \u2013 because they pay an hour late or a day late. Mr Speaker, this is absolutely unacceptable behaviour, and we will not stand for it. We\u2019ve seen customers paying as much as $1,000 a year extra because of these dodgy practices from the big energy companies. Mr Speaker, we\u2019re passing through a whole series of changes to keep the big energy companies to account. You voted against them 11 times, Mr Speaker. 11 times. We, on this side of the House, sit on the side of the hardworking small businesses, the hardworking households of Australia. Those opposite sit on the side of the big energy companies. Craig Kelly has the next dixer and you can tell he definitely wrote it himself by how he is reading every single word straight off the piece of paper in front of him. There is some problem with the microphone, but no one notices at first, because Kelly has often displayed the unique ability to not understand how microphones work\u2013 that is, you don\u2019t have to yell into them, because its one job is to amplify your voice. Brendan O\u2019Connor to Scott Morrison: Today in Senate estimates, the director of public prosecutions said that a factor preventing the prosecution of a leak of the AFP raid was a failure of people to provide witness statements. Will the prime minister order minister Cash and the minister for human services to provide witness statements to the police and fully cooperate with the police so that whoever has broken the law can be brought to justice? Morrison: I can say I am advised that ministers were invited, on a voluntary basis, to assist the AFP in their investigation. I\u2019m advised that both ministers did, in fact, cooperate with that investigation on a voluntary basis. I\u2019m advised that neither minister received any further requests for information after they responded to the AFP\u2019s initial invitation to provide information. The ministers have cooperated with the AFP investigation. There are interjections from behind me encouragingly to advise the House: \u2018What is this matter actually in to?\u2019 The matter is into the AWU\u2019s providing of member fees to GetUp and, indeed, the leader of the Labor party, Mr Speaker. That\u2019s what it is. And the questioner has asked me that, if there are people responsible for things, then this should be exposed. Well, they should! So why won\u2019t the leader of the Labor party come clean and provide the evidence which shows \u2013 allegedly he believes it does \u2013 that this didn\u2019t happen? Mr Speaker, the biggest obstacle to this investigation is the leader of the opposition, who refuses to come clean on the very serious allegations that the union that he was running and involved with, Mr Speaker, directed members\u2019 fees to GetUp and, indeed, his own campaigns, Mr Speaker. Why doesn\u2019t he come clean? Margaret Thatcher quote. DRINK Josh Frydenberg finishes his answer to Bowen with: \u201cThe Labor party is being found wanting.\u201d Which just makes me think of the very underrated Heath Ledger movie, A Knight\u2019s Tale, where every character, at one point of another, has been weighed, measured and found wanting. Chris Bowen to Scott Morrison: Earlier in question time, the prime minister called Labor\u2019s proposed laws to clean up the banks \u201creckless\u201d \u2013 just like he called the very idea of a royal commission \u201creckless\u201d as he was voting against it 26 times. When will the prime minister learn his lesson, apologise to the Australian people for voting against a royal commission 26 times, and schedule extra sitting weeks to work with Labor to finally clean up the banks? Josh Frydenberg gets the nod: (please refer to every other question on this for the past two days) Tim Wilson gets a dixer on franking credits. Mark Dreyfus is booted for interjecting \u201chow are your shares going?\u201d \u201cIs this questioned sponsored by anyone\u201d gets Brian Mitchell kicked out. Josh Frydenberg starts his answer with \u201cwhat a fantastic job he has done\u201d Really, this whole dixer is the ultimate troll. Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison: \u201cAfter the terrible, devastating floods recently in Townsville \u2013 and, indeed, throughout North Queensland \u2013 thousands of Australians will be making insurance claims for damage to houses, to livestock, and other losses. Why won\u2019t the Prime Minister schedule extra sitting days so this parliament can debate and pass laws to force insurance companies to treat their customers fairly?\u201d Morrison: \u201cThere\u2019s really nowhere you won\u2019t go, is there, to try and make political points?\u201d the PM says. The Labor side of the chamber goes nuts, and then the government side goes nuts, and then we move on. \u201cThere\u2019s really nowhere this leader of the Labor Party won\u2019t go... I mean, honestly.\u201d Morrison moves back to border protection.... \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you one thing that we\u2019ve also had to deal with and we\u2019ve had to be distracted by. That\u2019s this leader of the opposition coming in here and voting for a bill \u2013 voting for a bill \u2013 to weaken our border protection that will cost this country $500m in the next two years. I would have preferred to put that money into supporting people in North Queensland. This leader of the Labor party came in here and committed Australia to $1.4bn to reopen detention centres, to clean up his mess.\u201d Julia Banks has the crossbench question and its to the minister for health. It takes a beat or two for the government benches to realise that Banks is asking Greg Hunt a question \u2013 the Greg Hunt she is challenging. Tony Pasin, who appears to have learnt gum-chewing lessons from the local cow paddock, is particularly exercised by this development. The interjections from the government benches are so loud, Banks has to start again. Could the minister explain to the people in my electorate of Chisholm, and to the people in his electorate of Flinders, who are concerned about his role leading to environmental and climate change inaction, as to what he has actually done to address environmental health issues when the Medical Journal Of Australia and countless doctors and health professionals state that climate change inaction \u2013 in which he has played a significant role \u2013 threatens the lives and health of all Australians? \u201cGood question,\u201d yells Labor. Hunt: I could not be more delighted to receive this question from the member for Chisholm on this topic. The reason why is because, when we came into government, we were left with a gap of 750m tonnes to close our 2020 target. We didn\u2019t just close that gap in terms of emissions. We are now 368m tonnes in surplus. In other words, we have turned around, from Labor\u2019s position, Australia\u2019s emissions profile for 2020 by 1.1bn tonnes. But we also inherited a Barrier Reef that was on the world heritage in-danger watch list. Labor put it on, and we took it off. Labor put it on, and we took it off. As the prime minister said at the Press Club, \u201cWe are achieving our targets.\u201d Those targets were set by the people on the other side \u2013 the very targets...\u201d Banks interjects on the grounds of relevance, but the Speaker, Tony Smith, says the reference to climate change was broad enough for Hunt to answer as he sees fit. \u201cHear, hear,\u201d yell MPs on the government benches. Hunt mentions targets again \u201cYou\u2019re the target,\u201d yell Labor MPs. Tony Burke asks Hunt to table the \u201cwatch list\u201d, \u201cbecause it doesn\u2019t exist\u201d but Hunt isn\u2019t holding any documents to table. Tanya Plibersek to Scott Morrison: My question is to the Prime Minister: Tracy, who works in an Aboriginal cooperative, told the royal commission she was conned into paying more than $10,000 in funeral insurance premiums for a policy that was only worth $8,000. The dodgy company that sold Tracy this insurance used misleading marketing to trick her into believing that it was backed by the Aboriginal community. Why won\u2019t the prime minister schedule extra sitting weeks before the election so this parliament can stop dodgy insurers ripping off Australians? Morrison: It\u2019s a very serious issue, and it requires a very serious response. That\u2019s what the government is doing in responding and taking action on all 76 recommendations of the royal commission. We will do so in a way that follows the proper process of getting legislation right, Mr Speaker. The Labor party have had 15 days to respond to the royal commission, and what they announced today, it sounds like they spent 15 minutes, Mr Speaker, putting it together. The Labor Party cannot be trusted with these very sensitive matters. They demonstrated that last time they were in government, and they would do so again if given the chance. Michael McCormack is Michael McCormacking the chamber. He does come up with this though: \u201cLabor spent money on children in detention centres. We spent money on children in public schools.\u201d He\u2019s getting louder, which means its almost over. Chris Bowen to Scott Morrison: A mother of two told the royal commission that, after being knocked back for a car loan by eight different lenders, a car dealership offered her a loan despite her small income and big credit-card debt. She was sold a lemon, fell behind in her payments, and Westpac found that she never should have been given the loan in the first place. Why won\u2019t the prime m inister schedule more sitting weeks before the election so that this parliament can legislate the recommendations of the banking royal commission? Josh Frydenberg takes it: I thank the member for McMahon for his reference to Hayne recommendations 1.7, Mr Speaker, which is about removing the point-of-sale exemption for responsible lending obligations. I can tell the member for McMahon that we agree with this recommendation in full, Mr Speaker. But we also recognise that this recommendation needs to be carefully implemented because it will impact on thousands of Australian businesses, Mr Speaker. So after discussions with the ... Mr Speaker, after ... talking to the Treasury Implementation Task Force about the various recommendations from the Hayne royal commission, this is one which we really need to carefully work through the implementation. It will require a consultation paper and discussion with key stakeholders. Mr Speaker, it was interesting that, when the Labor Party at this doorstop earlier today announced that they were going to provide part responses to just 6% of the Hayne recommendations, there was the conspicuous absence of any talk about Labor\u2019s position on mortgage-brokers, Mr Speaker. On mortgage-brokers. And that is because the member for Hotham \u2013 who has now left the chamber \u2013 went out publicly and said the Labor party will implement every single recommendation of Hayne, Mr Speaker. He goes on to talk about mortgage brokers. Clare O\u2019Neil is booted. The first dixer is something along the lines of just how strong is this strong government, and is the prime minister aware of any alternatives that may not be as strong? You will not be surprised to hear that the prime minister is very aware of alternatives. Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison: Today, Labor has three bills ready to implement recommendations from the banking royal commission. When will the prime minister stop running a part-time parliament and schedule extra sitting days so Labor\u2019s bills can become law before the next election? Why is the prime minister putting the banks ahead of the people, just like he did when he voted against the banking royal commission 26 times? Scott Morrison: I\u2019ll ask the treasurer to add further to this answer. What the government is not go to do is engage in reckless legislation. We will engage in responding to all 76 of the recommendations of the royal commission, and we\u2019re going to do it in a measured way, consulting to ensure there are no unintended consequences. Because our government doesn\u2019t engage in reckless legislation, Mr Speaker. Our government doesn\u2019t do that. What the leader of the Labor party did in this place last week was to engage in reckless legislation to undermine Australia\u2019s border protection regime. We\u2019re already seeing the unintended consequences of it already, Mr Speaker. He didn\u2019t think about it when it was voted on in the Senate, or here. He demonstrated his weakness, Mr Speaker. The leader of the Labor party cannot be trusted with Australia\u2019s future. Josh Frydenberg: This is what a response to the royal commission looks like, Mr Speaker. (He waves the government\u2019s response). Not a doorstop with a couple of suggestions, Mr Speaker. The leader of the opposition, knowing that there were 76 recommendations, held a doorstop and announced part responses to \u2013 how many? Five, Mr Speaker. A mere 6%. And the member for Hotham proudly went out on ABC Radio and said that the Labor party would provide a comprehensive response within a week, Mr Speaker. It\u2019s now two weeks later, and we have yet to see a response. It goes on, but I can not. Dementia Australia chief executive, Maree McCabe, has called for mandatory dementia education for aged care workers. She told the royal commission hearing in Adelaide on Tuesday that half the population of Australian nursing home residents have dementia and thousands remain undiagnosed. However the workforce of 240,000 aged care staff nationally are unprepared to deal with dementia patients. She said 70% are personal carers and their training doesn\u2019t provide any specific dementia education. \u201cOne of the key things about education is about developing empathy,\u201d McCabe told the hearing. Meanwhile, Aged &amp; Community Services Australia, a peak body for not-for-profit nursing homes, raised concerns about red tape stopping elderly residents enjoying small freedoms. Chief executive Pat Sparrow told the commission elderly people under the current system weren\u2019t being given the opportunity to experience \u201cthe dignity of risk\u201d. She said in some cases residents who want to go to buy an ice-cream from a shop after dinner were being discouraged. Sparrow also cited the example of NSW food regulations which had previously banned soft-boiled eggs from being served in nursing homes because of a small risk of listeria. \u201cIt had to be boiled in excess of 15 minutes,\u201d she said. \u201cOur view is that if you\u2019re 80 and made decisions all your life, and have fought in a world war and brought up a family, and you want to have a soft boiled egg then you should have a soft boiled egg. That should be a choice you should be able to make.\u201d Scott Morrison and his many coloured folders walks in with Josh Frydenberg We are in the chamber, so it\u2019s time for who\u2019s that MP? It\u2019s Pat Conroy Brendan O\u2019Connor was asked about Labor accepting asylum seekers and refugees may be treated on Christmas Island: It goes really to the question of medical requirements. And I would think that that decision has to be made by the minister, having listened to the advice of the medical experts. But I understand one of the reasons we transfer people to the mainland, and why the current government transfers people to the mainland of Australia, is that\u2019s where the medical expertise is.\u201d Earlier today, Bill Shorten had said this: If the medical treatment is delivered and delivered on Christmas Island and it makes people well, that\u2019s fine.\u201d The motion that Labor senators in the legal and constitutional affairs committee were trying to pass to force Michaelia Cash to front, has failed. The information regulator has just been up before estimates, and we\u2019ve heard yet more evidence of it struggling with increased demand and threadbare resources. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) plays a crucial role in ensuring the government does not wrongly refuse or unnecessarily delay freedom of information requests. In short, its job is to help keep the government be as transparent as possible. But the office has struggled since 2014, when it had its resources cut so significantly it was forced to shut down its Canberra office, with its information commissioner forced to work from home. Funding has increased gradually since, but the agency is still operating well below minimum staffing levels it said it needed when it was established, and only has a single statutory officer, rather than the three it originally had. Senate estimates heard on Tuesday that the pressure on the office has continued. It has experienced a 42% increase in requests to review FOI decisions in the past six months. Some cases are now taking as long as 11 months, up from eight months, to assign to an OAIC officer. The information commissioner, Angelene Falk, said pressure was also being felt in the agency\u2019s handling of privacy complaints.\u201d For instance, for privacy the allocation time was around seven and a half months, and that\u2019s moved to nine months. \u201cIn FOI, in October last year it was eight and a half months, it\u2019s moved to 11 months. So in terms of addressing that very real issue, we\u2019re working very proactively in terms of the cause of the increased matters, working to seek to ensure that there\u2019s good FOI decision-making happening in the first place. \u201cAt the same time we are looking at our internal processes. We are putting more focus and resources into our early resolution processes, that is bearing fruit.\u201d After questioning by crossbench senator Rex Patrick, Falk said the OAIC could use more resources. But she said it was too simplistic to only ask for more resources. Patrick had earlier clashed with assistant home affairs minister, Linda Reynolds, and chair, Ian Macdonald, after the crossbencher described the situation with the OAIC as a \u201cdisaster\u201d and urged Falk to tell the government she needed more resources. On Michaelia Cash and Michael Keenan, Scott Morrison had this to say this morning, when talking to Melbourne radio 3AW: Neil Mitchell: Well what about another case, a former minister and a minister Michael Keenan and Michaelia Cash refusing to cooperate with the police investigation. That\u2019s outrageous. Scott Morrison: That\u2019s not true. NM: Did they refuse to give an interview? SM: They were written to and they were asked to respond which they did and they provided responses and the police have not sought any further statement from them. So they have cooperated. NM: It\u2019s reported today they refused to give statements to federal police, is that right? SM: They provided a response and the police have accepted that response and they haven\u2019t sought any I\u2019m advised, any further statement. NM: So the police didn\u2019t want a statement, so they ... SM: Well I\u2019m just saying that (they) cooperated with the investigation and nothing\u2019s been sought from them. And remember what this is about. This is about the alleged \u2026 NM A political leak. SM: ... misuse of union funds by the AWU, Bill Shorten\u2019s union. There was a raid because the police believe they were destroying evidence that may have suggested that the Shorten\u2019s union was sending money, allegedly, to GetUp! and even to his own benefit. So that\u2019s what this is about. So Bill Shorten should cooperate and actually provide the minutes of meetings and the other things that are necessary for the police to do their investigation. I think he\u2019s the one with the questions to answer and obviously to be cooperating. NM: Well I thought everybody should cooperate. You would hope, that didn\u2019t happen here in Victoria. SM: They should, you\u2019re dead right Neil. People should cooperate with police investigations and my ministers have. Murray Watt and Brendan O\u2019Connor held a press conference to announce Labor would be demanding Michaelia Cash face the legal affairs estimates hearing: Yesterday, we had evidence from the AFP that the reason \u2013 that, in their view \u2013 a crime had been committed in this information being leaked from minister Cash\u2019s office. They recommended prosecution to the DPP. And the only reason that didn\u2019t occur was because there are about eight people, including minister Cash and minister Keenan, who refused to provide witness statements. Now, no other Australian has the luxury of turning down the police when they ask for a witness statement. But we\u2019ve got two senior cabinet ministers who thumb their nose at the justice system; who thumb their nose at the police and refuse to cooperate by giving a witness statement. Now, today that evidence has been backed up by the DPP. What we\u2019ve learned from the DPP today is that it was their opinion, on the evidence that the AFP forwarded to them, that there was a prima facie case that a crime had been committed, that it was in the public interest for a prosecution to occur. But the only reason it didn\u2019t happen was because they didn\u2019t have enough evidence, particularly because ministers and staffers had refused to give evidence and refused to provide witness statements. So, we\u2019ve got the DPP here. We had the AFP yesterday. The only person who\u2019s missing from this equation, who has any answers, is Michaelia Cash. Now, the time for Michaelia Cash to remain in hiding is over. Enough of the whiteboards, enough of claiming privilege, enough of claiming immunities, it\u2019s time that she actually did her job, came to Estimates, after the lunch break, and answered some questions that only she can answer. She has a lot of questions to answer and it\u2019s not fair for her to put it on her public servants to do her dirty work and have to answer questions for her. It\u2019s the downhill slide to question time. Hit me with your predictions. Given Labor\u2019s private members bills, I think you can expect the opposition to stick to the banking royal commission today. Mike Bowers had a busy morning Quick update on estimates Mathias Cormann is having a tough morning on the chair. Let me bring you a quick summary of the evidence he\u2019s given to date. Cormann has told the hearing he booked three private trips to Singapore by calling the CEO of Helloworld, Andrew Burnes, direct. Asked whether it is unusual to book travel by calling the CEO of a travel company on his mobile rather than calling a 1800 number, Cormann said: \u201cI have to say, I\u2019ve got close, personal relationships ... I\u2019ve got a close personal relationship with Mr Burnes and I don\u2019t think it is unusual to ask somebody who owns a business to sell products and services back to you on commercial terms\u201d. Cormann says he has no evidence the travel was provided to him at a discount. He says the travel was never intended to be free. His failure to pay the bill was an oversight. Just to give some quick background on Burnes \u2013 he\u2019s a Liberal party treasurer, and the company has made donations to the Liberal party. Cormann describes him as a friend he sees socially. The finance minister says he had no involvement in a decision to give Burnes\u2019 company a government travel contract, although he has given evidence that the CEO complained to him about the way the finance department was running the tender process. Cormann says he did not pass those complaints on to officials, and he told Burnes to take up his concerns with the bureaucrats. The secretary of the finance department, Rosemary Huxtable, says she fielded concerns from Burnes about the process leading to Helloworld being given the contract, but did not pass the concerns on to the procurement team because he didn\u2019t want to make a formal complaint. She says she didn\u2019t make notes of the conversation. Huxtable says the only time she\u2019s ever discussed the tender with Cormann was last night, when he sought particulars as part of answering questions from Fairfax Media. Cormann says he has no issue with a company, with close links to the Liberal party, being awarded a tender provided all the probity checks were carried out. He says companies able to provide services at competitive cost should not be excluded from bidding for government work because some of their personnel participate in the democratic process. \u201cYou are saying taxpayers of the commonwealth should have to pay more,\u201d he says. The finance minister also pointed out that Labor awarded a contract to Helloworld when it was last in office. Cormann says the latest contract extracted savings. Penny Wong editorialises that the whole arrangement looks \u201ccosy and comfortable\u201d. Cormann says the contract was \u201cmerit-based\u201d. The committee is taking a lunch break now. I\u2019ll keep you posted. In the Labor caucus, one MP noted the opposition had to consider 17 government bills last week and 25 bills this week and ventured the view \u201cit is impossible for all of these to be passed\u201d. The manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, responded that unless the government schedules additional sitting weeks there is \u201cabsolutely no prospect\u201d of those becoming law \u2013 after this week there are only three sitting days between now and August. In further on-record comments to reporters Burke said: \u201cThe concept of the government saying there are effectively more than 40 pieces of legislation that need to become law then in the same breath claiming we don\u2019t need extra sitting days doesn\u2019t add up.\u201d Burke said there was \u201cnothing normal\u201d about introducing this much legislation before an election and he \u201ccan\u2019t see any logic\u201d in what they\u2019re doing. Although some are uncontroversial, Burke suggested he would be \u201cstunned\u201d if as many 10 of the bills passed before the election (expected for May). Another highlight from caucus - shadow finance minister Jim Chalmers said Labor would \u201cexamine all options\u201d if the government signed a contract to privatise the visa processing system. That\u2019s sure to scare off potential bidders. Amnesty International Australia\u2019s Tim O\u2019Connor had a few things to say about the Border Force admission regarding its stuff up and how it related to Hakeem al-Araibi\u2019s detention: It is absolutely unacceptable that Hakeem, a completely innocent man supposedly under the Australian government\u2019s care, was detained for 76 days in Thailand in fear of his life simply because someone at Border Force \u2018forgot to send an email\u2019,\u201d he said in a statement. The Australian government must conduct an independent investigation into this monumental mistake that cost a young man and his family months of heartache and could have cost them much more had he been sent back to Bahrain. Our government must ensure that no other refugee is ever put in this situation again. The results of any investigation must be made public immediately, and systems put in place to ensure no other person will suffer as Hakeem and his family have. \u2018Human error\u2019 must never again result in someone\u2019s life being endangered. AAP has been listening to the agriculture estimates (thank you). This report comes with a reminder that Barry O\u2019Sullivan will be leaving the parliament once his Senate term is up this year, with the Queensland LNP having replaced his spot on the ticket with Susan McDonald. Queensland Nationals senator Barry O\u2019Sullivan says \u2018some bloody old Chinaman\u2019 is more risk to Australia\u2019s biosecurity than levy-paying importers. It was revealed at Senate estimates the agriculture department has received mostly negative feedback over the proposed biosecurity imports levy, which would tax containers brought into the country. \u2018There\u2019s a bigger chance of us having a biosecurity breach from some bloody old Chinaman that brings in his favourite sausage down the front of his undies,\u2019 Senator O\u2019Sullivan said at Tuesday\u2019s hearing. The new levy is due to start on 1 July and would be imposed on all cargo imported to Australia by sea, with the exception of military equipment. It would be imposed on stevedores, with the initial rate set at $10.02 per incoming twenty-foot equivalent sea container and $1 per tonne for cargo not in a container. Senator O\u2019Sullivan said millions of people travelling across Australian borders were a higher risk than importers. \u201cI\u2019m not opposed to a tax to raise money for biosecurity, but from those that pose a risk. So start with the Chinaman,\u201d he said. Scott Morrison targeted Labor\u2019s record on border protection in the Coalition party room (no surprise there) but the way he did it may raise eyebrows \u2013 apparently it\u2019s Labor politicising the issue: In relation to border protection the Labor party has always failed because they\u2019ve always looked at it through the political lens, and always focused purely on the politics of it. Whereas our position is authentic. We\u2019ve been consistent. They [asylum seekers] are not coming here as long as we are here.\u201d The government also confirmed that it is working on a recovery package for northern Queensland after the floods. Three MPs also raised farmers \u201cright to farm\u201d without interference from animal rights activists for example, using drones. Both Scott Morrison and Bill Shorten have made statements to the House recognising the 70th anniversary of Australia\u2019s formal diplomatic relationship with Israel. Labor\u2019s decision to release three private member\u2019s bills on banking reform is designed to step up pressure on Scott Morrison and the crossbench to recall parliament for extra weeks in March. Without some more crossbench support from the likes of Bob Katter and Andrew Wilkie Labor lacks numbers to suspend standing orders to introduce the bills or recall parliament. Bill Shorten: \u201cDoes the Parliament want to deal with banking scandals and rip-offs or not? Mr Morrison should explain to people what he finds objectionable in clamping down on dodgy funeral insurance? What does the Government find objectionable about clamping down and making sure that people aren\u2019t getting ripped off in car loans? What does he find objectionable, in particular, about giving ASIC the power to scrutinise insurance contracts and claims practices, especially as thousands of our fellow Australians in northern Queensland are just recovering from the dreadful rains and floods that they\u2019ve had there. So the onus is on him ... \u201cAnd that goes for the crossbench. Mr Katter has made a name of being sceptical about the bank\u2019s scandals and performance. A great record. But he needs to explain - we know that there will be problems with insurance records. We know that there will be problems for funeral insurance. We know that there will be problems with dodgy car loans. Why would we turn a blind eye and let it go for another six months?\u201d Helen Davidson explains the Nauru decision to ban international medical transfers, based on telehealth referrals: Under the health practitioners (overseas medical referrals compliance) regulations, all transfer referrals must now come from the Nauru hospital, through to the controversial overseas medical review panel, and be signed off by the minister. Nauru officials have previously been accused of blocking the transfer of sick refugees, even under order from Australia\u2019s federal court. The move affects not only Australia\u2019s medevac system but also Medecins Sans Frontieres. Earlier this month it launched a telehealth service so it could continue to treat its patients on the island. Guardian Australia understands the Nauruan government was informed of its launch but had not made any comment or responded to it, although perhaps this new law is their response. MSF had been providing mental health care to asylum seekers, refugees and local Nauruans on site for almost a year when it was abruptly kicked off the island by the Nauruan government. The government accused it of conspiring against them with activists. MSF said it had been treating extraordinarily high rates of extreme mental illness among its entire patient cohort, and feared for their welfare after the organisation left. While the new law does not outlaw the service, it prevents the MSF staff from referring patients to the review panel for an international transfer unless they send the patient through the Nauruan hospital. \u201cThis telehealth service is MSF\u2019s only remaining option to continue to act on our medical and ethical commitment to former patients,\u201d said Christine Rufener, a clinical psychologist and MSF mental health activity manager. The legislation itself, can be found here The bills Labor plan on introducing, as summarised by Bill Shorten\u2019s office include: TLA (enhancing consumer protection) Bill 2019 1. Recommendation 1.7 - Removing point of sale exemption This exemption allows salespeople to avoid consumer credit protections when they refer their customers to credit providers. Classic examples are car dealers or stores like Harvey Norman that refer customers to credit providers to get them to buy their products. By getting rid of this exemption, we\u2019re ensuring that car dealers and other salespeople have to comply with consumer credit laws that apply to credit assistance providers like brokers. 2. Recommendation 4.2 - Removing the exemptions for funeral expenses policies This exception allows dodgy companies like Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund (not an Aboriginal company) to sell low-value funeral expenses products without having to comply with the rules around insurance. They are basically unregulated. Removing the exemption will allow Asic to regulate these products and crack down on dodgy products. 3. Recommendation 4.8 \u2013 Removal of claims handling exemption Insurance is regulated as a financial service \u2013 from sales to policy exclusions to disclosure. What\u2019s not covered, despite being really important to customers, is claims handling. The whole claims handling process is exempt from Asic oversight and regulation. Removing this exemption will mean that insurance claims handling will be regulated. Corporations amendment (ending grandfathered commissions) bill 2019 4. Recommendation 2.4 - Grandfathered commissions We are implementing this recommendation sooner than the government proposes to. Commissioner Hayne said that it should be done \u201cas soon as is reasonably practicable\u201d and we are proposing to have it done by 1 January 2020. The government says they will do it by 1 January 2021. We are doing it a full year earlier. Corporations amendment (strengthening AFCA processes) bill 2019 5. Recommendation 4.11 - Co-operation with AFCA AFCA is the main place that consumers go to resolve disputes with banks. When a consumer goes to AFCA, they often know they have a problem \u2013 they might be behind on their mortgage or have lost money from their account - but the bank has all of the information. Banks don\u2019t have clear obligations to share information with AFCA about the issues that customers are complaining about. This bill will require financial services providers to share documents with AFCA that are relevant to the issues that a customer complains about. The bells have rung and the prayers said. The House of Representatives is sitting for one of the last times before the election (seriously, we have like, five or fewer sittings left on the current election call timetable). Bill Shorten on the Christmas Island decision and the Nauru government decision to potentially block transfers (we are still waiting to see what the actual outcome of that is): We\u2019ve got to maintain strong borders but also ensure humane treatment of people who are directly or indirectly in our care. That\u2019s a fundamental principle of the Australian way of life. What we\u2019ve done is codify existing practice. 900 people under this government have come to Australia. Somehow, this government thinks that for the 500 left, providing transparent codification of medical treatment is a factor. That\u2019s a complete lie by a government seeking to distract people from the failings of the government of Australia. If the medical treatment is delivered and delivered on Christmas Island and it makes people well, that\u2019s fine. The issue here is the safe treatment of people within the context of strong borders. On Nauru, and I haven\u2019t seen what the Nauruens have passed \u2013 they\u2019re a sovereign country. I\u2019ve always said that. If they\u2019re passing laws which they feel are necessary, they are to be respected for that, they are a sovereign government.\u201d So on the issue of mortgage brokers and \u201cuser pays\u201d \u2013 the recommendation which has the whole mortgage broker industry up in arms \u2013 Chris Bowen says this: The royal commission did identify issues in mortgage broking, real issues, which need to be addressed. Now, the government has said that they\u2019ll get rid of trail commissions and then have a review of upfront commissions but that doesn\u2019t really provide much certainty for the sector with a review going forward. We want to deal with the matters that the royal commission identified with mortgage brokers and the problems that they identified. Of course, we\u2019ve been taking our time to carefully consult with all relevant parties and we\u2019ll have more to say in the coming days about the approach. The approach will be fully transparent and explicit in our approach, not only well before the election, but in the immediate future.\u201d So that\u2019s a wait and see then. Chris Bowen on the private members bills Labor plans on introducing to the parliament, addressing the recommendations of the banking royal commission (well, some of them): The royal commission recommended that grandfathered commissions for planners be removed \u201cAs soon as practical\u201d. As soon as practical. The government\u2019s response says they\u2019ll get around to it on January 1, 2021. That\u2019s not as soon as practical. We believe it can be done on January 1, 2020, and it legislated now. Give people time to adjust. Give people, planners and the financial sector time to implement it. It\u2019s straightforward legislation which can be achieved now. It can be achieved a full 12 months in advance of what the government\u2019s proposed timetable is. That is not as soon as practical. The government is not achieving that recommendation. They say they\u2019re taking action on all recommendations well, they\u2019re taking more action on some than others. There\u2019s 14 that they\u2019re not implementing. This is one of them where they\u2019re falling short. We can do better. Secondly: In a royal commission full of disturbing evidence, some of the most harrowing was in relation to funeral insurance, which is exempt from protections under the Act, protections under the law at the moment. Particularly concerning was the conduct of some in relation to funeral insurance with our Indigenous community. No other word than shameful exploitation. That should not go on one day longer. The legislation we\u2019ll put in will go on royal ascent - in other words, immediately. There is no excuse for this kind of behaviour to carry on until August or later in the year. It should stop immediately. We\u2019re prepared to legislate it in coming days and for it to apply from royal ascent, from the time that the government can send it to the governor general for approval after it was approved by both houses of parliament, which could be done, with a bit of good will from the government. Now, these are two practical steps which we\u2019re getting on with. We\u2019ve taken our time to work through, based on thorough legal advice, what can be quickly implemented, keeping with the royal commission recommendations. We\u2019ve done that consultation, we\u2019ve done that work and we believe that these are elements that can be implemented immediately. There are other things we accept and I\u2019ve said from the outset, that are more complicated and will take more time and need more complicated drafting and consultation. But even the royal commission doesn\u2019t recommend it is done urgently. There are some in that category but others that we should be getting on with now.\u201d Kimberley Kitching: Is this the only discussion you have had with Mr Burnes relating to travel where he\u2019s also taken your travel booking? Mathias Cormann: I believe that I\u2019ve booked travel through Helloworld on three occasions and on each occasion, the payment, I\u2019ve verified, the payment was processed. Then Penny Wong got involved. PW: I think that Senator Kitching\u2019s question went to ... I mean, it is an unusual thing to call someone at his level to book flights. That says something about the relationship, Senator Cormann. But I think the question went to \u2013 how many times did you actually transact with, is it the CEO, of this large company, for the flights? MC: On three occasions. PW: So all of your personal travel, you ring him? MC: Well, in more recent times, that\u2019s right. And then Jenny McAllister picks up the questioning. JA: But not just through Helloworld, sorry. You don\u2019t just ring one of their employees, you ring the boss. Is that how it works? MC: Well, he was my contact that I knew at Helloworld and I made travel arrangements through him. Through his office. JA: That\u2019s an odd arrangement. MC: Well ... Labor: So how did it work? Did you say: I\u2019ve got the following dates available for travel? Or my family does? And he went through and found the flights for you? This is all on the phone? How did the conversation work? MC: The way that it would work is that I would ask for travel bookings to be made and for me to be invoiced and charged. You know, obviously I don\u2019t know what the arrangements are within his office. JA: Minister, it is a very unusual arrangement. Most Australians don\u2019t have a direct line to the CEO of a travel company to arrange their travel bookings. How did the arrangement come out between yourself and Mr Burnes? Did he offer to facilitate your travel? Or did you approach him about becoming your travel agent? MC: Well, Helloworld is a travel business. JA: They are. But they don\u2019t advertise the CEO\u2019s phone number, broadly, for general public use. So I\u2019m wondering about the circumstances that see you phoning the CEO of an organisation? MC: The circumstances that I organised to travel and I booked travel and I paid for it? Labor: How do you know Mr Burnes? MC: Well, I\u2019ve known him over the years. It\u2019s a matter of public record that he has been involved in the Liberal party for some time. Labor: So how far back does your association with him go? MC: I\u2019d have to take that on notice. I think ... From ... six or seven years, perhaps. Labor: But it\u2019s only in recent times that you\u2019ve commenced booking with him directly? MC: Well, the trips would have been in the last three or so years, yes. Labor: Right, so some time in the last three years, you moved away from whoever had previously been navigating your travel for you and you started phoning Mr Burnes directly? MC: I made travel bookings through Helloworld, that\u2019s right. Labor: And again I ask you, who initiated the arrangement? Where the CEO would be available to you, personally, to take your call, in relation to your family holiday bookings? MC: To be fair, in more recent times, I had more interaction with him in the context, obviously, of his involvement with the Liberal party and that is where the occasion arose where I was able to make those bookings. Labor: And did he offer to you, or did you ask him, to establish such an arrangement? MC: Well, I take responsibilities for having made the bookings if that is the question. JA: I\u2019m asking you more broadly about the arrangement. When you call him, do you call him on his mobile? MC: Um ... I think it varies. It varies. Labor: So you\u2019ve got all of his contact details? MC: Well, I run into him from time to time. Labor: Where did you meet? MC: Sorry? Labor: Where did you meet? Did you meet at a Liberal party function? Where did you meet? MC: I\u2019ve known him over the years. I mean, he\u2019s been involved ... I can\u2019t remember the first meeting. I honestly can\u2019t. Labor: So, there is a point, though, where somehow, between the two of you, it becomes ... Ordinary people ring Helloworld through a 1800 number, I suppose. I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t attempted to do it. But you ring the CEO on his personal mobile. I\u2019m trying to understand how you came to be in such a relationship with Mr Burnes, where it was possible for you to ring him on his personal mobile and he would write down your credit card details? MC: Well, as I\u2019ve said, I\u2019ve known him for a number of years, going all the way back to the opposition years and obviously, it\u2019s a matter of public record that he\u2019s been involved at senior levels in the Liberal party for some time, which, incidentally, didn\u2019t prevent his company from securing a contract through a merit-based proper tender process under the period of the previous Labor government. And then the answers take a turn, with Mathias Cormann admitting he has booked his trips through the Helloworld CEO and Liberal party treasurer, Andrew Burnes. Directly. Kimberley Kitching: With whom did you speak? Mathias Cormann: With Mr Burnes. KK: You spoke with Mr Burnes? He\u2019s the managing director? Isn\u2019t that correct? MC: Yes. KK: Of an ASX-listed travel company and made a booking? MC: I made arrangements there. KK: [He\u2019s the CEO of a company] and he took your travel booking? MC: I can only tell you what happened. I made the booking through Helloworld, engaging with Mr Burnes, that\u2019s right. And I provided my credit card details and I asked for payment to be made and I was assured that this would happen. Kimberley Kitching is leading the questioning of Mathias Cormann at the moment: KK: So, could I go to the details of the Fairfax story this morning? The overseas trip. Did you book the travel in July 2017? MC: Yes. KK: Did you personally book it? MC: Yes. KK:Your office didn\u2019t book it? MC: No. KK: So you, yourself, booked it? MC: I personally booked it. I personally supplied my credit card details. I personally gave the instruction for the flight booking to be charged to my credit card. I thought that that had happened, but you know, I know that the question is going to be asked \u2013 didn\u2019t you keep an eye on your credit card? I should have, is the truthful answer, but what I would offer by way of explanation, if not by way of an excuses that with the extensive travel that I do undertake on a weekly basis, there\u2019s a lot of travel-related expenditure that goes through my credit card and having made the booking, having given and having provided the credit card details and given the instruction for the payment to be deducted, I assumed that that had happened. The travel did not take place until sometime later and certainly, by the time that the ... that I undertook the travel, I was 100% confident that payment had been made. In fact, when the issue was first brought to my attention yesterday, I was 100% confident that payment had been made until I was confronted with some information which was sent to me from within an internal system of the Helloworld business which led me to, of course, in my understanding ... I hasten to adhere, and I\u2019ve addressed this in my statement. At no point did I receive any reminders of an outstanding payment required. So as far as I was concerned, I had provided my credit card details when the booking was made and I assumed that the payment had been processed and you know, my experience in general terms, if I have forgotten to pay something, I do get reminder notices. It does happen, it can happen from time to time when you\u2019re on the road a lot. But I did not receive any reminder notices over an extended period until such time that it was raised with me yesterday, and on verification, I ascertained the facts that I outlined in my statement and as soon as I became aware that the payment remained outstanding I made sure that the payment was processed immediately. There can\u2019t be any suggestions at all that this was ever intended to be free travel or that it was free travel. It wasn\u2019t. There was obviously a charge carried in the system and within the business against that travel, a charge that I assumed had been processed against my credit card, but it turns out that it hadn\u2019t. Mathias Cormann\u2019s travel is the latest subject in the finances estimates hearing. Bob Katter also received a \u201cPratt\u201d cap as a \u201cpresent from the prime minister this morning\u201d. He tells Tom Connell that he and \u201cPratty\u201d are cousins, in some way. Annnnnd as predicted, the Labor press conference will be on Labor\u2019s response to the banking royal commission, and the private members\u2019 bills to deal with it. Labor is planning three bills, at this stage. Bill Shorten is out of caucus and has called a doorstop for 11.30, with Chris Bowen and Clare O\u2019Neil, which means banking royal commission. Adam Bandt is not messing around \u2013 he wants it known he will vote yes in a no confidence motion and he wants it known far and wide. Again, there is no suggestion any one will be moving the motion, or that it would have the numbers to pass. Transferring sick people to Christmas Island is directly defying the will of the Parliament. \u201cThis government is a threat to decency and democracy. \u201cThese conservatives are so bereft of humanity and respect for the rule of law that they have lost the right to govern. \u201cI will support a \u2018no confidence\u2019 motion. I\u2019ll vote for it any time this week. This mob needs to be turfed out as quickly as possible.\u201d #capgate Kerryn Phelps is also angry over the decision. She tweeted this last night: Adam Bandt says he will support a \u201cno-confidence\u201d motion against the government, over the Christmas Island decision. In a tweet, the Greens MP says: The gov is now defying the will of the Parliament. The conservatives are so bereft of humanity and respect for the rule of law that they have lost the right to govern. I will support any \u2018no confidence\u2019 motion moved against this train wreck of a govt.\u201d As far as I know, no one is planning on moving a no-confidence motion. And even if every other crossbencher supported it (and there is no suggestion they would), Bob Katter would not go for this and you need 76. It\u2019s been quiet because all the parties are meeting. We\u2019ll bring you what was was discussed in there as soon as we can. Speaking of valedictories \u2013 Kelly O\u2019Dwyer will be delivering hers tomorrow as well. This also happened overnight. Second Monday feels coming in strong for the finance minister. A fire alarm appears to be going off in the room where Mathias Cormann is facing his estimates grilling. Yesterday the lights went off in the House of Representatives chamber. Things are fine. There has been a lot of attention on Adani, but plans to drill in the Great Australian Bight are also moving ahead. Sarah Hanson-Young says she\u2019ll fight the decision: We cannot let this project go ahead. Equinor wants approval within months. The Greens are standing with South Australians to fight this all the way. We are not prepared to let South Australian tourism and fishing industries be put at risk for the sake of multinational corporate profits, no matter what spin Equinor tries to put on it. The reality is the bight is too precious to risk. Drilling for oil in the middle of a whale sanctuary is madness. The bight waters are rough and remote. Equnior has nothing to lose and everything to gain from this project. In the case of an oil spill, it will be South Australians, not Equinor, who pay the price. At a time when we know we must transition away from fossil fuels to arrest climate change, the costs of opening up a new oilfield to the planet are too great. Instead of opening up another oilfield, Australia should be showing the world how great the bight is. It is home to some of the most unique wildlife in the world \u2013 85% of marine life found in the bight is found nowhere else. The Greens are pursuing world heritage protection for the bight, supporting our jobs in tourism and fisheries, and our beautiful Kangaroo Island over big oil. Labor and the Liberals want to risk all we love about the bight to do the bidding of the oil and gas industry. The 73% of South Australians who want world heritage protection for the Great Australian Bight can have faith that the Greens are fighting with them to protect the bight and stop this project. Scott Morrison had a few things to say to Neil Mitchell about his future as well. Asked if he is confident of being re-elected: \u201cOf course, I mean, I didn\u2019t take the job on to, you know, do anything else but that. I took the job because I believed it was essential that the Liberal and National parties were returned this next election, because the Labor party will change it all,\u201d he said. If re-elected, can he guarantee he\u2019ll remain as prime minister for the whole term? \u201cYes, because our party resolved that last year. An elected Liberal prime minister will now have the security of that arrangement over the next term. That is what we decided last year.\u201d Would he be opposition leader if not re-elected? \u201cI am not contemplating that situation, I am contemplating being re-elected, ensuring that we can continue keeping Australia safe, secure our borders and keep our economy strong.\u201d Mitchell laughs at this and tells Morrison \u201cwell, they are both hypothetical\u201d. There\u2019s a beat of silence. \u201cNot in my mind,\u201d Morrison says. \u201cI am dealing with the reality. You know me, Neil. I leave nothing on the field.\u201d Asked what emoji he\u2019d put on his number plate (don\u2019t ask, it\u2019s a Queensland thing), Morrison says: \u201cA big smiley face. A big smiley face. You know me, I\u2019m that cheery.\u201d Amy has already brought you news of Mathias Cormann\u2019s travel travails this morning, and posted his statement about the Singapore trip. The finance minister has also tabled a statement from the travel company which characterises the non-payment as a \u201cregrettable\u201d administrative error. The letter from the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Michael Burnett, says the company had been instructed by Cormann to hold credit card details so the payment could be processed in July 2017. \u201cBecause we held your credit cards at the time of booking, payment reminders were not sent to you, even though the amount remained listed as outstanding on our internal system,\u201d Burnett says. \u201cWe have no processed payment of the full outstanding amount of $2,780.82 from the credit card previously supplied to us. The flights were never free and they were never intended to be free. \u201cWe apologise for any inconvenience or embarrassment this administrative error may have caused.\u201d Helloworld is the recipient of a government travel contract. Cormann said in a statement his morning he had \u201cabsolutely no involvement in either the selection of the preferred tenderer or the awarding of the contract\u201d. On Border Force\u2019s role in Hakeem al-Araibi\u2019s detention in Thailand, Scott Morrison has told Melbourne radio 3AW he believes it is a little unfair to suggest that the stuff-up was solely to blame for what happened: There are many other ways that Hakeem may have been kept in Thailand, other than just that incident. But I am not suggesting that that incident is not something that needs to be addressed, but it would be wrong to assume that other than for that, that wouldn\u2019t have occurred. The valedictories keep coming. Really brings home how few sitting days there are left until the election is called. Neil Mitchell had the pleasure of the prime minister\u2019s company on the airwaves this morning. He asked Scott Morrison about the cyber attack on the parliament and the major political parties. What\u2019s a state actor? \u201cIt means it is a government, but we are not in any position to be able to attribute that to any particular nation.\u201d We don\u2019t know who did it? \u201cWe are not in a position to ... what I am saying is you don\u2019t go and make those claims wildly ... we don\u2019t have any information, I don\u2019t have any information which would enable me to make that claim.\u201d So you don\u2019t know who did it. \u201cWell, I have said what I\u2019ve said. That\u2019s very specific wording I have used.\u201d Does he have suspicions? \u201cIt is not up to me to have suspicions and share them. It is up to me to speak to the facts as we know them and what we can be very confident of.\u201d Can he give a list of suspects? \u201cNo.\u201d Last night the Border Force commissioner, Michael Outram, admitted it was human error \u201cin the ABF process\u201d that contributed to Hakeem al-Araibi being detained for almost three months in Thailand. But he wouldn\u2019t apologise. Nick McKim: Mr Outram, I want to finish here. I\u2019m not going to dispute that Bahrain may have reached out directly to Thailand in a hypothetical alternative reality, but you\u2019d have to concede, wouldn\u2019t you, that the mistake made in ABF actually did directly result in the Australian federal police contacting Thai authorities and informing them that a red notice existed in relation to Mr Al-Araibi, and that that would not have occurred if that mistake had not been made? Outram: I accept that. McKim: You accept that. You sure you don\u2019t want to offer an apology Mr Al-Araibi. Outram: I apologise for the error that occurred within the ABF, but I can\u2019t say, nor can I accept, that that error necessarily led to his detention in Thailand, that it wouldn\u2019t have occurred anyway. That\u2019s the point I\u2019m making. This morning, Peter Dutton agreed it was a \u201cmistake\u201d: The officers dropped the ball on this, but that\u2019s a human error that\u2019s been made and let\u2019s put all of the hype aside. That\u2019s what\u2019s happened here. There\u2019s no conspiracy that somebody being denied information. It is a mistake that was made by an officer within Border Force and I think the commissioners Outram and [AFP commissioner Andrew] Colvin have dealt with it appropriately. I have just been reminded of this story Ben Doherty wrote last May in regards to the US-Australia refugee deal: Donald Trump\u2019s Muslim travel ban is influencing Australia\u2019s offshore processing system \u2013 with all Iranian and Somali refugees rejected for resettlement in the US. The third version of Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban bars or limits entry to citizens of five Muslim-majority countries \u2013 Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen \u2013 as well as North Korea ... About 150 refugees held in offshore processing on the island of Nauru have appointments with US officials this week, where they will discover final assessments of whether they have been accepted by America. So far, every Iranian and Somali applicant has been rejected. Which gives some insight into the 265 people rejected under the US\u2019s \u201cextreme vetting\u201d. And just another reminder that you can not have a serious criminal history and also be found to be a refugee. And it is not just the UNHCR who have assessed asylum seekers, it is our own agencies. You may have seen yesterday that the Australian Electoral Commission found that GetUp was not an associated entity. Alex Hawke responded late yesterday: The Morrison government has already succeeded in this parliament in passing laws to cover the activities of all political actors by banning undue foreign interference in Australian elections. This includes a tough new disclosure regime, which applies to political campaigners like GetUp, and began on 1 January. If political campaigners like GetUp want to act like a political party, they will be treated like one under the new regime. I can confirm that the Morrison government\u2019s new laws mean that GetUp now has the same disclosure obligations as political parties and associated entities. That means, just like a political party, GetUp must now disclose the source, amount and nature of funds received. By bringing all political actors in line with the same requirements political parties face, the Morrison government believes transparency in our political system will be increased. I also note GetUp\u2019s claims of independence. There is a substantial body of material showing GetUp acting in the direct interest of Labor and the Greens. Eighty-seven per cent of GetUp\u2019s past and present directors have a connection to Labor, the Greens, the trade union movement or leftwing organisations. GetUp\u2019s political activity is fundamentally aimed at campaigning against Coalition MPs and candidates exclusively. No one should be fooled by false claims of independence. The community rightfully expects transparency in the funding arrangements of any organisation that seeks to influence Australian elections. The Morrison government\u2019s new laws empower the AEC to hold political organisations to account more strongly than ever before. The government has accepted the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (JSCEM) and GetUp\u2019s new obligations under the Morrison government\u2019s legislation tackle the significant issues raised at the time of GetUp\u2019s referral to the AEC. Mathias Cormann has issued a statement following the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age story: In relation to the matters raised in the media today about my private travel in January 2018, I refer to the attached letter from Helloworld, which explains their administrative error. I can also confirm that the travel booked through Helloworld back in July 2017 was on commercial terms and should have been charged to my credit card straight away as instructed by me at the time. That is what I genuinely thought had happened. At no point, until approached by the media yesterday, did I receive any reminders that the payment due remained outstanding, even though I now understand it appeared as outstanding and unresolved on the internal Helloworld system since that time. The payment was processed immediately once it became apparent to me that it remained outstanding. In relation to the Whole of Government Accommodation Program Management Services tender I can confirm that I had absolutely no involvement in either the selection of the preferred tenderer or the awarding of the contract. When notified of the outcome of the tender, I was advised that the new contract was valued at $21 million for the initial term to 30 June 2020 (and not $1 billion as reported today). AOT was first selected as the successful supplier of whole of government Accommodation Program Management Services in May 2012 \u2013 during the period of the previous Labor Government. No doubt the tender process awarding this contract to AOT back in 2012 was conducted appropriately at arms-length from the government of the day, in the same way as it was on this occasion. Over the five years of that initial agreement from 2012 to 2017, my advice is that this arrangement saved the Commonwealth an estimated $63m. The subsequent tender process, also conducted at arms-length from government by the Department of Finance, further improved on those previous arrangements, delivering even better value for the commonwealth, by securing a reduction in APM booking fees of 42%, saving approximately $4.5m annually compared to the fees paid in 2015-16. This tender process was conducted consistent with all of the appropriate probity protocols, including oversight by external probity and legal advisers, who I\u2019m advised certified that the process complied with the requirements in the PGPA Act, the commonwealth procurement rules, commonwealth policies and was consistent with the probity plan, Request for Tender and Evaluation Plan. At no point did I influence or seek to influence the outcome of that tender process. I had absolutely no role in the awarding of this tender or during the subsequent contract negotiations with the preferred tenderer. I was provided with some feedback by the preferred tenderer about aspects of the process. Consistent with my standard practice, I refer anyone who raises issues with me in relation to these types of processes directly to the department for their consideration of any issues if and as appropriate at arms-length from me. That\u2019s what happened on this occasion. We got some actual facts and figures from the home affairs estimates hearing last night. There are 431 people on Nauru. Of that, 330 have been found to be refugees. Just 26 have had their refugee claim rejected. The remaining 75 are waiting to have their claims determined. There are 584 men on Manus Island. 456 have been found to be refugees 121 have been found to be non-refugees Seven have been given protection because of the serious risk to safety they face in their home countries. In the last five years, 1,246 people have been flown to Australia for medical treatment. 282 of those people have returned to either Manus or Nauru. Many of those who remain in treatment have launched legal action against their return. Peter Dutton told Sky News the United States has rejected 265 refugees as part of its \u201cextreme vetting process\u201d. Which is in keeping with what Malcolm Turnbull told Donald Trump in January 2017. Turnbull: The obligation is for the United States to look and examine and take up to and only if they so choose \u2013 1,250 to 2,000. Every individual is subject to your vetting. You can decide to take them or to not take them after vetting. You can decide to take 1,000 or 100. It is entirely up to you. The obligation is to only go through the process. So that is the first thing. Secondly, the people \u2013 none of these people are from the conflict zone. They are basically economic refugees from Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan. That is the vast bulk of them. They have been under our supervision for over three years now and we know exactly everything about them. Trump: Why haven\u2019t you let them out? Why have you not let them into your society? Turnbull: OK, I will explain why. It is not because they are bad people. It is because in order to stop people smugglers, we had to deprive them of the product. So we said if you try to come to Australia by boat, even if we think you are the best person in the world, even if you are a Nobel prize-winning genius, we will not let you in. That was an eventful evening. Australian Border Force admitted human error and an outdated IT system likely led to Hakeem al-Araibi spending just under three months in a Thai prison. That came after the Australian federal police pointed the finger at the Border Force agency, after sitting silent while Al-Araibi\u2019s allies worked to free him. Then there were all the Paladin questions, with many more answers still to come there. All of the estimates fun is back again today \u2013 you can find the schedule here. This morning though, it is all about the flights Mathias Cormann forgot to pay for. As you do. The Sydney Morning Herald and the Age\u2019s Nick McKenzie and Richard Baker reported the finance minister had \u201cno idea\u201d $2780.82 in flights were paid for by a travel company, until contacted by the reporters yesterday afternoon. From the McKenzie and Baker report: Finance minister Mathias Cormann\u2019s flights for a family holiday to Singapore were paid for by a travel company controlled by Liberal party treasurer Andrew Burnes within weeks of that company winning a $1bn contract from Cormann\u2019s department. ... Records kept by Helloworld and obtained by the Age and Sydney Morning Herald reveal that the Melbourne-based travel company paid $2780.82 for the Singapore flights, which were booked in July 2017. Senator Cormann said on Monday he had \u201cno idea\u201d that the travel had been booked on the family and staff travel account, nor that his credit card had not been charged. He was \u201ccompletely unaware of internal administrative arrangements at Helloworld in terms of how they managed private and personal travel\u201d. Expect Cormann to be asked more about that today. And of course, the border wars continue. Now the government is using the asylum seekers the US had rejected as part of its \u201cextreme vetting\u201d in its arguments. Sigh. Mike Bowers and the Guardian\u2019s brains trust are poised to tackle the day, including Katharine Murphy and Paul Karp in Canberra. I am still hunting for a coffee. It\u2019s been that kind of morning. Still, we persist. Ready, let\u2019s get into it.",

She admits that in the past \u2013 she was head of two schools in the north-east before moving to London \u2013 she has faced \u201cpersonal dilemmas\u201d over issues such as the use of GCSE-equivalent qualifications that were promoted intensively to boost some schools\u2019 league table positions. \u201cIt is really hard for people who are under pressure all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cToo many headteachers have found themselves compromised. The accountability measures say they have to achieve one thing and the local authority or academy trust says you have to do it quickly, therefore decision-making becomes harder and people take what they may view as shortcuts. \u201cIt is perfectly reasonable to make sure that a child gets a good set of examination results. But we can\u2019t get away from the fact that schools are communities that ought to model what we value about society. What we are hearing is that headteachers want a language they can use to support them in that long-term nuanced work.\u201d In an age where \u201crobust\u201d leadership and easily measured outcomes are highly valued, the commission could be accused of promoting a more \u201cwishy-washy\u201d definition of education. Michael Gove, the former education secretary, whose reforms still shape the lives of many schools, pioneered the idea of a slimmed-down inspection framework devoid of what he described as \u201cperipherals\u201d such as pupil wellbeing and community cohesion. His colleague Nick Gibb, who once described the idea of social and emotional learning as \u201cghastly\u201d, remains as schools minister. But the Ethical Leadership Commission has high-level support from the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), which helped to set it up, the National Association of Head Teachers, the Church of England Education Office, the Headmasters and Headmistresses\u2019 Conference, the Chartered College of Teaching and the National Governors\u2019 Association. At the publication of its final report last month, it received a warm welcome from the interim National Schools Commissioner, Dominic Herrington. Geoff Barton, general secretary of ASCL and a former headteacher, is adamant that the current system is not unethical. \u201cThe vast majority of practice upholds the values articulated in this framework,\u201d he says. \u201cOur members felt it was time to identify and articulate the principles and values that are immutable in education leadership, and provide a supportive framework upon which school leaders can draw in making difficult decisions under great pressure.\u201d A hundred schools are now trialling the framework and an ethics forum will meet several times a year to consider the sort of dilemmas leaders face, in the context of the Nolan principles \u2013 seven principles of public life: selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership \u2013 to which the commission has added the personal characteristics of trust, wisdom, kindness, justice, service, courage and optimism. The chief inspector of schools, Amanda Spielman, is a member of the commission and Roberts believes proposed changes to the Ofsted framework \u2013 away from focusing on results and towards a broader definition of \u201cquality of education\u201d \u2013 reinforce the idea that change is coming. Far from being abstract, she argues, the commission\u2019s \u201cvirtues and values\u201d are intricately bound up in real-life dilemmas faced by heads, and marshalling them into a framework can give colleagues confidence and courage. \u201cFor example, it is about going down the road and looking a colleague in the eye and saying: \u2018the way you do admissions or exclusions affects my school, and can we talk about this?\u2019 That is quite a difficult thing to do, so courage is very important. \u201cIt is about heads feeling they can be honest with parents if there is a disappointing set of GCSE results. It is about ensuring that children see adults treating each other in a just, wise and kind way, modelling the sort of behaviour we would want to see in society,\u201d says Roberts. She adds: \u201cIt is about supporting heads who want to take time to see both sides of the argument before making a reasoned judgment, or those who would prefer to support and be kind to a teacher who is under pressure in the hope of helping them through a difficult patch, rather than feeling that they are compromised because people expect them to be instant judges and zero-tolerant of failure.\u201d Even the current debate about mobile phone use in school has an ethical dimension, she says, and should be seen in the broader context of how society and adults use electronic devices. Most urgently, though, she argues that the framework is needed because England is facing a chronic teacher recruitment and retention crisis and headteachers in their 50s are leaving the profession in record numbers, partly because of competitive pressures and leadership styles that were valued in the past. Wilshaw notoriously suggested that heads would know they were doing their job properly if \u201cstaff morale was at an all-time low\u201d. \u201cThis had led to intolerable workload issues and it has made it harder for teachers to see themselves doing the job for 40 years,\u201d says Roberts. \u201cWe are losing experience and wisdom from the system. But every interaction in school ought to build up a stable and happy community in which all children are valued and adults want to work. We need a clear idea of what schools are for and we need to take seriously our responsibility to the sorts of citizens we want for the future.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The federal government has upgraded the threatened status of a flying fox after almost a third of its population was wiped out in Queensland\u2019s recent heatwave. The environment minister, Melissa Price, said the spectacled flying fox would be listed nationally as endangered, up from vulnerable, to \u201creflect heightened concerns for its future\u201d. It is estimated more than 20,000 flying foxes died in extreme heat in Queensland late last year. Humane Society International nominated the species for an endangered listing and the decision is one of five the group said had been delayed with the minister. Price also announced on Monday that the five vacancies on the government\u2019s threatened species scientific committee have been filled. She said the government had reappointed the chair of the committee, Prof Helene Marsh, along with fellow committee members David Keith and Dave Kendal. \u201cI have strengthened the committee\u2019s ability to provide advice that draws on Indigenous knowledge and helps land managers to care for their country by appointing Ms Cissy Gore-Birch, a Jaru/Kija woman from Western Australia, and Dr Richard Harper from the School of Veterinary and Life Sciences at Murdoch University,\u201d Price said. The announcements come after Guardian Australia published concerns from environment groups who described the minister as \u201cinvisible\u201d during a summer of natural disasters and accused her delaying decisions in her portfolio and not meeting with key groups. On Monday the minister also confirmed the bramble cay melomys, a small rodent that hasn\u2019t been since since 2009, would be formally declared extinct under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Humane Society International (HSI) said decisions on three woodlands, recommended for either listings as either critically endangered or endangered ecological communities by the scientific committee, had again been delayed by the minister, this time until June. Two of the woodlands were first recommended for a critically endangered listing in 2017, when Josh Frydenberg was the minister, and have been repeatedly delayed since then. \u201cAfter 18 months of pointless delays by her predecessor Josh Frydenberg, Minister Price has finally given spectacled flying-foxes the endangered listing they have been in desperate need of,\u201d said HSI\u2019s head of programs, Evan Quartermain. \u201cIt may have been overdue by several weeks, but we commend the minister for breaking the pattern of delay the first time the decision was hers to make and look forward to increased prioritisation of recovery actions to turn the species\u2019 trajectory towards extinction around.\u201d But he said the decision to defer the listings for the woodlands \u201ctempers the positive action for spectacled flying-foxes considerably\u201d. \u201cCritically endangered forests vital to the survival of orange-bellied parrots and endangered habitat for koalas will now continue to be destroyed while landholder opportunities for recovery funding go begging,\u201d he said.",

The distinction would work well for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/27/tana-french-interview\" title=\"\">Tana French</a>\u2019s acclaimed series of novels featuring the fictional Dublin murder squad (soon to be a TV series, scripted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/13/sarah-phelps-writing-eastenders-sex-scenes-agatha-christie-adaptation-interview\" title=\"\">Sarah Phelps</a>). It\u2019s a source of bafflement to me that French has not yet been nominated for a major literary award, and I can\u2019t help feeling that she almost certainly would have been if her characters weren\u2019t detectives. Her writing is poetic and scalpel-sharp, rich in allusions to literature, myth, history and contemporary politics; her exploration of character is full of insight. But there are murders to be solved, so her books \u2013 though garlanded with critical acclaim on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 have tended to be labelled as genre fiction.</p> <p>French\u2019s first standalone novel, <em>The Wych Elm</em>, might change that. Leaving the murder squad behind, she flips the perspective of a police procedural to regard the process from the other side, through a narrator who is, at various points, potential victim, suspect and witness. In the process, she carries out a forensic, and timely, examination of the nature of privilege and empathy.</p> <p>Toby Hennessy is in his late 20s, good-looking, with a beautiful girlfriend and a job in art PR. His charmed life is built on the solid foundation of an affluent, middle-class Dublin family and an expensive education. Toby is so shaped by advantages that he barely notices; in the opening sentence he describes himself as \u201cbasically, a lucky person\u201d. Then his luck runs out. During a break-in at his flat, he is beaten and left for dead. A head injury leaves him physically and mentally impaired.

      "bodyText": "The screenwriter Steven Moffat once said that his hit show Sherlock was \u201cnot a crime drama, but a drama about a man who solves crimes\u201d. The distinction would work well for Tana French\u2019s acclaimed series of novels featuring the fictional Dublin murder squad (soon to be a TV series, scripted by Sarah Phelps). It\u2019s a source of bafflement to me that French has not yet been nominated for a major literary award, and I can\u2019t help feeling that she almost certainly would have been if her characters weren\u2019t detectives. Her writing is poetic and scalpel-sharp, rich in allusions to literature, myth, history and contemporary politics; her exploration of character is full of insight. But there are murders to be solved, so her books \u2013 though garlanded with critical acclaim on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 have tended to be labelled as genre fiction. French\u2019s first standalone novel, The Wych Elm, might change that. Leaving the murder squad behind, she flips the perspective of a police procedural to regard the process from the other side, through a narrator who is, at various points, potential victim, suspect and witness. In the process, she carries out a forensic, and timely, examination of the nature of privilege and empathy. Toby Hennessy is in his late 20s, good-looking, with a beautiful girlfriend and a job in art PR. His charmed life is built on the solid foundation of an affluent, middle-class Dublin family and an expensive education. Toby is so shaped by advantages that he barely notices; in the opening sentence he describes himself as \u201cbasically, a lucky person\u201d. Then his luck runs out. During a break-in at his flat, he is beaten and left for dead. A head injury leaves him physically and mentally impaired. He recovers enough to function, but his memory is patchy, and his sense of himself and his place in the world has shattered; he has pitched from alpha male to object of pity. You\u2019d think this would be inciting incident enough for a novel, but there are more bombshells in store for Toby: his beloved Uncle Hugo has inoperable brain cancer. Since Toby is not fit for work, it is decided by his extended family that he should help Hugo by moving into the grand old family home where he and his cousins spent childhood summers and where Hugo now lives alone: \u201cThe Ivy House, twilight hide-and-seek among the moths and the silver birches, wild-strawberry picnics and gingerbread Christmases, endless teenage parties with everyone lying on the grass gazing up at the stars\u2026\u201d For a few weeks Toby, his girlfriend, Melissa, and Hugo settle into a peaceful, self-contained routine, until this, too, is upended by the discovery of a skull in the old wych elm in the garden, and a decade-old secret is thrust into the light. The biggest problem for Toby is that his injury makes him an unreliable narrator, even to himself. He no longer knows whether he can trust his memories of the events of that summer 10 years earlier, and he is no more certain of the version told him by his cousins Leon and Susanna.

Top stories On and on and on it goes \u2026 Theresa May appealed (again) to the Commons for more time to seek substantive changes from the EU27 to the Northern Ireland backstop, which pretty much all concerned know she is not going to get. She then lost control of her party (again), suffering an embarrassing Commons defeat by 303 votes to 258 as the hardline Eurosceptics of the European Research Group abstained on a government motion because it appeared to rule out a no-deal Brexit. The loss only strengthened Brussels\u2019 belief that the prime minister will never be able to forge a consensus in her warring party; its chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told EU diplomats her strategy had \u201cfailed\u201d and she must now work cross-party to build support for the withdrawal agreement. The European council president, Donald Tusk, meanwhile, said the bloc was still waiting for \u201crealistic\u201d proposals from the British government, and an EU source said the UK was merely \u201cpretending to negotiate\u201d. There are no signs from inside the Conservative party that the Brexit hatchet is about to be buried. May wrote to her MPs urging them to unite. But the leading pro-European MP Dominic Grieve said a dozen ministers could resign in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

They will sit as a new independent group. In the good news (not) department, Honda is to close its Swindon factory; more than 40 former ambassadors and high commissioners wrote to the prime minister warning her Brexit had turned into a \u201cnational crisis\u201d; business leaders demanded answers to 20 crucial questions on trade; a bank of England rate-setter said Brexit was already costing the economy \u00a340bn a year and low-cost airline Flybmi collapsed, blaming Brexit uncertainty.

      "body": "<p>Years ago I taught a young girl who had been diagnosed with muscular dystrophy. At the age of 15, she knew that in her adult life she would be a wheelchair user. Yet, she continued working towards her dream of becoming a scriptwriter, a dream tough enough to achieve when growing up in one of the poorest parts of the country, even harder when faced with such physical limitations. Joyfully, that student, <a href=\"https://www.londoncalling.com/features/an-interview-with-playwright-matilda-ibini\" title=\"\">Matilda Ibini</a>, has gone from strength to strength and I now follow on social media her career as an award-winning playwright.</p> <p>Contrast such grit and determination with the latest vision of \u201ccharacter\u201d to come from the education secretary, Damian Hinds.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/education-secretary-sets-out-five-foundations-to-build-character\" title=\"\">speech</a> to church school leaders, Hinds said children\u2019s \u201ccharacter and resilience\u201d are vitally important. Such platitudes are dull from a politician who should be tackling much bigger issues, such as school <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/sep/25/headteachers-petition-downing-street-budget-cuts\" title=\"\">underfunding</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/oct/02/never-return-teach-england-refuge-abroad\" title=\"\">teacher shortage</a>, but they are not a crime. Everyone knows character is important, so it\u2019s fair to emphasise it.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Hinds didn\u2019t stop there.

      "bodyText": "Years ago I taught a young girl who had been diagnosed with muscular dystrophy. At the age of 15, she knew that in her adult life she would be a wheelchair user. Yet, she continued working towards her dream of becoming a scriptwriter, a dream tough enough to achieve when growing up in one of the poorest parts of the country, even harder when faced with such physical limitations. Joyfully, that student, Matilda Ibini, has gone from strength to strength and I now follow on social media her career as an award-winning playwright. Contrast such grit and determination with the latest vision of \u201ccharacter\u201d to come from the education secretary, Damian Hinds. In a speech to church school leaders, Hinds said children\u2019s \u201ccharacter and resilience\u201d are vitally important. Such platitudes are dull from a politician who should be tackling much bigger issues, such as school underfunding and the teacher shortage, but they are not a crime. Everyone knows character is important, so it\u2019s fair to emphasise it. Unfortunately, Hinds didn\u2019t stop there. In classic Conservative fashion, he equated \u201ccharacter\u201d with \u201cpublic school confidence\u201d. I don\u2019t know what he thinks the phrase means, not least because Hinds didn\u2019t even attend an independent school, but for much of the population it conjures up a swaggering sense of entitlement that can sweep aside other people. Is that really want he wants to instil? Hinds went on to list the five foundations that he has decided will bestow this braying character on children across the land and \u2013 quelle surprise \u2013 they look exactly like the sort of thing you\u2019d see in a prospectus for Eton. Sport is on the list, obviously, along with so-called purposeful activities such as \u201crock climbing, hiking, orienteering, gym programmes, yoga \u2026 \u201d. Next up are \u201ccreative\u201d activities (such as art) and \u201cperforming\u201d (sing in a choir), plus volunteering and work experience as the fourth and fifth foundations. Look closely at that list. Breathe in its middle-class suppositions. And then answer these questions. How is yoga more purposeful than, say, playing computer games? Isn\u2019t creating YouTube videos a form of art? And is being responsible for picking up five siblings from school and getting their dinner ready, as some children do, a form of volunteering that would build character, or does it only count if you\u2019re wearing a Scout uniform? Umpteen factors can help children to develop character and resilience, which makes the list redundant. Furthermore, children today often develop their resilience in circumstances Hinds ought to be trying to change. Right now, for example, across the country there are more than 100,000 children living in temporary accommodation. That\u2019s three times more than in 2010 and directly related to the punitive welfare system brought in by Hinds\u2019 Conservative party. The level of uncertainty those children have to cope with, the sheer difficulty of staying organised enough to keep up with schoolwork while moving from place to place, mean most young people in this position develop more resilience in their little finger than some rugby-playing, yoga-taking politicians have in their entire anatomy. Will this level of grit be recognised in Hinds\u2019s plan to benchmark schools against his new public-school-character-activities ticklist? Of course not.

But sometimes I no longer recognise it</a>.\u201d There had long been rumours that dozens of Labour MPs were likely to quit but in the end the number was smaller, as some wanted to see Umunna and Berger test the water with donors, supporters and MPs from other parties. Even among those with no plans to quit, a string of Labour MPs from Yvette Cooper to Lisa Nandy have publicly made clear that they want to see change from the Labour leadership. Meanwhile there has been strong speculation that several centrist Conservative politicians are considering their future under Theresa May because of her policy towards the EU. Umunna has worked closely with Tories including Anna Soubry, the MP for Broxtowe, Heidi Allen, the MP for South Cambridgeshire, and Sarah Wollaston, the MP for Totnes, on the push for a second Brexit referendum.</p> \n<p>Of the seven who quit on Monday, Angela Smith has the slimmest electoral majority in her constituency of Penistone and Stocksbridge. At the Legion club in Penistone, opinion appeared split. \u201cI just can\u2019t vote for Angela Smith,\u201d said Mick Drewry, 66, accusing her of undermining Corbyn.

It was known he would leave upon the new attorney general, William Barr, taking office to replace Jeff Sessions. But the timing of the news lines up with Rosenstein\u2019s appearance in the news in recent days, over claims that he sounded out cabinet members about using their constitutional power to dismiss Trump from the presidency. Within the last day Trump has attacked Rosenstein, accusing him of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/18/donald-trump-andrew-mccabe-cbs-interview-russia-comey\">\u201cplanning a very illegal act\u201d</a>.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Rule out no deal, May told \u2013 </strong>Ministers have demanded that Theresa May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/18/ministers-tell-may-stop-using-no-deal-threat-as-negotiating-tactic\">stop using a no-deal Brexit as a negotiating tactic</a> because of the damage being done to British business.

It has been described as a \u201cshattering body blow\u201d for British manufacturing. Four ministers \u2013 David Gauke, Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Mundell \u2013 have met with May and told her that while the no-deal threat was once a valid negotiating tactic, alarming announcements by businesses and manufacturers mean it is time to categorically rule it out.

The PM is expected to visit Brussels on Wednesday while the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, will soon set out what changes he considers necessary to eliminate the risk of being trapped in the Irish backstop.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Tom Watson \u2013 \u2018I love this party but sometimes don\u2019t recognise it\u2019 Hello, it\u2019s Warren Murray on a morning when \u201cleave\u201d and \u201cremain\u201d have taken on new meaning in the Labour party. The seven MPs who have quit in frustration at Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership will go into the day hoping to persuade more parliamentary colleagues to join their grouping. If the Independent Group can convince another 29 disaffected MPs from any party to join them, they would gain official third party status \u2013 overtaking the SNP \u2013 and receive taxpayer funding. Those who resigned \u2013 Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna, along with Ann Coffey, Mike Gapes, Chris Leslie, Gavin Shuker and Angela Smith \u2013 attacked Corbyn\u2019s leadership of Labour, accusing him of betraying members and the country with his Brexit stance and presiding over a party in denial of its antisemitism problem. Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, warned that \u201ctime is short for us to confront the scale of the problem and meet the consequences, to keep others from leaving \u2026 To put it mildly, we need to be kinder and gentler. I love this party. But sometimes I no longer recognise it.\u201d There had long been rumours that dozens of Labour MPs were likely to quit but in the end the number was smaller, as some wanted to see Umunna and Berger test the water with donors, supporters and MPs from other parties. Even among those with no plans to quit, a string of Labour MPs from Yvette Cooper to Lisa Nandy have publicly made clear that they want to see change from the Labour leadership. Meanwhile there has been strong speculation that several centrist Conservative politicians are considering their future under Theresa May because of her policy towards the EU. Umunna has worked closely with Tories including Anna Soubry, the MP for Broxtowe, Heidi Allen, the MP for South Cambridgeshire, and Sarah Wollaston, the MP for Totnes, on the push for a second Brexit referendum. Of the seven who quit on Monday, Angela Smith has the slimmest electoral majority in her constituency of Penistone and Stocksbridge. At the Legion club in Penistone, opinion appeared split. \u201cI just can\u2019t vote for Angela Smith,\u201d said Mick Drewry, 66, accusing her of undermining Corbyn. But, \u201cI think she\u2019s done the right thing \u2013 I think they all have, the seven,\u201d said Angela Spivey, 61, a lifelong Labour voter until Corbyn became leader. \u201cI think it\u2019s about time we did have a new party \u2013 I would probably vote for them if they bring out good policies.\u201d * * * Rosenstein on the way out \u2013 Overnight it has emerged that Rod Rosenstein \u2013 the US deputy attorney general who appointed Robert Mueller as Trump-Russia inquisitor, to Donald Trump\u2019s fury \u2013 is to leave the White House in mid-March. It was known he would leave upon the new attorney general, William Barr, taking office to replace Jeff Sessions. But the timing of the news lines up with Rosenstein\u2019s appearance in the news in recent days, over claims that he sounded out cabinet members about using their constitutional power to dismiss Trump from the presidency. Within the last day Trump has attacked Rosenstein, accusing him of \u201cplanning a very illegal act\u201d. * * * Rule out no deal, May told \u2013 Ministers have demanded that Theresa May stop using a no-deal Brexit as a negotiating tactic because of the damage being done to British business. The point has been underlined with Honda set to announce the closure of its Swindon factory which employs 3,500 people and guarantees many more jobs in the UK automotive supply chain. It has been described as a \u201cshattering body blow\u201d for British manufacturing. Four ministers \u2013 David Gauke, Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Mundell \u2013 have met with May and told her that while the no-deal threat was once a valid negotiating tactic, alarming announcements by businesses and manufacturers mean it is time to categorically rule it out. British people are shopping on, though, according to a survey \u2013 more than half have no plans to change their spending habits. The PM is expected to visit Brussels on Wednesday while the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, will soon set out what changes he considers necessary to eliminate the risk of being trapped in the Irish backstop. The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, is due to brief cabinet today about his latest talks with the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. * * * Search for missing beachgoers \u2013 A British tourist and his French travelling companion have gone missing at an Australian beach during rough sea conditions. Police and emergency services are searching for Hugo Palmer and Erwan Ferrieux, both 20, after their belongings were found by walkers on Shelley Beach in New Wouth Wales on Monday. The men\u2019s rental car was parked nearby, probably since Sunday, and police said if they had gotten into difficulty in the water their chances of survival were \u201cexceptionally slim\u201d as weather conditions had been \u201cterrible\u201d. * * * Kurds seek protection in Syria endgame \u2013 The leader of Syria\u2019s Kurds has called for an international force to protect her people around the Turkish border. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has warned America that a Turkish military operation is imminent against the US-backed Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units. \u201cWe would like to see an international power on the border as observers to ensure that Turkey does not attack,\u201d said Ilham Ahmed, leader of the political arm of the US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which have been responsible for liberating much of north-eastern Syria from Islamic State. Erdo\u011fan views Kurdish forces in Syria as \u201cterrorists\u201d and an extension of the Kurdish separatist movement within Turkey\u2019s own borders. * * * We\u2019ll do it Huawei \u2013 The telecommunications magnate Ren Zhengfei has declared \u201cthere\u2019s no way the US can crush us\u201d as the row continues over whether his Huawei company\u2019s technology is a gateway for hacking by Chinese intelligence agencies. \u201cThe world cannot leave us because we are more advanced.

The Bristol customer was given compensation of \u00a3200. Her veganism came up during the phone call because she had applied for a loan for a nutrition diploma. NatWest said it was \u201cextremely sorry \u2026 These comments were wholly inappropriate and we have commenced disciplinary proceedings.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: What should happen to the Isis wives?

      "bodyText": "A penny on every shirt, skirt and stocking could fund better recycling and repairing in the fashion industry, according to a parliamentary report that recommends new taxes to end the throwaway consumer culture. The cross-party environmental audit committee also proposes tax incentives for companies that offer repair services for clothes, and urges schools to introduce darning and mending classes. The report warns the fashion business in the UK creates 1m tonnes of waste each year and is a bigger source of carbon emissions than aviation and shipping combined. It calls on the government to force all retailers with a turnover of more than \u00a336m to take responsibility for the waste they create. A producer responsibility charge of one penny on each item of clothing should be levied to pay for better clothing collection and recycling, it said. \u201cFashion shouldn\u2019t cost the earth. Our insatiable appetite for clothes comes with a huge social and environmental price tag: carbon emissions, water use, chemical and plastic pollution are all destroying our environment,\u201d said the Labour MP Mary Creagh, who chairs the group.

      "body": "<p>Not much remains of the Henning Motel in Newberry Springs, California. Out on old Route 66, only the once-flashing neon sign still stands, rusted beyond repair. The arrival of the Interstate Highway in the 1970s rerouted custom elsewhere, and like thousands of motels across America, its fate was sealed. These emblems of the American road seemed in steady decline, that is, until recent years, when hoteliers began to recognise the potential in their architecture and storied past, and set about repurposing them.</p> <p>The new generation of motels have co-opted the vintage aesthetics and mom-and-pop atmosphere of the 1950s and 1960s originals but given them a glossy finish with artisanal interiors, fancy linens, and locally brewed kombucha, or the like, catering to the values of the millennial traveller.</p> <p>All this comes at a price. In the 1960s a motel room was $8, roughly the equivalent of $65 today, but few renovated motels are less than $100 a night. These aren\u2019t the motels of old with their bulletproof glass, ratty net curtains and bed bugs (which do still exist): these are motels concentrated in areas likely to draw tourists, and offering more than simply a bed for the night.</p> <p>* <em>all prices include taxes and are room-only</em></p> <h2>The Drifter, New Orleans, Louisiana</h2> <p>Named after the Beat Generation writers whose antics added to the mythology of life on the road, the Drifter still has its original flashing motel sign outside, though a 2017 renovation saw it reimagined for Nola\u2019s more hedonistic tourists. The rooms are small and simple, with concrete walls and white linen; all the action is outside. Styled as a retro tropical resort, with palm trees, bright murals and Mexican tile work, it has a pool bar churning out frozen drinks and food trucks serve Haitian and Cuban food.

It\u2019s tongue-in-cheek, kitsch-yet-classy (high-quality bedding and organic bath products). At its heart is a kidney-shaped pool with red-and-white striped pool bar.

Two years later, they\u2019d packed up their lives in Texas \u2026 and Amigo Motor Lodge in Colorado was open. Within walking distance of the arty town of Salida, the motel is surrounded by the mountain trails, ski sites, hot springs and white-water rapids that draw outdoor enthusiasts to the state. The rooms are simple, and brightened by hand-woven Oaxacan textiles and lots of plants, while the atmosphere is casual and comfortable, more Airbnb than hotel \u2013 but with the couple on hand to help.

Having recently returned from New York, she bought the property in 2015 and spent the spring pulling up the thick yellow carpet, tearing down fake wood panelling and slapping white paint on everything. Now, the original cabins have pretty flower-filled window boxes and bright blue doors. The design is uncluttered: rooms are decorated with photographs, an illuminated globe, and a record player instead of a television. Records and books are available to borrow from the common room, where there\u2019s tea and coffee. The four-acre property looks out over Penobscot Bay, with a pool, barbecue grills and lawn games. Amory tells potential guests this isn\u2019t a polished resort \u2013 and, for many, that\u2019s its appeal.<br>\u2022<em> Doubles from $</em><em>105, <a href=\"https://www.lincolnvillemotel.com/\" title=\"\">lincolnvillemotel.com</a></em></p> <h2>Pioneertown Motel, Pioneertown, California</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d6431f0bbea57b1ecc639a906aba3536fb4872c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6431f0bbea57b1ecc639a906aba3536fb4872c3/0_0_1280_853/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Interior of room at Pioneertown Motel, Pioneertown, California\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The western village of Pioneertown was built as a film set in 1946 by film star and tycoon Roy Rogers, with the motel accommodating the actors. Not much had changed when brothers Matt and Mike French bought the property in 2014, but they then repurposed the 1870s-style structures into a boutique motel. The 20 rooms are kitted out by local artists with heavy textiles, cowhide rugs, and cacti.

Set in 55 acres of woodland, the motel is crossed with walkways guiding guests to the river, pool, yoga pavilion, outdoor art installations \u2013 and a 19th-century former farmhouse, which, in late February, will open a restaurant, The Airport Rooms. All-day food and cocktails are available in the lounge-like Lodge, and unlike many motels, it offers room service, too. There is also a line-up of live events and an emphasis on communal spaces.

There\u2019s a Tesla charging station and the rooms have Apple TVs and heated toilet seats. In the communal lobby, line up for complimentary Stumptown coffee and breakfast waffles.

On Maker Mondays, local artisans give craft lessons.

The arrival of the Interstate Highway in the 1970s rerouted custom elsewhere, and like thousands of motels across America, its fate was sealed. These emblems of the American road seemed in steady decline, that is, until recent years, when hoteliers began to recognise the potential in their architecture and storied past, and set about repurposing them. The new generation of motels have co-opted the vintage aesthetics and mom-and-pop atmosphere of the 1950s and 1960s originals but given them a glossy finish with artisanal interiors, fancy linens, and locally brewed kombucha, or the like, catering to the values of the millennial traveller. All this comes at a price. In the 1960s a motel room was $8, roughly the equivalent of $65 today, but few renovated motels are less than $100 a night. These aren\u2019t the motels of old with their bulletproof glass, ratty net curtains and bed bugs (which do still exist): these are motels concentrated in areas likely to draw tourists, and offering more than simply a bed for the night. * all prices include taxes and are room-only The Drifter, New Orleans, Louisiana Named after the Beat Generation writers whose antics added to the mythology of life on the road, the Drifter still has its original flashing motel sign outside, though a 2017 renovation saw it reimagined for Nola\u2019s more hedonistic tourists. The rooms are small and simple, with concrete walls and white linen; all the action is outside. Styled as a retro tropical resort, with palm trees, bright murals and Mexican tile work, it has a pool bar churning out frozen drinks and food trucks serve Haitian and Cuban food. There\u2019s a pool party here most weekends, with DJs and flamingo inflatables aplenty \u2013 also, a no-kids policy. \u2022 Doubles from $103, thedrifterhotel.com Austin Motel, Austin, Texas Liz Lambert is often cited as the pioneer of the roadside motel revival, renovating her first property in Texas two decades ago. She has a knack for turning a hotel into a hotspot and the Austin Motel is no different. Reopening it in 2017, Lambert stayed true to the motel\u2019s retro roots with lurid red-lipped wallpaper, tufted-vinyl platform beds, old school push-button phones, and silk-screened music posters. It\u2019s tongue-in-cheek, kitsch-yet-classy (high-quality bedding and organic bath products). At its heart is a kidney-shaped pool with red-and-white striped pool bar. Tex-Mex style diner Joann\u2019s Fine Foods opened inside the motel in 2018 and offers breakfast tacos and all-day dining (not included in room price). In continuous operation since 1938, the hotel was once nicknamed the Phallus Palace for its phallic sign, still flashing passersby to this day. \u2022 Doubles from $135, austinmotel.com Amigo Motor Lodge, Salida, Colorado Husband and wife Philip Sterling and Kaitlyn Canfield flirted over the idea of opening a motel on their first date, in 2014. Two years later, they\u2019d packed up their lives in Texas \u2026 and Amigo Motor Lodge in Colorado was open. Within walking distance of the arty town of Salida, the motel is surrounded by the mountain trails, ski sites, hot springs and white-water rapids that draw outdoor enthusiasts to the state. The rooms are simple, and brightened by hand-woven Oaxacan textiles and lots of plants, while the atmosphere is casual and comfortable, more Airbnb than hotel \u2013 but with the couple on hand to help. There are also three renovated Airstreams that can be booked, a hot tub, a teepee and a fire pit. \u2022 Doubles from $115, stayamigo.com Lincolnville Motel, Lincolnville, Maine When chef Alice Amory first saw the faded six-room Seaview Motel and Cottages for sale she decided this was the life challenge she needed. Having recently returned from New York, she bought the property in 2015 and spent the spring pulling up the thick yellow carpet, tearing down fake wood panelling and slapping white paint on everything. Now, the original cabins have pretty flower-filled window boxes and bright blue doors. The design is uncluttered: rooms are decorated with photographs, an illuminated globe, and a record player instead of a television. Records and books are available to borrow from the common room, where there\u2019s tea and coffee. The four-acre property looks out over Penobscot Bay, with a pool, barbecue grills and lawn games. Amory tells potential guests this isn\u2019t a polished resort \u2013 and, for many, that\u2019s its appeal. \u2022 Doubles from $105, lincolnvillemotel.com Pioneertown Motel, Pioneertown, California The western village of Pioneertown was built as a film set in 1946 by film star and tycoon Roy Rogers, with the motel accommodating the actors. Not much had changed when brothers Matt and Mike French bought the property in 2014, but they then repurposed the 1870s-style structures into a boutique motel. The 20 rooms are kitted out by local artists with heavy textiles, cowhide rugs, and cacti. The motel hosts DJ sets and yoga classes for the creative community that has sprung up around this surreal outpost. For food, head across the road to the town saloon, Pappy &amp; Harriet\u2019s. Shop for vintage denim and hand-blown glass crafts on Mane Street \u2013 and then watch a staged wild-west shootout. The real attraction, however, is the neighbouring mystical desert landscapes of Joshua Tree national park. \u2022 Doubles from $185, pioneertown-motel.com Tourists, North Adams, Massachusetts In a thriving cultural destination in want of good accommodation for years, this motor lodge was ripe for renovation \u2013 and reopened in 2018. The Berkshires is home to the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art and the Clark Art Institute, not to mention outstanding hiking. Set in 55 acres of woodland, the motel is crossed with walkways guiding guests to the river, pool, yoga pavilion, outdoor art installations \u2013 and a 19th-century former farmhouse, which, in late February, will open a restaurant, The Airport Rooms. All-day food and cocktails are available in the lounge-like Lodge, and unlike many motels, it offers room service, too. There is also a line-up of live events and an emphasis on communal spaces. The rooms are airy and bright, with lots of blond wood and natural beauty products in the bathrooms. \u2022 Doubles from $199, touristswelcome.com Coachman Hotel, Lake Tahoe, California Originally built to cater to the tourism boom from the 1960 Winter Olympics at Squaw Valley, this motel had fallen into disrepair before its multimillion dollar overhaul in 2016. Now the 42-room hotel at the base of Heavenly Mountain is an upscale ski lodge with a hint of the retro motel it once was. There\u2019s a Tesla charging station and the rooms have Apple TVs and heated toilet seats. In the communal lobby, line up for complimentary Stumptown coffee and breakfast waffles. In the evening there\u2019s a small bar with wine and beer. Outdoors there\u2019s a pool, hot tubs and fire pits. Most importantly, the ski gondola is just steps away. \u2022 Doubles from $137, coachmantahoe.com Anvil Hotel, Jackson, Wyoming Discover the gateway to the rugged terrain of Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks or some of the state\u2019s best skiing in Jackson Hole. The jump-off point is the outdoorsy town of Jackson, where the 49-room Anvil Hotel, a former 1950s motor lodge, reopened in 2017, packed to its wooden rafters with mountain charm. The Shaker-design rooms have cast-iron beds and thick, custom-designed woollen blankets, and guests are encouraged into communal areas: the lobby, which doubles as a hip take on a General Store, has a wood-burning stove and coffee from the local town roastery; and the onsite restaurant, Glorietta, serves wood-fired Italian dishes and cocktails by NYC\u2019s Death &amp; Co. The hotel will also help with a build-your-own adventure from a roster of snowmobiling, snowshoeing and dogsledding. \u2022 Doubles from $110, anvilhotel.com The Astro, Santa Rosa, California Once a roadside dump with a by-the-hour reputation, this motel was boosted by the resurgence of Santa Rosa\u2019s SoFa Arts District, including local chef Liza Hinman\u2019s restaurant The Spinster Sisters, a Sonoma County favourite. Hinman recognised the potential of the Astro, built in 1963, and refurbished the property to open in January 2018. Hinman employed local artists for the interiors, with the LED rocket ship sign outside setting the tone, and each of the 34 rooms pop with retro colour. Local drinks and snacks are available in the rooms and the lounge offers complimentary coffee, fruit and fresh pastries every morning. Every item you can see, from the antique rugs to the art, is for sale, too. \u2022 Doubles from $178, theastro.com Calistoga Motor Lodge and Spa, Napa Valley, California This motor lodge is a holiday camp worthy of a Tenenbaum family retreat. The original 1940s Sunburst Motel was renovated in 2017, with a Wes Anderson-esque twee charm that appeals to younger travellers. The rooms are inspired Airstream caravans and have camper banquettes and corkboards pinned with maps and photos. Family-friendly activities include bocce, board games and hula hooping. On Maker Mondays, local artisans give craft lessons. Even the signage is cute: pool rules include, \u201cDo not attempt duet event without partner.\u201d Three mineral pools are fed by geothermal hot springs and there are DIY mud baths in the mud bar. There\u2019s in-room organic coffee and free snacks in the lobby but plans are afoot for an restaurant later this year. It\u2019s near many trails and wineries, and it\u2019s possible to pick up a pair of binoculars and a bicycle, and set off into the Napa Valley. \u2022 Doubles from $198, calistogamotorlodgeandspa.com",

More than half of consumers in the nationwide survey told the accountancy firm PwC they had not, and would not, alter their spending habits over the course of this year as a consequence of Brexit. According to the study of more than 2,000 shoppers carried out in December, parts of Britain with higher proportions of leave voters were more likely to say they would not change their plans. As many as 70% of consumers in north-east England said they had not changed their spending plans last year and would not do so in 2019, versus 41% of shoppers in London saying they had already curtailed their spending. Kien Tan, the retail strategy director of PwC, said that Brexit fears were likelier to have an impact on spending in wealthier areas as poorer consumers had less spending to curb in the first place. \u201cThe reality is that all this stuff is going on politically but, in terms of people\u2019s day-to-day lives, it really only affects certain groups of people,\u201d he added.

We wrote romantic songs with historically based themes. We were happy in our niche and certainly never thought of ourselves as a pop group. At first, I thought Don\u2019t Fear the Reaper would be played on album-oriented radio, like all our other songs. I never dreamed it would become such a famous song, or that the riff would be played by every kid trying out a guitar in a shop.</p> <p>The riff actually came first and the opening lines \u2013 \u201cAll our times have come / Here but now they\u2019re gone\u201d \u2013 just spun into my head fully formed. I was 22 and had just been diagnosed with an irregular heart condition, which got me thinking about dying young. Don\u2019t Fear the Reaper is basically a love song that imagines there is something after death and that, once in a while, you can bridge that gap to the other side.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The line '40,000 men and women every day' was a wild guess about how many people in the world die. I was 100,000 out</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I imagined a couple: one of them dies but is able to come back for her lover, and they go to this other place no one knows about. I sang about Romeo and Juliet as an example of a couple who have successfully gone to the other dimension, but I got a lot of grief over it because everyone thought I was promoting suicide. \u201cRomeo and Juliet are together in eternity,\u201d I sang, but I wasn\u2019t suggesting that people kill themselves to find out what it\u2019s like.</p> <p>The line \u201c40,000 men and women every day\u201d was my wild guess about how many people in the world die daily. I didn\u2019t research it \u2013 and it turned out that I was about 100,000 out. But I just needed a number I could sing.</p> <p>The song\u2019s really about accepting the inevitability of death. At concerts, we tend to dedicate it to people who have recently passed on, musicians and such. I wonder how many people have been buried to it. I want it played at my funeral on a loop. It\u2019s become the song that we\u2019re most known for. People ask: \u201cDon\u2019t you wish you had more songs as popular as that one?\u201d I don\u2019t see it like that. I\u2019m fortunate to have just one.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4HA3vUv2c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Dy4HA3vUv2c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2><strong>Eric Bloom, guitarist</strong></h2> <p>When we started the band, we all lived in one house in Long Island, New York. Everyone would pitch in, either in the basement or the living room, meaning songs were written en masse. But by 1976, when Reaper came out, we all had home studios and would write on our own. Donald brought Reaper to rehearsals on a demo he\u2019d recorded himself. It was very close to how the finished thing sounded.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There's a cowbell all the way through. Now the phrase 'more cowbell' has become a part of the language</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The original version, however, had a totally different \u2013 and very long \u2013 middle section that was cut out for the single. Shortly after it came out, we landed a slot on the <a href=\"http://mervgriffin.com/\">Merv Griffin</a> TV show, a popular talk show. We\u2019d never done lip sync before but figured that we didn\u2019t need to rehearse since we knew the song so well. What we didn\u2019t know was that they were going to use the single version. So when it came to the middle section, it just wasn\u2019t there. We stood there like idiots, blowing it on national television. It was obvious we didn\u2019t have a clue what was going on, but it was funny \u2013 and certainly didn\u2019t stop the song being a hit.</p> <p>Don\u2019t Fear the Reaper has a cowbell all the way through it, which is quite unusual. None of us can quite remember who played it. Saturday Night Live did a hilarious skit about us called <a href=\"http://www.for-those-about-to-rock.com/funny/cowbell.htm\">More Cowbell</a> and the phrase has since become part of the English language. It\u2019s something I get asked about all the time. I was reading Autoweek, an American car magazine. In the middle of a car review, along with some stuff about acceleration, it suddenly said: \u201cWhat this car needs is more cowbell.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Blue \u00d6yster Cult play the University of East Anglia, Norwich, on 21 February. <a href=\"http://blueoystercult.com/Road-main.html\">Then touring the UK until 1 March</a>.</p>",

I was 22 and had just been diagnosed with an irregular heart condition, which got me thinking about dying young. Don\u2019t Fear the Reaper is basically a love song that imagines there is something after death and that, once in a while, you can bridge that gap to the other side. I imagined a couple: one of them dies but is able to come back for her lover, and they go to this other place no one knows about. I sang about Romeo and Juliet as an example of a couple who have successfully gone to the other dimension, but I got a lot of grief over it because everyone thought I was promoting suicide. \u201cRomeo and Juliet are together in eternity,\u201d I sang, but I wasn\u2019t suggesting that people kill themselves to find out what it\u2019s like. The line \u201c40,000 men and women every day\u201d was my wild guess about how many people in the world die daily. I didn\u2019t research it \u2013 and it turned out that I was about 100,000 out. But I just needed a number I could sing. The song\u2019s really about accepting the inevitability of death. At concerts, we tend to dedicate it to people who have recently passed on, musicians and such. I wonder how many people have been buried to it. I want it played at my funeral on a loop. It\u2019s become the song that we\u2019re most known for. People ask: \u201cDon\u2019t you wish you had more songs as popular as that one?\u201d I don\u2019t see it like that. I\u2019m fortunate to have just one. Eric Bloom, guitarist When we started the band, we all lived in one house in Long Island, New York. Everyone would pitch in, either in the basement or the living room, meaning songs were written en masse. But by 1976, when Reaper came out, we all had home studios and would write on our own. Donald brought Reaper to rehearsals on a demo he\u2019d recorded himself. It was very close to how the finished thing sounded. The original version, however, had a totally different \u2013 and very long \u2013 middle section that was cut out for the single. Shortly after it came out, we landed a slot on the Merv Griffin TV show, a popular talk show. We\u2019d never done lip sync before but figured that we didn\u2019t need to rehearse since we knew the song so well. What we didn\u2019t know was that they were going to use the single version. So when it came to the middle section, it just wasn\u2019t there. We stood there like idiots, blowing it on national television. It was obvious we didn\u2019t have a clue what was going on, but it was funny \u2013 and certainly didn\u2019t stop the song being a hit. Don\u2019t Fear the Reaper has a cowbell all the way through it, which is quite unusual. None of us can quite remember who played it. Saturday Night Live did a hilarious skit about us called More Cowbell and the phrase has since become part of the English language. It\u2019s something I get asked about all the time. I was reading Autoweek, an American car magazine. In the middle of a car review, along with some stuff about acceleration, it suddenly said: \u201cWhat this car needs is more cowbell.\u201d \u2022 Blue \u00d6yster Cult play the University of East Anglia, Norwich, on 21 February.

      "body": "<p>Once upon a time in a land far, far away, there grew a magical fruit. This fruit could be squeezed to produce a very special kind of oil that made cookies more healthy, soap more bubbly and crisps more crispy. The oil could even make lipstick smoother and keep ice-cream from melting. Because of these wondrous qualities, people came from around the world to buy the fruit and its oil.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/mar/08/how-the-world-got-hooked-on-palm-oil-podcast\">How the world got hooked on palm oil \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the places where the fruit came from, people burned down the forest so they could plant more trees that grew the fruit \u2013 making lots of nasty smoke and sending all of the creatures of the forest scurrying away. When the trees were burned, they emitted a gas that heated up the air. Then everybody was upset, because they loved the forest\u2019s creatures and thought the temperature was warm enough already. A few people decided they shouldn\u2019t use the oil any more, but mostly things went on as before, and the forest kept burning.</p> <p>This is a true story. Except that it is not magic. The fruit of the oil palm tree (<em>Elaeis guineensis</em>), which grows in tropical climates, contains the world\u2019s most versatile vegetable oil. It can handle frying without spoiling, and blends well with other oils. Its combination of different types of fats and its consistency after refining make it a popular ingredient in packaged baked goods. Its low production costs make it cheaper than frying oils such as cottonseed or sunflower. It provides the foaming agent in virtually every shampoo, liquid soap or detergent. Cosmetics manufacturers prefer it to animal tallow for its ease of application and low price. It is increasingly used as a cheap raw material for biofuels, especially in the European Union. It functions as a natural preservative in processed foods, and actually does raise the melting point of ice-cream. Palm oil can be used as an adhesive that binds together the particles in fibreboard. Oil palm trunks and fronds can be made into everything from plywood to the composite body of <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysian-pm-mahathir-says-growing-countries-need-different-trade-protections\" title=\"\">Malaysia\u2019s national automobile</a>.</p> <p>Worldwide production of palm oil has been climbing steadily for five decades. Between 1995 and 2015, annual production quadrupled, from 15.2m tonnes to 62.6m tonnes. By 2050, it is expected to quadruple again, reaching 240m tonnes. The footprint of palm oil production is astounding: plantations to produce it <a href=\"http://www.worldagroforestry.org/downloads/Publications/PDFS/OP16401.pdf\">account for 10%</a> of permanent global cropland. Today, 3 billion people in 150 countries use products containing palm oil. Globally, we each consume an average of 8kg of palm oil a year.</p> <p>Of this, 85% comes from Malaysia and Indonesia, where worldwide demand for palm oil has lifted incomes, especially in rural areas \u2013 but at the cost of tremendous environmental devastation and often with attendant <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2016/11/29/news/economy/palm-oil-labor-abuses-amnesty/\" title=\"\">labour and human rights abuses</a>. Fires set to clear forests and create land for more palm plantations are the top source of greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia, a country of 261 million people. The financial incentive to produce more palm oil is helping to warm the planet, while destroying the only habitat of Sumatran tigers, Sumatran rhinos and orangutans \u2013 driving them towards extinction.</p> <p>Yet consumers are often unaware they are even using the stuff. <a href=\"https://www.palmoilinvestigations.org/\" title=\"\">Palm Oil Investigations</a>, which dubs itself \u201cthe palm oil watchdog\u201d, lists more than 200 common ingredients in food and home and personal care products containing palm oil, only about 10% of which include the telltale word \u201cpalm\u201d.</p> <p>How did palm oil insinuate itself into every corner of our lives? No single innovation caused palm oil consumption to soar. Instead, it was the perfect commodity at the right moment for industry after industry, each of which adopted it to replace ingredients and never turned back. At the same time, producing nations view palm oil as a poverty-reduction scheme, while international finance organisations view it as a growth engine for developing economies. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has pushed Malaysia and Indonesia to produce more.</p> <p>As the palm industry expanded, conservationists and environmental organisations such as Greenpeace started to raise the alarm about its devastating effects on carbon emissions and wildlife habitat. (However, it is not impossible to produce palm oil sustainably, and several organisations certify sustainable producers.) In response, a backlash against palm oil has developed: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/10/iceland-to-be-first-uk-supermarket-to-cut-palm-oil-from-own-brand-products\" title=\"\">last April, the supermarket Iceland pledged</a> that it would cut palm oil from all its own-brand foods by the end of 2018. In December, Norway banned imports for biofuel production.</p> <p>But by the time awareness of palm oil\u2019s impact had spread, it was so deeply embedded in the consumer economy that it now may be too late to remove it. (Tellingly, Iceland found it impossible to fulfill its 2018 pledge. Instead, the company ended up <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46984349\" title=\"\">removing its branding</a> from foods containing palm oil rather than removing palm oil from all of its branded foods.)</p> <p>Determining which products contain palm oil, let alone how sustainably it has been sourced, requires an almost supernatural level of consumer consciousness. In any case, greater consumer awareness in the west will not have much impact, given that Europe and the US account for less than 14% of global demand. More than half of global demand comes from Asia.</p> <p>It was a good 20 years after the first alarms about deforestation in Brazil that consumer action slowed \u2013 not stopped \u2013 the destruction. With palm oil, \u201cthe reality is that the western part of world is [a small share] of palm oil consumption, and the rest of the world doesn\u2019t give a shit\u201d, said Neil Blomquist, managing director of Colorado-based Natural Habitats, which produces palm oil in Ecuador and Sierra Leone to the highest level of sustainability certification. \u201cSo there\u2019s not much incentive to change.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Palm oil\u2019s world domination is the result of five factors: first, it has replaced less healthy fats in foods in the west. Second, producers have pushed to keep its price low. Third, it has replaced more expensive oils in home and personal care products. Fourth, again because it is cheap, it has been widely adopted as cooking oil in Asian countries. Finally, as those Asian countries have grown richer, they have begun to consume more fat, much of it in the form of palm oil.</p> <p>Widespread adoption of palm oil began with processed foods. In the 1960s, scientists began to warn that butter\u2019s high saturated fat content may increase the risk of heart disease. Food manufacturers, including the British-Dutch conglomerate Unilever, began to replace it with margarine, made with vegetable oils low in saturated fat. By the early 1990s, though, it became clear that the process by which the oils in margarine were made, known as partial hydrogenation, actually created a different kind of fat \u2013 trans fat \u2013 that was even unhealthier than saturated fat. The Unilever board of directors saw a scientific consensus forming against trans fat and decided to get rid of it. \u201cUnilever was always very conscious of the health interests of consumers of its products,\u201d said James W Kinnear, a Unilever board member at the time.</p> <p>The switchover happened suddenly. In 1994, a Unilever refineries manager named Gerrit van Duijn received a call from his bosses in Rotterdam. Twenty Unilever plants in 15 countries needed to remove partially hydrogenated oils from 600 fat blends and replace them with trans-fat free components.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3d8d124d63c4227abeea7fc22c0a7c67847195a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d8d124d63c4227abeea7fc22c0a7c67847195a6/0_260_3980_2389/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A fire at an oil palm plantation in Pekanbaru, Sumatra, due to intensive farming methods and the dry season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fire at an oil palm plantation in Pekanbaru, Sumatra, due to intensive farming methods and the dry season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The project, for reasons Van Duijn can\u2019t explain, was called \u201cPaddington\u201d. First, he needed to figure out what could replace trans fat while maintaining its favourable properties, such as remaining solid at room temperature \u2013 a necessity for inexpensive butter substitutes as well as manufactured goods such as cookies. In the end, there was only one choice: oil from the oil palm tree \u2013 either palm oil (extracted from the fruit) or palm kernel oil (from the seed). No other oil could be refined to the consistency needed for Unilever\u2019s various margarine blends and baked goods without producing trans fat. It was the only alternative to partially hydrogenated oils, Van Duijn told me. Palm oil and palm kernel oil were also lower in saturated fat than butter.</p> <p>The switch at each plant had to occur simultaneously \u2013 the production lines couldn\u2019t handle a mixture of the old oils and the new. \u201cOn a certain day, all these tanks had to be emptied of trans-containing components and refilled with trans-free components,\u201d Van Duijn said. \u201cLogistically, that was quite a nightmare.\u201d (Purchasing additional tanks would have been too expensive.)</p> <p>As Unilever had sometimes used palm oil previously, a supply chain was already up and running. But it took six weeks for the raw material to be shipped from Malaysia to Europe, and Van Duijn had three months to make the switch. He started to buy more and more palm and palm kernel oils, arranging for the shipments to be trucked in to the various plants on schedule. Then one day in 1995, with trucks queued up outside Unilever plants across Europe, it was done.</p> <p>It was a moment that changed the processed food industry forever. Unilever was the trailblazer; after Van Duijn organised the company\u2019s switch to palm oil, virtually every other food manufacturer followed. In 2001, the American Heart Association issued a statement declaring that \u201cthe optimal diet for reducing risk of chronic diseases is one in which saturated fatty acids are reduced and trans fatty acids from manufactured fats are virtually eliminated\u201d. Today, more than two-thirds of palm oil goes into food. Consumption in the EU more than tripled between Project Paddington and 2015. That same year, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave food manufacturers three years to get rid of all trans fats from every margarine, cookie, cake, pie, popcorn, frozen pizza, doughnut and biscuit sold in the US. Virtually all of it has now been replaced with palm oil.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>For all the palm oil that now goes into food in Europe and the US, Asia uses far more: India, China, and Indonesia account for nearly 40% of all palm oil consumed worldwide. Where they once cooked with soya oil, palm oil has replaced it. Growth has been fastest in India, where an accelerating economy has been another factor in palm oil\u2019s newfound popularity.</p> <p>One of the commonalities of economic development, across the globe and throughout history, is that a population\u2019s consumption of fat grows in lockstep with its income, and the subcontinent has been no exception. Between 1993 and 2013, Indian per capita GDP expanded from $298 to $1,452. Over the same period, fat consumption in rural areas grew by 35% and in urban areas by 25%, and palm oil has been a major ingredient in this escalation. Government-subsidised \u201cfair price shops\u201d, a food distribution network for the poor, started selling imported palm oil in 1978, mainly for cooking; two years later the 290,000 shops were unloading 273,500 tonnes. By 1995, Indian imports of palm oil had climbed to nearly 1m tonnes, reaching more than 9m tonnes by 2015. In those years, the poverty rate fell by half while the population climbed by 36%.</p> <p>But palm oil is no longer just used for home cooking in India \u2013 today it is a big part of the country\u2019s growing junk food industry. India\u2019s fast food market grew 83% just between 2011 and 2016. Between them, Domino\u2019s Pizza, Subway, Pizza Hut, KFC, McDonald\u2019s and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts \u2013 all of which use palm oil \u2013 now have 2,784 stores in the country, according to reporting by the Nation. Packaged-food sales spiked 138% over roughly the same period; for pennies, you can buy dozens of packaged snacks containing palm oil.</p> <p>Palm oil\u2019s versatility is not limited to food. Unlike other oils, it can be easily and inexpensively \u201cfractionated\u201d \u2013 separated into oils of different consistencies \u2013 which disposes it to multiple uses. \u201cIt has a tremendous advantage because of its versatility,\u201d said Carl Bek-Nielsen, chief executive director of United Plantations Berhad, a Malaysia-based palm oil producer.</p> <p>Not long after the processed food business discovered the magical properties of palm oil, industries as diverse as personal care products and transport fuel would also begin using it to replace other oils. But just as trans fats were chosen for perceived benefits, only to turn out to be worse than what they had replaced, palm oil was initially adopted in large part for its perceived environmental friendliness.</p> <p>As palm oil became more widely used in food the world over, it was also replacing animal products in cleaning products and personal care items such as soap, shampoo, lotion and makeup. Today, 70% of personal care items contain one or more palm oil derivatives.</p> <p>Historically, soap often came from animal tallow, and shampoo, which originated on the Indian subcontinent, was first made with plant-based surfactants (a substance that acts as a detergent, emulsifier or foaming agent). Later, synthetic ingredients came into favour, with animal tallow joining them in the 20th century. In the 1980s, the personal care industry started to notice a consumer preference for \u201cnatural\u201d ingredients, which \u201ca lot of consumers figured was synonymous with plant-based rather than animal-based\u201d, said Chris Sayner, vice-president for corporate sustainability at Croda, a chemical company. Croda\u2019s customers started asking if it could come up with plant-based surfactant formulations without tallow.</p> <p>Just as Van Duijn had discovered at Unilever, the composition of palm oil and palm kernel oil made them the perfect substitute. Manufacturers looking for alternatives found that palm and palm kernel oils contain the same set of fat types as tallow. No other alternative could provide the same advantages across such a wide range of products. \u201cAlternate sources [to tallow] were looked at,\u201d Sayner recalled. \u201cPalm and palm kernel oil dropped in as the replacement.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"56ae269acc359da631a93ea4cf62167a674bd9e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56ae269acc359da631a93ea4cf62167a674bd9e0/0_94_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A deforested palm oil concession in Papua, Indonesia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A deforested palm oil concession in Papua, Indonesia. <br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ulet  Ifansasti/Greenpeace</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sayner believes that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/oct/26/bse3\" title=\"\">BSE outbreak</a> of the early 1990s, when a brain disease among cattle spread to some people who ate beef, triggered a larger shift in consumption habits. \u201cPublic opinion, brand equity and marketing all came together to move away from animal-based products in more fashion-oriented industries like personal care.\u201d Companies across Europe and the US that Croda supplied started to make the switch.</p> <p>The change from animal-based fats to palm oil came with a certain irony. In the past, when tallow was used in products such as soaps, a byproduct of the meat industry \u2013 animal fat \u2013 was put to good use. Now, in response to consumers\u2019 desire for ingredients perceived as more \u201cnatural,\u201d the makers of soaps, detergents and cosmetics have replaced a local waste product with one that must be transported thousands of miles and that causes environmental destruction in the countries where it is produced. (Although, of course, the meat industry comes with its own environmental harm.) \u201cWhat\u2019s better environmentally than using a byproduct that exists on your doorstep?\u201d Sayner asked.</p> <p>A similar thing happened with biofuels \u2013 the intent to reduce environmental harm had unintended consequences. In 1997, a <a href=\"http://europa.eu/documents/comm/white_papers/pdf/com97_599_en.pdf\" title=\"\">European commission report</a> called for increasing the percentage of total energy consumption from renewable sources. Three years later it <a href=\"https://iet.jrc.ec.europa.eu/remea/sites/remea/files/green_paper_energy_supply_en.pdf\" title=\"\">cited the environmental benefits</a> of biofuels for transport, and in 2009 adopted the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), which included a 10% target for the share of transport fuels coming from biofuels by 2020.</p> <p>Unlike in food and home and personal care products, where palm\u2019s chemical makeup makes it the perfect alternative, when it comes to biofuel, palm, soybean, rapeseed and sunflower oils all perform equally well. But palm has one big advantage over these rival oils: price.</p> <p>The EU policies \u201ccreated an unprecedented market for the uptake of palm oil,\u201d said Kalyana Sundram, CEO of the Malaysian Palm Oil Council, a trade group. Legislative attempts in the west to curb the environmental harm of fossil fuels \u2013 the US adopted its own biofuel mandate in 2007 \u2013 had severe environmental consequences in less developed countries, contributing significantly to global warming.</p> <p>EU palm oil imports shot up 15% the year after the RED, reaching an all-time high, and 19% the year after that, as biofuel use tripled in the EU between 2011 and 2014; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/01/leaked-figures-show-spike-in-palm-oil-use-for-biodiesel-in-europe\" title=\"\">palm oil\u2019s share of biofuel raw material leapt fivefold in that period</a>. Half of the EU\u2019s palm oil now goes to biofuel, double the share prior to the RED. Sustainability criteria were later added \u2013 although Oxfam and others have criticised their effectiveness \u2013 and earlier this month European commissioners <a href=\"https://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFL5N2065S2\" title=\"\">proposed new limits</a> on biofuel crops tied to deforestation. But the damage had already been done.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The oil palm is blessed with many attributes that have helped it on its path to dominance. It is perennial and evergreen, enabling year-round production. It is exceptionally efficient at photosynthesis for a perennial tree, and requires less preparation of the soil than other sources of vegetable oils, reducing costs. It can succeed in soils that can\u2019t sustain other crops. Most importantly, it gives the highest yield per acre of any oilseed crop \u2013 almost five times as much oil per acre as rapeseed, almost six times as much as sunflower and more than eight times as much as soybeans. Boycotts of palm oil will only lead to its replacement by other crops needing far more farmland and likely more deforestation.</p> <p>\u201cThe cost of production is far less than any compared [comparable] vegetable or animal fat,\u201d said Sundram, of the Malaysian Palm Oil Council. \u201cIndustry is simply palming off the benefits to the consumer.\u201d</p> <p>For decades, palm\u2019s production advantage went unrealised, until a Scot named Leslie Davidson instigated perhaps the most significant innovation in the industry\u2019s history. Davidson had come to British Malaya in 1951 at the age of 20 to work on a Unilever plantation. Four years later, the company transferred him to Cameroon. The oil palm originated in west Africa, and had been introduced from there to Malaysia in 1875. In Cameroon, Davidson noticed that insects resembling rice weevils surrounded palm fruits. In Malaya, the plantations were employing hundreds of people to hand-pollinate the flowers, yet pollination occurred more efficiently in Cameroon.</p> <p>When Unilever sent Davidson back to Malaya (now Malaysia) in 1960, he told his bosses he thought the Malaysian industry was going about pollination all wrong, and that insects were the natural pollinators of oil palm. \u201cThey told him to mind your own business and don\u2019t get involved,\u201d said Carl Bek-Nielsen, who knew Davidson.</p> <p>In 1974, Davidson became vice-chair of Unilever International Plantations Group. He recruited three entomologists, led by the Pakistani scientist Rahman Syed, who travelled to Cameroon to investigate. Eventually Syed determined that Davidson\u2019s hunch was correct: a particular species of weevil was pollinating the oil palm trees, and Davidson received permission from the Malaysian government to import some.</p> <p>On 21 February, 1981, 2,000 <em>Elaeidobius kamerunicus</em> were released at Unilever\u2019s Mamor estate in Johor. Results were seen immediately, with no adverse effects, and the pollinating weevils were distributed across Malaysia. The following year, the country saw an increase in yield of 400,000 tonnes of palm oil and 300,000 tonnes of palm kernels.</p> <p>The new pollination technique was a key factor in palm oil\u2019s growth. As yields climbed, and the cost of labour to manually pollinate the trees was more efficiently deployed for picking the fruit, there was an explosion in the volume of land devoted to oil-palm plantations. Davidson had radically changed the future of Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b37897a3598c167a0d72f8c11bbbc7d6f1e45069\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b37897a3598c167a0d72f8c11bbbc7d6f1e45069/0_167_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A worker with palm oil fruits at a plantation in Mamuju, Indonesia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A worker with palm oil fruits at a plantation in Mamuju, Indonesia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antara Foto Agency/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the changes wouldn\u2019t have occurred without pushes from policymakers in both countries. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of effort from both governments into supporting the sector because it\u2019s an easy way to develop the economy,\u201d said Raquel Moreno-Pe\u00f1aranda, research fellow at United Nations University\u2019s Institute of Advanced Studies in Tokyo, who studies agricultural systems and advises governments. Malaysia\u2019s minister of primary industries, Teresa Kok, told the European Palm Oil Conference in Madrid in October: \u201cPalm oil is synonymous with poverty eradication.\u201d Malaysia began its programme to boost palm exports as a means of poverty reduction in 1961, four years after independence from Britain. Rubber had been a key crop, but with prices falling, the government initiated a programme to replace rubber plantations with oil palm. In 1968, Malaysia provided palm oil producers with a series of tax breaks. Industry subsequently invested heavily in milling technology to extract the oil from the fruit. In the early 1970s, fractionation was developed, expanding the applications of palm oil for both food and other uses.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/ng-interactive/2014/nov/10/palm-oil-rainforest-cupboard-interactive\">From rainforest to your cupboard: the real story of palm oil - interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More recently, plantation owners have found profitable uses for waste such as empty fruit bunches, palm fronds, palm fruit peels, and palm kernel shells. Mill effluent that was once dumped into nearby streams now produces electricity. These new revenue streams reduce planters\u2019 risk by providing income even when palm oil prices are down (such as right now), and have helped them face headwinds such as the increasing costs of labour and fertiliser.</p> <p>But the push for increased palm oil production has not only come from inside Malaysia and Indonesia. World Bank policies in the 1970s encouraged the Indonesian government to expand palm among small farmers. The 1998 economic crisis in Asia shattered exports of manufactured goods from the region, but commodity exports, which were sold in dollars, \u201ccame in like a life vest in rough choppy seas,\u201d Bek-Nielsen recalled. The IMF\u2019s bailout package for Indonesia required that it generate revenue by cultivating natural resources and erase export taxes the government had imposed to keep prices low at home. The measures further incentivised expansion of palm plantations. Alongside the IMF, private finance has helped boost production: <a href=\"http://www.kaoemtelapak.org/wp-content/uploads/2000/03/2000march_funding_forestdestruction.pdf\" title=\"\">Dutch banks alone</a> provided more than $12bn in loans to Indonesian palm producers in the years 1995-99.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The short-term benefits to plantation owners and labourers, producer-nations\u2019 governments and financiers have come with enormous long-term costs to the global climate. Forests destroyed for oil palm plantations are among the most carbon-rich in the world. When they are burned, that carbon is released.</p> <p>Palm oil now accounts for 13.7% of Malaysia\u2019s gross national income and is Indonesia\u2019s top export. In October, at the European Palm Oil Association meeting in Madrid, government officials from the two countries trumpeted the successes in poverty reduction they had achieved thanks to palm oil (though growers in Indonesia, at least, have <a href=\"https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/11/03/farmers-dispute-palm-oil-prosperity-claims-environment.html\" title=\"\">disputed these claims, calling on government and industry to do more for farmers independent of the big plantations</a>). Officials further insisted that deforestation was being halted and sustainability achieved, even as another speaker told the attendees deforestation had actually increased in some areas over the previous decade. (In September, Indonesia\u2019s president signed a three-year moratorium on new palm-plantation development.)</p> <p>Commodity-producing countries need only answer to their buyers, though, while those buyers must respond to consumers. In 2004, the environmental NGO Friends of the Earth UK <a href=\"https://friendsoftheearth.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/greasy_palms_summary.pdf\" title=\"\">released a report</a> detailing deforestation rates from palm-oil production. As the outcry spread, and concern rose among producers that the continued deforestation would become a risk to their reputations, the World Wildlife Federation that year convinced a small number of palm growers, manufacturers and retailers to establish the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. A decade later, most of the major users of palm oil had committed to production the RSPO deemed \u201csustainable\u201d and 19% of global product was certified as such by the organisation. But the Environmental Investigation Agency, an offshoot of Greenpeace, three years ago found RSPO to be \u201cwoefully substandard\u201d and \u201cin some cases \u2026 colluding \u2026 to disguise violations\u201d. (RSPO responded <a href=\"https://www.rspo.org/news-and-events/announcements/rspo-statement-on-the-environmental-investigation-agencys-report\" title=\"\">in a statement</a> that it \u201ctakes very seriously the claims contained in the EIA report, and welcomes it as an opportunity for intensifying this dialogue, and further [improving] its certification system.\u201d)</p> <p>It is extraordinarily difficult to make sure that palm oil is being sustainably produced. A single palm oil mill \u2013 there are hundreds in Malaysia alone \u2013 can buy fruit from a multitude of suppliers, and with all its formulations and derivatives, palm oil has one of the most complicated supply chains of any ingredient. Even when the sustainability certification system is working as it is supposed to, environmentalists have criticised such programmes. For instance, a product can earn a \u201ccertified sustainable\u201d label even if 99% of the palm oil it includes came from freshly deforested land. The RSPO says having less strict certification criteria encourages participation, the hope being that manufacturers of retail products will ramp up to higher levels once they see they can sell certified palm oil for a higher price.</p> <p>Before the European Palm Oil Association meeting, RSPO\u2019s head of European operations, Inke van der Sluijs, admitted that \u201cvery few companies do [the highest level of sustainability certification] because of the complexity and length of the supply chain\u201d. RSPO is widely viewed by environmentalists as the most robust of several certification systems and encourages manufacturers to use RSPO-certified oil. Nevertheless, half of certified-sustainable palm oil isn\u2019t sold as sustainable: until a sufficient number of consumers are willing to pay the higher price for certified palm oil, little will change.</p> <p>Moreover, the vast majority of palm oil is traced only as far as the mill where it\u2019s processed, not to the field where it\u2019s produced. Eyes on the Forest, a coalition of Indonesian NGOs that includes the WWF \u2013 the same organisation that spurred palm oil certification \u2013 said in a 2016 report that \u201cmill traceability [on its own] wastes time and money without offering a solution to the issues of illegal product entering the supply chains\u201d. There is now a growing effort to deploy technology to trace each bunch of fruit to a field and farmer, which would finally ensure new deforestation isn\u2019t occurring to produce palm oil.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/27/its-gods-plan-the-man-who-dreams-of-bringing-intensive-chicken-farming-to-africa\">\u2018It\u2019s God\u2019s plan\u2019: the man who dreams of bringing intensive chicken farming to Africa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The other hope for halting deforestation for palm is increasing yields, the idea being that if more oil can come from existing plantations it will obviate the need to expand the planting area into biodiverse forest. Rajinder Singh, leader of the genomics group at the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, a government agency, has been identifying genetic signatures associated with certain traits so high-yielding palms can be selected and land isn\u2019t wasted on trees that don\u2019t produce much. The best plantations currently yield around six or seven tonnes of oil per hectare, but Singh said, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen individual palms that can give almost double\u201d the amount of oil compared to common strains. As trees reach the end of their productive life of 25-30 years, they could be replaced by more prolific strains.</p> <p>But even doubling yields won\u2019t meet the near-quadrupling of demand expected by 2050. There is no easy solution. Replacing palm with other oils will only accelerate deforestation, since none of its competitors boast anywhere near its yield per unit of land: palm accounts for 6.6% of cultivated land for oils and fats, while delivering 38.7% of the output, according to the European Palm Oil Alliance, an industry group. Colombia is aggressively pursuing palm oil development in areas formerly devoted to illegal crops such as coca, but it has a lot of catching up to match Asia\u2019s output.</p> <p>Palm oil has become ubiquitous because it is the perfect ingredient for a number of growing industries, the perfect export for developing economies, and the perfect commodity for the globalised economy that links them. Wealthy consumers are capitalising on the cheap labour and valuable rainforest that developing nations have in abundance and are willing to part with at a discount to accelerate their economic growth.</p> <p>But that model isn\u2019t sustainable. If things continue, the forests and their creatures will be gone, and the cost of labour will increase as some workers move up the economic ladder and realise there are better things they could be doing than picking fruit. Palm oil producers and consumers will be left with nothing.</p> <p>Products that are sustainable are those produced and consumed locally; when buyers are able to witness the production process, they will demand that it occur in line with their values. When it\u2019s out of sight, it\u2019s difficult to get enough of them to care.

      "bodyText": "Once upon a time in a land far, far away, there grew a magical fruit. This fruit could be squeezed to produce a very special kind of oil that made cookies more healthy, soap more bubbly and crisps more crispy. The oil could even make lipstick smoother and keep ice-cream from melting. Because of these wondrous qualities, people came from around the world to buy the fruit and its oil. In the places where the fruit came from, people burned down the forest so they could plant more trees that grew the fruit \u2013 making lots of nasty smoke and sending all of the creatures of the forest scurrying away. When the trees were burned, they emitted a gas that heated up the air. Then everybody was upset, because they loved the forest\u2019s creatures and thought the temperature was warm enough already. A few people decided they shouldn\u2019t use the oil any more, but mostly things went on as before, and the forest kept burning. This is a true story. Except that it is not magic. The fruit of the oil palm tree (Elaeis guineensis), which grows in tropical climates, contains the world\u2019s most versatile vegetable oil. It can handle frying without spoiling, and blends well with other oils. Its combination of different types of fats and its consistency after refining make it a popular ingredient in packaged baked goods. Its low production costs make it cheaper than frying oils such as cottonseed or sunflower. It provides the foaming agent in virtually every shampoo, liquid soap or detergent. Cosmetics manufacturers prefer it to animal tallow for its ease of application and low price. It is increasingly used as a cheap raw material for biofuels, especially in the European Union. It functions as a natural preservative in processed foods, and actually does raise the melting point of ice-cream. Palm oil can be used as an adhesive that binds together the particles in fibreboard. Oil palm trunks and fronds can be made into everything from plywood to the composite body of Malaysia\u2019s national automobile. Worldwide production of palm oil has been climbing steadily for five decades. Between 1995 and 2015, annual production quadrupled, from 15.2m tonnes to 62.6m tonnes. By 2050, it is expected to quadruple again, reaching 240m tonnes. The footprint of palm oil production is astounding: plantations to produce it account for 10% of permanent global cropland. Today, 3 billion people in 150 countries use products containing palm oil. Globally, we each consume an average of 8kg of palm oil a year. Of this, 85% comes from Malaysia and Indonesia, where worldwide demand for palm oil has lifted incomes, especially in rural areas \u2013 but at the cost of tremendous environmental devastation and often with attendant labour and human rights abuses. Fires set to clear forests and create land for more palm plantations are the top source of greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia, a country of 261 million people. The financial incentive to produce more palm oil is helping to warm the planet, while destroying the only habitat of Sumatran tigers, Sumatran rhinos and orangutans \u2013 driving them towards extinction. Yet consumers are often unaware they are even using the stuff. Palm Oil Investigations, which dubs itself \u201cthe palm oil watchdog\u201d, lists more than 200 common ingredients in food and home and personal care products containing palm oil, only about 10% of which include the telltale word \u201cpalm\u201d. How did palm oil insinuate itself into every corner of our lives? No single innovation caused palm oil consumption to soar. Instead, it was the perfect commodity at the right moment for industry after industry, each of which adopted it to replace ingredients and never turned back. At the same time, producing nations view palm oil as a poverty-reduction scheme, while international finance organisations view it as a growth engine for developing economies. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has pushed Malaysia and Indonesia to produce more. As the palm industry expanded, conservationists and environmental organisations such as Greenpeace started to raise the alarm about its devastating effects on carbon emissions and wildlife habitat. (However, it is not impossible to produce palm oil sustainably, and several organisations certify sustainable producers.) In response, a backlash against palm oil has developed: last April, the supermarket Iceland pledged that it would cut palm oil from all its own-brand foods by the end of 2018. In December, Norway banned imports for biofuel production. But by the time awareness of palm oil\u2019s impact had spread, it was so deeply embedded in the consumer economy that it now may be too late to remove it. (Tellingly, Iceland found it impossible to fulfill its 2018 pledge. Instead, the company ended up removing its branding from foods containing palm oil rather than removing palm oil from all of its branded foods.) Determining which products contain palm oil, let alone how sustainably it has been sourced, requires an almost supernatural level of consumer consciousness. In any case, greater consumer awareness in the west will not have much impact, given that Europe and the US account for less than 14% of global demand. More than half of global demand comes from Asia. It was a good 20 years after the first alarms about deforestation in Brazil that consumer action slowed \u2013 not stopped \u2013 the destruction. With palm oil, \u201cthe reality is that the western part of world is [a small share] of palm oil consumption, and the rest of the world doesn\u2019t give a shit\u201d, said Neil Blomquist, managing director of Colorado-based Natural Habitats, which produces palm oil in Ecuador and Sierra Leone to the highest level of sustainability certification. \u201cSo there\u2019s not much incentive to change.\u201d * * * Palm oil\u2019s world domination is the result of five factors: first, it has replaced less healthy fats in foods in the west. Second, producers have pushed to keep its price low. Third, it has replaced more expensive oils in home and personal care products. Fourth, again because it is cheap, it has been widely adopted as cooking oil in Asian countries. Finally, as those Asian countries have grown richer, they have begun to consume more fat, much of it in the form of palm oil. Widespread adoption of palm oil began with processed foods. In the 1960s, scientists began to warn that butter\u2019s high saturated fat content may increase the risk of heart disease. Food manufacturers, including the British-Dutch conglomerate Unilever, began to replace it with margarine, made with vegetable oils low in saturated fat. By the early 1990s, though, it became clear that the process by which the oils in margarine were made, known as partial hydrogenation, actually created a different kind of fat \u2013 trans fat \u2013 that was even unhealthier than saturated fat. The Unilever board of directors saw a scientific consensus forming against trans fat and decided to get rid of it. \u201cUnilever was always very conscious of the health interests of consumers of its products,\u201d said James W Kinnear, a Unilever board member at the time. The switchover happened suddenly. In 1994, a Unilever refineries manager named Gerrit van Duijn received a call from his bosses in Rotterdam. Twenty Unilever plants in 15 countries needed to remove partially hydrogenated oils from 600 fat blends and replace them with trans-fat free components. The project, for reasons Van Duijn can\u2019t explain, was called \u201cPaddington\u201d. First, he needed to figure out what could replace trans fat while maintaining its favourable properties, such as remaining solid at room temperature \u2013 a necessity for inexpensive butter substitutes as well as manufactured goods such as cookies. In the end, there was only one choice: oil from the oil palm tree \u2013 either palm oil (extracted from the fruit) or palm kernel oil (from the seed). No other oil could be refined to the consistency needed for Unilever\u2019s various margarine blends and baked goods without producing trans fat. It was the only alternative to partially hydrogenated oils, Van Duijn told me. Palm oil and palm kernel oil were also lower in saturated fat than butter. The switch at each plant had to occur simultaneously \u2013 the production lines couldn\u2019t handle a mixture of the old oils and the new. \u201cOn a certain day, all these tanks had to be emptied of trans-containing components and refilled with trans-free components,\u201d Van Duijn said. \u201cLogistically, that was quite a nightmare.\u201d (Purchasing additional tanks would have been too expensive.) As Unilever had sometimes used palm oil previously, a supply chain was already up and running. But it took six weeks for the raw material to be shipped from Malaysia to Europe, and Van Duijn had three months to make the switch. He started to buy more and more palm and palm kernel oils, arranging for the shipments to be trucked in to the various plants on schedule. Then one day in 1995, with trucks queued up outside Unilever plants across Europe, it was done. It was a moment that changed the processed food industry forever. Unilever was the trailblazer; after Van Duijn organised the company\u2019s switch to palm oil, virtually every other food manufacturer followed. In 2001, the American Heart Association issued a statement declaring that \u201cthe optimal diet for reducing risk of chronic diseases is one in which saturated fatty acids are reduced and trans fatty acids from manufactured fats are virtually eliminated\u201d. Today, more than two-thirds of palm oil goes into food. Consumption in the EU more than tripled between Project Paddington and 2015. That same year, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave food manufacturers three years to get rid of all trans fats from every margarine, cookie, cake, pie, popcorn, frozen pizza, doughnut and biscuit sold in the US. Virtually all of it has now been replaced with palm oil. * * * For all the palm oil that now goes into food in Europe and the US, Asia uses far more: India, China, and Indonesia account for nearly 40% of all palm oil consumed worldwide. Where they once cooked with soya oil, palm oil has replaced it. Growth has been fastest in India, where an accelerating economy has been another factor in palm oil\u2019s newfound popularity. One of the commonalities of economic development, across the globe and throughout history, is that a population\u2019s consumption of fat grows in lockstep with its income, and the subcontinent has been no exception. Between 1993 and 2013, Indian per capita GDP expanded from $298 to $1,452. Over the same period, fat consumption in rural areas grew by 35% and in urban areas by 25%, and palm oil has been a major ingredient in this escalation. Government-subsidised \u201cfair price shops\u201d, a food distribution network for the poor, started selling imported palm oil in 1978, mainly for cooking; two years later the 290,000 shops were unloading 273,500 tonnes. By 1995, Indian imports of palm oil had climbed to nearly 1m tonnes, reaching more than 9m tonnes by 2015. In those years, the poverty rate fell by half while the population climbed by 36%. But palm oil is no longer just used for home cooking in India \u2013 today it is a big part of the country\u2019s growing junk food industry. India\u2019s fast food market grew 83% just between 2011 and 2016. Between them, Domino\u2019s Pizza, Subway, Pizza Hut, KFC, McDonald\u2019s and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts \u2013 all of which use palm oil \u2013 now have 2,784 stores in the country, according to reporting by the Nation. Packaged-food sales spiked 138% over roughly the same period; for pennies, you can buy dozens of packaged snacks containing palm oil. Palm oil\u2019s versatility is not limited to food. Unlike other oils, it can be easily and inexpensively \u201cfractionated\u201d \u2013 separated into oils of different consistencies \u2013 which disposes it to multiple uses. \u201cIt has a tremendous advantage because of its versatility,\u201d said Carl Bek-Nielsen, chief executive director of United Plantations Berhad, a Malaysia-based palm oil producer. Not long after the processed food business discovered the magical properties of palm oil, industries as diverse as personal care products and transport fuel would also begin using it to replace other oils. But just as trans fats were chosen for perceived benefits, only to turn out to be worse than what they had replaced, palm oil was initially adopted in large part for its perceived environmental friendliness. As palm oil became more widely used in food the world over, it was also replacing animal products in cleaning products and personal care items such as soap, shampoo, lotion and makeup. Today, 70% of personal care items contain one or more palm oil derivatives. Historically, soap often came from animal tallow, and shampoo, which originated on the Indian subcontinent, was first made with plant-based surfactants (a substance that acts as a detergent, emulsifier or foaming agent). Later, synthetic ingredients came into favour, with animal tallow joining them in the 20th century. In the 1980s, the personal care industry started to notice a consumer preference for \u201cnatural\u201d ingredients, which \u201ca lot of consumers figured was synonymous with plant-based rather than animal-based\u201d, said Chris Sayner, vice-president for corporate sustainability at Croda, a chemical company. Croda\u2019s customers started asking if it could come up with plant-based surfactant formulations without tallow. Just as Van Duijn had discovered at Unilever, the composition of palm oil and palm kernel oil made them the perfect substitute. Manufacturers looking for alternatives found that palm and palm kernel oils contain the same set of fat types as tallow. No other alternative could provide the same advantages across such a wide range of products. \u201cAlternate sources [to tallow] were looked at,\u201d Sayner recalled. \u201cPalm and palm kernel oil dropped in as the replacement.\u201d Sayner believes that the BSE outbreak of the early 1990s, when a brain disease among cattle spread to some people who ate beef, triggered a larger shift in consumption habits. \u201cPublic opinion, brand equity and marketing all came together to move away from animal-based products in more fashion-oriented industries like personal care.\u201d Companies across Europe and the US that Croda supplied started to make the switch. The change from animal-based fats to palm oil came with a certain irony. In the past, when tallow was used in products such as soaps, a byproduct of the meat industry \u2013 animal fat \u2013 was put to good use. Now, in response to consumers\u2019 desire for ingredients perceived as more \u201cnatural,\u201d the makers of soaps, detergents and cosmetics have replaced a local waste product with one that must be transported thousands of miles and that causes environmental destruction in the countries where it is produced. (Although, of course, the meat industry comes with its own environmental harm.) \u201cWhat\u2019s better environmentally than using a byproduct that exists on your doorstep?\u201d Sayner asked. A similar thing happened with biofuels \u2013 the intent to reduce environmental harm had unintended consequences. In 1997, a European commission report called for increasing the percentage of total energy consumption from renewable sources. Three years later it cited the environmental benefits of biofuels for transport, and in 2009 adopted the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), which included a 10% target for the share of transport fuels coming from biofuels by 2020. Unlike in food and home and personal care products, where palm\u2019s chemical makeup makes it the perfect alternative, when it comes to biofuel, palm, soybean, rapeseed and sunflower oils all perform equally well. But palm has one big advantage over these rival oils: price. The EU policies \u201ccreated an unprecedented market for the uptake of palm oil,\u201d said Kalyana Sundram, CEO of the Malaysian Palm Oil Council, a trade group. Legislative attempts in the west to curb the environmental harm of fossil fuels \u2013 the US adopted its own biofuel mandate in 2007 \u2013 had severe environmental consequences in less developed countries, contributing significantly to global warming. EU palm oil imports shot up 15% the year after the RED, reaching an all-time high, and 19% the year after that, as biofuel use tripled in the EU between 2011 and 2014; palm oil\u2019s share of biofuel raw material leapt fivefold in that period. Half of the EU\u2019s palm oil now goes to biofuel, double the share prior to the RED. Sustainability criteria were later added \u2013 although Oxfam and others have criticised their effectiveness \u2013 and earlier this month European commissioners proposed new limits on biofuel crops tied to deforestation. But the damage had already been done. * * * The oil palm is blessed with many attributes that have helped it on its path to dominance. It is perennial and evergreen, enabling year-round production. It is exceptionally efficient at photosynthesis for a perennial tree, and requires less preparation of the soil than other sources of vegetable oils, reducing costs. It can succeed in soils that can\u2019t sustain other crops. Most importantly, it gives the highest yield per acre of any oilseed crop \u2013 almost five times as much oil per acre as rapeseed, almost six times as much as sunflower and more than eight times as much as soybeans. Boycotts of palm oil will only lead to its replacement by other crops needing far more farmland and likely more deforestation. \u201cThe cost of production is far less than any compared [comparable] vegetable or animal fat,\u201d said Sundram, of the Malaysian Palm Oil Council. \u201cIndustry is simply palming off the benefits to the consumer.\u201d For decades, palm\u2019s production advantage went unrealised, until a Scot named Leslie Davidson instigated perhaps the most significant innovation in the industry\u2019s history. Davidson had come to British Malaya in 1951 at the age of 20 to work on a Unilever plantation. Four years later, the company transferred him to Cameroon. The oil palm originated in west Africa, and had been introduced from there to Malaysia in 1875. In Cameroon, Davidson noticed that insects resembling rice weevils surrounded palm fruits. In Malaya, the plantations were employing hundreds of people to hand-pollinate the flowers, yet pollination occurred more efficiently in Cameroon. When Unilever sent Davidson back to Malaya (now Malaysia) in 1960, he told his bosses he thought the Malaysian industry was going about pollination all wrong, and that insects were the natural pollinators of oil palm. \u201cThey told him to mind your own business and don\u2019t get involved,\u201d said Carl Bek-Nielsen, who knew Davidson. In 1974, Davidson became vice-chair of Unilever International Plantations Group. He recruited three entomologists, led by the Pakistani scientist Rahman Syed, who travelled to Cameroon to investigate. Eventually Syed determined that Davidson\u2019s hunch was correct: a particular species of weevil was pollinating the oil palm trees, and Davidson received permission from the Malaysian government to import some. On 21 February, 1981, 2,000 Elaeidobius kamerunicus were released at Unilever\u2019s Mamor estate in Johor. Results were seen immediately, with no adverse effects, and the pollinating weevils were distributed across Malaysia. The following year, the country saw an increase in yield of 400,000 tonnes of palm oil and 300,000 tonnes of palm kernels. The new pollination technique was a key factor in palm oil\u2019s growth. As yields climbed, and the cost of labour to manually pollinate the trees was more efficiently deployed for picking the fruit, there was an explosion in the volume of land devoted to oil-palm plantations. Davidson had radically changed the future of Malaysia and Indonesia. But the changes wouldn\u2019t have occurred without pushes from policymakers in both countries. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of effort from both governments into supporting the sector because it\u2019s an easy way to develop the economy,\u201d said Raquel Moreno-Pe\u00f1aranda, research fellow at United Nations University\u2019s Institute of Advanced Studies in Tokyo, who studies agricultural systems and advises governments. Malaysia\u2019s minister of primary industries, Teresa Kok, told the European Palm Oil Conference in Madrid in October: \u201cPalm oil is synonymous with poverty eradication.\u201d Malaysia began its programme to boost palm exports as a means of poverty reduction in 1961, four years after independence from Britain. Rubber had been a key crop, but with prices falling, the government initiated a programme to replace rubber plantations with oil palm. In 1968, Malaysia provided palm oil producers with a series of tax breaks. Industry subsequently invested heavily in milling technology to extract the oil from the fruit. In the early 1970s, fractionation was developed, expanding the applications of palm oil for both food and other uses. More recently, plantation owners have found profitable uses for waste such as empty fruit bunches, palm fronds, palm fruit peels, and palm kernel shells. Mill effluent that was once dumped into nearby streams now produces electricity. These new revenue streams reduce planters\u2019 risk by providing income even when palm oil prices are down (such as right now), and have helped them face headwinds such as the increasing costs of labour and fertiliser. But the push for increased palm oil production has not only come from inside Malaysia and Indonesia. World Bank policies in the 1970s encouraged the Indonesian government to expand palm among small farmers. The 1998 economic crisis in Asia shattered exports of manufactured goods from the region, but commodity exports, which were sold in dollars, \u201ccame in like a life vest in rough choppy seas,\u201d Bek-Nielsen recalled. The IMF\u2019s bailout package for Indonesia required that it generate revenue by cultivating natural resources and erase export taxes the government had imposed to keep prices low at home. The measures further incentivised expansion of palm plantations. Alongside the IMF, private finance has helped boost production: Dutch banks alone provided more than $12bn in loans to Indonesian palm producers in the years 1995-99. * * * The short-term benefits to plantation owners and labourers, producer-nations\u2019 governments and financiers have come with enormous long-term costs to the global climate. Forests destroyed for oil palm plantations are among the most carbon-rich in the world. When they are burned, that carbon is released. Palm oil now accounts for 13.7% of Malaysia\u2019s gross national income and is Indonesia\u2019s top export. In October, at the European Palm Oil Association meeting in Madrid, government officials from the two countries trumpeted the successes in poverty reduction they had achieved thanks to palm oil (though growers in Indonesia, at least, have disputed these claims, calling on government and industry to do more for farmers independent of the big plantations). Officials further insisted that deforestation was being halted and sustainability achieved, even as another speaker told the attendees deforestation had actually increased in some areas over the previous decade. (In September, Indonesia\u2019s president signed a three-year moratorium on new palm-plantation development.) Commodity-producing countries need only answer to their buyers, though, while those buyers must respond to consumers. In 2004, the environmental NGO Friends of the Earth UK released a report detailing deforestation rates from palm-oil production. As the outcry spread, and concern rose among producers that the continued deforestation would become a risk to their reputations, the World Wildlife Federation that year convinced a small number of palm growers, manufacturers and retailers to establish the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. A decade later, most of the major users of palm oil had committed to production the RSPO deemed \u201csustainable\u201d and 19% of global product was certified as such by the organisation. But the Environmental Investigation Agency, an offshoot of Greenpeace, three years ago found RSPO to be \u201cwoefully substandard\u201d and \u201cin some cases \u2026 colluding \u2026 to disguise violations\u201d. (RSPO responded in a statement that it \u201ctakes very seriously the claims contained in the EIA report, and welcomes it as an opportunity for intensifying this dialogue, and further [improving] its certification system.\u201d) It is extraordinarily difficult to make sure that palm oil is being sustainably produced. A single palm oil mill \u2013 there are hundreds in Malaysia alone \u2013 can buy fruit from a multitude of suppliers, and with all its formulations and derivatives, palm oil has one of the most complicated supply chains of any ingredient. Even when the sustainability certification system is working as it is supposed to, environmentalists have criticised such programmes. For instance, a product can earn a \u201ccertified sustainable\u201d label even if 99% of the palm oil it includes came from freshly deforested land. The RSPO says having less strict certification criteria encourages participation, the hope being that manufacturers of retail products will ramp up to higher levels once they see they can sell certified palm oil for a higher price. Before the European Palm Oil Association meeting, RSPO\u2019s head of European operations, Inke van der Sluijs, admitted that \u201cvery few companies do [the highest level of sustainability certification] because of the complexity and length of the supply chain\u201d. RSPO is widely viewed by environmentalists as the most robust of several certification systems and encourages manufacturers to use RSPO-certified oil. Nevertheless, half of certified-sustainable palm oil isn\u2019t sold as sustainable: until a sufficient number of consumers are willing to pay the higher price for certified palm oil, little will change. Moreover, the vast majority of palm oil is traced only as far as the mill where it\u2019s processed, not to the field where it\u2019s produced. Eyes on the Forest, a coalition of Indonesian NGOs that includes the WWF \u2013 the same organisation that spurred palm oil certification \u2013 said in a 2016 report that \u201cmill traceability [on its own] wastes time and money without offering a solution to the issues of illegal product entering the supply chains\u201d. There is now a growing effort to deploy technology to trace each bunch of fruit to a field and farmer, which would finally ensure new deforestation isn\u2019t occurring to produce palm oil. The other hope for halting deforestation for palm is increasing yields, the idea being that if more oil can come from existing plantations it will obviate the need to expand the planting area into biodiverse forest. Rajinder Singh, leader of the genomics group at the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, a government agency, has been identifying genetic signatures associated with certain traits so high-yielding palms can be selected and land isn\u2019t wasted on trees that don\u2019t produce much. The best plantations currently yield around six or seven tonnes of oil per hectare, but Singh said, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen individual palms that can give almost double\u201d the amount of oil compared to common strains. As trees reach the end of their productive life of 25-30 years, they could be replaced by more prolific strains. But even doubling yields won\u2019t meet the near-quadrupling of demand expected by 2050. There is no easy solution. Replacing palm with other oils will only accelerate deforestation, since none of its competitors boast anywhere near its yield per unit of land: palm accounts for 6.6% of cultivated land for oils and fats, while delivering 38.7% of the output, according to the European Palm Oil Alliance, an industry group. Colombia is aggressively pursuing palm oil development in areas formerly devoted to illegal crops such as coca, but it has a lot of catching up to match Asia\u2019s output. Palm oil has become ubiquitous because it is the perfect ingredient for a number of growing industries, the perfect export for developing economies, and the perfect commodity for the globalised economy that links them. Wealthy consumers are capitalising on the cheap labour and valuable rainforest that developing nations have in abundance and are willing to part with at a discount to accelerate their economic growth. But that model isn\u2019t sustainable. If things continue, the forests and their creatures will be gone, and the cost of labour will increase as some workers move up the economic ladder and realise there are better things they could be doing than picking fruit. Palm oil producers and consumers will be left with nothing. Products that are sustainable are those produced and consumed locally; when buyers are able to witness the production process, they will demand that it occur in line with their values. When it\u2019s out of sight, it\u2019s difficult to get enough of them to care. Changing that may require more than a little magic. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here. \u2022 This piece has been edited to correct the attribution of a report, to \u201cEyes on the Forest, a coalition of Indonesian NGOs that includes the WWF\u201d, rather than to the WWF alone.",

Each year 430,000 tonnes of clothing are disposed of and not recycled in the UK.

Her job was to order the trims: labels, hanging loops, buttons, zips. The quantity of delivered fabric always varied, so she had to order a surfeit of trims, a routine waste that made her uncomfortable. She had always loved sewing, selling her handmade clothes on market stalls and Etsy. Now, her two ways of living jarred.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be part of fast fashion any more,\u201d she says. She quit her job, sewed clothes, sold the clothes, taught sewing and blogged about it. In the past 11 years, Edwards has bought only \u201cone or two things\u201d. Her bras are new, and she thinks she may have purchased a top from Zara in about 2010. Even her knickers are what she calls \u201cme-made\u201d.</p> <p>So how difficult is it to stop buying clothes? Tania Arrayales, a self-described \u201cfashion disruptor\u201d, has founded an organisation in New York called <a href=\"https://fashionoftomorrow.org/\" title=\"\">Fashion of Tomorrow</a> to advocate a more sustainable approach to the clothing industry. Arrayales was a founding member of <a href=\"https://www.stylelend.com/\" title=\"\">Style Lend</a>, a peer-to-peer clothing rental site, and swore off all clothing purchases for a year, inspired by the documentary <a href=\"https://truecostmovie.com/\" title=\"\">True Cost</a>. But weren\u2019t there times when she was desperate to break her self-imposed rule?</p> <p>\u201cThe challenge was feeling a little bit \u2026 I wasn\u2019t as trendy as I used to be. I couldn\u2019t make an impact when I went to an event,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anything new and shiny. But I wanted to restructure the way my brain saw shopping.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ccd6040e614994df8178042528825a8be92d321b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccd6040e614994df8178042528825a8be92d321b/0_343_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cI started seeing pieces in a new light\u2019: Tania Arrayales, a founding member of the clothing rental site Style Lend.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I started seeing pieces in a new light\u2019: Tania Arrayales, a founding member of the clothing rental site Style Lend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tania Arrayles</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In her second year, she allowed herself to buy vintage clothes. The year after that, she bought the odd piece of new clothing from sustainable brands. Any time she felt her style \u201clack a little\u201d, she rented what she needed from Style Lend (there are lending sites in the UK, too, but this is not yet a flourishing market). \u201cI started seeing pieces in a new light. I discovered styling,\u201d Arrayales says.</p> <p>Cowdery has noticed a similar sense of exploration and play at the Clothes Exchange. \u201cI\u2019ve been more experimental, more free, with clothes. I don\u2019t keep things for best. I wear them. And I don\u2019t worry about the size on the label,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The fluidity around sizing is one of the pleasures of secondhand shopping. Depop sellers such as Fewell list clothes as fitting size eight to 14. Shoppers are encouraged to view their size as variable. \u201cThat\u2019s the great thing about swapping,\u201d Cowdery says. No one gets depressed because something their size won\u2019t zip up. \u201cYou just look by eye, and ask yourself: \u2018Will that fit?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Edwards has faced a similar confrontation with her personal taste. Sewing requires a lot of decision-making: the colour and weight of fabric, length of dress, shape of sleeves. She buys vintage fabric and refashions charity shop finds, but even so, she doesn\u2019t think \u201csewing is necessarily the most sustainable way to dress yourself\u201d. There is still the acquisition of fabric and materials. And a tendency to prize the making over the wearing, so that a lot of making goes on that never gets worn. \u201cThere is a big slow fashion movement within the sewing community,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cPeople are using their stash rather than buying new stuff.\u201d</p> <p>The volume of clothing of all kinds \u2013 new, secondhand and handmade \u2013 is challenging. And selling on secondhand clothes has its limits. To avoid swamping the secondhand market, or passing the problem on to others, including developing countries where many used clothes are sold in bulk, other technologies, such as <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/review-commercial-textile-fibre-recycling-technologies\" title=\"\">fibre-to-fibre recycling</a>, need to be encouraged.</p> <p>\u201cClothing is a way to show who I am, what I feel, what I believe,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to communicate with the world. It\u2019s got real social value, but it has got to be done mindfully.\u201d</p> <p>So what can a person who loves new clothes but wants to live more sustainably do? As Edwards says, if you are spending time on fashion sites, it doesn\u2019t take a huge leap of imagination or will to switch your browser to eBay, Depop, <a href=\"https://www.thredup.com/p/about\" title=\"\">thredUP</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hardlyeverwornit.com/\">HEWI London</a> or any of the raft of \u201cresale disruptors\u201d. Chenoweth says that \u201cnot keeping stuff in your wardrobe is important if you\u2019re not wearing it\u201d. Donating clothes puts them back into circulation.</p> <p>As Cowdery says: \u201cClothes have a story. If you wear something once then throw it in the bin, it hasn\u2019t had a story. You want to know there\u2019s life in these things.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 February 2019. An earlier version referred to Newbury as Newberry.

      "bodyText": "Lauren Cowdery is flicking through the rails of the Cancer Research charity shop in Goole, east Yorkshire. \u201cToo bobbly!\u201d she tuts at a ribbed top. \u201cThis skirt is big but it would be easy to take in \u2026 \u201d Cowdery appears to be shopping, but she is merely browsing. She is on a mission not to buy any new clothes, even ones that have recently belonged to someone else. \u201cI think you have to pull back and ask: \u2018Do I need this?\u2019\u201d she says. Cowdery is one of a growing number of people who love clothes but try their hardest to resist buying them for reasons of sustainability. According to the charity Wrap, which promotes sustainable waste management, the average lifetime for a garment in the UK is just 2.2 years. An estimated \u00a330bn of unused clothing hangs in UK wardrobes, and yet still we shop for more. \u201cEach week we buy 38m items and 11m items go to landfill,\u201d says Maria Chenoweth, chief executive of Traid, a charity working to stop clothes being thrown away. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough resources to keep feeding this monster.\u201d Chenoweth believes that consumers are switching to secondhand shopping, or adding a pre-owned element into their purchasing habits. She points to a 30% rise in turnover at Traid shops in 2018 compared with 2017. When she was a teenager in the 80s, her father banned her from jumble sales in case people thought the family was poor. She disobeyed him, and dragged her sacks of clothes through her bedroom window. Now, Chenoweth considers it \u201ca huge gesture of activism to buy secondhand\u201d, a necessary choice for those who \u201cdo not believe in damaging the environment and perpetuating this consumption and waste\u201d. So how hard is it to make the transition to a more sustainable way of shopping? In the UK, clothing has the fourth largest environmental impact after housing, transport and food. More than half of fast-fashion items are thrown away in less than a year, according to McKinsey\u2019s State of Fashion report last year. But is buying secondhand really an antidote to fast fashion? In Goole, where Cowdery works as a marketing officer for the Junction Theatre, there are ample local distractions for a lunch break: Dorothy Perkins, New Look, Peacocks. Cowdery used to buy things \u201cbecause they were there\u201d. In the evenings, she went on Asos. \u201cI\u2019d think: \u2018Oh brilliant, a discount code! Free shipping! I\u2019ll order stuff! Hmm \u2026 It doesn\u2019t fit very well, but I can\u2019t be bothered to send it back \u2026 I\u2019ll keep it.\u2019\u201d Each month, Cowdery bought two or three things. \u201cAt \u00a320 a time, that starts to build up. There\u2019s a wardrobe of stuff. Things with the tags still on \u2026 I took a look at myself and thought: \u2018What are you doing?\u2019\u201d Curious about a post she saw on Facebook, one weekend Cowdery dropped into the Leeds Community Clothes Exchange, a local swap shop. Four years on, she is one of its three directors, helping to oversee the 2,000 items \u2013 \u201cdesigner stuff, vintage stuff, handmade things, wedding dresses\u201d \u2013 that pass through the doors of the Woodhouse community centre each month. Cowdery and I meet in one of those lunch hours that used to be spent shopping. Her skirt, top and cardigan are all from the Clothes Exchange; her boots are from the Autism Plus shop in Goole. \u201cAt the exchange, it\u2019s one for one on everything,\u201d she explains. There are no value judgments. A garment is saleable if all its buttons are present and there are no stains. Some prom dresses return again and again. \u201cPeople take them, wear them, bring them back.\u201d Regulars set aside pieces for each other. The fitting room is a place of encouragement. As her involvement in the clothes exchange grew, Cowdery\u2019s visits to Peacocks dwindled. Now, its shop floor struck her as \u201can explosion in a jumble sale\u201d. She began to delete unopened emails from Asos and Topshop. She swore off buying new clothes for a year. \u201cI thought I\u2019d reach the end and think: \u2018I\u2019ve done that. I\u2019ll move on,\u2019\u201d she says. Instead, \u201cIt changed how I thought about clothes.\u201d Cowdery still loves clothes \u2013 especially anything velvet \u2013 but she has found a safe way to consume them. The clothes exchange enables her to refresh her wardrobe without adding to it. She can be acquisitive, as long as she relinquishes in equal measure. Where she once bought three pieces a month, she now swaps 10 to 15 \u2013 mostly things she picked up at the previous exchange. Clothes come and go at the Basingstoke home of Sarah Fewell, too. In fact, so many parcels come and go that she knows her postman by his first name (Jay). Fewell has always loved cutting up old clothes, sticking on studs, even at 14 when most of her friends were into Hollister. But now she has turned her passion for preloved clothes into a sustainable version of fast fashion. Fewell runs a shop called Identity Party on the website Depop, which since being established in 2011 has offered its 10 million users a blend of eBay-style trading with Instagram-style posting. Her brand is \u201ca lot of 80s, 90s, quite bohemian, grungy\u201d. She especially loves \u201cselling things with animals on, a good old ugly jumper and anything by St Michael.\u201d Two years ago, in the second year of a politics degree at Goldsmiths, University of London, Fewell was browsing the charity shops when she saw \u201ca really nice dress that wasn\u2019t for me\u201d.

She bought and sold relentlessly during her third year. \u201cWhen I left university, I thought, I don\u2019t want a real job.\u201d Now with Identity Party, Fewell has professionalised her love of vintage. She doesn\u2019t totally eschew new clothes for her own wardobe; they make up about 10%. She buys gymwear new, for instance (\u201cIt would be a bit gross to wear secondhand gym clothes\u201d). She even bought some on Black Friday: \u201cThat\u2019s maybe contradictory of me to engage in Black Friday, but I just wanted gym clothes.\u201d We are sitting in a cafe in a shopping mall in Basingstoke.

To avoid swamping the secondhand market, or passing the problem on to others, including developing countries where many used clothes are sold in bulk, other technologies, such as fibre-to-fibre recycling, need to be encouraged. \u201cClothing is a way to show who I am, what I feel, what I believe,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to communicate with the world. It\u2019s got real social value, but it has got to be done mindfully.\u201d So what can a person who loves new clothes but wants to live more sustainably do? As Edwards says, if you are spending time on fashion sites, it doesn\u2019t take a huge leap of imagination or will to switch your browser to eBay, Depop, thredUP, HEWI London or any of the raft of \u201cresale disruptors\u201d. Chenoweth says that \u201cnot keeping stuff in your wardrobe is important if you\u2019re not wearing it\u201d. Donating clothes puts them back into circulation. As Cowdery says: \u201cClothes have a story. If you wear something once then throw it in the bin, it hasn\u2019t had a story. You want to know there\u2019s life in these things.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 19 February 2019. An earlier version referred to Newbury as Newberry. This has been corrected.",

Among those that have set climate goals, only one in three stretch beyond 2025, according to the annual Carbon Disclosure Project report. Instead, corporate action has focused in the boardroom, with 47% of firms rewarding their CEOs for climate performance, and a quarter tying incentives to environmental goals. European firms now make up half of the CDP\u2019s environmental \u201cA-list\u201d and the managing director for Europe, Steven Tebbe, praised climate disclosure\u2019s entry into the financial mainstream. \u201cThe next decade is vital if our shift to a sustainable economy is to be successful, and companies lie at the heart of this transition,\u201d he said. A-list companies on the Stoxx global climate change leaders index outperformed their peers by 5.5% per annum this decade, he noted. Although 53% of companies surveyed did not yet have climate goals, 58% reported carbon cuts in 2018, amounting to a total reduction of the equivalent of 85m tonnes of CO2 \u2013 as much as Austria\u2019s annual emissions. One third of companies reported increased emissions. One A-listed property management firm, Landsec, has cut its greenhouse gases by 17% since 2014 \u2013 on the way to a planned 40% tail-off by 2030. Caroline Hill, Landsec\u2019s head of sustainability, said: \u201cWe set what was the first science-based carbon reduction target in real estate, based on what was needed in our sector to to ensure the world keeps within 1.5 to 2C of global warming.\u201d She said the company drove down energy consumption in London offices and suburban retail parks by upgrading to LED lighting and systematically installing rooftop solar panels. This year, CDP received climate disclosures from 849 European companies in 23 countries, with combined emissions of around 2.3bn tonnes of CO2 \u2013 a total greater than the UK, Germany and France combined.

A year after its foundation, it packed Madrid\u2019s Puerta del Sol square with supporters as Iglesias told the crowd to challenge the monsters of \u201cfinancial totalitarianism\u201d and \u201ctake their dreams seriously\u201d. That was four years ago, when the damage caused by the global financial crash and a burst construction bubble at home was rawer than it is now. In December, a Podemos-led coalition lost a third of its votes in regional elections in southern Andalucia. Instead of asking Podemos to take over the traditionally leftwing regional government, voters in one of Spain\u2019s poorest regions ushered in a rightwing government backed by Vox. When that happens, something has gone badly wrong with the \u201cPodemos revolution\u201d. \u2022 Giles Tremlett is a journalist and author based in Madrid",

After being personally chauffeured from the airport by the country\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, Prince Mohammed signed agreements worth $20bn on Monday, a crucial injection of funds for an ailing economy suffering a foreign-currency crunch and which is currently negotiating its 13th IMF bailout in 40 years. The day was declared a public holiday in Pakistan, and pictures of the powerful royal dotted the capital Islamabad. In celebration, the Saudis announced the release of more than 2,000 Pakistani prisoners from their jails. With trips to US and European capitals unlikely in the near future, the royal visits to Pakistan, India and China this week are an important opportunity for the crown prince to prove he is still an acceptable statesman in the wake of the murder of Khashoggi, a dissident Saudi journalist. Analysts have said the tour is part of a Gulf pivot to rising Asia as a growing oil market, but also a timely demonstration to the west that Prince Mohammed is not an international pariah. Crucially, India, Pakistan and China have all been silent on Khashoggi\u2019s killing. \u201cThese visits [are] an attempt to portray to his subjects that it is business as usual for the royal family,\u201d Rodger Shanahan, a fellow at the Sydney-based Lowy Institute who specialises in Middle Eastern politics, said. After Pakistan, the crown prince arrived in Delhi on Tuesday evening, where he was welcomed at the airport by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who embraced him in a characteristic bear hug. The royal visit had briefly appeared in doubt last week after a Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) used a car laden with explosives to bomb a convoy of Indian paramilitaries in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir. Prince Mohammed pressed ahead but will have to walk a diplomatic tightrope in Delhi, which has blamed Pakistan for the bombing and sworn revenge. A joint statement issued in Islamabad on Monday said both Saudi Arabia and Pakistan \u201cunderlined the need for avoiding politicisation of UN listing regime\u201d \u2013 a significant concession to Islamabad, which has fought efforts to have JeM chief Masood Azhar formally added to a UN terrorist watchlist. The Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir said on Monday his country would try to de-escalate tensions between south Asia\u2019s nuclear-armed neighbours. The car bombing, the deadliest attack in the history of Kashmir\u2019s 30-year insurgency, provides an unwelcome opportunity for controversy on a crucial tour for the man slated as Saudi Arabia\u2019s future king. The murder of the journalist Khashoggi in Istanbul in October \u2013 which US intelligence has concluded was probably ordered by the crown prince \u2013 has severely tarnished his attempted makeover as a moderniser of the austere kingdom. It has also raised doubts over his capacity to assume the Saudi throne, emphasising the need to show he can still command important audiences abroad. \u201cStatus is important within the royal families of the Middle East, and a measure of status is how they are viewed throughout the world,\u201d said Shanahan. Prince Mohammed made his first state visit overseas since the murder to north Africa in December, where was warmly met in Egypt but dogged in Tunisia by protesters wielding saws \u2013 a reference to Khashoggi\u2019s alleged dismemberment. The king of Morocco declined to meet with him.",

But environment groups have called for the federal government to reject the development, arguing the deepwater project would put pristine coastline and marine life at risk. Equinor is not required to make its draft environment plan public before submitting it to the regulator, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema). But it has published the documents as part of a bid to create more transparency around the project and is taking public comment for 30 days, through Nopsema. \u201cOver the last two years we have engaged with more than 100 different organisations in the South Australian community and they have consistently asked us to be open about our plans,\u201d said Jone Stangeland, Equinor\u2019s Australian manager. \u201cThis draft EP is the result of more than two years of careful preparation and our 1500-page plan demonstrates how we can drill safely and includes a robust emergency response plan.\u201d The company\u2019s proposed Stromlo-1 well would be located 372km off the coast of South Australia and 476km west of Port Lincoln. The draft plan sets out the company\u2019s response to risks associated with the project, including the possibility of a major spill. A map, produced from an amalgamation of 100 oil spill simulations, shows the potential for spills to hit coastline and ocean anywhere from Esperance in Western Australia, to areas around Sydney and the NSW coast, to Victoria and Tasmania. The company says in its plan it had addressed concerns about the time it would take to install a capping stack in the event of a well blowout. \u201cSince the development of an earlier plan submitted to Nopsema, where it would have taken 35 days to install the capping stack, we have developed a plan that more than halves the deployment time to 15 days,\u201d the draft plan states.

      "bodyText": "Asylum seekers on Manus Island say the security contractor Paladin is \u201cdoing nothing\u201d on the ground, questioning how the firm is spending money from its $423m deal with the Australian government. The Australian government is continuing to face scrutiny for its decision to hand the contracts to run the Manus Island asylum and refugee centres to the contractor Paladin, through a non-competitive tender process. Paladin had little experience in providing garrison and security services in immigration detention, but the home affairs department has said it was left with little choice but to hand it the contract because others were reluctant to be associated with the \u201cnoise\u201d of its offshore detention regime. Asylum seekers on Manus Island said they had long questioned what the Australian government was paying for, not just through its deal with Paladin, but with all its contractors. The award-winning journalist and writer Behrouz Boochani, who is on Manus, said there were many locals working at the centre on low wages. He said Paladin\u2019s staff did little more than check IDs and sit in camps by the front gate. Security incidents were typically dealt with by police, he said. \u201cWhat I am seeing on the ground is that Paladin, they ... are doing nothing,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cIn Australia, people ask this question now. But this question for us is for years, not only for Paladin, but all of the companies. How do they spend this money? It is a question for us, not only Paladin, [but for health contractors] IHMS, PIH. \u201cAll the companies they are doing nothing. Services they are not giving us.\u201d Reports have suggested Papua New Guinea\u2019s parliamentary speaker and MP for Manus, Job Pomat, benefited from the deal through a family company \u2013 Peren Investment \u2013 which entered into an agreement with Paladin Solutions PNG for the provision of certain services. But Pomat told Guardian Australia he had nothing to hide. Pomat said he was inviting all journalists to go to Manus and see first-hand documents and bank records he would make public regarding the allegations. \u201cCome, I have nothing to hide,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the company dealings because I am not a company director.\u201d He said there was nothing wrong with landowners benefiting from projects on their land. Pomat called on Paladin to come clean on the deal and not bring his name into disrepute over nothing. \u201cI want to call on Paladin to come out clear and tell me what kind of deal did I broker with them and my family members/company or landowner company?\u201d In response, Paladin said it was not in a position to comment on \u201cany matters relating to our work on behalf of the Australian government in Papua New Guinea\u201d. \u201cHowever, I encourage you to direct any further queries to the Department of Home Affairs,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cPaladin\u2019s number one priority and focus as always is to ensure we provide a safe and secure environment for Residents.\u201d Late on Monday, the PNG government said it would raise concerns about Paladin with the Australian government. The immigration minister, Petrus Thomas, said the PNG government had no involvement in awarding the contract. But he confirmed the visa of one of Paladin\u2019s directors had been cancelled for \u201cnot adhering\u201d to the government\u2019s preference for firms to use local labour. \u201cThe award of contract to Paladin was done by the Australian government and PNG has no say,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cHowever, given concerns raised in the media about the directors of the company, the experience and track record of the company, PNG will raise its concerns through the Department of Home Affairs. \u201cI can confirm that the visa of one of the directors of the company was cancelled because of the company not adhering to the government\u2019s position on recruitment of local labour by recruiting security personnel from overseas and not following the process in dealing with visa matters.\u201d The home affairs department has been criticised in the past for its handling of contracts for the offshore detention program.

A similar process occurred when awarding work to another major offshore detention centre contractor, Canstruct, which won a $591m deal to run garrison and welfare services on Nauru. One of Paladin\u2019s subsidiaries until recently listed its business premises as a beach shack on Kangaroo Island. An office in Singapore is registered to a company called Luther Corporate Services. Home affairs officials on Monday said the amount paid to Paladin was comparable to previous contractors. It said had processes in place to satisfy itself that Paladin was fulfilling the requirements of the contract as expected.",

      "bodyText": "Mathias Cormann has revealed he booked private travel on three occasions by ringing up the chief executive of a major travel company run by a Liberal donor and a personal friend, but denies the travel was a gift, or provided to him at a discount. The finance minister faced hours of questioning in Senate estimates after it was reported that flights for a family holiday to Singapore were paid for by a travel company which is the recipient of a major government contract. The company, Helloworld, is controlled by the Liberal party treasurer, Andrew Burnes. Cormann also revealed that Burnes complained to him privately about the conduct of the tender for the travel contract, but the finance minister told the hearing on Tuesday he had not passed those complaints on to bureaucrats, and played no role in determining the successful bidder. He said he played no direct role in procurement as a matter of routine, but said given the \u201ccircumstances\u201d, meaning his personal relationship with Burnes, he was \u201cextremely cautious\u201d in relation to the contract. The secretary of the finance department, Rosemary Huxtable, told the hearing Burnes had also contacted her to raise concerns about a \u201crobust process\u201d in relation to the travel contract, which the company ultimately secured in July 2017, but he did not make an official complaint to the department. She said Cormann had not spoken to her about Burnes\u2019s criticisms. Pressed on the unusual practice of ringing the chief executive of a major travel company to book a family holiday, rather than ringing, as the Labor senator Jenny McAllister suggested, \u201ca 1800 number\u201d, Cormann told the hearing: \u201cI\u2019ve got a close personal relationship with Mr Burnes, and I don\u2019t think that it is unusual to ask somebody who owns a business to sell products and services to you on commercial terms.\u201d Cormann rejected an observation from Labor\u2019s Senate leader, Penny Wong, that it was \u201cnot a great look\u201d when a party donor won a lucrative government contract. The finance minister told the hearing companies should not be excluded from government tenders if their executives \u201cparticipated in the democratic process\u201d \u2013 meaning made political donations \u2013 or had a personal friendship with the portfolio minister, provided probity controls were in place, because otherwise taxpayers might not get value for money. Cormann said Labor had granted the same company a government travel contract. The controversy began when Fairfax Media reported on Tuesday Cormann had not paid for family travel to Singapore booked on 17 July 2017, worth $2,780, until he was alerted to the issue by the newspaper. Cormann said he failed to notice that he hadn\u2019t paid the bill, citing a lot of travel-related activity on his credit card. He said the company had not sent him a \u201creminder notice\u201d. The finance minister issued a statement saying he had \u201cabsolutely no involvement\u201d in awarding the government contract to Helloworld. The Department of Finance awarded the travel contract to the AOT Group, which includes Helloworld, on 28 July 2017. The initial phase of the contract, which runs for a term of up to six years, is worth $21m. Burnes has a substantial political network, and made a number of personal donations to Liberal MPs. The company had donated more than $500,000 to the Liberal party. The finance minister said the holiday booking through Helloworld was made on \u201ccommercial terms and should have been charged to my credit card straight away as instructed by me at the time\u201d. \u201cThat is what I genuinely thought had happened,\u201d Cormann said. \u201cAt no point, until approached by the media [on Monday], did I receive any reminders that the payment due remained outstanding, even though I now understand it appeared as outstanding and unresolved on the internal Helloworld system since that time. \u201cThe payment was processed immediately once it became apparent to me that it remained outstanding.\u201d Cormann also tabled a letter to him from Helloworld\u2019s chief financial officer Michael Burnett characterising the lack of payment as a \u201cregrettable\u201d administrative error. \u201cBecause we held your credit cards at the time of booking, payment reminders were not sent to you, even though the amount remained listed as outstanding on our internal system,\u201d Burnett said. \u201cWe have now processed payment of the full outstanding amount of $2,780.82 from the credit card previously supplied to us. The flights were never free and they were never intended to be free. \u201cWe apologise for any inconvenience or embarrassment this administrative error may have caused.\u201d The prime minister was asked about the travel during a radio interview on Tuesday morning, and said the finance minister was unaware he hadn\u2019t settled the account. \u201cThat is the statement that he has made. \u201cHe had nothing to do with the issuing with the contract, that had been issued prior and ministers are not involved with those decisions, there is a big separation administratively, the suggestion the two are linked would be complete rubbish,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThere was an oversight which has been identified and he has fixed it up \u2013 I mean, what more can he do? He didn\u2019t take free tickets in the first place ... they were going to bill him and he didn\u2019t get billed and that was drawn to his attention, he paid the bill.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The federal environment department does not know if hundreds of rare and endangered Australian birds exported to a German organisation headed by a convicted kidnapper and extortionist are still at the group\u2019s facility in Brandenburg. Department officials told Senate estimates on Monday night their wildlife compliance unit was investigating after Guardian Australia reported the government had been warned birds sent to the Association for the Conservation of Threatened Parrots (ACTP) could be sold to collectors at a huge profit. Officials told the hearing they had received multiple allegations about ACTP\u2019s activities dating back to late 2016. Kylie Jonasson, the first assistant secretary in the department\u2019s biodiversity conservation division, said each time the department received an allegation \u2013 including in July and August 2017 \u2013 it had sought information from the German government and its scientific authority responsible for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. She said each time there had not been enough evidence to confirm the complaints, and there was nothing to prevent the department from continuing to issue permits to exporters sending animals to ACTP. But officials also told the hearing that no department representative had ever visited the organisation\u2019s facility in Brandenburg and that they had not made inquiries as to whether more than 200 birds exported to ACTP since 2015 were still there. Guardian Australia\u2019s investigation found the department had issued permits for 232 birds over three years on the grounds they would be used for exhibition purposes because ACTP was a zoo. But the organisation has no facilities that are freely open to the public, and private messages on social media show native Australian birds apparently from ACTP have been offered for sale for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The German federal agency for nature conservation has said it was aware of those offers. The Labor senator Anne Urqhuart asked the department if it had visited ACTP to satisfy itself the facility was a zoo and the department said it had relied on information from the relevant authorities in Germany. \u201cI would take it then the department hasn\u2019t checked, or you haven\u2019t visited, to check that all of the Australian birds are still there?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo senator, we haven\u2019t visited Germany to the zoo, we\u2019re relying on the information from the German government,\u201d said Paul Murphy, the assistant secretary of the department\u2019s wildlife trade and biosecurity branch. \u201cSo have you asked the German government if all of the Australian birds are still there at the zoo?\u201d Urqhuart asked. \u201cWe haven\u2019t asked that specific question, senator, but certainly our enquiries with the Cites authority have satisfied us that they consider it to be a legitimate zoo that is operating within the German law,\u201d Murphy replied. \u201cBut you don\u2019t know if all the birds are still there?\u201d Urqhuart asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know senator,\u201d Murphy said. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws show that the environment minister, Melissa Price, and the previous minister, Josh Frydenberg, have requested multiple briefings since 2017 from the department about the export of the birds to Germany. In a briefing to Frydenberg\u2019s office in October 2017, the department wrote that \u201cthe number of birds requested by ACTP is unusual for a zoo. Most zoos are open to the public and only hold enough of a species to form a single display group.\u201d The briefing said: \u201cAustralian parrots are popular as pets. Some of the species exported to ACTP are rare in the pet market and would attract high sale prices.\u201d \u201cThe department has directly advised ACTP that offspring of exported specimens cannot be sold. ACTP has stated that the offspring of exported birds will not be sold,\u201d it says. In Monday\u2019s hearing, the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young asked why the department had continued to issue permits. \u201cSo you\u2019ve had consistent allegations raised since 2017 and right up until now and you\u2019ve continued to issue permits. So what is it? Either you\u2019ve made the wrong decision or there\u2019s something wrong with the Act,\u201d she said. Murphy replied: \u201cSenator, they\u2019re allegations. Each case we\u2019ve looked at allegations, we\u2019ve considered what evidence has been put forward and it has not been sufficient to not issue a permit.\u201d The department\u2019s chief compliance officer, Monica Collins, said they were making fresh inquiries after the publication of Guardian\u2019s investigation late last year and \u201cpursuing all intelligence avenues.\u201d \u201cBut you can\u2019t tell us where the 232 birds are, can you?\u201d Hanson-Young said. \u201cWell that\u2019s not the nature of what we\u2019re looking at. What we\u2019re looking at is the allegations that have been made most recently,\u201d Collins said. Comment has been sought from Price and Frydenberg.",

There is one big difference between their passengers and our patients. It partly explains why the aviation industry works more effectively to keep people safe and ours does not. If a pilot is incompetent, or, if they take off in a plane they know is unsafe, they will still be found to be at fault when the plane crashes. Crucially, they are also on board.

Our secret ability to avoid much iatrogenic harm might weaken the incentive to fix these issues.</p> <p>Take the most recent evolving scandal in my field of obstetrics and gynaecology. It happened in Australia, but it could easily have happened anywhere. Questions are now being asked how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/09/authorities-knew-disgraced-surgeon-emil-gayed-had-harmed-women-over-decades\">Emil Shawky Gayed was allowed to practise for decades</a> while leaving a trail of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2019/feb/07/our-stories-the-women-mutilated-by-emil-gayed\">harmed women</a> behind as he moved from place to place.

It is not even the first case of its kind in New South Wales. In 2008, the NSW government promised the public that lessons would be learned when it was discovered that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/28/a-decade-after-the-butcher-of-bega-red-flags-continue-to-be-missed\">gynaecologist Graeme Reeves</a> abused patients over a period of more than 20 years. In response to that scandal, <a href=\"https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/bill/files/431/LC%202708.pdf\">state lawmakers passed the Medical Practice Amendment Act</a>, providing for mandatory reporting when doctors become concerned about a colleague\u2019s misconduct. It is possible that healthcare professionals who knew about Gayed and failed in their statutory obligations could be charged under the Act. Perhaps then we might pay more attention to the pain of iatrogenic harm.</p> <p>Our family owns an elderly cat, and we have a family rule that the first one who notices a pile of cat vomit has to clean up the mess. Unsurprisingly, cat vomit can go unnoticed in our household for a very long time. As in all unpleasant situations, as long as we can avoid stepping in it, we can look the other way and pretend it was an accident that could have befallen anyone. Doctors and nurses knew about Gayed. They know things about other people too.</p> <p>\u2022 Alison Barrett is a member of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (Ranzcog).

      "bodyText": "A consultant doctor in a different speciality to mine came to see me as a patient in New Zealand\u2019s public health system. She needed an operation, and wanted me, a specialist obstetrician and gynaecologist, to do the surgery for her. \u201cAfter all, there\u2019s got to be some benefit to working here,\u201d she said. When I told her I wouldn\u2019t be able to honour her request, she gave me her personal doctor blacklist. The doctors on it were the subjects of repeated whisperings about their practice. She did not want those doctors, or any of the registrars we supervised, anywhere near her. This sort of medical privilege my patient wanted to cash in on is common. We call it \u201cplaying the doctor card.\u201d Playing this card allows doctors to escape certain harms we routinely expose our patients to. Even in the public system we can hand pick our surgeons and avoid the ones who might not meet the current threshold for being struck off. We can feign surprise if they are eventually found out. Perhaps the degree of their offending does really shock us. Nonetheless, when we and our loved ones are sick, it is as if we fly in a parallel first class system that operates outside of our patients\u2019 view. We doctors often like to use the aviation industry to compare safety standards against. There is one big difference between their passengers and our patients. It partly explains why the aviation industry works more effectively to keep people safe and ours does not. If a pilot is incompetent, or, if they take off in a plane they know is unsafe, they will still be found to be at fault when the plane crashes. Crucially, they are also on board. The trouble with doctors is that we are not going down with the plane. Medical rosters may be made with unsafe levels of staff and hours of work, healthcare systems may be so poorly designed to increase the likelihood of harm, and there are incompetent practitioners among us, but chances are that we doctors will not subject ourselves or our own loved ones to the risk. We use our insider knowledge to advantage. Our secret ability to avoid much iatrogenic harm might weaken the incentive to fix these issues. Take the most recent evolving scandal in my field of obstetrics and gynaecology. It happened in Australia, but it could easily have happened anywhere. Questions are now being asked how Emil Shawky Gayed was allowed to practise for decades while leaving a trail of harmed women behind as he moved from place to place. Lawyer Gail Furness, who authored a report into his misconduct, said that after witnessing so many episodes of bad practice \u201cstaff had become desensitised to it\u201d. But when you don\u2019t have your own skin in the game you are not desensitised. You weren\u2019t feeling it in the first place. We need to do something about this problem because, as Guardian journalist Melissa Davey notes, Gayed\u2019s disturbing level of misconduct is not the first such case of its kind. It is not even the first case of its kind in New South Wales. In 2008, the NSW government promised the public that lessons would be learned when it was discovered that gynaecologist Graeme Reeves abused patients over a period of more than 20 years. In response to that scandal, state lawmakers passed the Medical Practice Amendment Act, providing for mandatory reporting when doctors become concerned about a colleague\u2019s misconduct. It is possible that healthcare professionals who knew about Gayed and failed in their statutory obligations could be charged under the Act. Perhaps then we might pay more attention to the pain of iatrogenic harm. Our family owns an elderly cat, and we have a family rule that the first one who notices a pile of cat vomit has to clean up the mess. Unsurprisingly, cat vomit can go unnoticed in our household for a very long time. As in all unpleasant situations, as long as we can avoid stepping in it, we can look the other way and pretend it was an accident that could have befallen anyone. Doctors and nurses knew about Gayed. They know things about other people too. \u2022 Alison Barrett is a member of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (Ranzcog).

The Nauruan government has also passed laws banning medical transfers based on telehealth assessments, threatening to derail the system and potentially breaking international law, according to human rights lawyers. The home affairs secretary, Michael Pezzullo, told Senate estimates late on Monday night it was \u201cthe policy of the government\u201d that under the new legislation refugees and asylum seekers who are found to need a medical transfer will not be sent to mainland Australia, but will first go to Christmas Island. \u201cClearly \u2026 it goes without saying that if specialised treatment is only available on the mainland then the mainland will be utilised,\u201d said Pezzullo, under questions from the Greens senator Nick McKim. McKim said the \u201coutrageous\u201d revelation raised numerous questions and was \u201ca clear denial of the clear intent of the parliament, which is that people get access to better medical treatment, which is not available on Christmas Island\u201d. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said he had no problem with people being sent to Christmas Island first. \u201cIf the medical treatment is delivered and delivered on Christmas Island and it makes people well, that\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. The medical evacuations bill has been at the centre of savage bipartisan fighting. Under the legislation, which is yet to be given royal assent, any person on Manus Island or Nauru who was sent there under Australia\u2019s offshore processing regime and who needs medical attention in Australia can be transferred on the recommendation of two doctors, who could be based on-site or in Australia. Previously people have waited as long as five years without being transferred, despite recommendations by the Australian government\u2019s contracted doctors. Under the new law, if the minister seeks to refuse the transfer on medical grounds, the recommendation must be assessed by an independent panel within 72 hours. The minister can still refuse a transfer on security grounds. In response to the bill passing, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, immediately announced the reopening of the Christmas Island detention centre \u201cboth to deal with the prospect of arrivals as well as dealing with the prospect of transfers\u201d. There are 431 people on Nauru and 584 men on Manus Island. The Christmas Island local council has said the island does not have sufficient medical facilities. \u201cSome of these people would have serious mental problems that need to be dealt with by specialists. We haven\u2019t got the specialists here to do that,\u201d the council chief executive, David Price, told ABC radio. \u201cWe just wouldn\u2019t have the capacity to deal with people coming here for medical reasons, both physically and mentally.\u201d Kerryn Phelps, the independent MP for Wentworth who was a vocal proponent of the bill, said Pezzullo\u2019s claim was a \u201csubversion of our entire model of representative democracy\u201d. \u201cThe parliament through its proper processes clearly determined that people too sick to receive treatment in offshore detention should come to Australia, not Christmas Island, for specialised treatment,\u201d she said. On Tuesday the Greens MP Adam Bandt accused the government of \u201cdirectly defying the will of the parliament\u201d and threatening democracy. \u201cI will support a no-confidence motion,\u201d Bandt said. \u201cI\u2019ll vote for it any time this week. This mob needs to be turfed out as quickly as possible.\u201d The medical evacuation procedure faces another hurdle in Nauru, where the government has passed laws banning overseas medical transfers based on telehealth referrals. Under the regulations, all transfer referrals must come through the Nauru hospital. The referral is then assessed by the controversial overseas medical review panel and signed off by the minister. The law was likely to mean both Nauru and Australia were in breach of international law preventing torture and guaranteeing the right to health, said George Newhouse, principal lawyer at the National Justice Project. \u201cWe are now looking at making complaints to the United Nations, to have these breaches investigated,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are also international laws preventing discrimination on the basis of race, gender and disability status. Both Australia and Nauru could be breaking these laws, by Nauru stopping sick people from accessing medical treatment.\u201d Morrison told 3AW on Tuesday that the Australian government would assess Nauru\u2019s new laws because it wasn\u2019t clear how they would play out, but said: \u201cIt\u2019s their country.\u201d Shorten also said Nauru should be respected as a sovereign government if it passed laws it felt were necessary. \u201cThe issue here is the safe treatment of people within the context of strong borders,\u201d he said, adding that he hadn\u2019t seen the Nauruan legislation. Nauruan officials have previously been accused of blocking the transfer of sick refugees, even those under order from Australia\u2019s federal court. The move affects not only Australia\u2019s medevac system but also the newly launched telehealth service by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. MSF had been providing mental healthcare to asylum seekers, refugees and Nauruans on site for almost a year when it was abruptly kicked off the island by the Nauruan government, which accused it of conspiring with activists to oppose the government. MSF said it had been treating extraordinarily high rates of extreme mental illness among its entire patient cohort and feared for their welfare after the organisation left. This month it launched the telehealth service so it could continue to treat its patients on the island. Guardian Australia understands the Nauruan government was informed of its launch but had not made any comment or responded to it. \u201cThis telehealth service is MSF\u2019s only remaining option to continue to act on our medical and ethical commitment to former patients,\u201d said Christine Rufener, a clinical psychologist and MSF mental health activity manager. While the new law does not outlaw the service, it prevents the MSF staff from referring patients to the review panel for an international transfer unless they send the patient through the Nauruan hospital.",

In the microcosm that is Australian football, with few professional head coach roles going around, every time one pops up the same names emerge. Western Melbourne Group need a new coach? Ante Milicic. South West Sydney need a new coach? Ante Milicic. And the reason his name is always first on the list? Because he\u2019s the best credentialed available coach in the Australian system.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/18/ante-milicic-appointed-matildas-head-coach\">Ante Milicic confirmed as Matildas head coach for World Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Milicic you know what you get. A character who is not abrasive, whose ego won\u2019t be the cause of massive bust-ups or schisms \u2013 either with management, or within the playing group. He\u2019s calm, incredibly professional and hardworking, and under all that has a steely determination and relentless desire to win. Talk to players or staff that have worked around Milicic, and these are the attributes to they mention.</p> <p>As the right-hand man to both Tony Popovic and Ange Postecoglou, Milicic has worked with two of Australia\u2019s most gifted contemporary managers. And the skillset he has developed \u2013&nbsp;working as a player scout, working closely with video analysts \u2013 marries modern football analytics with the old school ways of work ethic and basic toughness that you get from coming up both as a player and a coach through the NSL.</p> <p>All of this is of course coming from the context of men\u2019s football \u2013 with not unreasonable concerns being raised about Milicic\u2019s limited experience in and around the women\u2019s game; after all he has never coached a women\u2019s football team, and now he has been tasked with taking perhaps the most talented generation of Australian footballers ever assembled to potentially win a World Cup.</p> <p>But amid the current febrile atmosphere of accusation and counter-accusation, of suspicion, rumour and constant innuendo, being an \u201coutsider\u201d to the women\u2019s game becomes a strength rather than a weakness.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Milicic is a clean skin with no agendas other than to coach and to get the very best out of a talented group of players</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Milicic doesn\u2019t have W-League club factional alliances \u2013 players he has spurned or promoted in the past. He doesn\u2019t owe passionate powerbrokers of the women\u2019s game anything for historical support. There\u2019s no quid-pro-quo. In a sense, Milicic has the best part of being a foreign coach (being an outsider with no pre-conceptions) and a local coach (a fundamental grounding in the realities and challenges of Australian football). He\u2019s a clean skin with no agendas other than to coach and to get the very best out of a talented group of players.</p> <p>He will come in to the position under no illusions \u2013 the stakes could not be any higher. That\u2019s a facet to the tremendous outpouring of frustration and anxiety surrounding the undignified sacking of predecessor Alen Stajcic \u2013 this could be the only time an Australian football team might ever win a World Cup. Fourteen years ago supporters of the men\u2019s game were jubilant to have just qualified for a World Cup \u2013 having recently beaten the world\u2019s best teams \u2013 United States, Japan, Brazil \u2013 this squad of players are a genuine shot at the trophy.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to suggest this was a well-laid plan from Football Federation Australia \u2013 as the rancour from the past month has demonstrated, the shock sacking of Stajcic couldn\u2019t have been handled worse by the governing body. Either a good man whose management was faultless has been forced out, or a man\u2019s whose management style was no longer advancing the group was let go and the warning signs were repeatedly ignored, kept hidden or hushed up over preceding years. Neither scenarios show FFA management in a good light.</p> <p>If we know anything about the upper echelons of FFA, these are profoundly risk-averse people. A lack of vision and ambition became a major fault line between management and former Socceroos coach Postecoglou, so the sacking of Stajcic \u2013 without the clear evidence of a definitive cause or sufficient reason \u2013 was remarkably out of character. On the basis of what has been confirmed on the public record, at least.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80b9c0abb8e7f3ccc77d9e684eb36448612ffebe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80b9c0abb8e7f3ccc77d9e684eb36448612ffebe/0_89_2489_1493/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alen Stajcic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alen Stajcic, who took the Matildas to sixth in the world, was dismissed last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francois Nel/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With trust in the governance of the sport at a recent low, this appointment couldn\u2019t have been more crucial. Those prominent media voices alleging a gender-based conspiracy against Stajcic made the appointment of a female head coach nigh on impossible \u2013 and while that long-held preference may be realised with the next permanent appointment post-France World Cup, for now, neutralising such an accusation is a sound strategy.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the environment the new coach is walking into remains beset with potential banana skins. A talented overseas coach such as a Vera Pauw, believed to have been on a six-person shortlist for the Matildas job, would take months familiarising herself with the conditions, the challenges, the personalities and the politics of the Australian scene \u2013 time the Matildas don\u2019t have if they\u2019re to reach optimal performance.</p> <p>With schisms inside the playing group exacerbated by the poor-handling of Stajcic\u2019s departure, any new coach is walking into a potential minefield. That assistant coach Gary van Egmond has been retained remains a concern. Given the accusations of favouritism and preferential treatment of certain players that began to dog the Stajcic era, it is simply inconceivable that a father-daughter dynamic is allowed to continue within a professional environment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/11/my-career-is-in-tatters-alen-stajcic-breaks-silence-on-matildas-sacking\">'My career is in tatters': Alen Stajcic breaks silence on Matildas sacking</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But if there is one coach who has the temperament and skillset to navigate the fraught dynamics of Australian women\u2019s football right now, it\u2019s Milicic.</p> <p>More than that, in Milicic the Matildas may have just found a coach who can truly unlock the potential of this hugely gifted, passionate and determined group of players. A coach that can balance the attacking verve of Postecoglou with the resolute defence of Popovic.</p> <p>With the Matildas\u2019 results tailing off over the past 12 months, the very best attacking instincts of Sam Kerr, Caitlin Foord or Michelle Heyman can be revitalised. A midfield that boasts some of the best technical footballers we\u2019ve seen \u2013 players like Elise Kellond-Knight, Katrina Gorry or Emily van Egmond \u2013 can play freely again. And a defence that mixes the vast experience of Lydia Williams and Claire Polkinghorne with the ever-increasing potential of Alanna Kennedy and Steph Catley can galvanise even closer.</p> <p>The way FFA has arrived at its decision may well have been disgraceful \u2013 but with the appointment of Ante Milicic, the governing body might just have found the coach to give Australia their best ever shot at winning a World Cup.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In recent times when an A-League club needed a new head coach two phone calls were placed. One was to Ange Postecoglou, the other was to FFA HQ. Who is the best coach out there? Who has shown promise coming through the national team ranks? The logic behind poaching an Under-17s, Under-20s or Under-23s national team coach is clear \u2013 you\u2019re getting a coach with access to the best resources, best facilities and best players in the country. In the microcosm that is Australian football, with few professional head coach roles going around, every time one pops up the same names emerge. Western Melbourne Group need a new coach? Ante Milicic. South West Sydney need a new coach? Ante Milicic. And the reason his name is always first on the list? Because he\u2019s the best credentialed available coach in the Australian system. In Milicic you know what you get. A character who is not abrasive, whose ego won\u2019t be the cause of massive bust-ups or schisms \u2013 either with management, or within the playing group. He\u2019s calm, incredibly professional and hardworking, and under all that has a steely determination and relentless desire to win. Talk to players or staff that have worked around Milicic, and these are the attributes to they mention. As the right-hand man to both Tony Popovic and Ange Postecoglou, Milicic has worked with two of Australia\u2019s most gifted contemporary managers. And the skillset he has developed \u2013 working as a player scout, working closely with video analysts \u2013 marries modern football analytics with the old school ways of work ethic and basic toughness that you get from coming up both as a player and a coach through the NSL. All of this is of course coming from the context of men\u2019s football \u2013 with not unreasonable concerns being raised about Milicic\u2019s limited experience in and around the women\u2019s game; after all he has never coached a women\u2019s football team, and now he has been tasked with taking perhaps the most talented generation of Australian footballers ever assembled to potentially win a World Cup. But amid the current febrile atmosphere of accusation and counter-accusation, of suspicion, rumour and constant innuendo, being an \u201coutsider\u201d to the women\u2019s game becomes a strength rather than a weakness. Milicic doesn\u2019t have W-League club factional alliances \u2013 players he has spurned or promoted in the past. He doesn\u2019t owe passionate powerbrokers of the women\u2019s game anything for historical support. There\u2019s no quid-pro-quo. In a sense, Milicic has the best part of being a foreign coach (being an outsider with no pre-conceptions) and a local coach (a fundamental grounding in the realities and challenges of Australian football). He\u2019s a clean skin with no agendas other than to coach and to get the very best out of a talented group of players. He will come in to the position under no illusions \u2013 the stakes could not be any higher. That\u2019s a facet to the tremendous outpouring of frustration and anxiety surrounding the undignified sacking of predecessor Alen Stajcic \u2013 this could be the only time an Australian football team might ever win a World Cup. Fourteen years ago supporters of the men\u2019s game were jubilant to have just qualified for a World Cup \u2013 having recently beaten the world\u2019s best teams \u2013 United States, Japan, Brazil \u2013 this squad of players are a genuine shot at the trophy. That\u2019s not to suggest this was a well-laid plan from Football Federation Australia \u2013 as the rancour from the past month has demonstrated, the shock sacking of Stajcic couldn\u2019t have been handled worse by the governing body. Either a good man whose management was faultless has been forced out, or a man\u2019s whose management style was no longer advancing the group was let go and the warning signs were repeatedly ignored, kept hidden or hushed up over preceding years. Neither scenarios show FFA management in a good light. If we know anything about the upper echelons of FFA, these are profoundly risk-averse people. A lack of vision and ambition became a major fault line between management and former Socceroos coach Postecoglou, so the sacking of Stajcic \u2013 without the clear evidence of a definitive cause or sufficient reason \u2013 was remarkably out of character. On the basis of what has been confirmed on the public record, at least. With trust in the governance of the sport at a recent low, this appointment couldn\u2019t have been more crucial. Those prominent media voices alleging a gender-based conspiracy against Stajcic made the appointment of a female head coach nigh on impossible \u2013 and while that long-held preference may be realised with the next permanent appointment post-France World Cup, for now, neutralising such an accusation is a sound strategy. Nevertheless, the environment the new coach is walking into remains beset with potential banana skins. A talented overseas coach such as a Vera Pauw, believed to have been on a six-person shortlist for the Matildas job, would take months familiarising herself with the conditions, the challenges, the personalities and the politics of the Australian scene \u2013 time the Matildas don\u2019t have if they\u2019re to reach optimal performance. With schisms inside the playing group exacerbated by the poor-handling of Stajcic\u2019s departure, any new coach is walking into a potential minefield. That assistant coach Gary van Egmond has been retained remains a concern. Given the accusations of favouritism and preferential treatment of certain players that began to dog the Stajcic era, it is simply inconceivable that a father-daughter dynamic is allowed to continue within a professional environment. But if there is one coach who has the temperament and skillset to navigate the fraught dynamics of Australian women\u2019s football right now, it\u2019s Milicic. More than that, in Milicic the Matildas may have just found a coach who can truly unlock the potential of this hugely gifted, passionate and determined group of players. A coach that can balance the attacking verve of Postecoglou with the resolute defence of Popovic. With the Matildas\u2019 results tailing off over the past 12 months, the very best attacking instincts of Sam Kerr, Caitlin Foord or Michelle Heyman can be revitalised. A midfield that boasts some of the best technical footballers we\u2019ve seen \u2013 players like Elise Kellond-Knight, Katrina Gorry or Emily van Egmond \u2013 can play freely again. And a defence that mixes the vast experience of Lydia Williams and Claire Polkinghorne with the ever-increasing potential of Alanna Kennedy and Steph Catley can galvanise even closer. The way FFA has arrived at its decision may well have been disgraceful \u2013 but with the appointment of Ante Milicic, the governing body might just have found the coach to give Australia their best ever shot at winning a World Cup.",

Since Howard\u2019s defeat, tension between Liberal wets and dries has become endemic, with Scott Morrison merely the latest leader tilting from one faction to the other according to the shifting political winds. The chaos reflects not the failure of individual politicians but an inability to present a coherent political project behind which the right\u2019s traditional support base might be mobilised. Similarly, Hawke won power with an astonishing 78% approval rating, while the latest polls put Shorten at an equally remarkable negative 15. Again, that\u2019s not a personal flaw but indicative of a deeper uncertainty about who and what Labor represents, given its declining links to its traditional constituency. In 1983, Hawke convinced organised labour to back an Accord meant to transform the economy on workers\u2019 behalf. In 2019, with the union movement greatly diminished, Shorten offers at best tepid support to the ACTU\u2019s Change the Rules campaign. The ALP\u2019s likely victory in the next election thus reflects public disdain for the Liberals rather than enthusiasm for a Labor project. We\u2019re set for a familiar pattern: an unpopular leader with no real agenda or mandate, fending off internal challenges, and reliant on culture war and media stunts to beat back the opposition. The absence of a stable social base leaves governments without the authority to tackle difficult issues. The parliamentary convulsions accompanying the medevac bill provide an obvious example, with asylum seeker policy still based on piecemeal, ad hoc expedients slung together in response to an immediate crisis and then retained indefinitely in lieu of anything better. Yes, the politics of borders are complicated. But they don\u2019t present nearly as much of a challenge as the environmental situation. We know that the biggest threat to insect populations comes from industrial farming. The advanced economies increasingly rely on unsustainable agricultural techniques, intensive use of pesticide and fertiliser, and the systematic clearance of forests, so much so that experts attribute about two-thirds of the loss of wildlife to food manufacture. Furthermore, according to the World Resources Food Institute, production must rise by half in the next 30 years just sustain the growing world\u2019s population. In other words, any meaningful response to \u201cinsectageddon\u201d requires fundamental changes in agriculture and thus the world economy \u2013 even as we address the separate but related problem of climate change. Can you imagine a single contemporary politician putting forward a program for that? Think of the agonised process that eventually resulted in marriage reform. Equality required merely a simple (and overwhelmingly popular) legislative change. And yet successive parliaments tied themselves in knots failing to deliver it \u2013 until a public campaign delivered the extra-parliamentary yes vote that broke the deadlock. Indeed, the popular mobilisation for marriage reform hints at the only way out of the mess that we\u2019re in. Even if parliamentarians wanted to address the environmental emergency (and clearly many of them don\u2019t), they no longer possess the kind of support base to deliver radical change. That\u2019s why, as the school students leading climate strikes have realised, we need to build our own constituency for action, creating the kind of mass movement that makes change impossible \u2013 even for politicians \u2013 to resist. \u2022 Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist",
