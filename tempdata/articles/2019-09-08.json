The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods. This has also been referred to by government ministers as an \"Australia-style deal\". Australia does not have a free trade agreement with the EU.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Peter Hemington, of BDO LLP, said: \u201cThis month\u2019s dramatic fall in confidence is a very worrying event.

Economists at the accountancy firm KPMG said that the knock-on effects to Britain\u2019s trade and business confidence of a no-deal Brexit would lead to the economy shrinking by 1.5% next year. Consumer spending, which has provided between 60% and 80% of growth in the economy over the last three years, would also be severely dented. The warning follows forecasts by the Bank of England and the Treasury\u2019s independent forecasting unit, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which have alerted the government to the negative economic consequences of losing access to the EU single market and customs union overnight. The central bank and the OBR have predicted a recession in the wake of a no-deal Brexit. KPMG forecasts that securing a deal ahead of the 31 October deadline would have the opposite effect of boosting GDP growth to 1.5% in 2020. Yael Selfin, KPMG UK\u2019s chief economist, said she expected that in every quarter of next year the economy would contract, leading to the first recession since 2009 and the aftermath of the financial crisis. \u201cWith the Brexit debate poised on a knife-edge, the UK economy is now at a crossroads. It is difficult to think of another time when the UK has been on the verge of two economic out-turns that are so different, but the impact of a no-deal Brexit should not be underestimated,\u201d she said. \u201cDespite headwinds such as the slowing global economy and limited domestic capacity, the UK economy now has the potential to strengthen over the next 12 months. But a no-deal Brexit could put paid to this upside, triggering the UK\u2019s first recession for a decade.\u201d The economy has already slowed in recent months, with only the services sector continuing to expand, according to official figures. An industry survey by business advisers BDO found that optimism in the sector fell dramatically last month as the prospect of a recession became a possibility A survey of more than 4,000 services firms found that optimism was now at levels not seen since 2013. Peter Hemington, of BDO LLP, said: \u201cThis month\u2019s dramatic fall in confidence is a very worrying event. Pessimistic companies don\u2019t invest or hire, which is how recessions start.\u201d Selfin said a no-deal Brexit threatened household confidence, business investment and cross-border trade, \u201cwith policymakers lacking the means to fully mitigate negative impacts\u201d. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said its review of the UK\u2019s readiness for a post-Brexit recession found that neither the government nor the Bank of England had the means to prevent the economy slipping into a prolonged downturn. It said policy changes over the last 10 years linked to the government\u2019s austerity programme meant the poorest households had lost access to benefits that protected them in the 2008 crash from falling into extreme poverty. A switch from generous tax credit payments, which topped up wages when workers were forced to accept shorter hours or lost their jobs, to universal credit was a key reason poorer households were more vulnerable in a recession, the thinktank warned. \u201cThe UK\u2019s macroeconomic policy framework has not kept pace with significant changes to our economic environment and is therefore at risk of leaving the country underprepared for the next recession.

In needling Labour over its attempt to whip obedience to its changed position on Europe, he said: \u201cAn occasional revelation, a single journey to Damascus, is respectable, but when a whole party goes in for a package tour the gullibility of onlookers is strained beyond endurance.\u201d Much of Heath\u2019s 1971 statement anticipating joining could readily serve Boris Johnson soon if he manages to leave: \u201cNow we stand ready to take our first step into a new world full of new opportunities \u2026 Let us show ourselves to that new world as we would wish it to see us \u2013 confident, proud and strong.\u201d \u2022 Paul Chadwick is the Guardian\u2019s readers\u2019 editor",

But they emphasised that there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/05/has-the-age-of-austerity-really-come-to-an-end-sajid-javid\" title=\"\">a long way to go before ministers would see the back of austerity</a>.</p> <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) and the Resolution Foundation, which vie to have the last word on tax and spending policies, agreed that an average increase of 4.1% in Whitehall budgets represented a chunky boost, if only for the 2020-21 financial year covered by the review.</p> <p>They were less convinced that the money on offer was enough to restore Britain\u2019s battered public services and shrinking welfare state. Downplaying the impact on most departmental spending, the IFS said that, excluding health, the additional boost would be enough to reverse only around a quarter of the cuts since 2010. Worse, if the calculation takes account of the UK\u2019s rising population, the increase claws back just 15% of cuts in spending since 2010 on a per-capita basis.</p> <p>Arguably, government thinking is limited by a narrow focus on the UK\u2019s older voters, whom the Tory party needs to keep inside the fold as an election approaches.</p> <p>Increasing strain on the health system, which warranted a large slug of the extra spending, comes mainly from an ageing population. Likewise, a rise in funding for local government was mostly directed at social care, a service required mostly by older people.</p> <p>Even the money set aside for 20,000 extra police officers can be seen as a sop to the old, who fear crime beyond anything that shows up in the figures. The huge number of trainee positions is well above what police chiefs asked for. And so it is assumed the excessive figure is part of Boris Johnson\u2019s voter-friendly policy playbook.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is assumed the huge number of new police trainees is part of Boris Johnson\u2019s voter-friendly policy playbook</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As an election tactic, it probably works well. But ministers should be spending wisely and rethinking some of the priorities of 10 years ago, not simply pushing staff numbers back to previous highs.</p> <p>Education is another case of spending with an election \u2013 rather than the sustainability and success of public services \u2013 in mind. Javid said that he would restore funding lost in recent rounds of cuts, adding \u00a37.1bn over three years to the schools budget.</p> <p>Will that funding be sensibly spent? The Department for Education wants to expand teacher recruitment, yet without addressing why surveys show that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/apr/16/fifth-of-teachers-plan-to-leave-profession-within-two-years\" title=\"\">a fifth of teachers expect to leave the profession</a> in the next two years.</p> <p>There are also concerns that the money will be directed at schools in Tory shires, leaving many pupils from low-income families in the big cities unprotected from further budget cuts.</p> <p>These are not plans for a \u201cnew beginning\u201d. They are slanted too much to short-term gain for that.</p> <p>Making matters worse, the spending plans are based on economic forecasts dating back to the spring and, without tax rises or other ways of raising money, are unfunded. Whether there is a last-minute Brexit deal or the UK crashes out of the EU on 31 October, the economy is weaker than it was in spring and government receipts will be lower than in those forecasts.</p> <p>All this means that when Javid swaps his Scrooge outfit for a Santa suit and shakes the magic money tree, he is neither deploying his funds sensibly, nor being prudent.</p> <h2>We are too far down the line to give up on HS2 now</h2> <p>The announcement that HS2 would cost \u00a388bn instead of \u00a356bn was a revelation that surprised no one. According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/03/hs2-to-be-delayed-by-up-to-five-years\" title=\"\">the conclusions of the current chairman</a> of HS2 Ltd, the first train services will be at least two years behind schedule and final completion could lag by seven years to 2040 \u2013 timescales which almost certainly imply further cost spirals ahead.</p> <p>The new transport secretary, Grant Shapps, did the right thing in releasing the report. Whatever the government may eventually decide after the short Oakervee review into HS2\u2019s costs and benefits, part of the ugly truth is in the open. Transparency is essential, both from HS2 and government.</p> <p>Both bear a portion of the blame for the current mess. Doubtless, HS2 Ltd has allowed swollen salaries and controversial payoffs that, at the very least, contravened public sector rules. Ministers cannot have been unaware of the pressure on budgets, and it was wishful thinking or wilful blindness to dole out concessions such as generous property compensation while claiming the budget ceiling could never be broken. It now transpires that geological surveys along much of the 330-mile route were yet to be conducted before HS2 decided how much it would cost to build the railway.</p> <p>But letting the sunlight in on HS2 Ltd should not blind us to the project\u2019s virtues. As with any public expenditure, the game of finding more deserving causes is easy. But HS2 has gained as much consensus as any infrastructure scheme, been legislated for, and is now under way to the tune of \u00a37bn. Even if a cheaper project might have been better in hindsight, any alternative would now spend another decade in the purgatory of planning and debate. For all its faults, eventually the high-speed line will enhance Britain. The nation will be best served by ploughing on, however reluctantly, with HS2.</p> <h2>Watchdog\u2019s weedy approach to Viagogo leaves fans exposed</h2> <p>Critics of the controversial ticket resale website Viagogo have been left scratching their heads after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/sep/05/watchdog-drops-viagogo-legal-case-after-changes-on-resale-site\" title=\"\">suspended its legal pursuit of the company</a> for contempt of court.</p> <p>The consumer watchdog <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jul/04/cma-seeks-to-find-viagogo-in-contempt-of-court\" title=\"\">resorted to the courts</a> this year, after accusing Viagogo of repeatedly flouting laws designed to protect the public from sharp business practice.</p> <p>The CMA now says Viagogo has mended its ways but music industry groups and ticket industry sources insist that they\u2019ve seen examples as recently as last week that should test the regulator\u2019s confidence.</p> <p>It took the CMA far too long to act, but when the regulator finally stirred it gave Viagogo \u2013 a well-resourced multinational company \u2013 plenty of time to make changes that it should have made voluntarily. Now, after a \u00a32m investigation, the CMA appears to have given in.</p> <p>In its statement, the regulator said its tussle with Viagogo lent weight to its campaign to be given greater regulatory powers. It\u2019s hard not to think its weedy approach was always intended to highlight its impotence and bolster its case for better enforcement tools.</p> <p>Even if Viagogo were fully compliant with consumer law, there remains a debate to be had over the morality, rather than the legality, of the secondary ticketing market.</p> <p>The recent experience of Ed Sheeran fans, who were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/30/ed-sheeran-criticised-by-fans-as-anti-touting-scheme-backfires\" title=\"\">left unable to sell tickets they couldn\u2019t use</a> due to unfair resale restrictions, shows some form of market must exist for fans to recoup some, or all, of their money if they can\u2019t go to a show. But permitting resale at vastly marked-up prices only ends up hitting devoted fans in the pocket, undermining efforts made by some artists to keep ticket costs down.</p> <p>It is the owners of secondary ticketing websites \u2013 and the parasitic touts who use them \u2013 who reap the rewards of this skewed marketplace. What role do such people have in the music industry, other than to exploit fans\u2019 passion for their profit?</p>",

Worse, if the calculation takes account of the UK\u2019s rising population, the increase claws back just 15% of cuts in spending since 2010 on a per-capita basis. Arguably, government thinking is limited by a narrow focus on the UK\u2019s older voters, whom the Tory party needs to keep inside the fold as an election approaches. Increasing strain on the health system, which warranted a large slug of the extra spending, comes mainly from an ageing population. Likewise, a rise in funding for local government was mostly directed at social care, a service required mostly by older people. Even the money set aside for 20,000 extra police officers can be seen as a sop to the old, who fear crime beyond anything that shows up in the figures. The huge number of trainee positions is well above what police chiefs asked for. And so it is assumed the excessive figure is part of Boris Johnson\u2019s voter-friendly policy playbook. As an election tactic, it probably works well. But ministers should be spending wisely and rethinking some of the priorities of 10 years ago, not simply pushing staff numbers back to previous highs. Education is another case of spending with an election \u2013 rather than the sustainability and success of public services \u2013 in mind. Javid said that he would restore funding lost in recent rounds of cuts, adding \u00a37.1bn over three years to the schools budget. Will that funding be sensibly spent? The Department for Education wants to expand teacher recruitment, yet without addressing why surveys show that a fifth of teachers expect to leave the profession in the next two years. There are also concerns that the money will be directed at schools in Tory shires, leaving many pupils from low-income families in the big cities unprotected from further budget cuts. These are not plans for a \u201cnew beginning\u201d. They are slanted too much to short-term gain for that. Making matters worse, the spending plans are based on economic forecasts dating back to the spring and, without tax rises or other ways of raising money, are unfunded. Whether there is a last-minute Brexit deal or the UK crashes out of the EU on 31 October, the economy is weaker than it was in spring and government receipts will be lower than in those forecasts. All this means that when Javid swaps his Scrooge outfit for a Santa suit and shakes the magic money tree, he is neither deploying his funds sensibly, nor being prudent. We are too far down the line to give up on HS2 now The announcement that HS2 would cost \u00a388bn instead of \u00a356bn was a revelation that surprised no one. According to the conclusions of the current chairman of HS2 Ltd, the first train services will be at least two years behind schedule and final completion could lag by seven years to 2040 \u2013 timescales which almost certainly imply further cost spirals ahead. The new transport secretary, Grant Shapps, did the right thing in releasing the report. Whatever the government may eventually decide after the short Oakervee review into HS2\u2019s costs and benefits, part of the ugly truth is in the open. Transparency is essential, both from HS2 and government. Both bear a portion of the blame for the current mess. Doubtless, HS2 Ltd has allowed swollen salaries and controversial payoffs that, at the very least, contravened public sector rules. Ministers cannot have been unaware of the pressure on budgets, and it was wishful thinking or wilful blindness to dole out concessions such as generous property compensation while claiming the budget ceiling could never be broken. It now transpires that geological surveys along much of the 330-mile route were yet to be conducted before HS2 decided how much it would cost to build the railway. But letting the sunlight in on HS2 Ltd should not blind us to the project\u2019s virtues. As with any public expenditure, the game of finding more deserving causes is easy. But HS2 has gained as much consensus as any infrastructure scheme, been legislated for, and is now under way to the tune of \u00a37bn. Even if a cheaper project might have been better in hindsight, any alternative would now spend another decade in the purgatory of planning and debate. For all its faults, eventually the high-speed line will enhance Britain. The nation will be best served by ploughing on, however reluctantly, with HS2. Watchdog\u2019s weedy approach to Viagogo leaves fans exposed Critics of the controversial ticket resale website Viagogo have been left scratching their heads after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) suspended its legal pursuit of the company for contempt of court. The consumer watchdog resorted to the courts this year, after accusing Viagogo of repeatedly flouting laws designed to protect the public from sharp business practice. The CMA now says Viagogo has mended its ways but music industry groups and ticket industry sources insist that they\u2019ve seen examples as recently as last week that should test the regulator\u2019s confidence. It took the CMA far too long to act, but when the regulator finally stirred it gave Viagogo \u2013 a well-resourced multinational company \u2013 plenty of time to make changes that it should have made voluntarily. Now, after a \u00a32m investigation, the CMA appears to have given in. In its statement, the regulator said its tussle with Viagogo lent weight to its campaign to be given greater regulatory powers. It\u2019s hard not to think its weedy approach was always intended to highlight its impotence and bolster its case for better enforcement tools. Even if Viagogo were fully compliant with consumer law, there remains a debate to be had over the morality, rather than the legality, of the secondary ticketing market. The recent experience of Ed Sheeran fans, who were left unable to sell tickets they couldn\u2019t use due to unfair resale restrictions, shows some form of market must exist for fans to recoup some, or all, of their money if they can\u2019t go to a show. But permitting resale at vastly marked-up prices only ends up hitting devoted fans in the pocket, undermining efforts made by some artists to keep ticket costs down. It is the owners of secondary ticketing websites \u2013 and the parasitic touts who use them \u2013 who reap the rewards of this skewed marketplace. What role do such people have in the music industry, other than to exploit fans\u2019 passion for their profit?",

The government has tabled another motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FTPA) calling for an early election. MPs will vote on this on Monday, but the opposition parties have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/opposition-parties-agree-block-snap-election-until-brexit-delay-secured\">agreed not to support it</a>, so it will not receive the backing of the two-thirds of MPs needed to pass it.</p> <p>The government could attempt to pass a one-line amendment to the act, setting an election date, but that option is not so appealing because it could be amended by rebel MPs.</p> <p>It now looks likely Johnson will go ahead and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/28/what-is-prorogation-prorogue-parliament-boris-johnson-brexit\">prorogue parliament</a>, perhaps as soon as the end of Monday\u2019s session. MPs are not then due to return to Westminster until 14 October, when the government plans to hold a Queen\u2019s speech setting out its domestic priorities.</p> <p>These are usually debated for about six days. Even if the government loses a vote on the Queen\u2019s speech, it is not formally considered a matter of no confidence under the FTPA \u2013 though it would be a crystal clear signal that Johnson has no majority in parliament and Labour could be tempted to table a motion of no confidence.</p> <h2>Could Britain still leave the EU with a deal?</h2> <p>Yes: Amber Rudd said the government\u2019s lack of seriousness about trying to renegotiate a Brexit deal was one reason for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/07/amber-rudd-resigns-from-cabinet-and-surrenders-conservative-whip\">her resignation</a>. But with no deal looking impossible without an epic constitutional bustup, winning a deal that could get through parliament now looks like the most straightforward way out of the mire for Johnson.</p> <p>Whether or not he is serious about achieving that is a matter of debate, but almost all of the Tory rebels would vote for a deal \u2013 and indeed have already done so before.

      "bodyText": "Will there be an election before 31 October? It now looks very unlikely. The government has tabled another motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FTPA) calling for an early election. MPs will vote on this on Monday, but the opposition parties have agreed not to support it, so it will not receive the backing of the two-thirds of MPs needed to pass it. The government could attempt to pass a one-line amendment to the act, setting an election date, but that option is not so appealing because it could be amended by rebel MPs. It now looks likely Johnson will go ahead and prorogue parliament, perhaps as soon as the end of Monday\u2019s session. MPs are not then due to return to Westminster until 14 October, when the government plans to hold a Queen\u2019s speech setting out its domestic priorities. These are usually debated for about six days. Even if the government loses a vote on the Queen\u2019s speech, it is not formally considered a matter of no confidence under the FTPA \u2013 though it would be a crystal clear signal that Johnson has no majority in parliament and Labour could be tempted to table a motion of no confidence. Could Britain still leave the EU with a deal? Yes: Amber Rudd said the government\u2019s lack of seriousness about trying to renegotiate a Brexit deal was one reason for her resignation. But with no deal looking impossible without an epic constitutional bustup, winning a deal that could get through parliament now looks like the most straightforward way out of the mire for Johnson. Whether or not he is serious about achieving that is a matter of debate, but almost all of the Tory rebels would vote for a deal \u2013 and indeed have already done so before. A cohort of Labour MPs who do not want Brexit to be stopped would be likely to join them. Johnson will be in Dublin on Monday meeting Leo Varadkar in an attempt to find some common ground on the Irish border. He has already suggested an all-Ireland agrifood zone and there is some speculation at Westminster that the ultimate plan could be something like an Ireland-only backstop. That was rejected by Theresa May because of the Democratic Unionist party\u2019s vehement objections, but if it opened to the way to the looser, free-trade deal-style future relationship he wants, would Johnson be willing to throw his confidence-and-supply partners overboard? Even with their support, he has no majority now anyway. Can Johnson just ignore parliament if he fails to get a new Brexit deal? The bill passed last week by the rebel alliance mandates the prime minister to write to fellow EU leaders and request an extension to the article 50 period if he has not either passed a deal in parliament or won a majority vote for a no-deal Brexit by 19 October. He has repeatedly said he will not request a delay under any circumstances but cabinet ministers have also insisted he will obey the law. It is unclear whether Downing Street believes there is some wriggle room in the way the legislation has been drafted that gives the government a get-out or whether there is an intention to contest the issue through the courts. The rebels believe they have allowed sufficient time, if necessary, to challenge the government all the way to the supreme court, as Gina Miller did over allowing MPs a vote on triggering article 50. Johnson and his strategists believe that while such a move would provoke outrage, it will allow him to portray Jeremy Corbyn as part of a remainer establishment, plotting to overturn the result of the referendum. When will there be a general election? Soon: John McDonnell repeated on Sunday that Labour was keen to go to the polls once a no-deal Brexit was \u201coff the table\u201d. Corbyn and his close advisers would have been happy to sign up for an election immediately once the backbench bill receives royal assent \u2013 expected to happen on Monday \u2013 and that was what the Labour leader said in parliament last week. But that position shifted under pressure from Keir Starmer and many Labour backbenchers, who wanted to see the extension to article 50 secured first. An election could come about either because Corbyn tables a vote of no confidence and Johnson loses it, or because after a delay is secured, the government makes another attempt to trigger a poll and the opposition parties back it. If Johnson lost a confidence vote, Corbyn would have 14 parliamentary sitting days to try to assemble an alternative majority. He has suggested he would seek to lead a time-limited caretaker government to prevent no deal and then call an election, though the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, has suggested a more neutral backbench figure would be a better temporary leader.",

      "body": "<p>At 11am last Tuesday a group of senior Tory MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit gathered outside the cabinet room at No 10 for a meeting with the prime minister. The former chancellor Philip Hammond, the ex-justice secretary David Gauke and the former business secretary Greg Clark were among them. Along with other Tory MPs, including Sir Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve, and Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer and Hilary Benn, they had spent their summer holidays drawing up a bill they believed would force Boris Johnson to seek an extension to Brexit if he could not strike a new deal with the EU by mid-October.</p> <p>Johnson had insisted before and since becoming prime minister that he would never ask the EU for another postponement and would take the UK out of the EU on 31 October \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d, \u201cdo or die\u201d. To limit the amount of parliamentary time the rebels would have to pass the bill,<strong> </strong>the prime<strong> </strong>minister had already announced he would<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/28/boris-johnsons-move-to-prorogue-parliament-a-constitutional-outrage-says-speaker\" title=\"\"> shut parliament down</a> for five weeks from next week ahead of a new Queen\u2019s speech on 14 October. But the cross-party alliance opposed to no deal had moved fast in response, and accelerated their plans. As they chatted before the meeting, they were confident they had both the numbers to get the bill on the statute book and the time to do so before parliament was closed.</p> <p>Outside in Whitehall, and down the road in Parliament Square, a constant din of protest and counter-protest rang out from Remainers and Leavers alike. It was parliament\u2019s first day back after the long July and August recess \u2013 and the controversial prorogation announcement. Police had separated people on different sides of the Brexit divide as best they could but still arguments broke out between them on the pavement. Remainers chanted \u201cstop the coup\u201d while Leavers carried banners saying \u201cTraitor Parliament\u201d and \u201cBoris. No Deal is Ideal\u201d. Opposite the entrance to the Commons one of the protesters, Dr John Dinnen, said he had woken up at 2am so worried about what Brexit would mean for peace on the island of Ireland, where he was born, that he had decided to get a train from Hereford to protest about a possible no deal. \u201cI feel very strongly about it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>When the No 10 meeting got under way, the former Tory ministers \u2013 members of the so-called Gaukeward Squad \u2013 asked Johnson what proposals he had to break the deadlock with Brussels and secure a new agreement to stop the UK crashing out in less than two months\u2019 time. If he really had such a plan, and it proved acceptable to the EU and parliament, they made clear that their efforts to force him to go to Brussels to ask for another delay would be unnecessary and everyone would be happy.</p> <p>\u201cHe had a folder on the desk with him and pointed at it, suggesting the plans were inside,\u201d said one source at the meeting. The MPs then inquired whether the folder\u2019s contents had been presented to EU leaders. \u201cHis response was that the EU would only really begin negotiating in earnest when it was sure the UK was serious about no deal,\u201d said another source. \u201cAnd the PM was clear the EU was not yet sure that we were serious about no deal so nothing had been sent to them yet.\u201d</p> <p>The message Johnson wanted to convey was that the MPs\u2019 attempts to block no deal were taking the heat off Brussels. During an hour of discussions, Clark asked for some specific details on particular issues and Johnson said someone from his office would get back to him. Later that day, Clark received a phone call from Johnson\u2019s closest aide, Dominic Cummings, which failed to provide answers. Instead Clark found himself on the end of a foul-mouthed tirade.</p> <p>According to sources aware of the exchange, Cummings bawled at him, saying: \u201cWhen are you MPs going to realise that we are leaving on 31 October?\u201d before adding: \u201cWe are going to fucking purge you.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3de660a566082c8e991130a347486a99a36b2de2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3de660a566082c8e991130a347486a99a36b2de2/549_215_2951_1770/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaks in the House of Commonson Tuesday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaking in the House of Commons for the first time on Tuesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Taylor/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just a few hours after the meeting, Johnson made his first speech in the chamber as prime minister. Reporting on the G7 summit in Biarritz, he struck a different tone about the Brexit talks. \u201cIt is simply not true to say we are not making progress,\u201d he said. \u201cI returned from the G7 with real momentum in the Brexit discussions.\u201d This ran contrary not only to the impression he had given to rebel MPs earlier, but also to a report that day in the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> which had quoted Cummings as having admitted in a private meeting that negotiations with the EU were \u201ca sham\u201d.</p> <p>As Johnson spoke, the Tory MP Phillip Lee, a Remainer,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/03/commons-showdown-looms-in-battle-over-no-deal-brexit-live?page=with:block-5d6e9e7e8f082da28762cb25\" title=\"\"> crossed the floor of the house to join the Liberal Democrats on the opposition benches</a>. In an instant Johnson had lost his majority; his ability to govern was draining away. Lee and the rebels could see that the Prime Minister was putting out one set of messages in private and another in public. \u201cThe only conclusion to be drawn was that he was actually planning for No Deal,\u201d said one of the rebels. Lee wrote in his resignation letter that Brexit had transformed the Conservative party into a \u201cnarrow faction\u201d that had \u201cincreasingly become infected with the twin diseases of populism and English nationalism\u201d.</p> <p>Later, during a debate that evening on the rebel plan to take control of parliamentary business, the leader of the Commons, Jacob-Rees Mogg, reclined on the government frontbench. The image went viral within minutes. He was accused of being \u201ccontemptuous of this house\u201d by the Green MP Caroline Lucas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ce4066e26809d41c38434dd44edc8e5230e12911\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce4066e26809d41c38434dd44edc8e5230e12911/9_805_2137_1281/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacob Rees-Mogg relaxing on the front benches\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The photo of Jacob Rees-Mogg relaxing on the front benches rapidly went viral.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the result of the vote on the Tory rebel plan was announced, the opposition benches erupted while Tory Remainers tried to control their glee. The government had lost by 328 to 301 votes. Twenty-one Conservative MPs had defied their party by voting to allow debate on a bill that would force their own prime minister to ask the EU for an extension \u2013 which he had promised over and over again never to do.</p> <p>As MPs left the chamber, the purge Cummings had threatened began. All rebel MPs, including the father of the house, Kenneth Clarke, and Sir Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill, had the whip withdrawn, and were told they would not be allowed to stand as Conservatives at the next election. The veteran Tory MP Roger Gale said Johnson was \u201cin danger of tearing the party apart\u201d and rumours spread that cabinet ministers, including Amber Rudd, were seething and considering how long they could remain in the government.</p> <p>It was clear by the evening that part one of the Johnson/Cummings masterplan - to use prorogation coupled with threats - had not only failed spectacularly but had backfired. One of those who were purged, the former foreign office minister Alistair Burt says: \u201cI have never seen a government strategy so misjudged, nor fail so speedily, as that devised in Downing Street since late July.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/08/boris-johnson-tory-rebels-trust-brexit-deal\">All trust is gone ... and the PM only has one way out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The treatment of grandees such as Clarke and Soames had upset Tory MPs of all Brexit persuasions, even some of the most committed Leavers, such as Sir Edward Leigh, who voiced his disquiet at a meeting of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers. The rebels said the behaviour of No 10 was swelling their numbers, not reducing them so had been utterly counter-productive as well as deeply divisive.</p> <p>On the Tory benches on Wednesday \u2013 a day No 10 had set aside for Sajid Javid\u2019s spending review, with its many promises to increase funding of public services \u2013 purged MPs rose one after another to decry the gradual disintegration of a once-tolerant and internationalist Conservative party.</p> <p>There was defiance and dark humour. Soames was emotional and scathing in turns, saying he was sad his long career as a Conservative MP was ending in this way, before noting that Johnson\u2019s \u201cserial disloyalty\u201d in the past \u201chad been such an inspiration to many of us\u201d. Burt asked \u201cif we are being purged now, who is next?\u201d and vowed that the anti-EU obsessions his party had developed \u201cmay have curtailed my future but it will not rob me of what I believe. I will walk out of here looking up at the sky, not at my shoes.\u201d</p> <p>That evening\u2019s first vote on the \u201cBenn bill\u201d passed at 7pm by 327 and 299. Barring problems in the Lords it was heading on to the statute book.</p> <p>On only the second day of parliamentary business under Johnson\u2019s premiership he had suffered two defeats and lost his majority. Ian Blackford, leader of the SNP at Westminster, observed that \u201cthis must be the shortest-lived honeymoon in parliamentary history\u201d.</p> <p>Incredibly, some Conservatives went further, predicting that Johnson was cornered and could be finished as PM. He had promised never to extend the Brexit deadline but had failed to stop a new law being passed that was about to force him to do so. \u201cI don\u2019t like to say this, and I hardly dare, but I think it could be checkmate,\u201d said one of the leading Tory rebels.</p> <p>He was right to be cautious. Johnson, Cummings, and No 10\u2019s head of legislative affairs, Nikki da Costa, might not have succeeded yet, but they had another scheme up their sleeves which they believed would still scupper the rebel plans.</p> <p>At 7.51pm on Wednesday, Johnson rose in the Commons <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/boris-johnson-suffers-commons-defeat-as-tories-turn-against-him\" title=\"\">to move a motion</a> \u201cthat there shall be an early general election\u201d on 15 October. If parliament were to vote in favour in sufficient numbers, and the Tories were to win the election with a big enough majority, Johnson could then repeal the Benn bill and avoid having to ask for an extension. The pressure, it seemed, was on the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>Johnson told MPs it would be unthinkable for the Labour party leader to refuse a chance to go to the country. \u201cHe has demanded an election for two years while blocking Brexit. He said only two days ago that he would support an election...is he now going to say the public cannot be allowed an election to decide which of us sorts out this mess?\u201d Labour and the other opposition parties, including the SNP, had, however, agreed their lines. They would back a general election \u2013 but not on Johnson\u2019s terms and not on 15 October.</p> <p>Instead they would vote against the motion and say an election should be called when the Benn bill had received royal assent or, better still, when Johnson had actually asked the EU for an extension. Corbyn responded to the election call with mockery. \u201cThe offer of the election today is a bit like the offer of an apple to Snow White from the Wicked Queen, because what the Prime Minister is offering is not an apple or even an election, but the poison of no deal.\u201d</p> <p>To force an election, Johnson needed a two-thirds majority of all MPs to back him. But Labour MPs abstained en masse. The result when it came at 9.21pm was 298 in favour and 56 against. The election ploy had failed, Johnson had lost again, and everyone wondered what on earth he could do next. In the early hours of the next day \u2013 Thursday \u2013 exhausted peers who were opposed to the Benn bill<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/05/thursday-briefing-peers-shut-down-tory-filibuster-of-bill-to-stop-no-deal\" title=\"\"> gave up their attempts at filibustering </a>in the House of Lords and the last hurdle in the way of the Benn bill had been cleared. It is expected to gain royal assent early this week.</p> <p>The headlines in the Tory-supporting papers tore into Corbyn. The <em>Daily Mail</em> declared: \u201cCorbyn chickens out of an election\u201d. But it was the prime minister who was in far deeper trouble. And things were to get worse. Shortly after 11pm, the prime minister\u2019s brother Jo, a Remainer, resigned from the cabinet, saying he had been \u201ctorn between family loyalty and the national interest\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b1e856cf79d7cdbf4c762c65ef7610e9553841f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1e856cf79d7cdbf4c762c65ef7610e9553841f2/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnson speaking in West Yorkshire on Thursday; he was criticised for using police cadets for political purposes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnson speaking in West Yorkshire on Thursday; he was criticised for using police cadets for political purposes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On a visit to Morley, in West Yorkshire, the prime minister was harangued in front of TV cameras by residents, with one accusing him of \u201cplaying games\u201d when he \u201cshould be in Brussels negotiating\u201d, and another telling him: \u201cPlease leave my town\u201d. On the same trip north he gave speech in Wakefield, with rows of police cadets lined up behind, declaring that he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than ask for an extension to the UK\u2019s EU membership. The decision to use police cadets for political purposes was widely criticised as senior Tories, including some in the Cabinet, called for a change of strategy. At a dinner that night, the former Conservative prime minister John Major called on Johnson to \u201cget rid\u201d of Cummings and reinstate the MPs he had suspended, without whom \u201cwe will cease to be a broad-based national party, and be seen as a mean-minded sect\u201d.</p> <p>This weekend, Johnson and his advisers suffered another blow: Amber Rudd quit as work and pensions secretary and resigned the Tory whip. She cited the same concerns that Gauke\u2019s rebels had raised, that she no longer believed Johnson wanted to get a deal with the EU. His decision to withdraw the whip from the 21 rebels was \u201can assault on decency and democracy\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"59a600783d0a298e899d6de7fecc998c51dcdda4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59a600783d0a298e899d6de7fecc998c51dcdda4/509_0_978_1222/800.jpg\" alt=\"Amber Rudd\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amber Rudd resigned as work and pensions secretary and quit the Tory whip on Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They are desperate to find ways to trigger a general election in which they can attack Labour and the other opposition parties for blocking the \u201cwill of the people\u201d. Polls this weekend, including the latest Opinium survey for the <em>Observer</em>, showing a 10-point lead for the Conservatives, will encourage them to hang on and fight.</p> <p>No 10 insists that the prime minister will neither resign nor ask for an extension to Brexit. But doing neither would mean Johnson being in contempt of court and having to quit, say lawyers.</p> <p>There are suggestions that he will try on Monday to call a vote of no confidence in his own government in an attempt to force a general election, and ask Tory MPs to back that motion. But would the speaker, John Bercow, allow such a move that was clearly aimed at achieving a purpose other than that stated in the motion itself? Another idea floated by sources close to Johnson yesterday was that he would try to force the EU to expel the UK by refusing to nominate a commissioner, a ploy Downing Street seems to think would bring the EU to its knees \u2013 but which Brussels insists would not work.</p> <p>After a week of such drama culminating in Rudd\u2019s resignation, MPs have no idea what will unfold next. \u201cWe just have to wait and see what the latest genius plans are from No 10,\u201d said a senior Labour figure. \u201cIf they are as disastrous as those they tried over the last few days, I don\u2019t see how he can survive.</p> <p>\u201cBut what do I know? What does anyone know?\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "At 11am last Tuesday a group of senior Tory MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit gathered outside the cabinet room at No 10 for a meeting with the prime minister. The former chancellor Philip Hammond, the ex-justice secretary David Gauke and the former business secretary Greg Clark were among them. Along with other Tory MPs, including Sir Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve, and Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer and Hilary Benn, they had spent their summer holidays drawing up a bill they believed would force Boris Johnson to seek an extension to Brexit if he could not strike a new deal with the EU by mid-October. Johnson had insisted before and since becoming prime minister that he would never ask the EU for another postponement and would take the UK out of the EU on 31 October \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d, \u201cdo or die\u201d. To limit the amount of parliamentary time the rebels would have to pass the bill, the prime minister had already announced he would shut parliament down for five weeks from next week ahead of a new Queen\u2019s speech on 14 October. But the cross-party alliance opposed to no deal had moved fast in response, and accelerated their plans. As they chatted before the meeting, they were confident they had both the numbers to get the bill on the statute book and the time to do so before parliament was closed. Outside in Whitehall, and down the road in Parliament Square, a constant din of protest and counter-protest rang out from Remainers and Leavers alike. It was parliament\u2019s first day back after the long July and August recess \u2013 and the controversial prorogation announcement. Police had separated people on different sides of the Brexit divide as best they could but still arguments broke out between them on the pavement. Remainers chanted \u201cstop the coup\u201d while Leavers carried banners saying \u201cTraitor Parliament\u201d and \u201cBoris. No Deal is Ideal\u201d. Opposite the entrance to the Commons one of the protesters, Dr John Dinnen, said he had woken up at 2am so worried about what Brexit would mean for peace on the island of Ireland, where he was born, that he had decided to get a train from Hereford to protest about a possible no deal. \u201cI feel very strongly about it,\u201d he said. When the No 10 meeting got under way, the former Tory ministers \u2013 members of the so-called Gaukeward Squad \u2013 asked Johnson what proposals he had to break the deadlock with Brussels and secure a new agreement to stop the UK crashing out in less than two months\u2019 time. If he really had such a plan, and it proved acceptable to the EU and parliament, they made clear that their efforts to force him to go to Brussels to ask for another delay would be unnecessary and everyone would be happy. \u201cHe had a folder on the desk with him and pointed at it, suggesting the plans were inside,\u201d said one source at the meeting. The MPs then inquired whether the folder\u2019s contents had been presented to EU leaders. \u201cHis response was that the EU would only really begin negotiating in earnest when it was sure the UK was serious about no deal,\u201d said another source. \u201cAnd the PM was clear the EU was not yet sure that we were serious about no deal so nothing had been sent to them yet.\u201d The message Johnson wanted to convey was that the MPs\u2019 attempts to block no deal were taking the heat off Brussels. During an hour of discussions, Clark asked for some specific details on particular issues and Johnson said someone from his office would get back to him. Later that day, Clark received a phone call from Johnson\u2019s closest aide, Dominic Cummings, which failed to provide answers. Instead Clark found himself on the end of a foul-mouthed tirade. According to sources aware of the exchange, Cummings bawled at him, saying: \u201cWhen are you MPs going to realise that we are leaving on 31 October?\u201d before adding: \u201cWe are going to fucking purge you.\u201d Just a few hours after the meeting, Johnson made his first speech in the chamber as prime minister. Reporting on the G7 summit in Biarritz, he struck a different tone about the Brexit talks. \u201cIt is simply not true to say we are not making progress,\u201d he said. \u201cI returned from the G7 with real momentum in the Brexit discussions.\u201d This ran contrary not only to the impression he had given to rebel MPs earlier, but also to a report that day in the Daily Telegraph which had quoted Cummings as having admitted in a private meeting that negotiations with the EU were \u201ca sham\u201d. As Johnson spoke, the Tory MP Phillip Lee, a Remainer, crossed the floor of the house to join the Liberal Democrats on the opposition benches. In an instant Johnson had lost his majority; his ability to govern was draining away. Lee and the rebels could see that the Prime Minister was putting out one set of messages in private and another in public. \u201cThe only conclusion to be drawn was that he was actually planning for No Deal,\u201d said one of the rebels. Lee wrote in his resignation letter that Brexit had transformed the Conservative party into a \u201cnarrow faction\u201d that had \u201cincreasingly become infected with the twin diseases of populism and English nationalism\u201d. Later, during a debate that evening on the rebel plan to take control of parliamentary business, the leader of the Commons, Jacob-Rees Mogg, reclined on the government frontbench. The image went viral within minutes. He was accused of being \u201ccontemptuous of this house\u201d by the Green MP Caroline Lucas. When the result of the vote on the Tory rebel plan was announced, the opposition benches erupted while Tory Remainers tried to control their glee. The government had lost by 328 to 301 votes. Twenty-one Conservative MPs had defied their party by voting to allow debate on a bill that would force their own prime minister to ask the EU for an extension \u2013 which he had promised over and over again never to do. As MPs left the chamber, the purge Cummings had threatened began. All rebel MPs, including the father of the house, Kenneth Clarke, and Sir Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill, had the whip withdrawn, and were told they would not be allowed to stand as Conservatives at the next election. The veteran Tory MP Roger Gale said Johnson was \u201cin danger of tearing the party apart\u201d and rumours spread that cabinet ministers, including Amber Rudd, were seething and considering how long they could remain in the government. It was clear by the evening that part one of the Johnson/Cummings masterplan - to use prorogation coupled with threats - had not only failed spectacularly but had backfired. One of those who were purged, the former foreign office minister Alistair Burt says: \u201cI have never seen a government strategy so misjudged, nor fail so speedily, as that devised in Downing Street since late July.\u201d The treatment of grandees such as Clarke and Soames had upset Tory MPs of all Brexit persuasions, even some of the most committed Leavers, such as Sir Edward Leigh, who voiced his disquiet at a meeting of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers. The rebels said the behaviour of No 10 was swelling their numbers, not reducing them so had been utterly counter-productive as well as deeply divisive. On the Tory benches on Wednesday \u2013 a day No 10 had set aside for Sajid Javid\u2019s spending review, with its many promises to increase funding of public services \u2013 purged MPs rose one after another to decry the gradual disintegration of a once-tolerant and internationalist Conservative party. There was defiance and dark humour. Soames was emotional and scathing in turns, saying he was sad his long career as a Conservative MP was ending in this way, before noting that Johnson\u2019s \u201cserial disloyalty\u201d in the past \u201chad been such an inspiration to many of us\u201d. Burt asked \u201cif we are being purged now, who is next?\u201d and vowed that the anti-EU obsessions his party had developed \u201cmay have curtailed my future but it will not rob me of what I believe. I will walk out of here looking up at the sky, not at my shoes.\u201d That evening\u2019s first vote on the \u201cBenn bill\u201d passed at 7pm by 327 and 299. Barring problems in the Lords it was heading on to the statute book. On only the second day of parliamentary business under Johnson\u2019s premiership he had suffered two defeats and lost his majority. Ian Blackford, leader of the SNP at Westminster, observed that \u201cthis must be the shortest-lived honeymoon in parliamentary history\u201d. Incredibly, some Conservatives went further, predicting that Johnson was cornered and could be finished as PM. He had promised never to extend the Brexit deadline but had failed to stop a new law being passed that was about to force him to do so. \u201cI don\u2019t like to say this, and I hardly dare, but I think it could be checkmate,\u201d said one of the leading Tory rebels. He was right to be cautious. Johnson, Cummings, and No 10\u2019s head of legislative affairs, Nikki da Costa, might not have succeeded yet, but they had another scheme up their sleeves which they believed would still scupper the rebel plans. At 7.51pm on Wednesday, Johnson rose in the Commons to move a motion \u201cthat there shall be an early general election\u201d on 15 October. If parliament were to vote in favour in sufficient numbers, and the Tories were to win the election with a big enough majority, Johnson could then repeal the Benn bill and avoid having to ask for an extension. The pressure, it seemed, was on the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Johnson told MPs it would be unthinkable for the Labour party leader to refuse a chance to go to the country. \u201cHe has demanded an election for two years while blocking Brexit. He said only two days ago that he would support an election...is he now going to say the public cannot be allowed an election to decide which of us sorts out this mess?\u201d Labour and the other opposition parties, including the SNP, had, however, agreed their lines. They would back a general election \u2013 but not on Johnson\u2019s terms and not on 15 October. Instead they would vote against the motion and say an election should be called when the Benn bill had received royal assent or, better still, when Johnson had actually asked the EU for an extension. Corbyn responded to the election call with mockery. \u201cThe offer of the election today is a bit like the offer of an apple to Snow White from the Wicked Queen, because what the Prime Minister is offering is not an apple or even an election, but the poison of no deal.\u201d To force an election, Johnson needed a two-thirds majority of all MPs to back him. But Labour MPs abstained en masse. The result when it came at 9.21pm was 298 in favour and 56 against. The election ploy had failed, Johnson had lost again, and everyone wondered what on earth he could do next. In the early hours of the next day \u2013 Thursday \u2013 exhausted peers who were opposed to the Benn bill gave up their attempts at filibustering in the House of Lords and the last hurdle in the way of the Benn bill had been cleared. It is expected to gain royal assent early this week. The headlines in the Tory-supporting papers tore into Corbyn. The Daily Mail declared: \u201cCorbyn chickens out of an election\u201d. But it was the prime minister who was in far deeper trouble. And things were to get worse. Shortly after 11pm, the prime minister\u2019s brother Jo, a Remainer, resigned from the cabinet, saying he had been \u201ctorn between family loyalty and the national interest\u201d. On a visit to Morley, in West Yorkshire, the prime minister was harangued in front of TV cameras by residents, with one accusing him of \u201cplaying games\u201d when he \u201cshould be in Brussels negotiating\u201d, and another telling him: \u201cPlease leave my town\u201d. On the same trip north he gave speech in Wakefield, with rows of police cadets lined up behind, declaring that he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than ask for an extension to the UK\u2019s EU membership. The decision to use police cadets for political purposes was widely criticised as senior Tories, including some in the Cabinet, called for a change of strategy. At a dinner that night, the former Conservative prime minister John Major called on Johnson to \u201cget rid\u201d of Cummings and reinstate the MPs he had suspended, without whom \u201cwe will cease to be a broad-based national party, and be seen as a mean-minded sect\u201d. This weekend, Johnson and his advisers suffered another blow: Amber Rudd quit as work and pensions secretary and resigned the Tory whip. She cited the same concerns that Gauke\u2019s rebels had raised, that she no longer believed Johnson wanted to get a deal with the EU. His decision to withdraw the whip from the 21 rebels was \u201can assault on decency and democracy\u201d. They are desperate to find ways to trigger a general election in which they can attack Labour and the other opposition parties for blocking the \u201cwill of the people\u201d. Polls this weekend, including the latest Opinium survey for the Observer, showing a 10-point lead for the Conservatives, will encourage them to hang on and fight. No 10 insists that the prime minister will neither resign nor ask for an extension to Brexit. But doing neither would mean Johnson being in contempt of court and having to quit, say lawyers. There are suggestions that he will try on Monday to call a vote of no confidence in his own government in an attempt to force a general election, and ask Tory MPs to back that motion. But would the speaker, John Bercow, allow such a move that was clearly aimed at achieving a purpose other than that stated in the motion itself? Another idea floated by sources close to Johnson yesterday was that he would try to force the EU to expel the UK by refusing to nominate a commissioner, a ploy Downing Street seems to think would bring the EU to its knees \u2013 but which Brussels insists would not work. After a week of such drama culminating in Rudd\u2019s resignation, MPs have no idea what will unfold next. \u201cWe just have to wait and see what the latest genius plans are from No 10,\u201d said a senior Labour figure. \u201cIf they are as disastrous as those they tried over the last few days, I don\u2019t see how he can survive. \u201cBut what do I know? What does anyone know?\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u201cA no-deal Brexit could cause far more damage to our future economic success than a Corbyn government, the former chancellor Ken Clarke told the <em>Observer</em> this weekend.</p> \n<p>It is an extraordinary sign that the Conservative party has imploded beyond the point of no return that someone who until days ago was its longest-serving MP would now rather see not Boris Johnson, but a man whose politics he has staunchly opposed for decades as prime minister. The party\u2019s crisis was compounded last night by cabinet minister Amber Rudd resigning the Conservative whip. \u201cI cannot stand by as good, moderate Conservatives are expelled,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Any Tory who feels a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/07/sir-nicholas-soames-says-tories-started-resembling-brexit-sect-boris-johnson-jacob-rees-mogg\" title=\"\">shred of responsibility</a> to the country should agree with Clarke and Rudd. This state of affairs is the inevitable consequence of Johnson\u2019s strategy to smash up and reinvent his party in the image of Nigel Farage. Hence his pledge to take us out of the EU on 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d, despite the vanishingly small prospect of a negotiated deal. He is willing to sacrifice his party, plunge the country into economic crisis and risk the union so long as it keeps him clinging to the reins of power. But in behaving as though he could ride roughshod over our sovereign parliament, Johnson has miscalculated. In proroguing parliament for five weeks as Britain experiences its worst political crisis in living memory, he galvanised the parliamentary opposition to no deal. In threatening rebels in his own party with immediate expulsion should they try to prevent no deal, he destroyed his own working majority. In trying to force a quickfire election to his own tactical advantage, but to the detriment of the country, he has encouraged unity among his opponents.</p> \n<p>Parliament has finally exerted itself, as it always had the power to do. And so a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/boris-johnson-short-of-options-as-rebels-vow-to-secure-brexit-delay\">terrible week for Johnson</a> has been a good week for Jeremy Corbyn, who appeared prime ministerial where Johnson did not. The 21 Conservative rebels who put the national interest ahead of party and career in voting for the extension bill deserve credit and respect, as does Jo Johnson. Those ministers who have spent months warning of the dangers of no deal but who continue to prop up Boris Johnson should follow his lead.</p> \n<p>But none of last week\u2019s drama changes the fundamental reality that politics is as gridlocked as ever. While parliament is opposed to no deal, there is no majority in favour of anything constructive. The <em>Observer</em> has long argued that a referendum on a negotiated exit versus the status quo is ultimately the only way to resolve this. Asking voters to decide only on the basis of a yes/no question, with no concrete Brexit plan on the table, could never have imbued a vote to leave the EU with sufficient democratic legitimacy. The fact that parliament has repeatedly rejected the withdrawal agreement, which contained all the real-world trade-offs that the Leave campaigns denied ever existed, only provides further impetus. But there is currently no parliamentary majority for a referendum either. The only way out of this bind is a general election.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1681586e-6c8a-4420-8811-083fbaab2c8e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jkJgcq2Lvw4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Any general election will inevitably be treated as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/07/boris-johnson-prime-minister-toxic-voters\" title=\"\">quasi-referendum</a>, however. So it must be held at a time that allows for as considered a debate as possible, not rushed through because it is to Johnson\u2019s political advantage. Corbyn is absolutely right that now parliament has mandated the prime minister to ask for a three-month article 50 extension if he cannot agree a deal, the election should be called only once that extension has been requested. We live in a parliamentary democracy, where a prime minister\u2019s authority to govern derives solely from parliament. If Johnson cannot bring himself to obey the law it has just passed, he must resign to make way for someone who will.</p> \n<p>The quasi-referendum status of a forthcoming election means it is vital voters are offered a clear choice. That is much harder in an election, where the two main parties are split on Brexit, than in a referendum. Labour\u2019s position \u2013 that it would negotiate its own Brexit deal, put that to a referendum and allow its MPs to campaign whichever way they wished \u2013 falls far short.

      "bodyText": "\u201cA no-deal Brexit could cause far more damage to our future economic success than a Corbyn government, the former chancellor Ken Clarke told the Observer this weekend. It is an extraordinary sign that the Conservative party has imploded beyond the point of no return that someone who until days ago was its longest-serving MP would now rather see not Boris Johnson, but a man whose politics he has staunchly opposed for decades as prime minister. The party\u2019s crisis was compounded last night by cabinet minister Amber Rudd resigning the Conservative whip. \u201cI cannot stand by as good, moderate Conservatives are expelled,\u201d she said. Any Tory who feels a shred of responsibility to the country should agree with Clarke and Rudd. This state of affairs is the inevitable consequence of Johnson\u2019s strategy to smash up and reinvent his party in the image of Nigel Farage. Hence his pledge to take us out of the EU on 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d, despite the vanishingly small prospect of a negotiated deal. He is willing to sacrifice his party, plunge the country into economic crisis and risk the union so long as it keeps him clinging to the reins of power. But in behaving as though he could ride roughshod over our sovereign parliament, Johnson has miscalculated. In proroguing parliament for five weeks as Britain experiences its worst political crisis in living memory, he galvanised the parliamentary opposition to no deal. In threatening rebels in his own party with immediate expulsion should they try to prevent no deal, he destroyed his own working majority. In trying to force a quickfire election to his own tactical advantage, but to the detriment of the country, he has encouraged unity among his opponents. Parliament has finally exerted itself, as it always had the power to do. And so a terrible week for Johnson has been a good week for Jeremy Corbyn, who appeared prime ministerial where Johnson did not. The 21 Conservative rebels who put the national interest ahead of party and career in voting for the extension bill deserve credit and respect, as does Jo Johnson. Those ministers who have spent months warning of the dangers of no deal but who continue to prop up Boris Johnson should follow his lead. But none of last week\u2019s drama changes the fundamental reality that politics is as gridlocked as ever. While parliament is opposed to no deal, there is no majority in favour of anything constructive. The Observer has long argued that a referendum on a negotiated exit versus the status quo is ultimately the only way to resolve this. Asking voters to decide only on the basis of a yes/no question, with no concrete Brexit plan on the table, could never have imbued a vote to leave the EU with sufficient democratic legitimacy. The fact that parliament has repeatedly rejected the withdrawal agreement, which contained all the real-world trade-offs that the Leave campaigns denied ever existed, only provides further impetus. But there is currently no parliamentary majority for a referendum either. The only way out of this bind is a general election. Any general election will inevitably be treated as a quasi-referendum, however. So it must be held at a time that allows for as considered a debate as possible, not rushed through because it is to Johnson\u2019s political advantage. Corbyn is absolutely right that now parliament has mandated the prime minister to ask for a three-month article 50 extension if he cannot agree a deal, the election should be called only once that extension has been requested. We live in a parliamentary democracy, where a prime minister\u2019s authority to govern derives solely from parliament. If Johnson cannot bring himself to obey the law it has just passed, he must resign to make way for someone who will. The quasi-referendum status of a forthcoming election means it is vital voters are offered a clear choice. That is much harder in an election, where the two main parties are split on Brexit, than in a referendum. Labour\u2019s position \u2013 that it would negotiate its own Brexit deal, put that to a referendum and allow its MPs to campaign whichever way they wished \u2013 falls far short. It means that a vote for Labour could be interpreted both as a vote for Brexit and a vote to remain in the EU. The options facing the country are clear: staying in the EU; a soft, Norway-style Brexit that includes signing up to free movement; a hard Brexit with an Irish backstop; or no deal. It is disingenuous for Labour to avoid saying which of these four options it is for in a doomed attempt to keep all its voters happy. Corbyn must be clear that if Labour were to be elected it would put the withdrawal deal, which allows for a wide range of different Brexits as a final destination, to a referendum against the status quo and that Labour would campaign to remain in the EU. This will be a general election like no other, to determine the way forward on a question that cuts across traditional party divides. It would be a travesty if it returned a majority for the pro-Brexit parties despite more people voting for pro-referendum parties. The best way to avoid this is to maximise the anti-Brexit seat share through efforts to encourage people to vote tactically and candidates stepping aside where there is another pro-referendum candidate better placed to win. The stakes have never been higher. Britain\u2019s economic wellbeing and the future of the union hang in the balance. Voters deserve a clear choice.",
