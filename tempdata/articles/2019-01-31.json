      "body": "<p>Thousands of deaths and the wrecking of many lives by disability could be averted if doctors routinely offered a daily statin pill to older people, scientists say.</p> <p>They blame misinformation about the side-effects of statins, together with society\u2019s ageism, for the low uptake among older people, who are at highest risk of heart attacks, heart failure and stroke.</p> <p>There are 5.5 million people aged over 75 in the UK, of whom about 1.5 million take a statin. If the rest did so too, about 8,000 additional deaths from cardiovascular events could be prevented, said Prof Colin Baigent, director of the Medical Research Council population health research unit at Oxford University.</p> <p>More than two-thirds of the 150,000 cardiovascular deaths in the UK each year are in people over 75.</p> <p>Baigent said there were good reasons why some would not want to take statins, for instance if they had terminal cancer or certain other medical conditions, but the pills were safe and effective and should be offered. </p> <p>\u201cIt is not just about preventing deaths,\u201d he said. \u201cDeath is the least of people\u2019s worries when they are elderly. They are more worried about being disabled. Talking to elderly relatives, it is the thing they want to avoid.\u201d He said disability following stroke and heart failure could massively impair people\u2019s quality of life.</p> <p>Baigent said statins had wrongly become controversial because of misinformation about side-effects. \u201cWe have people saying that 20% of those taking a statin get side-effects, which is clear misinformation. It is fake news,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seen, as a result of that, a lot of concern about people being on too much treatment, but it is predicated on the idea that it is doing them harm. That is misinformation.\u201d</p> <p>The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists\u2019 Collaboration, a project based at Oxford University, has collected data from clinical trials of statins involving 200,000 patients over the last 25 years. Baigent said researchers know what the rare, big hazards of statins are, such as myopathy, which causes muscle weakness.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of deaths and the wrecking of many lives by disability could be averted if doctors routinely offered a daily statin pill to older people, scientists say. They blame misinformation about the side-effects of statins, together with society\u2019s ageism, for the low uptake among older people, who are at highest risk of heart attacks, heart failure and stroke. There are 5.5 million people aged over 75 in the UK, of whom about 1.5 million take a statin. If the rest did so too, about 8,000 additional deaths from cardiovascular events could be prevented, said Prof Colin Baigent, director of the Medical Research Council population health research unit at Oxford University. More than two-thirds of the 150,000 cardiovascular deaths in the UK each year are in people over 75. Baigent said there were good reasons why some would not want to take statins, for instance if they had terminal cancer or certain other medical conditions, but the pills were safe and effective and should be offered. \u201cIt is not just about preventing deaths,\u201d he said. \u201cDeath is the least of people\u2019s worries when they are elderly. They are more worried about being disabled. Talking to elderly relatives, it is the thing they want to avoid.\u201d He said disability following stroke and heart failure could massively impair people\u2019s quality of life. Baigent said statins had wrongly become controversial because of misinformation about side-effects. \u201cWe have people saying that 20% of those taking a statin get side-effects, which is clear misinformation. It is fake news,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seen, as a result of that, a lot of concern about people being on too much treatment, but it is predicated on the idea that it is doing them harm. That is misinformation.\u201d The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists\u2019 Collaboration, a project based at Oxford University, has collected data from clinical trials of statins involving 200,000 patients over the last 25 years. Baigent said researchers know what the rare, big hazards of statins are, such as myopathy, which causes muscle weakness. Because of the concerns, they are now examining the data on side-effects and will report probably at the end of the year. \u201cIt is very unlikely that any hazards exist that we don\u2019t already know about,\u201d Baigent said. \u201cThe debate about whether statins are associated with particular hazards has got out of control and is blinding us to the clear evidence that we already have.\u201d People have become muddled by claims of side-effects based not on randomised controlled trials but on observational studies \u2013 the reports of patients who know what drug they are taking and assume any pains they feel are down to the pills. \u201cNon-randomised studies are extremely susceptible to bias,\u201d Baigent said. \u201cThey are extremely unreliable.\u201d He said ageism among doctors and society as a whole was also preventing older people from being offered statins. There was an attitude that \u201ca person is elderly, so something is going to happen to them, so why bother?\u201d The collaboration analysed data from 28 randomised controlled trials involving a total of 186,854 patients, 14,483 of whom were aged over 75. The findings are published in the Lancet medical journal. Statins reduce the levels of LDL, or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol, in the blood, measured in millimoles per litre. The study found that for every reduction of 1mmol/L, the risk of a cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke) dropped by a fifth across all age groups. The risk reduction was lower in the over 75s than in younger people but still a substantial benefit, the scientists said, because older people are at higher risk. \u201cEven if risk reduction in people older than 75 years is less than expected, statin therapy may still be justified by a high baseline cardiovascular risk, which is usually present in older people,\u201d writes Bernard Cheung, of the Queen Mary hospital at the University of Hong Kong, in a comment article in the journal. \u201cThe present meta-analysis makes a case to reduce LDL cholesterol in people at risk of cardiovascular events regardless of age, provided that the benefits outweigh the risks and the patient accepts long term treatment.\u201d Prof Sir Nilesh Samani, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: \u201cConcern has been raised about the benefits of statins in older people.

The club wanted me to start right away [a month ago, when the appointment was announced] but I explained the issues I had to the chairman and he understood.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/20/sheffield-wednesday-owner-dejphon-chansiri-tells-fans-club-up-for-sale\">Sheffield Wednesday owner Dejphon Chansiri tells fans club is up for sale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bruce had promised his wife he would take a break from football following his sacking as the Aston Villa manager and the death of his parents last year, and has just returned from a month\u2019s holiday in the Caribbean. He was criticised for not returning earlier by the television pundit Danny Murphy, who later apologised for not knowing the facts. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me any more,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cPeople are very quick to criticise now, even if they don\u2019t know the whole story.\u201d</p> <p>The former Manchester United captain had such an unhappy experience in his last job he admitted he had to think about whether he wanted to return to management. He found his enthusiasm returning once Wednesday got in touch, even though they presently languish in 17th place in the Championship.</p> <p>\u201cI thought long and hard about whether I wanted another job but when the phone call came I discovered I was ready to get back on the horse again,\u201d the 58-year-old said. \u201cWhen the call came [from the Wednesday chairman, Dejphon Chansiri] I thought, well, I have to go and meet the guy. He is an eccentric character but deep down he wants the club to do well. I think it\u2019s all a bluff that he wants to sell it but with all its history, tradition and support it didn\u2019t need much selling to me.\u201d</p> <p>Joking apart, Bruce had a couple of medical problems last year and had to reassure himself that taking charge of another sleeping giant in the Championship would not be bad for his health. \u201cI had to have my knee washed out and a mole taken off my eye but I\u2019ve had all the checks now, the full MOT if you like and I\u2019m perfectly fine,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a good overhaul and I\u2019m ready to go.</p> <p>\u201cI admit I was uncertain about whether I wanted a 10th job but I never thought I\u2019d be in a position like I was at Aston Villa, where we weren\u2019t going to get paid on a Friday. That\u2019s how bad it was, it all looks great from the outside, but after being there four months I was told I had to raise \u00a325m, which we did, and still mount a play\u2011off challenge, which we did.</p> <p>\u201cAfter we lost the play-off final it became clear the state the club was in. It was difficult, because when your chief executive gets the sack, then your director of football, you can\u2019t help but think you are going to be next. We had huge financial problems for months.\u201d</p> <p>Bruce accepts it will be hard to bridge the gap to the play-offs with Wednesday but he is willing to give it a try. \u201cIf I can get us up I won\u2019t be going anywhere,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cHopefully I\u2019d like to stay here for three, four or five years and that\u2019ll be enough. I still have the necessary drive and commitment, I wouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t think I could turn the club around and make the supporters happy again. This is a big club with all the bits and pieces to be in the Premier League, and that\u2019s where we all want to take it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a long road ahead but there are some good players here who have probably been underperforming. I asked the chairman about the budget and he said there isn\u2019t one, so we all know where we stand. I know the club has been operating under financial fair play restrictions, but so were Villa. It\u2019s difficult for big clubs in the Championship if they no longer receive parachute payments but hopefully I can bring my experience to bear and try to find ways of improving [us].</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not always about money, we got Hull promoted with a collection of loans and waifs and strays. I can\u2019t wait to get started, I\u2019ve just been to meet the players and I don\u2019t think I could have picked a colder day, especially coming back from the Caribbean. Even that was exciting though, I had butterflies. I feel like a young kid going to school again.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Steve Bruce is back where he started in management but on the opposite side of the city\u2019s divide, claiming his formative years at Sheffield United were too long ago to affect his new job with Wednesday. \u201cThat was my first managerial job and this might be my last,\u201d the former Sunderland and Birmingham manager said of his 10th club since retiring from playing. \u201cPhysically and emotionally I feel great. The club wanted me to start right away [a month ago, when the appointment was announced] but I explained the issues I had to the chairman and he understood.\u201d Bruce had promised his wife he would take a break from football following his sacking as the Aston Villa manager and the death of his parents last year, and has just returned from a month\u2019s holiday in the Caribbean. He was criticised for not returning earlier by the television pundit Danny Murphy, who later apologised for not knowing the facts. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me any more,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cPeople are very quick to criticise now, even if they don\u2019t know the whole story.\u201d The former Manchester United captain had such an unhappy experience in his last job he admitted he had to think about whether he wanted to return to management. He found his enthusiasm returning once Wednesday got in touch, even though they presently languish in 17th place in the Championship. \u201cI thought long and hard about whether I wanted another job but when the phone call came I discovered I was ready to get back on the horse again,\u201d the 58-year-old said. \u201cWhen the call came [from the Wednesday chairman, Dejphon Chansiri] I thought, well, I have to go and meet the guy. He is an eccentric character but deep down he wants the club to do well. I think it\u2019s all a bluff that he wants to sell it but with all its history, tradition and support it didn\u2019t need much selling to me.\u201d Joking apart, Bruce had a couple of medical problems last year and had to reassure himself that taking charge of another sleeping giant in the Championship would not be bad for his health. \u201cI had to have my knee washed out and a mole taken off my eye but I\u2019ve had all the checks now, the full MOT if you like and I\u2019m perfectly fine,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a good overhaul and I\u2019m ready to go. \u201cI admit I was uncertain about whether I wanted a 10th job but I never thought I\u2019d be in a position like I was at Aston Villa, where we weren\u2019t going to get paid on a Friday. That\u2019s how bad it was, it all looks great from the outside, but after being there four months I was told I had to raise \u00a325m, which we did, and still mount a play\u2011off challenge, which we did. \u201cAfter we lost the play-off final it became clear the state the club was in. It was difficult, because when your chief executive gets the sack, then your director of football, you can\u2019t help but think you are going to be next. We had huge financial problems for months.\u201d Bruce accepts it will be hard to bridge the gap to the play-offs with Wednesday but he is willing to give it a try. \u201cIf I can get us up I won\u2019t be going anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully I\u2019d like to stay here for three, four or five years and that\u2019ll be enough. I still have the necessary drive and commitment, I wouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t think I could turn the club around and make the supporters happy again. This is a big club with all the bits and pieces to be in the Premier League, and that\u2019s where we all want to take it. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long road ahead but there are some good players here who have probably been underperforming. I asked the chairman about the budget and he said there isn\u2019t one, so we all know where we stand. I know the club has been operating under financial fair play restrictions, but so were Villa. It\u2019s difficult for big clubs in the Championship if they no longer receive parachute payments but hopefully I can bring my experience to bear and try to find ways of improving [us]. \u201cIt\u2019s not always about money, we got Hull promoted with a collection of loans and waifs and strays. I can\u2019t wait to get started, I\u2019ve just been to meet the players and I don\u2019t think I could have picked a colder day, especially coming back from the Caribbean. Even that was exciting though, I had butterflies. I feel like a young kid going to school again.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The victims and grieving relatives of a Canadian truck crash, in which 16 people died, will have to wait until March to learn the driver\u2019s sentence. Following an emotionally charged week of victim impact statements, the judge overseeing the case has asked for nearly two months to consider how to sentence the driver, Jaskirat Singh Sidhu. On 6 April last year, his semi-trailer truck collided with the bus of the Humboldt Broncos hockey team after he failed to stop at an intersection in central Saskatchewan. Sidhu had previously pleaded guilty to all 29 charges he faced \u2014 including 16 counts of dangerous driving causing death. Young hockey players, coaches, a trainer and a radio announcer were among those killed. The crown had asked for a 10-year prison sentence and a further 10 years of suspended driving. As part of the sentencing, 75 written victim impact statements were submitted to the court, with 65 read by friends and family over a four-day period. Some included grim details of the parents being unable to fully identify their children \u2013 and the tragic extent of some injuries. \u201cI will not get to watch him experience the joys of being a father \u2026 the list of things we will not experience with him will never end,\u201d Logan Boulet\u2019s father, Toby, told the gymnasium-turned-courtroom in Melfort, Saskatchewan. \u201cI just want to hold my boy \u2026 I hurt everywhere.\u201d Some of those who survived the crash were left with severe injuries, including two who remain paralysed. Kaleb Dahlgren\u2019s skull was fractured and six vertebrae in his neck and back were broken, Dahlgren\u2019s father Mark told reporters. \u201cI hope that Mr Sidhu is able to hear about how wonderful the people were that were involved in the accident \u2013 the people that survived and the people that passed away,\u201d he said. In a near-miraculous turn of events, Dahlgren made a full recovery and recently signed to play hockey for York Lions at York University in Toronto, Ontario. Some chose to forgive Sidhu, arguing that he likely carries the heavy burden of seeing the devastation caused by his recklessness. \u201cI have been forgiven for things I didn\u2019t deserve, and I will forgive you the same,\u201d said Christina Haugan, who lost her husband, Darcy, the Bronco\u2019s head coach. Others were less charitable. \u201cAll of this grief was caused by you,\u201d said Jaxon Joseph\u2019s mother, Andrea, calling Sidhu an \u201carrogant and inconsiderate monster\u201d for his failure to stop despite multiple road signs. The hearing also revealed new information about the accident. Sidhu had accumulated 70 violations of federal and provincial trucking regulations in the days leading up to the crash \u2013 meaning he should not have been allowed on the road at the time of the accident, according to documents presented in court. He had only been driving trucks for three weeks prior to the crash, and the week of the crash was his first time alone on the highway. \u201cIf Jaskirat Singh Sidhu had been stopped and inspected on April 6 2018 prior to the incident, he would have been placed under a 72-hour out of service declaration \u2026 preventing him from operating a commercial vehicle,\u201d the report said. Among those violations were repeated failures to account for time spent driving and location of breaks, meant to prevent driver fatigue. Prior to the accident, Sidhu was not drunk, high or distracted when he failed to stop, nor was he speeding when he ran through a stop sign, according to the statement of facts. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine what you guys are going through, or what you have been through,\u201d Sidhu told the families of victims and the court, at times breaking down. \u201cI have taken the most valuable things of your life.\u201d \u201cI feel you have remorse for your actions \u2026 I don\u2019t think you are a terrible person \u2026 I think you were grossly unqualified to be in the road that day,\u201d said Chris Joseph, Jaxon Joseph\u2019s father, told Sidhu earlier in the week. \u201cI hope I find forgiveness.

It\u2019s an attempt at something artful and opaque yet wrapped in a slick, glossy package, a film that thinks it has something on its mind but is actually terminally vacant. It\u2019s a strange career swerve for British-Iranian writer-director Babak Anvari, who impressed so many with his first feature, the effectively restrained ghost story Under the Shadow, a film constructed with a careful finesse that\u2019s sadly absent here. Based on a novella by Nathan Ballingrud, the film focuses on Will (Armie Hammer), a bartender who enjoys his job just a little too much, preferring to drink with his regulars rather than spend time with girlfriend Carrie (Dakota Johnson).</p> <p>One night, after a particularly violent brawl, Will finds a cellphone left on the floor.

      "bodyText": "During my particular screening of Wounds at this year\u2019s Sundance film festival, there was an added in-cinema soundtrack. Certain reactions are to be expected when watching a button-pushing horror, from gasps to screams to nervous laughter following a deviously employed jump scare, but others are less desirable, unintentional mockery or incredulity the sign of a major misstep. The audience was as audibly unsure and exhausted with what was on-screen as I was, a confused, haphazard jumble of ideas, gore and tone, a misfiring curio set to befuddle and disappoint when it finally gets released. It\u2019s an attempt at something artful and opaque yet wrapped in a slick, glossy package, a film that thinks it has something on its mind but is actually terminally vacant. It\u2019s a strange career swerve for British-Iranian writer-director Babak Anvari, who impressed so many with his first feature, the effectively restrained ghost story Under the Shadow, a film constructed with a careful finesse that\u2019s sadly absent here. Based on a novella by Nathan Ballingrud, the film focuses on Will (Armie Hammer), a bartender who enjoys his job just a little too much, preferring to drink with his regulars rather than spend time with girlfriend Carrie (Dakota Johnson). One night, after a particularly violent brawl, Will finds a cellphone left on the floor. He takes it home and starts to interact with a string of unsettling messages. Strange things then start to happen, many of them involving cockroaches \u2026 Opening quite pretentiously with a Joseph Conrad quote, Anvari hints at the study of a sociopath, but it\u2019s one of the film\u2019s many half-thought ideas and bar one atrociously written domestic row late in the film, it doesn\u2019t take hold in quite the way that it should.

In the end, it was St Helens who claimed the first bragging rights of 2019, ensuring that Wigan remain on minus two points for at least another week following the revelation on the eve of the season that the champions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/30/wigan-docked-two-points-super-league-salary-cap-breach-rugby-league\" title=\"\">had been found guilty of breaching the salary cap</a> in 2017.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/no-helmets-required/2019/jan/30/super-league-season-kicking-off-style-wigan\">The Super League season is kicking off early \u2013 and in style</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Even after just one game, though, it is clear that the introduction of a shot clock \u2013 aimed at reducing needless stoppages in a game which prides itself on its pace \u2013 is going to go a long way towards having the impact the Super League chief executive, Robert Elstone, craves for the competition. This was about as strong a start to the season as he could have hoped for. \u201cI think it\u2019s the right idea to speed the game up and we\u2019re on the right track,\u201d said the St Helens coach, Justin Holbrook. \u201cEveryone knows what we\u2019ve had to do and it\u2019s great for our game. I\u2019ve said before that the changes will be fantastic for everyone who watches it live this season.\u201d</p> \n<p>Indeed at half-time it seemed that Super League\u2019s other key new ruling for 2019, the golden point extra-time, was a distinct possibility given that the scores were tied at 12 apiece.</p> \n<p>Fittingly, it was one of the headline recruits who struck the first blow of the new season. The Fiji captain, Kevin Naiqama, is one of several big names to arrive in Super League and after three minutes he barged his way over the line. Ten minutes later Saints doubled their lead when a fine break from Dom Peyroux was finished by Jonny Lomax.</p> \n<p>Mark Percival converted both to make it 12-0, but the Warriors soon found their feet.

      "bodyText": "If this is a sign of things to come for the next nine months, then perhaps this truly is a new beginning for Super League after all. In the end, it was St Helens who claimed the first bragging rights of 2019, ensuring that Wigan remain on minus two points for at least another week following the revelation on the eve of the season that the champions had been found guilty of breaching the salary cap in 2017. Even after just one game, though, it is clear that the introduction of a shot clock \u2013 aimed at reducing needless stoppages in a game which prides itself on its pace \u2013 is going to go a long way towards having the impact the Super League chief executive, Robert Elstone, craves for the competition. This was about as strong a start to the season as he could have hoped for. \u201cI think it\u2019s the right idea to speed the game up and we\u2019re on the right track,\u201d said the St Helens coach, Justin Holbrook. \u201cEveryone knows what we\u2019ve had to do and it\u2019s great for our game. I\u2019ve said before that the changes will be fantastic for everyone who watches it live this season.\u201d Indeed at half-time it seemed that Super League\u2019s other key new ruling for 2019, the golden point extra-time, was a distinct possibility given that the scores were tied at 12 apiece. Fittingly, it was one of the headline recruits who struck the first blow of the new season. The Fiji captain, Kevin Naiqama, is one of several big names to arrive in Super League and after three minutes he barged his way over the line. Ten minutes later Saints doubled their lead when a fine break from Dom Peyroux was finished by Jonny Lomax. Mark Percival converted both to make it 12-0, but the Warriors soon found their feet. As half-time approached, Ben Flower crashed over on the angle to halve the deficit before Liam Marshall instinctively picked off a Lachlan Coote pass to race the length of the field. Zak Hardaker \u2013 who had a quiet night on his competitive return to rugby league \u2013 levelled the scores. With defence impressively on top in light of the reduction in interchanges from 10 to eight, the home side went back ahead again when Regan Grace produced an outstanding flying finish in the corner to make it 16-12. There were half-chances for Wigan for the visitors in the closing stages but as the minutes eked away, and the effects of a bruising night began to become visibly apparent on the players, it was the St Helens captain, James Roby, who guaranteed victory, scampering over from dummy half. \u201cAs always, it was a massive effort from Robes,\u201d Holbrook said when asked about the impact of his captain post-match. \u201cYou sort of get used to that happening all the time these days though, don\u2019t you?\u201d New beginnings for Super League but in terms of Roby\u2019s impact some things, it seems, are destined to remain the same.",

Jessica Meeuwig, the director of the Centre for Marine Futures at the University of Western Australia, said in 2014 that Queensland\u2019s shark control has \u201ctaken a large toll on wildlife, while any increase in human safety has been equivocal at best\u201d. Sea Shepherd Australia told the Guardian last year that a survey of drum lines had found they were often left for days without bait, and that they \u201ccreated a false sense of security\u201d for swimmers. \u201cDrum lines were first introduced in the 1960s and, since then, there has been 60 years of progress in technology and our understanding of shark behaviour,\u201d Beynon said. \u201cThere are better ways to protect ocean users that don\u2019t kill our marine wildlife.\u201d Beynon said sharks were often found alive and in distress on drum lines, which were not checked daily. Many species are shot if found alive. Last year, the government responded to two shark attacks at Cid harbour, a site where sharks are known to feed, in the Whitsundays by bringing in temporary drum lines. A spokeswoman for GBRMPA said that under the Marine Park Act and zoning regulations, \u201ca program to take animals that pose a threat to human life or safety and conducting research is allowed with the authority\u2019s permission\u201d. In its decision to renew the government\u2019s approval for shark culling, the authority considered that \u201cgiven the nature, frequency and extent of public access to the marine park ... the risk of a shark attack on a person swimming in the marine park is reasonably foreseeable\u201d. The authority also concluded that there were adequate safeguards in place to protect the environment.",

One pro-Brexit backbencher, John Mann, said he was in talks with civil servants about creating a multibillion investment fund aimed at leave-voting areas following a meeting he and a group of 25 MPs had with the prime minister a fortnight ago. \u201cIt is my belief and not just mine that it will persuade Labour MPs towards the deal,\u201d Mann said. A package focused on job creation would make \u201cit very difficult for Labour MPs in leave areas to vote against the deal unless they want a second referendum\u201d. But Anna Turley, who represents Redcar, said the offer amounted to little more than \u201cbribes or sweeteners\u201d to MPs who signed up to a revised Brexit deal \u201cwhich we know will make those constituencies worse off\u201d. \u201cGiven that the government have taken \u00a36bn out of northern constituencies, is it not time that they held a proper debate on fairer funding for the north, instead of offering bribes and pork barrel politics?\u201d Turley added. No 10 is drawing up a package of measures aimed at wooing Labour MPs into supporting a revised Brexit package, in the belief that a hard core of up to 30 Tory Brexiters will never vote for any deal the prime minister can renegotiate. A Downing Street spokesman would not be drawn on the details of the investment fund that Mann hopes the government will announce as part of the package, which is also expected to include legislation to protect workers\u2019 rights after Brexit. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman added \u201cwe are determined to lead a programme of national renewal, post-Brexit\u201d, saying that May had a long-term commitment to tackle inequalities, and that \u201cno community should feel that they are left behind\u201d. Downing Street rejected the idea that any plan amounted to \u201ccash for votes\u201d, although any investment package would have to be carefully put together as there will be demands from Conservative MPs for greater investment in shire areas and possibly further demands from the Democratic Unionist party who are currently opposed to May\u2019s Brexit deal. Shortly after the 2017 general election, which cost the Conservatives their overall majority, the governing party agreed to fund \u00a31bn of extra investment in Northern Ireland as part of an agreement with the DUP, in which the minor party would support the government in key votes. Senior Labour figures are divided on how to proceed as May struggles. The party is opposed to no deal, and its leadership is not keen on a second referendum, but Jeremy Corbyn has said he would support a deal based on a post-Brexit customs union, a close single-market relationship and enhanced workers\u2019 rights. Some in the shadow cabinet argue that the logic of Corbyn\u2019s position could see Labour eventually working with the government to get a Brexit deal through if the prime minister is willing to compromise over a customs union. But others such as Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, have in the past warned that Labour voters in remain areas would not understand the party reaching any sort of accommodation with the government. Few in Labour seriously believe that May would compromise or that Corbyn could work with her, but there is a view that MPs in leave-supporting areas may not be punished by the leadership if they were to support a revised Brexit deal. Mann was one of 14 MPs who defied a three-line whip on Tuesday night to vote against Yvette Cooper\u2019s amendment aimed at giving parliament more time to avoid a no-deal Brexit. A further 11 abstained. Labour sources said the MPs have been \u201cspoken to in the usual way, and reminded of their obligations to vote with the whip\u201d but not otherwise punished. Nick Brown, the party\u2019s chief whip, has indicated that he would consider how to deal with MPs voting against the leadership line at the end of the Brexit process. When asked about the idea of extra cash for coalfield communities, Corbyn said: \u201cClearly, there has to be investment in those communities \u2013 but the Brexit plan proposed by Theresa May doesn\u2019t solve that any more than the government\u2019s austerity programme is going to solve any of that.\u201d Senior trade union officials also met with civil servants on Thursday lunchtime to discuss plans to legislate to further safeguard workers\u2019 rights after Brexit.

      "bodyText": "A federal judge in Alabama dismissed the appeal of a Muslim death row prisoner for a stay of execution because he was being denied the presence of an imam while he is administered a lethal injection. US district judge Keith Watkins denied the stay on Friday but ruled Alabama must keep a Christian prison chaplain out of the execution chamber. Domineque Ray, who is due to be executed in Alabama Thursday for the murder of teenage girl in 1995, had been told that only the prison chaplain, a Christian, is allowed to be present in the execution chamber. In papers filed at a district court in Alabama earlier this week, Ray\u2019s lawyers argued that the prisoner\u2019s right to free exercise of religion was being violated. The papers said the prison warden refused Ray\u2019s request for an imam to take the place of the chaplain and subsequently refused a request for the chaplain not to be present at the time of execution. Ray, who is described as a \u201cdevout Muslim\u201d in the court papers, was convicted in 1999 of the murder of Tiffany Harville, 15, four years earlier. Her decomposing body was found in a field a month after she disappeared. Ray\u2019s co-defendant in the trial testified that Ray had cut the girl\u2019s throat after the pair raped her, although there was no physical evidence linking Ray to the crime scene. In September 2017, medical records of Ray\u2019s co-defendant were released, showing he had schizophrenia and was suffering from misperceptions of reality, auditory hallucinations and religious delusions at the time of his interrogation and testimony. Death row prisoners in Alabama are permitted to have \u201ccontact visits\u201d, without barriers, with pre-approved family, friends, attorneys and spiritual advisers in the days running up to their scheduled execution. But only the prison chaplain is permitted to be present in the chamber while the execution is carried out. Ray\u2019s lawyers argued that the prisoner would be executed under \u201cconditions that substantially burden the exercise of his religious belief\u201d and violate the first amendment. \u201cThere is no compelling governmental interest in preventing a condemned inmate from having his or her spiritual adviser \u2013 who has been approved to have a contact visit with the condemned inmate in the death watch cell steps away from the execution chamber and moments before the execution begins \u2013 from taking the place of the prison chaplain in the execution chamber,\u201d the court documents said. The chaplain\u2019s \u201cmandatory presence in the execution chamber can serve only one interest \u2013 an unconstitutional one \u2013 safeguarding the soul or spiritual health of the condemned inmate in the Christian belief system\u201d. The chaplain\u2019s presence has \u201cthe principle or primary effect of advancing Christian religion and inhibiting all other religions\u201d. A spokesperson for the department of corrections, said a security protocol \u201conly allows approved correctional officials, that includes the prison\u2019s chaplain, to be inside the chamber where executions are lawfully carried out. \u201cThe inmate is given the right to visit with his spiritual advisor beforehand and the advisor may witness the execution from a designated witness room that has a two-way window. As a concession, the [department] will waive the presence of the prison chaplain in the chamber during the execution.\u201d Ray is scheduled to be killed by lethal injection at Holman correctional facility near Atmore, Alabama, at 6pm on Thursday.",

      "body": "<p>Campaigners have called for renewed action to tackle Britain\u2019s housing crisis after <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/rough-sleeping-in-england-autumn-2018\">official figures</a> indicated a surge in rough sleeping in England\u2019s cities, coupled with record number of families living in overcrowded homes.</p> <p>Charities said welfare cuts, soaring rents and shortages of affordable homes were behind steep rises in street sleeping in London, Birmingham, and Manchester. There were 1,283 rough sleepers in the capital alone, a 13% increase, according to official figures</p> <p>The data for England as a whole, based on estimates after a single night snapshot in the autumn, disclosed that 4,677 people bedded down on the streets or in sheds and tents in 2018. This is 165% higher than in 2010, and charities said the latest figures were likely to be an underestimate.</p> <p>By illustration, separate rough sleeping figures for London alone released on Thursday by <a href=\"https://www.mungos.org/work-with-us/chain/\">the CHAIN database</a> and regarded as a more robust index of the scale of the problem, identified 3,289 rough sleepers in the capital between October and December, up 25% year on year.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a damning reflection of our society that night after night, so many people are forced to sleep rough on our streets \u2013 with numbers soaring in the capital \u2013 especially when we know that with the right commitment, rough sleeping could be ended for good,\u201d said the chief executive of the Crisis charity, Jon Sparkes.</p> <p>The 10 local authority areas with most rough sleepers were: Westminster, where a 41% annual rise took numbers to 306; Camden (141); Manchester (123); Birmingham (91); Bristol (82); Newham (79); Enfield (78); Hillingdon (70); City of London (67), and Brighton and Hove (64).</p> <p>Meanwhile the English Housing Survey revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/31/overcrowding-social-housing-england\">at least a million people in rented homes are now enduring overcrowding</a>. Some 300,000 households in social housing were overcrowded \u2013 the highest since records began 25 years ago \u2013 while 250,000 in the private rented sector were squeezed into too few rooms.</p> <p>The former Labour leader Ed Miliband, who is leading a campaign to build over 3m social homes in the next two decades, said the overcrowding figures were \u201cmore evidence of the human cost of the housing crisis which blights the lives of so many people\u201d.</p> <p>The rough sleeping figures came amid renewed concern about the risks of bedding down outside, especially as temperatures plummet. It emerged on Thursday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/31/spike-in-deaths-of-oxford-rough-sleepers-rocks-community-homeless\">four homeless people in Oxford have died</a> since November. The death on a Birmingham city centre street of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-47072844\">rough sleeper Kane Walker</a> was reported earlier this week.</p> <p>Nearly 600 homeless people died on the streets or in temporary accommodation in England and Wales in 2017, up 24% in five years, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/20/homeless-deaths-rise-by-a-quarter-in-five-years-official-figures-show\">official figures</a> published in December. The average age of a rough sleeper at death was 44 years for men and 42 years for women.</p> <p>The rough sleeper figures did show some improvement outside cities: across England there was a modest 2% fall \u2013 equivalent to 74 people, and the first time in eight years that national figures have not risen. Separate <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/774820/2017-18_EHS_Headline_Report.pdf\">housing statistic</a>s showed that after more than a decade of decline, the proportion of 35-44-year-olds owning their own homes had increased.</p> <p>The communities secretary, James Brokenshire, who launched the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/11/100m-drive-to-end-rough-sleeping-in-england-by-2027\">rough sleeping strategy</a> last year, said he needed to go further. \u201cWhile these figures are undoubtedly a step in the right direction, I do not underestimate the task ahead in achieving our ambition of eliminating rough sleeping altogether by 2027.\u201d</p> <p>Around two-thirds of the 89 councils who received special government grant funding last year to hire outreach staff and create hostel beds also managed to reduce numbers of rough sleepers in their area, according to the official statistics, suggesting that concerted political and financial investment may pay dividends.</p> <p>Rough sleeping figures fell overall in the south-east, the south-west, and east of England regions, the official figures show.

      "bodyText": "Campaigners have called for renewed action to tackle Britain\u2019s housing crisis after official figures indicated a surge in rough sleeping in England\u2019s cities, coupled with record number of families living in overcrowded homes. Charities said welfare cuts, soaring rents and shortages of affordable homes were behind steep rises in street sleeping in London, Birmingham, and Manchester. There were 1,283 rough sleepers in the capital alone, a 13% increase, according to official figures The data for England as a whole, based on estimates after a single night snapshot in the autumn, disclosed that 4,677 people bedded down on the streets or in sheds and tents in 2018. This is 165% higher than in 2010, and charities said the latest figures were likely to be an underestimate. By illustration, separate rough sleeping figures for London alone released on Thursday by the CHAIN database and regarded as a more robust index of the scale of the problem, identified 3,289 rough sleepers in the capital between October and December, up 25% year on year. \u201cIt\u2019s a damning reflection of our society that night after night, so many people are forced to sleep rough on our streets \u2013 with numbers soaring in the capital \u2013 especially when we know that with the right commitment, rough sleeping could be ended for good,\u201d said the chief executive of the Crisis charity, Jon Sparkes. The 10 local authority areas with most rough sleepers were: Westminster, where a 41% annual rise took numbers to 306; Camden (141); Manchester (123); Birmingham (91); Bristol (82); Newham (79); Enfield (78); Hillingdon (70); City of London (67), and Brighton and Hove (64). Meanwhile the English Housing Survey revealed that at least a million people in rented homes are now enduring overcrowding. Some 300,000 households in social housing were overcrowded \u2013 the highest since records began 25 years ago \u2013 while 250,000 in the private rented sector were squeezed into too few rooms. The former Labour leader Ed Miliband, who is leading a campaign to build over 3m social homes in the next two decades, said the overcrowding figures were \u201cmore evidence of the human cost of the housing crisis which blights the lives of so many people\u201d. The rough sleeping figures came amid renewed concern about the risks of bedding down outside, especially as temperatures plummet. It emerged on Thursday that four homeless people in Oxford have died since November. The death on a Birmingham city centre street of rough sleeper Kane Walker was reported earlier this week. Nearly 600 homeless people died on the streets or in temporary accommodation in England and Wales in 2017, up 24% in five years, according to official figures published in December. The average age of a rough sleeper at death was 44 years for men and 42 years for women. The rough sleeper figures did show some improvement outside cities: across England there was a modest 2% fall \u2013 equivalent to 74 people, and the first time in eight years that national figures have not risen. Separate housing statistics showed that after more than a decade of decline, the proportion of 35-44-year-olds owning their own homes had increased. The communities secretary, James Brokenshire, who launched the government\u2019s rough sleeping strategy last year, said he needed to go further. \u201cWhile these figures are undoubtedly a step in the right direction, I do not underestimate the task ahead in achieving our ambition of eliminating rough sleeping altogether by 2027.\u201d Around two-thirds of the 89 councils who received special government grant funding last year to hire outreach staff and create hostel beds also managed to reduce numbers of rough sleepers in their area, according to the official statistics, suggesting that concerted political and financial investment may pay dividends. Rough sleeping figures fell overall in the south-east, the south-west, and east of England regions, the official figures show. Brighton and Hove saw the biggest fall, down 114% year on year, despite this it remains one of England\u2019s homelessness hotspots. However,John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, said the figures were desperately disappointing. \u201cMinisters must do much more to make good the huge damage done over the last eight years. This new count shows that rough sleeping has more than doubled since 2010, but even these figures mask the true scale of the problem, as the government\u2019s numbers are well known to be flawed and a massive undercount of the true level of rough sleeping.\u201d Rough sleeper figures are based on one-night counts or paper estimates carried out in October or November. It defines rough sleepers as people sleeping, about to bed down or bedded down on the street, in doorways, parks, tents and sheds but not hostels or shelters. Officials admit ensuring data accuracy through this approach is \u201cinherently difficult\u201d. Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said although the apparent stabilising of national rough sleeper figures was \u201crare piece of good news\u201d it would have limited effects without wider measures to tackle social housing shortages, high rents and a failing social security benefits system. The Chartered Institute of Housing deputy chief executive, Gavin Smart, said: \u201cTo truly get to the root of the problem, the government must invest in more genuinely affordable housing as well as reviewing the impact of welfare reforms like the benefit cap, universal credit and the housing benefit freeze for private renters.\u201d Depaul UK homeless charity\u2019s chief executive, Mike Thiedke, said: \u201cRough sleeping will not end unless issues with the benefits system are sorted out.

Ch\u00e1vez had led an abortive coup attempt in 1992 and after winning power through the ballot box he set about transforming society. Ch\u00e1vez drove through a wide range of social reforms as part of his Bolivarian revolution, financed with the help of high oil profits \u2013 but he also bypassed parliament with a new constitution in 1999.</p>\n    <p>The muzzling of parliamentary democracy \u2013 and the spread of corruption and mismanagement in state-run enterprises \u2013 intensified after 2010 amid falling oil prices. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s \u201ceconomic war\u201d against shortages led to hyperinflation and the collapse of private sector industry. The implosion in the economy between 2013 and 2017 was worse than the US in the Great Depression.</p>\n    <p>In an attempt to stabilise the economy and control prices of essential goods, Ch\u00e1vez introduced strict controls on foreign currency exchange, but the mechanism soon became a tool for corruption.</p>\n    <p>When&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/05/hugo-chavez\">Ch\u00e1vez died of cancer</a>, his place was taken by his foreign minister, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has intensified his mentor\u2019s approach of responding to the economic downward spiral by concentrating power, ruling by decree and political repression.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe dictatorship believes it can scare us,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 told an audience of supporters, announcing that he had received reports of his home being visited by members of the Special Actions Force (FAES) police unit.

      "bodyText": "The politician spearheading efforts to force Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power has vowed to step up his \u201cfight for freedom\u201d amid reports Venezuelan special forces had visited his home in the capital Caracas. Addressing a packed theatre at the city\u2019s Central University of Venezuela on Thursday lunchtime, Juan Guaid\u00f3 said the opposition was determined to end Venezuela\u2019s \u201ctragedy\u201d and lead the country into a new era of stability and prosperity. The 35-year-old former student leader \u2013 at the centre of a growing political storm since declaring himself Venezuela\u2019s interim president last week \u2013 summoned new protests for Saturday in an effort to increase pressure on Maduro\u2019s embattled regime. \u201cThe dictatorship believes it can scare us,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 told an audience of supporters, announcing that he had received reports of his home being visited by members of the Special Actions Force (FAES) police unit. His baby daughter and grandmother were reportedly at home at the time. Guaid\u00f3 insisted Venezuelan citizens would fail to be intimidated and had grown tired of the humanitarian emergency into which their country has fallen under Maduro. \u201cIt isn\u2019t through \u2026 repression that they will manage to tame a brave people that seeks freedom, democracy, food, medicine and above all a better future for their children,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 said, to loud cheers from the crowd. \u201cWe are in the streets and we will remain in the streets until the usurpation ends.\u201d As the opposition leader spoke the crowd erupted in cheers of \u201c\u00a1S\u00ed se puede!\u201d (\u201cYes we can) \u2013 the Obama-era slogan the young politician has sought to adopt in his struggle to bring down Maduro. One woman shouted: \u201cYou\u2019re not alone Guaid\u00f3! We\u2019re all with you!\u201d Guaid\u00f3 was speaking at the launch of Plan Pa\u00eds (Plan for the Country) a wide-ranging opposition blueprint that claims it can rescue Venezuela\u2019s economy and end a humanitarian crisis that has seen around a tenth of the population flee overseas. The plan \u2013 a direct challenge to Maduro\u2019s six-year Plan de la Patria (Homeland Plan) \u2013 includes projects to revive the country\u2019s once great oil company PDVSA, fix Venezuela\u2019s broken health service and feed its starving people by guaranteeing them access to basic food stuffs and offering grants to the poorest 48% of families. \u201c[The plan is] a joint effort. There is no one spokesperson. There is no messianic leader. This is a team, a big team of leaders who are committed to [Venezuela\u2019s development],\u201d said Guaid\u00f3, who had been a little-known politician until the crisis catapulted him to national and international prominence this month. \u201cPeople say that this is a problem of left or right in Venezuela. No. It\u2019s a problem of humanity,\u201d he added. Elizabeth Guerrero, a 59-year-old retired teacher, had come to watch with a poster that read: \u2018Juan Guaid\u00f3. Thank you for giving us hope and faith\u2019. \u201cI\u2019m here because Juan Guaid\u00f3 has given us back hope and filled us with faith that, yes, we can get out of this chaos. The people were resigned because it seemed like there was neither a plan, nor a strategy. But [the opposition] are showing that [they can] \u2026 help us out of this disaster.\u201d Yon Goicoechea, a prominent opposition leader, said: \u201cWe are closer to democracy than ever before.\u201d Guaid\u00f3 urged the Venezuelan security forces to throw their weight behind his bid to unseat Maduro, which has received backing from the United States, and regional heavyweights including Brazil and Colombia. Leading European states including France, Germany and Britain have declared Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate interim leader. \u201cI say to FAES [Venezuela\u2019s special forces] and I say to the armed forces: you still have time to put yourselves on the right side of history and to respect the constitution,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 said. Outside the university\u2019s tree-lined entrance, hundreds of riot police had gathered and students chanted anti-Maduro songs. Pro-Guaid\u00f3 graffiti artists had taken to the nearby walls with red paint. \u201cThe dictatorship is hunger and terror,\u201d read one message. \u201cEnough misery and repression,\u201d said another. Maduro, crucially, continues to enjoy the backing of both Beijing and Moscow. But on Thursday Guaid\u00f3 urged them to cut loose his political rival \u2013 who came to power following Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s death in 2013 and was returned to office in disputed elections last year \u2013 and embrace a new government he claimed would reintroduce the rule-of-law and stabilise Venezuela\u2019s collapsed economy. \u201cChina and Russia would also benefit from a change in government in this country,\u201d he argued. Maduro has accused Guaid\u00f3 of being a puppet in a US-backed coup attempt. In a video released on Tuesday morning he accused Donald Trump and the \u201cgroup of extremists around him\u201d of plotting to topple him in order to seize Venezuela\u2019s oil. Trump risked transforming the South American country into a new Vietnam, Maduro claimed. \u201cWe will not allow a Vietnam in Latin America. If the US intends to intervene against us they will get a Vietnam worse than they could have imagined,\u201d he said. Additional reporting by Patricia Torres in Caracas",

      "bodyText": "Women discussed as rape targets by a group of male students at the University of Warwick say they are terrified of seeing the men return to campus after the university reduced the length of their suspension. Last year five men were barred or suspended by the university over their membership of a long-running group chat that discussed rape and sexual assault of women, including individual students, as well as racism, antisemitism and homophobia. After a decision from the university\u2019s disciplinary proceedings in June, two of the men were banned from the Warwick campus for 10 years. But it has emerged that, after an appeal, the two will be able to return to the campus from September. Two of the other men were suspended for just one year, meaning that four of the five who were disciplined could return as students at the start of the next academic year. The fifth student was banned from the campus for life. In an open letter to Warwick, one of the women involved said: \u201cI feel terrified at the prospect of having these boys in my seminars and lectures, as they sit there feeling guilt-free. Knowing that I may have to come face to face with them again just to continue my education is unacceptable.\u201d Saying that she had suffered from depression, anxiety and eating disorders since the group chats were published, the woman said she felt humiliated. \u201cYou have failed to protect countless students like myself, and don\u2019t even have an adequate system in place to look after students who are suffering and hurting,\u201d she told the university. The news of the return of the men also provoked a strong reaction among the university\u2019s staff. \u201cStaff and students in my department are united in our shock and disgust at this decision,\u201d Prof Emma Mason, head of Warwick\u2019s English department, said in a letter to the vice-chancellor, Stuart Croft. \u201cWe wish to express strong and renewed support for those students harmed by these posts, abhorrence at the contents of the posts, and a deep concern about the decision to reduce the terms of suspension.\u201d The university said in a statement that the behaviour of the men involved in the group chat was \u201cabhorrent and unacceptable\u201d. Prof Christine Ennew, provost of the University of Warwick, said that the appeals panel focussed on the scale of the penalties, with the students accepting culpability. \u201cPrivacy considerations mean that we are not able to disclose the specific details on which the decisions were made.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May is to instruct officials to examine the proposals for an alternative backstop in the so-called Malthouse compromise, after a delegation of Brexiter and remainer MPs briefed the prime minister in Downing Street. The meeting came hours after the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, admitted that article 50 might have to be extended to avoid the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal on 29 March, earning him a rebuke from Downing Street. May met Tory MPs and ministers including the former education secretary Nicky Morgan, the solicitor-general, Robert Buckland, and key figures in the hard Brexit European Research Group including Jacob Rees-Mogg, Steve Baker and Iain Duncan Smith. Officials will \u201ctest the workability\u201d of the alternative to the Irish backstop proposal, which includes using technological solutions to facilitate a smooth border crossing without infrastructure. \u201cIt\u2019s very much about involving politicians rather than saying: don\u2019t call us, we\u2019ll call you,\u201d one MP said. \u201cEurosceptics and remainers left feeling encouraged that the atmosphere was receptive and constructive and if she continues that approach it will stand us in good stead for getting something with a consensus around it.\u201d The plan has its roots in the Brexiters\u2019 preferred solution to the Irish border that was discussed by the cabinet last spring \u2013 the maximum facilitation model, nicknamed \u201cmax fac\u201d. Despite the strong preference for the model from some Brexiters, May\u2019s Chequers plan decided on a different customs model given the unpredictability around the technology. There is some optimism in government however that since that was rejected by May and by Brussels as unworkable, attitudes have begun to shift on both sides. The political declaration and the January letter from Donald Tusk, the European council president, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, have an explicit reference to alternative arrangements, sources point out. Whitehall sources believe that those solutions now have \u201cmore currency\u201d than when they were discussed early last year. Others in government and in Brussels are more sceptical that the as-yet-unknown technology would prevent the need for additional customs checks or border infrastructure. The business secretary, Greg Clark, one of the cabinet ministers who examined the max-fac model early last year, said he was wary of the proposal. \u201cI can\u2019t see that those technical possibilities are there yet,\u201d he told ITV. The EU\u2019s deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand, has previously said the required technology does not exist, and negotiators had \u201clooked at every border on this Earth, every border EU has with a third country \u2013 there\u2019s simply no way you can do away with checks and controls\u201d. Sources in the meeting with May described it as \u201ca positive start\u201d and said it had an atmosphere intended to engender trust between two previously warring factions. \u201cWe had the right people in the room, talking about the right bits of detail,\u201d one MP said. \u201cThere is a degree of trust there now because everyone is taking a risk by being there.\u201d Though Downing Street has been willing to take a serious look at the first element of the Malthouse compromise, there appears to be less willingness to countenance the second part of the plan \u2013 effectively a three-year transition to no deal \u2013 and no optimism the EU would allow such a thing to happen. Speaking earlier, Hunt suggested that Clark\u2019s pessimism about the lack of technology to facilitate such a smooth border process was a personal opinion and said the government should welcome the consensus in the party. \u201cWe are not looking at one particular solution, which is the only way forward. There was a consensus in the Conservative parliamentary party around a technology solution put together by Kit Malthouse,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is one of the things we are looking at. He [Clark] had some scepticism about it.\u201d Pressed on what alternative arrangements the government would be proposing to the EU, Hunt said: \u201cWe have put these proposals together, we have to work them up, we have to go through them in detail with our partners in the EU \u2026 It is going to take a few days to do that.\u201d The foreign secretary, speaking to the BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, conceded that a delay might be necessary if an agreement with the EU was reached just days before the March deadline \u2013 although the prime minister has consistently ruled out seeking any extension. Insiders suggested that the foreign secretary\u2019s remarks were unhelpful, although they appeared to be accurate because there will come a point in March where it will no longer be possible to ratify a deal in time for the end of the month.",

      "bodyText": "Npower, one of big six energy firms, is to cut 900 jobs, as the company warned it would make significant financial losses this year. The German-owned supplier blamed the cuts, about 15% of its UK workforce, on the government\u2019s price cap on default tariffs and \u201cintense competition\u201d in sector over fixed deals. Npower said about 900 roles would go over the coming year and that it would consult staff over the next month. The company\u2019s chief executive hit out at what he described as unsustainable pricing by challenger firms, nine of which have collapsed in the past year as wholesale costs increased. Paul Coffey said: \u201cThe retail energy market is incredibly tough. Ofgem forecasts that five of the big six energy companies will make a loss or less than normal profits this year owing to the implementation of the price cap.

The regulator is expected to announce an increase in the level of the cap next week, potentially adding nearly \u00a3100 to the annual bills of 11 million households on default tariffs. Coffey said npower was still forecasting \u201csignificant losses\u201d this year, even after the savings from a reduced workforce bill. Innogy SE, its German owner, has already warned that keeping npower could hit overall group profits by as much as \u20ac250m (\u00a3218m) in 2019. Npower had hoped to merge with the retail arm of fellow big six firm SSE, but the deal collapsed in December after they failed to agree on how much capital to inject into the new supplier. Instead, ownership of the business is to be transferred to E.ON as part of a complex asset swap between Innogy and the rival German energy company.

It has long been said of <em>Les Bleus </em>that you never know which team is going to turn up. It could be referring to selection rather than the temperamental nature of a team that used to be renowned for its inconsistency, but Jacques Brunel had been in charge for only a few months then.</p> <p>The head coach is changing the balance of a side that since the last World Cup has scored 48 tries in 29 Tests against tier-one nations, reaching four only once, against Italy. A team full of bash has been bashful with ball in hand and by dropping Mathieu Bastareaud, a bulwark in midfield, to pair the 19\u2011year\u2011old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/30/wales-hand-tomos-williams-debut-for-six-nations-opener-in-france-rugby-union\" title=\"\">Romain Ntamack with Wesley Fofana</a>, he is sending a clear message to his players.</p> <p>Brunel is rugby\u2019s version of the Leicester City manager, Claude Puel, looking and speaking like a bank manager turning down a request for an overdraft, but under him there are signs of a French revolution. Their pack is still huge but two of the forward replacements, the front-rowers Julien Marchand and Demba Bamba, were in the side that won the World Rugby Under-20 Championship last year, along with Ntamack.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>A year ago, Brunel was asked what had happened to the flair for which France used to be renowned. He wondered whether the past was being romanticised, but the game\u2019s cavaliers have turned into roundheads. If he is not looking to turn back time, he is trying to fit <em>Les Bleus</em> into the present where merely being robust in defence is not enough.</p> <p>Wales are further down the same route. Their first unbeaten autumn in the modern era was based on their defence rather than attack, but there were signs of significant progress. Gatland preferred Gareth Anscombe at fly-half to Dan Biggar, swapping a tactical kicker and zealous tackler for one who stood flatter and brought his outside backs into play earlier.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/30/wales-hand-tomos-williams-debut-for-six-nations-opener-in-france-rugby-union\">Wales surprised after France mix brute force and flair in Six Nations opener</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wales adopted New Zealand\u2019s tactic of extending the ruck when in possession by using the first man at the breakdown to propel himself forward. It gave their scrum-half more space and time and with Wales\u2019 tight five forwards all comfortable with the ball in hand, there was a width to their attacks.</p> <p>Liam Williams\u2019s return to full\u2011back gives them a player who will be willing to exploit defensive gaps and mismatches, and a fixture which for most of this decade has tended to be a relentless grind has the capacity to be more tactical and adventurous. France have removed their anchor, Bastareaud, while Wales, without Leigh Halfpenny, resisted any temptation to use Biggar as a goal\u2011kicking crutch.</p> <p>\u201cI am excited about where we are as a team,\u201d said Gatland, who is in his 12th and final year as Wales\u2019 head coach. \u201cIt promises to be a very tight Six Nations and if we have a good tournament it should help us at the end of the year. Everyone is talking about Ireland in the World Cup, but they will get New Zealand or South Africa in the quarter-finals while we are on the other side of the draw.\u201d</p> <p>Victory in Paris would give Wales momentum, something on which they thrive. They will need to move around the French forwards, widening the point of attack and keeping the ball in play, while dealing with the home side\u2019s driving mauls.</p> <p>France, at the end of a week when it has snowed in the French capital, have used the scrum as a source of penalties, but the game is at a point where only the most egregious offences attract the whistle in the quest for continuity. Both coaches have adapted to that which is why one of the tournament\u2019s more sterile fixtures could produce some early spring flowers.</p>",

It could be referring to selection rather than the temperamental nature of a team that used to be renowned for its inconsistency, but Jacques Brunel had been in charge for only a few months then. The head coach is changing the balance of a side that since the last World Cup has scored 48 tries in 29 Tests against tier-one nations, reaching four only once, against Italy. A team full of bash has been bashful with ball in hand and by dropping Mathieu Bastareaud, a bulwark in midfield, to pair the 19\u2011year\u2011old Romain Ntamack with Wesley Fofana, he is sending a clear message to his players. Brunel is rugby\u2019s version of the Leicester City manager, Claude Puel, looking and speaking like a bank manager turning down a request for an overdraft, but under him there are signs of a French revolution. Their pack is still huge but two of the forward replacements, the front-rowers Julien Marchand and Demba Bamba, were in the side that won the World Rugby Under-20 Championship last year, along with Ntamack. A year ago, Brunel was asked what had happened to the flair for which France used to be renowned. He wondered whether the past was being romanticised, but the game\u2019s cavaliers have turned into roundheads. If he is not looking to turn back time, he is trying to fit Les Bleus into the present where merely being robust in defence is not enough. Wales are further down the same route. Their first unbeaten autumn in the modern era was based on their defence rather than attack, but there were signs of significant progress. Gatland preferred Gareth Anscombe at fly-half to Dan Biggar, swapping a tactical kicker and zealous tackler for one who stood flatter and brought his outside backs into play earlier. Wales adopted New Zealand\u2019s tactic of extending the ruck when in possession by using the first man at the breakdown to propel himself forward. It gave their scrum-half more space and time and with Wales\u2019 tight five forwards all comfortable with the ball in hand, there was a width to their attacks. Liam Williams\u2019s return to full\u2011back gives them a player who will be willing to exploit defensive gaps and mismatches, and a fixture which for most of this decade has tended to be a relentless grind has the capacity to be more tactical and adventurous. France have removed their anchor, Bastareaud, while Wales, without Leigh Halfpenny, resisted any temptation to use Biggar as a goal\u2011kicking crutch. \u201cI am excited about where we are as a team,\u201d said Gatland, who is in his 12th and final year as Wales\u2019 head coach. \u201cIt promises to be a very tight Six Nations and if we have a good tournament it should help us at the end of the year. Everyone is talking about Ireland in the World Cup, but they will get New Zealand or South Africa in the quarter-finals while we are on the other side of the draw.\u201d Victory in Paris would give Wales momentum, something on which they thrive. They will need to move around the French forwards, widening the point of attack and keeping the ball in play, while dealing with the home side\u2019s driving mauls. France, at the end of a week when it has snowed in the French capital, have used the scrum as a source of penalties, but the game is at a point where only the most egregious offences attract the whistle in the quest for continuity. Both coaches have adapted to that which is why one of the tournament\u2019s more sterile fixtures could produce some early spring flowers.",

Analysis of figures published by HM Revenue and Customs on Thursday revealed that the total cost of Britain\u2019s system of tax relief had risen to a record \u00a3164bn annually \u2013 more than the entire NHS budget. While the measures are designed by the government to provide support to struggling households or to encourage economic growth, campaigners and Labour seized on the figures as evidence that the tax system has become increasingly tilted in favour of the richest in society.

CBS\u2019s refusal to run a cannabis-focused investment firm\u2019s ad advocating for the legalization of medical cannabis marked a coup for an industry whose product is still illegal federally. \u201cThe fact that an ad was even considered for the Super Bowl shows that we\u2019ve turned a corner,\u201d Lisa Buffo, the founder of the Cannabis Marketing Association, told the Guardian. Cannabis industry advocates have spent decades countering both fearmongering over marijuana and Cheech and Chong stoner stereotypes. But now that cannabis is legal in some form in 33 states and two in three Americans are in support of legalization, the industry has entered a new phase and has turned its attention to branding and marketing. The dream of a bud broadcast in the same vein as a mass-consumed Bud Light commercial most likely won\u2019t come to fruition until the drug is legal federally. Companies can only advertise in states that have legalized cannabis and they are bound by state and local regulations. State and local authorities have imposed varying limitations, including on billboards in areas frequented by those under the age of 21. There are no formal statistics on how much the industry is spending on marketing, Buffo said, though the Cannabis Marketing Association is working to track those numbers this year. Buffo believes cannabis businesses spend less than companies in other industries on marketing since it\u2019s not considered a deductible business expense for them. But even if the industry were to spend just 10% of its revenue on advertising, that would still amount to $900m total. MedMen\u2019s brand of \u201credefining the cannabis industry\u201d has translated into an extensive advertising blitz that includes print ads in southern California, web banner ads, social media influencers, and more than 30 traditional billboards and 60 mobile billboards in California and Nevada. The Los Angeles-based company also has its own \u201ccannabis and culture journal\u201d called Ember, in partnership with Paper magazine. The August issue featured the actor Lake Bell on the cover. And then there\u2019s Ignite Cannabis, a California-based company whose Instagram full of scantily clad women looks like a shot out of a Fyre Festival documentary. In September, a billboard in Modesto depicting two women from behind with the words \u201cBest Buds\u201d prompted outrage among some parents who believed it sent \u201cthe wrong message\u201d to their children. The billboard, however, was in compliance with state regulations for marijuana advertising that required it \u201conly be displayed where at least 71.6% of the audience is reasonably expected to be 21 years of age or older\u201d. Some local lawmakers feel that state regulations have not gone far enough in protecting children. Chris Cate, a councilman in San Diego, California, introduced legislation in October that would go beyond state law and prohibit billboards within 1,000 feet of schools, parks, youth-oriented facilities, recreation centers, libraries, churches and residential care facilities, and within 100 feet of residential housing. His proposal would also restrict websites like Weedmaps and Eaze, which list and rate local dispensaries, and websites that facilitate marijuana deliveries. \u201cWe wanted to put together regulations that would treat the cannabis industry similar to how we would treat the tobacco and alcohol industries,\u201d Cate told the Guardian. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to encourage underage usage, and I think that\u2019s important for the city and residents.\u201d San Diego\u2019s legal marijuana businesses appeared supportive of Cate\u2019s proposal. Phil Rath, the executive director of the United Medical Marijuana Coalition, told the Los Angeles Times that they seemed like \u201ccommonsense reforms\u201d. Given concern over perceptions of the burgeoning industry, many seem more than willing to work within the restrictions set by local and state jurisdictions. Perhaps unsurprisingly for an industry that was once associated with shady dealings in liquor store parking lots, advertising a product and educating the public are two sides of the same coin. The Super Bowl ad, put forth by the cannabis-focused investment firm Acreage Holdings, for example, called for federal legalization of medical cannabis. Consumer education is still \u201ca huge growth area\u201d, said Allan Steiner, who heads insights and development for Green Rush Consulting, an Oakland-based firm that provides guidance to cannabis entrepreneurs. He noted that the \u201c50-plus crowd\u201d is \u201cthe largest-growing cannabis market\u201d. \u201cMy prediction is that cannabis will continue to go in the direction of wine and craft beer, and the consumer knowledge of the product will become similarly nuanced over time,\u201d Steiner argued. \u201cCannabis has been illegal for 80-plus years, so its history is steeped in prohibition, propaganda, and more recently the drug war,\u201d said Buffo, of the Cannabis Marketing Association. \u201cIn essence, everything the industry does with cannabis is representing the new era of legal cannabis and thus, its new brand. Until the stigma changes, it can be argued that marketing and branding cannabis is its own form of advocacy.\u201d For the leadership at Acreage Holdings, the advocacy angle of their Super Bowl ad meant that in the end, it didn\u2019t really matter that CBS rejected it. \u201cOur hopes were that we would get it to run, but we knew that either way that we would get the word out there,\u201d Harris Damashek, Acreage Holdings\u2019 chief marketing officer, said in an interview. \u201cWe knew that there would be interest in the story, and the story is in the PSA.\u201d In the world of viral marketing, the ad was a success. The minute-long video was played, uploaded on the internet and viewed hundreds of thousands of times despite CBS\u2019s rejection. George Allen, the firm\u2019s president, appeared on CNN, and the message the firm wanted to send was seen by millions: legalize it. \u201cI think we\u2019re knocking down false narratives and preconceived issues that people have about cannabis all day long,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI think five years ago, a PSA about medical cannabis around the Super Bowl would have been poorly received. Now I think most people around the country have one degree of separation from someone whose life has been changed in the positive by cannabis and that\u2019s why I think the message now matters.\u201d And perhaps one day, that might mean actual Super Bowl airtime.",

The second is that they should have taken place months ago. Both leaders must bear a share of responsibility for the long avoidance of cross-party dialogue about a decision that is so fundamental to the British people\u2019s future. But it is Mrs May, as the head of government and the person in charge of Brexit policy, who must bear the larger share by far.</p> <p>The prime minister has come to these talks at the eleventh hour, whereas she should have begun them before she triggered the article 50 withdrawal process 22 months ago.

      "bodyText": "The first thing to say about this week\u2019s talks between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn over Brexit is that they are a sign of realism on both sides. The second is that they should have taken place months ago. Both leaders must bear a share of responsibility for the long avoidance of cross-party dialogue about a decision that is so fundamental to the British people\u2019s future. But it is Mrs May, as the head of government and the person in charge of Brexit policy, who must bear the larger share by far. The prime minister has come to these talks at the eleventh hour, whereas she should have begun them before she triggered the article 50 withdrawal process 22 months ago. The danger now is that, although welcome in principle, the talks will have little practical effect. This is in part because there is little established basis for trust between the two sides, in part because time is now so limited before 29 March to achieve anything major, and in part because Mrs May \u2013 and perhaps Mr Corbyn too \u2013 prefers to see them as a tactical expedient, rather than as a serious national opportunity, even at this late stage. The fact remains that, ever since the 2017 election resulted in a hung parliament, it has always been clear to those who can count that Mrs May would struggle to get a Commons majority for anything approaching a pragmatic Brexit agreement with Conservative and DUP votes alone. Her party contains too many deregulatory and anti-European ideologues for that. She already knew this when she became leader in 2016. Two and a half years on, she still knows it. She is more aware than anyone that the 16-vote majority to reopen talks with the EU on the Northern Ireland backstop may not withstand contact with the real world.

But no group is more threatened by freezing weather than rough sleepers. Since 2010, the number of people without a roof over their heads in England has risen 165% to 4,677, although official <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/31/rough-sleeping-rises-in-nearly-all-englands-major-cities-london-birmingham\" title=\"\">figures this week</a> show a 2% fall.

Public sympathy coexists with less generous attitudes, and some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/19/homeless-people-violent-attacks-alcohol-easy-prey-liverpool\" title=\"\">startling instances of cruelty</a>. Many people do not wish to think too hard about how it feels to have nowhere to go.</p> <p>Like families in temporary or overcrowded homes, or the hidden homeless who stay with friends or relatives, what rough sleepers need most is a suitable place to live \u2013 in winter more than ever. That is why the \u201chousing first\u201d approach being trialled in some areas, which treats accommodation as the priority ahead of interventions such as drug treatment, is the right one. In Greater Manchester, one of the pilot areas, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/31/how-greater-manchester-is-taking-on-rough-sleeping-pilot-social-bond-wigan\" title=\"\">number of rough sleepers has fallen</a>, bucking a trend \u2013 in most cities it has gone up.</p> <p>Particularly on cold nights, it makes sense to try to minimise the number of people bedding down in tents or doorways, as the government is trying to do with a strategy aimed at <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-rough-sleeping-strategy\" title=\"\">eliminating rough sleeping by 2027</a>. But unless the deeply rooted problems that drive people on to the streets are addressed along with the fact of their homelessness, efforts to shift them permanently indoors are unlikely to be effective. Underlying the cold, hunger, stress and dirt that rough sleepers struggle with day-to-day are long-term difficulties including family breakdown, poor mental health, lack of income due to benefit sanctions, substance misuse, domestic violence and refugee status. As our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/31/spike-in-deaths-of-oxford-rough-sleepers-rocks-community-homeless\" title=\"\">report from Oxford</a> this week showed, providing shelter on its own is not necessarily a solution. Sharron Maasz, who died there over the past fortnight, was a former rough sleeper. Friends said she needed more support than was forthcoming.</p> <p>Rough sleeping is a cause as well as a consequence of many of the problems that homeless people face, and attention must now shift to prevention. The scope of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/28/revealed-homeless-people-given-one-way-tickets-to-leave-areas\" title=\"\">legal duty to refer those at risk</a> to other services should be extended beyond local authorities. Helping people before they crash through the social safety net makes far more sense than scrabbling around in the cold and dark to drag them back in.</p>",

The number of deaths of rough sleepers has also risen sharply, to 600 in 2017, although few have sparked the outcry of Gyula Remes, who died before Christmas outside the Houses of Parliament. These are the people at the sharp edge of a much bigger homelessness crisis, with more than 82,000 households in temporary accommodation. Public sympathy coexists with less generous attitudes, and some startling instances of cruelty. Many people do not wish to think too hard about how it feels to have nowhere to go. Like families in temporary or overcrowded homes, or the hidden homeless who stay with friends or relatives, what rough sleepers need most is a suitable place to live \u2013 in winter more than ever. That is why the \u201chousing first\u201d approach being trialled in some areas, which treats accommodation as the priority ahead of interventions such as drug treatment, is the right one. In Greater Manchester, one of the pilot areas, the number of rough sleepers has fallen, bucking a trend \u2013 in most cities it has gone up. Particularly on cold nights, it makes sense to try to minimise the number of people bedding down in tents or doorways, as the government is trying to do with a strategy aimed at eliminating rough sleeping by 2027. But unless the deeply rooted problems that drive people on to the streets are addressed along with the fact of their homelessness, efforts to shift them permanently indoors are unlikely to be effective. Underlying the cold, hunger, stress and dirt that rough sleepers struggle with day-to-day are long-term difficulties including family breakdown, poor mental health, lack of income due to benefit sanctions, substance misuse, domestic violence and refugee status. As our report from Oxford this week showed, providing shelter on its own is not necessarily a solution. Sharron Maasz, who died there over the past fortnight, was a former rough sleeper. Friends said she needed more support than was forthcoming. Rough sleeping is a cause as well as a consequence of many of the problems that homeless people face, and attention must now shift to prevention. The scope of the legal duty to refer those at risk to other services should be extended beyond local authorities. Helping people before they crash through the social safety net makes far more sense than scrabbling around in the cold and dark to drag them back in.",

The problems run deeper.

      "body": "<p>Italian police have taken possession of more than two tonnes of cocaine in the largest drugs seizure in the country in 25 years, after a sting operation involving three other nations across two continents.</p> \n<p>The drugs, discovered in 60 bags in a cargo container at the Port of Genoa, have a total value of \u20ac500m (\u00a3436m) and were found with the help of the British, Colombian and Spanish police.</p> \n<p>The cocaine belongs to various drug-trafficking organisations associated with an organised armed group known as the \u201cGulf Clan\u201d, which makes use of contacts in numerous European ports where drug expeditions are carried out. The container set off from Colombia and arrived in Genoa last week and was then destined for Barcelona in Spain.</p> \n<p>To catch the traffickers in Barcelona, the Italian investigators replaced the cargo of drugs - 1,801 bricks of pure cocaine - with salt and let it continue on its journey. In the Catalan city, Spanish police arrested the alleged recipient of the shipment, a 59-year-old Spaniard.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe had four hours to make a decision,\u201d Maurizio Cintura, lieutenant of the Guardia di Finanza, told the Guardian. \u201cAfter four hours the container had to leave for Barcelona where the traffickers were waiting for it. We therefore put 40 military in place, unloaded the two tonnes of cocaine and replaced it with 1,800 packets of salt. Then we placed GPS receivers in the load. This allowed us to arrest a 59-year-old man related to drug traffickers at Barcelona port.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cintura said the investigation began on 22 January in Colombia and that the seized drugs would have been marketed all over Europe. The operation, dubbed \u2018\u2018Genoese snow\u2019\u2019, follows another seizure of cocaine at the port of Livorno on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>In that case, 644 kilos of cocaine were hidden inside bags of coffee. The drugs were divided into 582 bricks inside 23 bags, hidden in one of the thousands of containers loaded on a ship flying the Portuguese flag and coming from the Spanish port of Algeciras. The value of the cocaine found in the earlier raid was around \u20ac130m.</p> \n<p>Spanish police said that using an empty container was a new technique being adopted by criminal organisations there. </p> \n<p>The two operations were not connected, police said, although both Italian ports seem to have become important destinations for cocaine trafficking from South America.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe port of Genoa, along with that of Livorno, has become the new narco trafficking crossroads,\u201d said Genoa chief prosecutor, Francesco Cozzi, in a press conference.</p> \n<p>Prosecutors in Genoa said they were now looking into the connections between the cartels in South America and the drug traffickers in Europe. When asked about the role of the Italian Mafia in the Genoa raid, investigators said: \u201cIt is too early to say.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Calabrian Mafia, or so-called \u2018Ndrangheta mafia, is thought to run much of Europe\u2019s cocaine trade. A study by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/26/ndrangheta-mafia-mcdonalds-deutsche-bank-study\">Demoskopika research institute</a> in 2013 claimed the \u2019Ndrangheta made more money than Deutsche Bank and McDonald\u2019s put together, with a turnover of \u20ac53bn.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Italian police have taken possession of more than two tonnes of cocaine in the largest drugs seizure in the country in 25 years, after a sting operation involving three other nations across two continents. The drugs, discovered in 60 bags in a cargo container at the Port of Genoa, have a total value of \u20ac500m (\u00a3436m) and were found with the help of the British, Colombian and Spanish police. The cocaine belongs to various drug-trafficking organisations associated with an organised armed group known as the \u201cGulf Clan\u201d, which makes use of contacts in numerous European ports where drug expeditions are carried out. The container set off from Colombia and arrived in Genoa last week and was then destined for Barcelona in Spain. To catch the traffickers in Barcelona, the Italian investigators replaced the cargo of drugs - 1,801 bricks of pure cocaine - with salt and let it continue on its journey. In the Catalan city, Spanish police arrested the alleged recipient of the shipment, a 59-year-old Spaniard. \u201cWe had four hours to make a decision,\u201d Maurizio Cintura, lieutenant of the Guardia di Finanza, told the Guardian. \u201cAfter four hours the container had to leave for Barcelona where the traffickers were waiting for it. We therefore put 40 military in place, unloaded the two tonnes of cocaine and replaced it with 1,800 packets of salt. Then we placed GPS receivers in the load. This allowed us to arrest a 59-year-old man related to drug traffickers at Barcelona port.\u201d Cintura said the investigation began on 22 January in Colombia and that the seized drugs would have been marketed all over Europe. The operation, dubbed \u2018\u2018Genoese snow\u2019\u2019, follows another seizure of cocaine at the port of Livorno on Wednesday. In that case, 644 kilos of cocaine were hidden inside bags of coffee. The drugs were divided into 582 bricks inside 23 bags, hidden in one of the thousands of containers loaded on a ship flying the Portuguese flag and coming from the Spanish port of Algeciras. The value of the cocaine found in the earlier raid was around \u20ac130m. Spanish police said that using an empty container was a new technique being adopted by criminal organisations there. The two operations were not connected, police said, although both Italian ports seem to have become important destinations for cocaine trafficking from South America. \u201cThe port of Genoa, along with that of Livorno, has become the new narco trafficking crossroads,\u201d said Genoa chief prosecutor, Francesco Cozzi, in a press conference. Prosecutors in Genoa said they were now looking into the connections between the cartels in South America and the drug traffickers in Europe. When asked about the role of the Italian Mafia in the Genoa raid, investigators said: \u201cIt is too early to say.\u201d The Calabrian Mafia, or so-called \u2018Ndrangheta mafia, is thought to run much of Europe\u2019s cocaine trade. A study by the Demoskopika research institute in 2013 claimed the \u2019Ndrangheta made more money than Deutsche Bank and McDonald\u2019s put together, with a turnover of \u20ac53bn.",

Keyboardist Dave Greenfield, who joined the band in 1975, months after their Star Inn gig, was also at the presentation. The pub\u2019s backroom music venue, which hosts around five gigs a week, is currently appealing against a noise abatement notice requiring them to reduce noise levels or face fines of up to \u00a320,000.

Settlers killed off huge numbers of people in conflicts and also by spreading disease, which reduced the indigenous population by 90% in the century following Christopher Columbus\u2019s initial journey to the Americas and Caribbean in 1492. This \u201clarge-scale depopulation\u201d resulted in vast tracts of agricultural land being left untended, researchers say, allowing the land to become overgrown with trees and other new vegetation. The regrowth soaked up enough carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to actually cool the planet, with the average temperature dropping by 0.15C in the late 1500s and early 1600s, the study by scientists at University College London found. \u201cThe great dying of the indigenous peoples of the Americas resulted in a human-driven global impact on the Earth system in the two centuries prior to the Industrial Revolution,\u201d wrote the UCL team of Alexander Koch, Chris Brierley, Mark Maslin and Simon Lewis. The drop in temperature during this period is known as the \u201cLittle Ice Age\u201d, a time when the River Thames in London would regularly freeze over, snowstorms were common in Portugal and disrupted agriculture caused famines in several European countries. The UCL researchers found that the European colonization of the Americas indirectly contributed to this colder period by causing the deaths of about 56 million people by 1600. The study attributes the deaths to factors including introduced disease, such as smallpox and measles, as well as warfare and societal collapse. Researchers then calculated how much land indigenous people required and then subsequently fell into disuse, finding that around 55m hectares, an area roughly equivalent to France, became vacant and was reclaimed by carbon dioxide-absorbing vegetation. The study sketches out a past where humans were influencing the climate long before the industrial revolution, where the use of fossil fuels for the manufacturing of goods, generation of electricity and transportation has allowed tens of billions of tons of carbon dioxide to be released into the atmosphere. Widespread deforestation for agriculture and urban development has also spurred the release of greenhouse gases, causing the planet to warm by around 1C over the past century. Scientists have warned that the world has little over a decade to drastically reduce emissions or face increasingly severe storms, drought, heatwaves, coastal flooding and food insecurity.

      "body": "<p>Saggy and shuffling, his dressing gown flapping over a middle-aged spread, Malachy is in garrulous confessional mode. His sofa has become an analyst\u2019s couch. This is to be his final reckoning, we realise. Depression has taken a firm hold.</p> <p>Simon O\u2019Gorman brings rueful charm to the role of this solitary man in <strong>Every Day I Wake Up Hopeful (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606)</strong>. It is one of two solo works about male mental health, presented as companion pieces on an extensive cross-border tour of Ireland by Belfast\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.primecutproductions.co.uk/\">Prime Cut Productions</a>, who had a hit in 2016 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/sep/27/stacey-gregg-women-birth-choice-scorch\">Stacey Gregg</a>\u2019s Scorch, in which a teenager grappled with gender identity.</p> <p>\u201cHow did I get here?\u201d is the driving question in both shows, as men attempt to find their way through a fog of confusion. Designer Ciaran Bagnall\u2019s bold visuals combine with precisely calibrated sound and movement to create a coherent double bill in which the two central performances shine.</p> <p>Steadily working his way through bottles of red wine, Malachy looks back with ironic humour over his life as a \u201cbeta male\u201d. As a man who drifted, he watched other men and the women in his life move on, past him, full of plans and ambitions. He didn\u2019t choose to be born, he says; his school years just happened and his decision to go to university was something he did to please his parents.</p> <p>Directed by Rhiann Jeffrey, O\u2019Gorman spins defensive one-liners with the timing of a standup comic, later bringing poignant recognition to the inevitability of loss as the years pass. Gradually, the reasons emerge for Malachy\u2019s present state of mind, in a script by <a href=\"https://www.culturenorthernireland.org/features/performing-arts/culture-ni-was-my-lifeline\">John Patrick Higgins</a> that, while heartfelt, seems overstretched at 55 minutes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45a706f52565fe658b41fbc6f1744ee0cdafd965\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45a706f52565fe658b41fbc6f1744ee0cdafd965/203_175_1797_1078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fractured thoughts \u2026 Ryan McParland in East Belfast Boy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fractured thoughts \u2026 Ryan McParland in East Belfast Boy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ciaran Bagnall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With its abstract setting of a metallic panelled backdrop and stripped wooden floor, Malachy\u2019s room could be in any city anywhere. This is an initial contrast with the second show in the double bill, <strong>East Belfast Boy (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606)</strong>. This high-energy stream of consciousness was developed by Belfast playwright and film-maker Fintan Brady from community workshops with young men in the east inner-city. Conceived as a spoken-word poem, performed by Ryan McParland to the pulsing rhythms of techno, this production relies as much on choreographer <a href=\"https://www.oonadohertyweb.com/hard-to-be-soft\">Oona Doherty</a>\u2019s brilliantly jagged scissor moves and DJ Phil Kieran\u2019s soundtrack as it does on Brady\u2019s text.</p> <p>Initially appearing brash and aggressive, 21-year-old Davy reveals his vulnerability and confusion in bursts, never being able to pin down what he wants. Only in flow, on a drug high while clubbing or playing video games, can he glimpse \u201cthe shape of it\u201d, and find some clarity amid confusion.</p> <p>Director Emma Jordan and lighting designer Sarah Jane Shiels create a fragmented form to match Davy\u2019s semi-articulate phrases, and the effect is powerful and intense.</p> <p>Unemployed, anxious and an insomniac, Davy is a husband and father despite having never consciously chosen either of these things. Reacting to peer pressure, he proposed to his girlfriend of six years without really meaning it. \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d has become one of his refrains, and in this there are echoes of Malachy\u2019s predicament: the recognition that he has always allowed others to dictate his life. Whether that realisation can change anything is the question left hanging in the air.</p> <ul> <li><p>Prime Cut\u2019s double bill is touring until <a href=\"https://www.primecutproductions.co.uk/double-bill-1\">20 February</a>.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Saggy and shuffling, his dressing gown flapping over a middle-aged spread, Malachy is in garrulous confessional mode. His sofa has become an analyst\u2019s couch. This is to be his final reckoning, we realise. Depression has taken a firm hold. Simon O\u2019Gorman brings rueful charm to the role of this solitary man in Every Day I Wake Up Hopeful (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606). It is one of two solo works about male mental health, presented as companion pieces on an extensive cross-border tour of Ireland by Belfast\u2019s Prime Cut Productions, who had a hit in 2016 with Stacey Gregg\u2019s Scorch, in which a teenager grappled with gender identity. \u201cHow did I get here?\u201d is the driving question in both shows, as men attempt to find their way through a fog of confusion. Designer Ciaran Bagnall\u2019s bold visuals combine with precisely calibrated sound and movement to create a coherent double bill in which the two central performances shine. Steadily working his way through bottles of red wine, Malachy looks back with ironic humour over his life as a \u201cbeta male\u201d. As a man who drifted, he watched other men and the women in his life move on, past him, full of plans and ambitions. He didn\u2019t choose to be born, he says; his school years just happened and his decision to go to university was something he did to please his parents. Directed by Rhiann Jeffrey, O\u2019Gorman spins defensive one-liners with the timing of a standup comic, later bringing poignant recognition to the inevitability of loss as the years pass. Gradually, the reasons emerge for Malachy\u2019s present state of mind, in a script by John Patrick Higgins that, while heartfelt, seems overstretched at 55 minutes. With its abstract setting of a metallic panelled backdrop and stripped wooden floor, Malachy\u2019s room could be in any city anywhere. This is an initial contrast with the second show in the double bill, East Belfast Boy (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606). This high-energy stream of consciousness was developed by Belfast playwright and film-maker Fintan Brady from community workshops with young men in the east inner-city. Conceived as a spoken-word poem, performed by Ryan McParland to the pulsing rhythms of techno, this production relies as much on choreographer Oona Doherty\u2019s brilliantly jagged scissor moves and DJ Phil Kieran\u2019s soundtrack as it does on Brady\u2019s text. Initially appearing brash and aggressive, 21-year-old Davy reveals his vulnerability and confusion in bursts, never being able to pin down what he wants. Only in flow, on a drug high while clubbing or playing video games, can he glimpse \u201cthe shape of it\u201d, and find some clarity amid confusion. Director Emma Jordan and lighting designer Sarah Jane Shiels create a fragmented form to match Davy\u2019s semi-articulate phrases, and the effect is powerful and intense. Unemployed, anxious and an insomniac, Davy is a husband and father despite having never consciously chosen either of these things. Reacting to peer pressure, he proposed to his girlfriend of six years without really meaning it. \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d has become one of his refrains, and in this there are echoes of Malachy\u2019s predicament: the recognition that he has always allowed others to dictate his life. Whether that realisation can change anything is the question left hanging in the air. Prime Cut\u2019s double bill is touring until 20 February.",

Olivia Bland ended up crying at the bus stop, after what the 22-year-old describes <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/01/31/graduate-job-row-woman-refuses-job-saying-ceos-interview-technique/\" title=\"\">as being deliberately torn to shreds</a> over everything from her writing skills to her posture (apparently even \u201cmy arms were wrong, and the way I sat was wrong\u201d). Tech company boss Craig Dean, the man on the other side of the desk, ended up posting what he called a \u201csleep-deprived and anxiety-driven\u201d apology on Twitter after her account of it all went viral.</p> <p>Tell me your gender, age and political leanings and I can probably guess with reasonable certainty whether your sympathies lie with her or with him. But if nothing else, the rejection email she sent, explaining where Web Applications UK could stick the job it eventually offered her, certainly demonstrates the \u201ctimely, concise and effective\u201d communications skills stipulated in the job description.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Employers forget how much they too still had to learn in their 20s and more importantly how they learned it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It should be said that Dean\u2019s board of directors later put out a statement, insisting it was confident that there had been \u201cno bullying or intimidation\u201d, while promising to reflect on what had happened.

Olivia Bland ended up crying at the bus stop, after what the 22-year-old describes as being deliberately torn to shreds over everything from her writing skills to her posture (apparently even \u201cmy arms were wrong, and the way I sat was wrong\u201d). Tech company boss Craig Dean, the man on the other side of the desk, ended up posting what he called a \u201csleep-deprived and anxiety-driven\u201d apology on Twitter after her account of it all went viral. Tell me your gender, age and political leanings and I can probably guess with reasonable certainty whether your sympathies lie with her or with him. But if nothing else, the rejection email she sent, explaining where Web Applications UK could stick the job it eventually offered her, certainly demonstrates the \u201ctimely, concise and effective\u201d communications skills stipulated in the job description. It should be said that Dean\u2019s board of directors later put out a statement, insisting it was confident that there had been \u201cno bullying or intimidation\u201d, while promising to reflect on what had happened. But whatever went on inside that interview room, it patently hasn\u2019t ended well for anybody.

      "bodyText": "A public inquiry examining undercover policing is refusing to publish a list of more than 1,000 political groups that have been spied on since 1968. Sir John Mitting, the retired judge heading the inquiry, was urged to publish the list at a preliminary hearing on Thursday by victims of surveillance who are seeking to uncover the extent of the espionage. More than 120 political groups that were spied on by undercover officers have been identified so far. That list was published in October following investigations by the Guardian and the Undercover Research Group, a network of activists that scrutinises police espionage. It suggested that the police spies overwhelmingly monitored leftwing and progressive groups that challenged the status quo, with only three far-right groups infiltrated. The victims of the surveillance have long criticised Mitting for making decisions that will permit the police to cover up misconduct. Mitting has also been criticised for presiding over an inquiry beset by delays. Theresa May, when she was home secretary, set up the inquiry in 2014 to examine the activities of the police spies following a series of controversies. However, the inquiry, which has cost more than \u00a310m, has yet to hear any evidence in public and is not due to conclude before 2023. The delays have been caused mainly by a large number of applications from the police to conceal the identities of its undercover officers. On Tuesday, Mitting announced that the first hearings to examine evidence in public \u2013 due to be held in June \u2013 would be postponed until next year at the earliest. He said the further delays had been caused by a number of issues. One concerned the thousands of individuals named in reports produced by the police spies, along with descriptions of their political activities, and whether privacy laws permitted them to be published by the inquiry. Gerry Facenna, QC for the victims of the surveillance, said the inquiry should publish a database of the groups spied on and then publicise it to alert people that they could have been monitored. Mitting said there were a large number of \u201cone-off\u201d mentions of political groups in the intelligence reports that were not infiltrated by the spies. He said he saw no point in publishing the names of those groups as these mentions may consist of a leaflet from that group or a reference to them at a public meeting. He publishes the names of the main groups infiltrated by the undercover officers when he identifies them, but not the longer list of organisations about which they collected information. The inquiry is due to examine a series of issues including the deception of women by undercover officers in sexual relationships, the monitoring of grieving families, and the theft of dead children\u2019s identities.",

In a statement the parliament urged the bloc\u2019s 28 governments to follow suit and declare Guaid\u00f3 \u201cthe only legitimate interim president\u201d until there were \u201cnew free, transparent and credible presidential elections\u201d.</p> <p>The EU has imposed an arms embargo and sanctions on Venezuelan officials but UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, who arrived on Thursday for a two-day meeting of EU foreign ministers in Bucharest, wants the bloc to impose further targeted sanctions.</p> <p>On Thursday, the Spanish news agency EFE said three of its journalists \u2013 a Spanish reporter, a Colombian photographer and a Colombian TV producer \u2013 who had been detained on Wednesday were being released and deported. Two detained French journalists working for television channel TMC were also released on Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cWe firmly believe that all journalists should be able to exercise their duties and responsibilities and rights in the exercise of their work,\u201d said Federica Mogherini, the EU foreign policy chief, in Bucharest.</p> <p>Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International\u2019s Americas director, said: \u201cThe detention of journalists is a flagrant and deeply concerning attack on freedom of expression and the right to truth \u2026 A free press is fundamental for the defence of human rights in any country in the world.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking on BBC radio, Hunt said a humanitarian catastrophe was unfolding in the country, with citizens struggling to find scraps of food. \u201cWe are not considering sanctions against the whole country because there is a humanitarian situation and we wouldn\u2019t want to make the situation even worse,\u201d he said. \u201cBut targeted sanctions against the kleptocrats who have enriched themselves on the back of the rest of the population who are very poor, that is something I think can be effective.\u201d</p> <p>Key EU countries are prepared to recognise Guaid\u00f3 as the legitimate interim president of Venezuela if Maduro refuses to call fresh elections by Sunday.

      "bodyText": "The European parliament has recognised Venezuela\u2019s opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as de facto head of state, heightening pressure on Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, amid condemnation over the arrest of foreign journalists reporting on the country\u2019s turmoil. MEPs voted 439 in favour to 104 against, with 88 abstentions, at a special session in Brussels to recognise the Venezuelan congress head Guaid\u00f3 as interim leader. In a statement the parliament urged the bloc\u2019s 28 governments to follow suit and declare Guaid\u00f3 \u201cthe only legitimate interim president\u201d until there were \u201cnew free, transparent and credible presidential elections\u201d. The EU has imposed an arms embargo and sanctions on Venezuelan officials but UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, who arrived on Thursday for a two-day meeting of EU foreign ministers in Bucharest, wants the bloc to impose further targeted sanctions. On Thursday, the Spanish news agency EFE said three of its journalists \u2013 a Spanish reporter, a Colombian photographer and a Colombian TV producer \u2013 who had been detained on Wednesday were being released and deported. Two detained French journalists working for television channel TMC were also released on Thursday. \u201cWe firmly believe that all journalists should be able to exercise their duties and responsibilities and rights in the exercise of their work,\u201d said Federica Mogherini, the EU foreign policy chief, in Bucharest. Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International\u2019s Americas director, said: \u201cThe detention of journalists is a flagrant and deeply concerning attack on freedom of expression and the right to truth \u2026 A free press is fundamental for the defence of human rights in any country in the world.\u201d Speaking on BBC radio, Hunt said a humanitarian catastrophe was unfolding in the country, with citizens struggling to find scraps of food. \u201cWe are not considering sanctions against the whole country because there is a humanitarian situation and we wouldn\u2019t want to make the situation even worse,\u201d he said. \u201cBut targeted sanctions against the kleptocrats who have enriched themselves on the back of the rest of the population who are very poor, that is something I think can be effective.\u201d Key EU countries are prepared to recognise Guaid\u00f3 as the legitimate interim president of Venezuela if Maduro refuses to call fresh elections by Sunday. But not every EU state has issued the ultimatum, and Russia is looking to see if these divisions can be prised open. Moscow has so far offered full-throated support for Maduro. It is estimated to have invested \u00a313bn in Venezuela through refinancing of the country\u2019s debt and through oil and arms deals. Members of Maduro\u2019s administration have rejected and ridiculed the EU countries\u2019 ultimatum, the end of which will be marked by a day of pro-opposition protests on Saturday. \u201cThese men from the EU who think Venezuela is a colony have given us eight days to call elections and the deadline runs out on Saturday,\u201d the powerful socialist party leader Diosdado Cabello told a rally in the northern city of Coro on Wednesday. \u201cHow scary. How terribly scary!\u201d Cabello added mockingly. \u201cIs the US going to get involved in an attack against Venezuela?\u201d Maduro has accused Donald Trump and a \u201cgroup of extremists around him\u201d of plotting to topple him in order to seize Venezuela\u2019s oil, and said he risked transforming the country into a new Vietnam. Venezuela\u2019s supreme court has imposed a travel ban and financial restrictions on Guaid\u00f3, including freezing his bank accounts. Guaid\u00f3, 35, a former student leader and head of Venezuela\u2019s opposition-run national assembly, has been at the forefront of a renewed attempt to force Maduro from power. He said in an opinion piece for the New York Times on Wednesday that he had held \u201cclandestine\u201d meetings with the military to try to persuade them to withdraw their support for Maduro. Protesters marched in Caracas on Wednesday calling for Maduro to stand down. In an interview to Spain\u2019s El Pa\u00eds newspaper, Guaid\u00f3 repeated an appeal to Venezuela\u2019s armed forces to take his side. \u201cI am convinced that at a certain moment ... the army will end up manifesting its discontent, and take this opportunity to stand on the side of the constitution. And not only because we propose an amnesty,\u201d he said.

The French justice minister said a large number of those being held were in fact the young children of jihadist fighters. The issue of returning children is being dealt with case by case with the International Red Cross and French authorities. The prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, said he preferred that French jihadists were \u201cjudged, convicted and punished in France rather than disappearing to plan other actions, including against our country.\u201d Politicians on the right and far-right blasted the government for allowing French jihadists to return. Val\u00e9rie Boyer of the rightwing party Les R\u00e9publicains told parliament that the government must \u201cprevent the return of jihadists who betrayed France and fought against our civilisation\u201d. Another rightwing MP suggested what he called the \u201celimination\u201d or targeted assassinations of French jihadists abroad. A French foreign office spokesman said: \u201cThe government\u2019s imperative is the security of French people.\u201d On the situation in Syria, he said: \u201cA part of the territory is still at war, in the north-east, and the American withdrawal risks leading to those terrorists dispersing. So we\u2019re preparing for all eventualities in the north-east, including the eventuality of an expulsion.\u201d",

In the interests of objectivity, I offer you two articles out today showing that, actually, they are bursting with creative ideas.</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/01/31/unicorn-could-make-backstop-vanish-parliament-needs-stick-guns/\">Nick Timothy, Theresa May\u2019s former co-chief of staff, has a solution to the backstop problem in his Telegraph column.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If even an invisible Irish border is unacceptable to the EU, another option is available: a customs territory comprising the UK and Ireland. The republic could remain in the EU but leave its customs union, agreeing instead a common commercial policy including matching tariffs with the UK. This would protect Irish consumers and businesses: the republic imports more from the UK than from any EU country, and the UK is its second biggest European export market. It would also support Irish exports: 85 per cent of its freight trade to the continent uses British ports.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/02/the-eus-hard-border-bluff-will-soon-collapse-and-then-it-can-get-serious-about-brexit/\">Charles Moore in the Spectator is not worried about the threat of food shortages.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What to do about the coming shortage of green groceries of which several supermarkets warned yet again this week if there is a no-deal Brexit on 29 March? I am just old enough to remember when fresh fruit and veg were in short supply at this time of year. People used to know how to store things to mitigate the problem: apples would be carefully laid out on straw-strewn shelves. We ate lots of root vegetables and not much greenery. If ever you saw a strawberry out of season it came, for some reason, from Israel. Perhaps it is time for a Brexit recipe book, like those comforting wartime rationing ones full of bright ideas for dull things. In our part of the south coast we have racier ideas. We have a centuries-old tradition of smuggling (\u2018brandy for the parson, baccy for the clerk\u2019), and are ready to set out in our little ships to Dunkirk or wherever and bring back luscious black-market lettuces and French beans, oranges and lemons. Our Sussex and Kent smugglers used to be known as \u2018free traders\u2019, which is interesting and \u2014 if we have to sneak over an EU tariff wall \u2014 entirely appropriate for today.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c531a91e4b01125b082aa79\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-31T15:56:32.241Z\">3.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from <strong>Mark Rutte</strong>, the Dutch PM.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MinPres/status/1090970310663389185\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Spoke with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JunckerEU?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JunckerEU</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a> now in final fase.

Some Labour MPs are urging colleagues not to be taken in by what they describe as a potential \u201cbribe\u201d. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/31/brexit-latest-news-developments-uk-may-have-to-delay-leaving-eu-jeremy-hunt-admits-politics-live?page=with:block-5c530236e4b01125b082a888#block-5c530236e4b01125b082a888\"> 2.23pm.) </a>And now the TUC has issued a rather critical statement after talks today between trade union and Cabinet Office officials.</p> <p>The talks were triggered by the government\u2019s admission that it wants to offer more guarantees about workers\u2019 rights after Brexit. The Labour MP John Mann tabled an amendment during the main debate on May\u2019s Brexit deal, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/10/brexit-latest-news-corbyn-speech-may-press-conference-reaches-out-to-labour-by-welcoming-workers-rights-amendment-politics-live?page=with:block-5c371ae0e4b02fb91ff11abd#block-5c371ae0e4b02fb91ff11abd\">the government welcomed it. </a>After her deal was defeated, May said offering more on workers\u2019 rights was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/21/brexit-latest-news-mays-statement-mps-commons-deal-will-be-absolute-disaster-says-business-minister-as-may-prepares-to-address-mps-politics-live?page=with:block-5c45edf4e4b058cfe6d94553#block-5c45edf4e4b058cfe6d94553\">one of the three changes she needed to make to get her deal through parliament.</a></p> <p>In his interview on ITV\u2019s Peston last night <strong>Greg Clark,</strong> the business secretary, stressed the importance of getting Labour MPs to support the deal when he said he hoped it would pass by a \u201csubstantial majority\u201d. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If we are to properly move forward I don\u2019t think we should aim for this deal to pass by a majority of one or two, you saw when the referendum result happened, how that didn\u2019t solve \u2026 I would like to see a substantial majority for a deal, that requires understanding.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mathematically, a \u201csubstantial majority\u201d would be impossible without May attracting a hefty chunk of opposition support.</p> <p>But, after today\u2019s talks, the TUC issued a statement implying the government offer on workers\u2019 rights did not go far enough. A TUC spokesperson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unions are always willing to meet with ministers and officials to represent the interests of working people. But we\u2019re not prepared to settle for warm words or half measures from government.</p> <p>Our movement has been clear that working people need a binding guarantee for their rights, now and into the future. We won\u2019t support a Brexit deal which fails this test, and the government has come nowhere close to meeting it.</p> <p>The strongest possible protection for workers\u2019 rights would come from sticking by single market and customs union rules.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-31T15:50:30.552Z\">at 3.50pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c530042e4b0e0e1bbc24576\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-31T15:11:12.713Z\">3.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jeremy Corbyn </strong>has also been giving interviews about Brexit.

Despite saying he was \u201cstoic\u201d and would \u201csee it through\u201d, he was forced to catch a lift to the Kirk Hallam Community Centre from Nottingham to ensure he was not late. Speaking at the bus stop in Nottingham, Mr Corbyn told the Press Association: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ve been waiting 25 minutes for the bus - it was due at 42 (past the hour) and I look over there and it says 11.07am - and it has even disappeared off the information board.

Not just because every analysis, including the government\u2019s own, shows that Brexit will leave us worse off and result in the government having less money to spend, but also because, as the analysis published by the People\u2019s Vote campaign shows, the Brextremists on the Tory benches on whom she is now actively appeasing, will never stand for it.</p> <p>Their real agenda is to slash workers\u2019 rights, to weaken trade unions and to open up our public services to untrammelled market forces.

Theresa May has said that, if there is no new deal by 13 February, she will give MPs a vote on an amendable motion on 14 February, which would allow them a new vote on Cooper-type amendment. But if MPs have voted down a deal by then, would they still get a further vote on an amendable motion, Letwin asked.</p> <p><strong>Andrea Leadsom,</strong> the leader of the Commons, said it was \u201cvery difficult\u201d for her to say what would happen in the event of a deal being voted down for a second time.</p> <p>Given that, ahead of the first vote, MPs voted for an amendment to the business motion that ensured that they did get a vote afterwards on what was going to happen next, it is hard to imagine that not happening again. But the Conservative MP <strong>Nick Boles,</strong> who came up with what ultimately became the Cooper amendment in the first place, said he thought Leadsom\u2019s answer was worrying.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NickBoles/status/1090948559153831937\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Very worrying answer by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andrealeadsom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@andrealeadsom</a> to question from Oliver Letwin in Business Questions.

In this unique session of parliament, and in light of the significant decisions taken by the House this week, it is only right that I give the House notice that there are currently no plans to bring forward a motion to agree dates for the February recess, and that the House may therefore need to continue to sit to make progress on the key business before the House.</p> <p>I realise that this is short notice for colleagues for House staff, but I do think our constituents will expect that the House is able to continue to make progress at this important time. I will endeavour to provide confirmation of the sitting arrangements and business for February as soon as possible.</p> <p>I am very sorry for the inconvenience this will cause to colleagues, House staff and their families. Where House staff are concerned, conversations are underway to ensure that disruption is limited and no one is out of pocket. And where members have family, ministerial or constituency commitments, the usual channels [the party whips] will work hard with members to limit the inconvenience. </p> </blockquote> <p>MPs were expecting the government to cancel the February recess because there is a backlog of legislation that needs to be passed before Brexit, and it is hard to see how there will be time for it all to go through without MPs having to sit longer hours.</p> <p>But what is curious is that, at the moment, most of this legislation cannot be passed because the government does not have a Brexit deal. Today, as she does every Thursday, Leadsom announced the Commons business for next week and, as you can see, it is remarkably light. There is no Brexit legislation on the agenda, and the motions that are being debated certainly don\u2019t need a full four days.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CommonsLeader/status/1090924295323377664\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The business for next week will be: <a href=\"https://t.co/typd105PsP\">pic.twitter.com/typd105PsP</a></p>&mdash; Leader&#39;s Office (@CommonsLeader) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CommonsLeader/status/1090924295323377664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 31, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Ministers want to keep open the option of cancelling the February recess, just in case there is a deal before 14 February.

Amongst Brexiters it is axiomatic that, whatever EU leaders are saying now in public, in practice, when faced with the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, at the last minute Brussels would back down. Pro-Europeans seem inclined to take what EU leaders say at face value, not least because during the Brexit process EU statements have turned out to be a more reliable guide to eventual outcomes than UK government ones. As far as anyone can tell, the Downing Street view seems to be somewhere in the middle; that some \u201cgive\u201d will be possible, but only up to a point.</p> <p>On the Today programme this morning <strong>Sir Martin Donnelly,</strong> a former permanent secretary at the Department for International Trade, was asked for his opinion. Did he think that, when EU leaders rule out renegotiating the withdrawal agreement, we should take them at face value? Yes, he said. He explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This agreement took 18 months of tough, detailed negotiation. It\u2019s over 500 pages of legal text. And that\u2019s really important in the Brussels setting. And now the concrete has set very hard around it. It\u2019s just not possible for any negotiators, however brilliant, to go back and say: \u2018We want to re-open a fundamental part of this deal. We\u2019re not quite sure how exactly we\u2019re going to do that, but it\u2019s very important we do it in a couple of weeks.\u2019 People in Brussels just don\u2019t that that seriously, I\u2019m afraid.</p> </blockquote> <p>Donnelly also said that there would be a \u201cserious paralysis\u201d of parts of the British economy in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is so much just-in-time trade, there is millions of lorries and containers crossing the border, particularly in the Dover choke point every year, it\u2019s just not possible to put in extra controls and expect that system to continue working. Sooner or later, probably in a matter of weeks, there would be serious paralysis of significant parts of the UK economy.</p> <p>There are 10,000 containers a day just for the motor industry, components for example. Then there is all the fresh food. Then there is the fact that, if lorries get stuck in Dover or Calais, then they can\u2019t be moving between Leeds and Manchester. And our transport system is very integrated. So the whole thing just isn\u2019t going to work.</p> </blockquote> <p>When it was put to Donnelly that other ports could take some of the traffic currently going through Dover and Calais, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You have to look at the reality here. I think, if you talk to the Freight Association, if you look at the space in ports, there just isn\u2019t room. There isn\u2019t space in, say, Holyhead for all the traffic that now goes smoothly to Ireland and back ... You can\u2019t just say we will just fix up a few car parks and it will all work. All the evidence is, it won\u2019t.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c52c7d8e4b0e0e1bbc24267\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-31T10:05:20.043Z\">10.05am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Rough sleeping up 13% in London</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More than 4,500 people slept rough on the streets of England last year, according to official figures released after the UK had its coldest night of the winter.

While the SNP have previously relied upon the Scottish Greens, this year a row over council funding means their support is still wavering.</p> <p>Indeed, the Scotsman is reporting this morning that Nicola Sturgeon has warned her party to prepare for a possible Scottish election if the Holyrood government fails to pass its budget today. <a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/key-snp-figures-told-by-sturgeon-to-prepare-for-possible-election-1-4865211\">According to the Scotsman</a>, during a meeting of the SNP group at Westminster attended by Sturgeon on Monday, she warned her MPs that they should prepare for a snap Holyrood election if the SNP government fails to get its budget through. This adds to speculation that Sturgeon may seek a fresh mandate from the electorate to secure another referendum on independence, as she prepares to reveal her plans in the coming weeks.</p> <p>The Scottish Green\u2019s <strong>Andy Wightman</strong> was on BBC Radio Scotland this morning insisting that his party were not being \u201cobstructive\u201d. Although they have the promise of legislation by the end of this parliament and a green light for a local tourist tax, the sticking point remains their call for a hefty increase in spending on local government this year.

And we will do that.</p> <p>Secondly, we have to show that any solution that changes the backstop won\u2019t lead to us trying to access the single market by the back door. And we recognise that the way that we access the single market, because we are not going to be embracing free movement, will change.</p> <p>If we can overcome those two issues, which I think we can, then I think we will be able to have substantive discussions.</p> <p>But this is not going to happen in the next few days. We have to put these proposals together, we have to work them up, we have to go through them in detail with our partners in the EU.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is significant because Theresa May has already said that, if no deal is reached by Wednesday 13 February, she will make a statement to MPs, and table an amendable motion to be debated the following day (ie, a fortnight today). Hunt\u2019s comments implied that he does not expected a deal before then, and that the debate will go ahead. The EU has already made it clear, from its reaction to the Commons votes on Tuesday, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/30/theresa-may-can-no-longer-be-trusted-european-press-condemns-pm\">it is not about to offer a compromise</a> and today\u2019s Times even says that \u201cAngela Merkel will \u2018go to the edge of the precipice\u2019 with Theresa May as the European Union prepares to reject any change to the withdrawal agreement in time for a crucial vote in two weeks.\u201d <strong>Bruno Waterfield</strong>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/merkel-will-push-britain-to-the-brink-in-brexit-showdown-with-may-nlr3kwzgp\">story (paywall) </a>goes on: \u201cDiplomatic sources said the German chancellor believed that people needed \u2018to look into the abyss before a deal is done at five to midnight \u2014 that is how she works\u2019.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><strong>Hunt refused to back what Greg Clark, the business secretary told ITV\u2019s Peston programme last night about technical solutions to the Irish border problem being unavailable</strong>. The UK government is calling for \u201calternative arrangements\u201d to the backstop, and one option would using new technology to avoid the need for physical controls at the border. But Clark told Peston last night that he did not think these solutions were available. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve visited the border between Norway and Sweden, one country outside the EU, one country inside, they do have physical checks there. So I myself don\u2019t see [a technological solution] being currently available but I don\u2019t want to pour cold water on an attempt by people who are on different sides of the argument to come together to try to find a way forward.</p> </blockquote> <p>When Hunt was asked if he agreed, he refused to endorse what Clark said. Instead he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Clark] has got a view, and lots of people have got a view.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Hunt said the idea that the government was not committed to the Good Friday agrement was \u201cdistressing\u201d and \u201cnonsense\u201d.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have to show the EU, and show Ireland, that our commitment to the Belfast, Good Friday agreement, is absolutely unconditional. In fact, it is quite distressing for people like me and you, who grew up in the 1980s with bombs going off in Harrods or in Hyde Park and all over the country - any suggestion that we would ever waver in our support for the peace process, which was the greatest achievement of both John Major and Tony Blair, is absolute nonsense.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hunt was responding to <strong>Ian Blackford</strong>, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, saying <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2019-01-29/debates/BB8A5769-12B4-4D0E-9B4E-158F89F9FCDE/EuropeanUnion(Withdrawal)Act2018\">on Tuesday night</a> that the vote calling for an alternative to the backstop showed that the Conservative party had \u201ceffectively ripped apart the Good Friday agreement\u201d.

This is not, of itself, a startling observation - in Brussels this has been the working assumption for some time - but it is not something that anyone at the top of government has ever said this bluntly before. Whenever Theresa May gets asked about the prospect of article 50 being delayed, she either says the UK is leaving on 29 March, period, or, in her more candid moments, says that this is not an option being considered. But on the Today programme this morning <strong>Jeremy Hunt,</strong> the foreign secretary, was much more direct. When it was put to him that it was \u201clikely\u201d that Brexit would have to be delayed, he did not challenge the premise of the question. Instead he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think that depends on how long this process takes. </p> <p>I think it is true that if we ended up approving a deal in the days before the 29th March, then we might need some extra time to pass critical legislation.

EU officials fear Theresa May is setting the UK on course for a no-deal exit at the end of June because she will not have the political courage to ask for the longer Brexit delay they believe she needs. The SNP has struck a deal with the Greens to pass the Scottish government\u2019s budget, as the BBC reports. France, Germany and Britain have set up a financial mechanism designed to avoid US sanctions against Iran and keep the 2015 nuclear deal afloat. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. We plan to keep them open until about 5.30pm. In the comments BTL readers often complain that Brexiters don\u2019t have solutions to the problems generated by the vote to leave the EU in 2016 that they supported. In the interests of objectivity, I offer you two articles out today showing that, actually, they are bursting with creative ideas. Nick Timothy, Theresa May\u2019s former co-chief of staff, has a solution to the backstop problem in his Telegraph column. If even an invisible Irish border is unacceptable to the EU, another option is available: a customs territory comprising the UK and Ireland. The republic could remain in the EU but leave its customs union, agreeing instead a common commercial policy including matching tariffs with the UK. This would protect Irish consumers and businesses: the republic imports more from the UK than from any EU country, and the UK is its second biggest European export market. It would also support Irish exports: 85 per cent of its freight trade to the continent uses British ports. Charles Moore in the Spectator is not worried about the threat of food shortages. What to do about the coming shortage of green groceries of which several supermarkets warned yet again this week if there is a no-deal Brexit on 29 March? I am just old enough to remember when fresh fruit and veg were in short supply at this time of year. People used to know how to store things to mitigate the problem: apples would be carefully laid out on straw-strewn shelves. We ate lots of root vegetables and not much greenery. If ever you saw a strawberry out of season it came, for some reason, from Israel. Perhaps it is time for a Brexit recipe book, like those comforting wartime rationing ones full of bright ideas for dull things. In our part of the south coast we have racier ideas. We have a centuries-old tradition of smuggling (\u2018brandy for the parson, baccy for the clerk\u2019), and are ready to set out in our little ships to Dunkirk or wherever and bring back luscious black-market lettuces and French beans, oranges and lemons. Our Sussex and Kent smugglers used to be known as \u2018free traders\u2019, which is interesting and \u2014 if we have to sneak over an EU tariff wall \u2014 entirely appropriate for today. This is from Mark Rutte, the Dutch PM. EU officials fear Theresa May is setting the UK on course for a no-deal exit at the end of June because she will not have the political courage to ask for the longer Brexit delay they believe she needs, my colleague Daniel Boffey reports. Downing Street\u2019s attempts to win over Labour/left support for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal seems to be running into some resistance. Some Labour MPs are urging colleagues not to be taken in by what they describe as a potential \u201cbribe\u201d. (See 2.23pm.) And now the TUC has issued a rather critical statement after talks today between trade union and Cabinet Office officials. The talks were triggered by the government\u2019s admission that it wants to offer more guarantees about workers\u2019 rights after Brexit. The Labour MP John Mann tabled an amendment during the main debate on May\u2019s Brexit deal, and the government welcomed it. After her deal was defeated, May said offering more on workers\u2019 rights was one of the three changes she needed to make to get her deal through parliament. In his interview on ITV\u2019s Peston last night Greg Clark, the business secretary, stressed the importance of getting Labour MPs to support the deal when he said he hoped it would pass by a \u201csubstantial majority\u201d. He said: If we are to properly move forward I don\u2019t think we should aim for this deal to pass by a majority of one or two, you saw when the referendum result happened, how that didn\u2019t solve \u2026 I would like to see a substantial majority for a deal, that requires understanding. Mathematically, a \u201csubstantial majority\u201d would be impossible without May attracting a hefty chunk of opposition support. But, after today\u2019s talks, the TUC issued a statement implying the government offer on workers\u2019 rights did not go far enough. A TUC spokesperson said: Unions are always willing to meet with ministers and officials to represent the interests of working people. But we\u2019re not prepared to settle for warm words or half measures from government. Our movement has been clear that working people need a binding guarantee for their rights, now and into the future. We won\u2019t support a Brexit deal which fails this test, and the government has come nowhere close to meeting it. The strongest possible protection for workers\u2019 rights would come from sticking by single market and customs union rules. Jeremy Corbyn has also been giving interviews about Brexit. Asked if he thought that Theresa May was listening to his ideas when they met yesterday afternoon to discuss Brexit, he replied: Well, she was sitting opposite me and somebody next to her was making notes of what I said and somebody sitting next to me was making notes on what she said - so I hope she was listening. I set out quite clearly what I thought was a credible way forward, which is to negotiate a comprehensive customs union with the EU to protect our trade interests and our jobs, our access to the market and, crucially, legally-binding protections of consumer, environmental and workers\u2019 rights. Jeremy Corbyn was forced to take a car to Derbyshire to speak about cuts to bus services - after the one he was waiting on failed to show up. As the Press Association reports, Corbyn met residents and community leaders in Ilkeston on Friday and planned to use a service that had suffered from a reduction in funding. Despite saying he was \u201cstoic\u201d and would \u201csee it through\u201d, he was forced to catch a lift to the Kirk Hallam Community Centre from Nottingham to ensure he was not late. Speaking at the bus stop in Nottingham, Mr Corbyn told the Press Association: We\u2019ve been waiting 25 minutes for the bus - it was due at 42 (past the hour) and I look over there and it says 11.07am - and it has even disappeared off the information board. So I don\u2019t know what has happened to this bus but we\u2019re stoic, we\u2019ll wait, we\u2019ll see it through. But I think this kind of proves our point about private operators running buses and not doing it terribly well. Derek Mackay, the Scottish government\u2019s finance minister, says he has struck a deal with the Scottish Greens to get his budget through Holyrood. (See 9.51am and 2.01pm.) And here is the BBC\u2019s Sarah Smith on the deal. The Labour MP Wes Streeting says his colleagues should not be tempted by the suggestion that, if they vote for the Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, the government will increase spending on their communities. (See 12.26pm.) In a statement issued by the People\u2019s Vote campaign, which wants a second referendum, he said: Today the Downing Street spin machine has briefed journalists that the government would consider offering extra money to coalfield communities and a strengthening of workers\u2019 rights if Labour MPs voted for Brexit. It\u2019s a promise not worth the newsprint it is printed on. Not just because every analysis, including the government\u2019s own, shows that Brexit will leave us worse off and result in the government having less money to spend, but also because, as the analysis published by the People\u2019s Vote campaign shows, the Brextremists on the Tory benches on whom she is now actively appeasing, will never stand for it. Their real agenda is to slash workers\u2019 rights, to weaken trade unions and to open up our public services to untrammelled market forces. They are fully paid-up members of the Donald Trump fan club and committed enemies of any social dimension in market regulation and service provision. For Labour MPs to align themselves with the likes of Boris Johnson, Iain Duncan Smith and Priti Patel on Brexit would be a mistake that would rank alongside Ramsay MacDonald\u2019s 1931 creation of a \u2018national\u2019 government. It would never be forgiven and never be forgivable. The Labour MP David Lammy has posted a more succinct version of the same response on Twitter. And the Labour MP Anna Turley has also condemned what the government is reported to be planning. Also just published is the Department for Education\u2019s no-deal advice to universities, most of it involving who is eligible for study and financing via student loans, including EU citizens already in the UK and those wanting to come after Brexit. One interesting nugget in the advice is: \u201cEntitlement to student finance and home fees status for EU students starting a course at an English institution in academic years after the 2019 to 2020 academic year, is under consideration.\u201d Should the UK\u2019s exit be delayed, that leaves open the possibility that universities may be able to recruit EU-based students and offer home tuition fees backed by student loans, for at least one more year. Jeremy Hunt admitted that article 50 may have to be extended to avoid the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal on 29 March, earning him a rebuke from Downing Street even though his comments were technically correct. MPs will be expected to sit over the planned week-long February recess in an attempt to keep up with Brexit legislation, the Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, has said \u2013 while also announcing an entirely Brexit-free programme for next week. Emergency \u201ctrauma packs\u201d flown into the UK during terrorist attacks are being stockpiled on British soil by the pharmaceutical giant Johnson &amp; Johnson over concerns of a risk to life from border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The Department for Education has said that schools may need to be flexible about what goes into pupils\u2019 meals in the event of a no-deal Brexit. (See 1.31pm.) The leader of Ukip has formally written to the Queen, asking her to suspend parliament until after 29 March to ensure MPs cannot thwart Brexit. Annual house price growth almost ground to a halt in January as fears over Brexit deterred buyers, according to Britain\u2019s biggest building society. The justice secretary, David Gauke, has said the state of safety in prisons is \u201cdisturbing\u201d as figures revealed a surge in deaths, assaults and self-harm behind bars. Overcrowding in social housing has increased to the highest level since government records began 24 years ago with more than 300,000 households in England squeezed into too few rooms, official figures have revealed. With just an hour to go until the debate on the Scottish budget (see 9.51am), it was confirmed talks are still taking place between Derek Mackay, the Scottish government\u2019s finance secretary, and the Scottish Greens, the Press Association reports. A government source said: \u201cWe will hopefully get a deal by the end of the day, but we will see where we get to.\u201d Discussions over the last 48 hours have been \u201cintense\u201d, he added, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re not taking anything for granted but we are hopeful we can reach agreement.\u201d With improved funding for local government one of the key demands from the Greens, the source said ministers are \u201cvery open\u201d to the idea of allowing councils to introduce a levy on hotel rooms. Some light relief ... First minister\u2019s questions in the Holyrood chamber focused on concerns about a third infection outbreak in a Glasgow hospital, which has been linked to the deaths of two premature babies, and homelessness. There was a brief mention of the budget \u2013 to be voted on later and as yet the SNP\u2019s minority government has not found the support it needs to pass its spending plans \u2013 with Nicola Sturgeon saying she was \u201chopeful\u201d that a deal would be reached in time with the Scottish Greens. Earlier in the day, the deputy first minister John Swinney confirmed the suspension of an inquiry into whether Nicola Sturgeon broke the ministerial code during the Scottish government\u2019s investigation into sexual harassment allegations made against Alex Salmond. He said it had been agreed that the inquiry, which will be led by Ireland\u2019s former chief prosecutor James Hamilton, should be deferred while criminal investigations against Salmond are active. He added that the Scottish government\u2019s review of the application of its procedure for handling complaints about ministers or former ministers would also \u201cnot be progressed at this stage\u201d. Sturgeon referred herself for investigation earlier this month after questions over whether she had breached the code by failing to declare five meetings and phone calls with Salmond last year. Schools may need to be \u201cflexible\u201d to provide school lunches in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Department for Education has told schools and colleges in England in its EU exit advice note out today. It says: The government, including the Department for Education, will continue to work with food suppliers to prepare for a no deal departure from the EU. Schools have significant flexibilities within the school food standards. Local authorities and schools must exercise their power to provide meals to all registered pupils who request one. The DfE\u2019s advice means schools could ignore guidelines on nutrition and content if there are shortages, rewinding Jamie Oliver\u2019s good work and suggesting it could be back to processed potato waffles and chicken nuggets for British school children. Schools are also told that hiring teachers from abroad will get more difficult because their qualifications may not be automatically recognised. \u201cIn a no deal scenario, the current system of reciprocal recognition of professional qualifications between the EU, EEA EFTA and Switzerland and the UK will not apply after 29 March 2019,\u201d the department states, although teachers who have already had their qualifications recognised in the UK will not be affected. For school trips, the DfE notes that there are \u201ca number of issues you will need to be aware of when planning travel to the EU for staff or students,\u201d including passport duration. During business questions in the Commons Sir Oliver Letwin, one of the Conservative MPs who supported the Yvette Cooper amendment intended to give MPs the chance to firmly block a no-deal Brexit, asked what would happen if another government Brexit deal gets voted down by 13 February. Theresa May has said that, if there is no new deal by 13 February, she will give MPs a vote on an amendable motion on 14 February, which would allow them a new vote on Cooper-type amendment. But if MPs have voted down a deal by then, would they still get a further vote on an amendable motion, Letwin asked. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said it was \u201cvery difficult\u201d for her to say what would happen in the event of a deal being voted down for a second time. Given that, ahead of the first vote, MPs voted for an amendment to the business motion that ensured that they did get a vote afterwards on what was going to happen next, it is hard to imagine that not happening again. But the Conservative MP Nick Boles, who came up with what ultimately became the Cooper amendment in the first place, said he thought Leadsom\u2019s answer was worrying. The announcement that the Commons recess may be cancelled coincided with the publication today of a report from the Institute for Government (pdf) looking at whether the government is ready for a no-deak Brexit. The IfG says it is \u201cincreasingly unlikely\u201d that all the legislation could pass in time. It says: It looks increasingly unlikely that the prime minister will be able to get the six outstanding Brexit bills through parliament in time. Some of the major bills still have not started their Lords stages \u2013 where the government does not control time. Any piece of legislation can become a target for people wanting to frustrate the government\u2019s intentions. The government is also behind on secondary legislation. Despite a major push from government departments, only around 100 of the 600 statutory instruments required for a no deal Brexit have made their way through parliament.Almost half are yet to be tabled Legislation can theoretically be rushed through parliament, but that would bypass important scrutiny and, most importantly, require a stable majority \u2013 something the government cannot currently bank on. That means there is a very significant risk that the laws that need to be in place for a no deal Brexit will not be on the statute book. Overall, the report is damning. Bronwen Maddox, the IfG\u2019s director, told the BBC that the UK is \u201cnot ready for no deal\u201d, adding: The disruption from no deal - simply from the lack of preparation - would be extremely damaging. It cannot be dismissed as a mere blip. Jeremy Corbyn has been visiting Ilkeston today. Asked about the reports about the government proposing to shovel cash at Labour leave areas in the hope of getting extra votes for the Brexit deal (see 12.26pm), he said he would be happy to see these communities get more investment, but that this would be more likely under a Labour government. He said: I think they should look at the needs of their constituencies - of course, every MP should do that and demand appropriate resources for their constituencies. Many, particularly from mining areas, have been disgracefully treated by this Tory government and indeed previous ones - ever since the miners\u2019 strike in the 1980s. Clearly, there has to be investment in those communities - but the Brexit plan proposed by Theresa May doesn\u2019t solve that any more than the government\u2019s austerity programme is going to solve any of that. I simply say to people, if you voted leave or voted remain, your need for a government who will invest in your communities are exactly the same - we need a government that is going to invest in communities and create good-quality, secure jobs. Corbyn also rejected the suggestion that Labour\u2019s opposition to the government\u2019s Brexit policy had been ineffective. As the Press Association reports, when asked why he thought Labour had not laid a glove on the government despite the difficulties the Tories were in, he replied: Hang on, they were defeated on a notion from us on contempt of parliament. They were defeated on their Brexit plan, they were forced to hold a meaningful vote by Labour action. They were forced to bring forward proposals to grant a European Union citizen\u2019s right to stay in Britain. That is Labour taking them to task in parliament, the fact that the media choose not to report what Labour says is not my fault. At the lobby briefing this morning the prime minister\u2019s spokesman also dismissed Jeremy Hunt\u2019s suggestion that article 50 may be delayed. (See 8.57am.) Asked about Hunt\u2019s comment, the spokesman said the government was \u201cdetermined\u201d to ensure all arrangements were in place for the UK to leave on time. He went on: The prime minister\u2019s position on this is unchanged. We are leaving on March 29. This morning the Times splashed with a story (paywall) saying the government is exploring the idea of promising to spend money on leave-voting former mining communities in the hope of getting some of the Labour MPs who represent those areas to back Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. The paper reports: The prime minister\u2019s allies believe that she needs the backing of about 20 Labour MPs for a modified agreement to offset the number of Tory rebels, even if she wins the support of the DUP. Potential Labour backers are now being wooed with the promise of local investment as Downing Street increases efforts to build a parliamentary majority before a second vote. \u201cThere\u2019s a willingness to look again at coalfield communities and make good the promises that former Labour governments failed to deliver,\u201d a well-placed government source said. \u201cIt\u2019s about allowing Labour MPs representing Brexit communities to show that they have extracted something tangible in return for their vote. And, frankly, it\u2019s not an unreasonable ask.\u201d One of those involved in the negotiations said that Downing Street was pressing for details of potential investments. \u201cWe are being asked to get all our demands in as soon as possible. There is a real urgency about this all of a sudden.\u201d At the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning the prime minister\u2019s spokesman rejected the idea that this amounted to \u201ccash for votes\u201d. When this was put to him, he replied: \u201cI absolutely wouldn\u2019t characterise it like that.\u201d But otherwise he was happy to confirm that the government was considering pumping money into these areas. The spokesman said: The prime minister has a long-standing commitment to tackling inequality between communities. We are determined to lead a programme of national renewal post-Brexit by rebuilding and reconnecting communities, driving prosperity and unleashing the potential and creativity of hard-working people in every part of our country. No community should feel that they are left behind. The Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes says government MPs may be on a one-line whip during the February recess. A one-line whip means MPs don\u2019t have to turn up. Like me (see 11.15am), he suspects this may just be about ensuring that the government does not get criticised for letting MPs take a holiday at a time of crisis. This is what Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, told MPs about the prospect of the February recess being cancelled. She said: The House will know that recess dates are always announced subject to the progress of business. In this unique session of parliament, and in light of the significant decisions taken by the House this week, it is only right that I give the House notice that there are currently no plans to bring forward a motion to agree dates for the February recess, and that the House may therefore need to continue to sit to make progress on the key business before the House. I realise that this is short notice for colleagues for House staff, but I do think our constituents will expect that the House is able to continue to make progress at this important time. I will endeavour to provide confirmation of the sitting arrangements and business for February as soon as possible. I am very sorry for the inconvenience this will cause to colleagues, House staff and their families. Where House staff are concerned, conversations are underway to ensure that disruption is limited and no one is out of pocket. And where members have family, ministerial or constituency commitments, the usual channels [the party whips] will work hard with members to limit the inconvenience. MPs were expecting the government to cancel the February recess because there is a backlog of legislation that needs to be passed before Brexit, and it is hard to see how there will be time for it all to go through without MPs having to sit longer hours. But what is curious is that, at the moment, most of this legislation cannot be passed because the government does not have a Brexit deal. Today, as she does every Thursday, Leadsom announced the Commons business for next week and, as you can see, it is remarkably light. There is no Brexit legislation on the agenda, and the motions that are being debated certainly don\u2019t need a full four days. Ministers want to keep open the option of cancelling the February recess, just in case there is a deal before 14 February. But, based on what Jeremy Hunt was saying this morning (see 9.44am), that seems highly unlikely. But Leadsom seemed to imply that the recess would be abandoned, regardless of whether or not there was a deal. Why? She may have given it away when she said: \u201cOur constituents will expect that the House is able to continue to make progress at this important time.\u201d Even if there is no Brexit legislation ready to pass in the February half-term, MPs are like to be sitting in the chamber anyway to convey the impression they are taking the crisis seriously. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has just announced in business questions that the government may have to cancel the February recess. She said it was important for parliament to be able to make progress at this time. She apologised for the inconvenience to MPs, and to staff who work in the Commons. MPs were due to start their half-term recess after Thursday 14 February, and return to the Commons on Monday 25 February. One of the great unknowns in British politics at the moment is whether or not the EU would be willing to re-open the Brexit deal. Amongst Brexiters it is axiomatic that, whatever EU leaders are saying now in public, in practice, when faced with the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, at the last minute Brussels would back down. Pro-Europeans seem inclined to take what EU leaders say at face value, not least because during the Brexit process EU statements have turned out to be a more reliable guide to eventual outcomes than UK government ones. As far as anyone can tell, the Downing Street view seems to be somewhere in the middle; that some \u201cgive\u201d will be possible, but only up to a point. On the Today programme this morning Sir Martin Donnelly, a former permanent secretary at the Department for International Trade, was asked for his opinion. Did he think that, when EU leaders rule out renegotiating the withdrawal agreement, we should take them at face value? Yes, he said. He explained: This agreement took 18 months of tough, detailed negotiation. It\u2019s over 500 pages of legal text. And that\u2019s really important in the Brussels setting. And now the concrete has set very hard around it. It\u2019s just not possible for any negotiators, however brilliant, to go back and say: \u2018We want to re-open a fundamental part of this deal. We\u2019re not quite sure how exactly we\u2019re going to do that, but it\u2019s very important we do it in a couple of weeks.\u2019 People in Brussels just don\u2019t that that seriously, I\u2019m afraid. Donnelly also said that there would be a \u201cserious paralysis\u201d of parts of the British economy in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He said: There is so much just-in-time trade, there is millions of lorries and containers crossing the border, particularly in the Dover choke point every year, it\u2019s just not possible to put in extra controls and expect that system to continue working. Sooner or later, probably in a matter of weeks, there would be serious paralysis of significant parts of the UK economy. There are 10,000 containers a day just for the motor industry, components for example. Then there is all the fresh food. Then there is the fact that, if lorries get stuck in Dover or Calais, then they can\u2019t be moving between Leeds and Manchester. And our transport system is very integrated. So the whole thing just isn\u2019t going to work. When it was put to Donnelly that other ports could take some of the traffic currently going through Dover and Calais, he replied: You have to look at the reality here. I think, if you talk to the Freight Association, if you look at the space in ports, there just isn\u2019t room. There isn\u2019t space in, say, Holyhead for all the traffic that now goes smoothly to Ireland and back ... You can\u2019t just say we will just fix up a few car parks and it will all work. All the evidence is, it won\u2019t. More than 4,500 people slept rough on the streets of England last year, according to official figures released after the UK had its coldest night of the winter. As the Press Association reports, local authorities estimated around 4,677 people slept rough on a single night last autumn, according to data (pdf) from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG). This was up 2,909 since comparable records begun in 2010, but marked the first decrease of the decade, with a 2% drop since 2017. Despite the fall across England, London saw a 13% increase with 1,283 sleeping on the streets. While Brexit machinations continue at Westminster, Thursday at Holyrood sees the first parliamentary vote on the SNP\u2019s budget, with cross-party negotiations ongoing to muster enough support to pass the SNP minority government\u2019s plans. While the SNP have previously relied upon the Scottish Greens, this year a row over council funding means their support is still wavering. Indeed, the Scotsman is reporting this morning that Nicola Sturgeon has warned her party to prepare for a possible Scottish election if the Holyrood government fails to pass its budget today. According to the Scotsman, during a meeting of the SNP group at Westminster attended by Sturgeon on Monday, she warned her MPs that they should prepare for a snap Holyrood election if the SNP government fails to get its budget through. This adds to speculation that Sturgeon may seek a fresh mandate from the electorate to secure another referendum on independence, as she prepares to reveal her plans in the coming weeks. The Scottish Green\u2019s Andy Wightman was on BBC Radio Scotland this morning insisting that his party were not being \u201cobstructive\u201d. Although they have the promise of legislation by the end of this parliament and a green light for a local tourist tax, the sticking point remains their call for a hefty increase in spending on local government this year. It\u2019s going to be a long day at Holyrood. Here is a full summary of what Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said in his Today programme interview about Brexit. Hunt admitted that Brexit may have to be delayed. (See 8.57am.) He played down prospects for the UK being able to put new proposals to the EU for resolving the backstop anytime soon. Speaking about the next steps for the government, he said: The first thing we have to do is demonstrate that our commitment to the Belfast agreement, the Good Friday agreement, is absolute. And we will do that. Secondly, we have to show that any solution that changes the backstop won\u2019t lead to us trying to access the single market by the back door. And we recognise that the way that we access the single market, because we are not going to be embracing free movement, will change. If we can overcome those two issues, which I think we can, then I think we will be able to have substantive discussions. But this is not going to happen in the next few days. We have to put these proposals together, we have to work them up, we have to go through them in detail with our partners in the EU. This is significant because Theresa May has already said that, if no deal is reached by Wednesday 13 February, she will make a statement to MPs, and table an amendable motion to be debated the following day (ie, a fortnight today). Hunt\u2019s comments implied that he does not expected a deal before then, and that the debate will go ahead. The EU has already made it clear, from its reaction to the Commons votes on Tuesday, that it is not about to offer a compromise and today\u2019s Times even says that \u201cAngela Merkel will \u2018go to the edge of the precipice\u2019 with Theresa May as the European Union prepares to reject any change to the withdrawal agreement in time for a crucial vote in two weeks.\u201d Bruno Waterfield\u2019s story (paywall) goes on: \u201cDiplomatic sources said the German chancellor believed that people needed \u2018to look into the abyss before a deal is done at five to midnight \u2014 that is how she works\u2019.\u201d Hunt refused to back what Greg Clark, the business secretary told ITV\u2019s Peston programme last night about technical solutions to the Irish border problem being unavailable. The UK government is calling for \u201calternative arrangements\u201d to the backstop, and one option would using new technology to avoid the need for physical controls at the border. But Clark told Peston last night that he did not think these solutions were available. He said: I\u2019ve visited the border between Norway and Sweden, one country outside the EU, one country inside, they do have physical checks there. So I myself don\u2019t see [a technological solution] being currently available but I don\u2019t want to pour cold water on an attempt by people who are on different sides of the argument to come together to try to find a way forward. When Hunt was asked if he agreed, he refused to endorse what Clark said. Instead he said: [Clark] has got a view, and lots of people have got a view. Hunt said the idea that the government was not committed to the Good Friday agrement was \u201cdistressing\u201d and \u201cnonsense\u201d. He said: We have to show the EU, and show Ireland, that our commitment to the Belfast, Good Friday agreement, is absolutely unconditional. In fact, it is quite distressing for people like me and you, who grew up in the 1980s with bombs going off in Harrods or in Hyde Park and all over the country - any suggestion that we would ever waver in our support for the peace process, which was the greatest achievement of both John Major and Tony Blair, is absolute nonsense. Hunt was responding to Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, saying on Tuesday night that the vote calling for an alternative to the backstop showed that the Conservative party had \u201ceffectively ripped apart the Good Friday agreement\u201d. This claim has clearly infuriated Tory MPs, who repeatedly raised it in the Commons chamber yesterday. Brexit may have to be delayed, a senior member of the government has now admitted. This is not, of itself, a startling observation - in Brussels this has been the working assumption for some time - but it is not something that anyone at the top of government has ever said this bluntly before. Whenever Theresa May gets asked about the prospect of article 50 being delayed, she either says the UK is leaving on 29 March, period, or, in her more candid moments, says that this is not an option being considered. But on the Today programme this morning Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, was much more direct. When it was put to him that it was \u201clikely\u201d that Brexit would have to be delayed, he did not challenge the premise of the question. Instead he replied: I think that depends on how long this process takes. I think it is true that if we ended up approving a deal in the days before the 29th March, then we might need some extra time to pass critical legislation. But if we are able to make progress sooner then, that might not be necessary. We can\u2019t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen. I will post more from his interview soon. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Annual figures on rough sleeping are published. 10.10m: Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, takes questions in the Commons. 10.15am: Jeremy Corbyn holds a meeting in Ilkeston focusing on bus services. After 10.30am: Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, takes business questions in the Commons. 11.30am: Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary, speaks at the doteveryone conference. 2.30pm: MSPs start debating the Scottish government\u2019s budget. As the BBC reports, it is in danger of being voted down. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I finish, at around 5pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads.

      "bodyText": "Spotify\u2019s recent introduction of a mute button might come across as just another innocuous tech feature rollout. But while it was added without fanfare, the timing \u2013 as many commentators have pointed out \u2013 is striking. The \u201cdon\u2019t play this artist\u201d button, which drives the application to skip songs by an artist of your choice wherever they appear, has been introduced in the wake of dream hampton\u2019s explosive documentary, which delves into allegations that Kelly has been abusing women of colour \u2013 some whom were underage \u2013 for decades. While Kelly continues to deny allegations, and he has never been criminally charged, the attention drawn to them this decade \u2013 by way of a 2013 interview with Jim DeRogatis, who had been covering the story doggedly since the early 2000s; a 2017 Buzzfeed investigation; various activist movements led by women of colour; and finally the documentary \u2013 has led to widespread outrage against not just Kelly, but the companies that continue to profit from his music. The #MuteRKelly campaign began trending on Twitter in 2017, leading to a series of cancelled concerts, and now a petition calling for Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube to drop his music has gathered more than 160,000 signatures. It\u2019s into this arena that the mute button arrives. The timing may or may not be a coincidence; any company managing a piece of software as complex and widely used as Spotify will at any moment be juggling a slew of feature requests and bug reports. But while Spotify has not commented on its motivation, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time that it has altered its offering in response to complaints about Kelly. In May last year, after Time\u2019s Up\u2019s women of colour subcommittee lent their support to the #MuteRKelly campaign, the company removed his songs from its playlist algorithms \u2013 part of the abortive implementation of a policy on \u201chate content and hateful conduct\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t censor content because of an artist\u2019s or creator\u2019s behavior, but we want our editorial decisions ... to reflect our values,\u201d Spotify said at the time. \u201cWhen an artist or creator does something that is especially harmful or hateful ... it may affect the ways we work with or support that artist or creator.\u201d The decision was reversed a month later. As Vulture\u2019s Dee Lockett explains, Spotify\u2019s implementation of the mute button this month seems to have again been driven by activist groups \u2013 this time Color of Change, a US nonprofit that describes itself as a racial justice organisation, which has been pushing for Kelly\u2019s complete removal from the streaming platform.

      "bodyText": "The federal Coalition\u2019s peak policy body for deciding issues relating to fuel emissions and electric cars has met 12 times in its four-year existence but minutes for five of these meetings cannot be found. The revelations emerged during a public hearing of the Senate select committee on electric vehicles held last year when a member of the department of infrastructure, regional development and cities struggled to name the chair of the ministerial forum on vehicles emissions. When asked by Senator Rex Patrick of the Centre Alliance whether the forum kept minutes of its meetings, Alex Foulds, executive director of the department\u2019s surface transport policy division, replied: \u201cNo, they don\u2019t produce minutes as such.\u201d Foulds told the hearing that the ministerial forum had met three times since it was set up \u201cwithout [departmental] officials and with officials\u201d. \u201cHow do you know what happens there?\u201d Senator Patrick asked. \u201cThis is a most unusual procedure for government \u2013 for government officials to meet and not take minutes, a record. That\u2019s really quite strange.\u201d In a letter of correction sent in September, Foulds amended his evidence to say that while the \u201cofficial stakeholder consultation\u201d forums had met three times, the forum has met on nine other occasions, or 12 in total. Following up through FOI, Senator Patrick\u2019s office obtained just three sets of minutes, some in the form of \u201chastily\u201d draft notes sent via email, leaving the others unaccounted for. A messy back-and-forth then occurred between the Senate committee and the department which ended with some form of notes being found for all but five meetings of the forum \u2013 those where departmental officials were not in attendance. The department did not arrange to be sent copies of records from those meetings. The failure to provide documents when asked \u2013 and the run-around required to obtain them \u2013 was significant enough that the Senate committee chair, Tim Storer, wrote to the secretary at the Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities asking them to address the lack of disclosure. \u201cGiven that the committee\u2019s consensus was that [electric vehicle] policy has suffered from the \u2018relative absence of overarching policy direction\u2019, it is disappointing that we know so little about the efforts of the ministerial forum charged with working on this very subject,\u201d Senator Storer said. \u201cTo give just one example, the department of the environment issued a draft regulation impact statement in 2016 which stated, among other things, that the health costs of business as usual to Australian cities of motor vehicle air pollution to $3.9bn a year in 2020.\u201d \u201cWhy that alone was not enough to compel the ministerial forum to take action is still unclear.\u201d Senator Patrick said the confusion and lack of proper record keeping showed a failure of good governance and demonstrated that the federal coalition was asleep at the wheel on electric cars. \u201cThey\u2019ve done nothing.

      "bodyText": "The Queensland state government has emerged as the latest thorn in the side of what is left of the government\u2019s \u201cbig stick\u201d energy legislation, warning it could lead to the unpopular privatisation of state-owned assets. Queensland\u2019s energy minister, Anthony Lynham, has called on the federal government to bring its much vaunted energy market misconduct bill to the next state energy ministers meeting for discussion. The objections come as the federal energy minister, Angus Taylor, will on Friday confirm that the Morrison government has received more than 60 submissions for its program underwriting new power generation assets. Taylor says the proposals for new power generation include coal, gas and hydro. The government has not released the submissions, but some of the applicants have outed themselves. One proposal is a $6bn plan by power baron Trevor St Baker for two new coal power plants. The underwriting program, as well as the \u201cbig stick\u201d legislation, has been blasted by a number of stakeholders. There has been criticism about the short timeframe for the program, and the Australian Industry Group has warned it could leave taxpayers exposed to liabilities \u201cwith a net present value of billions of dollars\u201d because the government could indemnify projects against the costs of new climate change policies. In his submission to the parliament committee reviewing the \u201cbig stick\u201d legislation, Lynham echoes concerns from power market players that the bill risks investment uncertainty, as well as providing at least three pathways to force the sale of Queensland-owned assets to the private sector. The privatisation of electricity assets, pushed through an asset recycling fund introduced by the Abbott government, has come under fire in recent years. The sell-offs have left governments with little recourse to tackle high prices. Queensland voters are particularly averse to privatisation, voting out both major parties in the wake of privatisation programs. While acknowledging the bill includes an exemption to allow government corporations to \u201cdispose of assets to a related or associated government authority in certain circumstances\u201d, Lynham said the legislation contains enough uncertainties to pose a \u201csignificant risk\u201d state assets could be sold. \u201cThe exception for state authorities in the legislation appears to apply to Queensland [government-owned corporations] but it is unclear, based on the definition of a state authority in the competition and consumer act, whether this exception would apply to a subsidiary of these organisations, such as Ergon Energy and Energex,\u201d Lynham wrote, naming the retail arms of Queensland\u2019s power companies. \u201cDue to the uncertainty around this term and how it would apply in the Queensland context, there is a risk that a divestiture order which targets public assets owned by a subsidiary of a Queensland Goc, could be required to privatise these assets.\u201d Lynham said the legislation could potentially allow for privatisation of state-owned assets if the state authority was not considered \u201cgenuinely in competition\u201d, and noted there was nothing stopping a state government from selling an asset to the private sector, as was once the policy of the state LNP. When introducing the legislation late last year, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, sought to allay concerns the bill could lead to the privatisation of state assets, in a bid to ensure the support of the key crossbencher Bob Katter. \u201cIf there is a divestment as last resort of a government asset, then it will be as another government entity,\u201d Frydenberg said in December. Katter, not entirely convinced, introduced his own amendments to the bill, which would specifically prevent privatisation. The Queensland submission, which comes on the back of energy and business market players who are critical of the legislation, is the latest hurdle for the government to overcome, after promising to tackle energy prices during Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s reign as prime minister. Upon taking over the party leadership, Scott Morrison appointed Angus Taylor the \u2018minister for lowering electricity prices\u2019 and promised a \u201cbig stick\u201d approach to combating perceived misconduct by power companies, which would have allowed the minister of the day to forcibly break up energy companies. Following partyroom discomfort with the measure, the final product was watered down to where divesture could only occur at the direction of the federal court, as a last resort, if previous warnings, including injunctions from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, were ignored. The government\u2019s attempts to have the legislation passed in the final sitting week of 2018 were derailed by Labor, with the opposition successfully hijacking the debate through procedural motions, which saw it put off until February at the earliest.",

Ben\u00edtez listed Almir\u00f3n as his top target this winter, and he was prepared to walk away if a deal wasn\u2019t made. Should the signing fail to improve Newcastle and they end up in the Championship, Ben\u00edtez could be out the door on someone else\u2019s terms.",

The fast-talking comic dynamo cropped up in Ocean\u2019s 8 and Crazy Rich Asians yet was sorely underused in both, showing us just enough to make us want much, much more, outperforming more seasoned co-stars with ease. Given her rising star (last year, she was also the first Asian woman to host <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/07/saturday-night-live-recap-brett-kavanaugh-senate-confirmation\">Saturday Night Live</a> since 2000) one would expect the next project to be a flashy star vehicle, an Apatow comedy, perhaps, something broad and multiplex-friendly.</p> <p>But neatly sidestepping convention, Awkwafina has found surprise Sundance success with The Farewell, an unexpected dramatic leap, the kind of which comic actors usually make much later in their career.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/30/animals-review-holliday-grainger-alia-shawkat-sundance\">Animals review \u2013 untamed female friendship drama is a Sundance triumph</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a statement of intent, informing the industry right from the outset that she doesn\u2019t want to be pigeonholed and an ambitious one at that, heading up a film mostly in Mandarin. She plays Billi, a woman living in New York who moved to the US with her parents as a child, leaving her extended family in China. She\u2019s maintained a close relationship with her grandmother Nai Nai (Shuzhen Zhou), speaking on the phone regularly, and is horrified to hear from her parents that she\u2019s been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. She\u2019s even more horrified when she hears that her family aren\u2019t planning to tell Nai Nai that she\u2019s dying. Instead, a wedding has been planned as a cover for them to say their goodbyes, and Billi must travel to China to take part in the ruse.</p> <p>The stage is set for all-out farce and while writer-director Lulu Wang does pepper her second feature with some light comedy, she avoids broader territory, instead choosing to construct a believably thorny family dynamic. The film is based on a true story, one that has previously been the subject of a This American Life episode, and there\u2019s authenticity underpinning the outlandish setup as well as cultural specificity. Billi\u2019s family explains that it\u2019s not an uncommon practice to mislead a dying family member in China and throughout her visit, she is forced to reckon with her feelings of detachment, a stranger in a country where she was born. Again, there\u2019s an avoidance of obvious culture clash comedy, and instead Wang deftly details both the guilt of living so far from family and how one\u2019s concept of what home really means can get so tangled.</p> <p>There\u2019s also resonance in Wang\u2019s examination of how different family members deal with extreme sadness. So often on screen there\u2019s a narrow uniformity when grief, or in this case a sort of pre-grief, is handled that it\u2019s refreshing to see a film that recognises the spectrum. There\u2019s a melancholy hovering in the background and Awkwafina does fine work expressing this through her eyes, so close to tears yet unable to release for fear of revealing the secret. She gives an accomplished dramatic performance and is surrounded by a skilled ensemble, naturalistic but distinctive. As her dying grandmother, Zhou is wonderful. She\u2019s loving but also spiky and insulting, a perceptive portrayal of an older family member whose filter has been lost along the way, such rich characterisation acting as a clear, unsoftened love letter to Wang\u2019s real-life grandmother.</p> <p>It\u2019s a slight film at times but one that builds to a crescendo of emotion that left many in my particular screening rather bleary-eyed (I\u2019d argue that the footnote, while eye-opening, sullies its power somewhat). Not long after its premiere, it was snapped up by A24 and it\u2019s clear that the film will be heading toward a wide audience, along with its star, for whom The Farewell acts as one hell of an introduction.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Farewell is showing at the Sundance film festival</p></li> </ul>",

Given her rising star (last year, she was also the first Asian woman to host Saturday Night Live since 2000) one would expect the next project to be a flashy star vehicle, an Apatow comedy, perhaps, something broad and multiplex-friendly. But neatly sidestepping convention, Awkwafina has found surprise Sundance success with The Farewell, an unexpected dramatic leap, the kind of which comic actors usually make much later in their career. It\u2019s a statement of intent, informing the industry right from the outset that she doesn\u2019t want to be pigeonholed and an ambitious one at that, heading up a film mostly in Mandarin. She plays Billi, a woman living in New York who moved to the US with her parents as a child, leaving her extended family in China. She\u2019s maintained a close relationship with her grandmother Nai Nai (Shuzhen Zhou), speaking on the phone regularly, and is horrified to hear from her parents that she\u2019s been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. She\u2019s even more horrified when she hears that her family aren\u2019t planning to tell Nai Nai that she\u2019s dying. Instead, a wedding has been planned as a cover for them to say their goodbyes, and Billi must travel to China to take part in the ruse. The stage is set for all-out farce and while writer-director Lulu Wang does pepper her second feature with some light comedy, she avoids broader territory, instead choosing to construct a believably thorny family dynamic. The film is based on a true story, one that has previously been the subject of a This American Life episode, and there\u2019s authenticity underpinning the outlandish setup as well as cultural specificity. Billi\u2019s family explains that it\u2019s not an uncommon practice to mislead a dying family member in China and throughout her visit, she is forced to reckon with her feelings of detachment, a stranger in a country where she was born. Again, there\u2019s an avoidance of obvious culture clash comedy, and instead Wang deftly details both the guilt of living so far from family and how one\u2019s concept of what home really means can get so tangled. There\u2019s also resonance in Wang\u2019s examination of how different family members deal with extreme sadness. So often on screen there\u2019s a narrow uniformity when grief, or in this case a sort of pre-grief, is handled that it\u2019s refreshing to see a film that recognises the spectrum. There\u2019s a melancholy hovering in the background and Awkwafina does fine work expressing this through her eyes, so close to tears yet unable to release for fear of revealing the secret. She gives an accomplished dramatic performance and is surrounded by a skilled ensemble, naturalistic but distinctive. As her dying grandmother, Zhou is wonderful. She\u2019s loving but also spiky and insulting, a perceptive portrayal of an older family member whose filter has been lost along the way, such rich characterisation acting as a clear, unsoftened love letter to Wang\u2019s real-life grandmother. It\u2019s a slight film at times but one that builds to a crescendo of emotion that left many in my particular screening rather bleary-eyed (I\u2019d argue that the footnote, while eye-opening, sullies its power somewhat). Not long after its premiere, it was snapped up by A24 and it\u2019s clear that the film will be heading toward a wide audience, along with its star, for whom The Farewell acts as one hell of an introduction. The Farewell is showing at the Sundance film festival",

Senior figures in Brussels have been war-gaming the likely next steps by the British government, and believe a delay to the UK\u2019s exit date of 29 March is inevitable. But they fear the prime minister\u2019s strategy of seeking simply to survive from day to day will lead to her requesting an inadequate short three-month extension for fear of enraging Brexiters in the Conservative party. EU officials and diplomats said the danger of the UK then crashing out in the summer was an underappreciated risk given that the escalation of no-deal planning and the cries of betrayal by Brexiters would give momentum to a cliff-edge Brexit. On Thursday the British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, became the first cabinet minister to admit that the two years of negotiations allowed under article 50 may have to be prolonged, describing the Brexit impasse as \u201ca very challenging situation\u201d. EU sources suggested it was unlikely that the heads of state and government of the 27 member states would reject such a request given the pressure that would be applied from the business community. On Thursday, Portugal\u2019s foreign minister, Augusto Santos Silva, said he believed a delay would be the wisest course given May\u2019s hopes of a renegotiation. \u201cWe have negotiated an agreement and the British parliament now says: we do not like this backstop clause, we have a better one,\u201d Silva said. \u201cWhat we are saying is: show us a better one.

Alan Jope, Unilever\u2019s chief executive, said the company had taken the decision to import extra supplies of the ice-cream, which is produced in mainland Europe, in case the ports grind to a halt. Jope also gave the example of its deodorant brands, which are made in Leeds and include Sure, Lynx and Dove, for which extra stock is being held on the other side of the Channel. The consumer goods giant owns more than 400 brands, including Persil, Cif and Cornetto, and other products are likely to be affected by the emergency measures, depending on where they are made. Brands produced in the UK include Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice-cream and Marmite but Magnums, for example, are made in factories in Italy and Germany. \u201cWe have built inventory on either side of the Channel,\u201d Jope said. \u201cIt\u2019s weeks of inventory \u2013 not months or days. \u201cIf I was in the designer handbag business then I might have built further [inventory] cover but we\u2019re not, we are in fast-moving consumer goods and one of the things we have learned is, when you build inventory, it can end up being the wrong mix of product.\u201d Jope said the overall cost involved in storing the additional stock, along with changing the artwork on products to ensure they still complied with relevant regulations, was not material to the company, which has annual sales of \u20ac51bn (\u00a344.6bn).

      "body": "<p>It was in Cardiff that I finally cracked the Da Vinci Code. For years I\u2019ve been searching for the clues that would explain this weird and wonderful genius. I\u2019ve visited the Tuscan hill town Vinci, where an illegitimate boy called Leonardo was born in 1452, and Amboise in the Loire Valley, where he died on 2 May 1519, looking for traces of his secret self. Yet it was on an icy afternoon in the Welsh capital that I finally found the killer clue to a real Leonardo da Vinci mystery: his sex life.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jan/28/leonardos-thumbprint-stars-in-anniversary-display-of-drawings\">Leonardo\u2019s inky fingerprint has been found</a> \u2013 it\u2019s just barely visible with the naked eye \u2013 on his drawing The Cardiovascular System and Principal Organs of a Woman, done c.1509-10, yet this is not the revelation. This big, bold graphic dissection of a female body is a window on Leonardo\u2019s emotions. He has drawn a female nude then transposed against her rounded breasts a complex machinery of tubes and pumps, bags and balloons. Her uterus looks like an alien creature. As an image of the female form it isn\u2019t exactly intimate, let alone lustful. At the <a href=\"https://museum.wales/\">National Museum Wales</a>, you can look straight from this to a far more sensual portrayal of the human body that he drew in about 1504: a scintillating study of a naked man from behind. Leonardo\u2019s muscular model stands at attention, showing us his curly locks and rippling back. His hands seem to visibly shake with contained energy. His stance is potent. Leonardo uses red chalk to give this nude a carnal warmth: its softness lets him delicately model every bulge and recess of taut skin. The man\u2019s buttocks are ripe ovals of perfection.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"59187d8715d2c4e72141268039325ffadf9c8efb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59187d8715d2c4e72141268039325ffadf9c8efb/0_0_3938_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cardiovascular system and principal organs of a woman; and Study of a male nude from behind, by Leonardo da Vinci.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"762\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cardiovascular system and principal organs of a woman; and Study of a male nude from behind, by Leonardo da Vinci.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Royal Collection Trust/Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These drawings shown together truly seem to decode something about the Renaissance artist, scientist, engineer and inventor who died 500 years ago this year.

Perhaps, if you could somehow see all the shows, you would know everything there is to know about Leonardo. He would come to life and talk.</p> <p>And there is so much to explain. Looking from Leonardo\u2019s loving, lingering male nude to his vision of what is clearly, for him, the alien entity of womanhood, it\u2019s hard not to share Sigmund Freud\u2019s analysis in his book on him that this Renaissance man loved other men. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Was Leonardo gay \u2013 and is that the key to his inner life?

Was Leonardo gay \u2013 and is that the key to his inner life?</p> <p>And yet, before you can humanise Leonardo you have to acknowledge the superhuman in him.

Every drawing in this exhibition is more than five centuries old. And these medieval masterpieces are incredibly well preserved. Each nuance of chalk, ink and colour wash seems to have been frozen forever. This is one reason why, I believe, you can get much closer to Leonardo in his drawings than in his paintings. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/oct/14/leonardo-da-vinci-mystery-why-is-his-450m-masterpiece-really-being-kept-under-wraps-salvator-mundi\">His paintings have been restored</a> and repainted over the centuries, or fallen to bits, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/19/leonardo-last-supper-ross-king-review\">The Last Supper</a>.

Yet there are other landscapes by him that also seem to be seen from the sky. Famously, he tried to make a flying machine. This drawing shows flight is central to his way of thinking about the world: he literally wanted to rise above it all.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Near the end of his life, he became obsessed with deluges tearing the world apart, smashing a mountain, destroying an army like ants</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Leonardo was not at ease in human society. Why would he be? In one drawing in the Cardiff exhibition he portrays a thuggish face, a huge, fleshy head on a thick neck. In another work, in Bristol, he delineates a savage battle. They are both instances of his bleak feelings about the brutality and violence of our species. Other masterpieces show how, near the end of his life, he became obsessed with deluges tearing the world apart, smashing a mountain, destroying an army like ants under the swirling power of the elements.</p> <p>His curiosity is so insistent, like that of a staring child. Or maybe a serial killer, meticulously drawing the bones of the dead. No one had ever before looked at human anatomy as Leonardo does in drawings based on his own dissections.

The film is largely set in Memphis at the real-life <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Restoration_Path\" title=\"\">Love in Action</a>, an \u201cex-gay\u201d Christian ministry, run on screen by Edgerton as chief therapist Victor Sykes (a portrayal of the ministry\u2019s former director, <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/John_Smid\" title=\"\">John Smid</a>).</p> <p>This is not Edgerton\u2019s first film behind and in front of camera (four years ago, he made a psychological thriller called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/09/the-gift-film-review-joel-edgerton-jason-bateman-rebecca-hall\" title=\"\">The Gift</a>).

According to Edgerton, the organisation had only \u201cone or two\u201d concerns. One character removed from an early draft was a girl enrolled in the Love in Action programme after her parents caught her having an \u201cindiscretion\u201d with the family pet. \u201cSometimes truth is stranger than fiction,\u201d says Edgerton. \u201cI don\u2019t want any chance for people to watch this movie and think we\u2019re painting anyone of the LGBTQ community as deviant.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, he swung the other way, writing in Troye Sivan\u2019s character, Gary: a composed, seemingly well-adjusted young gay man, savvy enough to tell the conversion therapists what they want to hear. \u201cLove in Action was trying to make people into deviants,\u201d adds Edgerton, \u201cit was not our job as film-makers to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Another omission was that of a teacher who had assaulted his students. The character was originally included to highlight the institution\u2019s practice of putting sexual abusers in the same group as young people (\u201cI found that a fascinating indictment of the lack of care in the place\u201d), but, on reflection, Edgerton felt time constraints inhibited an adequate exploration of the character.</p> <p>Although you wonder how a gay director would have tackled the same issues, the fact that Edgerton is in some ways sanitising Conley\u2019s memoir \u2013 rather than sensationalising it \u2013 perhaps demonstrates the increasing sensitivities straight directors have about how they tell queer stories. But by Edgerton\u2019s own admission, his eagerness to avoid feeding into gay tropes or causing offence limited his writing.</p> <p>\u201cI also wish I could have been a smart enough writer to amplify a quality in Garrard that he described in the book: that, even at Love in Action, his way of coping, like many of us, was through humour, and he was a bit of a class clown,\u201d he says. \u201cMy fear was that if I had Lucas cracking jokes and doing other stuff, it would give the wrong steer and diminish the tension. But I wonder if a better writer than me would have been able to include that as a builder of tension, rather than a diminisher.\u201d</p> <p>Edgerton\u2019s preparation for the film took him to Texas, where he met Smid, the man he would be portraying. Smid joined the Love in Action leadership in 1986 and eventually became its director. He left in 2008 and <a href=\"http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/national-news/new-south-wales-news/ex-gay-leader-apologises/23288\" title=\"\">publicly apologised</a> three years later for the wounds the programme inflicted on vulnerable young people. At the end of the film \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 it is revealed that Smid married another man in 2014.</p> <p>Edgerton says Smid was \u201cbrave enough\u201d to come to the film\u2019s premiere in New York, and had originally offered himself up as a consultant during its production. Smid is not entirely sold on the telling of events according to Edgerton (although he has <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/commentary/2019/1/16/former-ex-gay-leader-these-programs-are-harmful-and-dont-work\" title=\"\">written in the Advocate</a> that the film was \u201clargely an accurate depiction of such programmes\u201d).</p> <p>\u201cLooking back, Smid thinks things weren\u2019t as bad and there wasn\u2019t any shouting and all that,\u201d says Edgerton. \u201cBut then it\u2019s a case of \u2018he said, she said\u2019, I think.

      "bodyText": "Are straight directors qualified to tell gay stories on screen? The Australian actor-director Joel Edgerton didn\u2019t think he was. At least, not when first reading Boy Erased: A Memoir, Garrard Conley\u2019s account of his childhood experiences in gay conversion therapy. He knew it would make a compelling film, but he didn\u2019t believe he was best placed to do it. \u201cI was like: fuck, this would be a great movie and I would love to be the one to do it. But I don\u2019t think I can, simply because I\u2019m not of the LGBTQ community,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d really started to think in the last couple of years a lot about representation \u2013 mainly in front of the screen.\u201d He optioned the book anyway, unable to shake it from his mind. He sought out Conley, spoke to survivors of conversion therapy, researched the infrastructure surrounding it, met with Conley\u2019s abuser and then began a screenplay. Directing it became a less distant possibility. \u201cIt was like, I feel so passionate about it and I can\u2019t get this out of my head.\u201d The resulting film follows Conley \u2013 Jared, played by Lucas Hedges \u2013 as he comes out to his mother (Nicole Kidman) and father (Russell Crowe), a Baptist preacher who convinces his son to enroll on a 12-day conversion therapy course. The film is largely set in Memphis at the real-life Love in Action, an \u201cex-gay\u201d Christian ministry, run on screen by Edgerton as chief therapist Victor Sykes (a portrayal of the ministry\u2019s former director, John Smid). This is not Edgerton\u2019s first film behind and in front of camera (four years ago, he made a psychological thriller called The Gift). Boy Erased was Oscar-tipped at the time of the first trailer, but has been largely overlooked since, despite positive reviews. But it is not the critics \u2013 or Oscar voters \u2013 Edgerton is worried about. \u201cObviously, I crave acceptance of that [LGBTQ] community,\u201d he says. \u201cTo know that, with respect, I\u2019m an ally who felt passionate enough to make it but I didn\u2019t fuck anything up.\u201d To that end, he showed Conley every draft of the script and cut of the movie, and one of the first versions was sent to Glaad, the US organisation that monitors media coverage of LGBTQ issues. According to Edgerton, the organisation had only \u201cone or two\u201d concerns. One character removed from an early draft was a girl enrolled in the Love in Action programme after her parents caught her having an \u201cindiscretion\u201d with the family pet. \u201cSometimes truth is stranger than fiction,\u201d says Edgerton. \u201cI don\u2019t want any chance for people to watch this movie and think we\u2019re painting anyone of the LGBTQ community as deviant.\u201d Instead, he swung the other way, writing in Troye Sivan\u2019s character, Gary: a composed, seemingly well-adjusted young gay man, savvy enough to tell the conversion therapists what they want to hear. \u201cLove in Action was trying to make people into deviants,\u201d adds Edgerton, \u201cit was not our job as film-makers to do that.\u201d Another omission was that of a teacher who had assaulted his students. The character was originally included to highlight the institution\u2019s practice of putting sexual abusers in the same group as young people (\u201cI found that a fascinating indictment of the lack of care in the place\u201d), but, on reflection, Edgerton felt time constraints inhibited an adequate exploration of the character. Although you wonder how a gay director would have tackled the same issues, the fact that Edgerton is in some ways sanitising Conley\u2019s memoir \u2013 rather than sensationalising it \u2013 perhaps demonstrates the increasing sensitivities straight directors have about how they tell queer stories. But by Edgerton\u2019s own admission, his eagerness to avoid feeding into gay tropes or causing offence limited his writing. \u201cI also wish I could have been a smart enough writer to amplify a quality in Garrard that he described in the book: that, even at Love in Action, his way of coping, like many of us, was through humour, and he was a bit of a class clown,\u201d he says. \u201cMy fear was that if I had Lucas cracking jokes and doing other stuff, it would give the wrong steer and diminish the tension.

He left in 2008 and publicly apologised three years later for the wounds the programme inflicted on vulnerable young people. At the end of the film \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 it is revealed that Smid married another man in 2014. Edgerton says Smid was \u201cbrave enough\u201d to come to the film\u2019s premiere in New York, and had originally offered himself up as a consultant during its production. Smid is not entirely sold on the telling of events according to Edgerton (although he has written in the Advocate that the film was \u201clargely an accurate depiction of such programmes\u201d). \u201cLooking back, Smid thinks things weren\u2019t as bad and there wasn\u2019t any shouting and all that,\u201d says Edgerton. \u201cBut then it\u2019s a case of \u2018he said, she said\u2019, I think.

Some were frustrated that the only sexual act between two men in the film involved violence; others felt that the trauma of sexual abuse was ignored and the film lacked an adequate trigger warning (Edgerton says there is one in Australia). \u201cMost criticism of the film, I find fair,\u201d he says. \u201cI can appreciate that some people are like, \u2018Well, where\u2019s the love and tenderness?\u2019 \u2026 but the first sexual experience you see in the film is one of violence.

Boy Erased scores points among many, however, for casting in its lead role an actor open about his own sexual fluidity. This at a time when the debate over whether straight actors should portray gay characters rages anew, following Darren Criss\u2019s announcement that he would no longer take on gay roles, and awards acclaim for Rami Malek and Olivia Colman playing LGBTQ characters. Edgerton is clearly aware of the sensitivities around the debate. And he recognises that, as a straight man, he will be under particular scrutiny. But he dances around the topic, referencing the backlash against Scarlett Johansson after it was announced she\u2019d been cast as Dante \u201cTex\u201d Gill, a trans man, and he refuses to commit to either side of the debate. \u201cMaybe that movie will never get that made,\u201d he says. \u201cIs it better that the movie is made?

And they don\u2019t have any trouble getting employment, as far as I can tell.\u201d He hopes that Sivan\u2019s performance in Boy Erased, as well as his various successes elsewhere, could help to inspire other actors to come out. \u201cTroye has shown by example that, by being out and proud, there\u2019s actually maybe an even bigger audience for you than the assumption that you would diminish your audience,\u201d says Edgerton, who claims to \u201cabsolutely\u201d know actors who aren\u2019t out. \u201cClearly, I wouldn\u2019t out anybody. But just the idea that that is your world \u2013 it\u2019s almost like you\u2019d rather take away your fame and just lead a normal life. I just can\u2019t imagine what that would feel like. It shouldn\u2019t exist in the acting community.\u201d Edgerton\u2019s hopes for his own finished film are similarly virtuous: being used as an \u201cicebreaker\u201d between young LGBTQ people and their parents, or as a guide for those considering enrolling their children in conversion therapy. He is certainly keen for it to be wider educational piece: before the end credits, viewers are told that 700,000 LGBTQ Americans have undergone conversion therapy programmes, while only 14 US states have deemed it illegal. Ultimately, his ambition seems to be for the film\u2019s cultural relevance to diminish. \u201cIt would be nice if, as soon as possible, the film was really a museum piece so that people can watch it and go: \u2018Oh shit, they used to do that kind of thing.\u2019 Of course, it\u2019s very naive to say that the persecution of LGBTQ people could ever just go away because conversion therapy is one thing,\u201d he says, before invoking \u2013 ambitiously, but perhaps not unfairly \u2013 One Flew Over The Cuckoo\u2019s Nest. \u201cThe hope is that there was no point even making the film.\u201d \u2022 Boy Erased is released on 8 February in the UK.",

His readiness to resign from the leadership of one the two most powerful international financial institutions is a worrying omen. But it is also an important wake-up call.</p> <p>The World Bank and the IMF are the last remaining columns of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system\">Bretton Woods edifice</a> under which capitalism experienced its golden age in the 1950s and 1960s. While that system, and the fixed exchange rate regime it relied upon, bit the dust in 1971, the two institutions continued to support global finance along purely Atlanticist lines: with Europe\u2019s establishment choosing the IMF\u2019s managing director and the United States selecting the head of the World Bank.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/12/ivanka-trump-world-bank-donald-trump-report\">'Ridiculous': report Ivanka Trump could lead World Bank meets scorn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kim, a career physician who presented himself as a <a href=\"http://president.worldbankgroup.org/home\">champion of poverty alleviation</a>, now leaves the fate of the bank\u2019s leadership in the hands of Donald Trump \u2013 the global equivalent of a progressive supreme court justice hanging up his robes in the middle of a Republican White House. Adding a touch of the absurd to the drama, it is the US president\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, who is now <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/ivanka-trump-world-bank-president.html\">leading the search</a> committee for Kim\u2019s replacement.</p> <p>But like every crisis of the Trump era, this sordid affair is an excellent opportunity to mobilize around an entirely new vision for the Bretton Woods institutions \u2013 to push for radical reforms that would put the resources of the World Bank and the IMF in the service of the many, rather than lubricating the wheels of global finance in the interest of the very few.</p> <p>Such a progressive vision would bring the Bretton Woods system much closer to the lofty intentions of its framers. \u201cProsperity, like peace, is indivisible,\u201d said the US treasury secretary, Henry Morgenthau, in his <a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/people/henry_morgenthau_jr\">inaugural speech</a> to the Bretton Woods conference, which gave birth to the World Bank (then the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) and to the IMF. \u201cWe cannot afford to have it scattered here or there among the fortunate or enjoy it at the expense of others.\u201d</p> <p>The original Bretton Woods plan was for exchange rates to be fixed, with the IMF helping heavily indebted countries restructure their debt and a stabilization fund curbing capital flight. Meanwhile, the World Bank would offer development finance and an international commodity stabilization corporation would \u201cbring about the orderly marketing of staple commodities at prices fair to the producer and consumer alike\u201d. Finally, the whole system would be dollar-denominated, with the greenback being the only currency exchangeable for gold at a fixed rate.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If we do not act quickly \u2013 demanding a radical change of direction \u2013 the World Bank will likely fade into irrelevance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>John Maynard Keynes, the chief British negotiator at Bretton Woods, was worried that the new system could only rely on the dollar as long as America had a trade surplus. The moment the United States became a deficit country, the system would collapse. So, Keynes suggested that instead of building the new world order on the dollar, all major economies would subscribe to a multilateral International Clearing Union (ICU). While keeping their own currencies, and central banks, countries would agree to denominate all international payments in a common accounting unit, which Keynes named the bancor, and to clear all international payments through the ICU.</p> <p>Once set up, the ICU would tax persistent surpluses and deficits symmetrically so as to balance out capital flows, volatility, global aggregate demand and productivity. Had it been instituted, the ICU would have worked alongside the World Bank to keep the global economy in balance and build shared prosperity worldwide.</p> <p>But Keynes\u2019s ICU was rejected. The United States was unwilling to replace the dollar as the anchor of the new monetary system.

      "bodyText": "The president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, will step down on 1 February \u2013 three and a half years before the end of his term \u2013 in search of greener pastures. His readiness to resign from the leadership of one the two most powerful international financial institutions is a worrying omen. But it is also an important wake-up call. The World Bank and the IMF are the last remaining columns of the Bretton Woods edifice under which capitalism experienced its golden age in the 1950s and 1960s. While that system, and the fixed exchange rate regime it relied upon, bit the dust in 1971, the two institutions continued to support global finance along purely Atlanticist lines: with Europe\u2019s establishment choosing the IMF\u2019s managing director and the United States selecting the head of the World Bank. Kim, a career physician who presented himself as a champion of poverty alleviation, now leaves the fate of the bank\u2019s leadership in the hands of Donald Trump \u2013 the global equivalent of a progressive supreme court justice hanging up his robes in the middle of a Republican White House. Adding a touch of the absurd to the drama, it is the US president\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, who is now leading the search committee for Kim\u2019s replacement. But like every crisis of the Trump era, this sordid affair is an excellent opportunity to mobilize around an entirely new vision for the Bretton Woods institutions \u2013 to push for radical reforms that would put the resources of the World Bank and the IMF in the service of the many, rather than lubricating the wheels of global finance in the interest of the very few. Such a progressive vision would bring the Bretton Woods system much closer to the lofty intentions of its framers. \u201cProsperity, like peace, is indivisible,\u201d said the US treasury secretary, Henry Morgenthau, in his inaugural speech to the Bretton Woods conference, which gave birth to the World Bank (then the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) and to the IMF. \u201cWe cannot afford to have it scattered here or there among the fortunate or enjoy it at the expense of others.\u201d The original Bretton Woods plan was for exchange rates to be fixed, with the IMF helping heavily indebted countries restructure their debt and a stabilization fund curbing capital flight. Meanwhile, the World Bank would offer development finance and an international commodity stabilization corporation would \u201cbring about the orderly marketing of staple commodities at prices fair to the producer and consumer alike\u201d. Finally, the whole system would be dollar-denominated, with the greenback being the only currency exchangeable for gold at a fixed rate. John Maynard Keynes, the chief British negotiator at Bretton Woods, was worried that the new system could only rely on the dollar as long as America had a trade surplus. The moment the United States became a deficit country, the system would collapse. So, Keynes suggested that instead of building the new world order on the dollar, all major economies would subscribe to a multilateral International Clearing Union (ICU). While keeping their own currencies, and central banks, countries would agree to denominate all international payments in a common accounting unit, which Keynes named the bancor, and to clear all international payments through the ICU. Once set up, the ICU would tax persistent surpluses and deficits symmetrically so as to balance out capital flows, volatility, global aggregate demand and productivity. Had it been instituted, the ICU would have worked alongside the World Bank to keep the global economy in balance and build shared prosperity worldwide. But Keynes\u2019s ICU was rejected. The United States was unwilling to replace the dollar as the anchor of the new monetary system. And so the IMF was downgraded to a bailout fund, the World Bank was limited to lending from its own reserves (contributed by stressed member states) and, crucially, any possibility of the IMF leveraging the World Bank\u2019s investments (like a central bank might have done) was jettisoned. Following large US trade deficits, then president Richard Nixon announced on 15 August 1971 the effective end of the Bretton Woods system \u2013 just as Keynes had predicted. Immediately, the private banks, which the Bretton Woods system had been keeping under a lid, sprang up and the world was taken over by financialization. Rather than supporting governments and prosperity, the World Bank and the IMF led the so-called Washington consensus: an orchestrated campaign of mass privatization, austerity and financial deregulation. \u201cThere are virtually no limits on what can be privatized,\u201d wrote Mary Shirley, the chief of the public sector management and private sector development division, in 1992. Jim Yong Kim was once a fierce critic of the Washington consensus. In his book Dying for Growth, published in 2000, Kim railed against the World Bank\u2019s free marketeering, the costs of which \u201chave been borne by the poor, the infirm and the vulnerable in poor countries that accepted the experts\u2019 designs\u201d. Yet as president, Kim turbocharged the bank\u2019s commitment to private profits against the public interest. \u201cMaximizing finance for development\u201d (MFD), the strategy he adopted in 2015, transformed the World Bank from a direct investor in developing countries to a mere facilitator of private finance. The bank\u2019s core activity would not be lending to governments, but to \u201cde-risk projects, sectors and entire countries\u201d, in effect socializing the risks on behalf of the private investors and privatizing any gains. From this perspective, it makes perfect sense that Mr Kim resigned early to take up a post at \u2026 a private equity firm. His decision must, however, be our cue to review the role of the World Bank and the IMF today, and perhaps to revisit Keynes\u2019s prescient idea circa 1944. The world today needs, as much as it did in 1944, a massive international investment program. Back then, humanity needed reconstruction after a lethal world war. Today, the planet is crying out for a green transition that will cost at least $8tn annually. Where will the money come from? Surely not from the stressed budgets of our states. Here\u2019s an idea: build a new Bretton Woods and fund the International Green New Deal by simply mobilizing idle savings via a linkup between the revamped World Bank and the new IMF. The IMF can become the issuer of a digital currency unit in which all international payments are denominated, countries can retain their currencies (that will float freely against the IMF\u2019s unit), and a wealth fund can be built by depositing in it currency units in proportion to every country\u2019s trade deficits and surpluses. Meanwhile, backed by the IMF\u2019s capacity to issue the world currency unit, the World Bank can crowd idle savings from across the world into green investments, reclaiming its soul after decades of investing in environmental destruction and human displacement. Kim\u2019s departure makes one thing clear: the World Bank is on the brink. New development banks are growing in size and in scope, filling the space that the World Bank has long since abandoned. Now is the time to mobilize \u2013 to push a new crop of progressive leaders to start thinking internationally, taking their enthusiasm for the Green New Deal to the global level. If we do not act quickly \u2013 demanding a radical change of direction \u2013 the World Bank will likely fade into irrelevance. Or worse: it will become a plaything for the Trump family and its associates, making the world into their great golf course.

      "body": "<p>Driving to university for the first time, I felt prepared. I\u2019d packed a doorstop (to help my social life) and secondhand legal textbooks (books are timeless, laws don\u2019t change). I was ready to start a new part of my life. I met my flatmates, found my lecture hall and everything started to feel like home.</p> <p>Cut to the morning of my first exam and I could barely stand without fainting, weak from sleep deprivation and 10 hours of vomiting. I couldn\u2019t make it to the exam \u2013 or any exam that year \u2013 and began the complicated, tiring process of requesting support for my disabilities before I could restart my studies.</p> <p>Diagnosis for disabilities cost more money than I had. So at 18 I attempted to do university without one, which was a terrible idea. I had no clue what support was available to disabled students. Support ranges from one-to-one study tutors to modified laptops, and speech-to-text software to counsellors. The services may have been wide-ranging but were hard to find. I was told the proof of my disabilities \u2013 Irlen Syndrome and dyspraxia \u2013 was inadequate. It meant I couldn\u2019t receive a disabled student\u2019s allowance (DSA), the government allowance needed to pay for disability support and expenses.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/24/i-couldnt-have-gone-to-university-without-support-for-my-disability\">I couldn't have gone to university without support for my disability | Caroline Butterwick</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Felix Manocha-Seymour, chair of the University of Bristol\u2019s disability network, agrees that awareness of what support is available is a massive barrier. Manocha-Seymour didn\u2019t know the university library had an assistive technology room to help mitigate chronic shoulder pain until talking to a library staff member. This is not something not all disabled students are able to do; as Manocha-Seymour says, \u201cfor people who struggle with asking for help or communicating their needs, it could be very difficult to get the support they need\u201d.</p> <p>Even when I tracked down an affordable diagnosis service and got rediagnosed after my exams, accessing support was still difficult. The DSA application took months. When I finally received my entitlement summary it was overwhelming. Care for disabled students has been privatised and every service is run by a different company; getting a specially adapted laptop required three different providers for the hardware, adapted programmes and training, as well as again providing \u201cevidence\u201d of my disability.</p> <p>For some disabled students, DSA won\u2019t cover the total cost of their care. Disabled students are far <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/low-expectations-are-stopping-young-disabled-people-going-to-university-93033\">less likely to enter higher education</a> than their non-disabled peers, because studying is that much harder when their survival isn\u2019t prioritised.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/17/sometimes-you-feel-alone-studying-at-university-with-a-disability\">'Sometimes you feel alone': studying at university with a disability</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m now in my final year and it\u2019s still an uphill battle to get basic academic necessities. That modified laptop I received? It arrived broken and still hasn\u2019t been fixed by the provider. It took months before I was allocated a counsellor. There are still institution-wide problems that DSA doesn\u2019t account for, such as poorly scanned reading resources, or having tutorials in the evening when the sun has set, which make it difficult to do the work and engage in class. Several tutors have said I\u2019m the first student to ask for accessible materials on their unit. Even when all the correct procedures are followed, the relevant support is elusive.</p> <p>I\u2019m tired. The anxiety that comes with being disabled is intense. I often find myself lying to fellow students about why I\u2019m a year older so that they feel more comfortable, and try to brush over why my grades fluctuated between my first and second years in job applications. Sometimes I wonder why I\u2019m here when the system is set up to exclude students like me. Listening to disabled student\u2019s experiences and making support \u2013 and information about support \u2013 readily available is essential.</p> <ul> <li><p>Ellie Drewry is a law student at Bristol University and a former Change100 intern</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Driving to university for the first time, I felt prepared. I\u2019d packed a doorstop (to help my social life) and secondhand legal textbooks (books are timeless, laws don\u2019t change). I was ready to start a new part of my life. I met my flatmates, found my lecture hall and everything started to feel like home. Cut to the morning of my first exam and I could barely stand without fainting, weak from sleep deprivation and 10 hours of vomiting. I couldn\u2019t make it to the exam \u2013 or any exam that year \u2013 and began the complicated, tiring process of requesting support for my disabilities before I could restart my studies. Diagnosis for disabilities cost more money than I had. So at 18 I attempted to do university without one, which was a terrible idea. I had no clue what support was available to disabled students. Support ranges from one-to-one study tutors to modified laptops, and speech-to-text software to counsellors. The services may have been wide-ranging but were hard to find. I was told the proof of my disabilities \u2013 Irlen Syndrome and dyspraxia \u2013 was inadequate. It meant I couldn\u2019t receive a disabled student\u2019s allowance (DSA), the government allowance needed to pay for disability support and expenses. Felix Manocha-Seymour, chair of the University of Bristol\u2019s disability network, agrees that awareness of what support is available is a massive barrier. Manocha-Seymour didn\u2019t know the university library had an assistive technology room to help mitigate chronic shoulder pain until talking to a library staff member. This is not something not all disabled students are able to do; as Manocha-Seymour says, \u201cfor people who struggle with asking for help or communicating their needs, it could be very difficult to get the support they need\u201d. Even when I tracked down an affordable diagnosis service and got rediagnosed after my exams, accessing support was still difficult. The DSA application took months. When I finally received my entitlement summary it was overwhelming. Care for disabled students has been privatised and every service is run by a different company; getting a specially adapted laptop required three different providers for the hardware, adapted programmes and training, as well as again providing \u201cevidence\u201d of my disability. For some disabled students, DSA won\u2019t cover the total cost of their care. Disabled students are far less likely to enter higher education than their non-disabled peers, because studying is that much harder when their survival isn\u2019t prioritised. I\u2019m now in my final year and it\u2019s still an uphill battle to get basic academic necessities. That modified laptop I received? It arrived broken and still hasn\u2019t been fixed by the provider. It took months before I was allocated a counsellor. There are still institution-wide problems that DSA doesn\u2019t account for, such as poorly scanned reading resources, or having tutorials in the evening when the sun has set, which make it difficult to do the work and engage in class. Several tutors have said I\u2019m the first student to ask for accessible materials on their unit. Even when all the correct procedures are followed, the relevant support is elusive. I\u2019m tired. The anxiety that comes with being disabled is intense. I often find myself lying to fellow students about why I\u2019m a year older so that they feel more comfortable, and try to brush over why my grades fluctuated between my first and second years in job applications. Sometimes I wonder why I\u2019m here when the system is set up to exclude students like me. Listening to disabled student\u2019s experiences and making support \u2013 and information about support \u2013 readily available is essential.

Tehran has been pressing for progress on the payment channel for months, occasionally threatening to pull out of the deal unless the EU showed greater urgency on what is a highly technical banking and legal exercise.

She was the archetypal anonymous MP who\u2019d made a career out of saying little and doing less. But then she came to public attention when she unexpectedly made it to the last two of the Tory leadership election after David Cameron resigned.</p> <p>Leadsom had started her campaign in exemplary fashion by keeping her mouth firmly shut and letting Stephen Crabb, Liam Fox and Michael Gove disqualify themselves by opening theirs. Things started to go wrong only when she began to raise her profile.</p> <p>First she announced she was going to be making a speech on the economy. This proved to be comedy gold, as she managed to talk for all of 20 minutes and didn\u2019t get round to mentioning the economy once.

      "bodyText": "Three years ago almost no one had heard of Andrea Leadsom. Not even her South Northamptonshire constituents. She was the archetypal anonymous MP who\u2019d made a career out of saying little and doing less. But then she came to public attention when she unexpectedly made it to the last two of the Tory leadership election after David Cameron resigned. Leadsom had started her campaign in exemplary fashion by keeping her mouth firmly shut and letting Stephen Crabb, Liam Fox and Michael Gove disqualify themselves by opening theirs. Things started to go wrong only when she began to raise her profile. First she announced she was going to be making a speech on the economy. This proved to be comedy gold, as she managed to talk for all of 20 minutes and didn\u2019t get round to mentioning the economy once. Then she handed out pale blue #RALLY4LEADSOM T-shirts, which she\u2019d just collected from Prontaprint, to the few dozen supporters who had come to hear her die on her feet, and led an Idiots\u2019 Platoon march on Westminster.

Most other observers were probably just thinking \u201cThrottur FC\u201d, the more common name for the team who, in 2003, were top of the Icelandic league at halfway only to finish the campaign being relegated.</p> <p>Liverpool are unlikely to suffer that fate this season, of course, because by clinging on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/30/liverpool-leicester-premier-league-match-report\">for a draw</a> against Claude Puel\u2019s weird riddle of a side, J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s men stuttered 42 points clear of Cardiff City. Now the Welsh outfit, 18th in the Premier League, could only overhaul the Reds by winning all their remaining games and, in the process, producing a swing in goal difference to the tune of 67. Virgil van Dijk, for one, is confident that\u2019s not going to happen. The Dutchman says supporters at Anfield should just chill, relax, be mellow, act like Harry Maguire is standing free in front of their goal as a cross floats his way.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/31/liverpool-fans-want-title-but-be-patient-virgil-van-dijk\">Liverpool fans want title badly but must be patient, says Virgil van Dijk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked whether he detected nervousness from the home crowd during Liverpool\u2019s attempt to inspire Manchester City more than Pep Guardiola was able to do against Newcastle, Van Dijk stopped saying \u201commmmmmmmmmmmm\u201d long enough to reply: \u201cIt sounded like it.\u201d The Fiver suspects Alisson was also invited to express his views on the matter but took so long to get his words out that James Maddison nearly nicked them off him. Instead Van Dijk stepped in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/31/liverpool-fans-want-title-but-be-patient-virgil-van-dijk\">to rescue the interview</a> by holding forth a little more about the jittery Anfield atmosphere: \u201cObviously you get that feeling as well from the crowd and I think it\u2019s not really necessary. Everyone wants to win so bad and that\u2019s what we want as well. But sometimes you have to be patient.\u201d Liverpool fans have waited 29 years for another league title, so they can wait a little longer.

      "bodyText": "REDS MISSED Famously, Liverpool fans are among the world\u2019s most educated about football, which is why you could almost hear the Kop murmur \u201cKnattspyrnuf\u00e9lagi\u00f0 \u00der\u00f3ttur\u201d throughout Wednesday\u2019s trouser-soiling ordeal against Leicester City. Most other observers were probably just thinking \u201cThrottur FC\u201d, the more common name for the team who, in 2003, were top of the Icelandic league at halfway only to finish the campaign being relegated. Liverpool are unlikely to suffer that fate this season, of course, because by clinging on for a draw against Claude Puel\u2019s weird riddle of a side, J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s men stuttered 42 points clear of Cardiff City. Now the Welsh outfit, 18th in the Premier League, could only overhaul the Reds by winning all their remaining games and, in the process, producing a swing in goal difference to the tune of 67. Virgil van Dijk, for one, is confident that\u2019s not going to happen. The Dutchman says supporters at Anfield should just chill, relax, be mellow, act like Harry Maguire is standing free in front of their goal as a cross floats his way. Asked whether he detected nervousness from the home crowd during Liverpool\u2019s attempt to inspire Manchester City more than Pep Guardiola was able to do against Newcastle, Van Dijk stopped saying \u201commmmmmmmmmmmm\u201d long enough to reply: \u201cIt sounded like it.\u201d The Fiver suspects Alisson was also invited to express his views on the matter but took so long to get his words out that James Maddison nearly nicked them off him. Instead Van Dijk stepped in to rescue the interview by holding forth a little more about the jittery Anfield atmosphere: \u201cObviously you get that feeling as well from the crowd and I think it\u2019s not really necessary. Everyone wants to win so bad and that\u2019s what we want as well. But sometimes you have to be patient.\u201d Liverpool fans have waited 29 years for another league title, so they can wait a little longer. But they\u2019ll be hard pressed to enjoy it if Liverpool continue to wobble like Neil Ruddock on a water bed. At least their players and fans have until Monday\u2019s trip to West Ham to regain their composure, by which time City may have narrowed the gap at the top to two points, provided they don\u2019t bottle it against Arsenal, who, by winning at the Etihad, may yet help give Humble Spurs a massive ego enhancement. Who said this season\u2019s title race had become boring? Oh, sorry about that. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE It\u2019s only transfer deadline day live, with Niall McVeigh leading you through to the 11pm GMT deadline without any gaudy coloured garb in sight.

But order has been restored with a fresh storm about homophobic remarks aired during the new series of The Grand Tour, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/willyoung/status/1090008459070894081\" title=\"\">highlighted on Twitter</a> by the singer Will Young.</p> <p>\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d said Young. \u201cI\u2019m pissed and fed up. I want Amazon Prime and the producers of Grand Tour to meet young LGBT [people] who want to kill themselves because of shaming and laughter and normalising of shaming homophobic narratives.\u201d</p> <p>Young\u2019s complaint lies with an episode in which Clarkson and his underlings, Richard Hammond and James May, travel across Colombia under the pretext of photographing wildlife. Clarkson is given a Jeep Wrangler to drive, which May notes is \u201ca very popular car with the gay community\u201d. The trio then stand around pondering the meaning of LGBT \u2013 \u201cwhat is it \u2013 lesbian, bacon, transgender?\u201d asks Clarkson. Later on Hammond declares that the vehicle would be best paired with \u201csome nice chaps, suede, but ventilated at the back\u201d.

The Grand Tour, meanwhile, has spent the past two-and-a-bit years bulldozing its way across continents, proudly racking up air miles and hoisting its hosts aloft like minor royalty in a sedan chair. In the offending episode, we also get to see Hammond trying to manoeuvre a monster truck through the back streets of Cartagena, in the process holding up an ambulance trying to attend an emergency.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been a while since Jeremy Clarkson caused an upset. The days of him punching a producer, prompting his ejection from the BBC, or straining diplomatic relations in Argentina seem so long ago, it\u2019s enough to make one nostalgic. But order has been restored with a fresh storm about homophobic remarks aired during the new series of The Grand Tour, highlighted on Twitter by the singer Will Young. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d said Young. \u201cI\u2019m pissed and fed up. I want Amazon Prime and the producers of Grand Tour to meet young LGBT [people] who want to kill themselves because of shaming and laughter and normalising of shaming homophobic narratives.\u201d Young\u2019s complaint lies with an episode in which Clarkson and his underlings, Richard Hammond and James May, travel across Colombia under the pretext of photographing wildlife. Clarkson is given a Jeep Wrangler to drive, which May notes is \u201ca very popular car with the gay community\u201d. The trio then stand around pondering the meaning of LGBT \u2013 \u201cwhat is it \u2013 lesbian, bacon, transgender?\u201d asks Clarkson. Later on Hammond declares that the vehicle would be best paired with \u201csome nice chaps, suede, but ventilated at the back\u201d. Meanwhile, The Weather Girls\u2019 It\u2019s Raining Men plays on the stereo. Should we be surprised? Schoolboy sniggering and colonial-style bantz has long been the trio\u2019s stock-in-trade. The Grand Tour, meanwhile, has spent the past two-and-a-bit years bulldozing its way across continents, proudly racking up air miles and hoisting its hosts aloft like minor royalty in a sedan chair. In the offending episode, we also get to see Hammond trying to manoeuvre a monster truck through the back streets of Cartagena, in the process holding up an ambulance trying to attend an emergency. The moment passes with little more than a shrug. It\u2019s possibly written into the contract that Clarkson and co must also cast lazy aspersions on \u201cthe locals\u201d, much as they did on the BBC\u2019s Top Gear. Back then Romania was \u201cBorat country\u201d and full of Gypsies; now, in an absurdly contrived set-piece, rural Colombians are donkey-shaggers. Such japes. The phrase \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d is overused, deployed to describe all manner of male infractions, but here it is apt, highlighting the raging entitlement and inherent smugness of three white men telling it like it is and waging their mid-life war against untrammelled political correctness, the liberal disease that saw them hounded off the BBC.

Ashley\u2019s near 12 years as owner have been characterised by budget buys but perhaps motivated by real fears that Rafael Ben\u00edtez could be on the point of quitting as manager, the retail tycoon belatedly sanctioned a long-mooted deal for the Paraguay playmaker. The 24-year-old was very much the star of the Major League Soccer side Atlanta and Ben\u00edtez trusts he will fill the No 10 position that has long been a problem role at St James\u2019 Park. Almir\u00f3n describes his high-profile switch as both \u201csomething beautiful\u201d and \u201ca big responsibility\u201d. He has agreed a five-and-a-half-year deal and his first priority will be to help create \u2013 and score \u2013 the goals required to relieve Newcastle\u2019s relegation fears and keep them in the Premier League. Ashley hopes that his presence may not only persuade Ben\u00edtez to extend a contract which expires in May but also prevent a sharp dip in season ticket sales. Capped 13 times, Almir\u00f3n\u2019s quick feet and link play helped Atlanta win last season\u2019s MLS Cup and he was selected in the MLS Best XI at the end of both of his seasons with the club.

In an \u201cindustry warning notice\u201d, the commission said it was aware that some companies had included non-disclosure clauses within settlements with consumers, adding that it was continuing its investigation into these. In one case, reported by the Guardian, Ladbrokes, one of Britain\u2019s biggest bookmakers, agreed to pay nearly \u00a31m to the victims of a problem gambler who had stolen the money he was using to bet, in return for a pledge not to inform the watchdog. The gambler, a British citizen who ran a property business in Dubai, later admitted to having stolen from his clients in order to fund his gambling, which ran up to \u00a360,000 a day. After five of his victims made a complaint against Ladbrokes for allegedly accepting stolen funds, the bookmaker agreed to pay them a combined sum of \u00a3975,000. According to a settlement agreement seen by the Guardian, Ladbrokes demanded that they agreed \u201cnot to bring any complaint, or make any report to any regulator in relation to the claim\u201d in order to receive the money\u201d.

Italy\u2019s national statistical office has not yet published the GDP components, but it stated that net trade provided a positive contribution to growth, while domestic demand was negative.</li> <li>We expect Italy\u2019s consumer demand to have remain subdued and investment to have dropped for the second consecutive quarter during Q4, due to lower business confidence, higher uncertainty and lower supply of credit.</li> <li>The government\u2019s narrative that the problems are mainly from abroad is at odds with some of the data since net trade was positive for the second consecutive quarter while Spanish and France GDP numbers were more solid in Q4 (respectively at +0.7% and +0.3%).</li> <li>Moreover, the gap between Italian GDP growth and that of the rest of the Eurozone has been widening again, reinforcing our view that idiosyncratic factors (such as negative market reactions, uncertainty and falling confidence) have played a big part. </li> <li>Looking forward, the moderation in domestic financial market stress and the stabilisation in some indicators, such as employment, should set the stage for a stabilisation in Italian GDP in Q1 2019, but the risks remain clearly on the downside. The recession could drag on into the first half of 2019, particularly if confidence continues to disappoint.</li> <li>Given the worse than expected GDP number in Q4, we will very likely revise down our Italy forecasts (currently at an already weak 0.3%).</li> <li>019 will very likely be remembered as a year of no growth in Italy \u2212 not a great track-record for the first year of the populist government. </li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f6cce8211b76ff6499a0a6bf023760a1da9e216\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f6cce8211b76ff6499a0a6bf023760a1da9e216/0_0_531_401/500.jpg\" alt=\"Italian GDP\" width=\"500\" height=\"378\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Italian GDP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Istat/Oxford Economics</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c52fad3e4b0e0e1bbc2452c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-31T13:41:32.953Z\">1.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Italy\u2019s stock market has not taken the recession well.</strong></p> <p>The FTSE MIB index of top Italian companies has dropped by 0.7%, or 133 points to 19,638, making it the worst-performing major European index today.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c52f47ae4b01125b082a7ba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-31T13:22:38.034Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Economist Nicola Nobile doesn\u2019t believe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/jan/31/uk-house-prices-brexit-eurozone-gdp-italy-business-live?page=with:block-5c52e85fe4b01125b082a6e7#block-5c52e85fe4b01125b082a6e7\">PM Conte\u2019s line</a> that trade conflict dragged Italy into recession:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/niconobivalgre/status/1090918293018497024\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Recession in ITA.

That\u2019s a weak figure after the bloc had started the year predicting only a modest slowdown from 2017\u2019s 2.3% rate. </p> <p>The eurozone has also been hobbled by an unexpected slowdown in Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy, which suffered an unexpected contraction in the third quarter largely due to changes in emissions standards that snarled auto sales. And uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU has weighed on sentiment. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c52d173e4b0e764aa15122c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-31T10:55:17.429Z\">10.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/jan/31/uk-house-prices-brexit-eurozone-gdp-italy-business-live?page=with:block-5c52c886e4b01125b082a546#block-5c52c886e4b01125b082a546\">This slide into recession </a>is a blow for Italy\u2019s coalition government, and caps a turbulent year.</strong></p> <p>It means Italy\u2019s economy has been shrinking steadily since the right wing League Party formed a coalition with the anti-establishment Movement Five Star.</p> <p>That coalition spent months battling with Brussels over their plans to cut taxes and boost spending - arguing that Italy\u2019s economy needed a stimulus.<br></p> <p>However, the resulting political crisis appears to have hurt economic confidence, as well as driving up Italy\u2019s borrowing costs.</p> <p>Now that Italy is in recession, the growth targets which underpin Rome\u2019s 2019 budget now look very unrealistic.

of housing market activity, such as the number of property transactions and the number of mortgages approved for house purchase, have remained broadly stable in recent months, but forward-looking indicators had suggested some softening was likely.</p> <p>\u201cIn particular, measures of consumer confidence weakened in December and surveyors reported a further fall in new buyer enquiries towards the end of 2018. While the number of properties coming onto the market also slowed, this doesn\u2019t appear to have been enough to prevent a modest shift in the balance of demand and supply in favour of buyers in recent months. </p> </blockquote> <p>With a touch of understatement, Gardner adds that the economic outlook remains \u201cunusually uncertain\u201d. Bu he\u2019s hopeful that prices might pick up this year <strong><em>if</em></strong> economic conditions hold up.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the economy continues to grow at a modest pace, with the unemployment rate and borrowing costs remaining close to current levels, we would expect UK house prices to rise at a low single-digit pace in 2019.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Reaction to follow....</em></p> <h2>Also coming up today</h2> <p>Italy might fall into recession this morning!

      "bodyText": "And finally (I think), here\u2019s our news story about Italy\u2019s downturn: Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Three recessions in barely a decade, and not too much growth in between.... Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte is adamant that Italy\u2019s economy will recover this year. Here\u2019s what he told reporters: \u201cI\u2019m not at all worried ... Even the most naive analysts know that at this moment there is a trade war going on between the United States and China. Above all, Germany is holding us back ... it\u2019s a transitional phase, which depends on external factors We are interested in focusing on the relaunch of our economy, which will certainly take place in 2019 ... This relaunch will hit full capacity in the second half.\u201d But is Germany really to blame? We know that the eurozone\u2019s largest economy did contract in July-September, and more recent data has been disappointing too. However, German Q4 GDP data hasn\u2019t been released yet. Also France, which is vulnerable to the same forces, actually grew by 0.3% in the last quarter - despite the disruption from the Yellow Vest protests. Germany\u2019s slowdown hasn\u2019t helped, but Italy\u2019s problems go deeper. Italy\u2019s slide into recession leaves a \u201cblack mark\u201d on its populist government\u2019s early track record, says Oxford Economics. Here\u2019s their take: In Italy, recent data show that its economy fell into recession in the second half of last year. The first estimate of Italy GDP published today showed a drop in GDP of 0.2% in Q4 \u2212 a touch worse than our estimate. Italy\u2019s national statistical office has not yet published the GDP components, but it stated that net trade provided a positive contribution to growth, while domestic demand was negative. We expect Italy\u2019s consumer demand to have remain subdued and investment to have dropped for the second consecutive quarter during Q4, due to lower business confidence, higher uncertainty and lower supply of credit. The government\u2019s narrative that the problems are mainly from abroad is at odds with some of the data since net trade was positive for the second consecutive quarter while Spanish and France GDP numbers were more solid in Q4 (respectively at +0.7% and +0.3%). Moreover, the gap between Italian GDP growth and that of the rest of the Eurozone has been widening again, reinforcing our view that idiosyncratic factors (such as negative market reactions, uncertainty and falling confidence) have played a big part. Looking forward, the moderation in domestic financial market stress and the stabilisation in some indicators, such as employment, should set the stage for a stabilisation in Italian GDP in Q1 2019, but the risks remain clearly on the downside. The recession could drag on into the first half of 2019, particularly if confidence continues to disappoint. Given the worse than expected GDP number in Q4, we will very likely revise down our Italy forecasts (currently at an already weak 0.3%). 019 will very likely be remembered as a year of no growth in Italy \u2212 not a great track-record for the first year of the populist government. Italy\u2019s stock market has not taken the recession well. The FTSE MIB index of top Italian companies has dropped by 0.7%, or 133 points to 19,638, making it the worst-performing major European index today. Economist Nicola Nobile doesn\u2019t believe PM Conte\u2019s line that trade conflict dragged Italy into recession: Italy\u2019s problem isn\u2019t simply that it\u2019s suffered three recessions in a decade - although that\u2019s bad enough. It has also struggled to post significant growth in the upturns between the downturns - meaning it has steadily lagged behind eurozone neighbours. That stagnation eventually led to the election of its current populist government - who argued passionately that the only route out of the mess was to tax less, and spend more. That Keynesian approach, through, doesn\u2019t square with the eurozone\u2019s fiscal targets, especially as Italy has to service a huge national debt of \u20ac2.3 trillion. Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, seems to have blamed the recession on the US-China trade war.... Andrea Iannelli, investment director at Fidelity International, says Italy was dragged into recession by problems at home, and abroad: \u201cThe latest Italian GDP numbers may come as no surprise to investors, but it does highlight the challenges that still lie ahead for the country and the coalition government. The slowdown in the country\u2019s major trading partners are partly to blame. However, the standoff between the government and the European authorities over the budget in the summer of 2018 has exacerbated the country\u2019s weaknesses. One of the leaders of Italy\u2019s coalition partners has blamed his predecessors, and European austerity, for the country\u2019s economic mess. Deputy PM Luigi Di Maio, head of Movement Five Star, says the recession is proof that Europe\u2019s budget rules should be relaxed - to allow Italy to stimulate its economy back to growth. He\u2019s clearly still unhappy that Rome\u2019s attempts to run a deficit of 2.4% of GDP this year were blocked by the EU. Di Maio said the previous centre-left government - ousted this spring - was to blame for the recession. He added that this year\u2019s EU parliamentary elections will effectively be a referendum on eurozone fiscal policy, saying: \u201cI believe this referendum will have a positive outcome for those who are against austerity.\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the quotes) If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s take on Italy\u2019s fall back into recession. The Italian economy slipped into recession in the final three months of the year, weighing on the wider eurozone\u2019s growth, official figures showed Thursday. The Italian statistics agency said that Italy, the third-largest economy in the 19-country eurozone, contracted by a quarterly rate of 0.2% in the fourth quarter. Following a 0.1% drop in GDP in the previous three-month period, that means Italy is in a technical recession, defined as two straight quarters of economic contraction. The Italian economy has been hobbled by a lack of confidence and waning business activity following the new populist government\u2019s spat with the European Union\u2019s executive Commission over its budget plans. The recession in Italy has weighed on the wider eurozone, which grew by only 0.2% in the final three months of 2018, the same as in the previous quarter. As a result, EU statistics agency Eurostat said that the eurozone expanded by 1.8% in 2018 overall. That\u2019s a weak figure after the bloc had started the year predicting only a modest slowdown from 2017\u2019s 2.3% rate. The eurozone has also been hobbled by an unexpected slowdown in Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy, which suffered an unexpected contraction in the third quarter largely due to changes in emissions standards that snarled auto sales. And uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU has weighed on sentiment. This slide into recession is a blow for Italy\u2019s coalition government, and caps a turbulent year. It means Italy\u2019s economy has been shrinking steadily since the right wing League Party formed a coalition with the anti-establishment Movement Five Star. That coalition spent months battling with Brussels over their plans to cut taxes and boost spending - arguing that Italy\u2019s economy needed a stimulus. However, the resulting political crisis appears to have hurt economic confidence, as well as driving up Italy\u2019s borrowing costs. Now that Italy is in recession, the growth targets which underpin Rome\u2019s 2019 budget now look very unrealistic. That means its government may have to choose between dropping spending plans, raising taxes, or blowing through its deficit targets. AsJames Athey of Aberdeen Standard Investments puts it (via Bloomberg): \u201cThe growth forecasts on which the budget was based have already been blown out of the water and euro-zone growth continues to weaken. Italy is going to have to face up to some real problems.\u201d 2018 was not a vintage year for the euro area. Eurostat estimates that eurozone GDP grew by 1.8% during 2018 as a whole, down from 2.5% in 2017. Analysts are pointing out that Italy\u2019s long-term economic performance is pretty dire. Here\u2019s Arne Petimezas, analyst at AFS Group: Fred Ducrozet of Pictet Asset Management flags up that Italy is, by some distance, the worst-performing Big Four eurozone member. Italy\u2019s economy has barely grown over the last year - today\u2019s report shows GDP only rose by 0.1% annually. Indeed, Italy has only managed meagre growth since the financial crisis: Sky\u2019s News\u2019s Ed Conway points out that Italy is the first G7 economy to plunge into recession in over three years: You can see the Italian GDP report online, here. Italy has plunged back into recession! New GDP figures show that its economy shrank by 0.2% in the final three months of 2018, a worse result than expected. That follows a 0.1% contraction in July-September, meaning Italy is now officially in a technical recession. Statistics body Istat says: The quarter on quarter change is the result of a decrease of value added in agriculture, forestry and fishing as well as in industry and a substantial stability in services. From the demand side, there is a negative contribution by the domestic component (gross of change in inventories) and a positive one by the net export component. Newsflash: The eurozone economy grew by 0.2% in the last quarter, as the region continues to post lacklustre growth. That matches the 0.2% expansion recorded in the third quarter of 2018, and is the joint-weakest growth in four years. It means that the eurozone has only expanded by 1.2% compared to Q4 2017 -- a weak performance. The broader European Union expanded by 0.3% in the last quarter, and by 1.5% compared to Q4 2017. More to follow.... It\u2019s not just houses that are catching a Brexit chill. Overnight, we\u2019re learned that British car production fell to a five-year low in 2018. The industry is blaming the risk of a no-deal Brexit -- would you invest in new machinery if you feared massive queues at the ports and supply chain disruption within weeks? Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says: \u201cThe uncertainty created by Brexit is largely responsible for the further decline in year-over-year growth in house prices to near-zero, from a broadly stable rate of about 2% in the 18 months before November.\u201d Here\u2019s our full story on the UK house price slowdown: Spain\u2019s economy has beaten expectations, giving investors some relief as they await the main eurozone growth figures at 10am UK time. Spanish GDP rose by 0.7% in the October-December quarter, a little faster than expected. That\u2019s an encouraging sign, a day after France also beat forecasts with 0.3% growth. We had been expecting Italian growth figures by now, but I think they might actually be out at 10am.... Will Rome avoid a recession? Over in the City, shares are rallying on relief that America\u2019s central bank has pledged to be patient before raising interest rates -- a sign that borrowing costs could stay on hold for a while. The FTSE 100 has gained almost 50 points to its highest level in almost three weeks, while European indices have hit a two-month high. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx has the details: Keen to play catch up after spending much of January\u2019s back end in the red, the FTSE continued its month-closing rally on Thursday, the index lifting another 50 points to make eyes at 7000. It wasn\u2019t just the macro-landscape that gave the index a boost; it also received a helping hand from some of its key components. Shell\u2019s 36% surge in annual profits sent the oil giant 3.5% higher as the session got underway, while Diageo rose 3.7% after getting a sizeable round in, the Guinness and Smirnoff-owner announcing a \u00a3660 million share buyback. The drop in prices since last summer means UK houses are slightly more affordable (or slightly less unaffordable). But as these charts show, housing is still much more expensive - compared to wages - than 20 years ago, and not much cheaper than before the financial crisis. London estate agents Foxtons - known for its hefty fees and garish minis - is also finding lift tough. Foxtons has reported that adjusted profits are expected to have plunged by 80% last year -- to just \u00a33m, down from \u00a315m in 2017, with revenues dropping from \u00a3118m, to \u00a3111m. Nic Budden, CEO, says last year was one of the worst ever: \u201c2018 was one of the toughest sales markets we have ever had in London with transactions falling from last year\u2019s historically low levels. Considering this, we have delivered a solid performance and taken steps to ensure the business is best prepared for these conditions through prudent actions on cost and enhancements to our proposition. We are confident in our model which provides high levels of service to achieve the best results for our customers. Foxtons has also taken a \u00a316m charge this morning, including \u00a36m to cover the cost of closing branches. Economist Howard Archer of EY Item Club warns that the housing market will be driven by the Brexit saga this year: If the UK ultimately manages to leave the EU with a \u201cdeal\u201d at the end of March, we expect UK house prices to eke out a modest gain of 2% over 2019. A likely gradual pick-up in consumers\u2019 real income growth should help the housing market in 2019, while high employment, still low interest rates and a shortage of houses on the market will also likely offer some support If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March without an approved Brexit \u201cdeal\u201d, house prices could fall by around 5% in 2019 amid heightened uncertainty and weakened economic activity If Brexit is delayed, ongoing uncertainty is likely to weigh down on the housing market and could well see house prices stagnate or even fall slightly Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, also blames economic anxiety for the house price slowdown. \u2018Uncertainty seems to be the main issue plaguing the housing market, with potential buyers and sellers sitting on their hands and waiting to see what happens with Brexit. This means lenders should be offering attractive deals to anyone seeking a mortgage, he adds. North London estate agent Jeremy Leaf says the UK housing market is \u201cstruggling to weather the Brexit storm but not collapsing\u201d The average UK house now costs almost \u00a3220,000, Nationwide reports, around \u00a35,000 less than last summer. Good news for first-time buyers, of course. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s housing market is feeling the chill from Brexit, with prices stagnating as economic uncertainty builds. New figures from Nationwide show that prices are only 0.1% higher than a year ago, down from 0.5% annual growth in December. That\u2019s the lowest annual growth rate since February 2013. The average house price is now lower than in the summer, even though prices rose 0.3% in January after a sharp fall in December. It\u2019s another sign that the economy is feeling the pressure, with less than two months until Britain is due to leave the EU. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s Chief Economist, says annual house price growth \u201calmost ground to a complete halt in January\u201d. Gardner blames the \u201cuncertain economic outlook\u201d for dragging the housing market down. \u201cIndicators of housing market activity, such as the number of property transactions and the number of mortgages approved for house purchase, have remained broadly stable in recent months, but forward-looking indicators had suggested some softening was likely. \u201cIn particular, measures of consumer confidence weakened in December and surveyors reported a further fall in new buyer enquiries towards the end of 2018. While the number of properties coming onto the market also slowed, this doesn\u2019t appear to have been enough to prevent a modest shift in the balance of demand and supply in favour of buyers in recent months. With a touch of understatement, Gardner adds that the economic outlook remains \u201cunusually uncertain\u201d. Bu he\u2019s hopeful that prices might pick up this year if economic conditions hold up. If the economy continues to grow at a modest pace, with the unemployment rate and borrowing costs remaining close to current levels, we would expect UK house prices to rise at a low single-digit pace in 2019.\u201d Reaction to follow.... Also coming up today Italy might fall into recession this morning! New eurozone GDP figures, due at 10am, may show the euro area\u2019s third-largest member contracted by 0.1% for the second quarter in a row. The wider eurozone is only expected to have grown by 0.2%. European stock markets may make gains, following a strong rally on Wall Street last night after the Federal Reserve said it would be patient about raising interest rates again. The agenda: 10am 9am GMT: Italian GDP for Q4 2018 10am GMT: Eurozone GDP for Q4 2018 1.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless figures",

The phenomenon became widely known to Americans during a particularly frigid spell in 2014, when the media first started using the term \u201cpolar vortex\u201d. It was also a factor in the \u201cbomb cyclone\u201d that battered the US east coast last year. This time, the polar vortex has broken in two, bringing the coldest conditions in decades to the midwest US. On Wednesday, Chicago was 10 degrees F colder than Antarctica. \u201cAt the moment the vortex looks like two swirling blobs of cold air, one settled over North America, the other over Eurasia,\u201d said Jennifer Francis, the senior scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center. \u201cIt splits up when there is sudden stratospheric warming.\u201d Is this weather event linked to climate change? Studies have pointed to a recent increase in instances where the polar vortex has bulged down into heavily populated areas. Scientists are gaining a better understanding of why this is happening, with many identifying climate change as an influence. There\u2019s some evidence that the jet stream, a meandering air current that flows over North America and Europe, is slowing and becoming wavier as the planet warms. The jet stream interacts with the polar vortex, helping bring numbing temperatures further south. Scientists also point to a complex sequence of events involving sea ice, which is rapidly diminishing in the Arctic. As the ice retreats, summertime heat is absorbed by the dark ocean that lies underneath. This heat is released into the atmosphere during winter, spurring winds that can disrupt the polar vortex. \u201cWe aren\u2019t entirely there yet but there\u2019s more and more support for this concept,\u201d said Francis. \u201cIt\u2019s a new and developing hot research topic.\u201d Doesn\u2019t global warming mean everywhere should be warm? Well, Donald Trump certainly thinks so. \u201cIn coming days, expected to get even colder. People can\u2019t last outside even for minutes,\u201d the US president tweeted on Monday. \u201cWhat the hell is going on with Global Waming (sic)? Please come back fast, we need you!\u201d Scientists were quick to point out climate change\u2019s role in allowing Arctic air to flow south, as well as to remind the president that winters still exist. A localized, albeit large, cold snap isn\u2019t representative of the rest of the planet, as Australians currently sweltering in searing record heat of more than 46C (114F) will be well aware of. The past four years have been the hottest on record for the globe. In the US, record-breaking high temperatures are outnumbering record lows by a ratio of two to one. Research suggests this ratio will expand to 16 heat records for every cold record set if the US warms by 3C (5.4F) this century, which is likely unless greenhouse gases are severely curtailed. Trump\u2019s repeated tweets mocking climate science when the temperature drops are \u201cridiculous, in a word\u201d, said Francis. \u201cHe cares not to understand. It\u2019s the only explanation.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Even in an exceptionally gifted generation of French pianists, <a href=\"https://www.cedrictiberghien.com/\">C\u00e9dric Tiberghien</a> stands out for the breadth of his musical sympathies. His solo repertory ranges from Bach to Boulez, and his recordings reflect that span, yet this is Tiberghien\u2019s first foray into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/franz-liszt\">Liszt</a> on record. His selection is typically thoughtful, avoiding the barnstorming, high-Romantic pieces and concentrating instead on music that Liszt composed in the last decade or so of his life.</p> <p>The seven numbers that make up the third book of the Ann\u00e9es de P\u00e8lerinage were mostly composed in the 1870s (only the penultimate Marche Fun\u00e8bre is earlier), and are very different from the pieces in the two previous volumes, which had appeared two decades earlier. Their mood is more contemplative, and their language more forward-looking, sometimes \u2013 as in the most famous of the set, Les Jeux d\u2019Eau \u00e0 la Villa d\u2019Este \u2013 tending towards the world of Debussy and Ravel, sometimes even hinting at the expressionism of the Second Viennese School.</p> <p>Each is a scaled-down tone poem, which poses its own set of technical challenges. But Tiberghien never flaunts his total command of those challenges and with an exemplary range of touch and keyboard colour, concentrates instead on these pieces purely as musical statements. It\u2019s logical too for him to complete his collection with six of Liszt\u2019s piano pieces from the 1880s, including the Bagatelle sans Tonalit\u00e9, the troubled nocturne Schlaflos! Frage und Antwort, the Tristan-haunted second of the Lugubre Gondola sequence, and the unfinished fourth Mephisto Waltz. It\u2019s music in which everything becomes enigmatic and ambiguous, and which regularly loses its tonal bearings; Tiberghien presents all of them as perfectly conceived miniatures that often pose more questions than they answer.</p> <p>The 12 Transcendental Studies, which reached their final form in 1852, a quarter of a century after they were conceived, are the epitome of Liszt\u2019s early bravura style. New accounts of the complete set from <strong><a href=\"https://borisgiltburg.com/\">Boris Giltburg</a></strong> on Naxos and <strong><a href=\"https://gugnin.com/\">Andrey Gugnin</a></strong> for Piano Classics make a fascinating comparison.</p> <p>Though the overall timings of the two versions are within a few seconds of each other, their approaches are often sharply contrasted \u2013 Giltburg the more measured, Gugnin generally favouring extremes of fast and slow.</p> <p>There\u2019s no doubting the virtuosity of the two pianists, but neither of them probes far beneath the music\u2019s glittering surfaces; comparisons with <strong>Daniil Trifonov</strong>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/21/liszt-transcendental-studies-paganini-review-daniil-trifonov-deutsche-grammophon-cd-classical\">dazzling 2016 accounts</a> of the studies quickly reveal what\u2019s missing in both.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Even in an exceptionally gifted generation of French pianists, C\u00e9dric Tiberghien stands out for the breadth of his musical sympathies. His solo repertory ranges from Bach to Boulez, and his recordings reflect that span, yet this is Tiberghien\u2019s first foray into Liszt on record. His selection is typically thoughtful, avoiding the barnstorming, high-Romantic pieces and concentrating instead on music that Liszt composed in the last decade or so of his life. The seven numbers that make up the third book of the Ann\u00e9es de P\u00e8lerinage were mostly composed in the 1870s (only the penultimate Marche Fun\u00e8bre is earlier), and are very different from the pieces in the two previous volumes, which had appeared two decades earlier. Their mood is more contemplative, and their language more forward-looking, sometimes \u2013 as in the most famous of the set, Les Jeux d\u2019Eau \u00e0 la Villa d\u2019Este \u2013 tending towards the world of Debussy and Ravel, sometimes even hinting at the expressionism of the Second Viennese School. Each is a scaled-down tone poem, which poses its own set of technical challenges. But Tiberghien never flaunts his total command of those challenges and with an exemplary range of touch and keyboard colour, concentrates instead on these pieces purely as musical statements. It\u2019s logical too for him to complete his collection with six of Liszt\u2019s piano pieces from the 1880s, including the Bagatelle sans Tonalit\u00e9, the troubled nocturne Schlaflos! Frage und Antwort, the Tristan-haunted second of the Lugubre Gondola sequence, and the unfinished fourth Mephisto Waltz. It\u2019s music in which everything becomes enigmatic and ambiguous, and which regularly loses its tonal bearings; Tiberghien presents all of them as perfectly conceived miniatures that often pose more questions than they answer. The 12 Transcendental Studies, which reached their final form in 1852, a quarter of a century after they were conceived, are the epitome of Liszt\u2019s early bravura style. New accounts of the complete set from Boris Giltburg on Naxos and Andrey Gugnin for Piano Classics make a fascinating comparison. Though the overall timings of the two versions are within a few seconds of each other, their approaches are often sharply contrasted \u2013 Giltburg the more measured, Gugnin generally favouring extremes of fast and slow. There\u2019s no doubting the virtuosity of the two pianists, but neither of them probes far beneath the music\u2019s glittering surfaces; comparisons with Daniil Trifonov\u2019s dazzling 2016 accounts of the studies quickly reveal what\u2019s missing in both.",

The 0.2% drop in the eurozone\u2019s third largest economy between October and December followed a 0.1% fall in the previous three months, the Italian statistics agency said. Declining GDP growth over two consecutive quarters put Italy in recession. It is the third time the country has fallen into recession in a decade. Amid weakening growth rates across the eurozone, which led to the 19-member currency bloc increasing its GDP by only 0.2% in the final three months of 2018, Italy is likely to be forced to rewrite its forecasts for growth in 2019. James Athey of Aberdeen Standard Investments said: \u201cThe growth forecasts on which the budget was based have already been blown out of the water and eurozone growth continues to weaken. Italy is going to have to face up to some real problems.\u201d Italy\u2019s economy has been shrinking steadily since the rightwing League party formed a coalition with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement. Analysts have blamed much of the slump on a running battle between Rome and Brussels over the coalition\u2019s plans to increase its budget deficit and stimulate the economy with a range of tax cuts and spending increases. The dispute ran for months, hurting economic confidence and driving up Italy\u2019s borrowing costs, before a settlement was reached just before Christmas. Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, blamed the recession on external factors, including trade tensions between the US and China. The deputy prime minister Luigi Di Maio, the head of the Five Star Movement, said the recession was proof that Europe\u2019s budget rules should be relaxed to allow Italy to stimulate its economy back to growth. Di Maio heaped blame for the downturn on the previous centre-left government, which was ousted last spring. He said this year\u2019s EU parliamentary elections would effectively be a referendum on eurozone fiscal policy, adding: \u201cI believe this referendum will have a positive outcome for those who are against austerity.\u201d Andrea Iannelli, an investment analyst at the fund manager Fidelity International, said the government was right to highlight falling demand from its neighbours and trade wars for the country\u2019s woes. \u201cHowever, the standoff between the government and the European authorities over the budget in the summer of 2018 has exacerbated the country\u2019s weaknesses. \u201cThe sell-off in Italian assets and rise in yields is now feeding through into tighter lending conditions and weaker macro data,\u201d he said. The EU statistics agency, Eurostat, said the eurozone expanded by 1.8% in 2018 overall, the slowest rate of growth since 2014 and significantly down from 2017\u2019s 2.3%. One indication of the general slowdown across the continent came from European companies listed on the Stoxx 600 index, which have begun to report weaker earnings growth. The latest analysis by I/B/E/S Refinitiv shows profits are rising by an average 3.6% compared with the 4.8% expected last week and the 6% expected at the beginning of the year. Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy, suffered an unexpected contraction in the third quarter largely because of changes in emissions standards that dented car sales. Uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU also weighed on sentiment that is expected to drag down growth in the final quarter when the data becomes available next month. German retail sales fell at their steepest rate since 2007 in December and exports of cars to China also declined. The dip in the eurozone\u2019s fortunes could prompt the European Central Bank, which predicted a 0.4% growth rate in the final quarter, to cut its growth forecast of 1.7% for 2019. In separate figures released by Eurostat, unemployment in the eurozone remained at 7.9%. It equalled its lowest rate in more than 10 years in December and matched economists\u2019 forecasts. The jobless rates fell slightly in Italy and Spain, which still have the highest unemployment levels in the eurozone after Greece. Across the eurozone 75,000 fewer people were out of work than in November. In the wider 28-country European Union, the jobless rate was 6.6% in December, also unchanged from November.",

The claim centres on how interest rates on those loans were influenced by Libor, the interbank lending rate. Barclays is among the lenders that have been fined for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/18/libor-scandal-the-bankers-who-fixed-the-worlds-most-important-number\">Libor rigging</a> since the banking crisis.</p> <p>The councils say the banks knew customers would rely on Libor rates, which Barclays was accused of lowballing, when deciding whether to enter into contracts. Barclays then has the power to raise interest rates over the lifetime of the lobo loans as part of the central terms.</p> <p>The councils have not demanded a specific financial figure in their court filings but are seeking permission to exit existing loans without incurring hefty fees and the restitution of sums paid in relation to the lobo loans, as well as interest payments and other costs.</p> <p>The legal case has been filed on behalf of councils in Leeds, the Greater Manchester combined authority, Newcastle, North East Lincolnshire, Nottingham, Oldham and Sheffield.</p> <p>These seven councils are believed to have borrowed up to \u00a3573m in lobo loans from Barclays, according to data collected through freedom of information requests by the <a href=\"https://debtresistance.uk/\">Debt Resistance UK</a> campaign group.</p> <p>The Guardian understands that the councils\u2019 claim is related to loans that account for a significant portion of the total sum.</p> <p>Lobos were popular among councils in the early 2000s as they came with teaser interest rates that kept payments low over the short term. They became expensive in the long term, however, as austerity and wider spending cuts took hold.</p> <p>The loans gave banks the power to raise interest rates at certain points over their lifetime, accounting for the \u201clender option\u201d of the loan agreement. Although borrowers had the option of rejecting those terms, it would trigger a clause forcing them to immediately repay the loan in full.</p> <p>In 2016, Barclays scrapped lobos by turning them into fixed-rate loans but interest payments were not necessarily affected and breakage costs were only slightly reduced. </p> <p>Joel Benjamin, an activist with Debt Resistance UK, said his organisation was \u201cheartened to see local councils filing legal action against Barclays related to lobo loans, which has resulted in hundreds of millions of pounds being skimmed from struggling town hall budgets \u2013 seven years on from Barclays and a cartel of global banks being fined for conspiring to rig Libor interest rates in 2012\u201d.</p> <p>Barclays declined to comment due to the ongoing legal proceedings.</p>",

The use of high-cost loans has come under fire from campaigners and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who say councils have been left on the hook for expensive interest payments that put further pressure on local services already squeezed by austerity and spending cuts. A high court claim has been lodged over the terms of the lender option borrower option loans, known as lobos, offered by Barclays between 2006 and 2008. The claim centres on how interest rates on those loans were influenced by Libor, the interbank lending rate. Barclays is among the lenders that have been fined for Libor rigging since the banking crisis. The councils say the banks knew customers would rely on Libor rates, which Barclays was accused of lowballing, when deciding whether to enter into contracts. Barclays then has the power to raise interest rates over the lifetime of the lobo loans as part of the central terms. The councils have not demanded a specific financial figure in their court filings but are seeking permission to exit existing loans without incurring hefty fees and the restitution of sums paid in relation to the lobo loans, as well as interest payments and other costs. The legal case has been filed on behalf of councils in Leeds, the Greater Manchester combined authority, Newcastle, North East Lincolnshire, Nottingham, Oldham and Sheffield. These seven councils are believed to have borrowed up to \u00a3573m in lobo loans from Barclays, according to data collected through freedom of information requests by the Debt Resistance UK campaign group. The Guardian understands that the councils\u2019 claim is related to loans that account for a significant portion of the total sum. Lobos were popular among councils in the early 2000s as they came with teaser interest rates that kept payments low over the short term. They became expensive in the long term, however, as austerity and wider spending cuts took hold. The loans gave banks the power to raise interest rates at certain points over their lifetime, accounting for the \u201clender option\u201d of the loan agreement. Although borrowers had the option of rejecting those terms, it would trigger a clause forcing them to immediately repay the loan in full. In 2016, Barclays scrapped lobos by turning them into fixed-rate loans but interest payments were not necessarily affected and breakage costs were only slightly reduced. Joel Benjamin, an activist with Debt Resistance UK, said his organisation was \u201cheartened to see local councils filing legal action against Barclays related to lobo loans, which has resulted in hundreds of millions of pounds being skimmed from struggling town hall budgets \u2013 seven years on from Barclays and a cartel of global banks being fined for conspiring to rig Libor interest rates in 2012\u201d. Barclays declined to comment due to the ongoing legal proceedings.",

      "body": "<p>Teresa Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo AKA Teri Gender Bender, frontwoman of the Mexican rock band <a href=\"https://www.lebutcherettesofficial.com/\" title=\"\">Le Butcherettes</a>, had just been stitched up after a violent fight with her mother when she locked herself in her bedroom and started writing.</p> <p>Her mother (who has bipolar disorder) was living with Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo in El Paso, Texas, at the time, having followed her from Guadalajara in Mexico. \u201cI got my guitar, just zoned everything out, and focused on the songs,\u201d Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo says. The resulting guttural, dark and defiant anthems \u2013 produced by Jerry Harrison of Talking Heads and the Modern Lovers \u2013 make up Le Butcherettes\u2019 fourth album, bi/MENTAL.</p> <p>After the fight, Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo knew she could no longer live with her mother, and bi/MENTAL is a collection of vivid, valedictory songs. \u201cFor once, come closer / Listen to my cry\u201d, she sings <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNf8dH_NnRU\" title=\"\">in the opening song, spider/WAVES</a>. And on another, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ4D8Fz2FVI\" title=\"\">strong/ENOUGH</a>, she hollers with her chest puffed out: \u201cMy heart is headed out the door / Don\u2019t need your abuse no more / Won\u2019t take your disrespect / I\u2019m smart enough, grown enough\u201d.</p> <p>When we sit down together on a mellow afternoon near the rooms she shares with her bandmates in Silver Lake, Los Angeles (they now live communally between El Paso and LA), Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo hasn\u2019t spoken to her mother for more than a year. The contrast between the singer in person and her stage persona is stark. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOpuuazvltI\" title=\"\">Teri Gender Bender is ferocious</a> and frenetic, as though she\u2019s just escaped a massacre, with wild, confrontational eyes and earthy, animalistic moves.</p> <p>She lives for stagediving and crowdsurfing and climbed the lighting rig while performing barefoot at Coachella in 2012. In person, however, she showers you with kindness as though making up for her own mistreatment, not only at the hands of her troubled mum, but also her father, who was violent when drunk and died of a heart attack when Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo was 12.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNf8dH_NnRU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PNf8dH_NnRU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo was born in Denver, Colorado, where her parents had moved to from Mexico City in the hope of finding work. But after her father\u2019s death, they moved back to Mexico, to be near family in Guadalajara. It was there, in 2007, that the first incarnation of Le Butcherettes \u2013 just Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo and her then drummer Auryn Jolene \u2013 was born. \u201cI was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/apr/11/feminine-mystique-betty-friedan-feminism\" title=\"\">Betty Friedan\u2019s book The Feminine Mystique</a>, on what it was like for an [educated] housewife in the 50s,\u201d she says. </p> <p>For their early shows, the pair wore aprons splattered with fake blood, and draped pieces of meat on the stage, signifying how Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo says the music industry largely treats Latina women. She fondly recalls commuting to shows carrying bags of raw meat by Greyhound bus, sitting next to people transporting caged chickens. \u201cIt was a little smelly but you know, what you do for your art,\u201d she shrugs. Her most memorable prop was a (chauvinist) pig\u2019s head: \u201cMy way of saying \u2018screw you guys\u2019.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Mexico, as much as there are many extra layers of threat lurking around the corners, there is an extra level of magic</p> <footer> <cite>Teri Gender Bender</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This was especially aimed at the industry sleazes who would not take her seriously. \u201cI had a lot of men checking me out, saying: \u2018I\u2019ll see what I can do for you.\u2019\u201d Even male rock bands from Guadalajara \u201ctraumatised me because they were so mean, very competitive, called me all these misogynistic things\u201d, she remembers. However, validation soon came. When Jack White\u2019s band the Dead Weather played in Mexico in 2009, they asked Le Butcherettes to open for them, and as well as playing their own headline shows, the band went on to support the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Queens of the Stone Age and the Flaming Lips. After Le Butcherettes supported Iggy and the Stooges, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIytkJFyIQ\" title=\"\">Iggy Pop sang in Spanish on</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIytkJFyIQ\" title=\"\">their 2015 album, A Raw Youth</a>.</p> <p>The day before our talk in Los Angeles, I ride south with the band, crossing the border into Tijuana for the second of a three-date headline run. The four acts on the bill consist mostly of Mexican women, including <a href=\"https://mixmag.net/feature/get-to-know-nina-dioz-the-rapper-on-the-cusp-of-international-recognition/2\" title=\"\">Ni\u00f1a Dioz</a>, the country\u2019s first out gay rapper. Being gay, or feminist, can incite brutal violence in Mexico. (Two days later, the remains of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/21/mexico-marbella-ibarra-murder-women-football\">Marbella Ibarra</a>, a pioneer of Mexican women\u2019s football are found near Tijuana.) \u201cTo play in Mexico is a mixture of many intense feelings,\u201d says Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo, \u201cof fear but mixed with a sense of togetherness and <em>orgullo </em>[pride] for the individuality of each woman. As much as there are many extra layers of threat lurking around the corners, there is an extra level of magic within the community.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2e5d19fca22a8ebb9379c09e5636dffa339a2e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2e5d19fca22a8ebb9379c09e5636dffa339a2e0/0_0_3617_2893/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teri Gender Bender of Le Butcherettes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teri Gender Bender of Le Butcherettes on stage in Seattle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mat Hayward/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Tijuana show takes place at a shabby courtyard venue called Moustache. The crowd bristles with clammy youth, and even though the sound system isn\u2019t up to much, the overwhelming blunt elation of everybody wilfully letting off steam makes the show thrilling.</p> <p>Violence is so rife in Mexico, says Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo, that you get desensitised. Guadalajara, she says, \u201cis a heavily populated territory for drug dealers, and a few years ago one of the main drug lords was killed, so the smaller tribes were fighting over territory. Just a block down from my house there was a guy hanging from a tree.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are all in the dead-parents club so that united us.

Her mother (who has bipolar disorder) was living with Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo in El Paso, Texas, at the time, having followed her from Guadalajara in Mexico. \u201cI got my guitar, just zoned everything out, and focused on the songs,\u201d Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo says. The resulting guttural, dark and defiant anthems \u2013 produced by Jerry Harrison of Talking Heads and the Modern Lovers \u2013 make up Le Butcherettes\u2019 fourth album, bi/MENTAL. After the fight, Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo knew she could no longer live with her mother, and bi/MENTAL is a collection of vivid, valedictory songs. \u201cFor once, come closer / Listen to my cry\u201d, she sings in the opening song, spider/WAVES. And on another, strong/ENOUGH, she hollers with her chest puffed out: \u201cMy heart is headed out the door / Don\u2019t need your abuse no more / Won\u2019t take your disrespect / I\u2019m smart enough, grown enough\u201d. When we sit down together on a mellow afternoon near the rooms she shares with her bandmates in Silver Lake, Los Angeles (they now live communally between El Paso and LA), Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo hasn\u2019t spoken to her mother for more than a year. The contrast between the singer in person and her stage persona is stark. Teri Gender Bender is ferocious and frenetic, as though she\u2019s just escaped a massacre, with wild, confrontational eyes and earthy, animalistic moves. She lives for stagediving and crowdsurfing and climbed the lighting rig while performing barefoot at Coachella in 2012. In person, however, she showers you with kindness as though making up for her own mistreatment, not only at the hands of her troubled mum, but also her father, who was violent when drunk and died of a heart attack when Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo was 12. Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo was born in Denver, Colorado, where her parents had moved to from Mexico City in the hope of finding work. But after her father\u2019s death, they moved back to Mexico, to be near family in Guadalajara. It was there, in 2007, that the first incarnation of Le Butcherettes \u2013 just Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo and her then drummer Auryn Jolene \u2013 was born. \u201cI was inspired by Betty Friedan\u2019s book The Feminine Mystique, on what it was like for an [educated] housewife in the 50s,\u201d she says. For their early shows, the pair wore aprons splattered with fake blood, and draped pieces of meat on the stage, signifying how Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo says the music industry largely treats Latina women. She fondly recalls commuting to shows carrying bags of raw meat by Greyhound bus, sitting next to people transporting caged chickens. \u201cIt was a little smelly but you know, what you do for your art,\u201d she shrugs. Her most memorable prop was a (chauvinist) pig\u2019s head: \u201cMy way of saying \u2018screw you guys\u2019.\u201d This was especially aimed at the industry sleazes who would not take her seriously. \u201cI had a lot of men checking me out, saying: \u2018I\u2019ll see what I can do for you.\u2019\u201d Even male rock bands from Guadalajara \u201ctraumatised me because they were so mean, very competitive, called me all these misogynistic things\u201d, she remembers. However, validation soon came. When Jack White\u2019s band the Dead Weather played in Mexico in 2009, they asked Le Butcherettes to open for them, and as well as playing their own headline shows, the band went on to support the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Queens of the Stone Age and the Flaming Lips. After Le Butcherettes supported Iggy and the Stooges, Iggy Pop sang in Spanish on their 2015 album, A Raw Youth. The day before our talk in Los Angeles, I ride south with the band, crossing the border into Tijuana for the second of a three-date headline run. The four acts on the bill consist mostly of Mexican women, including Ni\u00f1a Dioz, the country\u2019s first out gay rapper. Being gay, or feminist, can incite brutal violence in Mexico. (Two days later, the remains of Marbella Ibarra, a pioneer of Mexican women\u2019s football are found near Tijuana.) \u201cTo play in Mexico is a mixture of many intense feelings,\u201d says Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo, \u201cof fear but mixed with a sense of togetherness and orgullo [pride] for the individuality of each woman. As much as there are many extra layers of threat lurking around the corners, there is an extra level of magic within the community.\u201d The Tijuana show takes place at a shabby courtyard venue called Moustache. The crowd bristles with clammy youth, and even though the sound system isn\u2019t up to much, the overwhelming blunt elation of everybody wilfully letting off steam makes the show thrilling. Violence is so rife in Mexico, says Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo, that you get desensitised. Guadalajara, she says, \u201cis a heavily populated territory for drug dealers, and a few years ago one of the main drug lords was killed, so the smaller tribes were fighting over territory. Just a block down from my house there was a guy hanging from a tree.\u201d When her mother was a young theatre performer in Mexico City, she broke her leg jumping from a moving van to escape kidnappers before they shot her boyfriend in the head. \u201cIt\u2019s called express kidnapping and it\u2019s very common,\u201d says Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo. \u201cI know at least 20 people that have been through it.\u201d Through Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo\u2019s songs, all of this chaos, violence and unfairness is not only expressed but embraced. While the songs came from a hellish place, once she brought them to her three bandmates, she says, \u201cI felt a kind of closure, because we are all in the dead-parents club.\u201d Riko and Marfred Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez (brothers of Omar from the Mars Volta and At the Drive In), on guitar and synths, trumpet and bass respectively, lost their mother in 2012. Drummer Alejandra Robles Luna\u2019s father had died, too, \u201cso that united us. A lot of the songs are inspired by death.\u201d Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo\u2019s mother finally got a diagnosis for bipolar disorder, but she distrusts doctors. \u201cI feel horrible because I know she\u2019s sick,\u201d says Su\u00e1rez Cos\u00edo. She also hopes that their estrangement turns out to be a break, \u201cbecause I obviously can\u2019t live without her for ever\u201d. bi/MENTAL is released on Rise Records on 1 February. Le Butcherettes play in Manchester, 1 April and London, 2 April.",

Delay, rethink, renegotiate \u2013 or a final say for the voters \u2013 these are all more plausible than the Commons opting for no deal. Though she has badly misjudged every stage of Brexit, even she will surely pull back at the last moment. Why would she want to captain the ship when a no-deal tsunami swamps the decks? Surely not. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

The report\u2019s authors challenged the government on its claim that the UK\u2019s export controls system is \u201camong the best and most robust in the world, with each application assessed on a case-by-case basis\u201d, a stock response to criticism of existing measures. The report called for comparison with states such as Germany, where there is a \u201cmore restrictive and accountable approach\u201d to weapon supplies in Yemen, and questioned why CAEC have consistently failed to hold the government to account. \u201cThe largest failing of the UK export control system in the last decade or more, by a mile, is the government\u2019s willingness to supply the Saudi- and UAE-led war effort in Yemen,\u201d said Isbister. \u201cCAEC had almost nothing to say on the matter in last year\u2019s report; Yemen is completely absent from the terms of reference for the current enquiry, and we are at a loss to understand why.\u201d The Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle said: \u201cI share the concern of NGOs that CAEC is ineffective at holding the government to account over its routine contravention of its own arms export controls. It is extremely deferential to the government, which rejects even the most piecemeal of its recommendations. I hope that this year members will work together to push the government for a radical overhaul of licensing, enforcement and auditing.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 21 February 2019 to clarify that the Acled fatality data deals only with conflict-related deaths in Yemen since 2016; detail was added of the total estimated death toll, which excludes death by disease and malnutrition. In addition, we said the infrastructure data was compiled by Acled, when it was in fact the Yemen Data Project.",

You are more adaptable to different types of coaching and different ways of playing because you are still learning. When you\u2019re older you have established principles in your mind. I had to leave my house and my friends and family behind, which adds to the difficulty, but when you\u2019re young you don\u2019t think about that. You just want to play football every day and score goals. I think it\u2019s a win-win situation. It\u2019s a bit like going to university, like so many people do at that age \u2013 you\u2019re a sponge and you meet all these new friends and experience all these new things. And you develop. For a few years some English clubs have had close connections with clubs in Europe such as Chelsea\u2019s with Vitesse, but Bayern\u2019s interest in Hudson-Odoi has shown there is another level of opportunity in Europe . Hopefully it will help our young players and the England national team to keep improving. The old argument has always been that the path is blocked for young players because of so many established overseas internationals in the Premier League. But now you can go elsewhere else and make your name.",

But once introduced, Brown peppered him with questions about his union benefits and his pension.</p> <p>Afterward, her father delivered his verdict: \u201cHe\u2019s us, in a tie.\u201d</p> <p>Brown has cultivated a \u201crumpled\u201d image, so much so that even a fresh haircut generated buzz about his presidential ambitions. (His wife <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ConnieSchultz/status/1072614574019538948\">offered</a> an alternative: \u201cYou know, honey, you just don\u2019t have the schedule for regular haircuts.

When the legislature was not in session, Brown spent his time in union halls, with the workers who would stand by him even as they steadily drifted from the Democratic party.</p> <p>Brown was elected to the House of Representatives in 1992, where he began to distinguish himself as one of the more liberal members of his party.

      "bodyText": "Sherrod Brown may not have decided yet whether he\u2019s running for the White House in 2020. But the Ohio Democrat certainly sounded like a candidate vying for a chance to take on Donald Trump. On Wednesday night, the senator previewed his populist, pro-worker message to a hometown crowd in Brunswick, near Cleveland \u2013 the official launch of his \u201cDignity of Work\u201d tour that will wind through the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. In his remarks here, Brown laid out the themes that would likely shape a presidential campaign while drawing a sharp contrast with the president. \u201cDonald Trump doesn\u2019t respect the dignity of work \u2013 he has betrayed workers,\u201d Brown, 66, told the crowd of more than 200 longtime supporters, union workers and liberal activists who braved the sub-zero temperatures gripping the region to attend. He accused Trump of peddling \u201cphony populism to distract from the fact that he has used the White House to enrich billionaires like himself\u201d. \u201cReal populism is not racist,\u201d Brown said, his gravelly baritone rasping as he became more animated. \u201cReal populism is never antisemitic. Real populists don\u2019t engage in hate speech. And real populists don\u2019t rip babies from their families at the border.\u201d While Brown draws clear distinctions between his brand from Trump-style populism, he has also set himself apart from the fiery liberalism embraced by some of his colleagues and potential challengers. He has so far not endorsed key progressive priorities such as Medicare for All or a Green New Deal. \u201cIf he\u2019s going to claim the mantle of working-class hero then he has to also embrace the economic populist policies that are popular with voters,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, spokesman for Justice Democrats, a political action committee that supports progressive candidates. Still, his supporters believe the senator is uniquely positioned to be the party\u2019s standard-bearer in 2020. \u201cAn economic populist from the midwest? He\u2019s a unicorn in this race,\u201d said Nan Whaley, the mayor of Dayton, and a co-chair of an effort to \u201cdraft\u201d Brown into running. She argued that Brown\u2019s message \u2013 which is often cast as a cri de c\u0153ur for \u201cwhite working-class\u201d voters who abandoned Democrats for Trump in 2016 \u2013 has a far more universal appeal. \u201cThe worker is women. The worker is folks of color. The worker is white guys,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cSherrod isn\u2019t choosing between them. He\u2019s advocating for all of them.\u201d Whether Brown decides to run or not, his dignity of work themes could serve as a playbook for Democrats in the heartland, said David Pepper, the chairman of the Ohio Democratic party, which will remain neutral in the primary. \u201cHe\u2019s a reminder to people that Ohio is winnable,\u201d Pepper said. \u201cAnd if we turn Ohio blue, that\u2019s the end of the Trump presidency. Brown was a champion of populist economic policies long before Trump captured Ohio \u2013 once the consummate battleground state \u2013 by eight percentage points in 2016. But he suddenly became a very serious contender in November, when the senator won re-election to a third term by six percentage points as every other major Democrat running statewide fell short. He declared that his victory was a \u201cblueprint for our nation in 2020\u201d. Over the next few weeks, Brown will road-test this theory, beginning in Iowa on Thursday. Joining him for the ride is his wife, Connie Schultz, a Pulitzer prize-winning columnist who spent many years writing for the Cleveland Plain Dealer daily newspaper. Schultz, introducing her husband to longtime supporters, told a story about the first time Brown met her father. She said her father, a \u201cproud member of Utility Workers Local 270\u201d, thought he already knew what he needed to know about Brown, who was at the time a US congressman. But once introduced, Brown peppered him with questions about his union benefits and his pension. Afterward, her father delivered his verdict: \u201cHe\u2019s us, in a tie.\u201d Brown has cultivated a \u201crumpled\u201d image, so much so that even a fresh haircut generated buzz about his presidential ambitions. (His wife offered an alternative: \u201cYou know, honey, you just don\u2019t have the schedule for regular haircuts. Let\u2019s ask Carlo to cut it short this Saturday.\u201d On the lapel of his suits \u2013 which, he is fond of reminding anyone in earshot, are made by union workers who live 10 miles from his home in Cleveland \u2013 he wears a canary pin, a symbol of what the coalminers used to carry with them into the mines to detect poisonous gas. That everyman appeal and longstanding links to organized labor and blue-collar workers have helped him rise high \u2013 and remain - in Ohio politics. He won his first race for state legislature months after he graduated from Yale, at just 22 years old. When the legislature was not in session, Brown spent his time in union halls, with the workers who would stand by him even as they steadily drifted from the Democratic party. Brown was elected to the House of Representatives in 1992, where he began to distinguish himself as one of the more liberal members of his party. On Wednesday, he touted as proof of his longstanding commitment to workers\u2019 rights and progressive causes his votes against Nafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, against what he called the \u201cwrongly named\u201d Defense of Marriage Act, which barred same-sex couples from marrying, in 1996 and against the Iraq war in 2002. \u201cToo often, people \u2013 Democratic activists and pundits \u2013 act like our party has to choose between advocating for strong progressive values that excite our base, which we do, or talking to working-class voters about their lives,\u201d he said on Wednesday, speaking at a warehouse in Brunswick. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s not either/or,\u201d he continued: \u201cWe will always do both.\u201d Should he run, Brown would jump into what will probably be a historically diverse primary field after a midterm season dominated by the success of Democratic women and candidates of color. He also enters as a virtual unknown to voters outside the state, especially by comparison with Senator Bernie Sanders and former vice-president Joe Biden, both of whom are mulling runs in 2020 and generate support among working-class voters. In Brunswick, Brown recalled Trump\u2019s promise to bring back manufacturing jobs. \u201cDon\u2019t move. Don\u2019t sell your house,\u201d Trump told people in Youngstown, Ohio, at a rally in 2017. Now General Motors is threatening to close its Lordstown plant and Trump, the senator said, is not going to bat for the workers who helped deliver him the presidency. \u201cNow that jobs are on the line,\u201d Brown said, \u201che\u2019s not lifting a finger.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A student called Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been invited to dinner by the dean of Harvard Law School, along with the eight other women in her year. Her wide-eyed eagerness is swiftly put in check when the dean asks each woman to stand up and say something about themselves, including \u201cwhy you\u2019re occupying a place that could have gone to a man\u201d.</p> <p>This is an early moment in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/09/ruth-bader-ginsburg-on-the-basis-of-sex-review\">On the Basis of Sex</a>, a biopic about Ginsburg, who eventually became a US Supreme Court justice. It\u2019s a scene that Mimi Leder, the film\u2019s director, could identify with well. In 1973, Leder became the first woman to graduate from the prestigious <a href=\"https://www.afi.com/conservatory/default.aspx\">American Film Institute Conservatory</a>: \u201cI never entered the world of film-making saying, \u2018I\u2019m entering a male-dominated business.\u2019 I entered the world of storytelling because I felt compelled to tell stories. But throughout my career, I\u2019ve been predominantly the only the woman in the room.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvBT-IO4lY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BgvBT-IO4lY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>On the Basis of Sex has been referred to as Ginsburg\u2019s \u201csuperhero origin story\u201d. With Leder, however, things were not so straightforward. This is her first movie for nearly 20 years. Like a great many female directors, she found herself prematurely and unfairly shut out of an overwhelmingly male-dominated Hollywood. But, like a great many female directors, she is now returning.</p> <p>Leder\u2019s career got off to a flying start. Having seen the dynamism she put into hospital drama game-changer ER, Steven Spielberg invited her to direct the first movie from his fledgling DreamWorks studio: 1997\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-peacemaker-1997\">The Peacemaker</a>, starring Nicole Kidman as a nuclear expert and George Clooney as the commando who has problems taking orders from a woman.</p> <p>Leder\u2019s next, <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/deep-impact-1998\">Deep Impact</a>, was a huge hit but its follow-up, the Kevin Spacey drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/jan/26/culture.reviews1\">Pay It Forward,</a> was not. The good scripts stopped coming and Leder began to realise she was in \u201cmovie jail\u201d \u2013 the place directors are sent to after a commercial flop. \u201cIt\u2019s hard coming back from that emotionally,\u201d says Leder. \u201cBut I never stopped directing. I directed nine pilots for television and six went on to become series.\u201d Leder\u2019s subsequent TV credits include The West Wing, Shameless, Luck and <a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/the-leftovers/season-01\">The Leftovers</a>, the HBO hit on which she was co-showrunner.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Movie jail can be a life sentence. You could fill a whole prison with women whose careers got off to a bright start, only to falter</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When it comes to movie jail, sentences are far lighter for men. It is hard to think of a male director who hasn\u2019t made a flop at some stage, then gone on to redeem themselves: David Fincher (Alien 3), Joss Whedon (Serenity), Richard Linklater (Fast Food Nation), Steven Soderbergh (Logan Lucky, Haywire), even the Coen brothers (Hail Caesar!). Some seem to have made an entire career out of failing upwards: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/zack-snyder\">Zack Snyder</a>\u2019s reward for such expensive flops as Legend of the Guardians and Sucker Punch was custodianship of Warner/DC\u2019s superhero franchise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"136020c1d83b353655b15d56f0f7e5e7d84d9e09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/136020c1d83b353655b15d56f0f7e5e7d84d9e09/0_314_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Director Karyn Kusama on the set of Girlfight.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the loose \u2026 Karyn Kusama, whose film Destroyer is on release.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Bridges/Screen Gems/NYT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For women, though, movie jail can be a life sentence. You could fill a whole prison wing with similar cases to Leder\u2019s, women whose careers got off to a bright start, only to somehow falter. But the prison breakout seems to be gaining momentum. Another escapee is on the loose right now: Karyn Kusama, who has returned with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/23/destroyer-review-nicole-kidman-karyn-kusama\">Destroyer</a>, starring Nicole Kidman as a ravaged, world-weary, antisocial detective. Destroyer is a superior Los Angeles thriller in the hard-boiled, neo-noir tradition, but Kidman\u2019s character is no gender-swapped male gumshoe: she carries the guilt of being a terrible mother, for one thing. And when was the last time Philip Marlowe had to give someone a hand job in exchange for information?</p> <p>Like Leder, Kusama is back after a long absence. She made a big impression with her 2000 debut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/apr/20/culture.reviews\">Girlfight</a> \u2013 another story of a woman in a man\u2019s world, starring then newcomer Michelle Rodriguez as a spirited Latina boxer. It won prizes at Sundance and Cannes, Variety hailed it as \u201cthe arrival of a major new talent\u201d, and Kusama was soon snapped up by Paramount for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/feb/17/3\">Aeon Flux</a>, a lavish sci-fi movie starring Charlize Theron.</p> <p>The experience was not a happy one. Paramount wanted something like The Matrix, while Kusama envisaged a sort of dystopian Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The film was taken out of her hands and edited into an incoherent, 71-minute mess. For extra humiliation, the studio then asked Kusama to return and edit its mess into something slightly less messy, which still bombed at the box office.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cba72f74020f32f06ada0add77967829a95c6970\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cba72f74020f32f06ada0add77967829a95c6970/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Back from the Twilight zone \u2026 (clockwise from top left) Kimberly Peirce, Lisa Cholodenko, Mimi Leder and Catherine Hardwicke.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Back from the Twilight zone \u2026 (clockwise from top left) Kimberly Peirce, Lisa Cholodenko, Mimi Leder and Catherine Hardwicke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Reuters/Alamy/Rex/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So Kusama found herself in movie jail, too. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s supposed to sound like a rite of passage,\u201d she said a few years ago, \u201cbut so few women get any opportunity to have more than just the rite of passage \u2013 which is a big part, I think, of what we really need to be talking about when it comes to women\u2019s careers in film.\u201d</p> <p>Kusama came back with 2009\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/06/jennifers-body-review\">Jennifer\u2019s Body</a> \u2013 a sharp, feminist teen horror penned by Diablo Cody, and another commercial flop (although it is currently undergoing a well-deserved critical reappraisal).

      "bodyText": "A student called Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been invited to dinner by the dean of Harvard Law School, along with the eight other women in her year. Her wide-eyed eagerness is swiftly put in check when the dean asks each woman to stand up and say something about themselves, including \u201cwhy you\u2019re occupying a place that could have gone to a man\u201d. This is an early moment in On the Basis of Sex, a biopic about Ginsburg, who eventually became a US Supreme Court justice. It\u2019s a scene that Mimi Leder, the film\u2019s director, could identify with well. In 1973, Leder became the first woman to graduate from the prestigious American Film Institute Conservatory: \u201cI never entered the world of film-making saying, \u2018I\u2019m entering a male-dominated business.\u2019 I entered the world of storytelling because I felt compelled to tell stories. But throughout my career, I\u2019ve been predominantly the only the woman in the room.\u201d On the Basis of Sex has been referred to as Ginsburg\u2019s \u201csuperhero origin story\u201d. With Leder, however, things were not so straightforward. This is her first movie for nearly 20 years. Like a great many female directors, she found herself prematurely and unfairly shut out of an overwhelmingly male-dominated Hollywood. But, like a great many female directors, she is now returning. Leder\u2019s career got off to a flying start. Having seen the dynamism she put into hospital drama game-changer ER, Steven Spielberg invited her to direct the first movie from his fledgling DreamWorks studio: 1997\u2019s The Peacemaker, starring Nicole Kidman as a nuclear expert and George Clooney as the commando who has problems taking orders from a woman. Leder\u2019s next, Deep Impact, was a huge hit but its follow-up, the Kevin Spacey drama Pay It Forward, was not. The good scripts stopped coming and Leder began to realise she was in \u201cmovie jail\u201d \u2013 the place directors are sent to after a commercial flop. \u201cIt\u2019s hard coming back from that emotionally,\u201d says Leder. \u201cBut I never stopped directing. I directed nine pilots for television and six went on to become series.\u201d Leder\u2019s subsequent TV credits include The West Wing, Shameless, Luck and The Leftovers, the HBO hit on which she was co-showrunner. When it comes to movie jail, sentences are far lighter for men. It is hard to think of a male director who hasn\u2019t made a flop at some stage, then gone on to redeem themselves: David Fincher (Alien 3), Joss Whedon (Serenity), Richard Linklater (Fast Food Nation), Steven Soderbergh (Logan Lucky, Haywire), even the Coen brothers (Hail Caesar!). Some seem to have made an entire career out of failing upwards: Zack Snyder\u2019s reward for such expensive flops as Legend of the Guardians and Sucker Punch was custodianship of Warner/DC\u2019s superhero franchise. For women, though, movie jail can be a life sentence. You could fill a whole prison wing with similar cases to Leder\u2019s, women whose careers got off to a bright start, only to somehow falter. But the prison breakout seems to be gaining momentum. Another escapee is on the loose right now: Karyn Kusama, who has returned with Destroyer, starring Nicole Kidman as a ravaged, world-weary, antisocial detective. Destroyer is a superior Los Angeles thriller in the hard-boiled, neo-noir tradition, but Kidman\u2019s character is no gender-swapped male gumshoe: she carries the guilt of being a terrible mother, for one thing. And when was the last time Philip Marlowe had to give someone a hand job in exchange for information? Like Leder, Kusama is back after a long absence. She made a big impression with her 2000 debut Girlfight \u2013 another story of a woman in a man\u2019s world, starring then newcomer Michelle Rodriguez as a spirited Latina boxer. It won prizes at Sundance and Cannes, Variety hailed it as \u201cthe arrival of a major new talent\u201d, and Kusama was soon snapped up by Paramount for Aeon Flux, a lavish sci-fi movie starring Charlize Theron. The experience was not a happy one. Paramount wanted something like The Matrix, while Kusama envisaged a sort of dystopian Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The film was taken out of her hands and edited into an incoherent, 71-minute mess. For extra humiliation, the studio then asked Kusama to return and edit its mess into something slightly less messy, which still bombed at the box office. So Kusama found herself in movie jail, too. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s supposed to sound like a rite of passage,\u201d she said a few years ago, \u201cbut so few women get any opportunity to have more than just the rite of passage \u2013 which is a big part, I think, of what we really need to be talking about when it comes to women\u2019s careers in film.\u201d Kusama came back with 2009\u2019s Jennifer\u2019s Body \u2013 a sharp, feminist teen horror penned by Diablo Cody, and another commercial flop (although it is currently undergoing a well-deserved critical reappraisal). Low-budget horror The Invitation helped restore her reputation. But since Girlfight, Kusama has directed just four movies this century. In the same timespan, Richard Linklater has made 14, Steven Soderbergh 21. According to the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, of the top 1,100 Hollywood films from 2007 to 2017, a mere 53 were directed by women. That\u2019s a lamentable 4%. And almost all of these women only made one movie (the exact figure is 84%, compared with 55% of men). When you tally up the women directors with similarly curtailed careers to Leder and Kusama\u2019s, it starts to look like a lost generation. Many made their names in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but spent the next two decades struggling in features or switching to TV. Patty Jenkins had a dream debut with 2003\u2019s Monster, the story of serial killer Aileen Wuornos. It won Charlize Theron many awards, including the best actress Oscar. Jenkins\u2019 reward? Fifteen years in film-development hell, supplemented by TV gigs. Kimberly Peirce directed Hilary Swank to an Oscar in 1999\u2019s Boys Don\u2019t Cry. It took nearly a decade until her follow-up, 2008\u2019s Iraq war drama Stop-Loss, followed by a remake of Carrie in 2013. Tamara Jenkins\u2019 semi-autobiographical Slums of Beverly Hills played at Cannes in 1998. Her follow-up came nearly a decade later: 2007\u2019s The Savages, which earned her a screenwriting Oscar nomination. Playing alongside Jenkins\u2019 film at Cannes that year was Lisa Cholodenko\u2019s High Art. Cholodenko has made just three films since, the last being 2010\u2019s The Kids Are All Right. It is not just about commercial failure, either. Catherine Hardwicke, who broke through with the Sundance-winning teen drama Thirteen, went on to direct the smash hit Twilight, which ought to have put Hollywood at her feet. But she was not invited back for the sequels. The good news is that almost all of these women are back behind the camera, making female-centred films. Patty Jenkins, of course, saved DC\u2019s comic-book universe (and undid Zack Snyder\u2019s damage) with Wonder Woman, the highest-grossing film ever directed by a woman. She\u2019s currently working on the sequel. Tamara Jenkins returned after a 10-year hiatus with last year\u2019s excellent fertility drama Private Life. Peirce is now working on This Is Jane, about the women who provided abortion services in 1970s America. Cholodenko is directing a remake of the hit German comedy Toni Erdmann. And Hardwicke has a Tijuana-set crime thriller, Miss Bala, coming out in March. All cause for celebration, but you wonder what we might have missed. Had these women been afforded the same latitude as their male counterparts, they could be established auteurs rather than occasional directors. Some women have built such careers, of course: Sofia Coppola, Kathryn Bigelow, Ava DuVernay.

Then again, this year\u2019s Academy award nominations demonstrate how far there is to go: Marielle Heller\u2019s Can You Ever Forgive Me? is the only film directed by a woman to figure in any of the main categories. Silverstein says it\u2019s about \u201cpeople with juice using it for good\u201d. Like those who have pledged to adopt an \u201cinclusion rider\u201d, requiring a certain proportion of staff on a project to be women, people of colour, LGBT people and people with disabilities.

Seventh Star (1986)</h2> \n<p>Seventh Star was meant to be Tony Iommi\u2019s first solo album, until label and management decided no one was going to buy it, and insisted it be billed as Black Sabbath, even if only Iommi was pictured on the cover.

The appearance of Ice-T on Illusion of Power \u2013 the album was produced by Ernie C of <a href=\"https://www.bodycountband.com/\" title=\"\">Body Count \u2013</a> signified a band who had lost their way as surely as a middle-aged executive buying a Harley-Davidson.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dee1ca5a30ae479bb3a32939c4163c1aa9e4bfd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dee1ca5a30ae479bb3a32939c4163c1aa9e4bfd/0_196_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Geoff Nicholls, Tony Iommi, Dave Spitz, Eric Singer and Glenn Hughes in 1985.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Geoff Nicholls, Tony Iommi, Dave Spitz, Eric Singer and Glenn Hughes in 1985.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Walter/WireImage</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>16. Tyr (1990)</h2> \n<p>The 15th Sabbath album doesn\u2019t sound much like Sabbath at all. The riffs are conventional mainstream metal: it would have sounded perfectly of its time five years earlier, but by 1990 \u2013 with Ozzy Osbourne-era Sabbath being exhumed by grunge and stoner bands \u2013 something more like the band of 20 years before might have hit home a lot harder.</p> \n<h2>15. The Eternal Idol (1987)</h2> \n<p>The first album with singer Tony Martin opened with an Iommi riff that offered hope of redemption: The Shining was more polished than, say, Wheels of Confusion, but it suggested Sabbath might<strong> </strong>be able to claw their way out of their hole. It often felt, though, as if the rest of the band were sanding down their leader\u2019s riffs to fit an 80s template.</p> \n<h2>14. Headless Cross (1989)</h2> \n<p>Some Sabbath loyalists make a case for Headless Cross being a neglected classic. They can make the case, but they\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s perfectly serviceable, but Martin was an identikit metal singer: he sings about Satan with all the menace of someone offering cheese samples at Morrisons deli counter.</p> \n<h2>13. Technical Ecstasy (1976)</h2> \n<p>Butler claimed Technical Ecstasy was Sabbath responding to punk. Given it was recorded in June 1976, that suggests they were either way ahead of the curve, or that Butler is mistaken. Back Street Kids may back his claim, but most of the rest of Technical Ecstasy was a mess.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c9fa719eb8a9f6b6da9e374379d3290a398b6162\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9fa719eb8a9f6b6da9e374379d3290a398b6162/0_28_2400_3000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ozzy performing in New York in 1982.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ozzy performing in New York in 1982.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Marano/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>12. Cross Purposes (1994)</h2> \n<p>For the first time in more than decade, Sabbath sounded like a contemporary metal band, rather than a group trying to sound like a contemporary metal band (and on Cardinal Sin, Iommi and Butler gave Martin the kind of preposterously epic setting that Dio had deserved). It\u2019s no Master of Reality, but it was the best Sabbath album since the early 80s.</p> \n<h2>11. Born Again (1983)</h2> \n<p>According to Sabbath mythology, Born Again should have been smothered at birth. Actually, it\u2019s pretty good: Ian Gillan, whose only recordings with the band these were, still had his voice, and the other three are pretty focused. Of course, Gillan\u2019s lyrics were awful and very un-Sabbath, but it was the best record he had been involved in since his time in Deep Purple.</p> \n<h2>10. Never Say Die (1978)</h2> \n<p>The final album of the original Ozzy era has a terrible reputation, but it\u2019s a quirky and enjoyable record, as long as you don\u2019t expect Sabbath Even Bloodier Sabbath. The title track has garage-band rawness; Air Dance is \u2013 dare one say it \u2013 oddly beautiful. It\u2019s hit and miss, but it\u2019s still better than almost everything from 1981 onwards.</p> \n<h2>9. 13 (2013)</h2> \n<p>The original foursome reconvened for the first time since 1978 \u2013 and for the first record by any Sabbath lineup since 1995 \u2013 under the guidance of producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rick-rubin\" title=\"\">Rick Rubin</a>, who fairly evidently told them there was only one thing people wanted Black Sabbath to do: sound like Black Sabbath. It didn\u2019t scale the original heights, but 13 was miles better than anyone dared expect.</p> \n<h2>8. Mob Rules (1981)</h2> \n<p>After the success of Heaven and Hell (1980), Sabbath essentially made the same album again, just not quite as well. But what could have been a productive 80s was derailed by rows about the mix (Iommi accused Dio of sneaking back to the studio at night to turn his vocals up) and by Dio\u2019s departure.</p> \n<h2>7. Black Sabbath (1970)</h2> \n<p>A tolling bell, the sound of pouring rain, then the riff that changed everything: Black Sabbath invented an entire worldview within the first 60 seconds of their debut. You can still hear the blues-rock band they had been \u2013 The Wizard; Evil Woman, Don\u2019t Play Your Games With Me; an interminable cover of Aynsley Dunbar\u2019s Warning \u2013 which makes it an album of greater promise than reality.</p> \n<h2>6. Sabotage (1975)</h2> \n<p>The last of the run of great albums (the fact you can see drummer Bill Ward\u2019s underpants through his wife\u2019s red tights on the cover is a handy metaphor for a band that was about to lose its grip), and still fantastic. Symptom of the Universe barrels along, before reaching a fabulous acoustic section \u2013 it is an album full of invention. And Osbourne, rarely an expressive singer, was at his best here.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s7_WbiR79E\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5s7_WbiR79E?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Iron Man.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>5. Paranoid (1970)</h2> \n<p>The title track! Iron Man! Rhyming \u201cmasses\u201d with \u201cmasses\u201d on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQUXuQ6Zd9w\" title=\"\">War Pigs</a>! The second Sabbath album was a leap into a different dimension from their debut: a huge, grim, monolithic edifice that brooked no doubt. You didn\u2019t think it was OK; you thought it was the greatest thing ever. Or you hated it. For many years, virtually every critic fell into the second camp. The fools.</p> \n<h2>4. Vol 4 (1972)</h2> \n<p>The sleeve thanks \u201cthe great COKE-Cola Company of Los Angeles\u201d, and you can hear it: Vol 4 is a powder-blown record, blank and unrelenting, grinding its teeth. Wheels of Confusion reduces the idea of the riff to its bare minimum. Snowblind \u2013 originally intended to be the title track \u2013 captures the essence of Vol 4. All your nihilist needs met in one place.</p> \n<h2>3. Heaven and Hell (1980)</h2> \n<p>The opener, Neon Knights, served notice that Black Sabbath \u2013 with Dio replacing Osbourne \u2013 were revitalised. It wasn\u2019t the only track on which the group sounded rejuvenated by the emergent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/sep/07/the-new-wave-of-british-heavy-metal-10-of-the-best\" title=\"\">new wave of British of heavy metal</a> (see also: Die Young). The title track still had the Sabbath plod, yet they somehow sounded nimble with it. They were leading again, not following.</p> \n<h2>2. Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973)</h2> \n<p>The fifth Sabbath album saw them stretching out \u2013 Looking for Today has a flute break! A flute! On a Black Sabbath record! \u2013 but without sacrificing intensity. From the cover \u2013 some sort of satanic ritual in bed \u2013 through the title track, to Killing Yourself to Live, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath helped codify metal and extend its boundaries.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"023ed7d259c20359a77ea40d5a7f82153274ed87\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/023ed7d259c20359a77ea40d5a7f82153274ed87/0_84_3275_1965/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Geezer Butler, Tony Iommi, Bill Ward and Ozzy Osbourne in the 70s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Geezer Butler, Tony Iommi, Bill Ward and Ozzy Osbourne in the 70s.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Walter/WireImage</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>1. Master of Reality (1971)</h2> \n<p>Master of Reality was Black Sabbath\u2019s most subtle album yet and their most bludgeoning. Ward\u2019s jazzy drumming \u2013 somehow swinging and precise \u2013 propelled even the most straightforward of the tracks. (Children of the Grave would be a pretty good boogie without Ward; he makes it monstrous.) The previous album was called Paranoid, but this was the one that sounded paranoid. The cause was perhaps the subject of the album\u2019s opener, Sweet Leaf, on which a looped cough gives way to an Iommi riff so brutal that it is almost a caricature, before Osbourne spends several minutes explaining just how much he likes weed. A masterpiece.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"166615a1-ed30-43e9-9201-083a41ce7713\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Actors</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/07/actors-playing-nightmarish-versions-of-themselves-in-cinema-ranked-keeanu-reeves\">Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema -

      "bodyText": "19. Seventh Star (1986) Seventh Star was meant to be Tony Iommi\u2019s first solo album, until label and management decided no one was going to buy it, and insisted it be billed as Black Sabbath, even if only Iommi was pictured on the cover. That it isn\u2019t really Sabbath is apparent from the power ballad No Stranger to Love. Power ballad? Sabbath? Madness. 18. Dehumaniser (1992) Dehumaniser? Well, it certainly makes you feel like letting go of your humanity. The return of Geezer Butler and Ronnie James Dio should have been a good thing, but the band forgot to write any good songs to take advantage of the optimism. Letters from Earth has a good Iommi riff, but the rest is subpar. 17. Forbidden (1995) What long looked likely to be the final Black Sabbath album would have been a sad little footnote to their career. The appearance of Ice-T on Illusion of Power \u2013 the album was produced by Ernie C of Body Count \u2013 signified a band who had lost their way as surely as a middle-aged executive buying a Harley-Davidson. 16. Tyr (1990) The 15th Sabbath album doesn\u2019t sound much like Sabbath at all. The riffs are conventional mainstream metal: it would have sounded perfectly of its time five years earlier, but by 1990 \u2013 with Ozzy Osbourne-era Sabbath being exhumed by grunge and stoner bands \u2013 something more like the band of 20 years before might have hit home a lot harder. 15. The Eternal Idol (1987) The first album with singer Tony Martin opened with an Iommi riff that offered hope of redemption: The Shining was more polished than, say, Wheels of Confusion, but it suggested Sabbath might be able to claw their way out of their hole. It often felt, though, as if the rest of the band were sanding down their leader\u2019s riffs to fit an 80s template. 14. Headless Cross (1989) Some Sabbath loyalists make a case for Headless Cross being a neglected classic. They can make the case, but they\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s perfectly serviceable, but Martin was an identikit metal singer: he sings about Satan with all the menace of someone offering cheese samples at Morrisons deli counter. 13. Technical Ecstasy (1976) Butler claimed Technical Ecstasy was Sabbath responding to punk. Given it was recorded in June 1976, that suggests they were either way ahead of the curve, or that Butler is mistaken. Back Street Kids may back his claim, but most of the rest of Technical Ecstasy was a mess. 12. Cross Purposes (1994) For the first time in more than decade, Sabbath sounded like a contemporary metal band, rather than a group trying to sound like a contemporary metal band (and on Cardinal Sin, Iommi and Butler gave Martin the kind of preposterously epic setting that Dio had deserved). It\u2019s no Master of Reality, but it was the best Sabbath album since the early 80s. 11. Born Again (1983) According to Sabbath mythology, Born Again should have been smothered at birth. Actually, it\u2019s pretty good: Ian Gillan, whose only recordings with the band these were, still had his voice, and the other three are pretty focused. Of course, Gillan\u2019s lyrics were awful and very un-Sabbath, but it was the best record he had been involved in since his time in Deep Purple. 10. Never Say Die (1978) The final album of the original Ozzy era has a terrible reputation, but it\u2019s a quirky and enjoyable record, as long as you don\u2019t expect Sabbath Even Bloodier Sabbath. The title track has garage-band rawness; Air Dance is \u2013 dare one say it \u2013 oddly beautiful. It\u2019s hit and miss, but it\u2019s still better than almost everything from 1981 onwards. 9. 13 (2013) The original foursome reconvened for the first time since 1978 \u2013 and for the first record by any Sabbath lineup since 1995 \u2013 under the guidance of producer Rick Rubin, who fairly evidently told them there was only one thing people wanted Black Sabbath to do: sound like Black Sabbath. It didn\u2019t scale the original heights, but 13 was miles better than anyone dared expect. 8. Mob Rules (1981) After the success of Heaven and Hell (1980), Sabbath essentially made the same album again, just not quite as well. But what could have been a productive 80s was derailed by rows about the mix (Iommi accused Dio of sneaking back to the studio at night to turn his vocals up) and by Dio\u2019s departure. 7. Black Sabbath (1970) A tolling bell, the sound of pouring rain, then the riff that changed everything: Black Sabbath invented an entire worldview within the first 60 seconds of their debut. You can still hear the blues-rock band they had been \u2013 The Wizard; Evil Woman, Don\u2019t Play Your Games With Me; an interminable cover of Aynsley Dunbar\u2019s Warning \u2013 which makes it an album of greater promise than reality. 6. Sabotage (1975) The last of the run of great albums (the fact you can see drummer Bill Ward\u2019s underpants through his wife\u2019s red tights on the cover is a handy metaphor for a band that was about to lose its grip), and still fantastic. Symptom of the Universe barrels along, before reaching a fabulous acoustic section \u2013 it is an album full of invention. And Osbourne, rarely an expressive singer, was at his best here. 5. Paranoid (1970) The title track! Iron Man! Rhyming \u201cmasses\u201d with \u201cmasses\u201d on War Pigs! The second Sabbath album was a leap into a different dimension from their debut: a huge, grim, monolithic edifice that brooked no doubt. You didn\u2019t think it was OK; you thought it was the greatest thing ever. Or you hated it. For many years, virtually every critic fell into the second camp. The fools. 4. Vol 4 (1972) The sleeve thanks \u201cthe great COKE-Cola Company of Los Angeles\u201d, and you can hear it: Vol 4 is a powder-blown record, blank and unrelenting, grinding its teeth. Wheels of Confusion reduces the idea of the riff to its bare minimum. Snowblind \u2013 originally intended to be the title track \u2013 captures the essence of Vol 4. All your nihilist needs met in one place. 3. Heaven and Hell (1980) The opener, Neon Knights, served notice that Black Sabbath \u2013 with Dio replacing Osbourne \u2013 were revitalised. It wasn\u2019t the only track on which the group sounded rejuvenated by the emergent new wave of British of heavy metal (see also: Die Young). The title track still had the Sabbath plod, yet they somehow sounded nimble with it. They were leading again, not following. 2. Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973) The fifth Sabbath album saw them stretching out \u2013 Looking for Today has a flute break! A flute! On a Black Sabbath record! \u2013 but without sacrificing intensity. From the cover \u2013 some sort of satanic ritual in bed \u2013 through the title track, to Killing Yourself to Live, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath helped codify metal and extend its boundaries. 1. Master of Reality (1971) Master of Reality was Black Sabbath\u2019s most subtle album yet and their most bludgeoning. Ward\u2019s jazzy drumming \u2013 somehow swinging and precise \u2013 propelled even the most straightforward of the tracks. (Children of the Grave would be a pretty good boogie without Ward; he makes it monstrous.) The previous album was called Paranoid, but this was the one that sounded paranoid. The cause was perhaps the subject of the album\u2019s opener, Sweet Leaf, on which a looped cough gives way to an Iommi riff so brutal that it is almost a caricature, before Osbourne spends several minutes explaining just how much he likes weed. A masterpiece.",

The court of appeal ruled Asda\u2019s lower-paid store staff, who are mainly female, can compare themselves to higher-paid warehouse workers, who are mainly male, in pay claims. Lawyers representing tens of thousands of store staff hailed the ruling as \u201ca major step forward in the fair pay battle on behalf of tens of thousands of store workers\u201d. Walmart-owned Asda had already lost attempts to block the claims at the employment tribunal and employment appeal tribunal, but had appealed. The supermarket will apply to the supreme court for permission to appeal. Handing down Thursday\u2019s judgment, which followed a three-day hearing in October, Lord Justice Underhill ruled that for both retail workers and distribution workers \u201cAsda applied common terms and conditions wherever they worked\u201d. The workers, represented by the law firm Leigh Day through the website Equalpaynow.co.uk, have argued they should be paid the same as their colleagues in the supermarket\u2019s distribution centres for their work of equal value. Leigh Day claims to represent more than 30,000 shopfloor staff from the big four supermarkets \u2013 Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Morrisons \u2013 in similar pay cases. The total payout, if the supermarkets lose, could be more than \u00a38bn, said Leigh Day. The \u00a38bn estimate is based on all 500,000 store workers across the big four supermarkets who are making a claim, it added. The largest number of claimants is against Tesco, with the Tesco Action Group made up of present and former employees represented by Equal Pay Action through the law firm Harcus Sinclair. Thursday\u2019s victory, which established that the roles are comparable, is the first step in proving the shopworkers\u2019 claims. The staff must now prove the roles are of equal value, and if so whether there is a reason other than sex discrimination that means the roles should not be paid equally. The Asda case is the furthest along of all the supermarket equal pay claims. Linda Wong from Leigh Day said: \u201cOur clients are obviously delighted to have won this major victory against Asda and we now hope that rather than continuing to spend huge sums of money thwarting attempts to pay their staff what they are worth, Asda and the other major supermarkets will pay their staff fairly as these workers are also their customers and fair wages benefit all businesses and UK society in general.\u201d Asda said it was \u201cobviously disappointed\u201d with the ruling, which dealt with a \u201cpreliminary issue\u201d in the legal battle. It said it remained confident in its case as it continued in the employment tribunal.

Results have confirmed that the three cases of Staphylococcus aureus are linked and our investigations continue into how they are linked.\u201d Dr Alan Mathers, chief of medicine, women\u2019s and children\u2019s service for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said an incident management team meeting was convened last Thursday. \u201cThe IMT began their investigations into possible linkages between the three cases and sent samples for testing. Whilst these results were awaited, we spoke to the families affected, together with the parents on the unit and staff, to let them know of our investigations. The results that have come back have confirmed links between the three cases,\u201d he said. \u201cOur infection control team continues to work closely with clinical colleagues and domestic staff to manage the situation and take all necessary steps to maintain patient safety.\u201d The Scottish Liberal Democrats\u2019 health spokesperson, Alex Cole-Hamilton, said the past few weeks had highlighted \u201csignificant vulnerabilities\u201d in the Scottish healthcare system. He said: \u201cThis is a desperately sad situation and my heart goes out to the families affected. As soon as she is in possession of all the facts, the health secretary should appear before parliament to offer reassurances to patients that these outbreaks are being addressed and that where necessary procedures will change to prevent any further tragedy of this kind.\u201d Asked about the neonatal deaths at first minister\u2019s questions in the Holyrood chamber on Thursday, Nicola Sturgeon passed on her condolences to the families of the babies who died, and insisted that the health board was \u201ctaking all necessary steps to maintain patient safety\u201d, including regular screening of newborn children and enhanced cleaning. She added that the board has asked Health Protection Scotland to carry out an investigation, but added that the Staphylococcus aureus bacterium linked to the deaths is \u201cregrettably not uncommon\u201d.",

This slow-release opioid was vigorously promoted to doctors and, amid lax regulation and slick sales tactics, people were assured it was safe. But the drug was akin to luxury morphine, doled out like super aspirin, and highly addictive. What resulted was a commercial triumph and a public health tragedy.

      "bodyText": "Drug company executives appearing in court in Boston this week have been accused of running \u201ca criminal enterprise\u201d and putting greed before patient safety as they pushed prescription narcotics during the opioids crisis, blighting the health of America. The defendants are the first painkiller manufacturing bosses to stand trial over conduct authorities say contributed to an overdose epidemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of people in the past 20 years, regardless of region, age, race and income. If the Boston trial and others scheduled to get under way later this year are anything to go by, 2019 is now shaping up as the start of a reckoning for the pharmaceutical giants still making billions from opioids. Assistant US attorney David Lazarus told jurors in the federal court in Boston that John Kapoor and the company he created, Insys Therapeutics, ran a nationwide kickback and conspiracy scheme that effectively bribed doctors to routinely prescribe patients an addictive fentanyl spray that was much powerful than morphine and had been approved to alleviate the pain of advanced cancer. Kapoor and four of his colleagues deny the criminal charges against them. \u201cThis is a case about greed and the consequences of putting profits over people,\u201d Lazarus said in his opening statement on Monday, adding that Arizona-based Insys also defrauded insurers into paying for the narcotic nasal spray Subsys, which contains fentanyl. Kapoor was arrested in 2017 on the same day Donald Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency. In 2017, a record 47,600 people died of opioid-related overdoses, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fentanyl is the synthetic opioid that killed Prince. Former Insys senior executives Michael Babich and Alec Burlakoff have already pleaded guilty and are helping prosecutors. Insys paid $150m to resolve a federal investigation into the marketing of Subsys. Lazarus said one defendant, Sunrise Lee \u2013 a sales executive and ex-stripper \u2013 gave a lap dance to an Illinois doctor to persuade him to prescribe Subsys to patients it wasn\u2019t suitable for. As the trial continues, a new reality of so-called big pharma bosses facing the consequences over opioid deaths and addiction appears to be just beginning to play out as other legal battles loom. In May, Oklahoma is due to be the first state to go to trial out of more than 40suing Purdue Pharma, the manufacturer of Oxycontin, the most well-known prescription opioid, and several other companies, claiming they hid the addictive nature of their products and how easy they were to abuse. And in October, three bellwether trials will get under way in a huge multi-district litigation case before a federal court in Cleveland, that has brought together more than 1,200 lawsuits from county and city governments across the nation. \u201cThe opioids crisis is the biggest public health problem that we have in this country and it\u2019s outrageous that it\u2019s gone on this long \u2026 I see it as very significant that now we as a society are holding people accountable,\u201d said Angela Mattie, a professor in the school of business and the school of medicine at Quinnipiac University. Robert Bird, professor of business law at the University of Connecticut, said the balance of power has shifted away from big pharma to the public. \u201cOver the next year, a day of reckoning is possible,\u201d he said. A judge in Oklahoma ruled last summer that cameras can be brought into the courtroom when the trial against pharmaceutical companies Purdue Pharma, Allergan, Janssen, Teva and subsidiary companies begins on 28 May. Mike Hunter, the state attorney general, said the transparency would \u201callow individuals to see how these companies maliciously deceived the nation while creating the deadliest manmade epidemic in United States history\u201d. The companies deny wrongdoing. On Friday, further explosive details are due to be made public in a civil case brought against Purdue by the Massachusetts attorney general, Maura Healey. Massachusetts is one of a small number of plaintiffs in the avalanche of litigation against Purdue that has amended its original complaint specifically to add the names of individual members of the Sackler family, who wholly own Purdue Pharma, to the list of defendants. Earlier this month, newly unveiled court filings in Healey\u2019s case revealed that when OxyContin was created in the mid-1990s, family member Richard Sackler, who was then a senior executive at Purdue, told people gathered at the painkiller\u2019s launch party that the event would be \u201cfollowed by a blizzard of prescriptions that will bury the competition\u201d. Portions of the complaint remained redacted, but on Monday the judge in the case ruled that almost all of it must be revealed by noon on Friday in court in Boston \u2013 moments away from where Kapoor and the Insys executives are now on trial. Suffolk county in Long Island, New York, has also sued Sackler family members personally. \u201cWe are beginning, through various documents, to learn what the Sackler family knew and when they knew it and that they continued to do business,\u201d said Mattie. There are signs that a huge settlement could be on the horizon but, meanwhile, plaintiffs are forging ahead towards trial. Joe Rice is co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs in the multi-district litigation (MDL) in Cleveland, a city suffering from the overdose epidemic. \u201cThe MDL has been extensively involved in developing documentary and deposition evidence against all the defendants and that includes Purdue and, by necessity, information about the Sackler family while they were directors of the company, and much of that has been shared with the attorneys general [in the state cases], including Massachusetts,\u201d Rice said on Tuesday. The Sackler family is worth around $13bn. The dynasty is known for philanthropy to cultural and academic institutions in the US and the UK, but the controversy is affecting that profile. Leading institutions say little about the ethics of accepting donations, but the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York broke ranks and is reviewing its policy, as first reported by the conservative news website the Daily Caller. Spokesman Ken Weine said: \u201cWe are watching this topic with great interest, and, in light of the recent developments, carefully reviewing our overall policies in this area.\u201d In 2007, executives at Purdue Pharma pleaded guilty in criminal court that they had misled regulators, doctors and patients about the drug\u2019s risk of addiction and its potential to be abused.

      "body": "<p>Ariana Grande\u2019s song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYh6mYIJG2Y\" title=\"\">7 Rings</a> was released less than two weeks ago. In that time, it has already reached No 1 in 18 countries and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicamercuri/2019/01/29/the-7-records-ariana-grande-has-already-broken-with-7-rings/#7d238f72651e\" title=\"\">broken Spotify\u2019s record</a> for most streams in a 24-hour period. So, obviously, Grande celebrated this achievement in the traditional manner; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/31/ariana-grande-mocked-for-japanese-tattoo-typo-leave-me-and-my-grill-alone\" title=\"\">getting the Japanese for \u201csmall charcoal grill\u201d tattooed on her hand</a>.</p> <p>The slip-up has already become infamous. Grande apparently wanted \u201c7 Rings\u201d tattooed on her in kanji. However, the tattoo she got actually reads \u201cshichirin\u201d; a lightweight portable charcoal stove that is used in Japan to grill fish or meat.</p> <p>It is embarrassing, but at least it allows Grande to enter the prestigious and sacred Celebrity Botched Tattoo Translation Hall of Fame. Here are her peers.</p> <h2><strong>David Beckham</strong><br></h2> <p>In 2000, David Beckham wanted to get a tattoo in honour of his wife. However, he also wanted it in Hindi, a language he doesn\u2019t speak. Which is why, when translated, his tattoo reads \u201cVihctoria\u201d. Sadly, however, a \u201cVihctoria\u201d isn\u2019t a small charcoal grill, so Grande\u2019s tattoo is still funnier.</p> <h2><strong>Jessie J</strong><br></h2> <p>Jessie J once wrote a song called Who You Are, which contained the lyric \u201cDon\u2019t lose who you are in the blur of the stars\u201d. To mark this, she had the words \u201cDon\u2019t loose who you are in the blur of the stars\u201d tattooed on her pelvis. This is also why Jessie J favours high-waisted trousers these days.</p> <h2><strong>Britney Spears</strong><br></h2> <p>Grande needs to go some to beat Spears, for she has two misspelled tattoos. On her hip is a Chinese symbol that was intended to read \u201crebellious\u201d but says \u201cstrange\u201d. And on the back of her neck, there used to be three Hebrew characters. They were meant to spell \u201cGod\u201d, in an act of devotion to Kabbalah, but they were inked out of order so were just gibberish.</p> <h2><strong>Rihanna</strong><br></h2> <p>The phrase \u201crebel flower\u201d is important to Rihanna.

      "bodyText": "Ariana Grande\u2019s song 7 Rings was released less than two weeks ago. In that time, it has already reached No 1 in 18 countries and broken Spotify\u2019s record for most streams in a 24-hour period. So, obviously, Grande celebrated this achievement in the traditional manner; getting the Japanese for \u201csmall charcoal grill\u201d tattooed on her hand. The slip-up has already become infamous. Grande apparently wanted \u201c7 Rings\u201d tattooed on her in kanji. However, the tattoo she got actually reads \u201cshichirin\u201d; a lightweight portable charcoal stove that is used in Japan to grill fish or meat. It is embarrassing, but at least it allows Grande to enter the prestigious and sacred Celebrity Botched Tattoo Translation Hall of Fame. Here are her peers. David Beckham In 2000, David Beckham wanted to get a tattoo in honour of his wife. However, he also wanted it in Hindi, a language he doesn\u2019t speak. Which is why, when translated, his tattoo reads \u201cVihctoria\u201d. Sadly, however, a \u201cVihctoria\u201d isn\u2019t a small charcoal grill, so Grande\u2019s tattoo is still funnier. Jessie J Jessie J once wrote a song called Who You Are, which contained the lyric \u201cDon\u2019t lose who you are in the blur of the stars\u201d. To mark this, she had the words \u201cDon\u2019t loose who you are in the blur of the stars\u201d tattooed on her pelvis. This is also why Jessie J favours high-waisted trousers these days. Britney Spears Grande needs to go some to beat Spears, for she has two misspelled tattoos. On her hip is a Chinese symbol that was intended to read \u201crebellious\u201d but says \u201cstrange\u201d. And on the back of her neck, there used to be three Hebrew characters. They were meant to spell \u201cGod\u201d, in an act of devotion to Kabbalah, but they were inked out of order so were just gibberish. Rihanna The phrase \u201crebel flower\u201d is important to Rihanna. It is how she describes herself, it is the name of a perfume she launched in 2010 and it is the title of an unauthorised biography that someone once wrote about her. It is also why she has the words \u201cRebelle Fleur\u201d tattooed on her neck, even though French adjectives typically follow the nouns they modify, so it is ultimately meaningless. Hayden Panettiere Finally, the ruler of the Celebrity Botched Tattoo Translation Hall of Fame. Actor Panettiere has \u201cLive Without Regrets\u201d tattooed on her side in Italian. Except it is spelled incorrectly. This is a level that Grande can only aspire to reach. Maybe next time.",

      "body": "<p>Sheltering from a sudden downpour in a parked car just off Brixton Road, London, are two of British music\u2019s greatest new talents, and now biggest outlaws: <a href=\"https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/vbqpzb/skengdo-and-am-interview-and-what-a-feeling-video\">Skengdo and AM</a>. A fortnight ago, the Metropolitan police announced they had secured a sentence of nine months in prison for the two 21-year-old drill rappers, suspended for two years, for breaching a gang injunction issued in August last year.</p> <p>The nature of the breach? Performing their song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jol5AnURRek\">Attempted 1.0</a> at a London concert in early December. The suppression of <a href=\"https://www.dummymag.com/features/behind-bars-uk-banning-music-censor-drill-alarming-new-ground/\">black music in the UK stretches back 100 years</a>, but, according to <a href=\"https://www.indexoncensorship.org/what-we-do/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA1sriBRD-ARIsABYdwwHXkwcJt0wnKe34lAvmr1er2KghX507oUgOrERQyPZfsf_g9x7umnoaAl8EEALw_wcB\">Index on Censorship</a>, this is the first time in British legal history that a prison sentence has been issued for performing a song.</p> <p>The concert, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/11/skengdo-x-am-review-koko-london\">at 1,400-capacity Koko</a>, was the culmination of a sold-out nationwide tour, a celebratory homecoming gig performed in front of a diverse crowd of moshing fans. \u201cWe ended the year on such a positive note, we were so proud of what we\u2019d achieved,\u201d says AM. \u201cWe were just really excited about 2019.\u201d Skengdo rolls his eyes. \u201cAnd what a fucking start to this year. I just feel violated.\u201d</p> <p>The backlash is already gathering pace: a forthcoming open letter signed by civil rights group <a href=\"https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/\">Liberty</a> and others calls the injunction \u201ca threat to all our civil liberties\u201d, that prevents young people from discussing \u201cthe reality of their lives with any hope of being heard.\u201d</p> <p>Jodie Ginsberg, CEO of Index on Censorship, points to the long history of the authorities targeting music by people \u201cfar removed from those in power \u2026 The law already prevents individuals from directly inciting violence, but such wide-ranging bans go well beyond this. They are not the way to handle ideas or opinions that are distasteful or disturbing, and do nothing to address the issues that lead to the creation of this kind of music.\u201d</p> <p>Skengdo and AM\u2019s suspended jail sentence marks a dramatic watershed in the young life of the controversial UK drill scene. The rap subgenre was born <a href=\"https://www.factmag.com/2017/04/27/uk-drill-chicago-brixton/\">on the south side of Chicago in the early 2010s</a>, built from monotone beats and glinting synths, usually with bleak, charismatically delivered lyrics. It has flourished since being discovered on YouTube by young rappers on the same London council estates that previously produced grime, and \u201croad rap\u201d crossover stars such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/05/giggs-when-will-it-stop\">Giggs</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kreptandkonan?lang=en\">Krept and Konan</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5cb430ba1ba3221f6fa80d0b20fba845b817f2c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cb430ba1ba3221f6fa80d0b20fba845b817f2c7/0_0_3840_5760/667.jpg\" alt=\"Skengdo x AM playing at Koko, north London.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Skengdo x AM playing at Koko, north London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Drill was still underground at the end of 2017, but an unholy brew of violent lyrics and music videos, rising incidences of youth violence and media fondness for a pop culture scapegoat led to negative headlines in 2018. It would be naive to deny that there are connections between drill music and real-world violence: lyrics have been cited in several court cases, and the drill MC M-Trap was among those convicted of the murder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/15/three-jailed-stabbing-teenager-south-london-jermaine-goupall\">15-year-old Jermaine Goupall in August 2017</a>. As with moral panics over 90s gangster rap and 00s UK garage, \u201cvideo nasties\u201d, violent Hollywood films and computer games, the controversy concerns the muddy waters between cause and correlation.</p> <p>The song that landed AM and Skengdo \u2013 plus TS and Blackz, two fellow members of their Brixton-based group <a href=\"https://www.factmag.com/2017/04/27/uk-drill-chicago-brixton/\">410</a> \u2013 their unprecedented sentence is a dark, disarmingly catchy tune that was one of the best rap tracks of 2018. It features AM\u2019s trademark deep flow describing alleged historic violent clashes with several members of rival crews <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/moscow17-rapper-killed-triple-stabbing-london-incognito-mc-camberwell-2362496\">Moscow17 </a>and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/spartansharlem?lang=en\">Harlem Spartans</a>, both based barely a mile away to the north. AM taunts their members by name and sketches out cartoonish gang violence: \u201cMy big .45, it came with fries / I keep her close, my Valentine / Her range ain\u2019t shit, it\u2019s kinda wide / So if you lack you\u2019re gonna die.\u201d Three young men from these crews <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/07/man-charged-murder-drill-rapper-sidique-kamara-london\">were killed</a> in the space of a few months in 2018, but there is no suggestion \u2013 from the police or anyone else \u2013 that members of 410 were involved.</p> <p>The Met nevertheless decided to classify 410 as a gang, with the injunction declaring that 410\u2019s activities, \u201cincluding but not limited to the production of drill music videos \u2026 have amounted to gang-related violence\u201d. In a culture in which rival groups often call each other out on YouTube and Snapchat, the diss track was seen by the Met as unforgivably incendiary. The injunction will remain in place until January 2021, and prohibits the named 410 members from entering the SE11 postcode, 10 minutes\u2019 walk from their homes. The Met had pushed for a ban on them entering SE1, too, which spans the South Bank area of the Thames, but the judge rejected this request.</p> <p>The injunction also prohibits Skengdo and AM performing or broadcasting songs with lyrics mentioning those rival crews, rappers in those crews or even describing \u201cintrusions on to any other gang or group\u2019s perceived territory\u201d, including their postcodes.</p> <p>The Met\u2019s claim is that in performing Attempted 1.0 at Koko, and sharing clips of the gig on social media, Skengdo and AM \u201cincited and encouraged violence against rival gang members\u201d, in breach of the injunction. The rappers\u2019 management team point out that incitement to violence is a crime in itself, for which no charge has been brought \u2013 and that neither of the rappers has ever been convicted of a violent crime.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/30/drill-music-violent-videos-youtube-youth-violence\">Yes, drill music is violent.

They have imposed something that will give us a criminal record just for making music. We didn\u2019t contest the injunction, and the breach, because we couldn\u2019t afford it \u2013 we were forced into a corner, where we had to choose between our careers and freedom.

The police were waiting for any opportunity to say: \u2018You guys are in breach.\u2019 But there\u2019s just no evidence that censorship is actually going to stop any crime. It\u2019s a very, very weak argument.\u201d</p> <p>If it\u2019s not going to stop crime, then why are the police doing it? \u201cIt\u2019s PR for them,\u201d says AM. \u201cIf you\u2019ve never been to this area, and you know there\u2019s a crime problem because you read about it, it makes the police look like they\u2019re doing something.\u201d</p> <p>This case follows that of west London drill crew 1011, who in June last year, were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/22/the-war-against-rap-censoring-drill-may-seem-radical-but-its-not-new\">handed a three-year criminal behaviour order</a> (the successor to the asbo) banning them from mentioning rival crews in their music. On that occasion, the order was tacked on to a criminal conviction and sentence for carrying weapons they claimed were props for use in a video. As the human rights lawyer Elena Papamichael warned at the time, the next step could be censorship of artists who had not been charged, let alone convicted, of any crime.

      "bodyText": "Sheltering from a sudden downpour in a parked car just off Brixton Road, London, are two of British music\u2019s greatest new talents, and now biggest outlaws: Skengdo and AM. A fortnight ago, the Metropolitan police announced they had secured a sentence of nine months in prison for the two 21-year-old drill rappers, suspended for two years, for breaching a gang injunction issued in August last year. The nature of the breach? Performing their song Attempted 1.0 at a London concert in early December. The suppression of black music in the UK stretches back 100 years, but, according to Index on Censorship, this is the first time in British legal history that a prison sentence has been issued for performing a song. The concert, at 1,400-capacity Koko, was the culmination of a sold-out nationwide tour, a celebratory homecoming gig performed in front of a diverse crowd of moshing fans. \u201cWe ended the year on such a positive note, we were so proud of what we\u2019d achieved,\u201d says AM. \u201cWe were just really excited about 2019.\u201d Skengdo rolls his eyes. \u201cAnd what a fucking start to this year. I just feel violated.\u201d The backlash is already gathering pace: a forthcoming open letter signed by civil rights group Liberty and others calls the injunction \u201ca threat to all our civil liberties\u201d, that prevents young people from discussing \u201cthe reality of their lives with any hope of being heard.\u201d Jodie Ginsberg, CEO of Index on Censorship, points to the long history of the authorities targeting music by people \u201cfar removed from those in power \u2026 The law already prevents individuals from directly inciting violence, but such wide-ranging bans go well beyond this. They are not the way to handle ideas or opinions that are distasteful or disturbing, and do nothing to address the issues that lead to the creation of this kind of music.\u201d Skengdo and AM\u2019s suspended jail sentence marks a dramatic watershed in the young life of the controversial UK drill scene. The rap subgenre was born on the south side of Chicago in the early 2010s, built from monotone beats and glinting synths, usually with bleak, charismatically delivered lyrics. It has flourished since being discovered on YouTube by young rappers on the same London council estates that previously produced grime, and \u201croad rap\u201d crossover stars such as Giggs and Krept and Konan. Drill was still underground at the end of 2017, but an unholy brew of violent lyrics and music videos, rising incidences of youth violence and media fondness for a pop culture scapegoat led to negative headlines in 2018. It would be naive to deny that there are connections between drill music and real-world violence: lyrics have been cited in several court cases, and the drill MC M-Trap was among those convicted of the murder of 15-year-old Jermaine Goupall in August 2017. As with moral panics over 90s gangster rap and 00s UK garage, \u201cvideo nasties\u201d, violent Hollywood films and computer games, the controversy concerns the muddy waters between cause and correlation. The song that landed AM and Skengdo \u2013 plus TS and Blackz, two fellow members of their Brixton-based group 410 \u2013 their unprecedented sentence is a dark, disarmingly catchy tune that was one of the best rap tracks of 2018. It features AM\u2019s trademark deep flow describing alleged historic violent clashes with several members of rival crews Moscow17 and Harlem Spartans, both based barely a mile away to the north. AM taunts their members by name and sketches out cartoonish gang violence: \u201cMy big .45, it came with fries / I keep her close, my Valentine / Her range ain\u2019t shit, it\u2019s kinda wide / So if you lack you\u2019re gonna die.\u201d Three young men from these crews were killed in the space of a few months in 2018, but there is no suggestion \u2013 from the police or anyone else \u2013 that members of 410 were involved. The Met nevertheless decided to classify 410 as a gang, with the injunction declaring that 410\u2019s activities, \u201cincluding but not limited to the production of drill music videos \u2026 have amounted to gang-related violence\u201d. In a culture in which rival groups often call each other out on YouTube and Snapchat, the diss track was seen by the Met as unforgivably incendiary. The injunction will remain in place until January 2021, and prohibits the named 410 members from entering the SE11 postcode, 10 minutes\u2019 walk from their homes. The Met had pushed for a ban on them entering SE1, too, which spans the South Bank area of the Thames, but the judge rejected this request. The injunction also prohibits Skengdo and AM performing or broadcasting songs with lyrics mentioning those rival crews, rappers in those crews or even describing \u201cintrusions on to any other gang or group\u2019s perceived territory\u201d, including their postcodes. The Met\u2019s claim is that in performing Attempted 1.0 at Koko, and sharing clips of the gig on social media, Skengdo and AM \u201cincited and encouraged violence against rival gang members\u201d, in breach of the injunction. The rappers\u2019 management team point out that incitement to violence is a crime in itself, for which no charge has been brought \u2013 and that neither of the rappers has ever been convicted of a violent crime. Their mood is a mixture of disbelief and defiance, along with reflection on how they arrived at this point. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of power, ultimately,\u201d AM says. \u201cI feel like the authorities have taken advantage of that. They have imposed something that will give us a criminal record just for making music. We didn\u2019t contest the injunction, and the breach, because we couldn\u2019t afford it \u2013 we were forced into a corner, where we had to choose between our careers and freedom. And the only way we could choose our career is by pleading guilty and trying to move on with making music. \u201cOur defence is that it\u2019s not malicious, the song is already out and it\u2019s a tour \u2013 people are expecting it, of course we\u2019re going to perform Attempted. The police were waiting for any opportunity to say: \u2018You guys are in breach.\u2019 But there\u2019s just no evidence that censorship is actually going to stop any crime. It\u2019s a very, very weak argument.\u201d If it\u2019s not going to stop crime, then why are the police doing it? \u201cIt\u2019s PR for them,\u201d says AM. \u201cIf you\u2019ve never been to this area, and you know there\u2019s a crime problem because you read about it, it makes the police look like they\u2019re doing something.\u201d This case follows that of west London drill crew 1011, who in June last year, were handed a three-year criminal behaviour order (the successor to the asbo) banning them from mentioning rival crews in their music. On that occasion, the order was tacked on to a criminal conviction and sentence for carrying weapons they claimed were props for use in a video. As the human rights lawyer Elena Papamichael warned at the time, the next step could be censorship of artists who had not been charged, let alone convicted, of any crime. Indeed, as well as Skengdo and AM, there are yet more London-based rappers \u2013 who want to remain anonymous \u2013 who have been served with similar gang injunctions by the Met, explicitly specifying individuals, crews and postcodes they cannot rap about. During the tabloid brouhaha over drill and violent crime last summer, the police launched a high-profile media campaign, with the Met chief, Cressida Dick, blaming drill for fuelling the rise in violence, and announcing they had persuaded YouTube to remove 30 music videos. Det Supt Mike West says that the force had been looking at the connection between online videos and gang violence since 2015 and has developed a central database with more than 1,600 indexed videos used to gather intelligence. \u201cThe speed at which an online disagreement can escalate into violence, often very serious violence, is staggering,\u201d West says. \u201cMusic role models and social media have a hugely powerful and positive impact, but when used in the wrong way the consequences can quite literally be deadly.\u201d As of 30 November 2018, the Met has secured the removal of 90 such videos from the platform. \u201cWe are not seeking to suppress freedom of expression through any kind of music,\u201d West says. \u201cWe only ask for videos to be removed from social media which we believe raise the risk of violence.\u201d The artists take a different view. \u201cThe video censorship doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d says Skengdo. \u201cAs soon as it goes down, fans will put it back up.\u201d The official video for the offending Skengdo and AM track was removed from YouTube at the Met\u2019s request last July \u2013 but the track is still easily available to listen to on the website. What of the violent content of Attempted 1.0, in which the rappers recount alleged stabbings and provocatively taunt rivals? \u201cYoung kids spend all night playing Fortnite, playing GTA, where you\u2019re actively making your character shoot over and over,\u201d says AM. \u201cWe\u2019re just talking about violent things that have happened. It\u2019s clear to see which one is worse.\u201d In fact, the lurid tales of violence in Attempted 1.0, designed to humiliate 410\u2019s musical rivals, are arguably in the long tradition of diss tracks. The BBC Radio 1Xtra DJ Kenny Allstar says drill originally came about \u201cbased on what people in the under-represented sector were going through and about showcasing stories that people in the mainstream world wouldn\u2019t understand. If you look back to earlier times like the punk era, young people who were being backed down decided to rise up and speak their mind.\u201d But the police interference has undoubtedly had an impact on the scene\u2019s lyrics. \u201cA lot of rappers are censoring their music now,\u201d says Skengdo. \u201cEven down to what they name their video, or what hashtag they use to promote it.

We have to change the way we do things to accommodate the police, which is ridiculous.

You have to find an alternative.\u201d He smiles. \u201cFortunately, we\u2019re smart guys.\u201d Drill is now rapidly evolving, partly as a result of this pressure.

      "body": "<p>Italy\u2019s far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has mocked new rules aimed at combating racism in football.</p> <p>The Italian football federation (FIGC) said on Wednesday that players would be told to leave the pitch if two warnings over the public address failed to stop racist chanting during matches.</p> <p>The move came after Kalidou Koulibaly, a Napoli player who was born in France to Senegalese parents, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/26/carlo-ancelotti-slams-racist-chanting-napoli-kalidou-koulibaly\">subjected to monkey chants</a> during a game against Inter Milan on Boxing Day.

      "bodyText": "Italy\u2019s far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has mocked new rules aimed at combating racism in football. The Italian football federation (FIGC) said on Wednesday that players would be told to leave the pitch if two warnings over the public address failed to stop racist chanting during matches. The move came after Kalidou Koulibaly, a Napoli player who was born in France to Senegalese parents, was subjected to monkey chants during a game against Inter Milan on Boxing Day. Three appeals were made over the PA system to stop the chants but the abuse continued throughout the match. Under the new guidelines, matches will be paused after the first warning and players will converge in the middle of the pitch. Upon a second warning, players will return to the changing rooms and a security official will then decide whether to call off the game. The FIGC\u2019s president, Gabriele Gravina, said the move \u201csimplified procedures by removing responsibility from the referee\u201d. Procedures previously required the referee to briefly stop a match if racist chants were heard and to request a public announcement asking fans to stop. But Salvini disparaged the move, saying: \u201cNow we have a Richter scale for booing. Come on, don\u2019t make us laugh.\u201d The FIGC also said on Wednesday it was investigating claims that a referee racially abused a Senegalese goalkeeper, Gueye Ass Dia, during a non-league game between Serino and Real Sarno. Serino players walked off in protest against the alleged abuse of their teammate. In January, after a meeting of government and FIGC officials to address racism and violence at football matches, Salvini, an ardent AC Milan supporter, said he was against suspending games for racist chanting, arguing that it was a \u201cslippery slope\u201d. But he pledged to root out violence after an Inter Milan fan died after clashes with Napoli supporters outside Milan\u2019s San Siro stadium before the Boxing Day game. Roberto Coramusi, the head of institutional relations at FIGC, told the Guardian the federation would not comment on Salvini\u2019s latest remarks, but he said: \u201cWe act on behalf of our convictions but also our competencies.

Transport for the North (TfN) announced the proposals, which they say will result in 1.3 million people living within an hour\u2019s train journey from Manchester airport and at least four major northern cities.

However the 28-year-old admits that giving up the chance to play sevens in the Tokyo Olympics next year was not an easy one, even allowing for her Jonny Wilkinson moment. \u201cNo it wasn\u2019t easy. I would have loved to have gone to Tokyo but sevens is a game for young players and I\u2019m in the twilight of my career and this is a great opportunity. \u201cContracts have made a real difference to the girls who were having to fit in training sessions between work. It\u2019s much easier to prepare for matches like this now and we have time to recover from matches. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy in Dublin. They\u2019ve got players like Lauren Delany and Claire Molloy, who are playing with us in the Tyrrells league. We\u2019ve got some good memories from winning a grand slam there two years ago but we\u2019re expecting a tough evening. Yes, everyone is talking about the France game as being the key fixture in the Six Nations but we won\u2019t be underestimating Ireland.\u201d Simon Middleton, England\u2019s head coach, knows the weather conditions are likely to be testing. \u201cIt could turn out to be a forward battle but we have a pack to cope with that,\u201d he said. \u201cIreland are a good side. They\u2019re better than the result in November suggested. They were a bit unlucky really, losing a couple of key players early on. But we\u2019ve got some world\u2011class players like Emily returning from the 2017 World Cup, as well as some newer names who\u2019ve impressed through the season.\u201d Poppy Cleall is in England\u2019s second row with her twin sister, the prop Bryony, poised to win her first cap from the bench. An illustration of Middleton\u2019s strength in depth is that the wing Lydia Thompson, who scored a hat-trick against Ireland two months ago \u2013 three of 21 tries England scored in three internationals in November \u2013 does not make the cut. Ireland\u2019s head coach, Adam Griggs, knows England will be favourites. \u201cThere\u2019s no bigger challenge than to open against the side that are second in the world,\u201d he said. Ireland have a strong back row, which includes the Wasps openside Molloy and the captain and No 8, Ciara Griffin. England will also be wary of the threat of the dangerous Munster right-wing Eimear Considine, who scored a brilliant try against them in the autumn. France begin their title defence against Wales on Saturday evening in Montpellier, while Scotland take on Italy at Scotstoun on Friday night. France, who travel to Doncaster to face England in the second round, are missing their injured world player of the year, Jessy Tremouliere, as well as a number of players who are on sevens duty.",

What you think of Encore\u2019s very existence depends on whether you believe the soul and spirit of the Specials rests with Dammers, or with Terry Hall, the lead vocalist on almost every one of their hits: a parlour game that can keep ageing rude boys and girls arguing for hours, never getting any less depressing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/2K7Z8kR4tsXDIkS0jWLkwZ\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2K7Z8kR4tsXDIkS0jWLkwZ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>Under the circumstances, the obvious thing for Hall, guitarist Lynval Golding and bassist Horace Panter to do would be to release an album in the image of the music that made the Specials\u2019 famous: see, it wasn\u2019t all Jerry, we can do it without him. If Encore scrupulously avoids the frantic ska-punk sound of their 1979 debut, there are certainly moments that feel like deliberate evocations of the band\u2019s past. With its mournful trombone solo and tension-ratcheting pile-up of queasy jazz chords, single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNeM3w5SVOs\">Vote for Me</a> is hardly coy in its attempts to get the listener to think of Ghost Town. A version of the Valentines\u2019 1967 single Blam Blam Fever \u2013 already covered by the ersatz Specials on the largely forgotten 2000 album Skinhead Girl \u2013 is the kind of dive into the ska archives that formed the basis of the band\u2019s early repertoire. You can understand the logic behind adding The Lunatics Have Taken Over the Asylum (the debut single by Hall and Golding\u2019s post-Specials band the Fun Boy Three) to their repertoire, but it feels strangely restrained and polite recast as a kind of dub tango.

      "body": "<p>Back in the day when rugby was amateur but toying with professionalism, Wales and Ireland could usually be found scrapping for the Five Nations wooden spoon, claiming it eight times between them in the 1990s. Had there been world rankings, neither would have been on the first page. They were two countries known for their emotion rather than attention to detail, moments of brilliance only occasionally compensating for structural disrepair.</p> <p>Then along came two New Zealanders to lay a new foundation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/30/six-nations-tougher-win-rugby-world-cup-robert-kitson\">Six Nations could be tougher to win this year than the Rugby World Cup | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Graham Henry took over Wales in 1998, they conceded 96 points to South Africa \u2013 it would have been a century but for a late dropped pass \u2013 having shipped 60 to England and 51 to France earlier in the year. But soon they went on their best winning run for 90 years.</p> <p>When Warren Gatland took charge of Ireland during the 1998 Five Nations, Ireland were on their way to a third successive wooden spoon. In 2000, the first year of the Six Nations, they finished third, their highest placing for 13 years, and were runners-up the following year, an achievement that earned him the sack.</p> <p>Henry did not last much longer with Wales, worn down by his experience with the 2001 Lions in South Africa when some Welsh players who felt they had not been given a chance to challenge for a place in the Test side rebelled and he found on his return that his authority had been eroded.</p> <p>Gatland and Henry started a process of profound change that has culminated in Ireland and Wales now standing at second and third in the world rankings, respectively. Gatland has been in charge of Wales since the end of 2007 while another New Zealander, Joe Schmidt, has been Ireland coach since 2013. Two teams who a generation before were scraping along the bottom have now won the Six Nations eight times between them.</p> <p>With New Zealand leading the world rankings, the top three countries have a Kiwi in charge. The fourth-placed side, England, are coached by an Australian, Eddie Jones, but in the autumn he recruited a former All Blacks coach, John Mitchell, to help add discipline and a sense of direction to his side after a run of five defeats in six Tests.</p> <p>If Wales and Ireland win their opening matches this weekend, there is every chance they will meet in Cardiff in the last round with the title at stake. It would be a fitting final Six Nations weekend for both Gatland and Schmidt, who are moving on after the World Cup. France away and England at home were fixtures the two countries used to go long periods without winning, but now they are both favourites to start with wins in their respective fixtures.</p> <p>Gatland and Schmidt have been successful because while they have both brought a New Zealand approach to their teams \u2013 one based on the premise that success only comes with hard work and meticulous preparation \u2013 they have not coached as they would in New Zealand, recognising that skill levels there are the highest in the world. Instead they have focused on the possible, stripping away emotion and bringing consistency where there was volatility.</p> <p>Gatland\u2019s first coaching job in Ireland was with Galwegians in the early 1990s when he still played for Waikato. His first match in charge was in Sligo, a two-hour trip, and with less than three hours to go to kick-off, the players were still in the clubhouse. Gatland ordered everyone to get on the bus and with one player in the toilet and two still to turn up, ordered the driver to get going. A few miles from the ground, he asked the driver to pull over, told the players to get out, making them run behind the coach and only letting them back on after a mile.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ea2275a7702547a83f86c9f616e8b8749b6fded\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ea2275a7702547a83f86c9f616e8b8749b6fded/0_28_5048_3029/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ireland\u2019s victory over the All Blacks in Dublin last November showed they are Rugby World Cup contenders.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ireland\u2019s victory over the All Blacks in Dublin last November showed they are Rugby World Cup contenders.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Carr/Inpho/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He had shown them who was boss and within a few weeks, Galwegians started a 13-match winning run. When Schmidt took his first training session with Leinster, he bawled out Brian O\u2019Driscoll, making the point early that there was no one bigger than he was and that he would treat the players equally.</p> <p>The two coaches, in different ways, exude authority and that is reflected in the disciplined way their sides play.</p> <p>Wales, the land of Barry John, Gerald Davies and Phil Bennett, is still a nation where romanticism lurks, and there have been rumblings about the style of play under Gatland. But the trade-off has been close-fought contests against the best teams in the world, the salvaging of respect and the team\u2019s most successful period since the 1970s. This has been achieved against a backdrop of a struggle for Wales\u2019s four regions in Europe and the loss of players to clubs in England and France. Schmidt only selects players based in Ireland and most of them play for two of the European game\u2019s powerhouses, Leinster and Munster.</p> <p>Wales had started to decline in the 1980s after the glory of the decade before and their 1988 tour to New Zealand showed why. Wales\u2019s training sessions often bordered on the casual with banter flying around and they could stretch on aimlessly. There was a closeness between coaches and players but in the All Blacks camp there was a distance.</p> <p>Before the first Test in Christchurch, the All Blacks trained early in the morning at a school.

      "bodyText": "Back in the day when rugby was amateur but toying with professionalism, Wales and Ireland could usually be found scrapping for the Five Nations wooden spoon, claiming it eight times between them in the 1990s. Had there been world rankings, neither would have been on the first page. They were two countries known for their emotion rather than attention to detail, moments of brilliance only occasionally compensating for structural disrepair. Then along came two New Zealanders to lay a new foundation. When Graham Henry took over Wales in 1998, they conceded 96 points to South Africa \u2013 it would have been a century but for a late dropped pass \u2013 having shipped 60 to England and 51 to France earlier in the year. But soon they went on their best winning run for 90 years. When Warren Gatland took charge of Ireland during the 1998 Five Nations, Ireland were on their way to a third successive wooden spoon. In 2000, the first year of the Six Nations, they finished third, their highest placing for 13 years, and were runners-up the following year, an achievement that earned him the sack. Henry did not last much longer with Wales, worn down by his experience with the 2001 Lions in South Africa when some Welsh players who felt they had not been given a chance to challenge for a place in the Test side rebelled and he found on his return that his authority had been eroded. Gatland and Henry started a process of profound change that has culminated in Ireland and Wales now standing at second and third in the world rankings, respectively. Gatland has been in charge of Wales since the end of 2007 while another New Zealander, Joe Schmidt, has been Ireland coach since 2013. Two teams who a generation before were scraping along the bottom have now won the Six Nations eight times between them. With New Zealand leading the world rankings, the top three countries have a Kiwi in charge. The fourth-placed side, England, are coached by an Australian, Eddie Jones, but in the autumn he recruited a former All Blacks coach, John Mitchell, to help add discipline and a sense of direction to his side after a run of five defeats in six Tests. If Wales and Ireland win their opening matches this weekend, there is every chance they will meet in Cardiff in the last round with the title at stake. It would be a fitting final Six Nations weekend for both Gatland and Schmidt, who are moving on after the World Cup. France away and England at home were fixtures the two countries used to go long periods without winning, but now they are both favourites to start with wins in their respective fixtures. Gatland and Schmidt have been successful because while they have both brought a New Zealand approach to their teams \u2013 one based on the premise that success only comes with hard work and meticulous preparation \u2013 they have not coached as they would in New Zealand, recognising that skill levels there are the highest in the world. Instead they have focused on the possible, stripping away emotion and bringing consistency where there was volatility. Gatland\u2019s first coaching job in Ireland was with Galwegians in the early 1990s when he still played for Waikato. His first match in charge was in Sligo, a two-hour trip, and with less than three hours to go to kick-off, the players were still in the clubhouse. Gatland ordered everyone to get on the bus and with one player in the toilet and two still to turn up, ordered the driver to get going. A few miles from the ground, he asked the driver to pull over, told the players to get out, making them run behind the coach and only letting them back on after a mile. He had shown them who was boss and within a few weeks, Galwegians started a 13-match winning run. When Schmidt took his first training session with Leinster, he bawled out Brian O\u2019Driscoll, making the point early that there was no one bigger than he was and that he would treat the players equally. The two coaches, in different ways, exude authority and that is reflected in the disciplined way their sides play. Wales, the land of Barry John, Gerald Davies and Phil Bennett, is still a nation where romanticism lurks, and there have been rumblings about the style of play under Gatland. But the trade-off has been close-fought contests against the best teams in the world, the salvaging of respect and the team\u2019s most successful period since the 1970s. This has been achieved against a backdrop of a struggle for Wales\u2019s four regions in Europe and the loss of players to clubs in England and France. Schmidt only selects players based in Ireland and most of them play for two of the European game\u2019s powerhouses, Leinster and Munster. Wales had started to decline in the 1980s after the glory of the decade before and their 1988 tour to New Zealand showed why. Wales\u2019s training sessions often bordered on the casual with banter flying around and they could stretch on aimlessly. There was a closeness between coaches and players but in the All Blacks camp there was a distance. Before the first Test in Christchurch, the All Blacks trained early in the morning at a school. The grass was still snow-white with frost and they had a scrummaging session, eight forwards against a machine with the head coach Alex Wyllie standing watching with a whistle stashed between his lips. Steam rose into the air as if someone had lit a bonfire and it was like that for 20 intense minutes. Barely a word was spoken. Both teams played as they trained that series and the result was two 50-pointers for the All Blacks. That is how Ireland and Wales train now, no longer boats against the current borne ceaselessly back into the past; red and green coated in honest black. \u2022 This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

Arctic winds lead to school closures and cancelled flights At least eight deaths have been linked to the polar vortex sweeping across the US midwest this week, including a Milwaukee man who froze to death in a garage, and a University of Iowa student whose body was found behind an academic hall early on Wednesday morning. Schools have closed in several cities including Chicago \u2013 AKA \u201cChiberia\u201d \u2013 where Wednesday\u2019s low of about -23F (-30C) was close to the record set in January 1985, raising concerns for the welfare of the city\u2019s homeless population. Flights cancelled. At least 4,500 flights have been cancelled due to cold weather, while the US Postal Service halted deliveries in some areas. America\u2019s Icebox. Adam Gabbatt travelled to the nation\u2019s coldest town in northern Minnesota to experience life at -58F. Facebook posts record profits despite string of scandals Facebook has posted a record profit for the fourth quarter of 2018, after a year in which the social media giant was buffeted by multiple scandals \u2013 including its role in foreign influence operations. The company\u2019s user numbers have also continued to increase, with year-on-year growth of 9% in daily active users and monthly active users, despite widespread fears over the misuse of private data. Markets surged in response to the news, with Microsoft also reporting positive earnings. Apple v Facebook? Apple has revoked Facebook\u2019s ability to publish certain apps after it was revealed the social network paid users as young as 13 to install an iPhone app that gave it access to information on their internet usage. How the religious right took hold in Trump\u2019s White House Karen Pence plans to teach at a Virginia school that bans homosexuality. Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, recently told an anti-abortion event that his was \u201cthe department of life, from conception until natural death\u201d.

Contract workers left without back-pay after shutdown Hundreds of thousands of US government contractors have returned to work after the longest-ever US government shutdown, but unlike federal employees, they do not expect to receive back wages for the 35 days of work they missed. The financial fallout for those workers, and for small businesses who rely on federal government contracts, is likely to be painful and long-lasting, reports Jamiles Lartey. Most vulnerable. Black-owned businesses hold a disproportionate number of contracts with the federal government, making them especially vulnerable to a shutdown. Crib sheet More than 1,000 files of evidence gathered by the Mueller investigation, and shared confidentially with lawyers for indicted Russian hackers, was obtained by Russians and leaked online last year, prosecutors said in a Wednesday court filing. John Kapoor, the founder of Insys Therapeutics Inc, will appear in court in Boston this week, in the first trial of a painkiller manufacturer over conduct that allegedly contributed to the opioids crisis. Kapoor and four of his colleagues deny the criminal charges against them. New York City\u2019s MTA is facing renewed calls for more elevators in subway stations, though the death of a young mother who fell down stairs at a Manhattan station last week is now thought to have been related to a pre-existing medical condition. The anti-vaccine movement is once again under the spotlight after the governor of Washington declared a public health emergency over a measles outbreak in the state.

His truck did not have a hands-free facility.</p> <p>The judge Rhys Rowlands said: \u201cThis was an accident which could have easily been prevented and your contribution to that accident is significant in as much as you were distracted, the distraction being as a result of you using your mobile phone before the actual collision.</p> <p>\u201cAny accident which results in someone losing their life is the most appalling tragedy, the more so when the deceased, as here, was well loved and a pretty remarkable woman.\u201d </p> <p>The court heard that Carol Boardman, who was wearing a helmet and bright clothing, fell from her bicycle on to the road and was run over by Rosney.</p> <p>Matthew Curtis, prosecuting, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear he was speaking to his wife on the telephone four seconds before the fatal collision and he was, we submit, still distracted by the telephone call and mobile telephone handset.\u201d</p> <p>One witness, Kayleigh Anders, said Rosney did not seem to realise that he had struck someone.</p> <p>\u201cAs he was driving she saw him looking down on to his lap.

      "bodyText": "A driver who fatally ran over the mother of the Olympic cyclist Chris Boardman has been jailed for 30 weeks. Liam Rosney, 33, admitted last month causing the death of Carol Boardman by careless driving in July 2016. On Thursday he was sentenced at Mold crown court and disqualified from driving for 18 and a half months. Carol Boardman, 75, whose son Chris won gold at the 1992 Olympics, sustained multiple injuries when she was hit by Rosney\u2019s Mitsubishi pickup truck after falling from her bike on a mini-roundabout in Connah\u2019s Quay, north Wales, on 16 July 2016. The court heard that Rosney took three calls on his mobile phone, which was on speaker, before the crash. His truck did not have a hands-free facility. The judge Rhys Rowlands said: \u201cThis was an accident which could have easily been prevented and your contribution to that accident is significant in as much as you were distracted, the distraction being as a result of you using your mobile phone before the actual collision. \u201cAny accident which results in someone losing their life is the most appalling tragedy, the more so when the deceased, as here, was well loved and a pretty remarkable woman.\u201d The court heard that Carol Boardman, who was wearing a helmet and bright clothing, fell from her bicycle on to the road and was run over by Rosney. Matthew Curtis, prosecuting, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear he was speaking to his wife on the telephone four seconds before the fatal collision and he was, we submit, still distracted by the telephone call and mobile telephone handset.\u201d One witness, Kayleigh Anders, said Rosney did not seem to realise that he had struck someone. \u201cAs he was driving she saw him looking down on to his lap. He only had one hand on the steering wheel and she formed the impression that he was paying attention to a mobile phone although she did not see one,\u201d Curtis said. \u201cImmediately after the collision she heard him say: \u2018Oh my God I have hit her. She came from nowhere.\u2019\u201d Oliver Jarvis, defending, said Rosney, a joiner from Connah\u2019s Quay, did not \u201cwant to make any excuses for his behaviour\u201d. He told the court: \u201cHe says that he has destroyed the lives of two families and therefore nothing I say will seek to undermine that guilty plea.\u201d Jarvis noted that Rosney previously had a clean licence and was driving at an appropriate speed at the time of the crash. Speaking before the sentencing, Boardman described the death as \u201chorrifically life-changing\u201d and called for longer bans to deter motorists from breaking the law. He also paid tribute to his mother, herself a talented cyclist, as the person who had inspired his passion for cycling and competition. \u201cSomebody who takes me swimming in the sea as a kid and races me \u2026 on a bike and has grandchildren is just taken away because somebody\u2019s careless, because they used a mobile phone. Our legal system thinks that\u2019s OK, and it\u2019s wrong,\u201d Boardman said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty certain that the death of my mother, which has been horrifically life-changing among all of our family, won\u2019t be enough to change that.\u201d Boardman said his mother\u2019s death had blighted a number of lives. \u201cMy dad\u2019s lost his partner of 50 years, and watching him has been heartbreaking.

The Belgian dance-theatre company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/09/peeping-tom-barbican-london-mime-festival-mother-father\">Peeping Tom</a> follow up their hit show <a href=\"https://mimelondon.com/peeping-tom-mother-2018/\">Mother</a> with the second work in a family-themed trilogy. Fathers may be the focus, but really this seems like a show about ageing, the confusion and indignity of losing your agency and your concrete grasp on the world. Before us is a desolate hall with dim lights and trestle tables. It slowly dawns that we\u2019re in an old people\u2019s home, albeit one where nice middle-aged ladies play drums in jazz bands and a woman\u2019s head pops out of a saucepan of soup.</p> <p>This oddball company\u2019s work is made of visual jokes, rubber-bodied dance and an eerie not-quite-normality that is all entertainingly surreal. The sense of shifting reality suits this theme \u2013 the questioning of memory, the slipping of the self \u2013 and family dynamics, as ever, make rich material for the stage. Father picks up the frustrations of relationships where tempers are quick to rise (\u201cYou always ask the same questions!\u201d), and the tenderness, exasperation and impatience of dealing with elderly parents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"09ab3cb378996d697e119af2a3d47ea234f57cf8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09ab3cb378996d697e119af2a3d47ea234f57cf8/0_565_4087_2163/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leo De Beul and Maria Carolina Vieira in Father.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"529\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Life and soul \u2026 Leo De Beul and Maria Carolina Vieira in Father.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are some silly gags \u2013 a bit of slapstick with a telescopic broom steals the show \u2013 but also brief moments that are truly harrowing: one man can\u2019t remember his daughter\u2019s name; another is browbeaten and treated like a child. Other scenes are heartening. When a wizened, lank-haired man leaves an audience of elderly ladies swooning as he takes to the piano for a wobbly voiced chorus of Feelings, we\u2019re reminded that older people are not a problem to be solved or pitied, but people with personalities, pasts and inner lives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/09/peeping-tom-barbican-london-mime-festival-mother-father\">'Bodies can go further than you think': Peeping Tom's bamboozling shows about parenthood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The older members of the cast are joined by five younger dancers, whose bodies stretch and ping in elastic-limbed contortions, taking tiny actions, like battling away an insect or putting on a shoe, and expanding them into frantic numbers.

      "bodyText": "Last year they tackled mums, now attention turns to dad. The Belgian dance-theatre company Peeping Tom follow up their hit show Mother with the second work in a family-themed trilogy. Fathers may be the focus, but really this seems like a show about ageing, the confusion and indignity of losing your agency and your concrete grasp on the world. Before us is a desolate hall with dim lights and trestle tables. It slowly dawns that we\u2019re in an old people\u2019s home, albeit one where nice middle-aged ladies play drums in jazz bands and a woman\u2019s head pops out of a saucepan of soup. This oddball company\u2019s work is made of visual jokes, rubber-bodied dance and an eerie not-quite-normality that is all entertainingly surreal. The sense of shifting reality suits this theme \u2013 the questioning of memory, the slipping of the self \u2013 and family dynamics, as ever, make rich material for the stage. Father picks up the frustrations of relationships where tempers are quick to rise (\u201cYou always ask the same questions!\u201d), and the tenderness, exasperation and impatience of dealing with elderly parents. There are some silly gags \u2013 a bit of slapstick with a telescopic broom steals the show \u2013 but also brief moments that are truly harrowing: one man can\u2019t remember his daughter\u2019s name; another is browbeaten and treated like a child. Other scenes are heartening. When a wizened, lank-haired man leaves an audience of elderly ladies swooning as he takes to the piano for a wobbly voiced chorus of Feelings, we\u2019re reminded that older people are not a problem to be solved or pitied, but people with personalities, pasts and inner lives. The older members of the cast are joined by five younger dancers, whose bodies stretch and ping in elastic-limbed contortions, taking tiny actions, like battling away an insect or putting on a shoe, and expanding them into frantic numbers. There\u2019s a question mark over what some of this dance adds, other than their bodies enhancing a sense of pliable reality, but Father is confident in the creation of its world, distinctive in its voice and poignant in its subject matter. At the Barbican, London, until 2 February. The London international mime festival runs until 3 February.",

Longliners target tuna and other species, but their fishing lines \u2013 which can be up to 80 miles long \u2013 also unintentionally trap, drown and harm seabirds, as well as turtles, dolphins and other marine life, a process known as \u201cbycatch\u201d.

It is understood that Uber Eats, taxi-hailing firm Uber\u2019s food delivery service, has paid in the region of \u00a35m to sponsor the hit show. This is more than double the estimated \u00a32.25m previous sponsor Superdrug paid for the record-setting last series. Superdrug found the proposed \u00a33.5m opening price set by ITV of sponsoring a fourth series of the Mallorca-set reality TV show too much but serious bids from nine advertisers keen to take it on drove the value to \u00a35m. Love Island airs on ITV2 and this is the most money paid for a TV sponsorship for a single programme not run on a flagship channel such as the main ITV and Channel 4 stations. ITV has secured the same sum Channel 4 squeezed out of Amazon UK to sponsor The Great British Bake Off, its biggest ratings winner, poached from the BBC for \u00a375m over three years and aired on its flagship channel. Since launching in 2016, Uber Eats has become a popular food delivery service among the millennial generation attracted to smartphone-led services such as Uber and its British delivery rival Deliveroo. The last series of Love Island was the biggest hit of the year among hard-to-reach 16- to 34-year-olds \u2013 with the exception of England\u2019s World Cup football matches \u2013 a huge draw for advertisers. The series, won by Dani Dyer and Jack Fincham, proved to be TV gold, smashing viewing records and providing the nation\u2019s watercooler moments over the summer. It was the most popular series ever aired on ITV2 \u2013 viewing figures at times topped 5 million \u2013 and showed that Britain\u2019s TV industry can still make programmes that appeal to younger audiences amid the streaming revolution. Uber Eats\u2019 deal marks an escalation of the delivery wars with Deliveroo and Just Eat. In 2017, Just Eat struck a \u00a310m-a-year deal to sponsor The X Factor, the biggest sponsorship deal for a weekly show on British TV, after TalkTalk ended its 10-year association with the reality talent show. Earlier this month Starbucks announced a deal with Uber Eats to pilot coffee-to-your-door in London following successful trials in the US. Uber is driving forward after almost being banned by Transport for London after being told it was not \u201cfit and proper\u201d to hold a private hire vehicle operator licence. In June last year Uber won a 15-month probationary licence to work in London after making sweeping changes to its practices.

The circular trek peaks three times \u2013 each at over 5,000 metres \u2013 and is regarded as the highest trek in Peru. I completed the circuit at 16 and while fit, I was hardly a finely tuned athlete. But acclimatising to altitude is essential. You are rewarded with some of the most stunning scenery in the world \u2013 with plenty of glaciers and cobalt-blue lakes. It\u2019s a five-night camping trip so it\u2019s handy there are several hot springs en route for bathing.

Black water rafting in the underground cave system in Waitomo, North Island, is such fun that once won\u2019t feel like enough.

On another day, head an hour\u2019s drive west to Alpes du Grand Serre and experience the thrill of scrambling, climbing and traversing along rock, over a raging river and coming out at the top into a beautiful alpine meadow with rosy cheeks and a spring in your tired step. If you enjoyed this, head next to Cascade de la Fare in Vaujany, just half an hour north of Le Bourg. This is a step up and includes two long bridges over a ravine and an ascent to a waterfall with sensational views. Karen Abell Peru with altitude The Ausangate Circuit in Peru is no small undertaking. The circular trek peaks three times \u2013 each at over 5,000 metres \u2013 and is regarded as the highest trek in Peru. I completed the circuit at 16 and while fit, I was hardly a finely tuned athlete. But acclimatising to altitude is essential. You are rewarded with some of the most stunning scenery in the world \u2013 with plenty of glaciers and cobalt-blue lakes. It\u2019s a five-night camping trip so it\u2019s handy there are several hot springs en route for bathing. We travelled from Cusco having spent three days acclimatising there, taking a three-hour drive to the start of the trek (4,000 metres) in Tinqui. We went with Outlook Expeditions, who put us in touch with a local guide. Freya Cave-rafting with glow-worms, New Zealand Lie back and enjoy the glow-worms, they said, and they were right.

After four previous pregnancies, Rivers, then in her mid-20s, had grown accustomed to hospital staff ignoring her and treating her disrespectfully.</p> <p>Half an hour later, Rivers was still in a wheelchair at the registration desk. \u201cDon\u2019t push,\u201d a nurse said as she passed. Another nurse saw that blood was running down Rivers\u2019 leg. She asked Rivers to stand up so they could put pads beneath her. Then the nurse saw the baby\u2019s head begin to crown.</p> <p>\u201cTake her to labor and delivery,\u201d Rivers\u2019 aunt yelled to hospital staff. Instead, nurses took her to triage.

But a few minutes into soaking, she felt a rush of cold water down her leg followed by a deep pain in her cervix. \u201cThis can\u2019t be,\u201d Rivers thought. \u201cNot again.\u201d Her water broke. She was going into labor at 32 weeks, two months before her due date. Instead of unwinding, Rivers found herself lying in the backseat of her aunt\u2019s brand new Cadillac, being rushed to the hospital. Despite promptly informing medical staff that she was in labor, Rivers was taken to registration to fill out paperwork instead of a delivery room. \u201cI\u2019m in labor,\u201d she repeated to the intake nurse, who tuned out her pleas. After four previous pregnancies, Rivers, then in her mid-20s, had grown accustomed to hospital staff ignoring her and treating her disrespectfully. Half an hour later, Rivers was still in a wheelchair at the registration desk. \u201cDon\u2019t push,\u201d a nurse said as she passed. Another nurse saw that blood was running down Rivers\u2019 leg. She asked Rivers to stand up so they could put pads beneath her. Then the nurse saw the baby\u2019s head begin to crown. \u201cTake her to labor and delivery,\u201d Rivers\u2019 aunt yelled to hospital staff. Instead, nurses took her to triage. Minutes later, before her doctor arrived, Jyahri Pye was born. At just over four pounds, Pye became one out of every 10 infants born prematurely in the United States. Rivers, 39, has had nine miscarriages in 14 years, and one baby who died at six months. She says the loss left her feeling worthless. \u201cIt made me feel like my body wasn\u2019t equipped to birth a child or even to carry one,\u201d Rivers says. \u201cI labeled myself the black widow spider after I had my fourth miscarriage. A black widow has babies and then she eats them.\u201d Rivers is far from alone in her loss. Of the 100 largest American cities, Detroit leads the nation in premature births \u2013 the leading cause of black infant death. Black infants die from premature birth at a rate more than twice that of the rest of the United States. Eighty-three per cent of Detroit\u2019s residents are African American, and the preterm birth rate among black women in Michigan is 55% percent higher than the rate among all other women in the state. If there is success of a live birth, babies in Detroit are still at higher risk of death \u2013 15 of every 1,000 babies born there die before their first birthday, compared with the national average of six. According to the National Institute of Health, women residing in economically deprived areas \u2013 Detroit qualifies, with more than 50% of children living below poverty level and an unemployment rate more than double the national average \u2013 are at increased risk of preterm birth. But in Detroit, the deprivation is even more extreme. Black mothers also face mass water shut-offs, hospitals deserts and stress from economic racism. According to the March of Dimes, an organization which closely tracks infant mortality, \u201chigh levels of continuous stress can cause health problems, such as high blood pressure and heart disease. When you\u2019re pregnant, this type of stress can increase the chances of having a premature baby or a low-birthweight baby.\u201d Dr Keisha Bentley-Edwards, professor and researcher at Duke University, has been studying stress from racism and its impact on black people for almost 15 years. \u201cThe culmination of everyday racial slights, institutional racism that can impact employment, and access to quality care influence bodily functioning,\u201d Bentley-Edwards says. \u201cStress from racism is detrimental to black women and their babies while still in their mother\u2019s womb.\u201d Abandoned and burnt-out homes line many streets in Detroit, and large swaths of land where communities once thrived now sit barren.

Small or large, one-time or recurring, every contribution helped us cross the finish line. We ultimately raised $1,006,076 in just over a month, all of which will be reinvested in the Guardian\u2019s fact-based, independent journalism in 2019.

Your top four choices \u2013 and our plan to tackle the stories \u2013 are below.</p> <h2>You voted for: coverage of voting rights and voter suppression</h2> <p><strong>Our plan: </strong>We will make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/us-voter-supression\">voting rights</a> a key part of our coverage between now and the 2020 election. This is an issue we strived to cover in the run-up to the midterms but we are formulating a more ambitious project \u2013 that would also involve other organizations \u2013 that would help map the rolling back of voting rights across the United States. Looking at the human stories of those prevented from exercising their democratic right, and investigating the systemic political obstructions placed in their way, we hope our voting rights project will offer a 360-degree look at one of the gravest failures of democracy in the US.</p> <h2><strong>You voted for: coverage of plastic pollution and zero waste</strong></h2> <p><strong>Our plan: </strong>With more than 340m tons of plastic produced globally each year \u2013 enough to fill every skyscraper in New York City \u2013 the crisis is a growing focus.

The political map of the US is changing, and the number of Americans affected by an economic system that is failing to deliver is growing. The Trump base is but a part of that.

      "bodyText": "Why are insects dying in droves? What\u2019s the US role in the Yemen tragedy? How is technology changing our brains? Those are among the hundreds of story ideas you, our readers, suggested when we invited you to share ideas for 2019, as part of our year-end fundraising campaign. Nearly 1,000 people sent ideas \u2013 and our favorites have already been assigned in our newsroom. (More on the selections below.) The outpouring of brilliant ideas was matched by your outpouring of generosity. In November, we set an ambitious goal to raise $1m in year-end gifts from US readers to help us tell the stories of 2019. Tens of thousands of you \u2013 from all 50 states and DC \u2013 made contributions, ranging from $1 into the thousands. Small or large, one-time or recurring, every contribution helped us cross the finish line. We ultimately raised $1,006,076 in just over a month, all of which will be reinvested in the Guardian\u2019s fact-based, independent journalism in 2019. Special shout out to Vermont, Washington and Oregon \u2013 the three states where the highest share of the population contributed. (And if you\u2019d still like to make a contribution to support the Guardian\u2019s journalism, it\u2019s certainly not too late; you can do so here.) Thank you! The Guardian is built in partnership with our readers, and we deeply value your input in our coverage. In addition to seeking contributions and story ideas, we asked readers to vote on the topics they wanted us to cover most in 2019. More on the winning topics and our coverage plans below. We asked our readers to vote on 12 topics we were considering covering in depth in 2019. Your top four choices \u2013 and our plan to tackle the stories \u2013 are below. You voted for: coverage of voting rights and voter suppression Our plan: We will make voting rights a key part of our coverage between now and the 2020 election. This is an issue we strived to cover in the run-up to the midterms but we are formulating a more ambitious project \u2013 that would also involve other organizations \u2013 that would help map the rolling back of voting rights across the United States. Looking at the human stories of those prevented from exercising their democratic right, and investigating the systemic political obstructions placed in their way, we hope our voting rights project will offer a 360-degree look at one of the gravest failures of democracy in the US. You voted for: coverage of plastic pollution and zero waste Our plan: With more than 340m tons of plastic produced globally each year \u2013 enough to fill every skyscraper in New York City \u2013 the crisis is a growing focus. We\u2019ve launched a new column on personal consumption, exploring how plastic makes its way from our homes into our environment. We\u2019ll cover how to stop synthetic clothing from poisoning waterways and where plastic bags go when you \u201crecycle\u201d them. Separately, our environment team will continue to cover the global story of plastic pollution in our oceans and landfills, with a focus on public health. You voted for: coverage of the ethics of big tech Our plan: In 2018, the Guardian and its sister paper, the Observer, broke the story of Cambridge Analytica, revealing how a political consulting firm harvested the data of 50,000 Facebook users to help Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. In the coming year, the Guardian\u2019s west coast bureau will continue to hold the tech industry accountable for its unprecedented power and influence over ordinary people\u2019s lives. Our reporting will examine questions including how algorithms shape the lives of workers and voters around the globe and how big tech spends money to influence politics. And from diversity to pay, we will continue scrutinizing how the most powerful companies treat their workers \u2013 and uncovering the ways in which exclusionary work environments impact the technologies shaping our society. You voted for: solutions to America\u2019s gun violence Our plan: Why don\u2019t we treat gun violence the way we do heart disease, diabetes or Zika? As an epidemic that takes more than 30,000 American lives each year, gun violence is a devastating public health crisis. Yet it\u2019s rarely covered from this perspective.

He won this mighty challenge on the banking alongside teammates Kamui Kobayashi, Renger van der Zande and Jordan Taylor for Wayne Taylor Racing. The race was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IMSA/status/1089605235100868613\" title=\"\">interrupted and then curtailed due to heavy rain</a> but Alonso had without doubt earned his winner\u2019s Rolex.</p> <p>On his first stint he went from sixth to the lead in the space of 13 laps, in only his third 24-hour race. More was to come \u2013 he was soon running two seconds a lap quicker than the opposition, a field of experienced sportscar drivers. When he returned for his second stint in wet conditions, he was a class apart. As the rest of the field struggled for grip, Alonso took just 16 laps to open up a 40-second lead.</p> <p>Breathtaking stuff, but no less than what might have been expected. He did similar on his way to winning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/17/fernando-alonso-wins-le-mans-24hours-toyota\" title=\"\">the Le Mans 24 hours at his first attempt last year</a>. At La Sarthe Alonso had put in a stint for Toyota through the night where he was consistently between two and four seconds quicker than anyone else on track. He was untouchable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1533f804ff658517847be2128f35e298d05c0bd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1533f804ff658517847be2128f35e298d05c0bd3/58_118_2826_1696/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fernando Alonso was at the Daytona 24 Hours alongside Wayne Taylor Racing teammates Kamui Kobayashi, Renger van der Zande and Jordan Taylor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fernando Alonso was at the Daytona 24 Hours alongside Wayne Taylor Racing teammates Kamui Kobayashi, Renger van der Zande and Jordan Taylor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Raoux/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That victory, alongside his F1 world championship (or Monaco victory, Alonso meets either criteria) has set him up for the chance to go for motor racing\u2019s triple crown, with a win at the Indy 500 this year. If he does so he will join Graham Hill as the only driver to have achieved the feat but more is within his grasp.</p> <p>Immediately after Daytona, that fierce competitiveness was already looking for a new outlet. \u201cRight now my full focus is on the Indy 500, but I\u2019m thinking. I\u2019m trying to do something more in different disciplines that are not only circuits,\u201d he told Racer magazine. \u201cBut I need to think, I need to plan, I need to make sure that I\u2019m competitive. So I need to be very calm and clever with the decisions with the future. The aim is to do something unprecedented in motorsport.\u201d</p> <p>Something he could realistically achieve. In the next month Alonso is expected to test the Dakar rally-wining Toyota team car that Nasser al-Attiyah drove to victory for the team in the off-road classic earlier this month. Toyota are understood to be putting plans in place to support him should he choose to enter the rally raid event and Attiyah will help and conduct the test with Alonso.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is an entirely different discipline and a huge challenge but Alonso is fired up like never before. He is in a position to notch up achievements that will set him apart. The Daytona win makes him only the third F1 champion, after Phil Hill and Mario Andretti, to win an endurance race there \u2013 and the first to do so in its 24-hour format. With Le Mans he now has two of endurance racing\u2019s triple crown, and although he will not compete at the Sebring 12 hours this year, which is on the same track and weekend as his World Endurance Championship (WEC) commitments, a win at the race on the old airfield in future is easily within his compass.</p> <p>As is another world championship. He leads the WEC drivers\u2019 championship with three rounds to go. He could clinch it at the finale with another Le Mans 24 Hours win in June. Then there might be Formula E, which would be ecstatic to take on a driver of his calibre and profile, while at 37 there is still ample time to master more one-offs such as the N\u00fcrburgring and Spa 24s. If his spirt of adventure and desire to prove himself remains, why not the classic Pikes Peak hill climb in Colorado or mastering Mount Panorama in Australia\u2019s Bathurst 1000?</p> <p>Alonso wants to do something unprecedented. Right now he is the only driver of the modern era genuinely in a position to do so and still hungry enough to make it happen.</p>",

The race was interrupted and then curtailed due to heavy rain but Alonso had without doubt earned his winner\u2019s Rolex. On his first stint he went from sixth to the lead in the space of 13 laps, in only his third 24-hour race. More was to come \u2013 he was soon running two seconds a lap quicker than the opposition, a field of experienced sportscar drivers. When he returned for his second stint in wet conditions, he was a class apart. As the rest of the field struggled for grip, Alonso took just 16 laps to open up a 40-second lead. Breathtaking stuff, but no less than what might have been expected. He did similar on his way to winning the Le Mans 24 hours at his first attempt last year. At La Sarthe Alonso had put in a stint for Toyota through the night where he was consistently between two and four seconds quicker than anyone else on track. He was untouchable. That victory, alongside his F1 world championship (or Monaco victory, Alonso meets either criteria) has set him up for the chance to go for motor racing\u2019s triple crown, with a win at the Indy 500 this year. If he does so he will join Graham Hill as the only driver to have achieved the feat but more is within his grasp. Immediately after Daytona, that fierce competitiveness was already looking for a new outlet. \u201cRight now my full focus is on the Indy 500, but I\u2019m thinking. I\u2019m trying to do something more in different disciplines that are not only circuits,\u201d he told Racer magazine. \u201cBut I need to think, I need to plan, I need to make sure that I\u2019m competitive. So I need to be very calm and clever with the decisions with the future. The aim is to do something unprecedented in motorsport.\u201d Something he could realistically achieve. In the next month Alonso is expected to test the Dakar rally-wining Toyota team car that Nasser al-Attiyah drove to victory for the team in the off-road classic earlier this month. Toyota are understood to be putting plans in place to support him should he choose to enter the rally raid event and Attiyah will help and conduct the test with Alonso. It is an entirely different discipline and a huge challenge but Alonso is fired up like never before. He is in a position to notch up achievements that will set him apart. The Daytona win makes him only the third F1 champion, after Phil Hill and Mario Andretti, to win an endurance race there \u2013 and the first to do so in its 24-hour format. With Le Mans he now has two of endurance racing\u2019s triple crown, and although he will not compete at the Sebring 12 hours this year, which is on the same track and weekend as his World Endurance Championship (WEC) commitments, a win at the race on the old airfield in future is easily within his compass. As is another world championship. He leads the WEC drivers\u2019 championship with three rounds to go. He could clinch it at the finale with another Le Mans 24 Hours win in June. Then there might be Formula E, which would be ecstatic to take on a driver of his calibre and profile, while at 37 there is still ample time to master more one-offs such as the N\u00fcrburgring and Spa 24s. If his spirt of adventure and desire to prove himself remains, why not the classic Pikes Peak hill climb in Colorado or mastering Mount Panorama in Australia\u2019s Bathurst 1000? Alonso wants to do something unprecedented. Right now he is the only driver of the modern era genuinely in a position to do so and still hungry enough to make it happen.",

Yet errors of the kind that happened to the boy with the undescended testicle keep occurring. Two have happened in my own trust in recent months.

We have noted many successes for the checklist since 2009, both here and abroad. But there have also been failures. A study in 100 hospitals in Ontario, Canada in 2014 found <a href=\"https://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140313/NEWS/303139957\" title=\"\">no reduction in complications or deaths</a>.

Some surgeons scoffed at the idea that such basic checks could make a difference. Some objected that it was a box-ticking exercise. Staff complained it was poorly worded, time-consuming, inappropriate or redundant \u2013 and bridled at what was felt to be another top-down initiative. These were among our findings when our team at Imperial College looked at 10 hospitals in the NHS to try to understand why the checklist failed. But we also found engaging in a shared exercise at the start of each operation, involving every member of staff from the most senior surgeon to the most junior nurse, helped flatten hierarchies and identify dangerous omissions that might otherwise have been missed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/21/operation-on-wrong-testicle-two-year-old-boy-bristol\">Operation on wrong testicle leaves two-year-old boy 'castrated'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The object of the checklist is not to eliminate thought but to stimulate it, by assisting professionals with the myriad routine tasks they must carry out, freeing them to do what they are trained to do \u2013 deliver skilled care. Getting momentum before takeoff \u2013 in the cockpit and in the operating theatre \u2013 does help.</p> <p>For checklists to work, however, surgical units must make them their own, with local champions, regular feedback and sharing of experiences.

Today we are moving to mobile-first and clinically led digital solutions with algorithmically driven alerts embracing behavioural insights. I foresee the introduction of an intelligent checklist based on a deeper understanding of human factors, automating many of the checks, yet involving each member of staff. Team dynamics and a safety culture will always be vital.

In January, at a meeting at the Royal Society of Medicine to celebrate a decade of the checklist\u2019s adoption in the NHS, I said there had been significant improvements in the safety of surgery over the last decade. Yet errors of the kind that happened to the boy with the undescended testicle keep occurring. Two have happened in my own trust in recent months. Latest figures published in November 2018 show there were 344 \u201cnever events\u201d across the NHS in the previous eight months \u2013 incidents that should never happen if the right procedures are followed \u2013 of which 138 involved wrong site surgery. Why do they keep happening? We have noted many successes for the checklist since 2009, both here and abroad. But there have also been failures. A study in 100 hospitals in Ontario, Canada in 2014 found no reduction in complications or deaths. A study in Michigan, US, the following year also found no effect. Checklists were originally developed by the aviation industry to help pilots ensure they had made the necessary cockpit checks, reduce complexity and foster teamwork. Flying is now among the safest forms of transport on, or off, the Earth. But when applied to medicine, they have met resistance. Some surgeons scoffed at the idea that such basic checks could make a difference. Some objected that it was a box-ticking exercise. Staff complained it was poorly worded, time-consuming, inappropriate or redundant \u2013 and bridled at what was felt to be another top-down initiative. These were among our findings when our team at Imperial College looked at 10 hospitals in the NHS to try to understand why the checklist failed. But we also found engaging in a shared exercise at the start of each operation, involving every member of staff from the most senior surgeon to the most junior nurse, helped flatten hierarchies and identify dangerous omissions that might otherwise have been missed. The object of the checklist is not to eliminate thought but to stimulate it, by assisting professionals with the myriad routine tasks they must carry out, freeing them to do what they are trained to do \u2013 deliver skilled care. Getting momentum before takeoff \u2013 in the cockpit and in the operating theatre \u2013 does help. For checklists to work, however, surgical units must make them their own, with local champions, regular feedback and sharing of experiences. They must be inclusive and simple to implement. And here is where technology can help. The paper-based checklist was already old technology when it was introduced. Today we are moving to mobile-first and clinically led digital solutions with algorithmically driven alerts embracing behavioural insights. I foresee the introduction of an intelligent checklist based on a deeper understanding of human factors, automating many of the checks, yet involving each member of staff. Team dynamics and a safety culture will always be vital. But we must also embrace technology, or we won\u2019t get anywhere in the NHS. \u2022 Lord Darzi is a surgeon and director of the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London.

      "bodyText": "A church service that has been performed continuously for 96 days has come to an end after the Dutch government agreed to pardon a family the pastors were shielding from deportation as part of a wider amnesty. Sasun Tamrazyan, his wife Anousche and their children Hayarpi, 21, Warduhi, 19, and Seyran, 15, have been holed up in the Bethel church in The Hague since October, relying on a medieval law that says immigration authorities cannot enter while a religious service is being performed. The family, who have been in the Netherland for nine years, had claimed their lives would be in danger if they returned to Armenia, where Sasun had been a political activist. But this week the Dutch coalition government announced under pressure from campaigners that they would examine the cases of 700 children and their families who are under the threat of deportation. Residency rights were likely to be granted in 630 of the cases, government officials said. Derk Stegeman, a pastor at the Bethel church, said the Tamrazyan family had been reassured that they would be included among those allowed to stay in the country. Hayarpi Tamrazyan, an econometrics student at Tilburg University, said on leaving the church with her parents and siblings that it was \u201cunreal, it is a relief\u201d to \u201cfinally go outside again, walk around\u201d. \u201cThe church has become a home,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have had sad but also very beautiful moments. The Bethelkerk [Bethel church] is for me now a special building, but I am glad that I can get out of it and can continue to build on my future.\u201d The amnesty was the result of an intense debate within the coalition government over the future of the so-called kinderpardon, a dispensation available to families with children who have lived in the Netherlands for more than five years, but which has been patchily applied. The Dutch government, led by Mark Rutte of the centre right VVD, includes the progressive D66 and two Christian parties, the relatively moderate CDA and the more conservative Christian Union. As part of the agreement, the kinderpardon will be taken off the statute books but the head of the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) now has the discretionary authority in such cases rather than a politician. The government also said that only 500 rather than 750 people a year would be taken from refugee camps run by the UN in war zones. Luke Korlaar, head of protection at the the UN refugee agency in the Netherlands, said he was \u201chappy for the children\u201d but expressed his \u201cpity that it is at the expense of refugees that need it\u201d. Theo Hettema, chair of the General Council of the Protestant Church in The Hague, said he was \u201cvery grateful for a safe future for hundreds of refugees in the Netherlands\u201d but also expressed his concern about the government\u2019s wider immigration policy.",

Polyethylene terephthalate (Pet) and polyester were also widely present. As well as accidental consumption, microplastics are ingested indirectly when predators consume contaminated prey such as fish.</p> <p>On average, 5.5 particles were found in the guts of each animal, suggesting they pass through the digestive system, or are regurgitated. \u201cThe low number of microplastics in their gut at any one time doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate to the chemical burden within their body because the exposure is chronic and cumulative,\u201d said Nelms. \u201cIt\u2019s also not yet understood how synthetic particles physically interact with the gut wall as they pass through.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Penelope Lindeque, the head of the marine plastics research group at PML, has found microplastics in animals at every level of the food chain, from tiny zooplankton to fish larvae, turtles, and now marine mammals.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s disconcerting that plastic is everywhere \u2013 all animals are exposed to it and they are ingesting it in their natural environment,\u201d she said. \u201cThe ocean is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/14/sea-to-plate-plastic-got-into-fish\">a soup of microplastics</a> and it\u2019s only going to get worse, so we need to reduce the amount of plastic waste released into our seas now.\u201d</p> <p>Species with a long lifespan such as dolphins and seals are good indicators of marine ecosystem health, but as top predators they are susceptible to the accumulation of pollutants such as toxins or plastics.</p> <p>Lindeque said: \u201cThere\u2019s a risk that chemicals within the plastic and chemicals that stick to the outside of the microplastics, such as PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), could affect these animals.

      "bodyText": "Microplastics are being widely ingested by Britain\u2019s marine mammals, scientists say, with samples found in every animal examined in a study. The research on 50 stranded creatures including porpoises, dolphins, grey seals and a pygmy sperm whale is the most comprehensive analysis of microplastics in the digestive tracts of both wild cetaceans and seals. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking \u2013 but not surprising \u2013 that every animal had ingested microplastics,\u201d said Sarah Nelms, of the University of Exeter and Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML), lead author of the research published in the journal Scientific Reports. The study found that nylon made up more than 60% of the microplastics, with possible sources including fishing rope and nets, clothing microfibres and toothbrush bristles. Polyethylene terephthalate (Pet) and polyester were also widely present. As well as accidental consumption, microplastics are ingested indirectly when predators consume contaminated prey such as fish. On average, 5.5 particles were found in the guts of each animal, suggesting they pass through the digestive system, or are regurgitated. \u201cThe low number of microplastics in their gut at any one time doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate to the chemical burden within their body because the exposure is chronic and cumulative,\u201d said Nelms. \u201cIt\u2019s also not yet understood how synthetic particles physically interact with the gut wall as they pass through.\u201d Dr Penelope Lindeque, the head of the marine plastics research group at PML, has found microplastics in animals at every level of the food chain, from tiny zooplankton to fish larvae, turtles, and now marine mammals. \u201cIt\u2019s disconcerting that plastic is everywhere \u2013 all animals are exposed to it and they are ingesting it in their natural environment,\u201d she said. \u201cThe ocean is a soup of microplastics and it\u2019s only going to get worse, so we need to reduce the amount of plastic waste released into our seas now.\u201d Species with a long lifespan such as dolphins and seals are good indicators of marine ecosystem health, but as top predators they are susceptible to the accumulation of pollutants such as toxins or plastics. Lindeque said: \u201cThere\u2019s a risk that chemicals within the plastic and chemicals that stick to the outside of the microplastics, such as PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), could affect these animals. We are increasingly worried that microplastics could also be a vector for viruses and bacteria.\u201d In total, 26 species of marine mammal inhabit or pass through British waters. The 10 species of animals studied were found stranded along the coastline, from Cornwall to the Orkney Islands, and died as a result of disease or trauma, for example as bycatch in fishing nets, interaction with ships or attacks by bottlenose dolphins. Nelms expressed concern that long-term exposure to plastic pollution could damage the health of Britain\u2019s marine mammals: \u201cThey eat all sorts but it will reach a tipping point and really affect their health.

Inside, Patricia Angol is playing the xylophone, Mui Tang is touching a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/09/whats-that-sound-kaoss-pad\">Kaoss Pad</a> \u2013 an audio effects unit \u2013 and Fathima Maharali is singing into a microphone. When they finish, their session leader, Jack Daley, fiddles on a computer, overlaying each musical section before playing it back. There are smiles and high-fives all round.</p> <p>Daley is a music producer who works at the <a href=\"http://directory.islington.gov.uk/kb5/islington/directory/service.page?id=NCMXumdjuls\">Daylight centre</a> for adults with learning disabilities, which is run by Islington council. He started private and group sessions composing and producing electronic music with service users two years ago. Since then, countless song lyrics have been written, an <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/album/id/1443018702\">EP has been released</a> (with another on the way), and there\u2019s an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxFMc60kaA\">animated music video</a> to go with the title track, Watermelon Fantasy.

She\u2019s always loved listening to music so jumped at the chance to record her own. \u201cI like doing this because I get frustrated and bored at home,\u201d she says. Bruins, who has behavioural difficulties, also benefits from the sessions because they are an outlet for her anger: \u201cIt\u2019s a release for me and it stops me winding myself up and kicking out.\u201d Daley adds: \u201cHaving an hour focusing on Tina\u2019s life helps her concentrate and get out of her head. She\u2019s got a lot of energy and doesn\u2019t have the resources to use it in a positive way when she\u2019s out of the centre.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxFMc60kaA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PfxFMc60kaA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The video for Watermelon Fantasy.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Daley fell into this line of work after finishing an MA in music production four years ago. He had experience in care and came to the centre originally as a stopgap until he found a job in music. He spotted a room that was being used for storage and asked if he could turn it into a studio. The centre has a fund for activities, which allowed him to spend around \u00a33,000 on recording equipment, and he hasn\u2019t looked back since. \u201cThere\u2019s an equality through doing creative and artistic work with these guys because they interact so emotionally,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re free and open to explore the instruments. It feels so genuine, even if the music ends up sounding really weird.\u201d</p> <p>Olly Price, a professional songwriter who runs a label and also leads sessions at the centre, has worked with Daley and the service users on some of the music.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s 11am on Friday morning and there are some weird and wonderful psychedelic sounds emanating from a small, makeshift music studio in north London. Inside, Patricia Angol is playing the xylophone, Mui Tang is touching a Kaoss Pad \u2013 an audio effects unit \u2013 and Fathima Maharali is singing into a microphone. When they finish, their session leader, Jack Daley, fiddles on a computer, overlaying each musical section before playing it back. There are smiles and high-fives all round. Daley is a music producer who works at the Daylight centre for adults with learning disabilities, which is run by Islington council. He started private and group sessions composing and producing electronic music with service users two years ago. Since then, countless song lyrics have been written, an EP has been released (with another on the way), and there\u2019s an animated music video to go with the title track, Watermelon Fantasy. Everything has been produced by the people who attend the centre with the help of creative professionals. One service user who features on Watermelon Fantasy is 36-year-old Tina Bruins. She\u2019s always loved listening to music so jumped at the chance to record her own. \u201cI like doing this because I get frustrated and bored at home,\u201d she says. Bruins, who has behavioural difficulties, also benefits from the sessions because they are an outlet for her anger: \u201cIt\u2019s a release for me and it stops me winding myself up and kicking out.\u201d Daley adds: \u201cHaving an hour focusing on Tina\u2019s life helps her concentrate and get out of her head. She\u2019s got a lot of energy and doesn\u2019t have the resources to use it in a positive way when she\u2019s out of the centre.\u201d Daley fell into this line of work after finishing an MA in music production four years ago. He had experience in care and came to the centre originally as a stopgap until he found a job in music. He spotted a room that was being used for storage and asked if he could turn it into a studio. The centre has a fund for activities, which allowed him to spend around \u00a33,000 on recording equipment, and he hasn\u2019t looked back since. \u201cThere\u2019s an equality through doing creative and artistic work with these guys because they interact so emotionally,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re free and open to explore the instruments. It feels so genuine, even if the music ends up sounding really weird.\u201d Olly Price, a professional songwriter who runs a label and also leads sessions at the centre, has worked with Daley and the service users on some of the music. He says: \u201cSome of the tracks are unique and amazing. They\u2019re a challenging listen and I hope people will like them on that basis. There are also a few tracks that have crossover appeal. They\u2019re universally catchy, and weird and wonderful.\u201d Both Price and Daley see this as more than just making music. The sessions act as a way of empowering people, encouraging them to talk about their lives, build confidence and form bonds with others. Bruins and the others at the centre are lucky that this type of activity is on offer. The landscape in the UK for people with learning disabilities is grim. Austerity has hit councils, who fund day centres, hard. A recent review found that available funding to support people with learning disabilities is insufficient, and cuts have been detrimental to them, their families and carers. Individuals have lost social support and are experiencing increased social isolation. Price, who also runs a company that sends musicians into day centres and care homes around London, has seen this worsening environment first-hand. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating. Where I used to go to loads of day centres 12 years ago, we no longer really do.

That Plymouth Rock-sized gap in live-game experience could have been fodder to keep the internet trolls fed for weeks.

For long periods we watched as white broadcasters struggled to describe the league\u2019s black players without falling back on ugly stereotypes. <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/107769907705400104\">A 1977 SUNY-Oneonta study</a> matched the networks\u2019 telecast audio to the relevant players and their stats.

Even more telling, Rada noted just two black announcers in the 20 quarters of football that he studied.</p> \n<p>And while that count would probably come in slightly higher were Rada to do a follow-up study today, the glacial pace of black representation on NFL game telecasts stands in stark contrast to, say, the NBA, where diversity on the TV network mic is quotidian.

Who could forget Michael Vick, of all people, telling Colin Kaepernick that the only thing holding him back from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jul/18/michael-vick-colin-kaepernick-haircut-interview-nfl\">getting another job in the league was a haircut?</a> (Now Vick is a studio analyst on Fox.)

(Now, Ray Lewis is a studio analyst for Showtime\u2019s Inside the NFL.) Given those episodes, it\u2019s no wonder LeBron James thinks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/22/lebron-james-nfl-team-owners-have-slave-mentality\">the NFL has \u201ca slave mentality\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>Doubtless, it\u2019s an unflattering perception, but James is hardly the first to call it out.

Sure, announcing and in-game analysis (where words must not only be chosen quickly, but carefully) are vastly tougher mental exercises than pre- or post-game analysis (where there\u2019s more time to breathe and marinate on two or more quarters), but who\u2019s to say Fox Sports\u2019 Shannon Sharpe or the NFL Network\u2019s Nate Burleson couldn\u2019t do the job?

Her hospital room, she tells us, was known as the Good Mood Room.

D\u2019Eramo\u2019s account of the camps is full of surprising nuances (it is not the Nazi guards who beat her up, but the political prisoners who disapprove of her and her fellow \u201cAsocials\u201d), and it explores an unfamiliar aspect of the Third Reich.

A lot.</p></li> <li><p>If in a group, casually entertain her friends to the point where they all lean behind your back and mouth to her: \u201cHe\u2019s grrrreat.\u201d</p></li> <li><p>Gush about your love of street food and street theatre, which is like regular theatre just served in a bap.</p></li> <li><p>Mention that you play the acoustic guitar and one day dream of running a donkey sanctuary full of orangutans that will finally bring an end to the ivory trade.</p></li> <li><p>Plan a city break, but warn that you will always insist on going down the red channel at Customs. You\u2019ve just gotta declare your feelings!</p></li> <li><p>Show how in touch you are with all the many gender issues of the day by casually showing a screengrab of all your old Father Ted DVDs on eBay. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/oct/07/graham-linehan-police-warning-complaint-by-stephanie-hayden-transgender-activist-twitter\">Yes, Graham</a>, my chimney is trans, DEAL WITH IT!</p></li> <li><p>Playfully ask if they favour ready-to-eat over ripen-at-home? This will provide a fascinating avocado-based insight into how regularly they smash their own toast.</p></li> </ul> <p>Most of all, good luck and good love. Remember, whatever the outcome, I\u2019ll be circling regardless, ready to swoop. I\u2019m your worst nightmare. An emotional predator who dresses from Gap. So beware.

I\u2019ve been woke ever since the day I was first breastfed by an almond. That day was yesterday. Speaking as a man, it\u2019s not natural for me to keep all my wisdom to myself. That\u2019s just not how it works \u2013 and by \u201cit\u201d I mean my johnson. Perhaps I could offer tips on how to make that special someone you are planning on casually stifling feel like a million bitcoins? Help spread some great vibes? Ugh, I can\u2019t believe I used the word \u201chelp\u201d. It feels so triggering, just like the words \u201cRoger\u201d, \u201cLloyd\u201d and \u201cPack\u201d. Over the many Valentine\u2019s I\u2019ve spent patrolling various branches of the aptly named All Bar One, making moves so slow you\u2019ll swear you\u2019ve just been touched by a tectonic plate, I\u2019ve learned that emotionally manipulated relationships are all about giving people space. And that is something I will constantly keep telling you as I encroach. So here are my nine easy hints on how to engage with your Valentine from across a booth lit by a fading electronic candle in a tumbler. Be great company. Listen, don\u2019t hear. It\u2019s called conversation, not converbatim. And take time to balance your chin on your hand as you do. In a straight fight between listening and talking, listening would win every time. Not that I\u2019m into fighting of course, unless it\u2019s for equal pay in the workplace or how much I love Lena Dunham. Frequently drop rebound bombs such as \u201cwhat time is Bake Off?\u201d, \u201csnuggling for the win\u201d and, \u201cGod, I miss the Paralympics.\u201d Use the word \u201cglean\u201d. A lot. If in a group, casually entertain her friends to the point where they all lean behind your back and mouth to her: \u201cHe\u2019s grrrreat.\u201d Gush about your love of street food and street theatre, which is like regular theatre just served in a bap. Mention that you play the acoustic guitar and one day dream of running a donkey sanctuary full of orangutans that will finally bring an end to the ivory trade. Plan a city break, but warn that you will always insist on going down the red channel at Customs. You\u2019ve just gotta declare your feelings! Show how in touch you are with all the many gender issues of the day by casually showing a screengrab of all your old Father Ted DVDs on eBay. Yes, Graham, my chimney is trans, DEAL WITH IT! Playfully ask if they favour ready-to-eat over ripen-at-home? This will provide a fascinating avocado-based insight into how regularly they smash their own toast. Most of all, good luck and good love. Remember, whatever the outcome, I\u2019ll be circling regardless, ready to swoop. I\u2019m your worst nightmare. An emotional predator who dresses from Gap. So beware. Be very, very, aware. \u2022 Adam Riches is The Guy Who \u2026 is on at Drink, Shop &amp; Do, London N1 from 4 to 14 February",

      "bodyText": "End of the Road has announced that Beirut, Michael Kiwanuka, Metronomy and Spiritualized will be headlining the festival this year, hosted at Larmer Tree Gardens, on the Wiltshire-Dorset border, from 29 August to 1 September. Beirut, the whimsical, brass-laden project of singer-songwriter Zach Condon, are gearing up to release their fifth album Gallipoli this week, and their slot is the only headline appearance the band are making in the UK this year. British soul musician Kiwanuka supported Adele on her world tour in 2011 and won the BBC\u2019s Sound of 2012 poll; more recently won the 2017 Ivor Novello award for best song, for his politically engaged Black Man In a White World. This is his first major festival headline slot, and suggests new material will be released later this year. Indie disco staples Metronomy are celebrating their 10th anniversary this year with a reissue of their debut album, ahead of a new studio LP. Their most recent single, 2016\u2019s Hang Me Out to Dry, featured Robyn \u2013 the band\u2019s songwriter Joseph Mount went on to co-write her 2018 album Honey. Spiritualized meanwhile will be showcasing their eighth studio album And Nothing Hurt \u2013 their first album in six years \u2013 during their own headline slot. Deadpan Australian singer-songwriter Courtney Barnett will also be performing, while Jarvis Cocker, former frontman of Pulp, will be presenting his new full-band project JARV IS, performing both old and new songs. Irascible British punk minimalists Sleaford Mods, American slowcore veterans Low, and magnetic Japanese-American songwriter Mitski are among the other critically acclaimed acts, alongside Deerhunter, Cass McCombs, Let\u2019s Eat Grandma and others. Leftfield electronic music will come from Daniel Avery, Yves Tumor and Oliver Coates, while stars from the massively vibrant young UK jazz scene, such as Nubya Garcia, Moses Boyd and all-female band N\u00e9rija, will also appear. On the heavier side of things are post-punks Wire and Beak&gt;, garage punks Parquet Courts and Viagra Boys, and noisy psych-rockers Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs and Bilge Pump. \u2022 End of the Road festival, Larmer Tree Gardens, 29 August-1 September.",

I\u2019ve tried to recover it, but I don\u2019t have the phone number linked to my account because my phone was stolen. What should I do?<em> </em><strong>Tay</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>First, recover your phone number, which is much more important than the phone.</p> <p>When a phone is either lost or stolen, you should immediately contact your mobile network provider to tell them what\u2019s happened. They should then suspend the current sim and send you a replacement sim with the same phone number. This service should be free but sometimes incurs a nominal charge. It won\u2019t get your phone back, but it will make it harder for the thief to log on to your accounts and change your passwords.</p> <p>Some network providers can also block your handset\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Equipment_Identity\">IMEI</a> (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number. This makes it harder for the thief to use your phone with a different sim.</p> <p>Of course, you will need to be able to show that you own your phone number, and different companies may have different systems for different types of account. My advice is to be prepared. I wasn\u2019t, and it wasn\u2019t fun.</p> <h2><strong>Phone number recovery</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64463518581f57c29dae45d8f893e38ff781640c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64463518581f57c29dae45d8f893e38ff781640c/0_0_7917_4750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Proving to O2 that you own an account can be tricky.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Proving to O2 that you own an account can be tricky.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I lost my phone in November \u2013 I left it on a plane in Kuala Lumpur \u2013 I phoned O2 but couldn\u2019t pass the recovery tests, which included providing some numbers I\u2019d dialled in the past three months. Being 6,500 miles from home, I couldn\u2019t look up the phone number of my window cleaner, whose surname I couldn\u2019t remember.</p> <p>Back in the UK three weeks later, an O2 store refused to accept any other evidence that I owned this pay-as-you-go number, which was originally supplied by BT Cellnet before O2 was launched in 2002. It was on my business cards, in ancient emails, in online media databases and so on. I could also prove I owned the bank account that paid for its minutes. O2 wouldn\u2019t budge. Only after digging out my window cleaner\u2019s phone number did I eventually get a replacement sim.</p> <p>Not carrying around a written list of the numbers I\u2019d dialled was clearly a bad mistake on my part, but full marks to O2 for using the Data Protection Act to put my personal data at risk.</p> <p>If you have not yet lost your phone, or had it stolen, I strongly suggest that you find out what will happen if you do. You could easily lose a number you\u2019ve used for 20-odd years.</p> <h2><strong>Mitigating steps</strong></h2> <p>While trying to recover my number, I took steps to limit the damage someone could do if they were able to use my lost phone. You should likewise log on to any other accounts that hold your phone number, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and so on, including any mobile banking or payment systems. Set up and confirm an alternative email address as a way of recovering your accounts, delete the compromised phone number, and change your passwords before the thief can do the same thing.</p> <p>You can also try to disable or erase your phone remotely, via the web. If it\u2019s an iPhone, log on with your Apple ID and use <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/PH2700\">Lost Mode</a>, which is part of <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/explore/find-my-iphone-ipad-mac-watch\">Find My Phone</a>. If it\u2019s an <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6160491?hl=en\">Android phone</a>, log on to your Google account and go to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/android/find\">Find My Device</a>.</p> <p>This does depend on certain conditions, one of which is that the lost or stolen phone must have a mobile or wifi network connection.</p> <p>I did try to erase my lost phone, because it was backed up to Google Drive. I failed because, as far as I could tell, it was never switched on. It may still be flying between London and KL \u2026</p> <h2><strong>Email recovery</strong></h2> <p>You didn\u2019t mention which email service you were using, but most of them take the same approach. That is to say, you go to a web page and fill in a form to recover your email address.</p> <p>Forms typically ask for your email address, any passwords you remember, the answers to various security questions (the name of your first pet, or whatever), and the subject lines and email addresses of people you\u2019ve emailed. <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17875/microsoft-account-recover\">In Microsoft\u2019s case</a>, you can also provide the names of three Skype contacts.</p> <p>You can also create unique security codes to use if you lose or forget your email password. Microsoft lets you generate a single code from its <a href=\"https://account.live.com/proofs/Manage/additional\">Additional security options</a> page, while <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1187538\">Google lets you create 10</a>.</p> <p>If you are trying to recover an email address, you will usually need to provide a second email address so the company can contact you.</p> <p>It helps if you fill in the form with a device that you have used previously with the account you\u2019re trying to recover, and from the same place, such as your home network. Mail services now keep records of the devices and IP addresses you use (<a href=\"https://myaccount.google.com/device-activity?pli=1\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://account.live.com/activity\">Microsoft</a>). Indeed, they may well challenge you if you log on with a different device, or from a different country.</p> <p>If you normally download and answer your emails on a PC, you should not have a problem: you will have hundreds or even thousands of contact names and subject lines. If you only use email in a web browser, it may challenge your memory. One solution would be to screen-grab your inbox once a month, but it would be better to backup your emails, as explained below.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there are no technical tricks to recovering an email address. All you can do is provide as much information as possible, and as many different kinds of information as possible, even if some of it is slightly wrong.</p> <p>The real problem is that password resets and email recovery systems are usually the easiest way to hack someone\u2019s mailbox. You have to do better than a would-be hacker to get past the automated mailbox recovery software, and hackers who have studied your social media accounts can be very convincing.</p> <h2><strong>Taking steps\u2026</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5604706f6244e2d5e3a1bbf41b456b36c6ec40a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5604706f6244e2d5e3a1bbf41b456b36c6ec40a/544_347_1533_920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two-step verification can help keep your account safe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two-step verification can help keep your account safe, but relying on one-time codes sent via SMS can be a problem if your phone is stolen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you really want to be able to recover a mailbox, you need at least three ways to verify your account, on top of any security questions. For a start, you must have an alternative email address, and two is better. You should also have a mobile phone number, and possibly a landline number. All of these have to work, and you have to keep them all updated. It\u2019s extra work, but it\u2019s better than losing access to your main mailbox.</p> <p>If you use a school, university or work address as a recovery account, you may no longer have access to it a few years later, when you need it.</p> <p>When it comes to security questions, people have been hacked because their answers could be found from web searches or their social media accounts. Your mother\u2019s maiden name, past schools or the names of your pets may already be known, or easy to guess.</p> <p>This is an argument for providing <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/the_curse_of_th.html\">nonsensical answers</a>: nobody will guess that your favourite teacher was called 23o;Aif99#. But you will have to keep records of fake answers because you won\u2019t be able to guess them either.</p> <p>People often recommend two-step or two-factor authentication (2FA), but if this involves your email provider sending a one-time code to your mobile phone, then you\u2019re in trouble if you lose the phone. Also, <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2018/12/when-best-practice-is-not-good-enough/\">2FA users can still fall victim to phishing attacks</a>. It would be better to use a <a href=\"https://www.yubico.com/\">YubiKey</a>, like Facebook and Google employees. Just make sure you have <a href=\"https://support.yubico.com/support/solutions/articles/15000010242-duplicating-or-backing-up-a-yubikey\">a backup YubiKey</a> in case you break or lose the first one.</p> <h2><strong>Mail backups</strong></h2> <p>The risk of losing access to all your emails means you should have them backed up. For example, you could download all your emails to a PC program such as Microsoft Office Outlook, eM Client or Mozilla\u2019s Thunderbird. You could use <a href=\"https://www.mailstore.com/en/products/mailstore-home/\">MailStore Home 11</a> for Windows, which is free for home users, or <a href=\"https://www.mothsoftware.com/\">Mail Archiver X</a>, which is $39.95 for Mac users. You could back up your Gmail with <a href=\"http://gmvault.org/\">Gmvault</a>, and restore it to a different Gmail account.</p> <p>For an extra backup, I\u2019ve set my main mailbox to forward all incoming emails to my backup mailbox. The key trick is to remember, when you reply to emails, to bcc a copy to the backup account.</p> <p>I wouldn\u2019t like to lose access to my main email account, but at least I wouldn\u2019t lose any emails.</p> <p><strong>Have you got a question?

They should then suspend the current sim and send you a replacement sim with the same phone number. This service should be free but sometimes incurs a nominal charge. It won\u2019t get your phone back, but it will make it harder for the thief to log on to your accounts and change your passwords. Some network providers can also block your handset\u2019s IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number. This makes it harder for the thief to use your phone with a different sim. Of course, you will need to be able to show that you own your phone number, and different companies may have different systems for different types of account. My advice is to be prepared. I wasn\u2019t, and it wasn\u2019t fun. Phone number recovery When I lost my phone in November \u2013 I left it on a plane in Kuala Lumpur \u2013 I phoned O2 but couldn\u2019t pass the recovery tests, which included providing some numbers I\u2019d dialled in the past three months. Being 6,500 miles from home, I couldn\u2019t look up the phone number of my window cleaner, whose surname I couldn\u2019t remember. Back in the UK three weeks later, an O2 store refused to accept any other evidence that I owned this pay-as-you-go number, which was originally supplied by BT Cellnet before O2 was launched in 2002. It was on my business cards, in ancient emails, in online media databases and so on. I could also prove I owned the bank account that paid for its minutes. O2 wouldn\u2019t budge. Only after digging out my window cleaner\u2019s phone number did I eventually get a replacement sim. Not carrying around a written list of the numbers I\u2019d dialled was clearly a bad mistake on my part, but full marks to O2 for using the Data Protection Act to put my personal data at risk. If you have not yet lost your phone, or had it stolen, I strongly suggest that you find out what will happen if you do. You could easily lose a number you\u2019ve used for 20-odd years. Mitigating steps While trying to recover my number, I took steps to limit the damage someone could do if they were able to use my lost phone. You should likewise log on to any other accounts that hold your phone number, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and so on, including any mobile banking or payment systems. Set up and confirm an alternative email address as a way of recovering your accounts, delete the compromised phone number, and change your passwords before the thief can do the same thing. You can also try to disable or erase your phone remotely, via the web. If it\u2019s an iPhone, log on with your Apple ID and use Lost Mode, which is part of Find My Phone. If it\u2019s an Android phone, log on to your Google account and go to Find My Device. This does depend on certain conditions, one of which is that the lost or stolen phone must have a mobile or wifi network connection. I did try to erase my lost phone, because it was backed up to Google Drive. I failed because, as far as I could tell, it was never switched on. It may still be flying between London and KL \u2026 Email recovery You didn\u2019t mention which email service you were using, but most of them take the same approach. That is to say, you go to a web page and fill in a form to recover your email address. Forms typically ask for your email address, any passwords you remember, the answers to various security questions (the name of your first pet, or whatever), and the subject lines and email addresses of people you\u2019ve emailed. In Microsoft\u2019s case, you can also provide the names of three Skype contacts. You can also create unique security codes to use if you lose or forget your email password. Microsoft lets you generate a single code from its Additional security options page, while Google lets you create 10. If you are trying to recover an email address, you will usually need to provide a second email address so the company can contact you. It helps if you fill in the form with a device that you have used previously with the account you\u2019re trying to recover, and from the same place, such as your home network. Mail services now keep records of the devices and IP addresses you use (Google, Microsoft). Indeed, they may well challenge you if you log on with a different device, or from a different country. If you normally download and answer your emails on a PC, you should not have a problem: you will have hundreds or even thousands of contact names and subject lines. If you only use email in a web browser, it may challenge your memory. One solution would be to screen-grab your inbox once a month, but it would be better to backup your emails, as explained below. Unfortunately, there are no technical tricks to recovering an email address. All you can do is provide as much information as possible, and as many different kinds of information as possible, even if some of it is slightly wrong. The real problem is that password resets and email recovery systems are usually the easiest way to hack someone\u2019s mailbox. You have to do better than a would-be hacker to get past the automated mailbox recovery software, and hackers who have studied your social media accounts can be very convincing. Taking steps\u2026 If you really want to be able to recover a mailbox, you need at least three ways to verify your account, on top of any security questions. For a start, you must have an alternative email address, and two is better. You should also have a mobile phone number, and possibly a landline number. All of these have to work, and you have to keep them all updated. It\u2019s extra work, but it\u2019s better than losing access to your main mailbox. If you use a school, university or work address as a recovery account, you may no longer have access to it a few years later, when you need it. When it comes to security questions, people have been hacked because their answers could be found from web searches or their social media accounts. Your mother\u2019s maiden name, past schools or the names of your pets may already be known, or easy to guess. This is an argument for providing nonsensical answers: nobody will guess that your favourite teacher was called 23o;Aif99#. But you will have to keep records of fake answers because you won\u2019t be able to guess them either. People often recommend two-step or two-factor authentication (2FA), but if this involves your email provider sending a one-time code to your mobile phone, then you\u2019re in trouble if you lose the phone. Also, 2FA users can still fall victim to phishing attacks. It would be better to use a YubiKey, like Facebook and Google employees. Just make sure you have a backup YubiKey in case you break or lose the first one. Mail backups The risk of losing access to all your emails means you should have them backed up. For example, you could download all your emails to a PC program such as Microsoft Office Outlook, eM Client or Mozilla\u2019s Thunderbird. You could use MailStore Home 11 for Windows, which is free for home users, or Mail Archiver X, which is $39.95 for Mac users. You could back up your Gmail with Gmvault, and restore it to a different Gmail account. For an extra backup, I\u2019ve set my main mailbox to forward all incoming emails to my backup mailbox. The key trick is to remember, when you reply to emails, to bcc a copy to the backup account. I wouldn\u2019t like to lose access to my main email account, but at least I wouldn\u2019t lose any emails. Have you got a question? Email it to Ask.Jack@theguardian.com",

AI-assisted facial recognition software has been an early flashpoint. Amazon\u2019s move to sell its facial recognition software, Rekognition, to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) prompted protest from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a small group of shareholders and a hundred-or-so employees. Bezos was not deterred. AWS sales teams have also pitched Rekognition at defense industry events. Amazon declined to say which agencies, if any, are using Rekognition. What is clear to observers, though, is AWS\u2019s desire to make money off defense and law enforcement customers. \u201cThey\u2019ve been consistent in selling these technologies at trade shows,\u201d said Shankar Narayan of the Washington state affiliate of the ACLU, which in January demanded Amazon, Google and Microsoft to stop selling artificial intelligence-assisted facial recognition to the US government. \u201cThey demo\u2019d it to Ice. The FBI is testing it.\u201d Amazon asserts Rekognition can spot Kalashnikovs and faces from a user-selected watchlist in near real-time. Image recognition software greatly speeds the review of surveillance footage. Speaking at an Amazon-organized conference in 2018, Christine Halvorsen, the FBI deputy assistant director for counterterrorism, said analysts combing video of the 2017 Las Vegas massacre could have completed their work in a day if they had access to Rekognition. Instead it took weeks to track the gunman\u2019s movements. Microsoft and Google have, to varying degrees, recognized civil liberties and human rights concerns raised by the new technology. Amazon has largely declined to address the moral dimensions of national security work. \u201cAmazon really has distinguished themselves as being an actor that doesn\u2019t acknowledge any responsibility and really has doubled down on selling these technologies to the government, the military as well as law enforcement,\u201d said Narayan. The company \u201chas largely hewed to the position that their founder has articulated, that society supposedly has this \u2018immune response\u2019 to new technologies like these and things will get sorted out on their own\u201d, Narayan said. \u201cThat\u2019s an attitude that rests on a great deal of privilege and doesn\u2019t really account for the human lives that are being impacted by this technology in real time.\u201d Amazon declined to respond to the ACLU comments. Amazon is widely regarded as the strongest contender for the Jedi contract. Competition for Jedi has been bitter. Amazon\u2019s rivals \u2013 Oracle, IBM and Microsoft \u2013 have protested, unsuccessfully thus far, that contract requirements they claim unfairly favor Amazon. Oracle, a California tech giant, sued the federal government in December. Attorneys for Oracle suggested defense department employees with connections to AWS biased the contract in Amazon\u2019s favor. Notably, the AWS general manager, Deap Ubhi, spent a year as a product director for the Defense Digital Service, the Pentagon\u2019s tech division. The Pentagon is currently reviewing Ubhi\u2019s work developing the Jedi contract. The impact of the Jedi contract will reverberate. Neil Gordon of the Project On Government Oversight, a watchdog group examining federal contracting, said the Jedi contract may give the winner a lasting advantage in US government cloud computing \u2013 \u201ca monopoly over this area for years to come\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The winner of Australia\u2019s richest literary prize did not attend the ceremony. His absence was not by choice. Behrouz Boochani, whose debut book won both the $25,000 non-fiction prize at the Victorian premier\u2019s literary awards and the $100,000 Victorian prize for literature on Thursday night, is not allowed into Australia. The Kurdish Iranian writer is an asylum seeker who has been kept in purgatory on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea for almost six years, first behind the wire of the Australian offshore detention centre, and then in alternative accommodation on the island. Now his book No Friend But the Mountains \u2013 composed one text message at a time from within the detention centre \u2013 has been recognised by a government from the same country that denied him access and locked him up. It is, he said, \u201ca paradoxical feeling\u201d. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d he told Guardian Australia in a conversation before the main award was announced, when he only knew of the non-fiction prize. \u201cI certainly did not write this book just to win an award. \u201cMy main aim has always been for the people in Australia and around the world to understand deeply how this system has tortured innocent people on Manus and Nauru in a systematic way for almost six years. I hope this award will bring more attention to our situation, and create change, and end this barbaric policy.\u201d Boochani speaks via text messages, because his internet connection keeps cutting out \u2013 the same method he used to write the book, an autobiographical account of his attempt to make the journey from Indonesia to Australia and his subsequent incarceration. Under Australia\u2019s hardline immigration policy, asylum seekers who try to reach the country by boat are processed at offshore centres. For an asylum seeker kept in offshore detention to win such a major prize \u201cbrings enormous shame to the Australian government\u201d, he said. Accepting the award on Boochani\u2019s behalf was his translator, Omid Tofighian, who worked with interpreter Moones Mansoubi to translate Boochani\u2019s Farsi text to English. \u201cYou can\u2019t underestimate the impact that [this win] will have on Australian politics and Australian refugee politics \u2013 not only in Australia [but for] displaced and exiled people all over the world,\u201d Tofighian said. \u201cThis is one of the most vicious forms of neocolonial oppression that is taking over the world at the moment \u2013 and to address this book in this way and to recognise it and draw attention to the narrative it is presenting will have repercussions for many generations to come.\u201d The awards are split into seven categories, which are judged by a panel.

After last year\u2019s Nib prize, it is the second people\u2019s choice award for the debut, a memoir that tracks Lee\u2019s journey from being a judge\u2019s associate to seeking justice through the courts for childhood sexual assault. She now receives \u201chundreds\u201d of emails and messages from other sexual abuse survivors. \u201cI respond to everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cOverall I get enough messages of such hope and optimism, and people just actually make life-changing decisions after reading this book, so even though I also get a lot of upsetting messages it all comes good. All I can hope for as a writer is to reach people in some way.\u201d Lee said the unexpected commercial success of the book had given her \u201cthe most wonderful gift of freedom to write what I want next\u201d. She is currently working on a series of essays. The young adult prize was won by Amelin and Ezekiel Kwaymullina, for Catching Teller Crow. Western Australian author Kim Scott, a dual Miles Franklin award winner, won the prize for Indigenous writing for his novel Taboo, which deals with a modern community coming to terms with the historical and cultural legacy of a massacre on Noongar country in south-west WA. It is based on an experience in his own country at Ravensthorpe, halfway between Albany and Esperance. \u201cMy ancestral country is regarded as taboo by many Aboriginal people because of the killing that happened there in the late 19th century,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know about it until I was an adult, that nasty edge to our history \u2026 the emotional infrastructure of the times didn\u2019t enable or perhaps allow it.\u201d Scott said the novel was for \u201ca lot of us who have been damaged by colonisation, and I would imagine that\u2019s non-Aboriginal people as well ... healing and strengthening our relationship to pre-colonial heritage. \u201cIt\u2019s all about foundations and being grounded ... and finding a way for an emotional and spiritual infrastructure.

      "body": "<p>A spate of deaths has rocked the homeless community in Oxford, sparking warnings that a lack of housing and support for people with mental health and addiction problems in one of Britain\u2019s most affluent cities is contributing to fatalities.</p> <p>Bereaved friends of three men and a woman who have died suddenly in the university city since November said the losses are the worst they have known. They fear further deaths among rough sleepers amid freezing temperatures.</p> <p>The latest came on 21 January when Sharron Maasz, 44, a drug-addicted mother and grandmother, died in an intermediate home after a long period sleeping rough and a spell in hospital.</p> <p>The deaths have deeply upset Oxford\u2019s growing community of rough sleepers, many of whom claimed this week that highly vulnerable people are being left with insufficient support even when they are given beds.</p> <p>On 2 December Aron Gibson, 37, died in the McDonald\u2019s on Cornmarket Street, the main shopping street, on a Sunday evening, reportedly when an attempt to inject drugs into his groin went wrong. Four days later a Polish gardener, Czeslaw Mazak, 36, who slept rough and often without a tent, was found dead near a city centre nightclub on 6 December. A friend said he was \u201cproud\u201d and had refused offers of shelter. Simon, a man in his 50s, died shortly after moving from the city\u2019s main homeless hostel into shared housing, friends said.</p> <p>\u201cI knew Sharon, Simon, Chester [as Czeslaw was known locally] and Aron,\u201d said Tom Cash, 53, a Big Issue seller. \u201cIt hurts me. Aron was buried and no one knew it. It was like he was John Doe. I would have liked to have gone.\u201d</p> <p>Monica Gregory, a formerly homeless woman who volunteers to support rough sleepers in her city, said: \u201cI am worried about who is going to be next. This is the worst I have seen it in Oxford.\u201d</p> <p>The spate of deaths emerged on the eve of the government\u2019s latest annual count of rough sleepers in England and Wales, which rose 15% to 4,751 rough sleepers in 2017. Councils and homeless campaigners are expecting it to rise again. A total of 597 people sleeping rough or in emergency accommodation were estimated to have died last year in England and Wales, a 24% increase from 2013.</p> <p>In 2017 Oxford recorded the highest average house prices in the country compared with local earnings, but the city\u2019s 56-bed main homeless hostel is full and up to 35 people also sleep on the floor on the coldest nights. Five tents are pitched a few yards from its front door.

      "bodyText": "A spate of deaths has rocked the homeless community in Oxford, sparking warnings that a lack of housing and support for people with mental health and addiction problems in one of Britain\u2019s most affluent cities is contributing to fatalities. Bereaved friends of three men and a woman who have died suddenly in the university city since November said the losses are the worst they have known. They fear further deaths among rough sleepers amid freezing temperatures. The latest came on 21 January when Sharron Maasz, 44, a drug-addicted mother and grandmother, died in an intermediate home after a long period sleeping rough and a spell in hospital. The deaths have deeply upset Oxford\u2019s growing community of rough sleepers, many of whom claimed this week that highly vulnerable people are being left with insufficient support even when they are given beds. On 2 December Aron Gibson, 37, died in the McDonald\u2019s on Cornmarket Street, the main shopping street, on a Sunday evening, reportedly when an attempt to inject drugs into his groin went wrong. Four days later a Polish gardener, Czeslaw Mazak, 36, who slept rough and often without a tent, was found dead near a city centre nightclub on 6 December. A friend said he was \u201cproud\u201d and had refused offers of shelter. Simon, a man in his 50s, died shortly after moving from the city\u2019s main homeless hostel into shared housing, friends said. \u201cI knew Sharon, Simon, Chester [as Czeslaw was known locally] and Aron,\u201d said Tom Cash, 53, a Big Issue seller. \u201cIt hurts me. Aron was buried and no one knew it. It was like he was John Doe. I would have liked to have gone.\u201d Monica Gregory, a formerly homeless woman who volunteers to support rough sleepers in her city, said: \u201cI am worried about who is going to be next. This is the worst I have seen it in Oxford.\u201d The spate of deaths emerged on the eve of the government\u2019s latest annual count of rough sleepers in England and Wales, which rose 15% to 4,751 rough sleepers in 2017. Councils and homeless campaigners are expecting it to rise again. A total of 597 people sleeping rough or in emergency accommodation were estimated to have died last year in England and Wales, a 24% increase from 2013. In 2017 Oxford recorded the highest average house prices in the country compared with local earnings, but the city\u2019s 56-bed main homeless hostel is full and up to 35 people also sleep on the floor on the coldest nights. Five tents are pitched a few yards from its front door. Another 61-room hostel was demolished this year to make way for conventional housing. \u201cThese deaths impact everyone,\u201d said the Oxford city councillor Shaista Aziz. \u201cHomelessness is a national humanitarian emergency and we are seeing its daily implications in our city.\u201d Estimated rough sleeping per capita is higher in England only in Brighton, Bedford, Luton, Westminster and Camden and has risen more than tenfold since 2011 from eight to 89 in 2018. Linda Smith, the deputy leader of Oxford city council, said: \u201cEvery death of a rough sleeper is a death too many \u2026 Homelessness kills and the best way to help a rough sleeper is to get them to come inside where they can get the accommodation and support they need to rebuild their lives away from the streets.\u201d However, Maasz died in interim housing funded through the council. Wrapped in blankets two doors along from the McDonald\u2019s where Gibson died, Kaz, 61, broke down when she remembered her \u201cbest mate\u201d Sharron. \u201cThere was no need for it,\u201d she said. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t have been left alone. All the girls need support, all the lads too.\u201d On Wednesday, Oxford\u2019s senior coroner, Darren Salter, opened an inquest into Maasz\u2019s death. He said she died in her accommodation on Botley Road in west Oxford and pending toxicology, items at the scene suggest her death was drug-related. Only five months ago Maasz told the Guardian: \u201cI just want to get my life sorted. I want to put a lid on all the chaos. I\u2019ve always wanted to get clean, but it\u2019s not as simple as that if you\u2019ve got mental health issues and you\u2019re living like this, being pushed from pillar to post.\u201d After that she was in hospital for about eight weeks with an infection caused by needle use which required an operation. \u201cShe could hardly walk,\u201d said Gregory. \u201cShe used to ride a bike to keep the pressure off her leg.

      "body": "<p>Whatever happened to \u201cNew Atheism\u201d? It was born in the febrile aftermath of 9/11, when belief in a deity \u2013 or, let\u2019s be honest, specifically in Allah \u2013 seemed to some people a newly urgent danger to western civilisation. Sam Harris began writing <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2005/feb/06/society\" title=\"\">The End of Faith </a></em>(2004) immediately after the World Trade Center attacks, and it became a bestseller. There followed the philosopher Daniel Dennett\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/feb/25/highereducation.news3\" title=\"\">Breaking the Spell</a></em>, Richard Dawkins\u2019s <em><a href=\" https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/23/scienceandnature.richarddawkins\" title=\"\">The God Delusion</a></em>, and Christopher Hitchens\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/01/society2\" title=\"\">God Is Not Great</a></em>. The men toured vigorously, but they all met together only once, and this book is the transcript of what ensued, with new brief introductions by the surviving members, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/16/christopher-hitchens-obituary\" title=\"\">Hitchens having died</a> in 2011. Contrary to the book\u2019s subtitle, the \u201catheist revolution\u201d was not sparked by this cocktail-fuelled pre-dinner round of chat and backslapping, which took place in 2007. By then the participants could already salute one another for the impressive sales of their books, boast about how willing they were to cause \u201coffence\u201d, and reminisce about how brilliant they were when they befuddled this or that bishop with some debating point.</p> <p>In many ways the conversation already seems dated in its political preoccupations, particularly in the idea proffered by Hitchens that \u201choly war\u201d was the greatest existential threat to civilisation. (There had been nothing holy about the cold war, which brought us closest to the brink of planetary Armageddon, and North Korea now is not a theocracy, but never mind.) \u201cI think it\u2019s us, plus the 82nd Airborne and the 101st, who are the real fighters for secularism at the moment, the ones who are really fighting the main enemy,\u201d Hitchens announces with armchair-general relish. (The 82nd and 101st operated in Iraq and Afghanistan.) The other Horsemen agree eagerly that they are all very brave. In his introduction, Dawkins insists that \u201cthe atheistic worldview has an unsung virtue of intellectual courage\u201d, which might indeed be unsung had not its adherents themselves been singing it for so long.</p> <p>New Atheism\u2019s arguments were never very sophisticated or historically informed. You will find in this conversation no acknowledgment of the progress made by medieval Islamic civilisation in medicine and mathematics \u2013 which is why, among other things, we have the word \u201calgebra\u201d. The Horsemen assume that religion has always been an impediment to science, dismissing famous religious scientists \u2013 such as Georges Lema\u00eetre, the Catholic priest who first proposed the big bang hypothesis, not to mention Isaac Newton et al \u2013 as inexplicable outliers. At one point Harris complains about a leading geneticist who is also a Christian. This guy seems to think, Harris spits incredulously, \u201cthat on Sunday you can kneel down in the dewy grass and give yourself to Jesus because you\u2019re in the presence of a frozen waterfall, and on Monday you can be a physical geneticist\u201d. Harris offers no reason why he can\u2019t, except that the combination is incompatible with his own narrow-mindedness.</p> <p>For these men, rationality is all on \u201cour\u201d side and evidence-free faith is all on \u201ctheir\u201d side. But faith is very much a movable feast: Hitchens himself, in his sad late persona as a useful idiot for the Bush-Cheney regime in the mid-2000s, notably kept insisting \u2013 in the face of no evidence \u2013 that Saddam Hussein had possessed a working nuclear-weapons programme, which proved that it had been right all along to invade Iraq.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>What did they all do next? Dennett returned to questions of philosophy while Dawkins became a leading social-media troll</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For all that, Hitchens is plainly the most cultured thinker at the table. Without religion, would we have had the music of Bach or the paintings of Michelangelo? He\u2019s not sure: \u201cI can\u2019t hear myself saying, \u2018If only you had a secular painter, he would have done work just as good.\u2019\u201d Dawkins is more blusteringly confident: \u201cWhat? That Michelangelo, if he\u2019d been commissioned to do the ceiling of a museum of science, wouldn\u2019t have produced something just as wonderful?\u201d A museum of science! At another point Dawkins reassures everyone: \u201cI have not the slightest problem with Christmas trees.\u201d</p> <p>Dennett, for his part, plays along with the tribalism \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let you play the faith card,\u201d he says gamely \u2013 but you suspect his heart\u2019s not really in it. In his introduction he reveals a more humane attitude \u2013 \u201cI have known people whose lives would be desolate and friendless,\u201d he writes, \u201cif it weren\u2019t for the non-judgmental welcome they have received in one religious organisation or another\u201d \u2013 which explains why he was only ever really a semi-detached Horseman.</p> <p>What did they all do next? Dennett let the subject lie and returned to questions of evolution and philosophy, most recently with his excellent 2017 book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/02/from-bacteria-to-bach-and-back-by-daniel-c-dennett-review\" title=\"\">From Bacteria to Bach and Back</a></em>. Dawkins became a leading social-media troll, with tweets such as this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/1018933359978909696\" title=\"\">from last summer</a>: \u201cListening to the lovely bells of Winchester, one of our great mediaeval cathedrals. So much nicer than the aggressive-sounding \u2018Allahu Akhbar.\u2019 Or is that just my cultural upbringing?\u201d In his introduction, Dawkins quotes some scriptural interpretation and asks: \u201cAre professors of theology really paid to do this kind of thing?\u201d, which suggests he has a bright future ahead of him leaving pointless online comments below newspaper articles.</p> <p>The intellectual path followed by Harris is most balefully illustrative of the poisonous seeds that were always present in New Atheism. At one point here, the men admire themselves for their willingness to consider truths that might be politically dangerous. For instance, Hitchens says, if the notorious hypothesis of the 1994 book by Richard J Herrnstein and Charles Murray, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/06/bell-curve-author-charles-murray-speaks-out-after-speech-cut-short-by-protests\" title=\"\">The Bell Curve</a></em> \u2013 that black people are genetically inferior in intelligence to white people \u2013 were true, it shouldn\u2019t be ignored. Luckily, Hitchens hastens to add, that example is not viable. Later on, however, Harris brings up the argument again. \u201cIf there were reliable differences in intelligence between races or genders,\u201d he begins, before Hitchens cuts him off dismissively. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think any of us here do think that that\u2019s the case.\u201d</p> <p>Hitchens might have been too generous. In 2018, Harris caused a storm by inviting Murray on to his podcast for a weirdly uncritical two-hour conversation. Murray, Harris claimed, had been the victim of a terrible \u201cacademic injustice\u201d for the way in which his notions about the inherent cognitive inferiority of some \u201craces\u201d had been rejected by the scientific establishment. (Lest you worry about Murray, be reassured that he is still a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, which is funded by the ultra-conservative billionaire Koch brothers.)</p> <p>This is where the preeningly fearless insistence on entertaining uncomfortable questions can so easily lead. Harris ended up in the company of the \u201calt-right\u201d and the so-called \u201cintellectual dark web\u201d, populated by people who portray themselves as valiant enough to say what you\u2019re not allowed to say any more, and are constantly invited on rightwing talk shows to say it. For some, New Atheism was never about God at all, but just a topical subgenre of the rightwing backlash against the supposedly suffocating atmosphere of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d. In its messianic conviction that it alone serves the cause of truth, this too is a faith as noxious as any other.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Four Horsemen is published by Bantam.

At one point Harris complains about a leading geneticist who is also a Christian. This guy seems to think, Harris spits incredulously, \u201cthat on Sunday you can kneel down in the dewy grass and give yourself to Jesus because you\u2019re in the presence of a frozen waterfall, and on Monday you can be a physical geneticist\u201d. Harris offers no reason why he can\u2019t, except that the combination is incompatible with his own narrow-mindedness. For these men, rationality is all on \u201cour\u201d side and evidence-free faith is all on \u201ctheir\u201d side. But faith is very much a movable feast: Hitchens himself, in his sad late persona as a useful idiot for the Bush-Cheney regime in the mid-2000s, notably kept insisting \u2013 in the face of no evidence \u2013 that Saddam Hussein had possessed a working nuclear-weapons programme, which proved that it had been right all along to invade Iraq. For all that, Hitchens is plainly the most cultured thinker at the table. Without religion, would we have had the music of Bach or the paintings of Michelangelo? He\u2019s not sure: \u201cI can\u2019t hear myself saying, \u2018If only you had a secular painter, he would have done work just as good.\u2019\u201d Dawkins is more blusteringly confident: \u201cWhat? That Michelangelo, if he\u2019d been commissioned to do the ceiling of a museum of science, wouldn\u2019t have produced something just as wonderful?\u201d A museum of science! At another point Dawkins reassures everyone: \u201cI have not the slightest problem with Christmas trees.\u201d Dennett, for his part, plays along with the tribalism \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let you play the faith card,\u201d he says gamely \u2013 but you suspect his heart\u2019s not really in it. In his introduction he reveals a more humane attitude \u2013 \u201cI have known people whose lives would be desolate and friendless,\u201d he writes, \u201cif it weren\u2019t for the non-judgmental welcome they have received in one religious organisation or another\u201d \u2013 which explains why he was only ever really a semi-detached Horseman. What did they all do next? Dennett let the subject lie and returned to questions of evolution and philosophy, most recently with his excellent 2017 book From Bacteria to Bach and Back. Dawkins became a leading social-media troll, with tweets such as this from last summer: \u201cListening to the lovely bells of Winchester, one of our great mediaeval cathedrals. So much nicer than the aggressive-sounding \u2018Allahu Akhbar.\u2019 Or is that just my cultural upbringing?\u201d In his introduction, Dawkins quotes some scriptural interpretation and asks: \u201cAre professors of theology really paid to do this kind of thing?\u201d, which suggests he has a bright future ahead of him leaving pointless online comments below newspaper articles. The intellectual path followed by Harris is most balefully illustrative of the poisonous seeds that were always present in New Atheism. At one point here, the men admire themselves for their willingness to consider truths that might be politically dangerous. For instance, Hitchens says, if the notorious hypothesis of the 1994 book by Richard J Herrnstein and Charles Murray, The Bell Curve \u2013 that black people are genetically inferior in intelligence to white people \u2013 were true, it shouldn\u2019t be ignored. Luckily, Hitchens hastens to add, that example is not viable. Later on, however, Harris brings up the argument again. \u201cIf there were reliable differences in intelligence between races or genders,\u201d he begins, before Hitchens cuts him off dismissively. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think any of us here do think that that\u2019s the case.\u201d Hitchens might have been too generous. In 2018, Harris caused a storm by inviting Murray on to his podcast for a weirdly uncritical two-hour conversation. Murray, Harris claimed, had been the victim of a terrible \u201cacademic injustice\u201d for the way in which his notions about the inherent cognitive inferiority of some \u201craces\u201d had been rejected by the scientific establishment. (Lest you worry about Murray, be reassured that he is still a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, which is funded by the ultra-conservative billionaire Koch brothers.) This is where the preeningly fearless insistence on entertaining uncomfortable questions can so easily lead. Harris ended up in the company of the \u201calt-right\u201d and the so-called \u201cintellectual dark web\u201d, populated by people who portray themselves as valiant enough to say what you\u2019re not allowed to say any more, and are constantly invited on rightwing talk shows to say it. For some, New Atheism was never about God at all, but just a topical subgenre of the rightwing backlash against the supposedly suffocating atmosphere of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d. In its messianic conviction that it alone serves the cause of truth, this too is a faith as noxious as any other. \u2022 The Four Horsemen is published by Bantam.

Wineglasses were broken or missing, wine stained the floorboards, the vacuum cleaner was broken and stank of cannabis and there was some stuck to a chair cushion. A neighbour said a number of young people had been coming and going over the two days. Airbnb claimed it could not contact the guest as she\u2019d closed her profile. If it doesn\u2019t provide the host with compensation and enforce a fine, where is my security as a host? LT, London Satisfying as it would be to fine delinquent guests, private companies do not have the power to do so. However, the host guarantee promises cover for up to $1m for damage to property, although there are a raft of exclusions including that caused by pets or guests who overstay, excessive use of utilities and damage to communal areas. Beware, though. This is not an insurance policy. Indeed, renting your room without informing your insurer could invalidate your policy and, if you do inform them, it\u2019s likely your premium will rise or the insurer will refuse to cover the risk. None of that excuses Airbnb\u2019s silence when you sent the evidence. When the Observer wades in it says: \u201cWe apologise for our delay in supporting this host and are reaching out to make things right.\u201d That translates as \u00a3300. You are asking for \u00a3789 to reflect the extra cleaning, the extra guests and compensation because the flat could not be let until you had rectified the damage. But the guarantee only includes physical loss and damage. If you let your flat regularly you should consider getting a comprehensive insurance cover from a specialised broker to fill in the many gaps of the free guarantee.

The latter presents a conventional heroic narrative, with the player-characters unambiguously coded as righteous saviours who must eradicate the evil represented by the zombies to restore symbolic order. In Silent Hill, originally billed as psychological horror, the roles are muddier. Lead character Harry Mason is a normal guy, frightened and disoriented by the accident: he gets breathless after running short distances, and the weapon-aiming mechanic is awkward and inaccurate, to symbolise his inexperience.

He is a former president who is treated with honor and gravitas. On the question of his slave-owning, we hear that phrase that always grates my ears: he was a man of his time. It is supposed to quiet all interrogation of evil. But we are all people of our time. And we live the layers of those glib justifications; they are baked into the national pie. They shape our doings. So it goes with Madison.</p> <p>Some readers will further say: Madison recognized the evils of slavery! He did. He wrote in his papers, \u201cWhere slavery exists, the republican theory becomes still more fallacious.\u201d And yet he explained that the enslaved, being of a mixed character \u2013 between property and person \u2013 ought to count as three-fifths for congressional apportionment.</p> <p>The strategic argument of Federalist 54 was political. It was a middle ground between the interests of southern planters and their peers: citizens who were not slaveholders nor supported primarily by a slave economy.

Our history is a trail of tears shrouded in myth. Barely an icon can be named without some vile commitments or deeds. That is the price of empire. And yes, it bears repeating: Madison knew slavery was bad, a stain upon the principle of liberty. So much so that the one bondsman he freed was the one he took to the constitutional convention. He was a 24-year-old man named Billey, who had been given to Madison when he was eight. Something happened between the two at the convention, in the midst of all that talk of freedom. Madison did not bring him back to Virginia. He said Billey was no longer fit to be among his fellow slaves because his mind was \u201ctoo thoroughly tainted\u201d. Billey had grown, according to Madison, to \u201ccovet liberty\u201d. And while he couldn\u2019t blame him, he couldn\u2019t run the risk of his other chattel being infected with such hopes.</p> <p>Of course, Madison was wrong.

In so many ways, Black people remain partial members or partial citizens, along with the many \u201cothers\u201d who were kept and cast out.

The protest came after police officials frustrated at the apparent impunity of the military shared more than a dozen investigation reports with the Guardian that suggest soldiers have been responsible for murder, rape and armed robbery. Scores of women and girls say they have been raped over the past two weeks by army officials who have ransacked houses in the high density suburbs of Harare, ostensibly in search of protesters accused of destroying property during a three-day shutdown called by unions a fortnight ago. A dozen people were shot dead and a further 78 reportedly treated for gunshot wounds in the violent protests, which were triggered by a 150% increase in fuel prices. According to human rights defenders, many victims of rape are choosing to recover at home in fear of retribution from state agents. Grisly reports of rape and sexual assault have been reported across the country since the unrest began. Human rights lawyers say women who have been raped are afraid to seek medical treatment from public hospitals. Women have also been subjected to humiliating beatings on the buttocks, thighs and breasts during the current crackdown. A mother of three who says she was raped in Southlea Park, a poor community on the outskirts of Harare, said: \u201cOne of the soldiers said I should comply with everything that they wanted to do with me. I didn\u2019t refuse, because I wanted to save my children. I told them I was HIV positive but one of them said it didn\u2019t matter, so I complied.\u201d Walpe said it was difficult to identify perpetrators of sexual assault because they wear masks and balaclavas. \u201cWe are calling on all women who have been abused by uniformed forces to report to independent bodies,\u201d Walpe said. Doug Coltart, a human rights lawyer, said rape victims were living in fear and could not report perpetrators, while the police refuse to investigate. Coltart said: \u201cThe continued beatings, rape and abductions by the military are totally unlawful. There have been multiple instances where women have gone to the police to report rape, saying it was committed by soldiers, and the police don\u2019t want to be involved. A lot of women don\u2019t feel safe going to the police. It\u2019s a small percentage of rape victims who are reporting.\u201d Soldiers have remained on the streets while a crackdown has continued in Harare\u2019s high-density areas, where most rape cases have been reported. Walpe said it feared for disabled women who cannot defend themselves. Army officials have denied involvement in the alleged abuse, blaming rogue soldiers and army deserters. The Black Wednesday protest comes a day after lawyers also took to the streets, demanding a return to the rule of law and fair trials for the hundreds of protesters currently in detention.",

      "bodyText": "Campaigners for British nationals settled in the EU have called on Theresa May to guarantee health cover payments for pensioners for at least two years to help secure wider residential rights as well as medical care in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The government has indicated that it is in advanced conversations with countries including Spain, France and Ireland about continuing reciprocal arrangements, which would kick in to place if the UK crashes out of the EU. Currently pensioners who have retired in the EU can get treatment reimbursed in full or part by the NHS under a reciprocal arrangement involving what is known as an S1 certificate. But the campaign group British in Europe says the government needs to make unilateral pledges to extend the S1 beyond 29 March for all 1 million Britons in all EU states irrespective of the bilateral talks. It says the promise of a bilateral agreement is too low a threshold to give legal comfort and that there is concern that UK nationals will be required to have health insurance in order to qualify to remain in some countries as third-country nationals. \u201cIf there is no deal British in Europe calls upon Theresa May and [health secretary] Matt Hancock to guarantee to pay unilaterally for pensioners\u2019 medical treatment under the S1 scheme until it is replaced by bilateral agreements,\u201d said Jeremy Morgan, the campaign group\u2019s spokesman on health issues. \u201cIt is not just a question of the affordability of treatment.

Just think of the impact of this on a 75-year-old in the middle of vital cancer treatment on 30 March,\u201d said Morgan. The Department of Health and Social Care said it was in advanced talks with Spain, where 67,000 British pensioners live, and France, where 45,000 are settled, over reciprocal arrangements for healthcare and it was confident deals would sealed. A DHSC spokeswoman said: \u201cOur priority is to ensure UK nationals living or working in the EU can continue to access the healthcare they need as we exit the EU.

The 2020 Tokyo Olympics organising committee had initially planned to allow up to 5,000 people to watch the sailing events off Enoshima island, just south of the Japanese capital, according to the public broadcaster NHK. They lowered the number to 3,300, however, after discussing tsunami evacuation measures with local authorities, NHK added. Japan is one of the most seismically active countries in the world. Its Pacific coast, where the sailing events will take place, is susceptible to powerful tsunamis triggered by earthquakes. In less than two months\u2019 time the country will mark the eighth anniversary of the March 2011 triple disaster, in which more than 18,000 people were killed by a huge tsunami along the north-east coast. While there is disagreement on the likelihood of Tokyo being struck by a destructive earthquake in the foreseeable future, government experts believe there is a high probability of a major earthquake occurring in the Tokyo metropolitan area within the next 30 years. A powerful offshore quake could trigger a large tsunami that would reach the shore within minutes, NHK said, citing government projections. The decision to cut spectator numbers at Enoshima is not the only adjustment organisers of the Olympics, which will run from 24 July to 9 August 2020, have had to make in view of Japan\u2019s vulnerability to powerful natural forces and extreme weather. The Yomiuri Shimbun reported last week that organisers had decided to shift the start time for the men\u2019s and women\u2019s marathons to 6am \u2013 an hour-and-a-half earlier than originally planned \u2013 to avoid the health risk to runners and spectators from the intense heat later in the day. The men\u2019s 50km walk will start two hours earlier, at 5.30am, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the Games.

On Thursday the church issued a statement confirming Herft is being investigated by the Episcopal Standards Commission, the Anglican body for dealing with allegations about bishops. \u201cThe Episcopal Standards Commission is investigating the many issues which arise from the information it has received. It will determine its course of action as soon as it can,\u201d a church spokesman said. Herft\u2019s conduct while he was the bishop of Newcastle between May 1993 and February 2005 was scrutinised by the child sexual abuse royal commission, which delivered its final report in December 2017. It comes almost three years after Herft gave evidence to the royal commission that while he understood matters of child abuse should be reported to the police, he believed he was only obliged to report when he received a complaint of substance, and if he knew the name of the complainant. \u201cBishop Herft also gave evidence that before 2002, if someone made an allegation of child sexual abuse and would not put the allegation in writing, the diocese would take no further action,\u201d the royal commission report said. \u201cIn hindsight, he accepted that this left children at risk and was \u2018totally unacceptable\u2019.\u201d Herft retired from his position as archbishop of Perth one year ahead of schedule in 2016, after giving evidence to the royal commission and admitting he \u201clet down the survivors in a way that remorse itself is a very poor emotion to express\u201d. The church said it was making its investigation into Herft public in line with internal protocols, \u201cbut those protocols strictly limit the information it can release before any finding is made\u201d.

Privately, Liberal party members have expressed concern over party membership drops, which were exacerbated by the August leadership spill, which saw Malcolm Turnbull toppled as prime minister. Most recently, Morrison\u2019s decision to overturn the Gilmore branch preselection and parachute former Labor party president Warren Mundine into the seat also ruffled branch membership feathers, given branch democracy is considered a key Liberal party tenet. Dumped candidate Grant Schultz responded by quitting the party and vowing to run as an independent in the marginal seat. \u201cI can no longer be a member of a party that does not support democracy, or act with integrity,\u201d he said earlier this month. Political parties keep membership numbers close to their chest but the Liberal party has previously expressed concern over being unable to compete with Labor when it comes to volunteers to man voting booths and campaigns, given Labor\u2019s links to the union movement. It is not the first time a political party has responded to internal turmoil and a downturn in fortunes with a plea to the former party faithful. When Queensland Labor was reduced to seven MPs in the wake of the 2012 state election, party membership was lowered to $5 in a bid to win back support. While Liberal party sources said membership in NSW had increased since Morrison took over the leadership, it is not just the federal election the state branch has to contend with, with the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, also seeking re-election in March.

The party leaders held a 45-minute meeting that was described as \u201cserious and engaged\u201d by Labour. Its spokesman added that May was \u201cinterested in exploring the details\u201d of Labour\u2019s Brexit proposals which centre on a permanent customs union.</p> \n<p>May opposes a customs union and Downing Street said that while May asked Corbyn questions, her underlying position had not shifted. Many in Westminster believe the PM could yet be pushed in the direction of a customs union and some Tory Brexiters have hinted they might back it if the backstop goes. The two party leaders will meet again soon, most likely within days.</p> \n<p>The PM meanwhile has asked ministers to consult Labour backbenchers over legislation to protect workers\u2019 rights after Brexit. Downing Street hopes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/30/government-looks-to-exploit-labour-divisions-over-brexit\">persuade a handful of pro-Brexit Labour MPs</a> to support any final deal May brings back to parliament, partly because she needs their votes to offset diehard Conservative MPs who will not support any deal with the EU. And in debate over post-Brexit immigration rules for EU workers, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley has mocked the idea that they should have to earn \u00a330,000 a year to qualify, saying that as a result of joining parliament \u201cI have met many people who earn way more than \u00a330,000 and have literally no discernible skills, not even one\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"054e6c87-eecb-46c6-a2ab-87f8bb38c257\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bPjdnMF3C-s?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Hackers \u2018leaked Mueller files\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Evidence<strong> </strong>from the Trump-Russia inquiry that was shared confidentially with lawyers for indicted Russian hackers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/30/mueller-evidence-leaked-online-russians\">ended up being posted online</a>, US prosecutors say. Special counsel Robert Mueller has disclosed the leak as part of his prosecution of Concord Management and Consulting, a Russian company that allegedly funded hacking operations by Moscow\u2019s notorious Internet Research Agency (IRA). \u201cIrrelevant\u201d files were selectively shared on the internet to make it look like there was no evidence of substance against the IRA, said a court filing by Mueller\u2019s investigators.

A breach could result in up to two years\u2019 jail. Separately the Home Office has announced \u00a3500,000 to help prosecute retailers who repeatedly sell knives to under-18s.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Leaders hold \u2018serious and engaged\u2019 meeting Hello, it\u2019s Warren Murray keeping you duly informed this Thursday morning. Theresa May has met with Jeremy Corbyn as she comes under pressure to spell out what changes to the Irish backstop she thinks she can wring out of a deeply reluctant Brussels. The party leaders held a 45-minute meeting that was described as \u201cserious and engaged\u201d by Labour. Its spokesman added that May was \u201cinterested in exploring the details\u201d of Labour\u2019s Brexit proposals which centre on a permanent customs union. May opposes a customs union and Downing Street said that while May asked Corbyn questions, her underlying position had not shifted. Many in Westminster believe the PM could yet be pushed in the direction of a customs union and some Tory Brexiters have hinted they might back it if the backstop goes. The two party leaders will meet again soon, most likely within days. The PM meanwhile has asked ministers to consult Labour backbenchers over legislation to protect workers\u2019 rights after Brexit. Downing Street hopes to persuade a handful of pro-Brexit Labour MPs to support any final deal May brings back to parliament, partly because she needs their votes to offset diehard Conservative MPs who will not support any deal with the EU. And in debate over post-Brexit immigration rules for EU workers, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley has mocked the idea that they should have to earn \u00a330,000 a year to qualify, saying that as a result of joining parliament \u201cI have met many people who earn way more than \u00a330,000 and have literally no discernible skills, not even one\u201d. * * * Hackers \u2018leaked Mueller files\u2019 \u2013 Evidence from the Trump-Russia inquiry that was shared confidentially with lawyers for indicted Russian hackers ended up being posted online, US prosecutors say. Special counsel Robert Mueller has disclosed the leak as part of his prosecution of Concord Management and Consulting, a Russian company that allegedly funded hacking operations by Moscow\u2019s notorious Internet Research Agency (IRA). \u201cIrrelevant\u201d files were selectively shared on the internet to make it look like there was no evidence of substance against the IRA, said a court filing by Mueller\u2019s investigators. They are arguing that lawyers for Concord should not be given access to further \u201csensitive\u201d evidence. * * * Blitz on knife crime \u2013 Asbo-style orders against knife offenders have been unveiled by the government. An order can be issued to anyone aged 12 or over believed by police to routinely carry a blade. A breach could result in up to two years\u2019 jail. Separately the Home Office has announced \u00a3500,000 to help prosecute retailers who repeatedly sell knives to under-18s. It is believed that at least one large knife was used during the attack that killed Nedim Bilgin, 17, on Caledonian Road, London, on Tuesday night. An 18-year-old has been arrested on suspicion of murder, and two others aged 16 and 17 were questioned by homicide detectives yesterday. Police are waiting for tests to confirm whether knives recovered from the scene were used in the attack. * * * Deep freeze \u2013 At least eight deaths have been linked to the \u201cpolar vortex\u201d weather system that has brought record-low temperatures across much of the US midwest. Temperatures in Chicago dropped to a low of around -30C on Wednesday, slightly above the city\u2019s lowest-ever reading from January 1985. Many cities opened \u201cwarming shelters\u201d in government buildings, churches, high schools and charities, while schools have been closed, thousands of flights cancelled, rail services suspended, and trucks banned from interstate highways due to icy conditions. The vortex is caused by extremely cold air rushing south from the Arctic. * * * \u2018Not good enough\u2019 \u2013 Facebook and Twitter may be forced to share data to help researchers identify potential risks to young people\u2019s health, as concern grows over social media\u2019s effects on children\u2019s minds and lives. A committee of MPs has criticised social media companies for refusing to share information that could inform high-quality research. \u201cTheir data, which we give them, is both their most valuable resource and it is the only means by which we can effectively study how these platforms affect users,\u201d said Professor Andrew Przybylski, the director of research at the Oxford Internet Institute. The MPs\u2019 report calls for clear rules against illegal online content and behaviour, and enforcement by Ofcom for breaches by the likes YouTube, Facebook and Google. Facebook has posted a record profit of $6.88bn for the last quarter of 2018 despite a year of scandals, including new revelations it paid teenagers to install an app that harvested data on their activities. * * * Homeless tragedy \u2013 There has been a spate of deaths among rough-sleepers in Oxford. Friends of four men and a woman who have died suddenly in the city since November say the losses are the worst they have known, and further deaths are feared amid freezing temperatures. Oxford has one of England\u2019s highest rough sleeping rate after Brighton, Bedford, Luton, Westminster and Camden. The rate has risen more than tenfold since 2011 from eight to 89 in 2018. The main homeless hostel is full and another has been knocked down. \u201cThese deaths impact everyone,\u201d said the Oxford city councillor Shaista Aziz. \u201cHomelessness is a national humanitarian emergency and we are seeing its daily implications in our city.\u201d * * * Better rail for the north \u2013 A \u00a370bn plan to transform transport links across the north of England has been unveiled. Transports chiefs claim the 30-year road and rail upgrade scheme will cut journey times, boost the economy by \u00a3100bn and \u201cleave a legacy for future generations\u201d including 850,000 jobs. Proposed developments include a new line between Liverpool and the HS2 Manchester spur via Warrington; a new line between Manchester and Leeds via Bradford; and upgrading lines between Leeds and Hull, Sheffield and Hull, and the Hope Valley line between Sheffield and Manchester. Road plans include linking Sheffield and Manchester via a trans-Pennine tunnel. Transport for the North (TfN) says the proposals will bring 1.3 million people within an hour\u2019s train journey from Manchester airport and at least four major cities.

      "body": "<p>Cognac is one of France\u2019s most iconic products, yet little of it is consumed at home: 98% is exported. Authentic cognac can only be produced from a specific region but this vast vineyard stretches <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jun/17/france-road-trip-atlantic-coast-la-rochelle-ile-de-re-cognac\" title=\"\">from the grand town of Cognac itself</a> inland across the Charente region and over to the Atlantic coast. It is a delight to explore, with winemakers, distillers and the famed <em>maisons de n\u00e9goces</em><em> (</em>cognac merchants) open for visits. Most people begin in Cognac with one of the multimedia tours (around \u20ac20) of the likes of Hennessy, Martell or R\u00e9my Martin, all established since the 1700s. Alternatively, many houses and winemaker-distillers in the nearby countryside offer just as interesting (if no-frills) tours for free. Many sites are open all year and from November to 31 March it\u2019s possible to see the distilleries in action.</p> <h2>Bache Gabrielsen</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e76f7aab05dd0d18039b619f5314b236561716b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e76f7aab05dd0d18039b619f5314b236561716b7/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cognac by Bache Gabrielsen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The 90-minute tour of this traditional <em>maison de n\u00e9goce</em> is the perfect introduction to understanding cognac. Find it in Cognac\u2019s backstreets and then stumble into its Dickensian office, with clerks bent over antique sloping desks. Since 1905, the owners have been the Norwegian Bache Gabrielsen family.

Authentic cognac can only be produced from a specific region but this vast vineyard stretches from the grand town of Cognac itself inland across the Charente region and over to the Atlantic coast. It is a delight to explore, with winemakers, distillers and the famed maisons de n\u00e9goces (cognac merchants) open for visits. Most people begin in Cognac with one of the multimedia tours (around \u20ac20) of the likes of Hennessy, Martell or R\u00e9my Martin, all established since the 1700s. Alternatively, many houses and winemaker-distillers in the nearby countryside offer just as interesting (if no-frills) tours for free. Many sites are open all year and from November to 31 March it\u2019s possible to see the distilleries in action. Bache Gabrielsen The 90-minute tour of this traditional maison de n\u00e9goce is the perfect introduction to understanding cognac. Find it in Cognac\u2019s backstreets and then stumble into its Dickensian office, with clerks bent over antique sloping desks. Since 1905, the owners have been the Norwegian Bache Gabrielsen family.

      "body": "<p>On the face of it, 2018 was a good year for female artists. Museums and galleries across the UK staged exhibitions on historic and contemporary female artists, with events that celebrated 100 years since British women won the right to vote. But now that the bunting has been taken down and the suffragette sashes stowed away, will women still get wall space in our public museums? Are they here to stay or will they have to make way for the next fad?</p> <p>It\u2019s certainly true that over the past few years, public museums have begun redressing the gender imbalance in their collections. When Tate Modern opened its major extension in 2016, director Frances Morris made a point of dedicating half of the new gallery space to women artists, increasing the percentage on display across the museum from 17% to 36%. And in 2020, the National Gallery will stage its first solo exhibition on a historic female artist \u2013 the 17th-century Italian baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi.</p> <p>But there is still a long way to go. When the National Gallery acquired <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jul/06/national-gallery-buys-artemisia-gentileschi-masterpiece-for-36m\">Gentileschi\u2019s self-portrait</a> last year, the number of works by female artists in its collection rose from 23 to 24 \u2013 out of more than 2,300 in its archives.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that there has been a shortage of female artists \u2013 there have been hundreds over the centuries.

Invisible in museums, they did not sell well on the art market. In turn, museums did not think it necessary to acquire them, producing a vicious cycle of exclusion. How can this deadlock be broken? It\u2019s not just up to museum directors and curators, but also the museum-going public.</p> <p>Unlike their European and US counterparts, British public museums have free entry to their permanent collections. Over the past decade, public spending on museums has declined by 13%, from \u00a3829m in 2007 to \u00a3720m in 2017. So to keep the doors open, venues increasingly rely on revenue from temporary exhibitions. And they tend to play it safe, putting on shows they think will be popular and profitable. And who can blame them? Museums are in a reciprocal relationship with the public and aim to give them what they want. For this reason, many exhibitions focus on the same small group of artists, often with tenuous themes.

Museums and galleries across the UK staged exhibitions on historic and contemporary female artists, with events that celebrated 100 years since British women won the right to vote. But now that the bunting has been taken down and the suffragette sashes stowed away, will women still get wall space in our public museums? Are they here to stay or will they have to make way for the next fad?

Surveys and studies have previously suggested a link between the use of devices and networking sites and an increase in problems among teenagers and younger children ranging from poor sleep to bullying, mental health issues and grooming. However, high quality research in the area is scarce: among the conundrums that need to be looked at are matters of cause and effect, the size of any impacts, and the importance of the content of material accessed online. According to a report by the Commons science and technology committee on the effects of social media and screen time among young people, companies should be compelled to protect users and legislation was needed to enable access to data for high quality studies to be carried out. The committee noted that the government had failed to commission such research and had instead relied on requesting reviews of existing studies. This was despite a 2017 green paper that set out a consultation process on a UK internet safety strategy. \u201cWe understand [social media companies\u2019] eagerness to protect the privacy of users but sharing data with bona fide researchers is the only way society can truly start to understand the impact, both positive and negative, that social media is having on the modern world,\u201d said Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrat MP who chairs the committee. \u201cDuring our inquiry, we heard that social media companies had openly refused to share data with researchers who are keen to examine patterns of use and their effects.

It also said social media companies, from YouTube to Facebook, and search engines such as Google should be subject to tighter regulations and that the UK regulator Ofcom should be empowered to enforce them. The committee said social media companies needed to do more to verify the age of users and to protect the privacy of those under 18, such as geolocation services being automatically turned off. The report also said personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education in schools should be mandatory and help children address the pitfalls and problems of online activities.

      "bodyText": "Here is the third and \u2013 we have to hope \u2013 the last in a franchise that could be renamed How to Drain Your Dragon. All the fire and lifeblood of this idea has been sucked out and we are left with something bland. The first two films from 2010 and 2014, amiable enough, emerged during the 3D boom and the theme-park-type dragonback ride was an important part of the show. That novelty is now long gone. What we\u2019re left with is screensaver cinema: a swirly succession of pretty pictures and colours. This insipid spectacle has nothing like the strong flavour of Cressida Cowell\u2019s Milliganesque illustrations in her original books. We are back with the Vikings and dragons on Berk Island, led by Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel), who has secret feelings for Astrid (America Ferrera). But now they are menaced by an evil dragon-catcher named Grimmel (F Murray Abraham) who looks a bit like the wicked younger brother of Anton Ego, the pompous food critic in Ratatouille and sounds the tiniest bit like Steve Carell\u2019s Gru, from Despicable Me. When this threat manifests itself, the story takes a slightly arbitrary turn, necessitating a Moses-like plan from Hiccup to lead his people to safety in some promised land or other, a narrative indulgence whose only real function is to defer the inevitable showdown with Grimmel. In the end, we have some Jungle Book-type agonising about whether humans and dragons really can live together. Yet, by this stage, the options of their living together and not living together are equally dull. \u2022 This story was amended on 31 January 2019 to correct the spelling of America Ferrera\u2019s surname.",

Having to make detours to avoid customs and security checks along \u201cbomb alley\u201d \u2013 an atrocity-laden eight-mile stretch of road between Newry and Dundalk \u2013 was as frightening as it was familiar.</p> <p>It still is: to this day there are some back roads in South Armagh that I will not drive on alone after dark. It\u2019s hard to explain to those who have not lived through a conflict that claimed more than 3,500 lives, in a region with a smaller population than most large UK cities, how the border permeated every aspect of our lives.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Backtracking on the backstop is a mistake and a risky one at that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s also hard to explain why the Brexit backstop \u2013 an insurance policy proposed between the EU and the UK to avoid a hard border, and extended to the whole of the UK at the latter\u2019s insistence \u2013 is so critical. As the business editor of the largest media group in Ireland, I can give you chapter and verse about the economic threats a hard or no-deal Brexit poses for the Irish, Northern Irish and British economies. But you know about those already.</p> <p>The reality is that no amount of economic modelling can capture the unquantifiable human and psychological costs of the return of a hard border. Many argue that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/29/tory-brexit-malthouse-compromise-backstop-ireland-border\" title=\"\">technological solutions</a> \u2013 drones and suchlike \u2013 will do the trick. This is farcical: you only eliminate physical checks between two territories separated by a border when they share a customs union and have broad regulatory alignment. Everything else is infrastructure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cc47f1cf8c4a54602c0de87f14f1dd8eaf741a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cc47f1cf8c4a54602c0de87f14f1dd8eaf741a3/0_127_5251_3150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstration by campaign group Border Communities Against Brexit in Newry last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A demonstration by campaign group Border Communities Against Brexit in Newry last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Faith/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a journalist, I have been staggered by the scale and speed at which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/06/the-guardian-view-on-the-brexit-backstop-getting-ireland-wrong-again\" title=\"\">dangerous stereotypes</a> and vituperative tropes \u2013 in some cases barely concealed racism \u2013 surrounding Ireland\u2019s supposed intransigence have resurfaced in the UK\u2019s political and media discourse. This process has been accompanied by astonishment in some quarters that Ireland, arguably England\u2019s oldest colony, is a saboteur, reprobate or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/30/irelands-deputy-pm-simon-coveney-we-will-not-be-threatened\" title=\"\">badly behaved underling</a> for refusing to fall into line with the UK\u2019s demands, if we knew what they were. When the BBC\u2019s John Humphrys, one of the most prominent public broadcasters in Britain, asked Ireland\u2019s Europe minister, Helen McEntee, why \u201cDublin\u201d didn\u2019t just leave the EU and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/26/john-humphrys-suggests-ireland-could-quit-eu-and-join-uk\" title=\"\">throw in their lot with this country</a>\u201d, Ireland uttered a collective gasp of incredulity verging on despair. What\u2019s more alarming is that Anglo-Irish political relations, having warmed to a zenith of sorts in recent years, have plunged into a rapid freeze in a matter of months.</p> <p>I\u2019ve worked hard to understand the rationale of those who voted to leave. But I\u2019m saddened and alarmed at how the lives of those who will be most affected by Brexit have been callously cast aside; how the heartfelt and evidence-basedfears about the border have been mocked and derided. Brexiteers tell us that the customs union and the single market have nothing to do with the Good Friday agreement, the nearly 21-year-old, consent-based international peace deal that placed the constitutional destiny of the divided communities of Northern Ireland \u2013 56% of whom voted to remain in 2016 \u2013 in our own hands. They are wrong.</p> <p>Those who want to tear up the backstop, or feel gleeful at the prospect of no deal, should recall that the first shots of the Troubles were fired at customs posts such as Newry, requiring the RUC, and later the British army, to protect officials, civilians and military alike. These incidents paved the way for the installation of those mammoth watchtowers, helicopter bases and checkpoints \u2013 the hard border \u2013 that blighted our landscape. Just as the first shots were fired over customs posts, it was our membership of the customs union and the single market \u2013 the free movement of goods and people \u2013 that allowed us to tear down the physical borders and begin the task of demolishing the walls in our hearts and minds.</p> <p>Is a return to violence \u2013 the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/20/northern-ireland-police-condemn-reckless-derry-bomb-attack\" title=\"\">car bomb</a> in Derry felt like a terrifying foreshock \u2013 inevitable? Not necessarily. But the return of a border, even one that starts out as soft and virtual, will \u2013 like the customs posts of old \u2013 invite a regulatory and security mission creep that will disrupt lives and livelihoods and prove tempting for some who are intent on taking us back to darker times.</p> <p>It\u2019s a gamble we can\u2019t afford to take. The Brexit backstop \u2013 this fundamental need to avoid a border, rightly articulatedin stark, if belated and obvious terms at Davos <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/25/chaotic-brexit-could-lead-to-uniformed-border-police-says-irish-pm-leo-varadkar\" title=\"\">by the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar</a> \u2013 is about so much more than tariffs and trade. It is about our identity. Brexit tears at the heart of the Good Friday agreement, which allows people like me, a Catholic who grew up in Newry, or a loyalist from east Belfast, to identify as British, Irish or both \u2013 and to celebrate our different allegiances.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/30/irelands-deputy-pm-simon-coveney-we-will-not-be-threatened\">Ireland's deputy PM on backstop: 'We will not be threatened'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I can say, as an Irish woman from Northern Ireland, that I am Irish-British: in another time, I would have been tarred and feathered for saying so. Brexit strips away at those coveted birthrights. A border will force us, once again, to choose sides. As we stare down the barrel of Brexit, Theresa May has opened another front, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/30/may-gamble-pays-off-for-now-but-all-bets-are-off-if-eu-says-no-dice\" title=\"\">securing parliamentary support</a> to reopen the withdrawal agreement and demand significant and legally binding changes to the backstop that she vigorously defended for months.</p> <p>The prime minister may have scored a short-term pyrrhic victory in the internecine wars that have divided her party and the UK parliament. But backtracking on the backstop is a mistake, and a dangerous one at that. Placing party politics and political survival above the peace process is a risk we cannot afford to take.</p> <p>\u2022 Dearbhail McDonald is group business editor, Independent Newspapers (Ireland)</p>",

It\u2019s hard to explain to those who have not lived through a conflict that claimed more than 3,500 lives, in a region with a smaller population than most large UK cities, how the border permeated every aspect of our lives. It\u2019s also hard to explain why the Brexit backstop \u2013 an insurance policy proposed between the EU and the UK to avoid a hard border, and extended to the whole of the UK at the latter\u2019s insistence \u2013 is so critical. As the business editor of the largest media group in Ireland, I can give you chapter and verse about the economic threats a hard or no-deal Brexit poses for the Irish, Northern Irish and British economies. But you know about those already. The reality is that no amount of economic modelling can capture the unquantifiable human and psychological costs of the return of a hard border. Many argue that technological solutions \u2013 drones and suchlike \u2013 will do the trick. This is farcical: you only eliminate physical checks between two territories separated by a border when they share a customs union and have broad regulatory alignment. Everything else is infrastructure. As a journalist, I have been staggered by the scale and speed at which dangerous stereotypes and vituperative tropes \u2013 in some cases barely concealed racism \u2013 surrounding Ireland\u2019s supposed intransigence have resurfaced in the UK\u2019s political and media discourse. This process has been accompanied by astonishment in some quarters that Ireland, arguably England\u2019s oldest colony, is a saboteur, reprobate or badly behaved underling for refusing to fall into line with the UK\u2019s demands, if we knew what they were. When the BBC\u2019s John Humphrys, one of the most prominent public broadcasters in Britain, asked Ireland\u2019s Europe minister, Helen McEntee, why \u201cDublin\u201d didn\u2019t just leave the EU and \u201cthrow in their lot with this country\u201d, Ireland uttered a collective gasp of incredulity verging on despair. What\u2019s more alarming is that Anglo-Irish political relations, having warmed to a zenith of sorts in recent years, have plunged into a rapid freeze in a matter of months. I\u2019ve worked hard to understand the rationale of those who voted to leave. But I\u2019m saddened and alarmed at how the lives of those who will be most affected by Brexit have been callously cast aside; how the heartfelt and evidence-basedfears about the border have been mocked and derided. Brexiteers tell us that the customs union and the single market have nothing to do with the Good Friday agreement, the nearly 21-year-old, consent-based international peace deal that placed the constitutional destiny of the divided communities of Northern Ireland \u2013 56% of whom voted to remain in 2016 \u2013 in our own hands. They are wrong. Those who want to tear up the backstop, or feel gleeful at the prospect of no deal, should recall that the first shots of the Troubles were fired at customs posts such as Newry, requiring the RUC, and later the British army, to protect officials, civilians and military alike. These incidents paved the way for the installation of those mammoth watchtowers, helicopter bases and checkpoints \u2013 the hard border \u2013 that blighted our landscape. Just as the first shots were fired over customs posts, it was our membership of the customs union and the single market \u2013 the free movement of goods and people \u2013 that allowed us to tear down the physical borders and begin the task of demolishing the walls in our hearts and minds. Is a return to violence \u2013 the recent car bomb in Derry felt like a terrifying foreshock \u2013 inevitable? Not necessarily. But the return of a border, even one that starts out as soft and virtual, will \u2013 like the customs posts of old \u2013 invite a regulatory and security mission creep that will disrupt lives and livelihoods and prove tempting for some who are intent on taking us back to darker times. It\u2019s a gamble we can\u2019t afford to take. The Brexit backstop \u2013 this fundamental need to avoid a border, rightly articulatedin stark, if belated and obvious terms at Davos by the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar \u2013 is about so much more than tariffs and trade. It is about our identity. Brexit tears at the heart of the Good Friday agreement, which allows people like me, a Catholic who grew up in Newry, or a loyalist from east Belfast, to identify as British, Irish or both \u2013 and to celebrate our different allegiances. I can say, as an Irish woman from Northern Ireland, that I am Irish-British: in another time, I would have been tarred and feathered for saying so. Brexit strips away at those coveted birthrights. A border will force us, once again, to choose sides. As we stare down the barrel of Brexit, Theresa May has opened another front, securing parliamentary support to reopen the withdrawal agreement and demand significant and legally binding changes to the backstop that she vigorously defended for months. The prime minister may have scored a short-term pyrrhic victory in the internecine wars that have divided her party and the UK parliament. But backtracking on the backstop is a mistake, and a dangerous one at that. Placing party politics and political survival above the peace process is a risk we cannot afford to take. \u2022 Dearbhail McDonald is group business editor, Independent Newspapers (Ireland)",

      "body": "<p>Every Tuesday night, an email newsletter goes out to 13 million subscribers. It\u2019s far more popular than Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/aug/01/gwyneth-paltrow-wellness-industry-quackery-elle-macpherson\" title=\"\">Goop</a> newsletter, which has 8 million, and the New York Times Morning Briefing, with 1.7 million. Its name, Money Saving Expert\u2019s Money Tips, barely hints at the astounding range of tricks and deals contained within. Recent emails have featured \u201chacks\u201d for cheaper meals at Nando\u2019s and McDonald\u2019s, deals on broadband and savings accounts, codes giving discounted access to airport lounges and an offer for free radiator heat-reflector pads.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/feb/15/the-money-saving-expert-how-martin-lewis-became-the-most-trusted-man-in-britain-podcast\">The Money Saving Expert: how Martin Lewis became the most trusted man in Britain \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The newsletter looks like a relic from an earlier age of the internet: thousands of words, with no ads and few images. It began as an email that Martin Lewis \u2013 the personal finance journalist now better known as the Money Saving Expert \u2013 wrote for his friends. Today, it is the work of dozens of people at MoneySavingExpert.com, the website Lewis founded in 2003, which has become one of the 100 most popular sites in the UK, with 16 million visitors a month.</p> <p>The business of saving money has made Lewis extremely wealthy. After he sold the site in 2012 to the price-comparison firm MoneySupermarket <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jun/01/martin-lewis-sells-moneysavingexpert\" title=\"\">for \u00a387m</a>, the Financial Times called him \u201cthe most successful journalist in the world, ever\u201d. A year later, he was the seventh most Googled celebrity in the UK, nestled between Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9.</p> <p>Lewis still worries over every line in the email each week. When I went to meet him on a Tuesday afternoon last July, he was studying the draft of that night\u2019s newsletter, pondering aloud the merits of competing broadband deals. There was a gold piggy bank on his desk. It was the height of the heatwave, and Lewis, who is lean and often tanned, was dressed in the uniform of a sensible dad doing his best to enjoy a long-awaited summer holiday: a short-sleeved, stripy white shirt with a denim collar, denim shorts and the navy Skechers that he wore almost every time I met him.</p> <p>At a time when money has become the measure of everything \u2013 when people often think of themselves as consumers rather than citizens \u2013 Lewis has become the most trusted man in Britain. In 2015, seven months before the EU referendum, <a href=\"https://gqrr.app.box.com/s/8n7hjxa23we3ery6rcrawjstquj11flb\" title=\"\">a poll found</a> that 71% of people trusted him when he talked about Europe, putting him ahead of any other public figure. He has achieved that status through an unusual combination of journalism, campaigning and light entertainment, without falling victim to the public\u2019s suspicion of journalists, campaigners and entertainers.</p> <p>In our age of insecurity, Lewis stands out as a reassuring source of authority. Addressing a country that has never been comfortable talking about money, Lewis takes us by the hand and guides us through the bewildering world of finance. He comes across as a kind of double agent, who goes undercover among the powerful then reports back to the rest of society. It may feel as though banks, corporations and energy companies are lined up against the individual, with few politicians willing to intervene, but Lewis\u2019s work offers the alluring promise that in the battle between business and consumer, you can, with the right information, emerge the victor.</p> <p>Today, at 46, Lewis is a TV personality as much as anything. He appears weekly on Good Morning Britain and This Morning, while his primetime ITV programme, The Martin Lewis Money Show, regularly attracts around 4 million viewers.</p> <p>Lewis\u2019s success depends on the trust he has built with the public, and he tends to this like an anxious parent. Everything featured on Money Saving Expert has been chosen by its editorial team, but once those recommendations have been decided on, the commercial team then tries to arrange deals with the companies offering the products. The site makes a commission when readers click on affiliated links for such products, which are marked with an asterisk. Still, when I joined Lewis for his meeting about the email, he was cautious. He worried that one description was too \u201cselly\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to think we\u2019re advertising,\u201d he said. A fidgety presence, he took great care with the recommendations, mindful of the impact they can have: Tesco Bank\u2019s website once crashed when one of its savings accounts appeared in the email.</p> <p>Lewis applies that same care to his campaigns and public pronouncements. He has based his career on just about the last thing we all have in common: the wish to save money. And he tends not to weigh in on the most contentious issues of the day, for fear of dividing opinion and undermining his sway. He believes he can have the biggest impact on society by changing our relationship to money \u2013 but it has become harder for him to stay out of politics altogether. He even weighed in on the EU referendum, although in an ostentatiously measured manner: \u201cI\u2019m generally risk-averse, and that pushes me just towards an IN vote for safety, maybe 55% to 45%,\u201d <a href=\"https://blog.moneysavingexpert.com/2016/06/how-to-vote-in-the-eu-referendum/\" title=\"\">he wrote</a> on Money Saving Expert. When we spoke recently, Lewis told me: \u201cI have built myself what is currently a unique position in trying to guide people to be better with their finances. And I don\u2019t want to do anything to screw that, to get rid of that trust.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f0e55de4c2be48b66d4d295243ceb76dddb0eda4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0e55de4c2be48b66d4d295243ceb76dddb0eda4/126_292_4477_2687/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Lewis on TV with Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid the morning after the 2016 EU referendum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Lewis on TV with Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid the morning after the 2016 EU referendum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With his fiery rhetoric, his efforts to defend the little guy against vested interests, Lewis may look like a populist. But, at heart, he has a technocratic temperament: he identifies specific problems, and tries to solve them with tweaks. On the rare occasions when he does speak out, it\u2019s because he has decided the system has stopped working properly.</p> <p>Lewis is, in short, a centrist \u2013 perhaps the only truly popular centrist in Britain. Instead of seeking structural change, his formula combines educating the public with campaigning for small adjustments to the system. But at a time of growing inequality, with politicians unwilling or unable to hold corporations to account, is this enough? What is needed, the economist John Kay told me, \u201cis not more information from the financial services industry, but actually an industry that is trustworthy and reliable\u201d. The question remains whether Lewis\u2019s approach is the best we can hope for, or a distraction from real change.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>There\u2019s nothing new about wanting to save money. But now, a decade after the financial crisis, it feels particularly urgent. It\u2019s clear that things will never go back to normal: the days of a secure job for life, with a steadily rising salary and a generous pension pot, are over. You won\u2019t be able to support yourself through old age on your pension alone; you might never make enough to afford your own home.</p> <p>You need to be prudent, but how? Since the deregulation and privatisations of the 1980s, we have had to make more and more financial decisions, and they have become dizzyingly complex. There are so many options: Britain has more than 300 banks, dozens of energy companies. Then there are all the credit cards, broadband providers, mobile networks. You know that if make the wrong choice you will get ripped off. It\u2019s easy to panic or to bury your head in the sand.</p> <p>What has made Lewis so popular is that he offers a concrete response to this uncertainty. His work holds out the hope that you can take control of your finances and your life. This isn\u2019t a question of stopping spending. \u201cI don\u2019t think being tight is a particularly sensible thing with money,\u201d he told me. He wants to help people get more from the money they have, and reduce the stress that money can cause. The trick is to \u201cplay the system, understand how it works, get the best products\u201d \u2013 to turn modern finance\u2019s diversity to your own advantage, rather than being overwhelmed and exploited by it.</p> <p>In this respect, Lewis is less like a doctor, doling out pills for the patient to swallow, than a personal trainer: he promises to make you stronger through your own hard work. And no matter how little you understand at first, you can still judge his advice for yourself by its effect on your bank balance. This is what has saved Lewis from the fate of so many experts, who incur resentment by appearing to lord their expertise over everyone else. Instead of just telling you what to do, Lewis makes you feel as if you, too, can become a money-saving expert.</p> <p>When Lewis was in charge of Money Saving Expert, he worked up to 90 hours a week. Since selling the company, he has continued to play an important role, as executive chairman, and pictures of him wearing a confident expression appear all over the website like a talisman against profligacy. But even though he has cut down, to 50 or 60 hours, his schedule still appears exhausting in its variety and intensity. Rather than prioritising a particular audience, he addresses whoever he can, modulating his message each time like a shrewd ambassador for financial prudence. What matters to him is getting the word out. </p> <p>On a Monday morning last summer, I accompanied Lewis to ITV\u2019s studios in west London for his appearance on This Morning. As he waited to go on set, he asked a member of the crew if she watched Love Island. She didn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of doing Love Island this year,\u201d he said. When his turn on This Morning came, he took questions about student finance from callers, staring intensely at the camera as he listened. As usual, he spoke in rapidfire bursts, slowing down theatrically for emphasis.</p> <p>After that, he got a motorbike taxi to Broadcasting House, the BBC headquarters, for his weekly <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06zbg15\" title=\"\">Radio 5 Live phone-in</a>. The segment was introduced with the song Bills, by the American singer LunchMoney Lewis, and as it played Lewis air drummed, bobbing his head. It was a longer slot than This Morning, with a more leisurely pace; the callers seemed canny, and Lewis responded with a level of detail he tends to avoid on TV. That afternoon, he attended a meeting at the <a href=\"https://www.moneyandmentalhealth.org/\" title=\"\">Money and Mental Health Policy Institute</a>, a charity that he founded in 2016, to carry out research and campaigns on the connection between mental illness and financial problems.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1c6f0683f2eacc0c813446cd420d7d4588cfb120\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c6f0683f2eacc0c813446cd420d7d4588cfb120/0_116_3636_2182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On stage at a charity event at the O2 Arena in London in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On stage at a charity event at the O2 Arena in London in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Kent/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The next day, Lewis met with Matt Hancock, who was then the culture secretary. It was a few weeks after Lewis had announced that he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/22/martin-lewis-sues-facebook-over-fake-ads-with-his-name\" title=\"\">suing Facebook</a> for defamation, over fake adverts that featured his name and image, and the pair discussed online ads and scams. That evening, Lewis started tweeting about Love Island. \u201cI\u2019ve never watched before \u2013 I\u2019m trying it this time \u2013 and yes I am intrigued,\u201d he told his 566,000 followers. On Good Morning Britain that week, he referred to a Love Island contestant\u2019s \u201csemi-permanent Russian lashes\u201d. When a presenter asked what made the lashes Russian, Lewis responded, \u201cmaybe they need to get them on quickly\u201d. (He was once a finalist in a competition for young Jewish stand-up comedians.) He made a \u201cba-dum-tish\u201d sound, with a drumming gesture, and walked off the set. Two days later, he wrote a comment piece for the Financial Times, proposing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3b9eb0e-601f-11e8-ab47-8fd33f423c09\" title=\"\">reforms to student finance</a>.</p> <p>Lewis, who has a knack for remembering numbers, is happy to play the role of a financial savant in his TV appearances. \u201cIs there something you don\u2019t know? Anything you don\u2019t know?\u201d Angellica Bell, his co-host on The Martin Lewis Money Show, asked in a recent live special. But his displays of knowledge are mostly for show: their purpose is not so much to convey information as to demonstrate his mastery of the material, his fitness to instruct. His actual advice, on the other hand, is often surprisingly simple.</p> <p>Consider the \u201cMoney Mantras\u201d, the cornerstone of the Money Saving Expert philosophy. Before buying anything, you ask yourself two questions. If you\u2019re broke: \u201cDo I need it? Can I afford it?\u201d If you can afford the item: \u201cWill I use it? Is it worth it?\u201d If the answer to any of the questions is \u201cNo\u201d, then it\u2019s clear: don\u2019t buy it.</p> <p>If that seems obvious, then Lewis\u2019s prescription for budgeting is a little more technical. You do an audit of your outgoings, to establish how much you can actually afford to spend. Then you single out a few main categories: these might be bills, holidays, Christmas, savings and big purchases. You open a dedicated bank account for each of them, and use standing orders from your main account to ensure you\u2019re setting aside what you need for every category. It\u2019s fairly straightforward, but takes a lot of effort to set up \u2013 a day\u2019s work, in Lewis\u2019s estimation. He calls this technique \u201cpiggybanking\u201d, with each account a different piggybank.</p> <p>Money Saving Expert has proved to be very effective at making money, yet Lewis considers it a public service above all. \u201cThis is a mission,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a consumer website, but it\u2019s not there to be all wonderful and give people what they want. All they would want is \u00a310-off shopping vouchers, because they\u2019re fun and most people don\u2019t want to deal with their finances. And we have a job to twist their nipples in any way we can.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>One morning, a couple of months after he met Hancock, I joined Lewis on the 50-minute walk from his home just outside central London to the Money Saving Expert office. Lewis tries to walk everywhere. According to his fitness tracker, he averaged 13 miles a day in 2018, a 4% fall on the previous year. The route had just taken us through Regent\u2019s Park; as we got on to Euston Road, Lewis told me about arriving at Cardiff University in 1997, to do a postgraduate diploma in journalism. \u201cEverybody else wanted to be a war correspondent or go in fighting zones,\u201d he said. \u201cI talked about doing money on This Morning.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis was born in Manchester in 1973 and spent most of his childhood in Delamere Forest in Cheshire, where his father ran a Jewish boarding school for pupils with special needs. Three days before Lewis\u2019s 12th birthday, his mother was killed in a road accident. Losing a parent at a young age \u201cgives you a drive,\u201d he said in a talk in 2014. \u201cNothing is going to be quite as bad as it\u2019s already been, so you can go for it.\u201d</p> <p>After studying at the London School of Economics, Lewis spent two years working in financial PR, then moved into journalism. He got his first job on air when a cable channel devoted to finance, Simply Money, launched in 2000. Angela Rippon, the TV presenter who fronted the channel, told me that it was Lewis\u2019s sketches that made him distinctive. Alongside his regular reporting, he dressed up as different characters \u2013 Dracula, a card dealer \u2013 in order to illustrate his points. One of Lewis\u2019s strengths as a broadcaster is that he is not afraid to be naff \u2013 in fact, he revels in the naff. \u201cIt engaged the viewers in a way that financial reporting had never done before,\u201d Rippon said. He has never been bothered by accusations that he is dumbing down. \u201cI know I\u2019m good at what I do,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, the passion is about reaching real people and getting them to be better on their finances.\u201d</p> <p>In his first year at Simply Money, Lewis asked to be known on-screen as \u201cthe Money Saving Expert\u201d. After the channel shut down, he kept the name, paid \u00a3100 to a web designer in Uzbekistan \u2013 his sole capital outlay in the decade that he owned Money Saving Expert \u2013 and launched the site in 2003.</p> <p>Back then, Lewis told me, media coverage of personal finance was limited to \u201cinvestment, protection, and maybe mortgages if you want to be radical\u201d. What he had in mind was something different: a one-stop shop that covered money as it works in everyday life. That meant advice on supermarkets (\u201ceye-level products are where the profit is\u201d) and where to get the cheapest DVD rentals and perfume. \u201cHe has taken it into getting a good deal in every single aspect of your life,\u201d says Anne Ashworth, who edits the Times\u2019s Money section. By moving beyond the constraints of traditional personal finance journalism, he became, more and more, a life coach.</p> <p>What was particularly striking about Lewis\u2019s approach was how confrontational it was. Money Saving Expert\u2019s home page used to have a promise for readers: \u201cCompanies try to screw us for profits. Money-saving shows you how to screw them back.\u201d Journalists had long singled out firms that shortchanged their customers, but this was undiscriminating \u2013 it suggested that consumers couldn\u2019t trust anyone. In The Money Diet, his 2004 guide to saving money, which doubles as a kind of early manifesto, Lewis argued that it was the job of businesses to make money \u2013 \u201cnowt wrong with that\u201d. But for that very reason, he wrote, \u201call companies are the enemy\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bf2ba171f2574719570eb35cc895335c4ee91fa3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf2ba171f2574719570eb35cc895335c4ee91fa3/0_0_2700_2025/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Lewis promoting his ITV show in 2005\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He is not afraid to be naff \u2013 in fact, he revels in the naff\u2019 \u2026 Lewis promoting his ITV show in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The tools offered by the site don\u2019t always match up to this rhetoric. The Money Mantras alone won\u2019t help you screw companies back. It takes real effort; you have to exploit the loopholes identified by Money Saving Expert, and mop up one introductory offer after another. In the argot of the website, people who keep doing this by switching banks are approvingly referred to as \u201ctarts\u201d.</p> <p>Money Saving Expert quickly took off: by 2006, it was getting 1m visitors a month. As it expanded, Lewis\u2019s profile grew. He got an ITV series; another series, It Pays to Watch!, aired on Five in 2008, the year the global financial crisis inaugurated an era of perpetual insecurity. In 2012, when ITV launched The Martin Lewis Money Show, he finally got what he had spent years working towards: a programme at primetime. It airs on Mondays at 8pm, between episodes of Coronation Street. The show is centred on questions that Lewis takes from members of the public, at roadshows around the country. It\u2019s slicker than his earlier programmes, but features the kind of sketches that he first tried out on Simply Money, giving it something of a variety-show feel.</p> <p>In June, Lewis recorded a live special of the show at Warwick Castle. A Martin Lewis Money Show flag, featuring coins, notes, credit cards and a piggy bank, flew from the tower. Lewis wandered around beforehand, looking a little nervous. He was more smartly dressed than usual, and boasted to the audience that he had bought his blazer in a sale. \u201cWe\u2019re going to save millions of people lots of money,\u201d he told them, \u201cwhich is why I get out of bed in the morning.\u201d During the show, Lewis reminded everyone going away that summer to pack their European Health Insurance Card; by the end of the episode, the EHIC website had crashed.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Lewis is fond of saying that he has never been interested in money; he\u2019s more interested in what having money allows you to do, and the problems that stem from not having it. He considers himself \u201ca politician with a small p\u201d, whose goal is to achieve \u201cfinancial justice\u201d. He has tried his best to do this while keeping out of the political fray. But over the past few years, that balancing act has become impossible. Reluctantly, Lewis has found himself dragged into politics.</p> <p>Lewis\u2019s first campaign, in 2005, was against bank charges: the fees levied on customers who go beyond their overdraft limit. At the time, even if someone was just a penny over the limit, they usually had to pay their bank about \u00a335. Since Lewis started campaigning against the charges, 7m template letters \u2013 which people fill in and send to their bank, in order to request that the charges be repaid \u2013 have been downloaded <a href=\"https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/reclaim/bank-charges/\" title=\"\">from Money Saving Expert</a> and \u00a31bn reclaimed. The campaign inspired a song, I Fought the Lloyds by Oystar, a comedy-rock band whose singer had used Money Saving Expert to challenge the charges. It charted at #No 25 and Lewis made a cameo in the video.</p> <p>Not long after that campaign, Lewis deployed similar tactics against banks that had missold payment protection insurance (PPI) to customers. This time, Money Saving Expert\u2019s template letters resulted in as much as \u00a35bn in compensation. More recently, Lewis has taken a different approach, by challenging the government itself. In 2011, soon after it was announced that university tuition fees would rise from \u00a33,290 a year to a maximum of \u00a39,000, Lewis was appointed head of the Independent Taskforce on Student Finance Information, which sought to explain what the new fees would involve. At the time, Lewis said he was \u201cno fan of the changes\u201d, but his priority was ensuring that everyone was properly informed about them. \u201cThere were people he could communicate with who wouldn\u2019t have trusted politicians,\u201d says David Willetts, the universities minister at the time.</p> <p>Lewis turned on the government when it froze the repayment threshold \u2013 the amount graduates need to earn before they start paying off their loans. Having been set at \u00a321,000, this was meant to eventually increase every year, but in 2015 George Osborne backtracked. Lewis was appalled. In articles and TV appearances, he kept making his case; he met with Jo Johnson, who was then the universities minister. In 2017, Theresa May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/01/tuition-fee-repayment-earnings-threshold-rise-to-25000\" title=\"\">finally relented</a>: she announced the threshold would go up after all, to \u00a325,000, and increase thereafter.</p> <p>Lewis\u2019s journalism offers lessons in self-reliance, ways for individuals to protect themselves. But he acknowledges that this isn\u2019t always enough. \u201cThere are people out there who have less income than the basic minimum they need to subsist,\u201d he says. As part of his efforts towards \u201cfinancial justice\u201d, he has pledged around \u00a320m to charity.</p> <p>Perhaps Lewis\u2019s most high-profile public intervention came last year, when he learned that his image was being used on targeted Facebook adverts without his consent. Many of them claimed he was endorsing bitcoin schemes that were actually fronts for ultra-high-risk investments; one woman lost \u00a3100,000 as a result. Lewis approached Facebook about the ads but it failed to take any serious action, so he decided to sue.</p> <p>When he announced the lawsuit in April, it struck a nerve. The story made the front pages. Lewis was all over television, but he looked rattled. Unlike his previous campaigns, this one was personal and he didn\u2019t enjoy the attention. \u201cI do not handle stress particularly well. I am a very shy person,\u201d he told me. Lewis is very protective of his privacy. He is married to Lara Lewington, a BBC presenter, with whom he has a six-year-old daughter. When I joined him on his walk to work, we didn\u2019t meet at his home; instead, I waited at a hotel nearby. When he eventually called me to arrange a meeting point, his number showed up as \u201cNo caller ID\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"efa821acd45e265fc61dcc2edeb2960495f06d71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efa821acd45e265fc61dcc2edeb2960495f06d71/63_4_3401_2040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lewis with Steve Hatch, Facebook\u2019s VP in northern Europe, after Lewis dropped his lawsuit against the social media company in January 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lewis with Steve Hatch, Facebook\u2019s VP in northern Europe, after Lewis dropped his lawsuit against the social media company earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty O\u2019Connor/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s tempting to see the Facebook lawsuit as a dramatic battle: Lewis, the people\u2019s champion, taking on an unaccountable Silicon Valley behemoth. Even politicians unwilling to challenge the firm wanted him to play that role. \u201cI have had, let\u2019s say, very senior members of government who have pressured me and said: \u2018Please don\u2019t settle. Take it to court, set a precedent\u2019,\u201d Lewis said. Yet his aim was, as ever, more modest. \u201cThis is not an anti-Facebook campaign,\u201d he told me, when we discussed the lawsuit last year. \u201cThis is an anti-scam ads campaign.\u201d Last week, he announced that he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/23/martin-lewis-drops-lawsuit-as-facebook-backs-scam-ads-scheme\" title=\"\">dropping the case</a> because Facebook had agreed to introduce new measures tackling scam ads.</p> <p>There was a time when Lewis wanted to go into politics. At the LSE, he was elected head of the student union. He ran as an independent; the union had previously been dominated by the far left, and Lewis promised to deliver \u201ca student union for all\u201d. Outside the LSE, Lewis was affiliated with the Lib Dems, and led the party in the National Union of Students. \u201cI had no doubt he would go on to be a Lib Dem MP,\u201d said Raj Jethwa, who ran against Lewis in the student union elections.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to imagine Lewis as an MP: he has the verbal tics of a modern politician, often starting his sentences with a \u201clook\u201d or \u201clisten\u201d. Even after setting up Money Saving Expert, Lewis still imagined he would eventually run for parliament. But when he hit his mid-30s, he decided he wasn\u2019t suited to a career in politics. \u201cI know I couldn\u2019t cope with it,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019m nowhere near as a robust as I was when I was younger.\u201d</p> <p>A few years ago, Lewis applied to be a cross-bench member of the House of Lords \u2013 <a href=\"https://lordsappointments.independent.gov.uk/how-to-apply\" title=\"\">a process open to anyone</a> \u2013 and was rejected. He is keen to stress that he doesn\u2019t identify as party political, though he has been approached by numerous parties, including United for Change, the new centrist party. He sees himself \u201csomewhere from a wet Tory, a right Labour or a Lib Dem\u201d. That outlook doesn\u2019t always square with his more incendiary rhetoric. Throughout his career, Lewis has railed against the excesses of business, and seen first-hand how they can affect people; he has attacked banks and energy companies. But while he seeks to empower individual consumers, he stops short of calling for radical solutions that might level the playing field altogether: drastic regulation, or even nationalisation. His work seems to add up to a damning critique of the status quo, without seeking to fundamentally change it.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Money Saving Expert operates according to the optimistic principle that if someone knows enough, they should be able to make the right decisions. When I went to events where Lewis was filming and spoke to the people in attendance, I was struck by how clued up they were. They had saved thousands through cashback services, or switching between credit cards \u2013 tricks they had learned from Lewis. But in their commitment to saving money, they were willing to put in the kind of time that most people just don\u2019t have.</p> <p>What kind of an impact has Lewis had on the less savvy, who he has tried so hard to reach? He has certainly helped lots of people: the millions of template letters downloaded from his site testify to that. But according to a Financial Conduct Authority <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/research/financial-lives-survey-2017.pdf\" title=\"\">survey from 2017</a>, 46% of adults in the UK say they have low knowledge of financial matters; 24% have little or no confidence in managing their money. In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jul/26/household-debt-in-uk-worse-than-at-any-time-on-record\" title=\"\">British households spent</a> around \u00a3900 more, on average, than they earned. For many, there are stumbling blocks to following Lewis\u2019s advice. \u201cPeople are not making decisions on a level playing field,\u201d says Liz McFall, a sociologist at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cNot everyone has access to the same things\u201d \u2013 such as 0% credit card deals.</p> <p>Yet there is more to Lewis\u2019s ambitions than simply educating people about money. He wants to change the way they think and talk about it. \u201cIf we take the American look at money, which is where money is just something open that you communicate about, I actually think that is healthier than our more British poe-facedness,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>That reticence can have dire consequences. \u201cI think some of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gender-pay-gap\" title=\"\">gender pay gap</a> is because we don\u2019t talk about salaries in this country,\u201d Lewis says. Not discussing money also affects how much we spend on things. \u201cIf I don\u2019t know how much you paid for your plumber, how do I know what I\u2019m supposed to pay for my plumber?\u201d Through his work, Lewis meets people with crippling debts, and sees the psychological toll that money can take. He can be emotional on screen, and open about his own vulnerabilities. When people are unable to talk about their finances, he says, it means they are unable to talk about the problems that stem from them. \u201cThat\u2019s not good for our society.\u201d</p> <p>That may be slowly changing. McFall notes that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/dec/18/what-i-learned-after-my-money-diary-went-viral\" title=\"\">many younger people</a> are open about the financial difficulties they face: their high student loan debt, the obstacles to buying a first property. \u201cAll of those things mean that financial details about how people live are in the public sphere in a way that they weren\u2019t, historically,\u201d she says. But Lewis thinks there is a long way to go. \u201cWe have got rid of the taboo of talking about sex and religion. And thankfully, we\u2019re starting to get rid of the taboo of talking about your mental health. But money\u2019s still there.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/19/wolves-of-instagram-jordan-belmont-social-media-traders\">Fake it till you make it: meet the wolves of Instagram</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lewis is constantly reminded that his work is incomplete. When I joined him on his walk to work, he told me about something he had recently overheard in a restaurant. A group of young professionals had been sitting near him, discussing which cards they use when they go overseas. \u201cThey were all getting it so wrong,\u201d he said, as we walked down Oxford Street. \u201cI found them painful.\u201d He sounded personally affronted. I wondered why he cared so much about what other people did with their money. What was it about the conversation that he had found so painful? \u201cBecause it\u2019s fact!\u201d he said, his voice rising in exasperation. \u201cIt\u2019s not opinion. It\u2019s just a simple fact.\u201d Like many experts, he seemed to feel that if people just listened to him, it would make everyone\u2019s lives so much easier.</p> <p>This is the territory in which Lewis is still most comfortable: the realm of the indisputable, where one figure is higher than another, where there is no politics or emotion to complicate and corrupt. With money, countless things will always remain uncertain: which stocks will go up, say, or when to buy euros for your holiday. That\u2019s not what Lewis is about. \u201cPeople want to know what to invest in; I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do know what the best card to spend abroad is. Manifestly, directly, on a spreadsheet, no question. I know the answer.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Every Tuesday night, an email newsletter goes out to 13 million subscribers. It\u2019s far more popular than Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop newsletter, which has 8 million, and the New York Times Morning Briefing, with 1.7 million. Its name, Money Saving Expert\u2019s Money Tips, barely hints at the astounding range of tricks and deals contained within. Recent emails have featured \u201chacks\u201d for cheaper meals at Nando\u2019s and McDonald\u2019s, deals on broadband and savings accounts, codes giving discounted access to airport lounges and an offer for free radiator heat-reflector pads. The newsletter looks like a relic from an earlier age of the internet: thousands of words, with no ads and few images. It began as an email that Martin Lewis \u2013 the personal finance journalist now better known as the Money Saving Expert \u2013 wrote for his friends. Today, it is the work of dozens of people at MoneySavingExpert.com, the website Lewis founded in 2003, which has become one of the 100 most popular sites in the UK, with 16 million visitors a month. The business of saving money has made Lewis extremely wealthy. After he sold the site in 2012 to the price-comparison firm MoneySupermarket for \u00a387m, the Financial Times called him \u201cthe most successful journalist in the world, ever\u201d. A year later, he was the seventh most Googled celebrity in the UK, nestled between Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9. Lewis still worries over every line in the email each week. When I went to meet him on a Tuesday afternoon last July, he was studying the draft of that night\u2019s newsletter, pondering aloud the merits of competing broadband deals. There was a gold piggy bank on his desk. It was the height of the heatwave, and Lewis, who is lean and often tanned, was dressed in the uniform of a sensible dad doing his best to enjoy a long-awaited summer holiday: a short-sleeved, stripy white shirt with a denim collar, denim shorts and the navy Skechers that he wore almost every time I met him. At a time when money has become the measure of everything \u2013 when people often think of themselves as consumers rather than citizens \u2013 Lewis has become the most trusted man in Britain. In 2015, seven months before the EU referendum, a poll found that 71% of people trusted him when he talked about Europe, putting him ahead of any other public figure. He has achieved that status through an unusual combination of journalism, campaigning and light entertainment, without falling victim to the public\u2019s suspicion of journalists, campaigners and entertainers. In our age of insecurity, Lewis stands out as a reassuring source of authority. Addressing a country that has never been comfortable talking about money, Lewis takes us by the hand and guides us through the bewildering world of finance. He comes across as a kind of double agent, who goes undercover among the powerful then reports back to the rest of society. It may feel as though banks, corporations and energy companies are lined up against the individual, with few politicians willing to intervene, but Lewis\u2019s work offers the alluring promise that in the battle between business and consumer, you can, with the right information, emerge the victor. Today, at 46, Lewis is a TV personality as much as anything. He appears weekly on Good Morning Britain and This Morning, while his primetime ITV programme, The Martin Lewis Money Show, regularly attracts around 4 million viewers. Lewis\u2019s success depends on the trust he has built with the public, and he tends to this like an anxious parent. Everything featured on Money Saving Expert has been chosen by its editorial team, but once those recommendations have been decided on, the commercial team then tries to arrange deals with the companies offering the products. The site makes a commission when readers click on affiliated links for such products, which are marked with an asterisk. Still, when I joined Lewis for his meeting about the email, he was cautious. He worried that one description was too \u201cselly\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to think we\u2019re advertising,\u201d he said. A fidgety presence, he took great care with the recommendations, mindful of the impact they can have: Tesco Bank\u2019s website once crashed when one of its savings accounts appeared in the email. Lewis applies that same care to his campaigns and public pronouncements. He has based his career on just about the last thing we all have in common: the wish to save money. And he tends not to weigh in on the most contentious issues of the day, for fear of dividing opinion and undermining his sway. He believes he can have the biggest impact on society by changing our relationship to money \u2013 but it has become harder for him to stay out of politics altogether. He even weighed in on the EU referendum, although in an ostentatiously measured manner: \u201cI\u2019m generally risk-averse, and that pushes me just towards an IN vote for safety, maybe 55% to 45%,\u201d he wrote on Money Saving Expert. When we spoke recently, Lewis told me: \u201cI have built myself what is currently a unique position in trying to guide people to be better with their finances. And I don\u2019t want to do anything to screw that, to get rid of that trust.\u201d With his fiery rhetoric, his efforts to defend the little guy against vested interests, Lewis may look like a populist. But, at heart, he has a technocratic temperament: he identifies specific problems, and tries to solve them with tweaks. On the rare occasions when he does speak out, it\u2019s because he has decided the system has stopped working properly. Lewis is, in short, a centrist \u2013 perhaps the only truly popular centrist in Britain. Instead of seeking structural change, his formula combines educating the public with campaigning for small adjustments to the system. But at a time of growing inequality, with politicians unwilling or unable to hold corporations to account, is this enough? What is needed, the economist John Kay told me, \u201cis not more information from the financial services industry, but actually an industry that is trustworthy and reliable\u201d. The question remains whether Lewis\u2019s approach is the best we can hope for, or a distraction from real change. * * * There\u2019s nothing new about wanting to save money. But now, a decade after the financial crisis, it feels particularly urgent. It\u2019s clear that things will never go back to normal: the days of a secure job for life, with a steadily rising salary and a generous pension pot, are over. You won\u2019t be able to support yourself through old age on your pension alone; you might never make enough to afford your own home. You need to be prudent, but how? Since the deregulation and privatisations of the 1980s, we have had to make more and more financial decisions, and they have become dizzyingly complex. There are so many options: Britain has more than 300 banks, dozens of energy companies. Then there are all the credit cards, broadband providers, mobile networks. You know that if make the wrong choice you will get ripped off. It\u2019s easy to panic or to bury your head in the sand. What has made Lewis so popular is that he offers a concrete response to this uncertainty. His work holds out the hope that you can take control of your finances and your life. This isn\u2019t a question of stopping spending. \u201cI don\u2019t think being tight is a particularly sensible thing with money,\u201d he told me. He wants to help people get more from the money they have, and reduce the stress that money can cause. The trick is to \u201cplay the system, understand how it works, get the best products\u201d \u2013 to turn modern finance\u2019s diversity to your own advantage, rather than being overwhelmed and exploited by it. In this respect, Lewis is less like a doctor, doling out pills for the patient to swallow, than a personal trainer: he promises to make you stronger through your own hard work. And no matter how little you understand at first, you can still judge his advice for yourself by its effect on your bank balance. This is what has saved Lewis from the fate of so many experts, who incur resentment by appearing to lord their expertise over everyone else. Instead of just telling you what to do, Lewis makes you feel as if you, too, can become a money-saving expert. When Lewis was in charge of Money Saving Expert, he worked up to 90 hours a week. Since selling the company, he has continued to play an important role, as executive chairman, and pictures of him wearing a confident expression appear all over the website like a talisman against profligacy. But even though he has cut down, to 50 or 60 hours, his schedule still appears exhausting in its variety and intensity. Rather than prioritising a particular audience, he addresses whoever he can, modulating his message each time like a shrewd ambassador for financial prudence. What matters to him is getting the word out. On a Monday morning last summer, I accompanied Lewis to ITV\u2019s studios in west London for his appearance on This Morning. As he waited to go on set, he asked a member of the crew if she watched Love Island. She didn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of doing Love Island this year,\u201d he said. When his turn on This Morning came, he took questions about student finance from callers, staring intensely at the camera as he listened. As usual, he spoke in rapidfire bursts, slowing down theatrically for emphasis. After that, he got a motorbike taxi to Broadcasting House, the BBC headquarters, for his weekly Radio 5 Live phone-in. The segment was introduced with the song Bills, by the American singer LunchMoney Lewis, and as it played Lewis air drummed, bobbing his head. It was a longer slot than This Morning, with a more leisurely pace; the callers seemed canny, and Lewis responded with a level of detail he tends to avoid on TV. That afternoon, he attended a meeting at the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute, a charity that he founded in 2016, to carry out research and campaigns on the connection between mental illness and financial problems. The next day, Lewis met with Matt Hancock, who was then the culture secretary. It was a few weeks after Lewis had announced that he was suing Facebook for defamation, over fake adverts that featured his name and image, and the pair discussed online ads and scams. That evening, Lewis started tweeting about Love Island. \u201cI\u2019ve never watched before \u2013 I\u2019m trying it this time \u2013 and yes I am intrigued,\u201d he told his 566,000 followers. On Good Morning Britain that week, he referred to a Love Island contestant\u2019s \u201csemi-permanent Russian lashes\u201d. When a presenter asked what made the lashes Russian, Lewis responded, \u201cmaybe they need to get them on quickly\u201d. (He was once a finalist in a competition for young Jewish stand-up comedians.) He made a \u201cba-dum-tish\u201d sound, with a drumming gesture, and walked off the set. Two days later, he wrote a comment piece for the Financial Times, proposing reforms to student finance. Lewis, who has a knack for remembering numbers, is happy to play the role of a financial savant in his TV appearances. \u201cIs there something you don\u2019t know? Anything you don\u2019t know?\u201d Angellica Bell, his co-host on The Martin Lewis Money Show, asked in a recent live special. But his displays of knowledge are mostly for show: their purpose is not so much to convey information as to demonstrate his mastery of the material, his fitness to instruct. His actual advice, on the other hand, is often surprisingly simple. Consider the \u201cMoney Mantras\u201d, the cornerstone of the Money Saving Expert philosophy. Before buying anything, you ask yourself two questions. If you\u2019re broke: \u201cDo I need it? Can I afford it?\u201d If you can afford the item: \u201cWill I use it? Is it worth it?\u201d If the answer to any of the questions is \u201cNo\u201d, then it\u2019s clear: don\u2019t buy it. If that seems obvious, then Lewis\u2019s prescription for budgeting is a little more technical. You do an audit of your outgoings, to establish how much you can actually afford to spend. Then you single out a few main categories: these might be bills, holidays, Christmas, savings and big purchases. You open a dedicated bank account for each of them, and use standing orders from your main account to ensure you\u2019re setting aside what you need for every category. It\u2019s fairly straightforward, but takes a lot of effort to set up \u2013 a day\u2019s work, in Lewis\u2019s estimation. He calls this technique \u201cpiggybanking\u201d, with each account a different piggybank. Money Saving Expert has proved to be very effective at making money, yet Lewis considers it a public service above all. \u201cThis is a mission,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a consumer website, but it\u2019s not there to be all wonderful and give people what they want. All they would want is \u00a310-off shopping vouchers, because they\u2019re fun and most people don\u2019t want to deal with their finances. And we have a job to twist their nipples in any way we can.\u201d * * * One morning, a couple of months after he met Hancock, I joined Lewis on the 50-minute walk from his home just outside central London to the Money Saving Expert office. Lewis tries to walk everywhere. According to his fitness tracker, he averaged 13 miles a day in 2018, a 4% fall on the previous year. The route had just taken us through Regent\u2019s Park; as we got on to Euston Road, Lewis told me about arriving at Cardiff University in 1997, to do a postgraduate diploma in journalism. \u201cEverybody else wanted to be a war correspondent or go in fighting zones,\u201d he said. \u201cI talked about doing money on This Morning.\u201d Lewis was born in Manchester in 1973 and spent most of his childhood in Delamere Forest in Cheshire, where his father ran a Jewish boarding school for pupils with special needs. Three days before Lewis\u2019s 12th birthday, his mother was killed in a road accident. Losing a parent at a young age \u201cgives you a drive,\u201d he said in a talk in 2014. \u201cNothing is going to be quite as bad as it\u2019s already been, so you can go for it.\u201d After studying at the London School of Economics, Lewis spent two years working in financial PR, then moved into journalism. He got his first job on air when a cable channel devoted to finance, Simply Money, launched in 2000. Angela Rippon, the TV presenter who fronted the channel, told me that it was Lewis\u2019s sketches that made him distinctive. Alongside his regular reporting, he dressed up as different characters \u2013 Dracula, a card dealer \u2013 in order to illustrate his points. One of Lewis\u2019s strengths as a broadcaster is that he is not afraid to be naff \u2013 in fact, he revels in the naff. \u201cIt engaged the viewers in a way that financial reporting had never done before,\u201d Rippon said. He has never been bothered by accusations that he is dumbing down. \u201cI know I\u2019m good at what I do,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, the passion is about reaching real people and getting them to be better on their finances.\u201d In his first year at Simply Money, Lewis asked to be known on-screen as \u201cthe Money Saving Expert\u201d. After the channel shut down, he kept the name, paid \u00a3100 to a web designer in Uzbekistan \u2013 his sole capital outlay in the decade that he owned Money Saving Expert \u2013 and launched the site in 2003. Back then, Lewis told me, media coverage of personal finance was limited to \u201cinvestment, protection, and maybe mortgages if you want to be radical\u201d. What he had in mind was something different: a one-stop shop that covered money as it works in everyday life. That meant advice on supermarkets (\u201ceye-level products are where the profit is\u201d) and where to get the cheapest DVD rentals and perfume. \u201cHe has taken it into getting a good deal in every single aspect of your life,\u201d says Anne Ashworth, who edits the Times\u2019s Money section. By moving beyond the constraints of traditional personal finance journalism, he became, more and more, a life coach. What was particularly striking about Lewis\u2019s approach was how confrontational it was. Money Saving Expert\u2019s home page used to have a promise for readers: \u201cCompanies try to screw us for profits. Money-saving shows you how to screw them back.\u201d Journalists had long singled out firms that shortchanged their customers, but this was undiscriminating \u2013 it suggested that consumers couldn\u2019t trust anyone. In The Money Diet, his 2004 guide to saving money, which doubles as a kind of early manifesto, Lewis argued that it was the job of businesses to make money \u2013 \u201cnowt wrong with that\u201d. But for that very reason, he wrote, \u201call companies are the enemy\u201d. The tools offered by the site don\u2019t always match up to this rhetoric. The Money Mantras alone won\u2019t help you screw companies back. It takes real effort; you have to exploit the loopholes identified by Money Saving Expert, and mop up one introductory offer after another. In the argot of the website, people who keep doing this by switching banks are approvingly referred to as \u201ctarts\u201d. Money Saving Expert quickly took off: by 2006, it was getting 1m visitors a month. As it expanded, Lewis\u2019s profile grew. He got an ITV series; another series, It Pays to Watch!, aired on Five in 2008, the year the global financial crisis inaugurated an era of perpetual insecurity. In 2012, when ITV launched The Martin Lewis Money Show, he finally got what he had spent years working towards: a programme at primetime. It airs on Mondays at 8pm, between episodes of Coronation Street. The show is centred on questions that Lewis takes from members of the public, at roadshows around the country. It\u2019s slicker than his earlier programmes, but features the kind of sketches that he first tried out on Simply Money, giving it something of a variety-show feel. In June, Lewis recorded a live special of the show at Warwick Castle. A Martin Lewis Money Show flag, featuring coins, notes, credit cards and a piggy bank, flew from the tower. Lewis wandered around beforehand, looking a little nervous. He was more smartly dressed than usual, and boasted to the audience that he had bought his blazer in a sale. \u201cWe\u2019re going to save millions of people lots of money,\u201d he told them, \u201cwhich is why I get out of bed in the morning.\u201d During the show, Lewis reminded everyone going away that summer to pack their European Health Insurance Card; by the end of the episode, the EHIC website had crashed. * * * Lewis is fond of saying that he has never been interested in money; he\u2019s more interested in what having money allows you to do, and the problems that stem from not having it. He considers himself \u201ca politician with a small p\u201d, whose goal is to achieve \u201cfinancial justice\u201d. He has tried his best to do this while keeping out of the political fray. But over the past few years, that balancing act has become impossible. Reluctantly, Lewis has found himself dragged into politics. Lewis\u2019s first campaign, in 2005, was against bank charges: the fees levied on customers who go beyond their overdraft limit. At the time, even if someone was just a penny over the limit, they usually had to pay their bank about \u00a335. Since Lewis started campaigning against the charges, 7m template letters \u2013 which people fill in and send to their bank, in order to request that the charges be repaid \u2013 have been downloaded from Money Saving Expert and \u00a31bn reclaimed. The campaign inspired a song, I Fought the Lloyds by Oystar, a comedy-rock band whose singer had used Money Saving Expert to challenge the charges. It charted at #No 25 and Lewis made a cameo in the video. Not long after that campaign, Lewis deployed similar tactics against banks that had missold payment protection insurance (PPI) to customers. This time, Money Saving Expert\u2019s template letters resulted in as much as \u00a35bn in compensation. More recently, Lewis has taken a different approach, by challenging the government itself. In 2011, soon after it was announced that university tuition fees would rise from \u00a33,290 a year to a maximum of \u00a39,000, Lewis was appointed head of the Independent Taskforce on Student Finance Information, which sought to explain what the new fees would involve. At the time, Lewis said he was \u201cno fan of the changes\u201d, but his priority was ensuring that everyone was properly informed about them. \u201cThere were people he could communicate with who wouldn\u2019t have trusted politicians,\u201d says David Willetts, the universities minister at the time. Lewis turned on the government when it froze the repayment threshold \u2013 the amount graduates need to earn before they start paying off their loans. Having been set at \u00a321,000, this was meant to eventually increase every year, but in 2015 George Osborne backtracked. Lewis was appalled. In articles and TV appearances, he kept making his case; he met with Jo Johnson, who was then the universities minister. In 2017, Theresa May finally relented: she announced the threshold would go up after all, to \u00a325,000, and increase thereafter. Lewis\u2019s journalism offers lessons in self-reliance, ways for individuals to protect themselves. But he acknowledges that this isn\u2019t always enough. \u201cThere are people out there who have less income than the basic minimum they need to subsist,\u201d he says. As part of his efforts towards \u201cfinancial justice\u201d, he has pledged around \u00a320m to charity. Perhaps Lewis\u2019s most high-profile public intervention came last year, when he learned that his image was being used on targeted Facebook adverts without his consent. Many of them claimed he was endorsing bitcoin schemes that were actually fronts for ultra-high-risk investments; one woman lost \u00a3100,000 as a result. Lewis approached Facebook about the ads but it failed to take any serious action, so he decided to sue. When he announced the lawsuit in April, it struck a nerve. The story made the front pages. Lewis was all over television, but he looked rattled. Unlike his previous campaigns, this one was personal and he didn\u2019t enjoy the attention. \u201cI do not handle stress particularly well. I am a very shy person,\u201d he told me. Lewis is very protective of his privacy. He is married to Lara Lewington, a BBC presenter, with whom he has a six-year-old daughter. When I joined him on his walk to work, we didn\u2019t meet at his home; instead, I waited at a hotel nearby. When he eventually called me to arrange a meeting point, his number showed up as \u201cNo caller ID\u201d. It\u2019s tempting to see the Facebook lawsuit as a dramatic battle: Lewis, the people\u2019s champion, taking on an unaccountable Silicon Valley behemoth. Even politicians unwilling to challenge the firm wanted him to play that role. \u201cI have had, let\u2019s say, very senior members of government who have pressured me and said: \u2018Please don\u2019t settle. Take it to court, set a precedent\u2019,\u201d Lewis said. Yet his aim was, as ever, more modest. \u201cThis is not an anti-Facebook campaign,\u201d he told me, when we discussed the lawsuit last year. \u201cThis is an anti-scam ads campaign.\u201d Last week, he announced that he was dropping the case because Facebook had agreed to introduce new measures tackling scam ads. There was a time when Lewis wanted to go into politics. At the LSE, he was elected head of the student union. He ran as an independent; the union had previously been dominated by the far left, and Lewis promised to deliver \u201ca student union for all\u201d. Outside the LSE, Lewis was affiliated with the Lib Dems, and led the party in the National Union of Students. \u201cI had no doubt he would go on to be a Lib Dem MP,\u201d said Raj Jethwa, who ran against Lewis in the student union elections. It\u2019s easy to imagine Lewis as an MP: he has the verbal tics of a modern politician, often starting his sentences with a \u201clook\u201d or \u201clisten\u201d. Even after setting up Money Saving Expert, Lewis still imagined he would eventually run for parliament. But when he hit his mid-30s, he decided he wasn\u2019t suited to a career in politics. \u201cI know I couldn\u2019t cope with it,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019m nowhere near as a robust as I was when I was younger.\u201d A few years ago, Lewis applied to be a cross-bench member of the House of Lords \u2013 a process open to anyone \u2013 and was rejected. He is keen to stress that he doesn\u2019t identify as party political, though he has been approached by numerous parties, including United for Change, the new centrist party. He sees himself \u201csomewhere from a wet Tory, a right Labour or a Lib Dem\u201d. That outlook doesn\u2019t always square with his more incendiary rhetoric. Throughout his career, Lewis has railed against the excesses of business, and seen first-hand how they can affect people; he has attacked banks and energy companies. But while he seeks to empower individual consumers, he stops short of calling for radical solutions that might level the playing field altogether: drastic regulation, or even nationalisation. His work seems to add up to a damning critique of the status quo, without seeking to fundamentally change it. * * * Money Saving Expert operates according to the optimistic principle that if someone knows enough, they should be able to make the right decisions. When I went to events where Lewis was filming and spoke to the people in attendance, I was struck by how clued up they were. They had saved thousands through cashback services, or switching between credit cards \u2013 tricks they had learned from Lewis. But in their commitment to saving money, they were willing to put in the kind of time that most people just don\u2019t have. What kind of an impact has Lewis had on the less savvy, who he has tried so hard to reach? He has certainly helped lots of people: the millions of template letters downloaded from his site testify to that. But according to a Financial Conduct Authority survey from 2017, 46% of adults in the UK say they have low knowledge of financial matters; 24% have little or no confidence in managing their money. In 2017, British households spent around \u00a3900 more, on average, than they earned. For many, there are stumbling blocks to following Lewis\u2019s advice. \u201cPeople are not making decisions on a level playing field,\u201d says Liz McFall, a sociologist at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cNot everyone has access to the same things\u201d \u2013 such as 0% credit card deals. Yet there is more to Lewis\u2019s ambitions than simply educating people about money. He wants to change the way they think and talk about it. \u201cIf we take the American look at money, which is where money is just something open that you communicate about, I actually think that is healthier than our more British poe-facedness,\u201d he told me. That reticence can have dire consequences. \u201cI think some of the gender pay gap is because we don\u2019t talk about salaries in this country,\u201d Lewis says. Not discussing money also affects how much we spend on things. \u201cIf I don\u2019t know how much you paid for your plumber, how do I know what I\u2019m supposed to pay for my plumber?\u201d Through his work, Lewis meets people with crippling debts, and sees the psychological toll that money can take. He can be emotional on screen, and open about his own vulnerabilities. When people are unable to talk about their finances, he says, it means they are unable to talk about the problems that stem from them. \u201cThat\u2019s not good for our society.\u201d That may be slowly changing. McFall notes that many younger people are open about the financial difficulties they face: their high student loan debt, the obstacles to buying a first property. \u201cAll of those things mean that financial details about how people live are in the public sphere in a way that they weren\u2019t, historically,\u201d she says. But Lewis thinks there is a long way to go. \u201cWe have got rid of the taboo of talking about sex and religion. And thankfully, we\u2019re starting to get rid of the taboo of talking about your mental health. But money\u2019s still there.\u201d Lewis is constantly reminded that his work is incomplete. When I joined him on his walk to work, he told me about something he had recently overheard in a restaurant. A group of young professionals had been sitting near him, discussing which cards they use when they go overseas. \u201cThey were all getting it so wrong,\u201d he said, as we walked down Oxford Street. \u201cI found them painful.\u201d He sounded personally affronted. I wondered why he cared so much about what other people did with their money. What was it about the conversation that he had found so painful? \u201cBecause it\u2019s fact!\u201d he said, his voice rising in exasperation. \u201cIt\u2019s not opinion. It\u2019s just a simple fact.\u201d Like many experts, he seemed to feel that if people just listened to him, it would make everyone\u2019s lives so much easier. This is the territory in which Lewis is still most comfortable: the realm of the indisputable, where one figure is higher than another, where there is no politics or emotion to complicate and corrupt. With money, countless things will always remain uncertain: which stocks will go up, say, or when to buy euros for your holiday. That\u2019s not what Lewis is about. \u201cPeople want to know what to invest in; I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do know what the best card to spend abroad is. Manifestly, directly, on a spreadsheet, no question. I know the answer.\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

      "body": "<p>\u2018Thefacebook is an online directory that connects people through social networks at colleges. We have opened up Thefacebook for popular consumption at Harvard University. You can use Thefacebook to: search for people at your school; find out who are [sic] in your classes; look up your friends\u2019 friends; see a visualization of your social network.\u201d</p> <p>On 4 February 2004, this rather clunky announcement launched an invention conceived in the dorm room of a Harvard student called Mark Zuckerberg, and intended to be an improvement on the so-called face books that US universities traditionally used to collect photos and basic information about their students. From the vantage point of 2019, Thefacebook \u2013 as it was then known \u2013 looks familiar, but also strange. Pages were coloured that now familiar shade of blue, and \u201cfriends\u201d were obviously a central element of what was displayed. However, there was little on show from the wider world: the only photos were people\u2019s profile pictures, and there was no ever-changing news feed.</p> <p>Everything on offer was centred on the lives of students: first at Harvard, then at Columbia, Stanford and Yale. On the face of it, the focus was campus dating and a feature whereby users could send each other \u201cpokes\u201d, whose meaning was open to interpretation, thus increasing the fun.</p> <p>Very quickly, though, something else happened. By the autumn of 2005, 85% of US college students were using the site with 60% of students visiting it daily. As they immersed themselves, Thefacebook tapped into the fierce social competitiveness that the US education system seems to be built on. As David Kirkpatrick\u2019s definitive history <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jul/18/the-facebook-effect-david-kirkpatrick-book-review\" title=\"\">The Facebook Effect</a> explains, users of the new site began to fixate on perfecting the details of their profile, not just to date, but to make themselves more attractive as potential friends. This came down to a handful of imperatives: \u201cFind exactly the right profile picture. Change it regularly. Consider carefully how you describe your interests.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, says Kirkpatrick, being a successful Facebooker soon became such a necessity that it began to affect choices people made in the real world: \u201cSince everyone\u2019s classes were listed, some students even began selecting what they studied in order to project a certain image of themselves. And many definitely selected classes based on who Thefacebook indicated would be joining them there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99e4f1c72019b44cf50aded434391046e6f3bf7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99e4f1c72019b44cf50aded434391046e6f3bf7a/36_27_2040_1223/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook creators Mark Zuckerberg (left) and Chris Hughes at Harvard in 2004, the year of its launch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Facebook creators Mark Zuckerberg (left) and Chris Hughes at Harvard in 2004, the year of its launch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Friedman/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everyone, it seemed, was performing, and the basic idea was to do as much performing as possible. At the end of 2004, Thefacebook reached a million users; in September 2006, having renamed itself Facebook, it moved beyond campuses and high schools, and opened itself up to anyone over 13 with an email address. But a core tenet of its Harvard beginnings remained: the imperative for users to present the world with the most flattering impression of themselves.</p> <p>Fifteen years after Facebook\u2019s birth, it has 2.2 billion users, Zuckerberg sits on a fortune of about $55bn (\u00a342bn), and this week the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/30/facebook-fourth-quarter-profits-revenues-earnings\">posted a record profit</a> of $6.88bn for the final three months of 2018. And we know one other thing for sure: tangled up in its success is the fact that people lie about themselves on Facebook, as they do on other social media platforms. In 2016, when the market research firm <a href=\"https://www.custard.co.uk/over-three-quarters-of-brits-say-their-social-media-page-is-a-lie/\" title=\"\">Custard surveyed</a> 2,000 people in the UK, it found that only 18% of them said their Facebook profile accurately represented them, 31% said the face they presented on Facebook boiled down to \u201cpretty much my life but without the boring bits\u201d, and 14% said Facebook made them look \u201cmuch more\u201d socially active than they were. Men, it seemed, were more likely than women to knowingly depart from the truth: 43% admitted to fabricating some aspect of their online selves.</p> <p>That said, there is plenty of evidence of the same everyday deceit on the other side of the gender divide. Six years ago, the market research company OnePoll found that a third of women it surveyed admitted to \u201cdishonesty\u201d on social media. Almost one in four admitted to lying or exaggerating about key aspects of their life online between one and three times a month, and almost one in 10 said they lied more than once a week. Nearly 30% of women lied about doing something when they were really home alone, and 20% were not truthful about their holiday activities or their jobs.</p> <p>On the face of it, this may not seem that revelatory. It is, perhaps, in the nature of our relationships with other human beings that we work desperately hard on our outward presentation, and sometimes fall into a kind of performance that leads inexorably towards fibs.</p> <p>However, the Facebook age marks a break from traditional human behaviour in key aspect. In the past, we could regularly take a break from acting, and revert to some sense of our private, authentic selves. Now, as we constantly prod at our smartphones and feel the pull of their addictive apps, when does the performing ever stop?</p> <p>Along with Russian interference in elections, fake news, Facebook\u2019s approach to hate speech and its insatiable appetite for personal data, this is surely one of the most malign ways in which its presence in our lives is playing out.</p> <p>What its innovations have done to the divide between our social and private lives highlights a mess of stuff to do with the true meanings of intimacy and privacy, and something that goes even closer to the heart of what it is to be human: who we really are beyond the attention and judgments of others, and whether we even know any more.</p> <p>This demise of the barrier between our public and private selves is particularly relevant to people going through that stage of life when the very idea of \u201cself\u201d is still in flux: the often difficult period from the stirrings of adolescence to the mid-20s (and, if you\u2019re unlucky, even older). At that point, sensitivity to your peer group is at its height and an obsession with what some people call \u201csocial comparison\u201d tends to run deep. We all know the basics: you desperately want to meet all the requirements of whichever code of cool is holding sway, and avoid mockery at all costs. Looks are at their peak of importance. So are clothes.</p> <p>In her new doorstop-sized treatise on the dominance of Facebook and Google, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook\" title=\"\">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a>, the American academic Shoshana Zuboff gets to the heart of why social media collides with this stage of life in a particularly toxic way. \u201cSocial media marks a new era in the intensity, density and pervasiveness of social comparison processes especially for the youngest among us, who are \u2018almost constantly online\u2019 at a time of life when one\u2019s own identity, voice and moral agency are a work in progress,\u201d she writes. \u201cIn fact, the psychological tsunami of social comparison triggered by the social media experience is considered unprecedented.\u201d She calls this experience \u201clife in the hive\u201d, and rather chillingly characterises it as \u201cbeing alive in the gaze of others because it\u2019s the only life one has, even when it hurts\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57db19b2c33f960c404518ea8d32d38a8b781c00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57db19b2c33f960c404518ea8d32d38a8b781c00/0_292_5256_3154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"We constantly prod our phones and feel the pull of their apps.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">We constantly prod our phones and feel the pull of their apps.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Odilon Dimier/Getty Images/PhotoAlto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I remember what it was like being 16, and the minefield of peer pressure, ridicule and keeping up with the cool kids I had to navigate. Coming home each afternoon and having long spells to unwind was essential \u2013 in fact, it was in these daily quiet periods that I began to get some vague sense of who I was. If you had told me that in the near future, the noise of school would emanate from an addictive device that compelled me to carry on performing for my peers until I fell asleep, I would probably have screamed. Yet this is now the everyday reality for millions of teenagers, and we all know the likely consequences.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/research-and-data/media-literacy-research/childrens/children-and-parents-media-use-and-attitudes-report-2018\" title=\"\">a report published this week</a> by the media regulator Ofcom, 70% of those aged 12 to 15 have at least one social media profile. Among those aged eight to 11, the figure is 18%. Ofcom says that children\u2019s most visible accounts tend to \u201cbe more highly curated, showing a \u2018picture-perfect\u2019 self\u201d. A substantial body of opinion links depression and anxiety to social media use, something routinely traced to online bullying and negative self-perception caused by reading other people\u2019s online posts. According to the Millennium Cohort Study led by the Institute of Education, London (which follows the life experiences of 19,000 people born at the start of the 21st century), almost 40% of girls who spend more than five hours a day on social media show symptoms of depression; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/19/popular-social-media-sites-harm-young-peoples-mental-health\" title=\"\">research in 2017</a> by the Royal Society for Public Health recorded young people themselves suggesting that all the big social platforms <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/19/popular-social-media-sites-harm-young-peoples-mental-health\" title=\"\">had a negative effect</a> on their mental wellbeing, something that health professionals said was bound up with increased feelings of inadequacy and anxiety.</p> <p>In response, defenders of Facebook might argue that its popularity is declining among younger users, who now prefer Snapchat and Instagram. However, Facebook is still used by millions of young people and Zuckerberg\u2019s company owns Instagram. There is also a sense in which Facebook has led the way in breaking down some of the behavioural distinctions between children, youths and adults, to the point that all social media users are acting like teenagers, and experiencing the same downsides of excessive use, whichever platform they favour.</p> <p>Put another way, endless performance, the craven pursuit of approval and worrying about what other people think of us might be quintessentially adolescent behaviour, but millions of people of a much more advanced age are doing exactly those things on a minute-by-minute basis, usually via Facebook. And in that context, the 15th anniversary of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s invention might be a good time to take a step back, and consider whether we are suffering from a huge outbreak of collective arrested development, with all the pain and dysfunction that entails.</p> <p>I don\u2019t often use Facebook, but I am a habitual tweeter, and I know that I post too much, and that it gets in the way of far too many experiences. By the same token, I am not sure that repeatedly changing one\u2019s Facebook profile picture in pursuit of two-word comments from your friends (such as \u201cGorgeous, babe\u201d) is behaviour that does anyone any good, but it definitely doesn\u2019t suit people much over 25. There is no need to write posts about what you just had for dinner, or the funny thing the dog did. Most of all, it seems incontestable that, whatever age we are, we need moments of quiet and introspection to reaffirm what it is to be alive, and that Facebook is something that too often spoils things.</p> <p>This is particularly true of the way we enjoy other people\u2019s creativity. A recent article on the music website the <a href=\"https://thequietus.com/articles/25909-mobile-phones-gigs-concerts-millennial\" title=\"\">Quietus by the writer Jazz Monroe</a> nails the essential point. \u201cWhen we submit to a profound experience of art, it\u2019s a rare reprieve from the everyday torrent of triviality and distraction,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLikewise, when you finish a great book, there\u2019s supposed to be a moment when you reflect on it. But it\u2019s so easy to just check your phone, or tweet some earnest statement about it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89b3bf3b9620941ee126bd2f7b5e3fddf9272ffd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89b3bf3b9620941ee126bd2f7b5e3fddf9272ffd/0_189_5673_3404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Have we lost the ability to be alone?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Have we lost the ability to be alone?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Mint Images RF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even in the company of other people, there are times when we need to withdraw into ourselves and savour an essentially private moment of transcendence.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Thefacebook is an online directory that connects people through social networks at colleges. We have opened up Thefacebook for popular consumption at Harvard University. You can use Thefacebook to: search for people at your school; find out who are [sic] in your classes; look up your friends\u2019 friends; see a visualization of your social network.\u201d On 4 February 2004, this rather clunky announcement launched an invention conceived in the dorm room of a Harvard student called Mark Zuckerberg, and intended to be an improvement on the so-called face books that US universities traditionally used to collect photos and basic information about their students. From the vantage point of 2019, Thefacebook \u2013 as it was then known \u2013 looks familiar, but also strange. Pages were coloured that now familiar shade of blue, and \u201cfriends\u201d were obviously a central element of what was displayed. However, there was little on show from the wider world: the only photos were people\u2019s profile pictures, and there was no ever-changing news feed. Everything on offer was centred on the lives of students: first at Harvard, then at Columbia, Stanford and Yale. On the face of it, the focus was campus dating and a feature whereby users could send each other \u201cpokes\u201d, whose meaning was open to interpretation, thus increasing the fun. Very quickly, though, something else happened. By the autumn of 2005, 85% of US college students were using the site with 60% of students visiting it daily. As they immersed themselves, Thefacebook tapped into the fierce social competitiveness that the US education system seems to be built on. As David Kirkpatrick\u2019s definitive history The Facebook Effect explains, users of the new site began to fixate on perfecting the details of their profile, not just to date, but to make themselves more attractive as potential friends. This came down to a handful of imperatives: \u201cFind exactly the right profile picture. Change it regularly. Consider carefully how you describe your interests.\u201d In fact, says Kirkpatrick, being a successful Facebooker soon became such a necessity that it began to affect choices people made in the real world: \u201cSince everyone\u2019s classes were listed, some students even began selecting what they studied in order to project a certain image of themselves. And many definitely selected classes based on who Thefacebook indicated would be joining them there.\u201d Everyone, it seemed, was performing, and the basic idea was to do as much performing as possible. At the end of 2004, Thefacebook reached a million users; in September 2006, having renamed itself Facebook, it moved beyond campuses and high schools, and opened itself up to anyone over 13 with an email address. But a core tenet of its Harvard beginnings remained: the imperative for users to present the world with the most flattering impression of themselves. Fifteen years after Facebook\u2019s birth, it has 2.2 billion users, Zuckerberg sits on a fortune of about $55bn (\u00a342bn), and this week the company posted a record profit of $6.88bn for the final three months of 2018. And we know one other thing for sure: tangled up in its success is the fact that people lie about themselves on Facebook, as they do on other social media platforms. In 2016, when the market research firm Custard surveyed 2,000 people in the UK, it found that only 18% of them said their Facebook profile accurately represented them, 31% said the face they presented on Facebook boiled down to \u201cpretty much my life but without the boring bits\u201d, and 14% said Facebook made them look \u201cmuch more\u201d socially active than they were. Men, it seemed, were more likely than women to knowingly depart from the truth: 43% admitted to fabricating some aspect of their online selves. That said, there is plenty of evidence of the same everyday deceit on the other side of the gender divide. Six years ago, the market research company OnePoll found that a third of women it surveyed admitted to \u201cdishonesty\u201d on social media. Almost one in four admitted to lying or exaggerating about key aspects of their life online between one and three times a month, and almost one in 10 said they lied more than once a week. Nearly 30% of women lied about doing something when they were really home alone, and 20% were not truthful about their holiday activities or their jobs. On the face of it, this may not seem that revelatory. It is, perhaps, in the nature of our relationships with other human beings that we work desperately hard on our outward presentation, and sometimes fall into a kind of performance that leads inexorably towards fibs. However, the Facebook age marks a break from traditional human behaviour in key aspect. In the past, we could regularly take a break from acting, and revert to some sense of our private, authentic selves. Now, as we constantly prod at our smartphones and feel the pull of their addictive apps, when does the performing ever stop? Along with Russian interference in elections, fake news, Facebook\u2019s approach to hate speech and its insatiable appetite for personal data, this is surely one of the most malign ways in which its presence in our lives is playing out. What its innovations have done to the divide between our social and private lives highlights a mess of stuff to do with the true meanings of intimacy and privacy, and something that goes even closer to the heart of what it is to be human: who we really are beyond the attention and judgments of others, and whether we even know any more. This demise of the barrier between our public and private selves is particularly relevant to people going through that stage of life when the very idea of \u201cself\u201d is still in flux: the often difficult period from the stirrings of adolescence to the mid-20s (and, if you\u2019re unlucky, even older). At that point, sensitivity to your peer group is at its height and an obsession with what some people call \u201csocial comparison\u201d tends to run deep. We all know the basics: you desperately want to meet all the requirements of whichever code of cool is holding sway, and avoid mockery at all costs. Looks are at their peak of importance. So are clothes. In her new doorstop-sized treatise on the dominance of Facebook and Google, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, the American academic Shoshana Zuboff gets to the heart of why social media collides with this stage of life in a particularly toxic way. \u201cSocial media marks a new era in the intensity, density and pervasiveness of social comparison processes especially for the youngest among us, who are \u2018almost constantly online\u2019 at a time of life when one\u2019s own identity, voice and moral agency are a work in progress,\u201d she writes. \u201cIn fact, the psychological tsunami of social comparison triggered by the social media experience is considered unprecedented.\u201d She calls this experience \u201clife in the hive\u201d, and rather chillingly characterises it as \u201cbeing alive in the gaze of others because it\u2019s the only life one has, even when it hurts\u201d. I remember what it was like being 16, and the minefield of peer pressure, ridicule and keeping up with the cool kids I had to navigate. Coming home each afternoon and having long spells to unwind was essential \u2013 in fact, it was in these daily quiet periods that I began to get some vague sense of who I was. If you had told me that in the near future, the noise of school would emanate from an addictive device that compelled me to carry on performing for my peers until I fell asleep, I would probably have screamed. Yet this is now the everyday reality for millions of teenagers, and we all know the likely consequences. According to a report published this week by the media regulator Ofcom, 70% of those aged 12 to 15 have at least one social media profile. Among those aged eight to 11, the figure is 18%. Ofcom says that children\u2019s most visible accounts tend to \u201cbe more highly curated, showing a \u2018picture-perfect\u2019 self\u201d. A substantial body of opinion links depression and anxiety to social media use, something routinely traced to online bullying and negative self-perception caused by reading other people\u2019s online posts. According to the Millennium Cohort Study led by the Institute of Education, London (which follows the life experiences of 19,000 people born at the start of the 21st century), almost 40% of girls who spend more than five hours a day on social media show symptoms of depression; research in 2017 by the Royal Society for Public Health recorded young people themselves suggesting that all the big social platforms had a negative effect on their mental wellbeing, something that health professionals said was bound up with increased feelings of inadequacy and anxiety.

      "bodyText": "The marsh tit, I was once told, looks as though it has come straight from the office, while the willow tit has just stumbled home from a three-day music festival. It is a memorable means of distinguishing these close cousins \u2013 the marsh just that little bit more sleek, the willow more raffish \u2013 but when the bird is nothing more than a wink of white cheek and black cap behind a scraggle of bramble, you\u2019re in no position to judge how smartly it\u2019s turned out. It\u2019s the call that\u2019s the real giveaway: the willow tit produces a high-pitched piping, hitched to a startling little rasp, almost a tit-sized caw. We were pleased to see this one here at a grey and frozen Fairburn. The willow tit has been in nationwide decline for decades. No one is entirely sure why, but it may have something to do with a shortage of young, wet woodland. There\u2019s plenty of that here \u2013 and the reserve\u2019s Poecile montanus population is defying the downturn. Fairburn Ings, on a bend of the Aire not far from Castleford, was a mineworks, once. These days, with the pits long flooded and the spoilheaps grown over, it\u2019s a likably ragged patchwork of water and copse, reedbed, heath and riverside. The crisply laundered whites of drake goldeneye and goosander break up the dark rippled gunmetal of the river surface. There\u2019s more stark monochrome on the frozen ponds: great black-backed gulls loiter on a dirt spit, while on the ice black-headed gulls \u2013 dainty beside the bull-necked black-backs \u2013 stand and socialise and perform slapstick red-legged cakewalks. High up in a leafless birch a great spotted woodpecker \u2013 more black and white \u2013 forages beneath the bark. It is left to another woodpecker, the green, or \u201cyaffle\u201d, to bring a splurt of colour to the scene: first we see it in up-and-downing flight across the water; then, later, it explodes from the undergrowth \u2013 where it was probably hunting ants \u2013 and perches at an obtuse angle on a limb of another bare tree. Garish and glaring, it looks, in this stripped-back landscape, about the size of a goose; in reality it\u2019s no bigger than a jackdaw, beak-to-tail, but the stats don\u2019t take personality into account.",

The fires, which actually run next to the rails, are used by Metra, the Chicago-area commuter rail, to make the rails expand in an attempt to avoid cracks forming and switches clogging. Temperatures in Chicago were expected to fall into the -20s F (-30s C) again on early Thursday, but should warm up to the comparatively balmy 20Fs (-7 to -2C) by Friday.",

      "bodyText": "The head of the royal commission into the Murray-Darling basin plan has recommended a complete overhaul of the scheme, including reallocating more water from irrigation to the environment. Releasing its report on Thursday, the South Australian Murray-Darling basin royal commission found the original plan ignored potentially \u201ccatastrophic\u201d risks of climate change. Bret Walker SC\u2019s report also found commonwealth officials had committed gross maladministration, negligence and unlawful actions in drawing up the multibillion-dollar deal to save Australia\u2019s largest river system. The investigation into the plan, prompted by allegations of water theft by New South Wales cotton farmers which first aired on the ABC in 2017, recommended major reform, including resetting water-saving limits, repealing the outcome of the northern basin review, dumping major projects, like the Menindee Lakes project, proposed by NSW, and new measurements for water on floodplains. The report comes as drought grips the Murray-Darling basin. Rivers have stopped flowing in north-west NSW, leaving some towns on severe water restrictions. Several major fish kills in NSW, including two of unprecedented scale at Menindee on the lower Darling, have resulted in hundreds of thousands of fish dying, leading to renewed questions about management of the river system by authorities. The lakes were drained twice in 2016 and 2017 as the drought hit. The 746-page report contained 111 findings and 44 recommendations. Walker was particularly critical of the plan\u2019s lack of consideration of climate change and has called for it to be central to a rewrite of the plan. He pointed to the 2008 CSIRO study which said the the southern basin would get warmer and drier, likely resulting in \u201csignificantly less run-off into the river systems in the 21st century\u201d. \u201cBased on the evidence of climate change experts, these projections are conservative \u2013 it is possible the reduction in run-off could be catastrophic ,\u201d he warned. He has also said the factors considered when the governments set the \u201cenvironmentally sustainable level of take\u201dpotentially render the plan invalid. \u201cThe Water Act requires environmental priorities to be given primacy when determining an ESTL,\u201d Walker said. Instead he found that the government had adopted what it calls a \u201ctriple bottom line\u201d approach, where it considered economic and social factors to reduce the recovery target for the environment. \u201cThat phrase is an inappropriate figure of speech or political slogan that the MDBA has unwisely adopted,\u201d he said. He warned that the plan was vulnerable to being declared invalid, though he rejected allegations that the commission was somehow encouraging this path. He also called for a fresh review of the northern basin, which had been subject to \u201cgross maladministration by the MDBA\u201d. \u201cIt is an example of how the current management of the MDBA has shown itself unwilling and incapable of fulfilling its statutory functions and obligations,\u201d he said. The decision to cut the amount of water recovered for the environment in the Northern Basin by 70 gigalitres was \u201cunlawful\u201d and should be dumped. He said unchallenged evidence from the Wentworth Group of scientists and others was that the Macquarie marshes and the Narran lakes were already degraded. He called for more water to be recovered from the environment and said that if the best available science was adopted, as the act required, there would need to be more buybacks from farmers in the northern basin. As for the southern basin, where the government is planning to achieve 605GL of water savings, the commissioner was equally critical. He said the program was \u201cbeyond the power\u201d of the MDBA and could cause \u201cserious adverse ecological impacts\u201d. He was particularly critical of the Menindee lakes project \u2013 NSW\u2019s main water saving project. It involves shrinking the lakes and emptying them more often to save water from evaporation. Locals and scientists have warned it will lead to an even greater ecological catastrophe than the fish kills in the adjacent river. Walker said it was \u201cproblematical\u201d that the project could meet the requirement that it produce \u201cequivalent environmental outcomes\u201d given its important role as a source of flows for the imperilled lower Darling and as a fish nursery. The insistence of NSW water minister, Niall Blair, that the project must proceed in the aftermath of the fish kills was \u201cgrossly irresponsible\u201d and his threat that blocking the project would blow up the basin plan itself was \u201cdesigned to menace\u201d. Walker also criticised the slow progress on developing water sharing plans \u2013 the nuts-and-bolts rules that underpin water sharing \u2013 saying NSW and Victoria had shown a lack of commitment. He also called for the states to review their water resource plans to expressly recognise and authorise the taking and use of water by Indigenous people in exercise of native title rights. The premier of South Australia, Steven Marshall, said his government, which is at the end of the river, would carefully consider all of the recommendations and would not make a rushed response. But as the state at the end of the river system, it has a greater stake in ensuring the plan works. Marshall asked the prime minister to call an urgent meeting of states and territories to discuss the way forward. Blair and the NSW deputy Premier, John Barilaro, who was in Menindee to inspect the site of the fish kills on Thursday, made it clear they would resist further cuts to the water entitlements of farmers, as recommended by the report. \u201cWe will fight tooth and nail for our rural and regional communities,\u201d the Nationals politicians said. \u201cThey need certainty. They need to know they have a future in the towns they love, communities they work in and the places they raise their families. \u201cThe gloves are off when it comes to fighting for our water rights.\u201d The MDBA said it was \u201cconfident the plan has been made lawfully and is based on best available science\u201d. It rejected \u201cany assertion that it has acted improperly or unlawfully in any way\u201d. The Australian Conservation Foundation urged governments to ensure that the plan complied with environmental obligations of national water law and took account of climate change science. \u201cDespite the denials of some politicians, industry figures and regulators, the royal commission has detailed significant failures by those charged with restoring our most important river system,\u201d said the ACF director, Dr Paul Sinclair. \u201cThe findings of the royal commission fit a consistent pattern of behaviour from Australian governments that has resulted in environmental disaster and the catastrophic loss of wildlife.\u201d The independent NSW MP Jeremy Buckingham said the Darling/Barka River was on the \u201cvery brink of no return\u201d, which showed that hard decisions needed to be taken.

      "body": "<p>Fifty-four years ago there was a demonstration involving about 30 university students, an old bus, and three or four \u201coutback\u201d New South Wales towns. These days <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/freedom-ride-50-years-on\">the 1965 Freedom Ride</a> is generally acknowledged as a significant event in Australia\u2019s cultural maturity. But we are not supposed to draw any parallels with similar Indigenous-led protests today.<br><br>Modelled on the Freedom Ride demonstration in the United States in 1961, Australia\u2019s version departed from Sydney on 12 February 1965 with a slightly different focus.<br><br>\u201cWhen the idea was taken up in Australia,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/resources/pdfs/37.pdf\">recalls the Freedom Rider and professional historian Ann Curthoys</a>, \u201cit had a much broader meaning \u2013 black and white students travelling together by bus to draw attention to all kinds of racial discrimination. Indeed our concern was not transportation, which was not segregated, but rather places of leisure in country towns \u2013 pools and picture theatres and RSL clubs \u2013 which were. We were also to draw attention to the appalling conditions under which Indigenous people lived, in shanty towns, on reserves and missions \u2026\u201d<br><br>One of the enduring interventions which occurred on that fortnight round-trip was the \u201cdesegregation\u201d of the pool in the north-western NSW town of Moree. Led by the legendary Arrernte man Charles Perkins, the activists first assembled out front of the town\u2019s council chambers to protest racial discrimination.<br><br>In her book, Freedom Ride: a Freedom Rider remembers , Curthoys writes: \u201cFor about an hour, we carried placards saying \u2018Hotels and clubs are integrated, but not baths\u2019, \u2018Are you proud of your council?\u2019, \u2018Color is not contagious\u2019, and \u2018Why whites Only?\u2019.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/30/culture-war-zone-how-news-corp-took-on-yumi-stynes\">Culture war zone: how News Corp took on Yumi Stynes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Next, the protest moved to the Moree Baths, where the activists were eventually successful in gaining entry for about 26 local Aboriginal kids who were otherwise banned by a 1955 council decree from swimming in the pool outside of school hours. A now iconic photograph of Perkins in the pool surrounded by joyous kids was taken by The Australian newspaper and the event was widely reported on by the nations news organisations.</p> <p>Understandably, there was opposition at the time from white Australia towards the Freedom Ride. The very concept challenged both the sensibilities and the status quo of white Australia by revealing how endemic racism was in the fledgling nation. This week, over half a century later, we\u2019ve observed how little those types of attitudes have changed.</p> <p>It would be mildly interesting to point out to veteran television personality Kerri-Anne Kennerley \u2013 who did her best to minimise and delegitimise Indigenous-led Australia Day protests from her platform on morning television on Monday \u2013 how civil rights and Aboriginal rights activists can and have always engaged on one seemingly minor issue while simultaneously being conscious of and engaging with much larger and numerous other issues.</p> <p>The \u201cChange The Date\u201d slogan is the equivalent of the \u201cWhy Whites only?\u201d placard in Curthoy\u2019s account, but Kennerley already knows that. Which makes the spectacle of her indignant pearl-clutching upon being called out by Studio 10 co-host Yumi Stynes as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/28/yumi-stynes-calls-kerri-anne-kennerley-racist-in-on-air-clash-over-australia-day\">\u201csounding quite racist\u201d</a> while reproaching the motives of 26 January protestors all the more intriguing.</p> <p>What Kennerley was attempting to do on Monday, and what the Studio program essentially attempted again with a segment in Tuesday\u2019s broadcast, happens each year around 26 January. We also observed a reiteration of it in News Corp\u2019s Daily Telegraph and I\u2019m confident the same chestnut was given a whirl or two on radio station 2GB and elsewhere on conservative talk-back programs around the country.<br><br>Over the years Black pundits have repeatedly drawn attention to the manoeuvre, and did so admirably again in multiple responses this week, but \u2013 surprise! \u2013 those useful evaluations are wilfully disregarded by people and organisations seeking to perpetuate tried and tested, and tired, media routines.</p> <p>On <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NITVAustralia/videos/2244445959165117/\">a recent episode of NITV\u2019s The Point</a>, themed on Indigenous protest, the panel discussed how these media routines and journalistic practices sought to delegitimise and perpetuate the marginalisation of Black voices.</p> <p>There is no active racist cabal at play in newsrooms or across media organisations to achieve this end \u2013 after all, as Indigenous media stalwart Stan Grant put it, \u201cthey aren\u2019t smart enough to exercise a conspiracy\u201d. Generally the media routines and practices that offend us are simply a symptom of an industry bereft of fresh ideas and cultural awareness when it comes to reflecting an increasingly complex society.<br><br>The befuddled, passive racism that results in the character and complexion of the bulk of our media is borne of equal parts arrogance, ignorance, fear, and fragility \u2013 escalated by the concern that its privilege is suddenly imperilled.<br><br>Watching Tuesday\u2019s episode of the Studio 10 program, I noted the gasps of dismay across the panel and studio audience, when Gunaikurnai<em><strong> </strong></em>and Gunditjmara woman Lidia Thorpe, video-linked to the Sydney studio from Melbourne, called out Kennerley\u2019s white privilege. What was immediately made clear was that Kennerley, the panel and the Studio 10 audience demonstrably lacked the requisite tool kit to responsibly host discussion on critical race politics.<br><br>But that\u2019s not to suggest that the Ten Network or other mainstream broadcast media should censor themselves from these discourses.

      "bodyText": "Fifty-four years ago there was a demonstration involving about 30 university students, an old bus, and three or four \u201coutback\u201d New South Wales towns. These days the 1965 Freedom Ride is generally acknowledged as a significant event in Australia\u2019s cultural maturity. But we are not supposed to draw any parallels with similar Indigenous-led protests today. Modelled on the Freedom Ride demonstration in the United States in 1961, Australia\u2019s version departed from Sydney on 12 February 1965 with a slightly different focus. \u201cWhen the idea was taken up in Australia,\u201d recalls the Freedom Rider and professional historian Ann Curthoys, \u201cit had a much broader meaning \u2013 black and white students travelling together by bus to draw attention to all kinds of racial discrimination. Indeed our concern was not transportation, which was not segregated, but rather places of leisure in country towns \u2013 pools and picture theatres and RSL clubs \u2013 which were. We were also to draw attention to the appalling conditions under which Indigenous people lived, in shanty towns, on reserves and missions \u2026\u201d One of the enduring interventions which occurred on that fortnight round-trip was the \u201cdesegregation\u201d of the pool in the north-western NSW town of Moree. Led by the legendary Arrernte man Charles Perkins, the activists first assembled out front of the town\u2019s council chambers to protest racial discrimination. In her book, Freedom Ride: a Freedom Rider remembers , Curthoys writes: \u201cFor about an hour, we carried placards saying \u2018Hotels and clubs are integrated, but not baths\u2019, \u2018Are you proud of your council?\u2019, \u2018Color is not contagious\u2019, and \u2018Why whites Only?\u2019.\u201d Next, the protest moved to the Moree Baths, where the activists were eventually successful in gaining entry for about 26 local Aboriginal kids who were otherwise banned by a 1955 council decree from swimming in the pool outside of school hours. A now iconic photograph of Perkins in the pool surrounded by joyous kids was taken by The Australian newspaper and the event was widely reported on by the nations news organisations. Understandably, there was opposition at the time from white Australia towards the Freedom Ride. The very concept challenged both the sensibilities and the status quo of white Australia by revealing how endemic racism was in the fledgling nation. This week, over half a century later, we\u2019ve observed how little those types of attitudes have changed. It would be mildly interesting to point out to veteran television personality Kerri-Anne Kennerley \u2013 who did her best to minimise and delegitimise Indigenous-led Australia Day protests from her platform on morning television on Monday \u2013 how civil rights and Aboriginal rights activists can and have always engaged on one seemingly minor issue while simultaneously being conscious of and engaging with much larger and numerous other issues. The \u201cChange The Date\u201d slogan is the equivalent of the \u201cWhy Whites only?\u201d placard in Curthoy\u2019s account, but Kennerley already knows that. Which makes the spectacle of her indignant pearl-clutching upon being called out by Studio 10 co-host Yumi Stynes as \u201csounding quite racist\u201d while reproaching the motives of 26 January protestors all the more intriguing. What Kennerley was attempting to do on Monday, and what the Studio program essentially attempted again with a segment in Tuesday\u2019s broadcast, happens each year around 26 January. We also observed a reiteration of it in News Corp\u2019s Daily Telegraph and I\u2019m confident the same chestnut was given a whirl or two on radio station 2GB and elsewhere on conservative talk-back programs around the country. Over the years Black pundits have repeatedly drawn attention to the manoeuvre, and did so admirably again in multiple responses this week, but \u2013 surprise! \u2013 those useful evaluations are wilfully disregarded by people and organisations seeking to perpetuate tried and tested, and tired, media routines. On a recent episode of NITV\u2019s The Point, themed on Indigenous protest, the panel discussed how these media routines and journalistic practices sought to delegitimise and perpetuate the marginalisation of Black voices. There is no active racist cabal at play in newsrooms or across media organisations to achieve this end \u2013 after all, as Indigenous media stalwart Stan Grant put it, \u201cthey aren\u2019t smart enough to exercise a conspiracy\u201d. Generally the media routines and practices that offend us are simply a symptom of an industry bereft of fresh ideas and cultural awareness when it comes to reflecting an increasingly complex society. The befuddled, passive racism that results in the character and complexion of the bulk of our media is borne of equal parts arrogance, ignorance, fear, and fragility \u2013 escalated by the concern that its privilege is suddenly imperilled. Watching Tuesday\u2019s episode of the Studio 10 program, I noted the gasps of dismay across the panel and studio audience, when Gunaikurnai and Gunditjmara woman Lidia Thorpe, video-linked to the Sydney studio from Melbourne, called out Kennerley\u2019s white privilege. What was immediately made clear was that Kennerley, the panel and the Studio 10 audience demonstrably lacked the requisite tool kit to responsibly host discussion on critical race politics. But that\u2019s not to suggest that the Ten Network or other mainstream broadcast media should censor themselves from these discourses. The solution is temporarily handing these platforms over to the sorts of identities that actually deal with these issues professionally and day-to-day. Evidenced by the number of incisive analysis and comment yesterday by Indigenous women in the media, a program like Studio 10 would be spoiled for choice and only have everything to gain by giving the likes of Kennerley and friends the flick for programs addressing Black issues and instead inviting in pundits like Amy Thunig, Chelsea Bond, Nat Cromb, Amy McGuire, Aretha Brown, Carla McGrath, Celeste Liddle, Nayuka Gorrie, Nakkiah Lui, Shannon Dodson, Teela Reid, Karen Wyld, Ruby Wharton, Josephine Cashman, in addition to Lidia Thorpe and Jacinta Price, and, indeed, Brooke Boney. Imagine the breadth of opinion, the depth of analysis and the understanding of issues like family violence in Australian culture, or the contestation of our national day, that could be shared with a general audience of morning viewers in that scenario.

Around the world, China, Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, New Zealand and the UK have all acted with various degrees of intervention to encourage their take-up.

Russians leaked evidence gathered by Robert Mueller, prosecutors say, in an effort to discredit his investigation into Moscow\u2019s interference in US politics. New Jersey Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman invited an undocumented immigrant who had spoken out about the abusive conditions she endured while working for the Trump Organization to be her guest at the president\u2019s State of the Union address next week. Three Democratic congressmen urged the Pentagon to revise a report on climate change, saying it omitted required items and \u201cfailed to meet basic requirements.\u201d God wanted Donald Trump to be president, according to Sarah Sanders. CNN is reporting that Sanders told the Christian Broadcasting Network that \u201cGod calls all of us to fill different roles at different times and I think that he wanted Donald Trump to become president, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s there.\u201d Earlier this month, former Ohio Governor John Kasich refused to sit in a \u201cless desirable seat\u201d and instead took comedian Julie Klausner\u2019s seat on a flight from New York to San Francisco. Today, Klausner took her sweet revenge on the Republican and staunch abortion opponent by raising thousands of dollars for Planned Parenthood. Klausner clearly had fun with the trolls, of which there were many, because, you know, Twitter. She also had some sweet moments in which people shared their experiences, and expressed support for her efforts and Planned Parenthood. Klausner ended up donating $2,774 of her own money, and $1,117 from donations through a GoFundMe. Trump administration claims of progress in talks with the Taliban have sparked fears that his impatience with the war in Afghanistan will lead him to withdraw troops too soon, the Associated Press is reporting, leaving the country at risk of returning to the same volatile condition that prompted the invasion in the first place. Discussions between a U.S. envoy and the Taliban are advancing weeks after the administration said it wanted to begin drawing down troops in Afghanistan. That has prompted some critics to note that President Donald Trump is telegraphing a withdrawal the same thing he accused President Barack Obama of doing by saying he wanted to end the American combat mission in 2014. \u201cIt\u2019s an effort to put lipstick on what will be a U.S. withdrawal,\u201d said Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Kabul under Obama. A negotiated settlement to America\u2019s longest war poses a dilemma for Trump. He has often declared he wants to end lengthy overseas military entanglements, something he made clear in December by declaring the Islamic State group defeated in Syria and announcing he was pulling 2,000 American troops from that country over the objections of his top foreign policy advisers. The stakes are higher in Afghanistan, a conflict that has cost 2,400 American lives and hundreds of billions in taxpayer dollars. The U.S. invaded the country to oust the Taliban and al-Qaida in October 2001 in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and the CIA director warned as recently as Tuesday that Afghanistan could once again become a terrorist haven. An undocumented immigrant who had spoken out about the abusive conditions she endured while working for the Trump Organization has been invited to the president\u2019s State of the Union address, the Associated Press is reporting. A spokeswoman for New Jersey Democratic congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman confirmed Wednesday that her guest will be Victorina Morales, who was born in Guatemala. Morales has spoken out about the Trump Organization\u2019s hiring practices. The Trump Organization said Wednesday that it will use the E-Verify electronic system at all its properties to check employees\u2019 documentation. Trump has repeatedly cast millions of immigrants in the country illegally as taking jobs from American citizens. He turned over day-to-day management of his business to sons Eric and Donald Jr. when he took office. The US Department of Energy has already shipped weapons-grade plutonium from South Carolina to a nuclear security site in Nevada, despite the state\u2019s protests, the Associated Press is reporting. The Justice Department notified a federal judge in Reno that the government trucked in half of the radioactive material that it intends to store at the site 70 miles (113 kilometers) north of Las Vegas. Nevada had filed a request for an injunction to block the move in November. Department lawyers said in a nine-page filing that the previously classified information about the shipment from South Carolina can be disclosed now because enough time has passed to protect national security. They didn\u2019t specify when the one-half metric ton of plutonium was transferred. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak said he\u2019s \u201cbeyond outraged by this completely unacceptable deception.\u201d He said he\u2019s working with Nevada\u2019s congressional delegation to fight back against the U.S. government\u2019s \u201creckless disregard\u201d for the safety of Nevadans. New charges and arrests are possible in the prosecution of a US Treasury Department employee accused of giving a BuzzFeed journalist confidential banking reports related to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe, the Associated Press is reporting. Treasury worker Natalie Edwards is awaiting trial on charges that she gave a BuzzFeed journalist reports about wire transfers made by Paul Manafort and other suspects in Mueller\u2019s investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kimberly Ravener told a New York judge during a hearing Wednesday that prosecutors will know within two to three months whether additional charges will be filed. She provided no other details as to who else might be under scrutiny. Edwards\u2019 lawyer, Jacob Kaplan, says his client is being prosecuted for \u201cdoing the right thing.\u201d Three Democratic congressmen are urging the Pentagon to revise a report on climate change, saying it omitted required items and \u201cfailed to meet basic requirements,\u201d Reuters is reporting. The Pentagon\u2019s report, released on Jan. 10, said climate change was a national security issue and listed 79 domestic military installations at risk from floods, drought, encroaching deserts, wildfires and, in Alaska, thawing permafrost. But the report, required by a defense policy law signed by President Donald Trump in 2017, did not include the top 10 list, and details of specific mitigation measures to make bases more resilient to climate change, including the costs. It also failed to list any Marine Corps bases or installations overseas. U.S. Representative Adam Smith, the chairman of the House committee, said the Trump administration\u2019s report was inadequate. \u201cIt demonstrates a continued unwillingness to seriously recognize and address the threat that climate change poses to our national security and military readiness,\u201d Smith said in a release. Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on the science of climate change, arguing that the causes and impacts are not yet settled. As a temporary blast of frigid cold hit the Midwest this week he said on Twitter \u201cWhat the Hell is going on with Global Wa(r)ming. Please come back fast, we need you!\u201d The letter, addressed to Acting Defense Department Secretary Patrick Shanahan and a copy of which was seen by Reuters, called the report \u201cdeeply disappointing.\u201d It requested a revised report by April 1. The report said major installations including Florida\u2019s MacDill Air Force Base, Virginia\u2019s Norfolk Naval Station, and California\u2019s Coronado Naval Base, face risks from flooding currently and in the future. In all, 53 installations already face flooding, it said. A federal judge is refusing to unseal criminal charges against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange that were mistakenly revealed in another case, the Associated Press is reporting. In a ruling issued Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said that free-press advocates seeking to unseal the charges have no proof Assange has actually been charged. The Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press sought to unseal the charges after a federal prosecutor inadvertently typed a reference to \u201cthe fact that Assange has been charged\u201d in an unrelated case. The government has acknowledged it made an error but has not publicly confirmed that charges against Assange have been filed. After the mistake was made, news outlets including The Associated Press reported Assange is indeed facing unspecified charges under seal. But those reports relied on anonymous sources. The Guardian\u2019s Jon Swaine is reporting that \u201cmore than 1,000 files shared confidentially appeared to have been uploaded to a filesharing site.\u201d Evidence gathered by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, was obtained by Russians and leaked online in an attempt to discredit his inquiry into Moscow\u2019s interference in US politics, prosecutors said on Wednesday. A court filing by Mueller\u2019s office said more than 1,000 files that it shared confidentially with attorneys for indicted Russian hackers later appeared to have been uploaded to a filesharing site and promoted by a Twitter account. \u201cWe\u2019ve got access to the Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s probe database as we hacked Russian server with info from the Russian troll case,\u201d a tweet from the account said. \u201cYou can view all the files Mueller had about the IRA and Russian collusion. Enjoy the reading!\u201d Read the full story here. Hey all, Vivian Ho on the West Coast, taking over for Ben Jacobs. Thanks for tuning in. The first meeting of the conference committee that is trying to reach a longterm Homeland Security funding agreement and avoid another government shutdown was held today President Donald Trump talked on the phone to Juan Guaido, the interim President of Venezuela. Lindsey Graham has raised concerns about the FBI\u2019s tactics in its arrest of Roger Stone last week. Kevin Stitt, Oklahoma\u2019s new elected Republican governor, has signaled that he is open to expanding Medicaid in the Sooner State. Fourteen states have yet to expand Medicaid under the provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Stitt, a conservative, said he would be opposed to doing so on the campaign trail but took a different tack speaking to reporters today with Republican leaders in the Oklahoma state legislature. Lindsey Graham, the new chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee has put out a statement asking the FBI for more information about the arrest of Roger Stone and raising questions about the Bureau\u2019s tactics. The pending government funding deadline has forced House Democrats to delay their annual retreat. Politico reports: Their annual gathering \u2014 the first in nearly a decade with House Democrats in the majority \u2014 is just the latest casualty of a funding stalemate that threatens to shutter government operations again in a few weeks. The retreat was set to take place in Leesburg, Va., on Feb. 13-15. But the three-week funding bill, which Congress cleared last week ending the longest shutdown in government history, expires on Feb. 15. \u201cAs you know, the conference committee has begun negotiations to keep the federal government funded beyond February 15,\u201d House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) wrote in a letter to colleagues Wednesday. \u201cGiven the critical importance of these efforts, we have decided to postpone our issues conference until a later date.\u201d Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, who refused to support Trump in 2016, says he\u2019ll support the President\u2019s re-election in 2020. Gardner, a first term senator, is one of two Republicans facing re-election in 2020 in a state that Hillary Clinton won. The other is Susan Collins of Maine. The first meeting of the conference committee for a longterm plan to fund border security and fund the government has ended after an hour. Government funding runs out on February 15. California Congressman Eric Swalwell says that he is close to a decision on a potential presidential bid. The Democrat is going to New Hampshire tomorrow. Someone apparently tried to disrupt a motorcade just now, leaving two people injured including one Secret Service officer. The 17-member conference committee trying to avoid another government shutdown has begun meeting in the Capitol. Nita Lowey, the chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said at the beginning of the meeting: \u201cWe can all agree that we must do everything we can to prevent another unnecessary and destructive government shutdown.\u201d As Texas is trending more purple, David Drucker at the Washington Examiner notes that it is not because of the state\u2019s growing Hispanic population but revulsion for Trump from upscale suburban whites. \u201cIt\u2019s the suburbs,\u201d Robin Armstrong, who represents Texas on the Republican National Committee, acknowledged in an interview with the Washington Examiner. \u201cThat\u2019s basically the woman\u2019s vote. We need to make sure that we\u2019re engaging females and letting them know that we\u2019re addressing their values and concerns.\u201d In 2018, Hispanic turnout in Texas rose by about 73 percent from 2014, according to a post-election review issued by Latino Victory Fund. But, as revealed by figures compiled by the Texas secretary of state, voter turnout overall increase a bit more, by about 77 percent. That would suggest the growing strength of Democrats in the state is not due to the rising Hispanic population. GOP political strategists in Texas, who keep close tabs on the electorate, say it is the significant shifts detected among whites that explain Republican leaders\u2019 anxiety about 2020. Politico has a deep dive into Trump\u2019s repeated Twitter insults of Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. Several senators, including the Connecticut senator himself, said they were at a loss as to why the president would respond to Blumenthal in such a fashion, even given Blumenthal\u2019s long-running animus toward the Trump administration. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask him. My only comment is \u2018there he goes again,\u2019 really too ludicrous to merit a response,\u201d Blumenthal said in an interview. Trump\u2019s beef against Blumenthal has many parts. There is his military service. But Blumenthal\u2019s in-laws and Trump share a tangled web, a family feud that goes back decades into the New York real estate scene and has accelerated the president\u2019s attacks on Blumenthal. The senator has admitted in the past he misstated serving in Vietnam, though he served in the Marine Corps Reserve during the war. \u201cTrump gets a bad rap for not serving in the military,\u201d said a former senior White House official, so when he realized Blumenthal had his own issue, the president \u201cseized\u201d on it. But Blumenthal\u2019s in-laws and Trump go way back in New York real estate circles. Trump and Blumenthal\u2019s father-in-law, Peter Malkin, were competitors in the Manhattan real estate market and eventually clashed over a deal involving control of the iconic Empire State Building. Donald Trump spoke with Venezuela\u2019s self-proclaimed interim president, Juan Guaid\u00f3, today. Trump also warned American citizens not to travel to the country. A representative of Guaid\u00f3 met with US officials earlier today about ensuring that Venezuelan government assets in the United States would be stripped from the control of the Maduro regime. Reuters reports that Carlos Vecchio, a representative of self-proclaimed interim Venezuelan president Juan Guaid\u00f3, has met with US officials about taking control of Venezuelan assets in the United States which are currently under control of the Maduro regime. There are reports that Maduro is trying to ship government gold out of Venezuela overseas in a Russian plane and the national security adviser, John Bolton, has issued a strong warning seeking to deal with Maduro as the regime sells off commodities. Although Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti bowed out of the 2020 presidential race, there are still a number of mayors considering a bid. South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is running as is former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro. Bill de Blasio is also considering a run. Todd Purdum at the Atlantic has a fascinating look back at the 1972 race which was the last Democratic primary to feature multiple mayors. As the first meeting of the conference committee on Homeland Security funding meets today on Capitol Hill, Breitbart is touting a poll that says 43% of Trump voters will desert him if a border wall is not built. Any funding for any kind of structure will allow Trump to claim he kept his central campaign promise. And although Democrats and the media know we need physical structures to protect our border, what is more important to both groups is preventing Trump from keeping that promise. They believe, and not without cause, that the fastest way to defeat Trump in 2020 is to destroy his base of support. Granted, we are a long way off from the 2020 presidential campaign \u2014 about 22 months and a thousand news cycles away. A lot can happen between now and then. Meaning, if Trump does not get the wall built, there are plenty of ways for him to rebuild his base of support. But \u201cBuild the Wall\u201d is Trump\u2019s \u201cRead My Lips: No New Taxes\u201d pledge. If Trump is unable to keep this promise, the same Democrats and media who worked tirelessly to ensure the wall was not built will gleefully turn around and taunt him for not keeping the promise his entire campaign was built on. The Seattle Times has dug into Howard Schultz\u2019s voting record and it\u2019s remarkably poor. Although Schultz has voted in every presidential race, he has missed a number of midterm elections as well as key state and local elections. By their metric, his voting record is significantly worse than another notable rich political neophyte who decided to run for the White House, Donald Trump There is competition in the 2020 Democratic primary for voters in all wings of the party. The AP reports: A Gallup survey this month found that 51 percent of Democrats identify as liberal \u2014 the highest percentage on record. But last month, Gallup found that 54 percent of Democrats want their party to be more moderate, while 41 percent want it to move left. Mark Mellman, a veteran Democratic pollster, said a more pragmatic primary bid wasn\u2019t a bad idea. \u201cThere\u2019s no question the greater energy is on the left in the party,\u201d Mellman said. \u201cBut if there are 20 people fighting over the left and you\u2019re fighting over the center, the person fighting over the center can win.\u201d That\u2019s what [former Colorado governor John] Hickenlooper is betting on. During his brief Iowa swing, he tried to sidestep ideological debates and described himself as a progressive who gets things done. He recounted how, as Denver mayor, he led a coalition of Democratic and Republican mayors of surrounding suburbs to support a sales tax increase to fund an expansion of regional light rail. As governor, he hammered out the nation\u2019s first limits on methane emissions from energy exploration during tough negotiations between environmentalists and oil and gas firms. Kamala Harris has picked up two more endorsements from members of the California congressional delegation from Katie Hill and Nanette Barragan The two join fellow California Democrat Ted Lieu in backing Harris. Only two other members of Congress have endorsed in the 2020 presidential primary so far. Joaquin Castro is supporting his brother Julian\u2019s candidacy and David Trone of Maryland is supporting John Delaney. After being dropped from the ticket, Jenean Hampton, the outgoing Republican lieutenant governor of Kentucky doesn\u2019t seem to be happy with her erstwhile running mate, Matt Bevin. Bevin faces re-election in November. Trump spoke to Venezuela\u2019s interim president Juan Guaid\u00f3 earlier today. Former UN ambassador Nikki Haley is now hitting the speaking circuit but at a high price. Defenders of Trump\u2019s immigration policy claiming hypocrisy on the left when Trump critics surround their houses with walls or fences. In a video series featured last night on Fox News, the Daily Caller\u2019s Benny Johnson goes to Los Angeles to point out that some celebrities who oppose a wall across the entire Mexican border have walls around their houses. President Donald Trump has been active on Twitter this morning. In addition to giving a travel advisory that Americans should not go to Venezuela, he has also weighed in on congressional negotiations about funding the government and border security. Good morning. The congressional conference committee negotiating to avoid another second government shutdown has its first meeting today, Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown will take another step towards a presidential bid with a \u201cDignity of Work\u201d event tonight in Ohio and Donald Trump has warned Americans not to travel to Venezuela until further notice. It\u2019s Wednesday in American politics.",

      "bodyText": "Maurizio Sarri has admitted he may not be equipped to motivate his players after seeing Chelsea suffer the heaviest league defeat of Roman Abramovich\u2019s ownership at Bournemouth. Sarri, who endured chants of \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing\u201d from Chelsea fans, kept his team in the dressing room for around an hour after the final whistle in an effort to understand why a game that had been goalless at half-time had unravelled so spectacularly. The defeat led to Chelsea dropping out of the top four on goal difference and places Sarri\u2019s position under scrutiny six months into a three-year contract. \u201cI think the players are good enough,\u201d said Sarri of his Carabao Cup finalists. \u201cMaybe we are not at the top of the Premier League at the moment but we are competitive. We cannot lose 4-0 against Bournemouth. I want to respect Bournemouth, and you know I like very much the coach Eddie [Howe] but it\u2019s impossible to lose 4-0 here.\u201d Asked if he was good enough, he added: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s my fault, maybe I\u2019m not able to motivate them. But the team is very strong, it is also able to win without the coach.\u201d Sarri had been critical of his players after the recent defeat by Arsenal in the hope to coax a positive reaction but, despite encouraging wins against Tottenham in the Carabao Cup semi-finals and Sheffield Wednesday in the fourth round of the FA Cup, this was a second successive league defeat. \u201cI feel frustrated, not under pressure,\u201d said Sarri, who asked his coaching staff to leave the dressing room post-match. \u201cI didn\u2019t see the signal of my work. So I am frustrated. I wanted to understand, so I spoke with the players immediately but it\u2019s very difficult for them to say why. So I have to try again tomorrow, because I need to solve this problem. \u201cI wanted to talk with them alone, without anybody else. It\u2019s impossible to play in such a different way between the first and second half. I don\u2019t understand why. I don\u2019t know exactly. \u201cWe have only to say sorry to our fans. We can lose, of course, in every match but not in this way. We need to solve the problem. We need to understand where the problem is.\u201d",

As more consumers drop all meat and dairy products from their diet for health or ethical reasons, the charity behind the annual event said the record figures and strong global support had made 2019\u2019s Veganuary the most popular since its launch in 2014. Many more people are thought to have taken part in the event without signing the official pledge. At the same time, Britain\u2019s supermarkets are reporting a surge in sales of vegan food and drink, which they expect to continue throughout the year.

In becoming an anthology show, which will spotlight one infamous case per series, A Very English Scandal follows in the footsteps of hits such as Charlie Brooker\u2019s Black Mirror and Ryan Murphy\u2019s American Crime Story, which has already covered the murder of Gianni Versace and the OJ Simpson trial, and will soon tackle the fallout from Hurricane Katrina. The Duchess of Argyll\u2019s divorce from the Duke in 1963 caused a furore because the court case included the explicit photographs, and the judge Lord Wheatley stated that the Duchess was \u201ca completely promiscuous woman\u201d. The courtroom was apparently supplied with a list of as many as 88 men with whom the Duke believed his wife had had affairs, allegedly including two government ministers and three members of the British royal family. The case went on to be overshadowed by the Profumo Affair the same year.",

The growth in unconditional offers has taken place since the government lifted the cap on undergraduate places for individual institutions in 2015. \u201cThe easiest and best way to tackle the increase in the use of unconditional offers is to move to a system where students apply to university after they receive their results,\u201d said Matt Waddup, head of policy for the University and College Union, which has called for an overhaul of the admissions system. Students in Scotland were excluded from the Ucas analysis, because many students there have received SQA Higher results at the time of their application. Ucas also released the results of an investigation into its use of fraud prevention software during admissions, which was found to disproportionately flag black applicants as suspect. Ucas said the fault had been caused by \u201chistorical\u201d data, and that it was working to improve its procedures.",
