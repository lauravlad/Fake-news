      "bodyText": "Sadiq Khan has endorsed proposals for a British slavery museum in London as a way of combating modern-day racism. The idea has been put forward by the Fabian Society, which says it could help address discrimination against London\u2019s black and minority ethnic population by challenging centuries-old tropes about racial inferiority. Describing the idea as \u201cwelcome and timely\u201d, London\u2019s mayor said: \u201cIt\u2019s right and fair that all Londoners see themselves and their history reflected in our city\u2019s museums and cultural institutions. \u201cLearning more about the uncomfortable nature of our city and our nation\u2019s role in the transatlantic slave trade can serve to deepen our understanding of the past and strengthen our commitment to fight racism and hatred in all its forms.\u201d The proposal, made in the Fabian Society\u2019s capital gains report published on Monday, makes several recommendations for Khan\u2019s second term as London mayor should he be re-elected next year. In a chapter on race equality, Omar Khan, the director of the Runnymede Trust, wrote: \u201cUntil and unless Britain comes to terms with this history it will be impossible to understand much less eradicate the views that continue to justify racial inequalities today. \u201cIt is unacceptable that the capital city of a nation that built a global empire and its wealth in large part as a result of its role in the slave trade has no significant museum or monument marking the role that London and Britain played in these historic atrocities.\u201d London was one of the three most important British ports in the slave trade, along with Bristol and Liverpool \u2013 home to the International Slavery Museum \u2013 which all became extreme wealthy as a result. At the same time the British economy was heavily dependent on Caribbean sugar, grown on slave plantations in its colonies. Omar Khan said history dictated that the government and London\u2019s financial sector had a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to help fund a museum. Anti-racism activists have long complained the discourse around the British slave trade has been dominated by the nation\u2019s role in its abolition, particularly that of William Wilberforce, rather than its role in atrocities spanning more than 200 years. The Runnymede director wrote: \u201cWe gain greater moral reflection from considering the times in the past when we failed to live up to the values of humanity, freedom and democracy than we do when we portray ourselves as always being on the right side of history.\u201d The proposal comes at a time when racism is increasing, amid fears the polarised Brexit debate has legitimised abuse in some people\u2019s eyes, and as social media provides a convenient platform for the dissemination of hate speech. Boris Johnson has faced criticism for his past use of terms including \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d to describe African people, a derogatory word which was often used to refer to the children of African slaves. David Olusoga, historian and presenter of the BBC Two documentary, Britain\u2019s Forgotten Slave Owners, endorsed the proposed museum. He said: \u201cThe impact of the slave trade and enslavement is already stamped onto the fabric of London, but in ways we have learnt not to notice. \u201cBritain played a central role in the Atlantic slave trade and the fortunes built on the back of slavery flowed back to Britain. A new museum, in the heart of the city, would help us to acknowledge a history that for the most part is hidden in plain sight.\u201d Toyin Agbetu, who disrupted the 2007 commemorations to mark the 200th anniversary of abolition in protest at the failure to apologise for slavery or commemorate resistance by the African people, also gave the idea his backing, providing it was done in the right way. Agbetu, from the British-based African rights organisation Ligali, said: \u201cWithout recognising the pain and trauma that\u2019s been done by slavery there\u2019s this collective amnesia. I am definitely in favour of something like a museum but it has to be done in a way that is not simply reducing the entirety of African history to a story of victimhood.\u201d He also said a museum could help inform the debate about reparations in the UK.",

      "body": "<p>Don\u2019t despair. We may be living through an attempted rightwing revolution, but its foundations are rotten. There may be a counter-revolution, as there is after every revolution, and it will be built on much firmer ground. The charlatans may be in control in both Britain and the US, but their time is limited. Their programmes are self-defeating and destructive and they do not speak to the dynamic and increasingly ascendant forces in both our societies.</p> <p>What has happened in the US after the atrocities in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/09/el-paso-shooting-suspect-confessed-attack-mexicans\" title=\"\">El Paso </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/aug/06/trump-obama-news-today-el-paso-shooting-dayton-ohio-politics-latest\" title=\"\">Dayton </a>is instructive. It is a tipping point. The National Rifle Association may tell Donald Trump repeatedly that any attempt at gun control will not fly with his political base, but Trump can read the runes. For the Republicans to become the party in de facto defence of what has suddenly become crystallised as white supremacist terrorism would be electoral suicide. The president has to move, not least because, faced with this reality, even his base is shifting. Too many Americans now fear becoming the victims of random murder.</p> <p>Few can dispute that, astonishingly, while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/us-gun-control-ownership-violence-statistics\" title=\"\">US has 5% of the world\u2019s population, it has 35%-50% of civilian gun ownership,</a> a trend that simply has to be reversed. Within a decade, I am sure, the debate will move on, as white supremacists continue their killing spree, from hardening background checks to debating the constitutional right to bear arms. This must and will happen and it will highlight the marginalisation of rightwing republicanism. And when the political wind changes in the US, it also changes in Britain.</p> <p>Trump in the US and Boris Johnson in the UK are the extreme culmination of what Reagan and Thatcher began 40 years ago. It started as a legitimate if contestable desire to reframe the postwar settlement, limit the state, promote business and individual self-reliance. But as the great political scientist Samuel Beer famously argued, it was, paradoxically, supported culturally by the individualism, anti-state instincts and nonconformism of the Woodstock generation.</p> <p>Forty years on, continued rightwing political ascendancy has morphed into today\u2019s menacing rightwing ideologies. The role of US republicanism as the libertarian champion of guns is matched by the descent of the Conservative party into English nationalism, with a no-deal Brexit as its talismanic policy, even if it means breaking up the UK. But a no-deal Brexit will become an inflection point for a parallel fightback in Britain. The devastating economic and political consequences \u2013 a long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/22/no-deal-brexit-uk-recession-niesr-british-eu-trade\" title=\"\">recession</a>, a broken housing market, collapsed sterling, chronically unfair trade deals \u2013 will inevitably raise the question of how it ever happened. Suddenly, the British constitution, the long sleeper issue in British politics, will become the new political battleground.</p> <p>Britain is almost alone in having no written constitution. Whoever commands a majority in the House of Commons can do what they like without constitutional constraint \u2013 hold a referendum transforming Britain\u2019s treaty obligations with no requirement for a super-majority or ignore a no-confidence vote in the House of Commons for long enough to deliver a no-deal Brexit. The constitution does empower the monarch to assert fair play and the public interest, but a non-elected head of state can never actually act.</p> <p>This is no longer sustainable. We needed the Queen to insist that a referendum as important as that on EU membership required a super-majority; we will need her to sack Boris Johnson if he tries to stay in office after losing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/06/no-deal-brexit-legally-possible-even-after-no-confidence-vote\" title=\"\">no-confidence vote </a>or to time a general election for after 31 October, so bypassing the Commons to effect a no-deal Brexit. But she knows she can only act politically once. If she sacks Johnson she makes enemies of the English nationalists; if she doesn\u2019t, she makes enemies of everyone else. Either way, her legitimacy is ruined. Only an elected head of state has the legitimacy to hold the ring at times like these \u2013 facing electoral consequences if they get it wrong.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The case for the EU will be as an agent for Europe-wide sustainability</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The question of how we want to be governed is no longer abstract: it goes to the heart of giant new cultural forces that want good government. The generations championing individualistic hedonism and social atomisation \u2013 the unwitting cultural accomplices of the right \u2013 are being succeeded by the Extinction Rebellion generation who are rediscovering collectivism. As the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/08/climate-crisis-reducing-lands-ability-to-sustain-humanity-says-ipcc\" title=\"\">last week spelled out</a>, how we all collectively behave, in particular the food we consume, will be crucial in determining the future of life. Livestock are environmentally dangerous. Around the world, there is a boom in substitutes for meat, as consumers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/16/new-plant-focused-diet-would-transform-planets-future-say-scientists\" title=\"\">switch to plant-based diets</a> \u2013 including 39% of US consumers.</p> <p>Nor is it just eating. Decisions on everything from the use of plastics to the frequency of flying have a collective and awesome impact on everyone, particularly those young enough to expect to see the end of the century.</p> <p>Companies are finding their record on sustainability is under the microscope as never before. Whether public utilities or global multinationals in the fossil fuel or food businesses, no one escapes the new requirement to do business sustainably. This dynamic is driving the imperative to reshape capitalism around stakeholder principles.</p> <p>But only so much can come from pressure from below: governments must act from above and how we are governed is moving to the centre of the political debate. Wise and activist government \u2013 checked, balanced, accountable, sufficiently federal to accommodate the demands of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and serviced by an impartial civil service \u2013 is going to be crucial in creating a greener society, a reformed capitalism and reduction of disfiguring inequalities.</p> <p>The need for such governance will extend internationally. The case for the EU will increasingly be as an agent for Europe-wide sustainability: the ESU \u2013 European Sustainable Union. Its actions will become the global standard-setter for the environment. If we leave the EU, at the heart of the case for rejoining will be the need to make the greening of our continent a common cause.</p> <p>So don\u2019t despair. The no-deal Brexiters do not have the force behind them, any more than does Trump. They are losers, on the wrong side of history. Better people will enter politics. Old parties will be rejuvenated: new ones take life. There will be a counter-revolution \u2013 it\u2019s already in the making.</p> <p>\u2022 Will Hutton is an Observer columnist</p>",

There may be a counter-revolution, as there is after every revolution, and it will be built on much firmer ground. The charlatans may be in control in both Britain and the US, but their time is limited. Their programmes are self-defeating and destructive and they do not speak to the dynamic and increasingly ascendant forces in both our societies. What has happened in the US after the atrocities in El Paso and Dayton is instructive. It is a tipping point. The National Rifle Association may tell Donald Trump repeatedly that any attempt at gun control will not fly with his political base, but Trump can read the runes. For the Republicans to become the party in de facto defence of what has suddenly become crystallised as white supremacist terrorism would be electoral suicide. The president has to move, not least because, faced with this reality, even his base is shifting. Too many Americans now fear becoming the victims of random murder. Few can dispute that, astonishingly, while the US has 5% of the world\u2019s population, it has 35%-50% of civilian gun ownership, a trend that simply has to be reversed. Within a decade, I am sure, the debate will move on, as white supremacists continue their killing spree, from hardening background checks to debating the constitutional right to bear arms. This must and will happen and it will highlight the marginalisation of rightwing republicanism. And when the political wind changes in the US, it also changes in Britain. Trump in the US and Boris Johnson in the UK are the extreme culmination of what Reagan and Thatcher began 40 years ago. It started as a legitimate if contestable desire to reframe the postwar settlement, limit the state, promote business and individual self-reliance. But as the great political scientist Samuel Beer famously argued, it was, paradoxically, supported culturally by the individualism, anti-state instincts and nonconformism of the Woodstock generation. Forty years on, continued rightwing political ascendancy has morphed into today\u2019s menacing rightwing ideologies. The role of US republicanism as the libertarian champion of guns is matched by the descent of the Conservative party into English nationalism, with a no-deal Brexit as its talismanic policy, even if it means breaking up the UK. But a no-deal Brexit will become an inflection point for a parallel fightback in Britain. The devastating economic and political consequences \u2013 a long recession, a broken housing market, collapsed sterling, chronically unfair trade deals \u2013 will inevitably raise the question of how it ever happened. Suddenly, the British constitution, the long sleeper issue in British politics, will become the new political battleground. Britain is almost alone in having no written constitution. Whoever commands a majority in the House of Commons can do what they like without constitutional constraint \u2013 hold a referendum transforming Britain\u2019s treaty obligations with no requirement for a super-majority or ignore a no-confidence vote in the House of Commons for long enough to deliver a no-deal Brexit. The constitution does empower the monarch to assert fair play and the public interest, but a non-elected head of state can never actually act. This is no longer sustainable. We needed the Queen to insist that a referendum as important as that on EU membership required a super-majority; we will need her to sack Boris Johnson if he tries to stay in office after losing a no-confidence vote or to time a general election for after 31 October, so bypassing the Commons to effect a no-deal Brexit. But she knows she can only act politically once. If she sacks Johnson she makes enemies of the English nationalists; if she doesn\u2019t, she makes enemies of everyone else. Either way, her legitimacy is ruined. Only an elected head of state has the legitimacy to hold the ring at times like these \u2013 facing electoral consequences if they get it wrong. The question of how we want to be governed is no longer abstract: it goes to the heart of giant new cultural forces that want good government. The generations championing individualistic hedonism and social atomisation \u2013 the unwitting cultural accomplices of the right \u2013 are being succeeded by the Extinction Rebellion generation who are rediscovering collectivism. As the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last week spelled out, how we all collectively behave, in particular the food we consume, will be crucial in determining the future of life. Livestock are environmentally dangerous. Around the world, there is a boom in substitutes for meat, as consumers switch to plant-based diets \u2013 including 39% of US consumers. Nor is it just eating. Decisions on everything from the use of plastics to the frequency of flying have a collective and awesome impact on everyone, particularly those young enough to expect to see the end of the century. Companies are finding their record on sustainability is under the microscope as never before. Whether public utilities or global multinationals in the fossil fuel or food businesses, no one escapes the new requirement to do business sustainably. This dynamic is driving the imperative to reshape capitalism around stakeholder principles. But only so much can come from pressure from below: governments must act from above and how we are governed is moving to the centre of the political debate. Wise and activist government \u2013 checked, balanced, accountable, sufficiently federal to accommodate the demands of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and serviced by an impartial civil service \u2013 is going to be crucial in creating a greener society, a reformed capitalism and reduction of disfiguring inequalities. The need for such governance will extend internationally. The case for the EU will increasingly be as an agent for Europe-wide sustainability: the ESU \u2013 European Sustainable Union. Its actions will become the global standard-setter for the environment. If we leave the EU, at the heart of the case for rejoining will be the need to make the greening of our continent a common cause. So don\u2019t despair. The no-deal Brexiters do not have the force behind them, any more than does Trump. They are losers, on the wrong side of history. Better people will enter politics. Old parties will be rejuvenated: new ones take life. There will be a counter-revolution \u2013 it\u2019s already in the making. \u2022 Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",
