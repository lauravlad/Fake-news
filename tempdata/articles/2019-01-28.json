      "bodyText": "Right, that\u2019s it from me. Here\u2019s Paul Doyle\u2019s match report from a buzzing Hive: Here\u2019s Dan Sparkes: \u201cI\u2019m known for a set piece but they\u2019re hard to get right. I did what I could.\u201d Nice line in understatement from the matchwinner there. Peep! PEEP!! PEEEEEP!!! All over. What a terrific Cup tie. Pretty much a fair result I\u2019d say. These two will have to do it all over again in a week or two. 90+6 min: Sawyers beautifully picks out the run of Dalsgaard who is in behind the Barnet backline \u2026 but he\u2019s there because he\u2019s offside. And that should be that. 90+5 min: Into the final minutes of minimum added time \u2026 90+4 min: \u2026 poked goalwards by Konsa but the effort drifts wide. 90+3 min: Odubajo forces a corner \u2026 90+2 min: Barnet have settled for the replay here, understandably. Brentford \u2026 not so much. 90 min: Another Barnet sub: Boucaud comes on for Elito. And the fourth official indicates there\u2019ll be a minimum of five minutes added time. 89 min: Handbags! Right in front of the Brentford fans who are massed behind the goal. Maupay, slightly naughtily, shoves Taylor into the hoardings and the midfielder reacts angrily. The referee speaks to both, who are equally culpable. No bookings, no bother. 87 min: For the THIRD time in the game Brentford hit the inside of the post. Obubajo forces his way through and sees his shot come back off the woodwork and ping across goal. 85 min: Benrahma tests Huffer from the edge of the box but the keeper is equal to it. 83 min: Benrahma curls an effort a yard wide from the edge of the box with Huffer at full stretch. 82 min: Brentford look like scoring every time they have the ball at this stage. Dalsgaard, in particular, has made a difference. Can Barnet hold out and/or nick one? 80 min: Another fine chance for Brentford. Canos\u2019s shot hits his own player \u2013 Barbet, who needs treatment afterwards \u2013 full in the face and Konsa batters the rebound off towards Canons Park tube station. 79 min: Cracking save from Huffer as Barnet\u2019s midfield goes AWOL. Maupay\u2019s shot it tipped over the bar. 78 min: Brentford sub: Watkins off, Benrahma on. I doubt the goalscoring has finished here. 76 min: It\u2019s almost 4-3 within seconds! Dalsgaard climbs highest and his header floats a foot wide of the post. This is just superb entertainment. Holy moly! Sparkes lets fly and it\u2019s a quite brilliant strike. What a hit! Off the underside of the bar and in! 74 min: Coulthirst wins a free-kick right on the left corner of the Brentford box \u2026 Ah, the first bit of real quality from Brentford and it puts them 3-2 up. Dalsgaard picks out Canos, who is charging through the middle. He takes a lovely touch to move the ball away from a sliding defender then calmly tucks the ball home. 69 min: Subs: Henry off, Dalsgaard on for Brentford. And Fonguck off, Sparkes on for Barnet. 68 min: Rico Henry\u2019s cross is well cut out by Johnson. I\u2019d be stunned \u2013 stunned, I tell you \u2013 if we don\u2019t get at least one more goal here. 66 min: A terrific move from Barnet \u2013 the increasingly impressive Mason-Clarke finding Alexander, whose cross is nodded straight at Daniels by Coulthirst. 64 min: A final replay from behind the goal suggests that was certainly a dive from Watkins. Barnet need to get the injustice out of their minds, though \u2013 this is still there for the taking. 63 min: \u2026 Daniels claims it but in the process he\u2019s injured two of his defenders. Both very gingerly get to their feet. 62 min: The more replays you see, the more that looks a dive from Watkins. No matter now, we\u2019re back at all square and Barnet have a corner \u2026 Maupay calmly finishes low to bring Brentford level. 59 min: Tutonga trips Watkins amid a huge scramble \u2026 or does he? Replays suggest not but the referee has pointed to the spot \u2026 57 min: Wow. Jeanvier overhits a cross-field ball by about 30 yards. Brentford brains are frazzled. Deep breath required. 55 min: The Hive is bouncing now. A crazy 10 minutes. Brentford\u2019s defending has been dire since the break. 54 min: This is remarkable. Six Brentford defenders fail to deal with a routine cross and after a brief, mad scramble the ball breaks to that man Coulthirst, who slams the ball home. It\u2019s 2-1! Oh my word! The National League side are level! Mason-Clarke finds some space in the right channel, tries a few stepovers then fires the ball in to Coulthirst. And the man who scored the winner at Bramall Lane in the third round pokes home to send the home fans wild. 48 min: \u201cI\u2019m not very footbally but keep an eye on Brentford because my Dad alleged that he was the junior team goalie somewhere in the time of Ron Greenwood and Jimmy Hill,\u201d writes Peter Gibbs. \u201cI realise by telling you this that other MBMers may debunk this claim. Then again, my dad also told me that I was supposed to be made a director of Leyton Wingate but the owner (?) died on the golf course before he made it happen.\u201d 47 min: \u2026 which is cleared. Rather brilliantly there\u2019s a microphone somewhere in the ground that is picking up a Barnet fan or possibly coach who is screaming \u2013 and I mean screaming \u2013 at the home players. 46 min: Watkins forces a corner \u2026 Peep! Off we go again. The players are back out. Second half here we come! An email! Here\u2019s Neal Butler: \u201cYour earlier comment about Europe playing The Final Countdown three times reminded me of this old sketch from Big Train.\u201d Some half-time Big Train for you all. Lovely. Peep! PEEEEEP!! That\u2019s half-time. Barnet aren\u2019t out of this, not by a long chalk. 45 min: There\u2019ll be a minimum of two minutes of added time. Barnet don\u2019t want half-time at the moment, though. They\u2019ve been great since falling behind. 44 min: Mason-Clarke gets in behind on the Barnet right but his cut-back falls between three teammates. That was a chance. 43 min: Coulthirst does brilliantly on the break, flicking a long ball on and then getting on the end of it himself. Barbet does brilliantly to get back and challenge the striker and when the ball breaks to Taylor he thrashes the ball wide. 41 min: Robson pings an effort at goal from distance but it\u2019s high and wide. And the Championship side take the lead. Maupay was guilty of holding on to the ball too long a moment or two ago, but Watkins lets fly from close to 30 yards out and sees his effort zip past Huffer and nestle in the bottom corner. 38 min: Maupay picks Sweeney\u2019s pocket and is through on goal but Barnet scramble back to deny the striker space. 37 min: The first yellow card of the game goes to Odubajo, who is guilty of pulling back an opponent as Barnet break. 35 min: Here\u2019s the full draw for round five: 33 min: There\u2019s a pause for breath as Tutonda gets some treatment for a knock. He\u2019s fine to continue. 30 min: Mason-Clarke gets half a sight of goal as Coulthirst causes havoc in the Brentford defence. His shot is weak, though, and Daniels gathers. 29 min: \u201cLook no further than the 64th Grey Cup, the final game of the Canadian Football League\u2019s 1976 season where the Ottawa Rough Riders faced the Saskatchewan Roughriders,\u201d writes Glenn Shepherd. \u201cOttawa won 23-20!\u201d 28 min: Brilliant block from Alexander as the ball drops to Canos on the edge of the Barnet box. This is a cracking Cup tie. 27 min: That goes down as a great chance for the home side. It was a fine save but Sweeney will think he shouldn\u2019t have given him the chance. 26 min: \u2026 Sweeney meets it with a thumping header that Daniels does superbly to turn away. 25 min: Taylor does superbly to skitter onto Robson\u2019s pass and cut back across goal. Cleared. Corner to Barnet \u2026 22 min: A stunning effort from Odubajo cannons back off the woodwork! The Brentford wing-back cuts inside and spanks a curling effort onto the inside of the same post that Barbet hit earlier. Almost the same spot in fact. Again the ball pings across goal and away to safety. 20 min: Da Silva cuts inside and hammers a shot at goal \u2013 it\u2019s straight down Huffer\u2019s throat and the keeper gathers despite an awkward bounce. 19 min: Johnson clears as Henry fires in another low cross. Barnet desperately need to release the pressure. 17 min: Brentford are just beginning to crank up the pressure. Rico Henry threatens on the left and it takes some scrambling in the Barnet backline to clear. 15 min: Maupay gets his foot on the ball, on the half-turn, inside the Barnet box but Sweeney is across quickly to smother the danger. 14 min: It\u2019s all got a little bit scrappy, which will suit the non-league team just fine. 11min: Canos\u2019s throughball towards Maupay is overhit but a moment or two later Sweeney nips in to cut out a a dangerous header from Watkins. 9 min: \u2026 my word, how did that stay out? Watkins delivers to the near post where Barber flicks on with his head. The effort thuds onto the inside of the near post and bounces away across goal to safety. 8 min: \u2026 Barbet slaps his first effort into the wall, then sees his follow-up deflected away for a Brentford corner \u2026 7 min: Watkins is hauled down on the edge of the Barnet area by Robson. A very dangerous position this \u2026 6 min: \u201cBristol City v Swindon \u2013 The Robins v The Robins,\u201d suggests Don Blandford. Is there a ground called The Nest or similar? 5 min: Barnet have started vert well here. Elito sidefoots in a cross but it\u2019s far too close to Daniels. 4 min: Elito looks to get away down the Barnet left but is outmuscled by Konsa. 2 min: \u2026 a Brentford head meets it and the Championship side look to break but it comes to nothing. 1 min: \u201cMillwall v Guiseley?\u201d suggests Michael Watson. \u201cLions v Lions at the Den.\u201d Yes, absolutely. Meanwhile, Barnet have started on the front foot and have an early corner \u2026 Peep! Off we go then. The players emerge from the tunnel to the guitar intro of Sweet Child Of Mine. The fact that it this is the Bees facing the Bees at the Hive is obviously pleasing \u2013 I\u2019m racking my brain to think of any other nickname v nickname at [insert apt ground] examples but I\u2019ve got nothing. Please help: john.ashdown@theguardian.com Europe\u2019s The Final Countdown blares out at the Hive. A colleague of mine here at Guardian Towers once went to see Europe live in convert and they played The Final Countdown three times, which always strikes me as a) hilarious and b) absolutely understandable. The winner of this game faces a trip to Swansea in the fifth round. It\u2019s finally time for surely the tie of the round (on one level at least): The Bees v The Bees at the Hive. It\u2019s been 10 years since these sides were in the same division but the last time the teams met was just over seven years ago and also came in a cup competition, with Barnet dumping Brentford out of the JPT on penalties after a 0-0 draw at Underhill. And just for belt-and-braces, historical fact fans, Barnet have never \u2013 NEVER \u2013 beaten Brentford inside 90 minutes. That said, they\u2019d never beaten Sheffield United before and happily ousted the Blades in the third round with a superb performance at Bramall Lane. While Barnet were providing one of the shocks of the round, Brentford were squeezing past League One Oxford thanks to a late Neal Maupay penalty at Griffin Park. That game, though, has proven the first of a three-match winning run and Thomas Frank\u2019s side haven\u2019t lost since 15 December. That has pushed Brentford away from the Championship relegation zone, so it\u2019s 17th in the National League v 18th in the Championship this evening \u2013 a gap of 70 league places by my count. It could be very interesting. Kick off is at 7.45pm GMT but before that, come join me over here for the FA Cup fifth round draw.",

The high level of vitriol and abuse on the royal family\u2019s platforms has meant staff have to spend several hours a week moderating and deleting posts, which include racist and sexist abuse as well as threatening remarks. Officials have now sought help from Instagram to deal with the problem. Some of the worst, hate-filled personal abuse is said to be between competing camps that support Kate or Meghan, fuelled by some media reporting that pits the women as rivals.

Monday\u2019s action is the latest in a series of strikes and actions by teachers, who have been mobilized following successful teachers\u2019 strikes in West Virginia, Oklahoma, Arizona and Los Angeles that have inspired a new movement nationwide.

Anyone could run for office and win! As I got older, I saw how this wasn\u2019t <em>really</em> the case. To win an election you need to be part of the establishment. Maybe this isn\u2019t quite the meritocracy I was sold? (Also, slaveholders wanting to be free: what\u2019s up with that?)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/27/wheres-my-roy-cohn-review-damning-documentary-on-villainous-lawyer\">Where's my Roy Cohn? review \u2013 damning documentary on villainous lawyer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recent elections have upended the system. Donald John Trump, mouth-breathing narcissistic xenophobe he may be, does (and I really hate admitting this) somewhat live up to the \u201canyone can do it!\u201d promise I was taught as a child. A complete novice from outside the political class bankrolled (and steamrolled) himself into the White House. He\u2019s a disaster, but his victory is undeniably remarkable. But the pendulum swings back, and two years later a young bartender from the Bronx pulled her own upset, using nothing but wit, will, knowledge, perseverance and confidence, and did it with practically no money. The victory of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over the entrenched political \u201cboss\u201d Joe Crowley isn\u2019t quite winning the presidency, but Rachel Lears\u2019 documentary Knock Down The House rolls up its sleeves to show just how extraordinary her campaign was.</p> <p>Lears follows AOC and three other insurgent, nothing-to-lose female candidates \u201cprimary\u201d-ing longtime incumbents from the left. They include Cori Bush, an African American woman in the Missouri district where unarmed teen Michael Brown was killed by police officers in 2014, Paula Jean Swearengin, a West Virginia woman whose community has been upended by fracking, and Amy Vilela, a no-nonsense Las Vegas woman who went from being a single mother on food stamps to having a C-suite position whose core issue is healthcare. (Her daughter passed away after being refused treatment for not having the right insurance.) All four were \u201cselected\u201d (though it\u2019s a little fuzzy how) by the groups Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress as part of a push for diversity in political representation.</p> <p>The bulk of this spry, under-90-minutes film is on AOC. How could it not? She\u2019s an international superstar and ratings-driver for both leftwing and rightwing cable news. While this is not Frederick Wiseman-esque pure \u201cdirect cinema\u201d there are enough sequences that lean into that fly-on-the-wall type of film-making. As such, one comes away with really knowing what makes AOC tick, proving that she really is as good as she seems on TV and social media. (Also we get to meet her boyfriend, which was a first for me; he seems quite nice.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98fab2d39c9f5affeff1d84b88c81d58c0f91c17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98fab2d39c9f5affeff1d84b88c81d58c0f91c17/0_128_5034_3021/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Documentary subjects Paula Jean Swearengin, Amy Vilela and Cori Bush pose with filmmaker Rachel Lears at the premiere of Knock Down the House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Documentary subjects Paula Jean Swearengin, Amy Vilela and Cori Bush pose with filmmaker Rachel Lears at the premiere of Knock Down the House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Moloshok/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was interesting to watch this at its premiere at the Sundance film festival, with a crowd of supporters, some of whom clearly knew the candidates. The audience launched into applause numerous times at great quotes, but, weirdly, I think that somewhat belittles the project. Anyone can make a propaganda video to rile up the base, especially when these four women are saying such noble things about civil rights and the betterment of the working class.

      "bodyText": "Growing up in the United States, one of the bigger selling points our elementary school teachers had for our system of government was the concept of No More Kings. Anyone could run for office and win! As I got older, I saw how this wasn\u2019t really the case. To win an election you need to be part of the establishment. Maybe this isn\u2019t quite the meritocracy I was sold? (Also, slaveholders wanting to be free: what\u2019s up with that?) Recent elections have upended the system. Donald John Trump, mouth-breathing narcissistic xenophobe he may be, does (and I really hate admitting this) somewhat live up to the \u201canyone can do it!\u201d promise I was taught as a child. A complete novice from outside the political class bankrolled (and steamrolled) himself into the White House. He\u2019s a disaster, but his victory is undeniably remarkable. But the pendulum swings back, and two years later a young bartender from the Bronx pulled her own upset, using nothing but wit, will, knowledge, perseverance and confidence, and did it with practically no money. The victory of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over the entrenched political \u201cboss\u201d Joe Crowley isn\u2019t quite winning the presidency, but Rachel Lears\u2019 documentary Knock Down The House rolls up its sleeves to show just how extraordinary her campaign was. Lears follows AOC and three other insurgent, nothing-to-lose female candidates \u201cprimary\u201d-ing longtime incumbents from the left. They include Cori Bush, an African American woman in the Missouri district where unarmed teen Michael Brown was killed by police officers in 2014, Paula Jean Swearengin, a West Virginia woman whose community has been upended by fracking, and Amy Vilela, a no-nonsense Las Vegas woman who went from being a single mother on food stamps to having a C-suite position whose core issue is healthcare. (Her daughter passed away after being refused treatment for not having the right insurance.) All four were \u201cselected\u201d (though it\u2019s a little fuzzy how) by the groups Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress as part of a push for diversity in political representation. The bulk of this spry, under-90-minutes film is on AOC. How could it not? She\u2019s an international superstar and ratings-driver for both leftwing and rightwing cable news. While this is not Frederick Wiseman-esque pure \u201cdirect cinema\u201d there are enough sequences that lean into that fly-on-the-wall type of film-making. As such, one comes away with really knowing what makes AOC tick, proving that she really is as good as she seems on TV and social media. (Also we get to meet her boyfriend, which was a first for me; he seems quite nice.) It was interesting to watch this at its premiere at the Sundance film festival, with a crowd of supporters, some of whom clearly knew the candidates. The audience launched into applause numerous times at great quotes, but, weirdly, I think that somewhat belittles the project. Anyone can make a propaganda video to rile up the base, especially when these four women are saying such noble things about civil rights and the betterment of the working class. But Knock Down The House is far more effective when it is about the people and the process, not landing quips. There is a lot of tedium in running for a local election. Knocking on doors, being friendly when people blow you off, making calls for $50 donations, taking \u201cthree hours now\u201d to scrutinized collected signatures so they don\u2019t \u201cwaste six of your days later in court\u201d.

The report of the royal commission into the Murray Darling Basin Plan is being handed to the state governor on Tuesday but it is up to the SA government when it is released. Commissioner Bret Walker SC is understood to have adopted the recommendations of his counsel assisting that the plan breaches the Water Act because it took into account factors other than the environment\u2019s needs when it set the sustainable level of \u201ctake\u201d by irrigators. The \u201ctake\u201d level was used to set the amount of water needed to be bought back from irrigators to ensure a healthy river. That figure is 2750GL but scientists say it is too low, or at best, a bare minimum. The report will come as a third fish kill in the Darling River near Menindee on Monday left the river carpeted in dead fish. Menindee local Graeme McCrabb said it was worse than the second event on 7 January, which killed hundreds of thousands of fish. \u201cIt\u2019s about 10 kms to 15 kms upstream from the town and river is literally carpeted from one side to the other with thousands of bony bream,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re still dying, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen the end of it yet,\u201d he said.

He cited suggestions the development of the plan to safeguard the river system took into account a \u201ctriple bottom line\u201d approach of environmental, social and economic factors. \u201cThis does not accord with my recollection,\u201d Burke said. \u201cMy recollection of the advice that I received and the approach taken, was that the sustainable level of take had to be determined based on the requirements of the health of the basin. \u201cHow that was then delivered could be optimised, in line with the Water Act and the international agreements that underpin it, taking into account environmental, economic and social concerns.\u201d Walker responded the next day: \u201cThe submission made to me by counsel was that what you fairly call \u2018economic and social concerns\u2019 did affect the ultimate determination of environmental parameters \u2013 although in a manner still not disclosed by the [Murray-Darling Basin Authority],\u201d he wrote. In his closing submission to the inquiry, counsel assisting the royal commission Richard Beasley SC said taking into account social and economic factors when setting environmental flows had \u201cmisinterpreted the Water Act \u2026 in a crucial way\u201d in setting the environmentally sustainable level of take. Walker said assuming Burke\u2019s recollection was correct, \u201cdocuments before the commissions showed the advice you were given is not consistent with the contemporaneous records and reports tendered at the commission hearing\u201d. If Walker is correct \u2013 he is one of the most eminent lawyers in Australia \u2013 then the entire $13bn plan to restore the river is likely invalid, though it may take a legal challenge to overturn it. It also raises serious questions about whether the goals of the plan to reclaim water are adequate. More recently the targets for water recovery for the environment have been cut further: 70GL has been cut from the northern basin target of 390GL, and 605Gl from the southern basin, with plans to recover that water through a series of projects. One of those projects is the Menindee Lakes project, which is coming under intense scrutiny in the wake of fish kills. The SA royal commission was hampered in collecting evidence from federal bureaucrats and minister after the commonwealth directed its staff not to appear. Burke, now opposition minister, did not appear before the commission. But many top scientists appeared and almost all gave evidence that the environmental targets in the plan were not adequate to ensure a healthy river. The plan has been further compromised by poor administration and enforcement.",

Even William Hague, who believes there was a public appetite for some kind of in/out showdown that made it all but inevitable (\u201cEither we had to lead that or be the victims of it\u201d), can\u2019t seem to avoid talking about it primarily as a party issue. Nick Clegg speaks of Cameron \u201cmixing apples and pears\u201d, attempting to use the Eurozone crisis as leverage for unrelated negotiations for Britain. Sarkozy, Juncker and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande make the same point \u2013 that Britain thought it could be an exception, and that any concessions given by Europe would never be enough. It wanted to be part of the club and excused from its rules. Clearly, under Cameron\u2019s government, under the pressures he gave in to, the situation was untenable.</p> <p>I wish Cameron had been interviewed. The producer, Norma Percy, said he was asked, but he \u201chas an exclusive deal with his publisher that he speaks first with his memoirs, and in order not to interfere with Theresa\u2019s deals, he put off the memoir from last October to next October\u201d. But even without him, this is a robust, detailed and very timely reminder of what led to this state of disunity. I did not come away from Inside Europe feeling particularly hopeful, but certainly better informed. This is the first of three parts, with the other two looking at the financial turmoil in Greece and the migrant crisis of 2015.</p>",

Even William Hague, who believes there was a public appetite for some kind of in/out showdown that made it all but inevitable (\u201cEither we had to lead that or be the victims of it\u201d), can\u2019t seem to avoid talking about it primarily as a party issue. Nick Clegg speaks of Cameron \u201cmixing apples and pears\u201d, attempting to use the Eurozone crisis as leverage for unrelated negotiations for Britain. Sarkozy, Juncker and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande make the same point \u2013 that Britain thought it could be an exception, and that any concessions given by Europe would never be enough. It wanted to be part of the club and excused from its rules. Clearly, under Cameron\u2019s government, under the pressures he gave in to, the situation was untenable. I wish Cameron had been interviewed. The producer, Norma Percy, said he was asked, but he \u201chas an exclusive deal with his publisher that he speaks first with his memoirs, and in order not to interfere with Theresa\u2019s deals, he put off the memoir from last October to next October\u201d. But even without him, this is a robust, detailed and very timely reminder of what led to this state of disunity. I did not come away from Inside Europe feeling particularly hopeful, but certainly better informed. This is the first of three parts, with the other two looking at the financial turmoil in Greece and the migrant crisis of 2015.",

Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The prime minister, Theresa May, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/28/brexit-latest-news-developments-theresa-may-will-commit-to-insisting-eu-replace-backstop-say-leading-tory-brexiters-politics-live?page=with:block-5c4f4722e4b024f0efeb0470#block-5c4f4722e4b024f0efeb0470\">told her MPs she wanted them to vote for an amendment</a> that would push through her deal but replace the backstop with \u201calternative arrangements\u201d.</strong> The amendment was tabled by the party chair, Graham Brady, and some have identified it as a means for parliament to indicate to the European Union what a majority of MPs could be persuaded to accept, if not the deal May and EU leaders have thrashed out. The theory goes that political leaders on the continent might then relent in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit. It was indicated on Monday evening that the Tories would whip their MPs to vote for the amendment.<br></li> <li><strong>It was unclear, however, whether that would be enough to force it through, with a significant number of May\u2019s own MPs indicating they were unlikely to follow those instructions.</strong> The hard Brexit-supporting ERG said it would not support the amendment and reiterated that opposition, even after it emerged the party would go so far as to whip MPs.<br></li> <li><strong>The EU was not following the Brady script, with one of the most senior officials working on the Brexit deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/28/brexit-latest-news-developments-theresa-may-will-commit-to-insisting-eu-replace-backstop-say-leading-tory-brexiters-politics-live?page=with:block-5c4f1414e4b0a585f6e88051#block-5c4f1414e4b0a585f6e88051\">saying the negotiations with the UK could not be reopened</a>.</strong> Sabine Weyand, the EU\u2019s deputy chief Brexit negotiator, said there was a \u201cvery high risk of a crash out not by design, but by accident\u201d.<br></li> <li><strong>Labour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/28/brexit-latest-news-developments-theresa-may-will-commit-to-insisting-eu-replace-backstop-say-leading-tory-brexiters-politics-live?page=with:block-5c4f5456e4b0a585f6e883dd#block-5c4f5456e4b0a585f6e883dd\">performed a late U-turn</a> after coming in for serious criticism over its initial intention to instruct its MPs to abstain on the immigration bill.</strong> The party released a statement saying it opposed the bill but wanted to amend it at the next stage of its passage through Parliament, rather than actively oppose it now. Later, it said it would issue a single-line whip, indicating to MPs who do vote that they should vote against \u2013 while not actually requiring them to vote.<br></li> <li><strong>The former head of MI5 Lady Manningham-Buller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/28/brexit-latest-news-developments-theresa-may-will-commit-to-insisting-eu-replace-backstop-say-leading-tory-brexiters-politics-live?page=with:block-5c4f1cb8e4b0a585f6e880a0#block-5c4f1cb8e4b0a585f6e880a0\">said the UK would be \u201cless safe\u201d if it left the EU without a deal</a>.</strong> She said that she was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the loss of access to things such as the Europol database and that there were a whole range of security issues which were \u201cdealt with better in a European context than not\u201d.<br></li> </ul> <p>For those wanting to read yet more, my colleagues <strong>Jessica Elgot</strong> and <strong>Heather Stewart</strong> have the full story on the Tories\u2019 manoeuvring today:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/28/brexiter-mps-back-away-from-anti-backstop-brexit-amendment\">Theresa May splits Tories over anti-backstop Brexit deal</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-28T22:01:45.697Z\">at 10.01pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c4f56cee4b024f0efeb050b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-28T19:29:27.823Z\">7.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s perhaps worth noting that Labour appears to have issued a single-line whip, meaning it\u2019s indicating its general position on the issue but does not necessarily expect its MPs to turn up and vote \u2013 in this case, against the bill.</p> <p>The SNP\u2019s <strong>Stewart McDonald</strong> is unimpressed by the manoeuvre:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/StewartMcDonald/status/1089966207669858304\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Labour have gone from abstaining on the Immigration Bill to a one-line whip to vote against, which means their MPs should vote against it if they can be bothered staying for the vote at 10pm.

Asked about EU objections to a renegotiation, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we have consistently heard from European leaders is that they want the United Kingdom to leave with a deal. There\u2019s a recognition that the United Kingdom leaving with a deal is in their best interests, as well as those of the UK. The deal which has been agreed was defeated by parliament. Therefore, if we are going to leave with a deal, clearly we are going to need to make some changes in order to win parliamentary support.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>The spokesman said that May wanted to hold another vote in the Commons to agree a revised Brexit deal \u201cas soon as possible\u201d.</strong> This is what Number 10 refer to as \u201cthe second meaningful vote\u201d. But the spokesman would not give any further guidance as to when this might be. He said the talks with MPs intended to find out what might be acceptable to parliament were still going on - today May has meetings with Tory MPs and MEPs - but he would not say when this process was due to end.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The spokesman implied that MPs worried about a no-deal Brexit did not have to vote tomorrow night to try to stop this. </strong>Referring to the \u201csecond meaningful vote\u201d, he said the motion would be amendable - meaning that MPs might have another chance to vote on a no-deal amendment at a later stage.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The spokesman refused to commit the government to complying with all the amendments that might be passed tomorrow</strong>. Asked if the government would respect the wishes of parliament whatever was decided tomorrow, the spokesman would not answer directly, saying at this stage it was not clear what amendments would be put to a vote, but he went on to say that \u201cas a statement of fact\u201d some of the amendments were not legally binding. In fact, most of them are not legally binding. The only ones with practical force (as opposed to political force) are those that would change the rules of the Commons, and one of those, the Yvette Cooper one, is intended to make time for a bill that would impose a specific legal requirement on the prime minister (to seek an extension of article 50 if there is no Brexit deal by 26 February).</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>May will close the Brexit debate tomorrow night, Number 10 said. </strong>That means she will speak in the final half hour before the vote at 7pm.

It is small wonder that all this has produced both chaos and paralysis in government and parliament ...</p> <p>Our ability as a party to get through this crisis will determine our future fortunes. As a Conservative MP it is my duty to listen to colleagues and to try and find a way through. But we will not find one unless we remember that, historically, the secret of our success as a party has been our ability to provide hope, confidence and leadership for a much wider group of electoral supporters than our membership. Streams of emails may only be the roughest of guides, but I am struck by the numbers who write to me who once gave us their support and now do not. Unless we reassure them of our ability to deliver the quiet stable government they desire, our relevance to promoting the wellbeing of our country must be in question.</p> </blockquote> <p>I\u2019m just off to the lobby briefing.

He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If we mean it, if we really try, I have no doubt that the EU will give us the freedom clause we need. So now is the time to stiffen the sinews and summon up the blood and get on that trusty BAE 146 and go back to Brussels and get it.</p> <p>And if the PM secures that change \u2013 a proper UK-sized perforation in the fabric of the backstop itself - I have no doubt that she will have the whole country full-throatedly behind her.</p> </blockquote> <p>But, when he resigned from cabinet last summer, in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44772804\">his resignation letter </a>Johnson did not even mention the backstop. Instead, he condemned the whole thrust of May\u2019s plan for a future UK-EU trade deal. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The British government has spent decades arguing against this or that EU directive, on the grounds that it was too burdensome or ill-thought out. We are now in the ludicrous position of asserting that we must accept huge amounts of precisely such EU law, without changing an iota, because it is essential for our economic health - and when we no longer have any ability to in\ufb02uence these laws as they are made.</p> <p>In that respect we are truly headed for the status of colony - and many will struggle to see the economic or political advantages of that particular arrangement.</p> </blockquote> <p>To be fair, at that point there was no withdrawal agreement; Johnson was attacking the Chequers plan, which in some respects has been superseded by the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. But, after the withdrawal agreement, Johnson continued to condemn it severely, and not just for its backstop plan. This is what he said <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/01/13/must-brave-vote-deal-represents-worst-worlds/\">in a Telegraph column (paywall)</a> shortly before the vote on the plan earlier this month.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This deal would still make it impossible to do big free-trade deals \u2013 as the US ambassador has correctly pointed out. It would prevent us from engaging in the kind of regulatory divergence \u2013 control of our own laws \u2013 that people voted for.</p> <p>And since not a dot or a comma of this deal has changed in the past month, it still means that we are set to hand over \u00a339bn for nothing, and with no guarantees about our future relationship.</p> <p>This deal is still the worst of both worlds, by which we somehow leave the EU but end up being run by the EU. It is still a complete stinker, and so no \u2013 I can\u2019t tell exactly what will happen on Tuesday. But I cannot believe that it has much of a chance of getting past the House of Commons.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6e531c0b0e8108e4825cc1b3340c38c94c70187\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6e531c0b0e8108e4825cc1b3340c38c94c70187/0_101_4134_2480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c4ecfa1e4b0a585f6e87dba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-28T09:59:54.762Z\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It is worth pointing out that<strong> Sir Graham Brady</strong> and <strong>Boris Johnson,</strong> although both Brexiters and both demanding a replacement to the backstop, have set slightly different red lines.</p> <p>On the BBC\u2019s Westminster Hour last night Brady said that the demand set out in his amendment (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/28/brexit-latest-news-developments-theresa-may-will-commit-to-insisting-eu-replace-backstop-say-leading-tory-brexiters-politics-live?page=with:block-5c4ebfcce4b024f0efeafe97#block-5c4ebfcce4b024f0efeafe97\"> 9.22am)</a> would not necessarily require the withdrawal agreement to be rewritten.

You could do it through a legally binding codicil to the withdrawal agreement ...</p> <p>I think the crucial thing is a legally binding change that makes it clear that the United Kingdom can never be trapped in the backstop in perpetuity.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Johnson implies that a codicil, or some other form of legally-binding addendum to the withdrawal agreement, would not be enough. He says the withdrawal agreement would have to be re-opened, to allow the insertion of what he calls his \u201cfreedom clause\u201d. (See<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/01/27/pm-ready-fight-back-against-brussels-deal-could-yet-fixed/\"> 9.22am.) </a>In <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/01/27/pm-ready-fight-back-against-brussels-deal-could-yet-fixed/\">his Telegraph column (paywall)</a> he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If she can put in that freedom clause or clauses \u2013 and be in no doubt, this means reopening the text of the Treaty itself \u2013 then we have defused the booby-trap.

There is a guide to what is coming up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/27/what-is-the-next-commons-brexit-debate-about\">here</a>, and there is particularly interest in what is being referred to as the<strong> Graham Brady</strong> amendment, which says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At end, add \u201cand requires the Northern Ireland backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border; supports leaving the European Union with a deal and would therefore support the withdrawal agreement subject to this change.\u201d.</p> </blockquote> <p>(Technically it should be known as the Andrew Murrison amendment, because Murrison is the MP who tabled it, but he is primarily associated with another one. For the sake of simplicity, we\u2019ll keep calling it Brady\u2019s.)</p> <p>Downing Street has not said yet how it will instruct government MPs to vote on this amendment. If Theresa May were to formally endorse it, that would amount to the government saying it now wants to replace the backstop that it signed up to only at the end of last year. But May has admitted that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/21/brexit-latest-news-mays-statement-mps-commons-deal-will-be-absolute-disaster-says-business-minister-as-may-prepares-to-address-mps-politics-live?page=with:block-5c45edf4e4b058cfe6d94553#block-5c45edf4e4b058cfe6d94553\">there will have to be changes to the backstop for the deal to pass parliament, </a>and if the Brady amendment were pass with a majority, she would be able to go back to Brussels and explain that this was the change necessary to get the withdrawal agreement through parliament.</p> <p>This morning Brady, who as chair of the Conservative 1922 committee serves as the shop steward for Tory backbenchers, said he thought the government would support his amendment. Asked if it has government backing, Brady, who voted leave in the referendum, told the Today programme:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I hope so ... I don\u2019t know so. The amendment was born out of a number of conversations I had with colleagues including members of the government, including the prime minister. </p> <p>I had also spoken to people in the DUP too and I\u2019m hoping that the way in which the amendment is crafted can attract that very broad support and if we can win the vote on my amendment then I think it gives the prime minister enormous firepower.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this morning <strong>Boris Johnson</strong>, the Brexiter former foreign secretary, has used <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/01/27/pm-ready-fight-back-against-brussels-deal-could-yet-fixed/\">his Telegraph column (paywall) </a>to say that May is also now committed to getting rid of the backstop. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have heard it from the lips of very senior sources in government \u2013 speaking with the authority, it is claimed, of the prime minister herself \u2013 that this country is about to seek proper binding legal change to the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/theresa-mays-draft-brexit-withdrawal-agreement-read-full/\">current lamentable withdrawal agreement.</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/brexit-backstop-irish-border-important-deal/\">The PM wants to get rid of the backstop</a>; that is, she wants to change the text so as to insert either a sunset clause or a mechanism for the UK to escape without reference to the EU. She is going to fight for a freedom clause \u2013 right there in article 185 of the protocol or thereabouts \u2013 that would finally give us the keys to our own future. If she can change the backstop, then yes, we would be able to do free trade deals, and yes, we would be able to vary our regulation, and yes, the whole of the UK would be able to leave the EU \u2013 proud and intact \u2013 without leaving Northern Ireland a perpetual hostage.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> <p><em>11am: </em>Downing Street lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>4pm: </em>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, gives evidence to the Commons health committee.</p> <p><em>4pm:</em> Sir Mark Sedwill, the national security adviser and cabinet secretary, gives evidence to the joint national security committee.</p> <p>As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit.

Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: The prime minister, Theresa May, told her MPs she wanted them to vote for an amendment that would push through her deal but replace the backstop with \u201calternative arrangements\u201d. The amendment was tabled by the party chair, Graham Brady, and some have identified it as a means for parliament to indicate to the European Union what a majority of MPs could be persuaded to accept, if not the deal May and EU leaders have thrashed out. The theory goes that political leaders on the continent might then relent in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit. It was indicated on Monday evening that the Tories would whip their MPs to vote for the amendment. It was unclear, however, whether that would be enough to force it through, with a significant number of May\u2019s own MPs indicating they were unlikely to follow those instructions. The hard Brexit-supporting ERG said it would not support the amendment and reiterated that opposition, even after it emerged the party would go so far as to whip MPs. The EU was not following the Brady script, with one of the most senior officials working on the Brexit deal saying the negotiations with the UK could not be reopened. Sabine Weyand, the EU\u2019s deputy chief Brexit negotiator, said there was a \u201cvery high risk of a crash out not by design, but by accident\u201d. Labour performed a late U-turn after coming in for serious criticism over its initial intention to instruct its MPs to abstain on the immigration bill. The party released a statement saying it opposed the bill but wanted to amend it at the next stage of its passage through Parliament, rather than actively oppose it now. Later, it said it would issue a single-line whip, indicating to MPs who do vote that they should vote against \u2013 while not actually requiring them to vote. The former head of MI5 Lady Manningham-Buller said the UK would be \u201cless safe\u201d if it left the EU without a deal. She said that she was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the loss of access to things such as the Europol database and that there were a whole range of security issues which were \u201cdealt with better in a European context than not\u201d. For those wanting to read yet more, my colleagues Jessica Elgot and Heather Stewart have the full story on the Tories\u2019 manoeuvring today: It\u2019s perhaps worth noting that Labour appears to have issued a single-line whip, meaning it\u2019s indicating its general position on the issue but does not necessarily expect its MPs to turn up and vote \u2013 in this case, against the bill. The SNP\u2019s Stewart McDonald is unimpressed by the manoeuvre: Some Labour MPs, however, are indicating they plan to vote against \u2013 in some cases, regardless of what the party\u2019s official position was: It seems Labour MPs will now be asked to vote against the immigration bill tonight. The party had previously said it did not support the bill\u2019s aims, but would ask MPs to abstain (see 4.42pm). HuffPost UK\u2019s Paul Waugh has a little more detail on the possible timing of the vote: This afternoon, the health secrerary Matt Hancock told a Parliamentary committee that \u201cmedicines will be prioritised [over food] in the event of a no-deal Brexit\u201d. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, has said: The fact that the health secretary is forced to make decisions over whether to prioritise medicine over food in the event of a Tory no-deal Brexit is simply astonishing. And it\u2019s all the more irresponsible that Theresa May stubbornly refuses to rule out no deal. Playing Russian roulette with the national interest and putting peoples\u2019 health at risk like this is shameful and scandalous. Earlier, it was reported that two MPs were planning to withdraw their amendments, making it more likely the Speaker, John Bercow, would call the Brady one. That\u2019s now been confirmed. John Baron, who tabled another of the amendments, has said: I urge fellow Conservatives to support [the Brady amendment]. This stands the best chance of uniting the party, getting the DUP on board, and sending a clear message to the EU that the backstop is the key problem \u2013 without a majority tomorrow, the EU could conclude the backstop is not important. The BBC\u2019s Iain Watson has some more on the government\u2019s thinking. As previously noted, the level of government support for the amendment may go some way to determining the actions of opposition parties. It may not be a government amendment but, with Theresa May choosing to whip the vote, will opposition MPs see a practical difference? Some more detail from Brandon Lewis, who has said: It (the Brady amendment) allows the prime minister to give a very clear message around what Parliament wants, where the party is. And actually that is quite a strong position to be in. I would hope the ERG, when they look at this and actually look through the detail of what this gives the PM tomorrow, in terms of a meaningful vote that will come back later, [see)] it is about giving a message to Europe about what can go through Parliament in terms of dealing with the backstop issue and why that matters. Graham Brady said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d the government would whip in support of his amendment as he left the meeting this evening. There are also now reports suggesting the new vote will be held within three weeks, leaving only sightly more than six weeks between it and Brexit itself on 29 March: It appears we now have confirmation that Tory MPs will be whipped to vote for the Brady amendment. There had been some confusion over exactly how far she would go in supporting it. The questions now are: Firstly, how many of her hard Brexit-supporting MPs can she take with her? The rightwing ERG has already said it will not back Brady and, according to the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford, has restated that position in light of the news it will be a whipped vote. Secondly, how will the other parties react now the amendment has government support? Here is more on the PM\u2019s meeting with Tory MPs. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn From BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham From CityAM\u2019s Owen Bennett That\u2019s all from me. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. More from the PM\u2019s meeting with Tory MPs. From the Guardian\u2019s Dan Sabbagh From Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti From the BBC\u2019s Ross Hawkins From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the BBC\u2019s Vicki Young The Conservative MPs Andrew Murrison and John Baron, who have also tabled anti backstop amendments in addition to the one known as the Graham Brady amendment (which is technically an Andrew Murrison amendment too, but never mind - see 9.22am), are going to withdraw their amendments, the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope reports. Withdrawing those amendments would increase the chances of John Bercow, the speaker, calling the Brady one. Given all the attention it is receiving, you would expect Bercow to call it anyway, but Number 10 see him as unhelpful and unpredictable, and are clearly taking no chances. This, from my colleague Dan Sabbagh, sums up the problem rather well. We\u2019re getting confusing messages from the PM\u2019s meeting with Conservative MPs. This is from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. But this is from my colleague Jessica Elgot. And this is from my colleague Dan Sabbagh. Theresa May is urging Conservative MPs to back the Graham Brady amendment (see 9.22am), ITV\u2019s Robert Peston reports. Given that the European Research Group, the most powerful caucus in the parliamentary Conservative party, has come out against Brady (see 5.03pm), this seems to be what civil servants would call a \u201ccourageous\u201d move by May. She has just backed an amendment that seems likely to fail - not least because if May is backing Brady, Labour Brexiters will think twice about voting for what will be seen as a de facto government amendment. Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister, could not get into the meeting for Conservative MPs with Theresa May, Sky\u2019s Kate McCann reports. Theresa May has just arrived for her meeting with Conservative MPs in one of the committee rooms at parliament, ITV\u2019s Daniel Hewitt reports. Labour\u2019s backing for Yvette Cooper\u2019s anti no-deal Brexit amendment has been thrown into doubt, after a shadow cabinet ally of Jeremy Corbyn warned that supporting it would smack of \u201cignoring the views of millions of ordinary folk\u201d, my colleague Heather Stewart reports. Labour had been widely expected to whip its MPs to support the amendment, tabled by Cooper and former Conservative minister Nick Boles, which paves the way for a backbench bill mandating the government to seek a nine-month extension to article 50. But Jon Trickett, the shadow cabinet office minister, told the Guardian voters in his constituency would regard support for the measure on Tuesday as a failure to respect the result of the 2016 referendum. Heather\u2019s full story is here. And this is from my colleague Jessica Elgot, who has been outside the meeting where the European Research Group, which represents the more hardline Tory Brexiters, have been discussing tomorrow\u2019s votes. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford, on the prospects of the Yvette Cooper amendment passing tomorrow. Here is more on what Sabine Weyand, the EU\u2019s deputy chief Brexit negotiator, was saying at the European Policy Centre conference in Brussels this afternoon. These are from the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston says most Tory Brexiters in European Research Group will not vote for the Graham Brady amendment tomorrow. Labour has issued a statement explaining its decision to abstain at the second reading of the immigration bill tonight. (See 3.48pm and 3.54pm.) Labour does not support the intentions contained in this bill and will therefore be seeking to amend this Bill substantially at committee stage. Our immigration system must be ready post-Brexit, and for that reason we need an immigration bill. But Labour totally opposes the Tories\u2019 disgraceful hostile environment policy, their terrible treatment of EU and UK citizens, their persistent anti-migrant campaign and their shameful labelling of workers earning less than \u00a330,000 as low-skilled. Labour has set out our proposed immigration system that supports the needs of our economy and treats people fairly. We will introduce a work visa for all those we need to fill skills and labour shortages across a range of professions we need to come here \u2013 based on the needs of our economy, not a false distinction between high and low skilled workers based on their salary. Downing Street is now saying the government might table its own amendment ahead of tomorrow\u2019s debate, the Telegraph\u2019s Gordon Rayner reports. Facebook will tackle political misinformation in the run-up to the EU elections this May with a new \u201cwar room\u201d based in Dublin, the company\u2019s incoming communications chief, Nick Clegg, has announced. My colleague Alex Hearn has the full story here. And, while we\u2019re on the subject of the immigration bill (see 3.48pm), the Lib Dems have sent out an unusually pithy press release about the subject. MPs will debate the second reading of the immigration bill this afternoon (or the immigration and social security coordination [EU withdrawal] bill, to give it its full title). This is the legislation that will bring EU nationals under UK immigration law after Brexit. Labour will abstain when it comes to the vote. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister and SNP leader, has criticised the decision. LabourRichard is Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader. Anna Soubry, the Tory pro-European, says she is voting against. And the Labour MP Chris Leslie (a frequent critic of the Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s) is voting against it too. Labour has not responded to a question about why it is abstaining. But the party has accepted the case for ending freedom of movement after Brexit, while it has been highly critical of the government\u2019s specific plans for migration controls on EU nationals after Brexit, and so perhaps its position is no great surprise. Lady Manningham-Buller, the former head of MI5, told the World at One that the UK would be \u201cless safe\u201d if it left the EU without a deal. She said that she was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the loss of access to things like the Europol database and that there were a whole range of security issues which were \u201cdealt with better in a European context than not\u201d. She told the programme: If we leave without a deal we are going to be less safe ... I am pretty queasy that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is so in favour of Brexit \u2013 I think that should give us all pause. She also said that she was \u201cmore than sympathetic\u201d to the Yvette Cooper bill designed to stop the government taking the UK out of the EU without a deal. When it was put to her that it was unconstitutional (because Cooper has a plan to allow her bill to be debated without government approval), Manningham-Buller did not accept that. She went on: It seems to me there\u2019s an irony here. The Brexiters - and I\u2019m not one of them - argue that it\u2019s about taking back parliamentary sovereignty. If it\u2019s about about taking back parliamentary sovereignty, parliament is sovereign. And I think no deal, and the uncertainties of no deal ... [are] to be avoided at all costs. This is from BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham, quoting an unnamed ERG member explaining why they are sceptical about the Graham Brady amendment. This argument matches the one used by Boris Johnson in his Telegraph column this morning. See 9.59am. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP and chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tories pushing for a harder Brexit, has played down reports that the ERG is split over whether or not to back the Graham Brady amendment. This is from the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith. Sammy Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, has issued a statement urging the government to be \u201ctough\u201d in the Brexit talks and exploit what he claims is the \u201creal chaos\u201d in Brussels and Dublin. What he is saying will surprise observers who might assume that, if you are looking for a place mired in Brexit chaos, another capital might make a better candidate ... Theresa May is meeting Conservative MP this evening to discuss Brexit, the BBC\u2019s Iain Watson reports. Sabine Weyand, the EU\u2019s deputy chief Brexit negotiator, has been speaking at an event in Brussels. The Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge has posted some quotes from her opening remarks, and they are unusually blunt. Weyand says it is \u201ca big challenge\u201d to see how the UK will secure a majority for any Brexit deal. She seems to rule out the EU reopening the negotiation with the UK, saying it\u2019s over. She accuses the UK of \u201csnatching defeat from the jaws of victory\u201d, saying the backstop was a much better for the UK than people assume. She insists that the EU has already firmly rejected calls for the backstop to be time-limited. She implies some British MPs are ignorant of what is in the withdrawal agreement. She says there is a \u201cvery high risk\u201d of a no-deal Brexit. Here is the letter from supermarket bosses to MPs warning about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. For our Future\u2019s Sake (FFS), the student-led anti-Brexit campaign, has released some polling from Opinium suggesting young people are losing faith in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s handling of Brexit. \u201cIn just 6 months, 18-34-year-old\u2019s approval of how Corbyn is responding to Brexit has plummeted 27 percentage points, from +13% in July to -14% this week,\u201d it says. Kira Lewis, an FFS activist, said: Unfortunately, over the last 6 months, there\u2019s been a massive drop in young people\u2019s approval of how Jeremy Corbyn in handling Brexit. The reason for this is painfully clear - the overwhelming majority of Corbyn supporters, like myself, want Labour to back a People\u2019s Vote on the Brexit deal, but if Labour and him enable Brexit, they are at risk of losing young supporters. It is quite possible that all the Brexit amendments called tomorrow will be voted down, the Times\u2019 Henry Zeffman argues. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg thinks this is quite likely too. Here are some more clues as to what Tory Brexiters think about the Graham Brady amendment. From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar From the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes Supermarkets could run out of food and be forced to raise prices under a no-deal Brexit, the British Retail Consortium has told MPs in a letter. The BBC has further details. The Graham Brady amendment seems to be losing Brexiter supporter. A prominent Tory Brexiter called me earlier (about something else) and complained that the Brady amendment was \u201ctoo vague\u201d. Other colleagues are picking up the same reservations. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford. This is from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. And this is from the Guardian\u2019s Jessica Elgot. Here are the main points from the Number 10 lobby briefing. Downing Street said explicitly that the Brexit withdrawal deal would have to change. (See 12.31pm.) The prime minister\u2019s spokesman suggested that, despite EU claims that the withdrawal agreement could not be renegotiated (repeated this morning - see 12.31pm), the EU would have to compromise. Asked about EU objections to a renegotiation, he said: What we have consistently heard from European leaders is that they want the United Kingdom to leave with a deal. There\u2019s a recognition that the United Kingdom leaving with a deal is in their best interests, as well as those of the UK. The deal which has been agreed was defeated by parliament. Therefore, if we are going to leave with a deal, clearly we are going to need to make some changes in order to win parliamentary support. The spokesman said that May wanted to hold another vote in the Commons to agree a revised Brexit deal \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. This is what Number 10 refer to as \u201cthe second meaningful vote\u201d. But the spokesman would not give any further guidance as to when this might be. He said the talks with MPs intended to find out what might be acceptable to parliament were still going on - today May has meetings with Tory MPs and MEPs - but he would not say when this process was due to end. The spokesman implied that MPs worried about a no-deal Brexit did not have to vote tomorrow night to try to stop this. Referring to the \u201csecond meaningful vote\u201d, he said the motion would be amendable - meaning that MPs might have another chance to vote on a no-deal amendment at a later stage. The spokesman refused to commit the government to complying with all the amendments that might be passed tomorrow. Asked if the government would respect the wishes of parliament whatever was decided tomorrow, the spokesman would not answer directly, saying at this stage it was not clear what amendments would be put to a vote, but he went on to say that \u201cas a statement of fact\u201d some of the amendments were not legally binding. In fact, most of them are not legally binding. The only ones with practical force (as opposed to political force) are those that would change the rules of the Commons, and one of those, the Yvette Cooper one, is intended to make time for a bill that would impose a specific legal requirement on the prime minister (to seek an extension of article 50 if there is no Brexit deal by 26 February). May will close the Brexit debate tomorrow night, Number 10 said. That means she will speak in the final half hour before the vote at 7pm. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, will open the debate. The spokesman urged John Bercow, the speaker, to select a wide variety of amendments tomorrow. Amendments are only put to a vote if they are selected. The spokesman said the choice of amendments was entirely a matter for Bercow. But he added: I\u2019m sure he will want to make sure that a wide range of views from across the House are considered. The spokesman would not say whether government MPs will be asked to back the Graham Brady amendment, saying it was too soon to comment because the speaker has not decided yet which amendments he will call. That decision will only be taken at a speaker\u2019s meeting tomorrow morning. The spokesman dismissed a Guardian story saying that Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, told May in a phone call that she would have to keep the UK in a permanent customs union with the EU if she wants to renegotiate the backstop. The spokesman said the story \u201csimply does not reflect the reality\u201d of the call. The spokesman distanced May from the anti-German language that the Tory MP Mark Francois used last week to describe Tom Enders, the German Airbus boss who issued a warning about a no-deal Brexit. Asked about what Francois said, the spokesman said: They are not things that I would expect [May] to say. But the spokesman refused an invitation to say whether May was worried about the impact comments like this might have on Germans considering doing business with the UK. The European commission hold a daily press briefing which takes place at the same time as Downing Street\u2019s. And, just as Number 10 was saying that the withdrawal deal would have to change (although not necessarily the text of the withdrawal agreement - see 11.57am), Brussels said it was the withdrawal agreement would not be reopened. Margaritis Schinas, the commission\u2019s spokesman, told journalists: We have a unanimous EU27 position on the withdrawal agreement which reflects the common EU position. This withdrawal agreement has been agreed with the UK government, it is endorsed by leaders and is not open for renegotiation. Asked if that position would change if MPs vote to demand changes to the Irish backstop, Schinas said: The only thing I have to say is that we shall wait for the result of the vote of the Commons tomorrow. Then we will wait for the government to tell us what are the next steps. That\u2019s how it\u2019s going to work. Brussels\u2019 senior officials will consider the latest \u201cBrexit preparedness and contingency\u201d measures at this week\u2019s college of commissioners meeting on Wednesday. I\u2019m just back from the lobby briefing, and Number 10 is now explicitly saying that the EU will have to agree to changes to the Brexit deal. This is not much more than a statement of the obvious, and it was implicit in what Theresa May said in her Commons statement last week following the defeat of her deal, but on that occasion May was careful to avoid anything that sounded like an ultimatum to the EU. Now Number 10 is saying directly that the deal will have to be changed. Number 10 has said the withdrawal deal will have to change. In a message that makes an attempt to renegotiate the deal with the EU, at least to some extent, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman told journalists: We reached an agreement with the European Union in relation to the withdrawal agreement and the future partnership. That was put to a vote of MPs, and MPs rejected that deal, including the withdrawal agreement, by 230 votes. The prime minister is absolutely committed to leaving the EU with a deal, but clearly if we are to obtain parliamentary support for that deal, some changes will have to be made. But the spokesman would not be drawn on whether \u201csome changes\u201d meant the text of the withdrawal agreement itself would have to change (as Boris Johnson is demanding - see 9.59am), or whether some form of addendum (like Graham Brady\u2019s codicil - see 9.59am) might do the trick. I will post more from the briefing shortly. My colleague Matthew d\u2019Ancona has a good column today explaining why, as someone with centre-right politics, he can now no longer identify with the Conservative party. It is \u201cmorphing into something I find alien and repellent\u201d, he says. In an article for Prospect, the Conservative pro-European Dominic Grieve makes a similarish argument, in slightly more diplomatic terms. Here\u2019s an excerpt. So it is impossible to look at what we have done over Brexit without astonishment. In the three years since David Cameron started the 2016 referendum process, we have taken our country on a path of revolutionary upheaval ... It is small wonder that all this has produced both chaos and paralysis in government and parliament ... Our ability as a party to get through this crisis will determine our future fortunes. As a Conservative MP it is my duty to listen to colleagues and to try and find a way through. But we will not find one unless we remember that, historically, the secret of our success as a party has been our ability to provide hope, confidence and leadership for a much wider group of electoral supporters than our membership. Streams of emails may only be the roughest of guides, but I am struck by the numbers who write to me who once gave us their support and now do not. Unless we reassure them of our ability to deliver the quiet stable government they desire, our relevance to promoting the wellbeing of our country must be in question. I\u2019m just off to the lobby briefing. I will post again after 11.30am. It is also worth noting that, in his Telegraph column today (paywall), Boris Johnson strikes a rather different tone on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal from the one he adopted when he resigned last summer. Today he implies that, provided May is able to get rid of the backstop, he will enthusiastically back her plan. He says: If we mean it, if we really try, I have no doubt that the EU will give us the freedom clause we need. So now is the time to stiffen the sinews and summon up the blood and get on that trusty BAE 146 and go back to Brussels and get it. And if the PM secures that change \u2013 a proper UK-sized perforation in the fabric of the backstop itself - I have no doubt that she will have the whole country full-throatedly behind her. But, when he resigned from cabinet last summer, in his resignation letter Johnson did not even mention the backstop. Instead, he condemned the whole thrust of May\u2019s plan for a future UK-EU trade deal. He said: The British government has spent decades arguing against this or that EU directive, on the grounds that it was too burdensome or ill-thought out. We are now in the ludicrous position of asserting that we must accept huge amounts of precisely such EU law, without changing an iota, because it is essential for our economic health - and when we no longer have any ability to in\ufb02uence these laws as they are made. In that respect we are truly headed for the status of colony - and many will struggle to see the economic or political advantages of that particular arrangement. To be fair, at that point there was no withdrawal agreement; Johnson was attacking the Chequers plan, which in some respects has been superseded by the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. But, after the withdrawal agreement, Johnson continued to condemn it severely, and not just for its backstop plan. This is what he said in a Telegraph column (paywall) shortly before the vote on the plan earlier this month. This deal would still make it impossible to do big free-trade deals \u2013 as the US ambassador has correctly pointed out. It would prevent us from engaging in the kind of regulatory divergence \u2013 control of our own laws \u2013 that people voted for. And since not a dot or a comma of this deal has changed in the past month, it still means that we are set to hand over \u00a339bn for nothing, and with no guarantees about our future relationship. This deal is still the worst of both worlds, by which we somehow leave the EU but end up being run by the EU. It is still a complete stinker, and so no \u2013 I can\u2019t tell exactly what will happen on Tuesday. But I cannot believe that it has much of a chance of getting past the House of Commons. It is worth pointing out that Sir Graham Brady and Boris Johnson, although both Brexiters and both demanding a replacement to the backstop, have set slightly different red lines. On the BBC\u2019s Westminster Hour last night Brady said that the demand set out in his amendment (see 9.22am) would not necessarily require the withdrawal agreement to be rewritten. He explained: You wouldn\u2019t have to open up the withdrawal agreement. You could do it through a legally binding codicil to the withdrawal agreement ... I think the crucial thing is a legally binding change that makes it clear that the United Kingdom can never be trapped in the backstop in perpetuity. But Johnson implies that a codicil, or some other form of legally-binding addendum to the withdrawal agreement, would not be enough. He says the withdrawal agreement would have to be re-opened, to allow the insertion of what he calls his \u201cfreedom clause\u201d. (See 9.22am.) In his Telegraph column (paywall) he says: If she can put in that freedom clause or clauses \u2013 and be in no doubt, this means reopening the text of the Treaty itself \u2013 then we have defused the booby-trap. We have opened a hole at the bottom of the lobster pot. We will have a way out, and we will be able to negotiate the next phase \u2013 the future partnership \u2013 without having our hands fettered by the EU, and do the Canada-style free trade deal that will maximise the long term opportunities of Brexit. For the record, this is what Theresa May said in her statement to the Commons last Monday about her plans to get further assurances on the backstop. With regard to the backstop, despite the changes we have previously agreed, there remain two core issues: the fear that we could be trapped in it permanently; and concerns over its potential impact on our Union if Northern Ireland is treated differently from the rest of the UK. So I will be talking further this week to colleagues - including in the DUP \u2013 to consider how we might meet our obligations to the people of Northern Ireland and Ireland in a way that can command the greatest possible support in the House. And I will then take the conclusions of those discussion back to the EU. Tomorrow there will be a debate in the Commons that may start to give the UK a Brexit policy - something that has been conspicuously absent since Theresa May\u2019s plan was rejected by MPs earlier this month in the most crushing government defeat in UK politics in the democratic era. There is a guide to what is coming up here, and there is particularly interest in what is being referred to as the Graham Brady amendment, which says: At end, add \u201cand requires the Northern Ireland backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border; supports leaving the European Union with a deal and would therefore support the withdrawal agreement subject to this change.\u201d. (Technically it should be known as the Andrew Murrison amendment, because Murrison is the MP who tabled it, but he is primarily associated with another one. For the sake of simplicity, we\u2019ll keep calling it Brady\u2019s.) Downing Street has not said yet how it will instruct government MPs to vote on this amendment. If Theresa May were to formally endorse it, that would amount to the government saying it now wants to replace the backstop that it signed up to only at the end of last year. But May has admitted that there will have to be changes to the backstop for the deal to pass parliament, and if the Brady amendment were pass with a majority, she would be able to go back to Brussels and explain that this was the change necessary to get the withdrawal agreement through parliament. This morning Brady, who as chair of the Conservative 1922 committee serves as the shop steward for Tory backbenchers, said he thought the government would support his amendment. Asked if it has government backing, Brady, who voted leave in the referendum, told the Today programme: I hope so ... I don\u2019t know so. The amendment was born out of a number of conversations I had with colleagues including members of the government, including the prime minister. I had also spoken to people in the DUP too and I\u2019m hoping that the way in which the amendment is crafted can attract that very broad support and if we can win the vote on my amendment then I think it gives the prime minister enormous firepower. And this morning Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary, has used his Telegraph column (paywall) to say that May is also now committed to getting rid of the backstop. He said: I have heard it from the lips of very senior sources in government \u2013 speaking with the authority, it is claimed, of the prime minister herself \u2013 that this country is about to seek proper binding legal change to the current lamentable withdrawal agreement. The PM wants to get rid of the backstop; that is, she wants to change the text so as to insert either a sunset clause or a mechanism for the UK to escape without reference to the EU. She is going to fight for a freedom clause \u2013 right there in article 185 of the protocol or thereabouts \u2013 that would finally give us the keys to our own future. If she can change the backstop, then yes, we would be able to do free trade deals, and yes, we would be able to vary our regulation, and yes, the whole of the UK would be able to leave the EU \u2013 proud and intact \u2013 without leaving Northern Ireland a perpetual hostage. Here is the agenda for the day. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 4pm: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, gives evidence to the Commons health committee. 4pm: Sir Mark Sedwill, the national security adviser and cabinet secretary, gives evidence to the joint national security committee. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I finish, at around 6pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Activists campaigning for the release of the Bahraini refugee footballer Hakeem al-Araibi, who has been detained in Thailand since November after an Interpol red notice was wrongly issued against him, say his plight has become an emergency. The warnings came from Brendan Schwab of the World Players Association and the former Australia captain Craig Foster after news that Bahrain has formally submitted an extradition request for Al-Araibi\u2019s return. Schwab and Foster were in Zurich on Monday to urge Fifa to do more to save Al-Araibi, who fled Bahrain after being beaten by police and was given refugee status by Australia, over fears he will be tortured or even killed if he is sent back. \u201cThe situation is very urgent because, even if Bahrain does not succeed in extraditing Hakeem, the consequences for him of spending months or even years in the prison while his case drags will be destroying for him,\u201d Schwab told the Guardian. \u201cWe are clearly facing a human rights emergency which needs to be elevated to the highest levels in Bahrain and Thailand.

In 2016 Al-Araibi was given a 10-year prison sentence in absentia after being convicted of vandalising a police station, even though he was playing in a televised match at the time the crime took place. \u201cAfter meeting Fifa we believe it understands the gravity of the case,\u201d Schwab said. \u201cThe urgent challenge now for football is to come up with a way to solve it.\u201d On Monday Bahrain\u2019s interior minister defended his government\u2019s pursuit of al-Araibi, claiming concerns he will face torture and unjust imprisonment if he is returned are \u201cfalse reports\u201d. The minister, General Shaikh Rashid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa, said the rule of law prevailed in Bahrain, pointing to al-Araibi\u2019s release on bail from the initial charges \u2013 which allowed him to flee and claim refuge in Australia. \u201cThe external interference in the internal affairs of Bahrain is unacceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cThose raising unfounded doubts about the integrity and independence of the Kingdom\u2019s judicial system are not only interfering, but also attempting to influence the course of justice.\u201d He said there was a need to \u201crespect the legal proceedings and not to ignore the facts by spreading false reports and biased and non-objective information\u201d. The Bahraini government\u2019s communications office did not answer specific questions about its attempts to have al-Araibi returned, including how it obtained an Interpol red notice in contravention of Interpol policies designed to protect refugees. Previous statements from the Bahraini government defending its justice system have been labeled \u201cabsurd\u201d by human rights groups, noting multiple investigations and reports on the torture and mistreatment of prisoners and targeting of opposition figures. Yahya Alhadid, president of Gulf Institute for Democracy and Human Rights, pointed to the recent death sentences delivered by the Bahraini court against political detainees and life sentences against opposition leaders. \u201cThis is a serious indicator of what is waiting for Hakeem if extradited back to Bahrain,\u201d he said. \u201cThe judge, Mohammad Bin Ali al-Khalifa, who sentenced al-Araibi had upheld the court of cassation\u2019s sentence against the prominent human rights defender, Nabeel Rajab, a few days ago, over a tweet posted on his personal Twitter account.\u201d",

They said sales at established stores had fallen and that the company had been affected by a significant drop in the value of the pound against major currencies and an average 17.8% rise in rent on its properties, all of which had put \u201ca significant strain on the cash flow of the business\u201d. \u201cAt this stage, all businesses should continue to trade until further notice. However, we owe it to you as our loyal employees to be honest and say to you that it is highly likely that, devastatingly, there will be job losses in the near future,\u201d the email warned.",

      "bodyText": "George Galloway breached broadcasting impartiality rules when he used his radio show to cast doubt on Russian involvement in the poisoning of Yulia and Sergei Skripal in Salisbury last year, according to media regulator Ofcom. The former MP used his weekly programme on TalkRadio to repeatedly criticise claims of Russian involvement in the incident. He mocked those who agreed with the UK government that the Kremlin was behind the novichok nerve agent attack on the former Russian security agent and his daughter. Ofcom said it was minded to sanction TalkRadio, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News UK, for broadcasting the discussion last March without giving enough time to people with opposing views. Galloway said the media regulator had engaged in a \u201ctransparently politically motivated attempt at censorship\u201d that was designed to stifle his \u201clone voice\u201d on the airwaves. On the show, broadcast 12 days after the poisoning last March, Galloway repeatedly poured scorn on the British government\u2019s claims of Russian involvement in the attempted murder and pointed out that Salisbury was close to the UK\u2019s chemical research laboratory at Porton Down. Galloway suggested there was no reason for Russia to have carried out the attack: \u201cI\u2019m not saying the Russian intelligence services are above such a crime,\u201d he told listeners. \u201cThey have committed many such crimes, just like every other intelligence agency in the world, including \u2013 and perhaps particularly \u2013 our own. Don\u2019t get me started on intelligence services. The question is, why?\u201d Galloway then read 11 text messages from listeners, all broadly supportive of his views on the events in Salisbury, according to Ofcom. At one point, he broke from a discussion with an employee of the leftwing website The Canary to read a tweet from a London taxi driver that said: \u201cI haven\u2019t found a passenger who believes this story all week.\u201d TalkRadio argued that \u201cGalloway\u2019s colourful critique would be regarded by listeners as a highly opinionated personal view attack\u201d and therefore did not require a counterbalance. It said Galloway\u2019s producer made an effort to find guests to appear on the show and make the case for Russian involvement in the Salisbury poisoning, but \u201call of them declined\u201d. The radio station said it had since talked to Galloway about the need to include contrary voices on his show and, if a guest could not be booked, a TalkRadio presenter should come on air to challenge Galloway and provide an alternative viewpoint. The media regulator has already announced its intention to sanction the Kremlin-funded RT television station for breaking impartiality rules following the Salisbury poisoning.

      "bodyText": "Parliament is facing a day of further Brexit deadlock after Theresa May swung the government\u2019s weight behind an amendment that would send her back to Brussels to demand an alternative to the Irish border backstop, splintering Conservative support. The chances of the amendment, championed by the senior backbencher Sir Graham Brady, are on a knife-edge after Tory Brexiters split over whether they should back the change, while pro-remain MPs suggested they would vote against. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the hard-Brexit European Research Group (ERG), emerged from an earlier meeting with MPs saying the group would not back the move. An hour later, other pro-Brexit Tories left a meeting with the prime minister sounding less certain of their opposition. Brady\u2019s amendment would approve May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, but says the government must replace the backstop with \u201calternative arrangements\u201d \u2013 a change that senior EU figures have repeatedly suggested would not be acceptable. May addressed Tory MPs in parliament on Monday night, spelling out her support for Brady and urging them to support the amendment. According to sources, May told the meeting that if the government was going to have \u201ca reasonable chance\u201d of convincing Brussels of the seriousness of the opposition in parliament, then it was a vote that mattered, rather than words. Boris Johnson, who has been at the forefront of demands to reopen the text of the withdrawal agreement to remove the backstop entirely, was publicly rebuked by the prime minister after he asked how the amendment would lead to meaningful change. \u201cWe won\u2019t know until you support us, Boris,\u201d the prime minister retorted, prompting some cheers in the room. \u201cI am happy to battle away. Get behind me and we will do it together.\u201d A friend of Johnson said there had been attempts after the meeting by the No 10 chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, to reassure Johnson that May did intend to reopen the text of the withdrawal agreement. It is likely, however, that pro-Brexit MPs currently opposing the Brady amendment will need public reassurance from the prime minister that this is what she is seeking. Senior Brexiter sources said similar private reassurances had also been given to ERG MPs by the chief whip, Julian Smith. Yet many were spooked by Brady\u2019s comments to the BBC on Sunday night that the change would not require rewriting the agreement, but that a \u201ccodicil\u201d with the new arrangements would suffice. Their concern was compounded after the prime minister declined to repeat those assurances in the meeting, one Brexiter source said. \u201cThat is the main reason why the bulk of the ERG are minded not to support this,\u201d the source said. \u201cIf they vote for this, then they give up leverage for that demand to reopen the text.\u201d May was offered a lifeline late on Monday night as senior Tory Brexiters and remainers including Rees-Mogg and Nicky Morgan threw their weight behind a surprise compromise, backed by ministers, which would involve a redrafting of the backstop and an extended transition period until 2021. The initiative has been called the \u201cMalthouse compromise\u201d after the housing minister Kit Malthouse who coaxed the two warring factions into attempting talks. However, it is still unclear whether the prime minister is prepared to pursue the offer of compromise or if the plan is workable. In a WhatsApp message to Tory MPs, Morgan said the plan \u201cprovides for exit from the EU on time with a new backstop, which would be acceptable indefinitely, but which incentivises us all to reach a new future relationship. It ensures there is no need for a hard border with Ireland\u201d. The Conservative party chair, Brandon Lewis, confirmed that the Tories would be whipped to support Brady\u2019s amendment to a government motion on Tuesday night if it is selected by the Speaker. The success of another amendment tabled by Yvette Cooper, which would pave the way for legislation to delay the article 50 process, also looked uncertain on Monday night as senior Labour figures including Jon Trickett voiced doubt about the message it would send to voters. \u201cI feel that it may look to people as if we\u2019re trying to somehow remove the earlier decision, which was to Brexit,\u201d he said. Without the explicit support of the Labour leadership, the amendment may struggle to win a majority. However, several Labour MPs said they had been reassured that the leadership would swing behind Cooper\u2019s move on Tuesday. The doubts about the backing for both amendments could potentially lead to parliament voting down all possible routes proposed by MPs to break the Brexit impasse. MPs will vote on a number of amendments, yet to be selected by the Speaker, John Bercow, to a government motion that May was obliged to table after the heavy defeat of her Brexit deal. Government sources said they remained highly uncertain whether Bercow would select Brady\u2019s amendment for a vote. Before the vote, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said the prime minister \u201chas offered up no plan B or any credible solution to break the impasse\u201d and demanded that the government spell out the next steps. \u201cWe now need to see action from the government, not further delay or warm words,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prime minister needs to spell out precisely what she plans to negotiate with the EU, a timeline for delivery, and when parliament will next have a say on the terms of any deal the government has negotiated.\u201d May is likely to make a new statement to parliament by 13 February on the next steps for the Brexit process. At their cabinet meeting before Tuesday\u2019s vote, cabinet ministers will urge the prime minister to set out at the dispatch box when MPs will have the chance to vote again on her withdrawal agreement. \u201cShe needs to make a strong and clear statement,\u201d one cabinet source said. The ERG will meet at 6pm on Tuesday night, an hour before the vote, to consider their final verdict on Brady\u2019s amendment and any additional government reassurances. Loyalist Tories piled in behind the amendment after the prime minister gave it her backing at the meeting, queueing up to add at least 20 names to it. Yet some other party moderates remain deeply sceptical of the purpose of the amendment and what May can use it to achieve in Brussels. \u201cIf Brexiteers buy this they\u2019re a total pushover,\u201d one Tory MP said. \u201cIt may as well have said: \u2018I\u2019d like world peace.\u2019 What it does is underline that we don\u2019t have an alternative.\u201d May will also face a core group of rebels from the pro-remain group in her party, who may sink the amendment themselves even if the Brexiters eventually back it. Heidi Allen, one of the Tory MPs backing a second referendum, said: \u201cI cannot believe our prime minister is prepared to renege on an internationally agreed treaty, via a backbench-sponsored amendment.

The road, a small bridge it once crossed, the guesthouse and hundreds of people were all swallowed by mud when a tailings dam at the C\u00f3rrego de Feij\u00e3o mine collapsed on Friday, unleashing a torrent of liquid waste. As the last of the daylight slipped away, a Red Cross team lugged another body in a bag across the devastated landscape and deposited it gently at the roadside for collection. Three days after what seems likely to become Brazil\u2019s worst ever environmental catastrophe, Red Cross rescue worker Walter Moraes said the victim was \u201capparently\u201d a man. \u201cIt is already decomposing,\u201d he said. Hundreds more bodies remain buried. But finding the missing victims poses an almost impossible challenge for the recovery crews: the disaster sent 11.7 m cubic meters (413 m cubic ft) of mining waste thundering through the valley, swamping houses and leaving a sea of clotting mud up to 8m (26ft) deep in some places. So far, 60 bodies have been found near Brumadinho in Minas Gerais state. But, as of Monday afternoon, 292 people were still missing \u2013 and hopes were fading fast that there will be any survivors. Nobody has been brought out of the disaster area alive since Saturday. Frustrated with official rescue efforts, some locals have started searching for bodies themselves, said Petterson Chaves, 23, who stood watching nearby. \u201cThe people can\u2019t stand there waiting for friends and relatives,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re out there hunting [for them].\u201d Among the missing is Chaves\u2019s aunt Elisabeth Reis, 49, a cook at the opencast mining complex where the 86-metre-high tailings dam collapsed on Friday afternoon, releasing the devastating red wave.

If the 18-year-old does join the German club, he will follow Jadon Sancho, who signed for Borussia Dortmund in summer 2017, and Brahim D\u00edaz, who left for Real Madrid this month. However it is understood City are not worried that this represents a concerning trend of promising youngsters departing, instead believing each player has a unique set of circumstances. There is a confidence at the club that City\u2019s youth setup is producing a number of potential first-team players who are bound to attract attention from outside and bids. Matondo made his Wales debut in a friendly against Albania in November but has never played for City\u2019s first team and the club are thought to be privately delighted with the fee agreed with Schalke.

Whereas Sancho never played for the first team, D\u00edaz was being eased into the squad, making 14 appearances while Foden has made 28. The closest Matondo has got to senior football was on last summer\u2019s pre-season tour of the US; he was never selected by Guardiola in the squad for a competitive match. Guardiola, asked on Monday about Matondo\u2019s prospective move to Schalke, whom City play in the Champions League last-16 tie next month, was hardly effusive in his assessment of the player. \u201cYeah, I have some comments \u2013 I know how good he is, incredibly fast winger, and a young talent,\u201d the manager said. \u201cThis club is working so good. All the players in the academy, we trust them. If they want to be patient and stay; if they want to leave, they leave.\u201d A host of other clubs were interested in Matondo, whose contract expires next summer, but Schalke met City\u2019s valuation. Once this occurred the club decided not to make a concerted play to retain him, as they did with Sancho and D\u00edaz, who were each offered contracts competitive with, respectively, Dortmund and Real.",

The Tory MP Ken Clarke said of Abbott: \u201cShe\u2019s actually been making an extremely coherent root-and-branch criticism of the bill, and she has an excellent record on these things; but the problem is, we\u2019re meant to be debating whether this House of Commons will approve the second reading of the bill. \u201cShe\u2019s denouncing it from beginning to end, but is saying the opposition don\u2019t intend to vote against it. This makes the proceedings quite absurd.\u201d",

Top stories The Coalition faces a fresh electoral challenge with the former Liberal member Oliver Yates preparing to stand as an independent in Josh Frydenberg\u2019s seat of Kooyong. Scott Morrison will give a speech in Brisbane today promising the Coalition will create 1.25m jobs in the next five years, boosted by the first Newspoll of the year, which shows the Coalition has improved its position from December\u2019s grim showing. There is also speculation that the former Liberal Julia Banks, who quit the government for the crossbench last year, will run against the health minister, Greg Hunt, in the Victorian seat of Flinders. Child abuse survivors and advocates will today stage a protest at the \u201cRed Mass\u201d, an annual church service held in Catholic cathedrals in Sydney and Melbourne to mark the start of the legal year. Leonie Sheedy, the chief executive of the Care Leavers Australasia Network, said the church and state should be separate and, given how many abuse cases involved the Catholic church, the services represented a potential conflict. \u201cIf legal professions want to go to church, they can go in their own time \u2013 not on the taxpayers\u2019 time,\u201d Sheedy said. \u201cWe want to know that the people hearing abuse cases involving Catholic institutions and Catholic clergy are fair and impartial.\u201d Transparency advocates have criticised Facebook for changes that make it harder to monitor political advertising on the platform just months out from the federal election. One of the affected groups, the US-based not-for-profit investigative journalism outfit ProPublica, developed a tool used by organisations in Australia \u2013 including Guardian Australia \u2013 to monitor the way political advertising is being deployed.

Such ads would have otherwise been visible only to those who had been deliberately targeted. World The risk of the UK accidentally crashing out of the EU without a deal has been described as \u201cvery high\u201d by a key EU architect of the Brexit deal, with any parliamentary backing for changes to the backstop likely to be met by a brick wall in Brussels. US and Taliban officials have agreed in principle to the framework of a deal that could pave the way for peace talks in Kabul and ultimately the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, raising hopes of a breakthrough in the country\u2019s 17-year conflict. Greece\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has announced the first increase to the country\u2019s minimum wage in nearly a decade as his government took the first tangible step towards ending the austerity imposed during the euro crisis. Pope Francis has said he fears bloodshed in Venezuela as the South American country braces for a week of fresh protests against its embattled president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Authorities in the United Arab Emirates have been ridiculed after it emerged that all the winners of an initiative designed to foster gender equality in the workplace were men.

Now the North Melbourne recruit has become the second former Hockeyroo to join the AFLW \u2013 and she believes more are likely to follow.

They were shown around the scanner beforehand to ensure they felt comfortable going inside when the drug took hold. Had the machine suddenly taken on a threatening demeanour, the scans might not have come out so well.</p> <p>The scientists wanted to test a hypothesis first put forward more than a decade ago. It states LSD causes the thalamus to stop filtering information it relays to other parts of the brain. It is the breakdown of this filter that gives rise to the weird effects the drug induces, or so the thinking goes.</p> <p>\u201cThe world around us is not the world we perceive because the thalamus filters out what it considers to be irrelevant information,\u201d said Katrin Preller, a researcher on the project at the University Hospital for Psychiatry in Zurich. \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily perceive all there is because that would be an overload of information.\u201d</p> <p>Scans of the volunteers\u2019 brains suggested there may be some truth to the hypothesis. On LSD, the thalamus let more information through to some parts of the brain and suppressed information bound for others. \u201cWhat we found is that the model is mostly true, but how information is distributed to the cortex under LSD is much more specific than it predicts,\u201d said Preller.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/apr/12/brain-scans-lsd-acid-trip-imperial-college-london-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4t9pk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2487314\"            data-video-name=\"Tripping on LSD could unlock child-like creativity \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-570cf379e4b000f4571255d6\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/04/12/160412LSD_1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/04/12/160412LSD_1_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/04/12/160412LSD_1_synd_768k_vp8-1.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/04/12/160412LSD_1_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/04/12/160412LSD_1.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/apr/12/brain-scans-lsd-acid-trip-imperial-college-london-video\">Tripping on LSD could unlock child-like creativity</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It is unclear how messing with the flow of information in the brain gives rise to particular sensations linked to LSD, but there are some hints from previous work. The posterior cingulate cortex, for example, is thought to play a role in <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(15)00412-1\">shaping one\u2019s sense of self</a>, so overloading it might drive feelings of self-disintegration.</p> <p>LSD, or lysergic acid diethylamide, was first synthesised in 1938 and had a profound impact on psychology and psychiatric research throughout the 1950s and 60s. While its adoption as a recreational drug led to it being banned, many scientists now suspect it could be a powerful new weapon in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/01/first-ever-trials-on-the-effects-of-microdosing-lsd-set-to-begin\">battle against depression</a> and other mental disorders.</p> <p>\u201cWe are getting nearer to understanding the complexity of what happens with LSD in the brain and that is particularly important if we are to develop new medicines,\u201d said Preller.

      "bodyText": "A group of volunteers who took a trip in the name of science have helped researchers uncover how LSD messes with activity in the brain to induce an altered state of consciousness. Brain scans of individuals high on the drug revealed that the chemical allows parts of the cortex to become flooded with signals that are normally filtered out to prevent information overload. The drug allowed more information to flow from the thalamus, a kind of neural gatekeeper, to a region called the posterior cingulate cortex, and it stemmed the flow of information to another part known as the temporal cortex. This disruption in communication may underpin some of the wacky effects reported by LSD users, from feelings of bliss and being at one with the universe to hallucinations and what scientists in the field refer to as \u201cego dissolution\u201d, where one\u2019s sense of self disintegrates. For the study, the researchers invited 25 healthy participants into the lab to be scanned under the influence of LSD and, on another occasion, after taking a placebo. They were shown around the scanner beforehand to ensure they felt comfortable going inside when the drug took hold. Had the machine suddenly taken on a threatening demeanour, the scans might not have come out so well. The scientists wanted to test a hypothesis first put forward more than a decade ago. It states LSD causes the thalamus to stop filtering information it relays to other parts of the brain. It is the breakdown of this filter that gives rise to the weird effects the drug induces, or so the thinking goes. \u201cThe world around us is not the world we perceive because the thalamus filters out what it considers to be irrelevant information,\u201d said Katrin Preller, a researcher on the project at the University Hospital for Psychiatry in Zurich. \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily perceive all there is because that would be an overload of information.\u201d Scans of the volunteers\u2019 brains suggested there may be some truth to the hypothesis. On LSD, the thalamus let more information through to some parts of the brain and suppressed information bound for others. \u201cWhat we found is that the model is mostly true, but how information is distributed to the cortex under LSD is much more specific than it predicts,\u201d said Preller. It is unclear how messing with the flow of information in the brain gives rise to particular sensations linked to LSD, but there are some hints from previous work. The posterior cingulate cortex, for example, is thought to play a role in shaping one\u2019s sense of self, so overloading it might drive feelings of self-disintegration. LSD, or lysergic acid diethylamide, was first synthesised in 1938 and had a profound impact on psychology and psychiatric research throughout the 1950s and 60s. While its adoption as a recreational drug led to it being banned, many scientists now suspect it could be a powerful new weapon in the battle against depression and other mental disorders. \u201cWe are getting nearer to understanding the complexity of what happens with LSD in the brain and that is particularly important if we are to develop new medicines,\u201d said Preller. The latest research is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The work follows a major study in 2016 which found that under the influence of LSD, the brain recruited many more regions for visual processing than normal, enriching the images people saw even when their eyes were shut. The research was the first to show what the brain looks like on LSD on a modern scanner.",

You could, of course, be saddened by the fact that the original environment has disappeared. When you move a cultural heritage to a museum, you move it outside. However, this shifting is also a creative act.\u201d</p> <p>The same could be said for the Acropolis Museum created in Athens, said Fischer. \u201cNothing that we admire at the Acropolis Museum was created for the Acropolis Museum.

      "bodyText": "The director of the British Museum has provoked anger by suggesting the removal of the Parthenon marbles from Greece in the 19th century could be seen as \u201ca creative act\u201d. Hartwig Fischer gave an interview to the Greek newspaper Ta Nea in which he ruled out returning the 2,500-year-old sculptures, which many people in Greece and elsewhere regard as stolen. Greece desperately wants the sculptures, popularly known as the Elgin marbles, back but has been rebuffed repeatedly by the British Museum. Asked about the argument that it should be seen more as a rejoining of the sculptures than a return, Fischer said the British Museum offered a different way of interacting with the marbles, \u201cposing different questions because the objects are placed in a new context\u201d. He added: \u201cWe should appreciate this opportunity. You could, of course, be saddened by the fact that the original environment has disappeared. When you move a cultural heritage to a museum, you move it outside. However, this shifting is also a creative act.\u201d The same could be said for the Acropolis Museum created in Athens, said Fischer. \u201cNothing that we admire at the Acropolis Museum was created for the Acropolis Museum. They are close to the original environment, but they have again moved away from it and have been transformed through this act.\u201d There are many who will not see the early 19th-century removal from Greece of the marbles by agents of the 7th Earl of Elgin as \u201ccreative\u201d.

There would only be a possibility of a loan if Greece were to recognise the British Museum\u2019s legitimate ownership of the marbles, he added. Myrsini Zorba, the Greek culture minister, issued a statement on Saturday condemning Fischer\u2019s \u201clegitimate owner\u201d comments as exhibiting \u201ca narrow and cynical managerial mindset\u201d. \u201cIt is regrettable to hear this by the director of the British Museum and a well-known art historian.

He has got to keep the profit margin promises he\u2019s made to the City and the grumble about the market being \u201ccompetitive and challenging\u201d obviously has force. But it is hard to believe Lewis, when he set out his turnaround plans in 2015, intended still to be swinging the axe so vigorously in 2019. In that respect, the financial revival of Tesco has been a disappointment, which is roughly what the share price says. Within a few pennies, it is where it was when the \u00a34m-a-year boss arrived to save the day.</p> <h2>Flybe shareholders deserve answers</h2> <p>Simon Laffin will have annoyed many investors during his stint as chairman of Flybe. The share price has plummeted on his five-year watch and he intends his final act to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/11/flybe-urges-shareholders-accept-cut-price-takeover-offer-virgin-atlantic-led-consortium\">a sale of the regional airline </a>for just 1p-a-share, or \u00a32m, to a consortium led by Virgin Atlantic.</p> <p>Investors\u2019 mood will not have improved after the twist to the deal a fortnight ago. Instead of giving shareholders a meaningful vote on the takeover, Laffin &amp; co agreed to flog the core assets to the Virgin consortium at the same price. The manoeuvre was technically legitimate but will have felt unfair.</p> <p>In the circumstances, it is no surprise that Hosking Partners, with a 19% stake, thinks it\u2019s time to drop the pilot and install the airline veteran Eric Kohn to inspect Laffin\u2019s handiwork. It wants shareholders to vote and probably stands a good chance of attracting support.</p> <p>A gamechanger for Flybe\u2019s suffering investors? Well, no. Shareholders meetings do not have to happen immediately and Flybe is allowed to string things out until March, beyond the 22 February \u201clongstop\u201d date for completing the asset disposal. By that stage, a vote may have little practical impact.</p> <p>Yet it is not entirely pointless. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/jan/16/flybes-sale-is-right-for-staff-and-passengers\">argued here</a> a fortnight ago, the cut-price deal with the Virgin crew was probably defensible: if there was a risk of collapse, the board had to put the interests of staff, customers and pensioners first. But a correct deal at the eleventh hour does not explain why Flybe waited so long to put itself up for sale. On that score, the shareholders still deserve a proper answer.</p> <h2>Retailers leave it late to shout out over Brexit</h2> <p>A no-deal Brexit would lead to higher prices in supermarkets and \u201csignificant\u201d supply-chain disruption in the short-term, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/28/no-deal-brexit-price-rises-retailers-sainsburys-asda-ms-coop\">agree the chief executives</a> of Asda, the Co-op, Lidl, Marks &amp; Spencer, Sainsbury\u2019s, Waitrose and others. The forecasts, set out in a letter to MPs, sound entirely plausible. But they have also arrived late in the day.</p> <p>In private, many of the same individuals have made even starker warnings for ages. Why wait to go public? And why huddle together under a group letter, which tends to lessen the impact? The answer is the corporate fear of going out of a limb.</p> <p>It\u2019s a shame. A lesson from the industry frontline in WTO tariffs, and their potential \u201cdevastating\u201d effect on UK farming, would have been welcome many months ago. The grocery chiefs should have taken a lesson from Airbus. Shout early and often.</p>",

In that respect, the financial revival of Tesco has been a disappointment, which is roughly what the share price says. Within a few pennies, it is where it was when the \u00a34m-a-year boss arrived to save the day. Flybe shareholders deserve answers Simon Laffin will have annoyed many investors during his stint as chairman of Flybe. The share price has plummeted on his five-year watch and he intends his final act to be a sale of the regional airline for just 1p-a-share, or \u00a32m, to a consortium led by Virgin Atlantic. Investors\u2019 mood will not have improved after the twist to the deal a fortnight ago. Instead of giving shareholders a meaningful vote on the takeover, Laffin &amp; co agreed to flog the core assets to the Virgin consortium at the same price. The manoeuvre was technically legitimate but will have felt unfair. In the circumstances, it is no surprise that Hosking Partners, with a 19% stake, thinks it\u2019s time to drop the pilot and install the airline veteran Eric Kohn to inspect Laffin\u2019s handiwork. It wants shareholders to vote and probably stands a good chance of attracting support. A gamechanger for Flybe\u2019s suffering investors? Well, no. Shareholders meetings do not have to happen immediately and Flybe is allowed to string things out until March, beyond the 22 February \u201clongstop\u201d date for completing the asset disposal. By that stage, a vote may have little practical impact. Yet it is not entirely pointless. As argued here a fortnight ago, the cut-price deal with the Virgin crew was probably defensible: if there was a risk of collapse, the board had to put the interests of staff, customers and pensioners first. But a correct deal at the eleventh hour does not explain why Flybe waited so long to put itself up for sale. On that score, the shareholders still deserve a proper answer. Retailers leave it late to shout out over Brexit A no-deal Brexit would lead to higher prices in supermarkets and \u201csignificant\u201d supply-chain disruption in the short-term, agree the chief executives of Asda, the Co-op, Lidl, Marks &amp; Spencer, Sainsbury\u2019s, Waitrose and others. The forecasts, set out in a letter to MPs, sound entirely plausible. But they have also arrived late in the day. In private, many of the same individuals have made even starker warnings for ages. Why wait to go public? And why huddle together under a group letter, which tends to lessen the impact? The answer is the corporate fear of going out of a limb. It\u2019s a shame. A lesson from the industry frontline in WTO tariffs, and their potential \u201cdevastating\u201d effect on UK farming, would have been welcome many months ago. The grocery chiefs should have taken a lesson from Airbus. Shout early and often.",

Cases were delayed, access to the courts\u2019 digital case system was denied and jurors could not be enrolled.</p> <p>The justice minister Lucy Frazer was forced to answer emergency questions in the Commons last Wednesday during which she said there had not been a cyber-attack and also denied the problems were the result of financial cuts.</p> <p>The internal review, however, makes it clear that long-term underfunding is at the heart of computer weaknesses in the MoJ. The department, which has to pay for courts, prisons and probation, has suffered larger cuts than any other in Whitehall since 2010. Its current funding level is almost 40% lower than it was in 2010.</p> <p>The MoJ document, entitled Digital &amp; Technology, says: \u201cHistorical under-investment in ageing IT systems has built our technical debt to unacceptable levels and we are carrying significant risk that will result in a large-scale data breach if the vulnerabilities are exploited.\u201d</p> <p>It adds: \u201cWe have a Technology 2022 strategy, but it is not funded to help us address the long-term issues with current systems and allow us to make best use of new technologies to improve service delivery.\u201d</p> <p>In one case study it refers to a database used by 16 employment tribunal administrative offices in which the \u201cscale of outage\u201d accounted for 33% of incidents over the previous six months.

      "bodyText": "The Ministry of Justice knew its court computer systems were \u201cobsolete\u201d and \u201cout of support\u201d long before the network went into meltdown last week, internal documents have revealed. An MoJ digital and technology review warned last year that judges in employment tribunals were threatening to stop hearing cases because of the unreliability of communications and 30,000 users were on systems that needed \u201cimmediate remediation\u201d. The detailed assessment seen by the Guardian blames \u201chistorical under-investment in ageing IT systems\u201d and warns that it is reaching \u201cunacceptable levels\u201d of risk which could result in large-scale data breaches. Courts across England and Wales have been disrupted over the past two weeks because of successive IT failures which began when the criminal justice secure email system went down, depriving 75,000 lawyers and staff of communications. The MoJ\u2019s main computer network linking lawyers, judges, probation workers and court staff also malfunctioned. Cases were delayed, access to the courts\u2019 digital case system was denied and jurors could not be enrolled. The justice minister Lucy Frazer was forced to answer emergency questions in the Commons last Wednesday during which she said there had not been a cyber-attack and also denied the problems were the result of financial cuts. The internal review, however, makes it clear that long-term underfunding is at the heart of computer weaknesses in the MoJ. The department, which has to pay for courts, prisons and probation, has suffered larger cuts than any other in Whitehall since 2010. Its current funding level is almost 40% lower than it was in 2010. The MoJ document, entitled Digital &amp; Technology, says: \u201cHistorical under-investment in ageing IT systems has built our technical debt to unacceptable levels and we are carrying significant risk that will result in a large-scale data breach if the vulnerabilities are exploited.\u201d It adds: \u201cWe have a Technology 2022 strategy, but it is not funded to help us address the long-term issues with current systems and allow us to make best use of new technologies to improve service delivery.\u201d In one case study it refers to a database used by 16 employment tribunal administrative offices in which the \u201cscale of outage\u201d accounted for 33% of incidents over the previous six months. Users were unable to access systems for a \u201csignificant number of hours\u201d. The report cites problems such as \u201crisk of database corrupted leading to data loss; unable to restore service in a timely manner\u201d, and adds: \u201cJudges say they will put tribunal activity on hold because of the poor running of the application.\u201d Addressing what are said to be \u201csecondary risks\u201d, the document notes: \u201cFailure to reduce and prevent technical debt leading to a continued reliance on obsolete and out-of-support systems that may lead to operational failure and cyber-breach.\u201d The document also contains a series of colour-coded levels relating to \u201ccriticality\u201d, ranging from the worst, black, to the least dangerous, green. Among those in the black category were 30,000 users whose systems required \u201cimmediate remediation\u201d. The MoJ said the document was a routine risk assessment of its computer systems. The case study referred to in the document is understood to relate to a different system to the one that broke down last week. A spokesperson said: \u201cLike any responsible organisation, we carry out regular assessments of risks to ensure that we can identify and manage them. \u201cIt would be entirely wrong to suggest that last week\u2019s IT issues were caused by us ignoring a risk assessment. We have always been clear that there are a number of outdated IT systems that need replacing which is why we continuously review our IT infrastructure and invest accordingly.\u201d Commenting on last week\u2019s courtroom IT chaos, Chris Henley QC, the chair of the Criminal Bar Association, wrote in a message to members: \u201cWhatever the reasons, and whatever the fix, has anything been more emblematic of the deep and worsening crisis in the criminal justice system than the collapse of IT systems in courts across the country last week? \u201cTrials adjourned, evidence inaccessible, secure emails vanishing, wifi down, Xhibit just a blank screen, prisons beyond communication, the stuff of satire, and a high-profile media story for several days \u2026 But it\u2019s OK, it had nothing to do with a chronic lack of resources.\u201d",

At 35, he was a junior member of his party but its leaders were either under house arrest, in hiding or in exile.</p>\n    <p>He declared himself \"interim president\" that month, resting his claim on a clause in the constitution that allows the legislature to take power temporarily and call new elections if it deems the president to be failing to fulfil basic duties or to have vacated the post.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Guaid\u00f3's relative obscurity initially proved an advantage in a country where the opposition has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/latin-america-caribbean/andes/venezuela/71-friendly-fire-venezuelas-opposition-turmoil\">generally failed to distinguish itself</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/10/venezuela-lopez-tintori-maduro/541752/\">losing its nerve</a>&nbsp;at critical moments, succumbing to infighting, and getting involved in a failed coup against Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 2002.</p>\n    <p>He inspired a huge wave of protests inside Venezuela with a message of peaceful change, and won widespread international support.

Police said they believed the teenager, a member of the Roma community who is originally from Slovakia, was in Sheffield but too afraid to return to her home in the city. \u201cI want to make a direct appeal [to Pamela] that we are here to support her and that she is not in trouble,\u201d said Supt Paul McCurry. \u201cI genuinely believe she is still here.\u201d McCurry believes language barriers may be preventing anyone with information on Pamela from coming forward. She does not own a phone, but McCurry said he strongly believed she had used a mobile phone and he asked anybody who had given her access to one to contact police. \u201cSomewhere, somebody knows where Pamela is and I need them to come forward. She has a bright future ahead of her and I want to make sure she is OK,\u201d he said. South Yorkshire police issued the appeal in a news conference at Fir Vale school on Monday night. Tensions between students at the school led to rioting in September, in an area of Sheffield that has seen community conflict. CCTV footage shows Pamela leaving school on 18 December wearing a black jacket and hoodie, blue jeans and trainers. The Roma community hosted events over the weekend to raise awareness of her disappearance. South Yorkshire police have driven a van around Sheffield displaying Pamela\u2019s photo and a message in Slovak appealing for information. McCurry said the Roma community had a \u201chistorical lack of trust in the police\u201d, but that the van campaign was a positive sign of them working together to find the teenager. The last confirmed sighting of Pamela was at the iceSheffield rink on 19 December. Police divers have searched rivers and canals. \u201cEvery bit of information we can get, hopefully someone will get it to us and assist us,\u201d McCurry said.",

Paul Casey made it clear last week that he would not travel on human rights grounds \u2013 a view shared by plenty of others who have opted to keep counsel.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to look at the entire Middle East region,\u201d Pelley said. \u201cWe have an excellent relationship with the Middle East and it\u2019s very important; why it\u2019s important is we can\u2019t play anywhere in Europe at this time of year.

But must that arrive at all costs?</p> <p>To his credit, the Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee highlighted the Tour\u2019s woefully bad call.</p> <p>\u201cI cannot imagine what economic incentive it would take to get me to go to a place that is so egregiously on the wrong side of human rights,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they fully understand what they are doing.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand it from an economic point of view, I don\u2019t understand it from a business point of view and I don\u2019t understand it from a moral point of view.

      "bodyText": "Golf\u2019s obsession with irrelevance was in evidence again on Sunday. That Li Haotong\u2019s caddie was adjudged to have assisted the player with the lining up of a putt in the final round of the Dubai Desert Classic cost the defending champion by way of a two-stroke penalty. Commentators, players and caddies blasted this marginal call, rendered possible by recent amendments to the rules of golf. Muirfield\u2019s members had fresh meat to titter about over Monday gins. By Monday afternoon, the European Tour and the R&amp;A were at odds regarding the implementation of said rule. Keith Pelley, the Tour\u2019s chief executive, bemoaned the lack of discretion available to his referees. Sceptics may suggest Pelley was seeking to create controversy where one does not exist in the hope of creating a handy diversion. Pelley had earlier appeared on television in the US attempting to do something which is never wise; defending the indefensible. If Pelley\u2019s willingness to cut a deal to host a tour event in Saudi Arabia caused minor ripples when announced last year, subsequent events and the fact this tournament begins on Thursday has thrust a reputational own goal firmly back into the spotlight. Suffice to say the R&amp;A, which many feel allowed gender discrimination to prevail on its watch for centuries, has kept out of this one. Recurring horrors in relation to Saudi Arabia and human rights barely need revisiting. The CIA\u2019s claim in November that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, most likely ordered the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi added a further layer of negativity \u2013 to put it mildly \u2013 that the European Tour could have done without. There have also been reports of the torture and sexual harassment of women\u2019s rights activists in Saudi detention centres. As it attempts to show the world it is actually a misunderstood utopia, Saudi Arabia turned towards the world\u2019s leading golfers; and found a depressingly willing audience. Four of the world\u2019s top five are scheduled to tee up in Saudi. That comes with hefty reward; Justin Rose, Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka et al are being richly compensated by way of appearance fees for just turning up. Low-ranked players might feel a necessity to play as they battle to maintain status. Paul Casey made it clear last week that he would not travel on human rights grounds \u2013 a view shared by plenty of others who have opted to keep counsel. \u201cYou have to look at the entire Middle East region,\u201d Pelley said. \u201cWe have an excellent relationship with the Middle East and it\u2019s very important; why it\u2019s important is we can\u2019t play anywhere in Europe at this time of year. Saudi is just an extension of the Middle East strategy. \u201cThe European Tour is one of many global companies who operate in Saudi Arabia. We understand their goal to make parts of the country more accessible to global business, tourism and leisure over the next decade.\u201d If not so serious, this would of course be hilarious. Here is a sporting body which penalises competitors for making an error with a scorecard yet thinks it reasonable to go cap in hand to a regime which, according to Amnesty International, oversaw the execution of 146 people in 2017. What Pelley understandably fails to mention in regards to Saudi Arabia is commercial necessity as his tour falls further and further behind its US equivalent. But must that arrive at all costs? To his credit, the Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee highlighted the Tour\u2019s woefully bad call. \u201cI cannot imagine what economic incentive it would take to get me to go to a place that is so egregiously on the wrong side of human rights,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they fully understand what they are doing. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it from an economic point of view, I don\u2019t understand it from a business point of view and I don\u2019t understand it from a moral point of view. They are legitimising and enriching the rulers of this regime. I won\u2019t even watch it on the TV. They should not be there. By participating, they are ventriloquists for this abhorrent, reprehensible regime.\u201d Rose shrugged off such a notion. \u201cI\u2019m not a politician, I\u2019m a pro golfer,\u201d the Englishman said. \u201cThere are other reasons to go play it. It\u2019s a good field, there\u2019s going to be a lot of world ranking points to play for, by all accounts it\u2019s a good golf course.\u201d Rose\u2019s explanation isn\u2019t good enough, not least for someone so intelligent.

It\u2019s one of many awkward attempts to truly embed Springsteen\u2019s music in the film, rather than just having it play as a soundtrack and while ambitious, Chadha can\u2019t seem to make them work.

The script becomes as over-reliant on his music as Javed is, resorting to his lyrics to make profound statements rather than inventing anything original. The film takes place on such a broad level that characters are reduced to caricatures and the forced emotional conflict has the depth of a daytime soap, true involvement in the story ebbing away with each scene.

The print was the \u201cicing on the cake\u201d.</p> <p>The thumbprint has been researched in detail for a book being published by the trust that sheds light on Leonardo\u2019s drawing methods, tools and materials.</p> <p>Clayton said the book did not reveal anything totally new but was \u201cmuch more a gradual, painstaking accumulation of lots of bits of evidence about how he worked as a draughtsman\u201d.</p> <p>It showed how \u201cdown to earth\u201d Leonardo was, Clayton said. \u201cHow much he was a practising artist rolling up his sleeves and getting on with the task of drawing. So many people think of Leonardo as this ivory-towered genius, not of this world almost.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Leonardo da Vinci: A Close Look by Alan Donnithorne is published on 1 February.</p>",

Curators hope the imprint will bring people closer to the Italian master than ever before. \u201cYou can really feel the man at work on this drawing, with his inky fingers,\u201d said Martin Clayton, the head of prints and drawings at the Royal Collection Trust. \u201cThat makes me feel a little tingly.\u201d The print is in the centre of the left edge of one of his drawings, of the cardiovascular system and principal organs of a woman, circa 1509\u201310. \u201cIt has been observed before but it is the first time we\u2019ve really stood back from it and said this is actually quite something,\u201d said Clayton. \u201cThere are smudges and partial prints on Leonardo\u2019s other drawings, but this is far and away the crispest, clearest, most definite Leonardo thumbprint or fingerprint.\u201d The work is part of the greatest collection of Leonardo drawings in the world, owned by the Royal Collection, and is normally viewable by appointment only at Windsor Castle. It will feature in one of 12 simultaneous exhibitions of Leonardo drawings in cities across the UK next month. The drawing will go on display at National Museum Cardiff with the public for the first time alerted to the thumbprint\u2019s existence. \u201cThis is as close as you are ever going to get to Leonardo, when you can see his print as clearly as this,\u201d said Clayton. \u201cIt is so clear it almost looks deliberate.\u201d He said the drawing itself was \u201cpossibly the most complex of Leonardo\u2019s drawings \u2013 there is a lot to see\u201d. The print was the \u201cicing on the cake\u201d. The thumbprint has been researched in detail for a book being published by the trust that sheds light on Leonardo\u2019s drawing methods, tools and materials. Clayton said the book did not reveal anything totally new but was \u201cmuch more a gradual, painstaking accumulation of lots of bits of evidence about how he worked as a draughtsman\u201d. It showed how \u201cdown to earth\u201d Leonardo was, Clayton said. \u201cHow much he was a practising artist rolling up his sleeves and getting on with the task of drawing. So many people think of Leonardo as this ivory-towered genius, not of this world almost.\u201d \u2022 Leonardo da Vinci: A Close Look by Alan Donnithorne is published on 1 February.",

      "bodyText": "A hi-tech unmanned submarine will be used to scour the seabed off the Channel Islands for wreckage of the plane that was carrying the footballer Emiliano Sala as part of a family-led operation funded by fellow players and well-wishers. The expert leading the search said they would use the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to comb an area of around 25 square nautical miles and they believed there was a good chance of finding the plane, which vanished on Monday last week en route from Nantes in France to Cardiff. David Mearns, a specialist in finding shipwrecks, said that if the plane\u2019s wreckage was located, the next step would be to try to recover it. He said Sala\u2019s family was determined to establish what happened to the Argentinian footballer. Details of the private search were revealed as the Cardiff City manager, Neil Warnock, said he has questioned his own future at the club following the disappearance of the plane. \u201cYou think 24 hours a day about whether to carry on,\u201d Warnock said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to sleep.

Pleas for the official search to resume have come from the 28-year-old player\u2019s family, the Argentinian footballers Lionel Messi, Diego Maradona and Sergio Ag\u00fcero, and the country\u2019s president, Mauricio Macri. Donations from footballers including Manchester City\u2019s \u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan helped a GoFundMe page raising money for a private search to pass the \u20ac300,000 (\u00a3260,000) target. On Monday, a week after Sala and Ibbotson vanished, members of Sala\u2019s family chartered a plane and re-traced the flight path of the lost aircraft to try to help them build a picture of what happened. Two fishing boats continued to search the area just north of Guernsey where contact with the plane was lost. Speaking at Guernsey airport with members of Sala\u2019s family beside him, Mearns said a search vessel was being mobilised and was expected to be in the area by the end of the week, although poor weather conditions mean it may be delayed until the weekend. \u201cWe are getting ready for the next phase, which will be the underwater search,\u201d said Mearns of Blue Water Recoveries.

With 60 days to go until 29 March, and just 30 of those working days, the government admits it is running out of time to get the necessary primary and secondary legislation through parliament by Brexit day. Downing Street said for the first time it had begun planning for parliament to sit on Fridays, at weekends and at half-term so that it could meet the deadline \u2013 if, that is, Theresa May can get her Brexit deal approved in principle by MPs soon. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cAs a precautionary measure, we are in preliminary discussion about extending sitting times \u2013 but only if necessary.\u201d Some of the legislation is needed to avoid no-deal scenarios such as a lack of reciprocal healthcare for British pensioners in Spain.

And they are much cannier than this book allows</a>, Review, 26 January) smartly points out the battle-hardened resilience of Britain\u2019s private schools and how difficult they are to budge from their entrenched position in our poor, divided society.</p> <p>Kynaston, Clanchy, and (not to forget) Melissa Benn clearly do good work promoting rational debate on the issue, but all of them consistently ignore the body of work that my colleagues and I have been presenting for the past three decades, highlighting the psychological problems of our private education.</p> <p>Until we acknowledge how subbing out parenting to elite institutions produces a transgenerational problem with attachments and spawns an uncreative, anachronistic and entitled elite (consider Jacob Rees-Mogg, for example), a morbid rigidity in social classes, a fear of Europeans who prefer state education, and promotes that very divisiveness, we are still making it far too easy to fail at becoming a proper social democracy.<br><strong>Nick Duffell</strong><br><em>Author of </em><em>Wounded Leaders</em><em> and </em><em>The Making of Them</em></p> <p>\u2022 Kate Clanchy misrepresents or ignores key aspects of our argument in her review of our book.</p> <p>First, she condemns as insufficiently ambitious our proposed Fair Access Scheme, by which one-third of places would be allocated on a state-funded basis, but does not mention that we explicitly see that as an initial ratio, with a view to it increasing significantly over time. Nor does she mention our emphasis on how the criteria for these places would be determined by government, not the schools themselves.

      "bodyText": "Kate Clanchy\u2019s polished review of David Kynaston and Francis Green\u2019s Engines of Privilege: Britain\u2019s Private School Problem (The unfairness of fee-paying schools affects all our lives. And they are much cannier than this book allows, Review, 26 January) smartly points out the battle-hardened resilience of Britain\u2019s private schools and how difficult they are to budge from their entrenched position in our poor, divided society. Kynaston, Clanchy, and (not to forget) Melissa Benn clearly do good work promoting rational debate on the issue, but all of them consistently ignore the body of work that my colleagues and I have been presenting for the past three decades, highlighting the psychological problems of our private education. Until we acknowledge how subbing out parenting to elite institutions produces a transgenerational problem with attachments and spawns an uncreative, anachronistic and entitled elite (consider Jacob Rees-Mogg, for example), a morbid rigidity in social classes, a fear of Europeans who prefer state education, and promotes that very divisiveness, we are still making it far too easy to fail at becoming a proper social democracy. Nick Duffell Author of Wounded Leaders and The Making of Them \u2022 Kate Clanchy misrepresents or ignores key aspects of our argument in her review of our book. First, she condemns as insufficiently ambitious our proposed Fair Access Scheme, by which one-third of places would be allocated on a state-funded basis, but does not mention that we explicitly see that as an initial ratio, with a view to it increasing significantly over time. Nor does she mention our emphasis on how the criteria for these places would be determined by government, not the schools themselves. And, contrary to her claim, we certainly do not say that the schools would like the scheme. Second, she depicts as naive our approach to the private sector. Given that we devote pages 237-45 to what a formidable and entrenched vested interest it is, supplemented by brilliant marketing and PR, this seems strange. More generally, we regret her largely dismissive tone. In terms of the big picture, the three of us are surely on the same side.

Designed barely a decade before Pimlico school, the glass pyramid pushed contemporary technology to the limits. The commissioning rabbi, Mortimer Cohen, and his successors have tolerated the inconveniences in the knowledge that they were guardians of an architectural treasure. How different the petty, visionless attitude of the \u201cguardians\u201d of Pimlico school, an architectural triumph that attracted international critical acclaim and huge numbers of admiring visitors from around the world. This is not to dismiss the technical issues but to recognise that technology advances and that the problems could now be resolved, as they are currently being addressed at Beth Shalom. The demolition of Pimlico school is arguably the most philistine architectural destruction since the demolition of the Euston Arch.

He began the autumn in the No 7 jersey but was injured again in England\u2019s opening match and such was Sam Underhill\u2019s form thereafter that it is hard to imagine Curry would have come straight back in to the side but for the Bath flanker\u2019s similarly awful luck with injuries. Curry then is set for another chance to answer the ongoing question as to who is Eddie Jones\u2019s first-choice openside. The 20-year-old was one of the few shining lights of England\u2019s tour of South Africa last summer and has more in his attacking armoury than Underhill. He is an effective operator at the breakdown but if there is one concern about Curry it is that he struggles to adapt if on the wrong side of the officials.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jan/27/six-nations-preview-shadow-of-world-cup-special-edge\">Shadow of the World Cup will give this Six Nations an extra-special edge</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Romain Ntamack, France</h2> <p>At 19, he is the youngest player in the championship but deemed ready to make his transition to the senior setup, having steering France to the Junior World Cup title last summer. The son of the former France wing Emile, Ntamack has made 18 appearances for Toulouse this season, playing an instrumental role in their resurgence on the European stage. A fly-half by trade, Ntamack has made inside-centre his home for Toulouse this season but Jacques Brunel is keeping an open mind as to where he plays for France. \u201cIn matches Romain Ntamack starts as a centre but in open play he changes between positions. So we\u2019ll say he\u2019s a fly-half-centre,\u201d the head coach said. It may come later in the tournament but the first of what is likely to be many caps beckons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fdad1805761822ce1b141487f1b8d67effdcb62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fdad1805761822ce1b141487f1b8d67effdcb62/11_151_3070_1841/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Romain Ntamack \u2013 the youngest player in the tournament \u2013 in action for Toulouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Romain Ntamack \u2013 the youngest player in the tournament \u2013 in action for Toulouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Pavani/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Demba Bamba, France</h2> <p>Another promoted from France\u2019s Under-20s side, Bamba made his senior international debut against Fiji in the autumn.

      "bodyText": "Tom Curry, England Curry has five caps but has never before appeared in the Six Nations after missing out last year with a long-term wrist injury. He began the autumn in the No 7 jersey but was injured again in England\u2019s opening match and such was Sam Underhill\u2019s form thereafter that it is hard to imagine Curry would have come straight back in to the side but for the Bath flanker\u2019s similarly awful luck with injuries. Curry then is set for another chance to answer the ongoing question as to who is Eddie Jones\u2019s first-choice openside. The 20-year-old was one of the few shining lights of England\u2019s tour of South Africa last summer and has more in his attacking armoury than Underhill. He is an effective operator at the breakdown but if there is one concern about Curry it is that he struggles to adapt if on the wrong side of the officials. Romain Ntamack, France At 19, he is the youngest player in the championship but deemed ready to make his transition to the senior setup, having steering France to the Junior World Cup title last summer. The son of the former France wing Emile, Ntamack has made 18 appearances for Toulouse this season, playing an instrumental role in their resurgence on the European stage. A fly-half by trade, Ntamack has made inside-centre his home for Toulouse this season but Jacques Brunel is keeping an open mind as to where he plays for France. \u201cIn matches Romain Ntamack starts as a centre but in open play he changes between positions. So we\u2019ll say he\u2019s a fly-half-centre,\u201d the head coach said. It may come later in the tournament but the first of what is likely to be many caps beckons. Demba Bamba, France Another promoted from France\u2019s Under-20s side, Bamba made his senior international debut against Fiji in the autumn. Currently on loan at Brive from Lyon in France\u2019s second tier, Bamba is a ferocious scrummager, bulldozing carrier and fond of the odd offload as well. Like Ntamack, he was part of the French side that won the Under-20s Six Nations title but it was the Junior World Cup where he really caught the eye as part of a pack that scrummaged both New Zealand and England off the park in the semis and final respectively. Aged 14 Bamba was a national judo champion before making the transition to rugby where he began life as a No 8 before moving to tighthead prop, which explains his thunderous runs, for which is beginning to make a name for himself. Darcy Graham, Scotland A pocket rocket who earned a surprise call-up to the Scotland squad in the autumn on the back of some eye-catching displays for Edinburgh in the Champions Cup against Montpellier and Toulouse.

      "bodyText": "A 19-year-old man has been jailed for 11 years for killing four people including a toddler in a high-speed crash after a police chase through a built-up area of Sheffield. Elliott Bower was driving a stolen Volkswagen Golf when it collided at 79mph with a people carrier in a residential street in November. Adnan Ashraf Jarral, 35, his 16-month-old son, Muhammed Usman Bin Adnan, and the family\u2019s friends Vlasta Dunova, 41, and her husband, Miroslav Duna, 50, died in the crash. Jarral\u2019s wife, Erica Kroscenova, 32, Duna and Dunova\u2019s daughter Nikola Dunova, 22, and her three-year-old daughter, Livia Matova, were all seriously injured. Bower, described by the judge as a \u201cmiserably wretched local criminal\u201d, reached speeds of more than 100mph as he led police on a six-mile chase after taunting officers on social media with a picture captioned \u201cfuck da police\u201d. Bower and his brother, Declan, were wanted by police at the time for questioning in relation to serious offences including attempted murder. Richard Wright QC, prosecuting, said the pair, along with a third defendant, Mason Cartledge, now 18, were all engaged in a \u201cpro-criminal lifestyle\u201d and were \u201cresolved not to surrender to custody\u201d. The judge, Jeremy Richardson QC, said the driving was \u201cboth chilling and breathtaking in its horror\u201d and noted that none of the defendants had expressed any remorse. Passing sentencing at Doncaster crown court on Monday, he said: \u201cYou have visited a catastrophe of the highest magnitude on two families.\u201d Elliot Bower was jailed for 11 and a half years after he admitted four counts of causing death by dangerous driving and three charges of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Declan Bower and Cartledge were each sentenced to seven years and 10 months after they pleaded guilty to aggravated vehicle taking in which death was caused. Richardson said he would send his sentencing remarks to the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, who is conducting a review of sentencing in death by dangerous driving cases. The judge said it may be worth considering increasing the maximum sentence for the offence beyond the current 14 years for \u201cexceptional, serious\u201d cases involving multiple deaths. He said Elliott Bower would have been given 14 years if he had not pleaded guilty. In a victim impact statement, Kroscenova said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t deserve this and we lost loved ones. I lost my baby boy, who gave me strength and appetite for life every day. I miss his smile. I miss his voice. I never heard him calling me mummy; the only word he said was daddy.\u201d The Independent Office for Police Conduct launched an investigation after the crash due to the police pursuit. Richardson said \u201cnot a jot of blame\u201d for the crash should be attached to any of the police officers, whom he commended for driving with skill in \u201cextremely difficult circumstances\u201d. The court heart that while Elliot Bower was in police custody he claimed he had not been driving the vehicle and told an officer: \u201cI\u2019ll get out and bang, I\u2019ll do the same thing again and you will have to arrest me.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has taken the unusual measure of advising Americans not to kiss or snuggle their pet hedgehogs. It comes after a CDC investigation found that 11 people in the United States had contracted a rare strain of salmonella, known as Salmonella typhimurium, since October. It\u2019s emerged that 10 out of the 11 were in close contact with hedgehogs before becoming ill. The 11 people were in eight different states, including three in Missouri and two in Minnesota. The CDC said it was unclear if the pet hedgehogs came from \u201ca common supplier\u201d. Officials have warned hedgehog owners not to \u201ckiss or snuggle hedgehogs, because this can spread salmonella germs to your face and mouth and make you sick\u201d. Owners are also advised not to \u201clet hedgehogs roam freely in areas where food is prepared or stored, such as kitchen\u201d. One person has been hospitalised and no deaths have been reported. In 2012 there was another major outbreak of Salmonella typhimurium in which most people affected had come into contact with a hedgehog. During that outbreak there were a total of 26 cases and eight people were hospitalised. Some hedgehogs have become social media stars in the past few years, and their cute photos have racked up thousands of likes. Darcy the hedgehog, named after the former Smashing Pumpkins bassist D\u2019arcy Wretzky, has more than 294,000 followers. The humanisation of celebrity hedgehogs perhaps explains why people feel more compelled to kiss them, but having one as a pet remains illegal in many US states including Georgia, California and Hawaii, as well as Washington DC and New York City. These bans are mostly in place because of fears around disease.",

In March 2018, the UK information commissioner (ICO) ruled it would be illegal for the company to carry out a plan, paused in 2016, to share personal data between the two services in order to improve targeted advertising on Facebook. The ICO\u2019s investigation found \u201cWhatsApp has not identified a lawful basis of processing for any such sharing of personal data\u201d and that \u201cif they had shared the data, they would have been in contravention of the first and second data protection principles of the Data Protection Act\u201d. Following that ruling, WhatsApp entered a voluntary commitment that, if it did decide to share data, it would only do so in accordance with the requirements of GDPR, the pan-European data regulation, and working with the Irish data protection commissioner. Under GDPR, a company may designate one national regulator as its \u201clead supervisory authority\u201d, to prevent it having to deal with 28 separate regulators; for Facebook, Ireland\u2019s DPC takes that role. Facebook has not given a timescale on its plans to merge the three networks, but has confirmed it is \u201cconsidering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks\u201d.

Moments after being dumped out of the FA Cup by AFC Wimbledon on Saturday, there was surprise when they announced Marko Arnautovic had signed a contract extension after weeks of speculation over the forward leaving for China. There remains a chance Arnautovic will be allowed to leave in the summer for \u00a345m, but who can say with any certainty? His new contract has been extended for another year, which takes it until 2023, and I understand it\u2019s got some nice incentives. Arnautovic should return against Wolves tomorrow. Manuel Pellegrini, however, refused to take questions on him after the Wimbledon defeat.</p> <p>West Ham had lined up Celta Vigo\u2019s Maxi Gomez as a replacement for Arnautovic and had signalled a willingness to pay the striker\u2019s \u20ac50m release clause. They were even prepared to loan Gomez back to Spain until the rest of the season to let him help Celta battle against relegation from La Liga. Sounds like that\u2019s not happening this month, though. Perhaps one to revisit in the summer, but there might be a lot of competition for a highly-rated young forward then.</p> <p>As for other outgoings, West Ham are yet to receive a suitable bid for Javier Hernandez from Valencia. They want \u00a312m. The same applies to Reece Oxford, who\u2019s been linked with \u00a38m moves to Eintracht Frankfurt and Nottingham Forest. The messaging is there have been no bids for the young defender. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c4eef7de4b024f0efeb002a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-28T12:04:00.960Z\">12.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the subject of Tielemans to Leicester, we published this yesterday on the future of Leicester\u2019s Adrien Silva, who could end up in Monaco as half of a loan-swap deal:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/27/adrien-silva-leicester-city-premier-league-transfer-window\">Leicester midfielder Adrien Silva wants to leave before transfer deadline</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c4eec52e4b051f537969a68\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-28T11:50:11.229Z\">11.50am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s Andy Brassell\u2019s Bundesliga update:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jan/28/schalkes-fresh-bundesliga-start-stymied-after-bruising-trip-to-berlin\">Schalke\u2019s fresh Bundesliga start stymied after bruising trip to Berlin | Andy Brassell</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c4eeaf3e4b051f537969a5f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-28T11:46:32.913Z\">11.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Olivier Giroud has given an interview to Canal, recorded before the signing of Gonzalo Higuain was confirmed, in which he said that the Argentinian\u2019s arrival might push him out of Chelsea:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the club decides to get another striker, like Higuain, it will certainly darken my future at Chelsea.

For now we watch, we wait, and we hope for imminent excitement.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s just about it for today. Here are the key bits of news from a quiet day in the window. Things will surely heat up as Thursday approaches. Alvaro Morata has joined Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on an 18-month loan from Chelsea \u2026 \u2026 but Callum Hudson-Odoi seems set to stay at Chelsea until the end of the season. Unai Emery says Arsenal want to sign two players before Thursday\u2019s transfer deadline. Southampton are keen on Birmingham\u2019s Che Adams, while Charlie Austin could be leaving the club. Claude Puel says reports linking Leicester with Monaco\u2019s Youri Tielemans are \u201cfor the moment, just speculation\u201d. Not transfer-related but Neil Warnock has been speaking publicly today for the first time since it emerged that Emiliano Sala, Cardiff City\u2019s club-record signing, was on board a plane that disappeared near the Channel Islands last Monday: A bit of detail on Schalke\u2019s deal for Manchester City\u2019s Rabbi Matondo: the fee will be around \u00a312m, says our man in Manchester: There are a few whispers in France that Napoli full-back K\u00e9vin Malcuit is one of the two players Arsenal are looking to bring in before Thursday. Inter\u2019s Ivan Perisic has been widely flagged as the other player Emery is interested in. The Fiver is here! The Fiver is here! The Fiver is here! The Fiver is here! The Fiver is here! The Fiver is here! A bit of movement on the Callum Hudson-Odoi saga: More from Get French Football News \u2013 this time looking at Thierry Henry\u2019s miserable Monaco reign: Missed anything today? Here\u2019s a handy guide to the notable news: Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl has confirmed that Charlie Austin could be heading out of St Mary\u2019s this week. \u201cI think we have a lot of options for two positions, so it can be a possibility that he\u2019s leaving,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if not then I\u2019m happy that he\u2019s here and helps us to chase our targets that we have. \u201cI think it\u2019s sometimes the point that you as a club can\u2019t give any player what he expects us to give him. So, in this situation we are trying to find a win-win situation for both sides. He\u2019s a fantastic striker, a striker who can score for every team I think.\u201d The good folk at Get French Football News have sent us this update: \u201cAdrien Rabiot has turned Tottenham Hotspur down, despite conversations with manager Mauricio Pochettino at the beginning of last week, per L\u2019\u00c9quipe reporting. Spurs wanted to sign the player this month &amp; were willing to offer him \u20ac7.5m a year. \u201cPSG will come back with another bid for Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye before Thursday\u2019s deadline, according to RMC. Les Parisiens are looking for ways to structure a deal financially that works in relation to FFP and is worth more to Everton. \u201cSources confirm to Get French Football News that AS Monaco are open to the loan departure of Youri Tielemans this month. The Belgian international, who was exceptionally close to departed manager Thierry Henry, appears to be the first temporary casualty of Leonardo Jardim\u2019s return. \u201cWatford are expected to return with a formal proposal for Bordeaux attacker Fran\u00e7ois Kamano before the month is up.\u201d Another done deal: Cardiff\u2019s Omar Bogle has joined League One promotion chasers Portsmouth on loan: Chelsea will be picking up a sizeable loan fee, of course, in an attempt to offset that \u00a360m outlay, but given the size of the fee (his move to Stamford Bridge remains one of the top 25 most expensive transfers of all time) and the lack of impact, is Morata in the conversation when it comes to history\u2019s biggest transfer flops? Here\u2019s Atleti\u2019s view: \u201cWith Morata\u2019s arrival, we add a very talented striker to our club, who has the ability to score with his feet and his head thanks to his height (189 cm) and to combine with his teammates.\u201d A few Chelsea fans might question that claim \u2013 24 goals in 72 appearances isn\u2019t much of a return for a striker who cost around \u00a360m when he joined in the summer of 2017. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid have confirmed that Chelsea\u2019s Alvaro Morata is joining them on an 18-month loan: Sky Sports are reporting that West Ham are also in for Sheffield United\u2019s John Fleck. Claude Puel has said that talk of a Leicester move for Monaco midfielder Youri Tielemans is \u201cjust speculation\u201d, with Adrien Silva, the player who has been mooted as heading the other way in a loan-swap, set to play a more important role for the club as the season progresses: \u201cFor the moment it is just speculation. He is a good player. He [Tielemans] has got good attributes but I have Adrien [Silva]. \u201cWe have a squad with some players with a desire for more game time. I am happy about Adrien because he can give other possibilities for the team. He offers different qualities to Hamza Choudhary, Nampalys Mendy or Wilfred Ndidi. \u201cSometimes we can play with three midfielders and I think there will be an opportunity for Adrien to have game time in the second half of the season.\u201d Perhaps the key words from Puel there are \u201cfor the moment\u201d. Huddersfield manager Jan Siewert was coy on his transfer targets earlier but one of those apparently in the Terriers\u2019 sights is Charlton\u2019s Karlan Grant. The Addicks manager Lee Bowyer has told the South London Press that it will be tough to hold on to the striker: \u201cAll I can say is he is still our player and we\u2019re fighting hard to keep hold of him. I can\u2019t really say much more, that is how it is. Sometimes it is out of our hands. It\u2019s going to be difficult.\u201d An email: \u201cWith Rabbi Matondo joining Sancho and possibly Hudson-Odoi in securing a move away from the Premier League in search of opportunities, would this not be an ideal time for the Premier League to start discussing an increase in squad quotas for home grown talent?\u201d wonders Sam Jones. It might well be but the Premier League came out against any increase just two months ago: Unai Emery says Arsenal are looking to make two signings before Thursday\u2019s deadline. \u201cThis transfer window is not easy and the message is the club is working on different players and the possibility if it can be is good for us,\u201d Emery said. \u201cWe are looking at two different players and the possibility they can come.\u201d Just to return to West Ham again, Italian journalist Alfredo Pedulla reckons the Hammers are in for Benfica\u2019s Mesaque Dju. West Ham\u2019s Manuel Pellegrini has been speaking about the Marko Arnautovic saga. \u201cMarko has already demonstrated what he can do, he made an important difference, I hope that from now until the end of the season he will do it again,\u201d said the Hammers manager. \u201cHis long-term future? We can talk at the end of the season about that, now our mind must be concentrated on Wolverhampton.\u201d Sounds like Galatasaray are still trying to get some deals over the line \u2026 Rafael Benitez has given what sounds like a not-particularly-enlightening press conference ahead of Newcastle\u2019s game against Manchester City on Tuesday night. Here\u2019s a chunk from the Press Association: Asked at his pre-match press conference on Monday if the club was still active in the market, he replied: \u201cYes.\u201d However, asked if he was hopeful that they will make progress, he replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Hello all. I\u2019ll kick off with the news that Ezequiel Schelotto is leaving Brighton for Chievo until the end of the season. The full-back previously played for Chievo back in 2014-15 and was a fairly regular presence in the Albion side last season but has slipped down the pecking order in this campaign. \u201cWe have strong competition in the full-back areas and this move gives him the chance to play regularly in Italy\u2019s top division, which is a league he knows well,\u201d said Brighton manager Chris Hughton. \u201cWe wish him all the very best for the remainder of this campaign.\u201d And with that, I\u2019ll hand over to John Ashdown for the afternoon - email him on john.ashdown@theguardian.com or tweet: @John_Ashdown Manuel Pellegrini has said that players returning from injury for West Ham means he does not need to make signings. \u201cWe have injured players coming back and they will help us in some positions. We have Ryan Fredericks back and Manuel Lanzini can be available in three weeks or one month more and he is a very important player. The other players I cannot say exactly when they will be back, but it will not be less than one month.\u201d Fulham\u2019s Claudio Ranieri says he would welcome Aboubakar Kamara back to the club but has confirmed the forward is still suspended after being arrested on suspicion of actual bodily harm. \u201c\u201cIf he comes back then for me it\u2019s no problem, for the team it\u2019s no problem. Everyone is working well,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cHe is still suspended from the club and we are waiting.\u201d Ed Aarons has an update on the Hudson-Odoi situation at Chelsea: Meanwhile, here\u2019s the latest from Sid Lowe: Montilivi, not Miami, hosts Girona v Barcelona as Tebas loses his bet Antonio R\u00fcdiger has told Chelsea to make sure Callum Hudson-Odoi does not leave. The winger refused to discuss a potential move to Bayern Munich after scoring his side\u2019s second goal against Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup on Tuesday night but Chelsea fans sang that they wanted him to stay, \u201cWhat I can say is clear, Chelsea have to make him stay. It will be a pity if this young talent leaves us. Chelsea need to give him a new contract. He\u2019s a quality player. You can see how he dribbles, how he goes one against one, he can be good for us.\u201d Hudson-Odoi\u2019s six starts for Chelsea have come in cup competitions and the Europa League. He has a total of five substitute appearances for the club this season and two goals and is yet to start in the Premier League. Chelsea play at Bournemouth in the Premier League on Wednesday, with the transfer window closing a day later. Done deal! Blackpool\u2019s Mark Cullen has joined Carlisle United on loan! The Telegraph are reporting that Manchester City have agreed to sell the 18-year-old Welsh international Rabbi Matondo to Schalke for \u20ac13m. Borussia Monchengladbach, RB Leipzig, Hoffenheim and Milan were also interested in the player, who appears set to become the latest young British starlet to relocate to Germany. Meanwhile the Huddersfield manager, Jan Siewert, has given a non-committal answer to questions about his chances of adding to the squad: I\u2019m in constant communication with the recruitment team. We will see what happens over the next three days. One player who Chelsea might allow to leave this month: Here\u2019s Marco Silva on Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s offer for Idrissa Gueye, rumoured at around \u00a321m: My reaction is the same of the reaction of the club. We reject the offer. He\u2019s a really important player for us. For me, in my opinion, since the first day we started speaking about this possible interest in him, from a technical point of view he\u2019s a very important player for us and he\u2019s not a player we want to lose in this market. After [this season] it\u2019s a matter of money. Marco Silva has given a press conference at Everton, as he prepares to visit Huddersfield tomorrow with his side having lost six of their last nine games in all competitions. It\u2019s not strictly speaking transfer-related, though perhaps panicking would involve throwing some money about: In October, November, when we were playing well and doing what is our obligation as club, I told you many, many things we had to improve. I am not happy with the last month and a half, but I am not panicking. We as a club cannot panic. Even if we are not happy, even if the fans are disappointed. I am also, but I am not panicking because we as a club cannot panic if we want to do the right things in the future. Paolo Bandini\u2019s Serie A round-up has landed: Done deal: Roy Keane\u2019s return to Nottingham Forest has been confirmed! And here\u2019s something from Tom Dart in Glendale about a new chapter for the USA national team: Here\u2019s an update on Fifa\u2019s investigation into Chelsea\u2019s transfer dealings from David Hytner, with the governing body \u201cnow considering its final decision\u201d on the long-running affair: The Mail is reporting that Everton have made Cenk Tosun available for transfer, and will \u201clisten to offers of \u00a320m\u201d for the Turkish striker. He arrived from Besiktas a year ago for \u00a325m. They will not, however, be accepting any similar-sized offers for Idrissa Gueye, for whom Paris Saint-Germain are said to have bid \u00a321.5m. This just in from Jacob Steinberg: It\u2019s been a strange few days at West Ham. Moments after being dumped out of the FA Cup by AFC Wimbledon on Saturday, there was surprise when they announced Marko Arnautovic had signed a contract extension after weeks of speculation over the forward leaving for China. There remains a chance Arnautovic will be allowed to leave in the summer for \u00a345m, but who can say with any certainty? His new contract has been extended for another year, which takes it until 2023, and I understand it\u2019s got some nice incentives. Arnautovic should return against Wolves tomorrow. Manuel Pellegrini, however, refused to take questions on him after the Wimbledon defeat. West Ham had lined up Celta Vigo\u2019s Maxi Gomez as a replacement for Arnautovic and had signalled a willingness to pay the striker\u2019s \u20ac50m release clause. They were even prepared to loan Gomez back to Spain until the rest of the season to let him help Celta battle against relegation from La Liga. Sounds like that\u2019s not happening this month, though. Perhaps one to revisit in the summer, but there might be a lot of competition for a highly-rated young forward then. As for other outgoings, West Ham are yet to receive a suitable bid for Javier Hernandez from Valencia. They want \u00a312m. The same applies to Reece Oxford, who\u2019s been linked with \u00a38m moves to Eintracht Frankfurt and Nottingham Forest. The messaging is there have been no bids for the young defender. On the subject of Tielemans to Leicester, we published this yesterday on the future of Leicester\u2019s Adrien Silva, who could end up in Monaco as half of a loan-swap deal: Here\u2019s Andy Brassell\u2019s Bundesliga update: Olivier Giroud has given an interview to Canal, recorded before the signing of Gonzalo Higuain was confirmed, in which he said that the Argentinian\u2019s arrival might push him out of Chelsea: If the club decides to get another striker, like Higuain, it will certainly darken my future at Chelsea. I have never said no to a return to France. Lyon and Marseille are two great clubs. My priority is to stay in the Premier League though. Here\u2019s the interview (in French): Talking of Birmingham strikers, as we were a while ago, Southampton have apparently opened talks over a deal for Che Adams, who has scored 14 goals in 28 league games this season. The Saints are prepared to sell Charlie Austin, with Stoke interested. And some more talking points from yesterday\u2019s WSL games: While we wait for transfers, here are some talking points from the weekend\u2019s FA Cup fixtures: Full details of that and every other transfer worth knowing about can be found here: One deal has been done today: Wu Lei has joined Espanyol, owned by the Chinese Rastar Group, from Shanghai SIPG. His goalscoring record in China is excellent, but he\u2019s currently injured and is unlikely to play for a couple of months at least. The Mirror are reporting this morning (as the Sun and the Mail did over the weekend) that both Liverpool and Manchester United are interested in the 16-year-Birmingham City striker Romello Mitchell. He\u2019s been linked with a move before, with these new stories apparently prompted by the fact he has just turned 16. While the Telegraph\u2019s John Percy is suggesting that Leicester and Monaco will swap midfielders, both on loan: According to the Belgian journalist Kristof Terreur, Monaco are open to loaning Tielemans for the remainder of the season. The big news this morning is that Leicester have, according to multiple reports, decided they need to strengthen in central midfield and have thus tabled a \u00a320m bid for Monaco\u2019s Youri Tielemans, the 21-year-old Belgian. He is apparently keen on a move to England, and his signing would be a real coup for the Foxes. Here\u2019s an update from Sky\u2019s Adam Leventhal, who has impeccable Vicarage Road-based sources. The prospect of a Hornet called Cornet looks unlikely to become reality, sadly. Tick, tock says the big transfer clock. Time is running out, with the Premier League\u2019s transfer guillotine set to fall at 11pm GMT on Thursday. The way the month has gone so far, either most of the significant action is going to be compressed into the final few hours and days, or there isn\u2019t going to be any significant action at all. For now we watch, we wait, and we hope for imminent excitement. Here are today\u2019s key rumours:",

The leftist leader said the standard monthly minimum wage would rise by 11%, from \u20ac586 (\u00a3509) to \u20ac650, and a lower-wage category for younger employees would be abolished. \u201c[This] will be emblematic for the labour force, a rise that will reinvigorate the real economy,\u201d Tsipras told a meeting of his cabinet.

The increase, while expected, was greater than anticipated: there had been speculation that it would rise by 8% to \u20ac630. Tsipras, who faces general elections later this year and is lagging in polls, is determined to reverse some of the unpopular measures Athens has been compelled to take by the creditors behind the bailouts that have kept Greece afloat for the past nine years. After receiving the biggest financial rescue in global economic history, the country exited its third and final EU-sponsored bailout programme last August. The planned wage increases were agreed in consultation with EU lenders still monitoring Athens\u2019 fiscal progress and must be approved by parliament to take effect in February as the government hopes. An estimated 880,000 people will benefit from the changes, according to the labour ministry, which said unemployment pay and maternity support would also rise.

The shutdown triggered by a fight over funding for Donald Trump\u2019s proposed border wall with Mexico ended on Friday and was the longest in US history. According to the CBO, the shutdown hurt economic growth because it affected roughly 800,000 workers and delayed federal spending on goods and services. Much of the money will be recouped now the government is open again but the CBO calculates $3bn will never be recovered and the full impact of the closure \u2013 which left hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors without pay \u2013 may be larger. The CBO warned \u201call of the estimated effects and their timing are subject to considerable uncertainty\u201d.

That\u2019s quite a big challenge. There\u2019s no negotiation between the UK and EU \u2013 that\u2019s finished.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point beating about the bush \u2013 the agreement was defeated with a two-thirds majority in the House of Commons. That\u2019s a crushing defeat by any standards. It\u2019s quite a challenge to see how you can construct out of the diversity of opposition a positive majority for a deal.\u201d</p> <p>Weyand said of the two years of talks due to end on 29 March: \u201cThere\u2019s a very high risk of a crash out not by design, but by accident. Perhaps by the design of article 50, but not by policymakers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe think we can handle it,\u201d Weyand said. \u201cI\u2019m less sure about UK side. For us it\u2019s about EU-UK trade relationship and disruption to supply chains. For the UK a no deal would mean that a part of the regulatory and supervisory structure of economy breaks away \u2013 a much bigger challenge.\u201d</p> <p>In an apparent sign of the frustration in Brussels at May\u2019s handling of the negotiations, the German EU official also contrasted the transparency in Brussels on their goals to the approach taken by Downing Street.</p> <p>Speaking at a thinktank event in Brussels, she said: \u201cYou cannot lead a negotiation like that in secrecy. We\u2019ve seen on UK side the fact this was handled in a very small circle and that there was no information about all the things that were tried in the negotiations is now a big handicap.\u201d</p> <p>The prime minister is set to return to Brussels in the coming days but Michel Barnier\u2019s deputy offered little succour to those in London hoping for a renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement containing the backstop, an arrangement under which the whole of the UK could stay in a customs union in order to avoid a hard border.</p> <p>The amendment tabled by Brady, the chair of the backbench 1922 Committee of Tory MPs, commits MPs to backing the withdrawal agreement should the prime minister secure a replacement of some sort for the backstop.</p> <p>But some Brexiters have said they will only vote for the withdrawal agreement if the Irish backstop is replaced with a simple statement of intent over avoiding a hard border.</p> <p>Other MPs, including Brady, are in favour of drafting a separate legal document detailing how the UK might in certain circumstances extract itself from the customs union envisaged in the backstop.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to reopen the agreement,\u201d Weyand said at the European Policy Centre event. \u201cThe result of the negotiation has been very much shaped by the UK negotiators, much more than they actually get credit for. This is a bit like snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. The backstop was very much shaped by UK.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like Groundhog Day,\u201d Weyand added of others in Westminster calling for a time limit or unilateral exit clause in the backstop. \u201cNone of this is new. This has been extensively discussed at the negotiating table amongst the EU27. EU27 were unanimous a time limit to the backstop defeats the purpose of the backstop.\u201d</p> <p>Of the suggestion that there was a technological solution for avoiding a hard border, Weyand said: \u201cWe looked at every border on this earth, every border EU has with a third country \u2013 there\u2019s simply no way you can do away with checks and controls.</p> <p>\u201cThe negotiators have not been able to explain them to us and that\u2019s not their fault; it\u2019s because they don\u2019t exist.\u201d</p> <p>She added that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the UK and Irish governments would \u201close the one operational solution to the Irish border conundrum but we\u2019d be stuck with the same scenario\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSo you could imagine a no-deal scenario with the backstop being discussed,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Weyand further warned that the debate in Westminster, in which discussions over the rival strengths and weaknesses of Norway and Canada\u2019s relationship to the bloc have recently dominated, appeared at times to be \u201cuninhibited by any knowledge of what is actually in the withdrawal agreement\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOur impression is discussion is much more about the future of the country and the future of the UK-EU relationship than about the content of the withdrawal agreement,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A separate amendment due to be voted on, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/28/labour-support-for-yvette-coopers-brexit-amendment-in-doubt\">tabled by the Labour MP Yvette Cooper</a>, would force the prime minister to delay Brexit beyond 29 March should she have failed to ratify a deal by the end of February.</p> <p>Weyand said the EU\u2019s heads of state and government would need information on \u201cthe purpose of an extension\u201d. \u201cThe idea of going into serial extensions really isn\u2019t very popular in the EU27,\u201d she added.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The risk of accidentally crashing out of the EU without a deal has been described as \u201cvery high\u201d by a key EU architect of the Brexit deal, with parliamentary backing for changes to the backstop likely to be met with a brick wall in Brussels. Senior Conservative MPs are seeking to form a majority in a Commons vote on Tuesday calling for Theresa May to demand an alternative plan to the Irish backstop for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. But on Monday, EU officials and diplomats said the amendment tabled by the Tory MP Graham Brady, and backed by Downing Street, failed to offer any clue as to what alternative arrangement parliament could support. With the votes on Tuesday unlikely to offer any clarity on what MPs can unite behind, the EU\u2019s deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand, offered a sober analysis of the chances of a deal being ratified in Westminster. She said: \u201cWe need to have a majority that doesn\u2019t just get agreement over hurdle of a meaningful vote by a narrow majority but we need to have a stable majority to ensure the ratification. That\u2019s quite a big challenge. There\u2019s no negotiation between the UK and EU \u2013 that\u2019s finished. \u201cThere\u2019s no point beating about the bush \u2013 the agreement was defeated with a two-thirds majority in the House of Commons. That\u2019s a crushing defeat by any standards. It\u2019s quite a challenge to see how you can construct out of the diversity of opposition a positive majority for a deal.\u201d Weyand said of the two years of talks due to end on 29 March: \u201cThere\u2019s a very high risk of a crash out not by design, but by accident. Perhaps by the design of article 50, but not by policymakers.\u201d \u201cWe think we can handle it,\u201d Weyand said. \u201cI\u2019m less sure about UK side. For us it\u2019s about EU-UK trade relationship and disruption to supply chains. For the UK a no deal would mean that a part of the regulatory and supervisory structure of economy breaks away \u2013 a much bigger challenge.\u201d In an apparent sign of the frustration in Brussels at May\u2019s handling of the negotiations, the German EU official also contrasted the transparency in Brussels on their goals to the approach taken by Downing Street. Speaking at a thinktank event in Brussels, she said: \u201cYou cannot lead a negotiation like that in secrecy. We\u2019ve seen on UK side the fact this was handled in a very small circle and that there was no information about all the things that were tried in the negotiations is now a big handicap.\u201d The prime minister is set to return to Brussels in the coming days but Michel Barnier\u2019s deputy offered little succour to those in London hoping for a renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement containing the backstop, an arrangement under which the whole of the UK could stay in a customs union in order to avoid a hard border. The amendment tabled by Brady, the chair of the backbench 1922 Committee of Tory MPs, commits MPs to backing the withdrawal agreement should the prime minister secure a replacement of some sort for the backstop. But some Brexiters have said they will only vote for the withdrawal agreement if the Irish backstop is replaced with a simple statement of intent over avoiding a hard border. Other MPs, including Brady, are in favour of drafting a separate legal document detailing how the UK might in certain circumstances extract itself from the customs union envisaged in the backstop. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to reopen the agreement,\u201d Weyand said at the European Policy Centre event. \u201cThe result of the negotiation has been very much shaped by the UK negotiators, much more than they actually get credit for. This is a bit like snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. The backstop was very much shaped by UK.\u201d \u201cIt feels like Groundhog Day,\u201d Weyand added of others in Westminster calling for a time limit or unilateral exit clause in the backstop. \u201cNone of this is new. This has been extensively discussed at the negotiating table amongst the EU27. EU27 were unanimous a time limit to the backstop defeats the purpose of the backstop.\u201d Of the suggestion that there was a technological solution for avoiding a hard border, Weyand said: \u201cWe looked at every border on this earth, every border EU has with a third country \u2013 there\u2019s simply no way you can do away with checks and controls. \u201cThe negotiators have not been able to explain them to us and that\u2019s not their fault; it\u2019s because they don\u2019t exist.\u201d She added that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the UK and Irish governments would \u201close the one operational solution to the Irish border conundrum but we\u2019d be stuck with the same scenario\u201d. \u201cSo you could imagine a no-deal scenario with the backstop being discussed,\u201d she said. Weyand further warned that the debate in Westminster, in which discussions over the rival strengths and weaknesses of Norway and Canada\u2019s relationship to the bloc have recently dominated, appeared at times to be \u201cuninhibited by any knowledge of what is actually in the withdrawal agreement\u201d. \u201cOur impression is discussion is much more about the future of the country and the future of the UK-EU relationship than about the content of the withdrawal agreement,\u201d she said. A separate amendment due to be voted on, tabled by the Labour MP Yvette Cooper, would force the prime minister to delay Brexit beyond 29 March should she have failed to ratify a deal by the end of February. Weyand said the EU\u2019s heads of state and government would need information on \u201cthe purpose of an extension\u201d. \u201cThe idea of going into serial extensions really isn\u2019t very popular in the EU27,\u201d she added.",

      "bodyText": "Earlier today I set you the following three problems. Solution: 64 If we call the \u2018size\u2019 of a triangle the number of individual areas it contains, there are 7 triangles of size 1 14 triangles of size 2 10 triangles of size 3 13 triangles of size 4 6 triangles of size 6 6 triangles of size 8 3 triangles of size 9 4 triangles of size 12 1 triangle of size 16 Add them up at that makes 64 triangles in total. Solution: 25 per cent (or 1/4) Every ant can move in two possible directions, which makes 2\u00b3 = 8 possible sets of outcomes, all of which are equally likely. Only two of the outcomes have no collisions: when all ants are moving clockwise or anticlockwise. This means the probability is 2/8 = 1/4, or a 25 per cent chance. Solution: The statements \u2018It is divisible by 16\u2019 and \u2018It is divisible by 17\u2019 Let N be the large integer that is the subject of the question. We are looking for the two incorrect statements, which we are told are consecutive. The first statement, that N is divisible by 1, must be true because every whole number is divisible by 1. The second statement, that N is divisible by 2, must also be true because if it was false, then all the even numbered statements would also be false, since N would not be divisible by 4, 6, 8 and so on, which would mean there are 15 incorrect statements, contradicting the premise. Using the same argument, the first 15 statements must also all be true. If N were not divisible by x, where x is between 1 to 15, then N would not be divisible by 2x, so you would have at least two incorrect but nonconsecutive statements. We conclude that the two incorrect statements must concern the numbers between 16 and 30. We know that N is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 15. We can express these numbers in terms of their prime factors: 2 3 2 x 2 5 2 x 3 7 2 x 2 x 2 3 x 3 2 x 5 11 2 x 2 x 3 13 2 x 7 3 x 5 N must also be divisible by the lowest common multiple of all these numbers, which is 2\u00b3 \u00d7 3\u00b2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 11 x 13 = 360,360. (8 gives us three copies of 2, and 9 gives us two copies of 3.) This number is divisible by 18 (= 2 \u00d7 3\u00b2), 20 (= 2\u00b2 \u00d7 5), 21 (= 3 \u00d7 7), 22, 24, 26, 28 and 30, so N is also divisible by these numbers. We are left with just seven possibilities for incorrect factors: The prime numbers 17, 19, 23 and 29 The powers 16 = 2\u2074, 25 = 5\u00b2 and 27 = 3\u00b3. Each of these powers contains more copies of the respective prime factors than in the prime factorisation above. Of these candidates, there is just one pair of consecutive numbers: 16 and 17.

      "bodyText": "Recycling is being stockpiled and council authorities fear it will soon head to landfill, as Australia\u2019s recycling crisis continues to take its toll on the industry. More than a year after China refused to accept 99% of the world\u2019s recycling, halting the export of more than one million tonnes of Australian waste each year, the heads of local government warn the recycling market is still in trouble. On 1 January 2018, China\u2019s National Sword policy forced Australia to rethink its decade-long reliance on exporting thousands of tonnes of plastic, paper and cardboard. While the obvious solution would be to better develop the domestic recycling industry, councils say a lack of funding, coupled with rock-bottom recycling prices, is hampering efforts to build better infrastructure and reinvigorate a dying market. A system still in crisis \u201cNew South Wales urgently needs a big investment of funding from the waste levy to begin the process of growing a domestic recycling industry,\u201d says the local government NSW president, Linda Scott. \u201cThere are a number of councils that are having to stockpile materials that can be recycled so that it doesn\u2019t get sent to landfill,\u201d Scott says. \u201cIn the face of the China [national] sword decision, recycling in NSW is at risk and will begin to falter.\u201d While council associations and industry claim recycling is yet to spill into landfill, local government authority heads across the nation are all calling for funding injections to deal with the crisis. \u201cYou can only recycle something or a product if there is a market for it. If there is no market for it, then of course you have to send it to landfill,\u201d says Tony Khoury, the executive director of the waste contractors and recyclers association of NSW. China\u2019s new 0.5% contamination threshold for recycling caused a glut of plastics and other recyclables in Australia as the nation\u2019s facilities, which were already poor at sorting material, failed to meet the new standard. The resulting sudden surplus, combined with limited domestic market capability, crashed the value of discarded plastic and paper. According to a sustainable packing industry report, mixed paper scrap plummeted from $124/tonne to $0/tonne, plunging councils into war with commercial operators whose product was suddenly worthless. In April, Queensland\u2019s Ipswich council threatened to send recycling to landfill, claiming that its recycling costs had quintupled to well over $2m in the wake of China\u2019s new policy. Last week the ACT government ordered 250 tonnes of recyclables to be dumped in landfill after the forced shutdown of a Hume recycling processing centre because of safety concerns. In 2017, it was revealed that waste recycling companies were stockpiling glass after the cost of creating bottles in Australia became more expensive than importing the product from overseas. But stockpiling paper and plastic is a much more dangerous game. In July last year, stockpiled recycling bales in suburban Melbourne caught fire, causing evacuations and prompting inspections that uncovered more stockpiles across Victoria, according to Victoria\u2019s environment protection authority . \u201cUrgent action is needed as ministers themselves have acknowledged,\u201d says the Australian local government association president, mayor David O\u2019Loughlin. While the NSW environment minister, Gabrielle Upton, did not answer specific questions about investing more of the state\u2019s waste levy into recycling, her office issued a statement saying the state government diverted $47m to help industry respond to China\u2019s new policy in March last year. \u201cThe NSW government has taken the lead by establishing an intergovernmental taskforce to progress a longer term strategic response to National Sword, in partnership with industry and local councils,\u201d the statement, attributed to the NSW EPA, said. \u201cWaste Less, Recycle More is funded through the waste levy and is Australia\u2019s largest waste and recycling funding program.\u201d In February, Victoria provided $13m to councils to help fund recycling until rates can rise in June. The government also injected $24m to improve processes. In Tasmania, the chief executive officer of the Local Government Association, Dion Lester, says they have requested financial support from the state government to lessen the burden of the increased costs on the Tasmanian community. \u201cHowever, unlike most mainland jurisdictions, the Tasmanian government has not made any resources available,\u201d Lester says. So where does it go? Recycling management has always been funded by levies and state and territory grants. But what exactly happens to Australia\u2019s discarded plastic, paper, card, metal and glass once it\u2019s emptied from yellow bins depends on the postcode. Some councils contract waste disposal to private operators, called material recovery facilities (MRFs), while others run their own processing facilities and re-sale/collection shops. Some states, such as Western Australia, have been sending almost all their recyclables to south-east Asian countries including Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam. Shifting the waste crisis elsewhere is a temporary solution already posing problems, with Malaysia banning plastic waste importing in October last year. In Victoria, the chief executive officer of the Victorian Local Governance Association, Kathryn Arndt, labelled the current model of exporting waste overseas flawed and unsustainable. \u201cPerth has managed to avoid the eastern states catastrophe of no markets, nowhere to go. And with that said, Perth is focusing on local reprocessing capacity,\u201d says the Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association of Australia WA president, Adam Johnson. \u201cThe thing that will resolve the issue is support from the state government.\u201d Johnson says on the east coast, recycling is being stockpiled while people are \u201cfrantically\u201d working out how to move materials. High-quality recycling in South Australia has allowed some recycling to still be sent to China. Khoury says the first thing that followed China\u2019s National Sword policy was that recyclers needed more money to clean up products, leading to stand-offs between councils and processers. \u201cSo there have been many, many negotiations in the past 12 months and many of them haven\u2019t been finalised,\u201d Khoury says. \u201cThere needs to be more input from the state and territory governments because they are the ones that collected the tax.\u201d \u2018As much backbone as in the average plastic shopping bag\u2019 In December, Australia\u2019s environment ministers agreed to a new national waste policy, which O\u2019Loughlin says is full of good intentions but has \u201cas much backbone as you\u2019ll find in the average plastic shopping bag\u201d. The federal environment minister, Melissa Price, would not answer specific questions on the recycling crisis but instead issued a blanket statement that said: \u201cThe plan will include a coordinated approach to waste levies. It will also address waste management priorities including plastic pollution, support for industry development, increasing demand for recycled materials, and national approaches to waste policy and regulation, for example in regard to cross-border transportation of waste.\u201d Price said the government is considering converting power stations to burn plastic waste and create energy.",

A study published in 2017 of 817 Australian nursing homes found the average spend was $6.08 per person per day. In comparison, the Australian prison system was spending on average $8.25 on food per prisoner per day. Food quality is likely to be an issue examined in the royal commission into aged care quality and safety, which was established in response to damning incidents of neglect, abuse and negligence in nursing homes across the country. Celebrity cook Maggie Beer has been on a mission to improve the quality of food in nursing homes after being named 2010 senior Australian of the year.

Many parts of south-east Queensland are on track for the driest January on record, and no significant rainfall is forecast.</p> \n<p>Brisbane is not drought-declared, and household water restrictions are not considered necessary. But the city\u2019s ecosystems, located in generous environmental corridors and parklands that twist through the suburbs along creek catchments, are showing signs of strain.</p> \n<p>\u201cFrom my point of view, it\u2019s grim,\u201d says Leo Lee, a former president of Save Our Waterways Now, who has lived along the Enoggera Creek catchment (Enoggera Creek becomes Breakfast Creek before it joins the Brisbane River) for more than 60 years.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt has been drier. When we had that drought up to about 2009, in that period it got a lot drier. But at the moment we\u2019re desperately in need of [heavy rainfall].\u201d<br><br>Lee estimates the native fish stocks in the catchment are about 5% of those when he was a child. The loss, he says, is mainly due to environmental factors, pollution and disease.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b3c3686c3d21bd5f06828896bfdac33841edf28\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b3c3686c3d21bd5f06828896bfdac33841edf28/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Many locals stop to watch the turtles and the families of ducks in Breakfast Creek at Kelvin Grove\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many locals stop to watch the turtles and the families of ducks in Breakfast Creek at Kelvin Grove.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Smee/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He said native species were equipped to handle the variable \u201cflash flows\u201d of waterways on Brisbane\u2019s northside. But he said extreme conditions \u2013 even in creeks that historically run dry during prolonged periods without rain \u2013 could compound other factors and cause local extinctions.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe populations have dwindled so that if you do get something like a drought it becomes a critical environmental factor,\u201d Lee said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the numbers of organisms that have been in the creek before.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lee also raised concern that a manmade weir, a few hundred metres from the turtle bridge, at Bennett Park in Kelvin Grove, had stopped the tidal ebb and flow in much of the catchment.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll those turtles and all those things would not be [stuck] there if it was a tidally influenced creek,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThe fish that migrate up and down the creek are mostly blocked by that weir. If that weir wasn\u2019t down the end, they would be dispersed throughout the catchment. Now they\u2019re all gathering down that one end where the pool is.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8e1ef7c8-427e-4a87-a70d-97a19395e476\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>, Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910, and temperatures will increase in the future.</p>\n    <p>So how will climate change affect future heatwaves in Australia?</p>\n    <p>The CSIRO and BoM have compiled different models for predicting the outcome of climate change in Australia <a href=\"https://www.climatechangeinaustralia.gov.au/en/\">to produce a guide to how different regions will likely be affected</a>.</p>\n    <p>They found that every part of Australia will continue to experience increases in average temperature, and will have a higher frequency of hot days.<br></p>\n    <p>The duration of hot spells will increase in every region.

      "bodyText": "The locals call this spot the \u201cturtle bridge\u201d, and most stop for a few moments to watch the turtles and the families of ducks. Lately they\u2019ve been muttering about the sprawl of the dry creek bed, which has turned the section of Brisbane\u2019s Breakfast Creek into a shallow stagnant pond, shrinking by the day. \u201cIt\u2019s drier than I can remember,\u201d one long-term Kelvin Grove resident says, before walking on. \u201cThe water just looks awful,\u201d says another. \u201cWe had better get some rain soon.\u201d The forecast is not promising. Many parts of south-east Queensland are on track for the driest January on record, and no significant rainfall is forecast. Brisbane is not drought-declared, and household water restrictions are not considered necessary. But the city\u2019s ecosystems, located in generous environmental corridors and parklands that twist through the suburbs along creek catchments, are showing signs of strain. \u201cFrom my point of view, it\u2019s grim,\u201d says Leo Lee, a former president of Save Our Waterways Now, who has lived along the Enoggera Creek catchment (Enoggera Creek becomes Breakfast Creek before it joins the Brisbane River) for more than 60 years. \u201cIt has been drier. When we had that drought up to about 2009, in that period it got a lot drier. But at the moment we\u2019re desperately in need of [heavy rainfall].\u201d Lee estimates the native fish stocks in the catchment are about 5% of those when he was a child. The loss, he says, is mainly due to environmental factors, pollution and disease. He said native species were equipped to handle the variable \u201cflash flows\u201d of waterways on Brisbane\u2019s northside. But he said extreme conditions \u2013 even in creeks that historically run dry during prolonged periods without rain \u2013 could compound other factors and cause local extinctions. \u201cThe populations have dwindled so that if you do get something like a drought it becomes a critical environmental factor,\u201d Lee said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the numbers of organisms that have been in the creek before.\u201d Lee also raised concern that a manmade weir, a few hundred metres from the turtle bridge, at Bennett Park in Kelvin Grove, had stopped the tidal ebb and flow in much of the catchment. \u201cAll those turtles and all those things would not be [stuck] there if it was a tidally influenced creek,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThe fish that migrate up and down the creek are mostly blocked by that weir. If that weir wasn\u2019t down the end, they would be dispersed throughout the catchment. Now they\u2019re all gathering down that one end where the pool is.\u201d Brisbane has recorded 26.6mm of rainfall so far in January. It\u2019s not the driest January on record in the city, but well below the month average of 145.2mm. Elsewhere in south-east Queensland, some gauges have recorded no or negligible rainfall. At Coolangatta on the Gold Coast, 3.8mm has been recorded so far this month, compared to a January average of 161mm. At Maroochydore on the Sunshine Coast, 0.4mm has fallen compared to an average of 145.5mm. \u201cThe remainder of the month forecast is mainly fine, but nothing much in it precipitation-wise, just a shower here and there,\u201d the Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Mark Trenorden said. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty dry.\u201d At the Ashgrove end of Balun Park is a low bridge designed to flood, where families often take their dogs to swim. The water is usually waist deep; now it\u2019s a dry creek bed. The turtle bridge is at the opposite end of the park, at Kelvin Grove. The pool of remaining water stretches for only about 40m, but is bustling with wildlife. The turtles poke their heads out near the bridge, used to some people ignoring council signs and throwing in food. There are eels and fish, snakes, lizards and birdlife congregating at the murky waterhole. And every day, on either side of the bridge, the creek bed creeps a little closer.",

This was compounded by the club\u2019s name, Secrets.<em> </em>Shoooosh! Don\u2019t you dare tell anyone your dirty little secret!</p> <p>Our secret was that we were gay and many, like me, were closeted. The small town was Chatham in Kent, UK \u2013 somewhere the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/may/03/homes2\">described</a> as having \u201cthe general disposition towards gloominess, misery and greyness\u201d. But down in this deep, dark, pokey basement gay club, I discovered the colour, gloss and fabulosity that is voguing.</p> <p>The first and most important thing to say about voguing \u2013 a highly stylised, proudly queer form of dancing \u2013 is that is was invented not by Madonna, but by New York\u2019s black and Latino LGBTQI community. It became popular in the 1980s ball scene subculture in Harlem. Admittedly, though, it was later that I discovered its black history, to which I now give thanks and worship.</p> <p>The ball scene characterised by voguing is captured in the 1990 documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/jan/29/sundance-2015-paris-is-burning-restored-jennie-livingston\">Paris is Burning</a><em>,</em> currently on Netflix. Whenever a baby gay says he hasn\u2019t seen it, I rewatch it, to school him and re-delight myself. I must\u2019ve seen it a dozen times. It has a rich linguistic legacy, the impact on today\u2019s vernacular I\u2019ve <a href=\"https://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2018/01/09/linguistic-legacy-paris-is-burning/\">written</a> about.</p> <p>Voguing was more than just dance for the black, Hispanic and Asian queer people who attended those Harlem balls. It was fantastical escapism, defiance of social norms and a survival technique for those ostracised due to their race and sexual orientation. \u201cHouses\u201d were formed of surrogate families, headed by a drag, queer or trans \u201cmother\u201d who took care of her \u201cchildren\u201d, often after they\u2019d been kicked out of home when they came out. Houses were called names like the House of LaBeija, Xtravaganza or Ninja and the mother and children would adopt the surname of their House, creating alter egos in a microcosm where they were accepted and could compete with one another on the level playing field that society denied them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To continue their legacy feels, I hope, less like appropriation and more like appreciation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s no way I could compare my lot in life to theirs; I\u2019m especially sensitive to accusations of cultural appropriation which have sometimes been levelled at everyone from Madonna to Paris is Burning\u2019s white, lesbian director Jennie Livingston. But, like Livingston and Madonna, I was deeply inspired by them (while always checking my white privilege).</p> <p>When I frequented Secrets,<em> </em>it was 2000 and I was 17; the UK\u2019s age of consent hadn\u2019t yet been equalised to 16 so it was technically illegal for anyone to have sex with me. I had to find other ways to use up all that youthful energy.</p> <p>Although tiny, Secrets still crammed a stage inside its matchbox interior \u2013 every gay club, no matter how small, has a stage because all gays must be seen above other gays.</p> <p>The stage was mainly dominated by Monica, a trans woman who never missed a Saturday night at Secrets<em>. </em>All the makeup Maxine eschewed was compensated for by Monica, who wore enough for them both. In a way, they were the mothers of the House of Chatham: two strong women who shunned society\u2019s expectations of female conventions and lived their respective truths.</p> <p>Monica would rarely readily relinquish her stage but, as her children grew in confidence, she began to invite them up to showcase their talents to all 23 people watching from the dancefloor. When the Spice Girls\u2019 Who Do You Think You Are played, a chosen few would ascend.</p> <p>Everyone in Secrets had a song that was theirs.

      "bodyText": "It all started in a tiny, dimly lit, notorious basement club in a small town. You descended two sets of steep stairs to enter, then rang a bell and waited. Maxine, who eschewed makeup and pleasantries, opened the door two inches and asked: \u201cMember?\u201d If you weren\u2019t one, bye Felicia. It was to protect the people inside. Rumours of what happened inside were salacious. This was compounded by the club\u2019s name, Secrets. Shoooosh! Don\u2019t you dare tell anyone your dirty little secret! Our secret was that we were gay and many, like me, were closeted. The small town was Chatham in Kent, UK \u2013 somewhere the Guardian described as having \u201cthe general disposition towards gloominess, misery and greyness\u201d. But down in this deep, dark, pokey basement gay club, I discovered the colour, gloss and fabulosity that is voguing. The first and most important thing to say about voguing \u2013 a highly stylised, proudly queer form of dancing \u2013 is that is was invented not by Madonna, but by New York\u2019s black and Latino LGBTQI community. It became popular in the 1980s ball scene subculture in Harlem. Admittedly, though, it was later that I discovered its black history, to which I now give thanks and worship. The ball scene characterised by voguing is captured in the 1990 documentary Paris is Burning, currently on Netflix. Whenever a baby gay says he hasn\u2019t seen it, I rewatch it, to school him and re-delight myself. I must\u2019ve seen it a dozen times. It has a rich linguistic legacy, the impact on today\u2019s vernacular I\u2019ve written about. Voguing was more than just dance for the black, Hispanic and Asian queer people who attended those Harlem balls. It was fantastical escapism, defiance of social norms and a survival technique for those ostracised due to their race and sexual orientation. \u201cHouses\u201d were formed of surrogate families, headed by a drag, queer or trans \u201cmother\u201d who took care of her \u201cchildren\u201d, often after they\u2019d been kicked out of home when they came out. Houses were called names like the House of LaBeija, Xtravaganza or Ninja and the mother and children would adopt the surname of their House, creating alter egos in a microcosm where they were accepted and could compete with one another on the level playing field that society denied them. There\u2019s no way I could compare my lot in life to theirs; I\u2019m especially sensitive to accusations of cultural appropriation which have sometimes been levelled at everyone from Madonna to Paris is Burning\u2019s white, lesbian director Jennie Livingston. But, like Livingston and Madonna, I was deeply inspired by them (while always checking my white privilege). When I frequented Secrets, it was 2000 and I was 17; the UK\u2019s age of consent hadn\u2019t yet been equalised to 16 so it was technically illegal for anyone to have sex with me. I had to find other ways to use up all that youthful energy. Although tiny, Secrets still crammed a stage inside its matchbox interior \u2013 every gay club, no matter how small, has a stage because all gays must be seen above other gays. The stage was mainly dominated by Monica, a trans woman who never missed a Saturday night at Secrets. All the makeup Maxine eschewed was compensated for by Monica, who wore enough for them both. In a way, they were the mothers of the House of Chatham: two strong women who shunned society\u2019s expectations of female conventions and lived their respective truths. Monica would rarely readily relinquish her stage but, as her children grew in confidence, she began to invite them up to showcase their talents to all 23 people watching from the dancefloor. When the Spice Girls\u2019 Who Do You Think You Are played, a chosen few would ascend. Everyone in Secrets had a song that was theirs. An unwritten rule dictated that the stage would clear and the song was theirs to, unofficially, perform. For Matthew, my best friend, it was Shirley Bassey\u2019s History Repeating. \u201cSteps Lee\u201d had any song by Steps. A man known only as \u201cthe Grinch\u201d performed his self-choreographed, homosexually homicidal version of Murder on the Dancefloor. A screen would slowly unravel on the stage to display songs which had atmosphere-enhancing live performances when there was no unofficial stage performer.

I loved how it was unapologetically queer \u2013 both non-masculine but also comprising strong shapes and tough attitudes. It was choreographed cognitive dissonance. Willi Ninja, the world\u2019s greatest voguer, became my new hero and benchmark as soon as I learned about its black gay history on the pay-per-hour internet at my local library.

      "bodyText": "Scottish ministers are rushing through dozens of urgent legislative changes in an last-minute effort to protect Scottish businesses and consumers from a no-deal Brexit. The Scottish government has identified 36 legislative measures it believes are critical and must be in place before 29 March to ensure devolved areas such as farming, fisheries, food safety, the environment, animal welfare and forestry are protected if the UK crashes out of the EU. Officials and party business managers at Holyrood are preparing to order late parliamentary sittings, cancelling non-essential debates or votes and holding extra committee hearings to sit at the same time as parliament is in session to help cope with the surge in work. Mike Russell, Scotland\u2019s secretary for constitutional affairs, said his government had a duty to prepare for Brexit and was redeploying staff to do so. \u201cWe share the frustrations of businesses, communities and individuals across the country that we are being forced to prepare for a range of uncertain and unknown scenarios, diverting resources away from other areas, as we leave the EU against the wishes of the majority of Scots,\u201d he said. The former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has estimated the Scottish government\u2019s preparations for Brexit will cost nearly \u00a3100m by April 2020, including planning for a no-deal scenario. \u201cThe future total figure could be considerably greater, this is all money that could have been invested in our struggling NHS, schools or rail services,\u201d Dugdale said. Quitting the EU means hundreds of pieces of legislation need to be amended to ensure laws in force across the UK and devolved nations are updated to guarantee the same legal standards and protections in place now are in force after Brexit. Most of those changes are being pushed through Westminster, Holyrood and the Welsh assembly using statutory instruments, a type of secondary legislation that can be introduced without passing a new act. In some cases changes to different laws will be bundled up into one statutory instrument, and in some high-priority cases they require a parliamentary vote to agree them. Despite last year\u2019s legal battle between the UK and Scottish governments over Holyrood\u2019s emergency Brexit legislation, known as the continuity bill, Scottish and UK civil servants have agreed to share the workload in updating the affected laws. Whitehall has already written and overseen a large majority of the statutory instruments that affect Scottish legislation before sending those to Holyrood for formal approval under UK-wide \u201ccommon frameworks\u201d. By 23 January, 105 UK-wide statutory instruments had been passed by MSPs, covering areas such as nuclear safety, genetically modified foods, tobacco controls, greenhouse gas emissions trading, gender equality, renewable energy, organ transplants and food safety. However, that leaves scores of changes for Scottish ministers to oversee using Scottish statutory instruments (SSIs). In addition to the 36 critical measures that Holyrood needs to process before 29 March, dozens of other SSIs will need to be approved after Brexit day. Scottish ministers are cautious about disclosing the titles of these measures before they are tabled, citing the need to observe the protocol that parliament should be told first. Russell is meanwhile in talks with opposition parties about when and whether to table an amended continuity bill. The UK supreme court ruled in December that the continuity bill was unlawful, in large part because the UK government altered Holyrood\u2019s legal powers after it had been introduced, stopping it being enacted in its current form. He would not be drawn on what would happen next, but legal sources say they believe its fate hangs on what happens with Brexit at Westminster. Opposition MSPs suspect Russell plans to table new farming and fisheries bills after Brexit, which could cause friction with UK legislation being proposed by Michael Gove, the environment secretary.",

The only woman on the list is Lubov Chernukhin, whose husband, Vladimir, is a Russian former deputy finance minister under President Vladimir Putin. A regular member of the CLG, she has given more than \u00a3600,000 to the Tories since 2012, including \u00a3160,000 to play tennis with Boris Johnson and \u00a330,000 to dine with the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson. The investor Dominic Johnson, who previously attended two dinners with May in 2017, is the co-founder of Somerset Capital Management, an investment firm set up by himself and the Tory hard Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg. Somerset was last year reported to be warning its clients about \u201cconsiderable uncertainty\u201d as a result of Brexit, and set up a new fund in Ireland, which benefits from EU financial passporting rights.

While the club is unlikely to ever re-scale the preposterous heights scaled under Brian Clough, they have taken what they will hope is a step in the right direction by welcoming Roy Keane <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/28/roy-keane-agrees-martin-oneill-nottingham-forest-no2-assistant\">back to the City Ground</a>. A Forest legend who once declared \u201cmy heart is in this club\u201d six months before his inevitable departure for pastures more lucrative and successful, Keane has agreed to become the club\u2019s assistant manager, resuming his gig as Even Worse Cop to Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s Bad Cop in a reprise of the roles the duo performed for the Republic O\u2019Ireland with varying degrees of success (and more latterly abject failure).</p> <p>Unlike most assistant managers, who tend to be appointed with a minimum of fuss and fanfare, Keane\u2019s return is a major talking point, not least due to his O\u2019Ireland time with O\u2019Neill. Previously a manager with Sunderland and Ipswich Town but content for now as an assistant, Keane is renowned for generating conflicting emotions in \u2013 and conflict with \u2013 his charges. One suspects his decision to take the role will be the source of considerable dressing-room trepidation. \u201cBasically, you\u2019re $hit,\u201d he once told his bemused players at Sunderland before a game at Aston Villa. \u201cTry and enjoy the game. You\u2019re probably going to get beat. But just enjoy being $hit.\u201d And to be fair, while this stirring rhetoric would prove sufficiently inspirational to help his team earn a draw at the time, his assessment would ultimately prove correct. Clough and Taylor 2.0 or a Stan &amp; Ollie reboot?

You immediately assume all other news will have to be cancelled for the day while the headmaster/prime minister runs around the playground/British Isles trying to catch it with a big net. It\u2019s a genre with a low bar for entry \u2013 as a rule of thumb, any \u201canimal in unexpected place\u201d story is newsworthy as long as you can imagine a Brooklyn cab driver in a live-action Disney movie doing a double-take, rubbing their eyes and saying, \u201cWoah, an [animal] in a [unexpected place]? I better quit drinking,\u201d upon seeing it. But every so often there comes a variation that lifts the genre into new and exciting places. This is no \u201cmonkey in Ikea\u201d, \u201ccat on a football pitch\u201d or even \u201cwhale in the Thames\u201d (RIP). No, today there was a red panda loose in Belfast.

Such things informed Moon and Me\u2019s narrative, which is inspired by the Rumer Godden and Enid Blyton toyhouse stories of the 1930s and 40s. Pepi Nana is a toy who comes to life whenever the moon comes out (and her owner is asleep). Moon Baby visits them from the moon and, in what some people might deem a rude guest, proceeds to wake the rest of the toyhouse with an African thumb piano. He then guides them to Storyland for a story and a song. The whole thing retains the magical vibe of In the Night Garden, yet has a more traditional and homemade feel.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s hard to imagine it causing the same uproar Teletubbies did when it arrived in 1997. Back then there were tabloid panics that it was turning toddlers\u2019 brains to mush, or that the show contained secret gay messages (Tinky Winky carried \u2013 shock! Horror! \u2013 a handbag). Locals staged protests. Helicopters would fly over the field in which it was filmed, with photographers onboard hoping to reveal the faces of the actors in the costumes. Visitors to the set had to be blindfolded, for fear they might give away the location.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"feb81e5f0a019a83745447371847e1a21fe821dd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/feb81e5f0a019a83745447371847e1a21fe821dd/0_0_1336_1773/754.jpg\" alt=\"Teletubbies.\" width=\"754\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The baby show that caused tabloid panic \u2026 Teletubbies.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe just hadn\u2019t prepared for that kind of interest at all,\u201d says Davenport. \u201cPeople\u2019s relatives were getting doorstepped, which is a surprising place to be in thanks to a pre-school children\u2019s television programme. And the show took on a meaning of its own in the culture that was a little uncontrollable, which in hindsight was fine, but did mean a lot of things were said about it that weren\u2019t true.\u201d</p> \n<p>When Davenport wrote In the Night Garden, a gently psychedelic affair conceived as a way of guiding children to bed, he was braced for more mayhem. But the only drama came when the BBC tried to move the broadcast time \u2013 the show was so popular with parents that it had already become an essential part of the bedtime routine.</p> \n<p>That hasn\u2019t stopped people projecting wild meanings on to the show. Buzzfeed called it a \u201csurrealist orgy of sex and death\u201d, which seems a bit much given the claim was mainly centred around Upsy Daisy occasionally flashing her knickers. Elsewhere online, someone has constructed an ambitious theory that the show is all a dying hallucination in the mind of Iggle Piggle, who is actually a dehydrated sailor lost at sea. Has Davenport heard that one?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7baeee5be002c36adda4b4c89c2455b7ed92cd1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7baeee5be002c36adda4b4c89c2455b7ed92cd1/0_177_1736_1042/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In the Night Garden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A surrealist orgy of sex and death? ...

I don\u2019t know whether to look that up or not! But if you worry about stuff like that you\u2019re in the wrong business. People are creative, they write their own jokes and obviously there are readings that are ... less savoury, that I probably wouldn\u2019t want to know about.\u201d</p> \n<p>I wonder if the murky world of the internet, which has taken over culture in the 20 years since Teletubbies landed, plays any part in his writing. Davenport says Moon and Me had to be versatile to different formats, and accepts that lots of viewers will be watching on phones and tablets. Teletubbies was actually conceived as a way of helping children understand the new world of screens, but it seems almost quaint compared to the technology today. What does Davenport make of it?</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a double edged sword,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember when my godson was younger, the first thing he\u2019d say was \u2018hello\u2019 and then \u2018can I have the iPad?\u2019 and I wouldn\u2019t see him again. It did slightly devalue the experience of going to see him.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a way, Moon and Me is a reaction to such technology \u2013 a show about play that doesn\u2019t involve screens. \u201cThe characters are constantly shown drawing, reading books, painting, making things, doing things with their hands,\u201d explains Davenport. \u201cHands are a big theme of the show. There are over 500 objects in the toy house and every one is handmade, handpainted.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6b9813e4-030a-49fe-9571-729fd1e26219\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tCTZMrddBgI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Davenport also banned any computer generated imagery (\u201cquite a fight\u201d), instead turning to puppetry, stop-motion animation and homemade effects. \u201cChildren are fascinated by real objects,\u201d he says. \u201cThey will be able to see the weave of the fabric, the joins in the wallpaper, the printing on the wallpaper. There\u2019s a joy in seeing the messiness.\u201d</p> \n<p>Davenport\u2019s background is an arty one: you can see him flinging his limbs around impressively on a Soho roof for <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/152275595\">Mehdi Norowzian\u2019s short film Joy</a> (which \u201cinspired\u201d the famous Guinness advert Anticipation \u2013 the whole thing ended up in court). And he was once a model for Gilbert and George, after he heard they were looking for a model with \u201cbig eyes\u201d. They were paying \u00a330 cash in hand \u2013 \u201cwhich was significant back then\u201d \u2013 so he found them in the Yellow Pages under \u201cartists\u201d and gave them a call. George answered, invited him for tea the next day, and he ended up staring out from one their artworks entitled Eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve never actually seen it in person,\u201d he confesses. \u201cBut I remember sitting on a train reading a Big Issue feature about them, and suddenly realising that the piece of work I was looking at was me!\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet it was his rather less arty degree course in speech sciences that proved the bigger influence on his TV work.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"784e26cfad5b28c1ec5ff04fd4c38298c520842a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/784e26cfad5b28c1ec5ff04fd4c38298c520842a/0_0_1807_2259/800.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Davenport.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Technology is a double edged sword\u2019 \u2026 Andrew Davenport.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicholas Dawkes</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cBack in the early 90s, a lot of teachers had become television makers and there was an emphasis towards schooling,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere I came from, the focus was very much on the early years, the first three years of life, where the fundamental processes of becoming human are all happening \u2013 learning to speak, learning to walk and crawl. All of that happens in an incredibly short time, which is where my fascination with play comes from. You can largely tell what\u2019s going on by the way a child is playing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Davenport\u2019s ideas were pretty radical at the time \u2013 incorporating the likes of Jean Piaget and Noam Chomsky into his surreal stories \u2013 but that didn\u2019t stop people criticising Teletubbies. Stephen Byers, the schools minister at the time, even said it represented a \u201cdumbing down\u201d of British culture, due to its supposedly unintelligible language. \u201cI think the rigour in which it was constructed was largely missed,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>Even now, Davenport is glad of the chance to explain how much thought goes into his hit shows. Yet despite his slightly terrifying insight into these unknowable little minds, he still gets extremely nervous before any new programme airs.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe whole thing only comes together fully at the very last minute, so you never really know how it\u2019s going to go down until the audience get to see it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Given that every morning since our interview, my daughter has woken up and asked \u201cWhere\u2019s Pepi Nana?\u201d repeatedly until we put it on, I think he\u2019s probably going to be ok.</p> \n<p><em>Moon and Me starts on CBeebies on 4 February.</em></p>",

He then guides them to Storyland for a story and a song. The whole thing retains the magical vibe of In the Night Garden, yet has a more traditional and homemade feel. It\u2019s hard to imagine it causing the same uproar Teletubbies did when it arrived in 1997. Back then there were tabloid panics that it was turning toddlers\u2019 brains to mush, or that the show contained secret gay messages (Tinky Winky carried \u2013 shock! Horror! \u2013 a handbag). Locals staged protests. Helicopters would fly over the field in which it was filmed, with photographers onboard hoping to reveal the faces of the actors in the costumes. Visitors to the set had to be blindfolded, for fear they might give away the location. \u201cWe just hadn\u2019t prepared for that kind of interest at all,\u201d says Davenport. \u201cPeople\u2019s relatives were getting doorstepped, which is a surprising place to be in thanks to a pre-school children\u2019s television programme. And the show took on a meaning of its own in the culture that was a little uncontrollable, which in hindsight was fine, but did mean a lot of things were said about it that weren\u2019t true.\u201d When Davenport wrote In the Night Garden, a gently psychedelic affair conceived as a way of guiding children to bed, he was braced for more mayhem. But the only drama came when the BBC tried to move the broadcast time \u2013 the show was so popular with parents that it had already become an essential part of the bedtime routine. That hasn\u2019t stopped people projecting wild meanings on to the show. Buzzfeed called it a \u201csurrealist orgy of sex and death\u201d, which seems a bit much given the claim was mainly centred around Upsy Daisy occasionally flashing her knickers. Elsewhere online, someone has constructed an ambitious theory that the show is all a dying hallucination in the mind of Iggle Piggle, who is actually a dehydrated sailor lost at sea. Has Davenport heard that one? There\u2019s a pause. \u201cEr ... no. In a word. I don\u2019t know whether to look that up or not! But if you worry about stuff like that you\u2019re in the wrong business. People are creative, they write their own jokes and obviously there are readings that are ... less savoury, that I probably wouldn\u2019t want to know about.\u201d I wonder if the murky world of the internet, which has taken over culture in the 20 years since Teletubbies landed, plays any part in his writing. Davenport says Moon and Me had to be versatile to different formats, and accepts that lots of viewers will be watching on phones and tablets. Teletubbies was actually conceived as a way of helping children understand the new world of screens, but it seems almost quaint compared to the technology today. What does Davenport make of it? \u201cI think it\u2019s a double edged sword,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember when my godson was younger, the first thing he\u2019d say was \u2018hello\u2019 and then \u2018can I have the iPad?\u2019 and I wouldn\u2019t see him again. It did slightly devalue the experience of going to see him.\u201d In a way, Moon and Me is a reaction to such technology \u2013 a show about play that doesn\u2019t involve screens. \u201cThe characters are constantly shown drawing, reading books, painting, making things, doing things with their hands,\u201d explains Davenport. \u201cHands are a big theme of the show. There are over 500 objects in the toy house and every one is handmade, handpainted.\u201d Davenport also banned any computer generated imagery (\u201cquite a fight\u201d), instead turning to puppetry, stop-motion animation and homemade effects. \u201cChildren are fascinated by real objects,\u201d he says. \u201cThey will be able to see the weave of the fabric, the joins in the wallpaper, the printing on the wallpaper. There\u2019s a joy in seeing the messiness.\u201d Davenport\u2019s background is an arty one: you can see him flinging his limbs around impressively on a Soho roof for Mehdi Norowzian\u2019s short film Joy (which \u201cinspired\u201d the famous Guinness advert Anticipation \u2013 the whole thing ended up in court). And he was once a model for Gilbert and George, after he heard they were looking for a model with \u201cbig eyes\u201d. They were paying \u00a330 cash in hand \u2013 \u201cwhich was significant back then\u201d \u2013 so he found them in the Yellow Pages under \u201cartists\u201d and gave them a call. George answered, invited him for tea the next day, and he ended up staring out from one their artworks entitled Eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve never actually seen it in person,\u201d he confesses. \u201cBut I remember sitting on a train reading a Big Issue feature about them, and suddenly realising that the piece of work I was looking at was me!\u201d Yet it was his rather less arty degree course in speech sciences that proved the bigger influence on his TV work. \u201cBack in the early 90s, a lot of teachers had become television makers and there was an emphasis towards schooling,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere I came from, the focus was very much on the early years, the first three years of life, where the fundamental processes of becoming human are all happening \u2013 learning to speak, learning to walk and crawl. All of that happens in an incredibly short time, which is where my fascination with play comes from. You can largely tell what\u2019s going on by the way a child is playing.\u201d Davenport\u2019s ideas were pretty radical at the time \u2013 incorporating the likes of Jean Piaget and Noam Chomsky into his surreal stories \u2013 but that didn\u2019t stop people criticising Teletubbies. Stephen Byers, the schools minister at the time, even said it represented a \u201cdumbing down\u201d of British culture, due to its supposedly unintelligible language. \u201cI think the rigour in which it was constructed was largely missed,\u201d he says. Even now, Davenport is glad of the chance to explain how much thought goes into his hit shows. Yet despite his slightly terrifying insight into these unknowable little minds, he still gets extremely nervous before any new programme airs. \u201cThe whole thing only comes together fully at the very last minute, so you never really know how it\u2019s going to go down until the audience get to see it.\u201d Given that every morning since our interview, my daughter has woken up and asked \u201cWhere\u2019s Pepi Nana?\u201d repeatedly until we put it on, I think he\u2019s probably going to be ok. Moon and Me starts on CBeebies on 4 February.",

More than four million people liked the post, captioned simply: \u201chappy sunday.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"36a2116c34f092e4587aede24833501cade642ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36a2116c34f092e4587aede24833501cade642ed/1579_208_3769_3769/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Queentonia Ojeka: \u2018I love Kylie Jenner \u2026 her fashion is evolving.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queentonia Ojeka: \u2018I love Kylie Jenner \u2026 her fashion is evolving.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Leicester, a 20-year-old student Queentonia Ojeka studied the post closely. She liked the length of the blazer and how the shorts hit mid-thigh. Also, it looked comfortable. So Ojeka did what millions of young women across the country do every day: went online and purchased a tweed blazer from the American low-cost retailer Fashion Nova for $30 (\u00a323), which she paired with \u00a38 chocolate-brown cycling shorts from the British brand PrettyLittleThing. \u201cI love Kylie Jenner,\u201d Ojeka laughs. \u201cAs much as I hate to admit [it]. Her fashion is evolving, which is why I like her even more.\u201d</p> <p>Corsets. Orthopaedic trainers. Crop tops. Cycling shorts. Cycling sunglasses. Sequinned slip dresses. Lace bodysuits. Neon. Latex. Thigh-high boots. These are all fashion trends the Kardashians have helped popularise internationally. In bedrooms across the country, women painstakingly contour, bake and overline their lips in an approximation of the Kardashian makeup aesthetic. In nightclubs, you\u2019ll see Kardashian disciples teetering in Lycra bodycon and spike heels.</p> <p>Clothing this growing army of Kardashian clones is a fast-growing industry of ultra-low-cost online retailers. There is PrettyLittleThing, Missguided, Boohoo, Nastygal and the US phenomenon Fashion Nova, but newer players including Oh Polly and MissPap are also entering the space. Browse these sites, and you will see yards of figure-hugging lycra and cheap lace in neon, pastel, or earthy tones. For the price of a large takeaway pizza (dresses hover at around the \u00a315 mark, and sales are always on), you can own an outfit that \u2013 if you squint hard enough \u2013 could be from a Kardashian-Jenner\u2019s Instagram post. It is a good time to be a model who resembles one of the Kardashians, too: lookalikes such as Lalla Rania Benchegra, who has modelled for PrettyLittleThing and appeared in campaigns for Fashion Nova, are in high demand. </p> <p>For the uninitiated, the Kardashians rose to fame in 2007 with their reality TV show Keeping Up With the Kardashians, after the release of second-oldest daughter Kim\u2019s sex tape. (The family had a certain degree of notoriety already thanks to the late Robert Kardashian\u2019s involvement in the OJ Simpson murder trial: he was Simpson\u2019s friend, and served on his legal team.) Just over a decade on, the family\u2019s status as the Medicis of modern celebrity is assured: between them, they have a combined Instagram following of more than 536 million people, and Keeping Up With the Kardashians has run for 15 seasons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"179f2e4654918a75f28e6d0f07f70f88e585e0b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/179f2e4654918a75f28e6d0f07f70f88e585e0b3/412_0_2929_2929/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West on the front row during Paris fashion week, 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West on the front row during Paris fashion week, 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the Kardashians weren\u2019t always an unstoppable global fashion juggernaut. For years, they dressed in clothes you could buy in the average department store (their Kardashian Kollection was stocked in the US retailer Sears). Then, in 2012, Kim began dating Kanye West, who introduced her to designers including Olivier Rousteing at Balmain and Riccardo Tisci at Givenchy, as well as his own Yeezy brand. Gone was the polyester animal print and in was an athleisure-inspired silhouette. The West association arguably conferred credibility upon the family: by 2014, Kim was gracing the cover of Vogue in a strapless Lanvin wedding dress.</p> <p>Back then, Instagram was in its infancy, but as the Kardashians\u2019 stars rose within the high-fashion firmament, they cemented their celebrity status on social media. In 2012, the year Kim began dating West, she reached a million followers on Instagram: just seven years later, she would top out at more than 125 million. \u201cThey are very influential, just because of how much they\u2019re talked about,\u201d says Ojeka. \u201cThey\u2019re spoken about; they\u2019re on everything.\u201d</p> <p>The Kardashians patronise such brands as Boohoo and Fashion Nova, switching allegiances for monetary reward. <a href=\"https://www.hopperhq.com/blog/instagram-rich-list/\" title=\"\">According to the Instagram marketers Hopper HQ</a>, a single post on Kylie\u2019s Instagram will set you back a cool $1m; you can have Kim for $750,000. Brands that affiliate themselves with the Kardashians, whether officially or unofficially, experience mega-growth. Fashion Nova was the <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2018/US/\" title=\"\">most-searched-for fashion brand on Google</a> in the US in 2018. Boohoo\u2019s UK sales rose by a third to \u00a3180m in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/15/boohoo-raises-sales-forecast-after-christmas-bonanza\" title=\"\">last four months of 2018</a>, with its strong performance credited in part to a <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/01/11/kourtney-kardashian-plus-size-range-help-boohoo-double-revenues/\" title=\"\">successful collaboration</a> with the eldest Kardashian daughter, Kourtney, who has long championed the brand. (Sales increased 95% at PrettyLittleThing, and 74% at Nasty Girl in the same period.) The success of such companies comes as established players in the UK retail market struggle: Asos recently posted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/17/asos-issues-shock-profit-warning-as-november-downturn-takes-hold-fashion-retailer\" title=\"\">shock profit warning</a>, and sales are also in decline at Topshop. Even negative press can\u2019t scupper their mega-growth: Boohoo was recently criticised for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/09/asa-real-fur-fake-faux-boohoo-zacharia-jewellers\" title=\"\">selling real fur jumpers it had advertised as fake</a>.</p> <p>What makes these retailers so successful? Dr Jonathan Reynolds, a retail and e-commerce expert at the University of Oxford, says they have some distinct advantages. As most are online-only (Missguided has two physical stores in the UK), they don\u2019t pay for retail space, which means they can have shorter product runs and test new products out. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a store, you have to fill it with goods, which means you have to have a big inventory.

Fashion Nova\u2019s network of more than 3,000 influencers, including Kylie Jenner and Cardi B, are critical to its success. They post pictures of themselves wearing outfits that are immediately available to purchase online. If the item sells, great; if not, the brand moves on to the next thing, unencumbered by large amounts of stock. On Fashion Nova, you can currently buy a white polyester minidress modelled by Kylie herself for $32.99, plus postage. And if your brand can\u2019t afford to drop millions on Kardashian endorsement then in-house design teams can produce knock-offs of designer items worn by celebrities within days. After Kim\u2019s aesthetic? A neon-pink minidress similar to the one she wore to Kylie\u2019s 21st birthday party could be yours, from Boohoo, for just \u00a34. \u201cI\u2019ve seen girls wearing that pink dress out on the town,\u201d says 25-year-old handbag designer Lauren Levin, from Leeds. \u201cIt\u2019s a very popular style.\u201d Levin frequently hears from customers wanting a Kardashian look. When Kim toted a neon bag in August 2018, Levin had so many requests, she created a replica. \u201cThey definitely have a massive influence on my generation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey can sell anything,\u201d agrees Pamela Church-Gibson, the author of Fashion and Celebrity Culture. She describes them as being at the centre of an \u201calternate fashion system\u201d, which \u201cis not people looking at pictures of fashion shows and interpreting the trends themselves, it\u2019s women wanting to look a certain way, social media providing those images, and new retailers, particularly retailers that use social media a lot, like Boohoo, picking up on these trends and bucking it to their advantage\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"21c5e8cc8eb23a7e715ba5f1f0af7184292bc336\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21c5e8cc8eb23a7e715ba5f1f0af7184292bc336/0_1279_3840_3161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tanyel Hassan: \u2018When it comes to clothes, they know how to dress.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"823\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tanyel Hassan: \u2018When it comes to clothes, they know how to dress.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen it comes to clothes, they know how to dress,\u201d says 23-year-old Tanyel Hassan, of the Kardashians. \u201cIf there\u2019s an outfit they\u2019ve got on for, say, thousands of pounds, I go on Boohoo or Missguided to see if I can get one that\u2019s inspired by that, but cheaper.\u201d Hassan, a teacher from east London, spends \u00a350 a month on clothes; if she is going on holiday, she will pick up a new wardrobe for \u00a3300. When Kim wore a black lace bustier at Paris fashion week in 2016, Hassan purchased a copycat from Boohoo for \u00a312. When Kylie posed in a bodycon, calf-length dress in September 2018, Hassan bought a \u00a320 Missguided version.</p> <p>Yet the Kardashians don\u2019t just sell clothes, but a way of being. \u201cThe Kardashians live aspirational and over-the-top lifestyles,\u201d says Amanda McClain, author of Keeping Up the Kardashian Brand: Celebrity, Materialism, and Sexuality. Dress like a Kardashian, and you can approximate a lifestyle otherwise beyond your reach, with low-cost retailers bridging the gap. \u201cIt makes it so much easier to be able to have even a little glimpse of being in their shoes,\u201d says Ojeka.</p> <p>For some young Kardashian fans, social media can be the most important part of a night out, says Emily Hall of social influencer experts the Goat Agency. \u201cThey\u2019ll have full-on photoshoots before they go out, because they\u2019re looking for that approval from a wider audience.\u201d But when your wardrobe is reverse-engineered to maximise likes, posting the same outfit twice is heresy.</p> <p>All the women I speak to concede there is enormous pressure to look good online. \u201cI do think it has a negative effect,\u201d Levin says. \u201cBecause when I post things on social media and I don\u2019t get as many likes as the photo before, I think, what\u2019s wrong with me? I\u2019m very aware there\u2019s a big pressure, and that comes from the Kardashian age we live in today.\u201d She\u2019s not alone in feeling the strain: a recent study of 1,300 British teenagers from researchers at the University of Birmingham found that the pressure to post flattering selfies online was creating body dissatisfaction and misery among schoolchildren. The most popular body type being celebrated by these young people? A slim waist, large breasts and hips \u2013 sound familiar?</p> <p>According to data from Mintel, 22% of consumers say that social media influences the clothing they buy, a figure that rises to 64% in the Generation Z (under 22 years old) demographic. \u201cIt accelerates a cycle of spend-consumption,\u201d Church-Gibson says. \u201cIt is worrying, how fast this process moves.\u201d</p> <p>To make this fashion even faster, brands have relocated their manufacturing back to the UK in order to shorten the time between seeing an outfit online and purchasing it. Leicester\u2019s once-ossifying garment industry has cranked back into production. While this might sound like good news, an FT investigation recently found evidence of workers being paid below minimum wage. Low-cost retailers facilitate impulse purchasing with a \u201c\u2018test and repeat\u2019 strategy,\u201d explains Saisangeeth Daswani of the trends intelligence company Stylus. \u201cThey\u2019re producing very small quantities of many different styles, within a short turnaround time of approximately two to four weeks.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/nov/27/mps-criticise-high-street-fashion-throwaway-culture\">MPs criticise high street fashion's throwaway culture</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Should we care that armies of young women are clothing themselves in one-wear outfits?

There was more public outrage when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jul/20/why-does-burberry-destroy-its-products-q-and-a\" title=\"\">Burberry burned its excess stock</a>, De Castro says, than when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/apr/24/bangladeshi-police-target-garment-workers-union-rana-plaza-five-years-on\" title=\"\">Rana Plaza collapsed</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to make consumers empathise with workers \u2026 they feel their lives are hard enough, and can\u2019t identify with someone else\u2019s hardship.\u201d </p> <p>In an age of low pay and general economic malaise, you can understand the appeal of a \u00a34 dress that makes you feel, however fleetingly, like a Kardashian. \u201cIf you\u2019ve worked hard, you deserve to feel good, and when you\u2019re dressed in clothes that you love, you feel good about yourself,\u201d says Hassan.</p> <p>But what makes this Kardashian aesthetic so appealing to young women? \u201cThe look is always the same,\u201d Church-Gibson observes. \u201cIt always follows the same shape. Everything is tight; the heels are very high.\u201d High-fashion designs are put through a Kardashian filter, such as when Kim wore a Celine dress in March 2017. \u201cThe Celine aesthetic is very loose, and worn with sneakers, but she paired it with very high heels,\u201d Church-Gibson explains, describing the Kardashian aesthetic as \u201csexy, rather than fashionable\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16cbb17123fd0f2c0f0b76909ba9c09970fb48c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16cbb17123fd0f2c0f0b76909ba9c09970fb48c2/0_160_2400_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian: the look is \u2018sexy but intercahngeable\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian: the look is \u2018sexy but interchangeable\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RMGLE/MEGA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Church-Gibson has watched the Kardashian influence spread like a virus through British wardrobes with dismay. \u201cWhat worries me is that everybody looks so similar.

The Kardashian aesthetic is the anti-Man Repeller look; a hyper-feminised, high-glamour look that seems calculated to entice the male gaze. Acolytes of the Kardashian style \u201cdo look very sexy, but they are interchangeable\u201d, says Church-Gibson. \u201cIn a way, it\u2019s the death of individuality.\u201d</p> <p>And while the Kardashians are sometimes celebrated for popularising a new, more curvaceous \u201cslim-thick\u201d body type, it\u2019s a shape that is arguably as inaccessible as the very slim ideal that preceded it. \u201cThey\u2019ve simply helped swap one unattainable beauty standard for another,\u201d says Yomi Adegoke, a freelance journalist and the co-author of Slay In Your Lane, who has written about the Kardashian influence in beauty. \u201cThe ideal has been replaced with a want for ethnically ambiguous women with curves, but only in certain places.

      "bodyText": "On 30 September 2018, Kylie Jenner \u2013 Kardashian scion, businesswoman and owner of a world-famous pout \u2013 uploaded a photo to Instagram. In it, she posed beside a blacked-out Range Rover in a pink Katharine Hamnett jacket, cinched at the waist with a grey Chanel bumbag. Underneath, she wore black cycling shorts, white socks and chunky Joshua Sanders trainers in a silvery metallic finish. More than four million people liked the post, captioned simply: \u201chappy sunday.\u201d In Leicester, a 20-year-old student Queentonia Ojeka studied the post closely. She liked the length of the blazer and how the shorts hit mid-thigh. Also, it looked comfortable. So Ojeka did what millions of young women across the country do every day: went online and purchased a tweed blazer from the American low-cost retailer Fashion Nova for $30 (\u00a323), which she paired with \u00a38 chocolate-brown cycling shorts from the British brand PrettyLittleThing. \u201cI love Kylie Jenner,\u201d Ojeka laughs. \u201cAs much as I hate to admit [it]. Her fashion is evolving, which is why I like her even more.\u201d Corsets. Orthopaedic trainers. Crop tops. Cycling shorts. Cycling sunglasses. Sequinned slip dresses. Lace bodysuits. Neon. Latex. Thigh-high boots. These are all fashion trends the Kardashians have helped popularise internationally. In bedrooms across the country, women painstakingly contour, bake and overline their lips in an approximation of the Kardashian makeup aesthetic. In nightclubs, you\u2019ll see Kardashian disciples teetering in Lycra bodycon and spike heels. Clothing this growing army of Kardashian clones is a fast-growing industry of ultra-low-cost online retailers. There is PrettyLittleThing, Missguided, Boohoo, Nastygal and the US phenomenon Fashion Nova, but newer players including Oh Polly and MissPap are also entering the space. Browse these sites, and you will see yards of figure-hugging lycra and cheap lace in neon, pastel, or earthy tones. For the price of a large takeaway pizza (dresses hover at around the \u00a315 mark, and sales are always on), you can own an outfit that \u2013 if you squint hard enough \u2013 could be from a Kardashian-Jenner\u2019s Instagram post. It is a good time to be a model who resembles one of the Kardashians, too: lookalikes such as Lalla Rania Benchegra, who has modelled for PrettyLittleThing and appeared in campaigns for Fashion Nova, are in high demand. For the uninitiated, the Kardashians rose to fame in 2007 with their reality TV show Keeping Up With the Kardashians, after the release of second-oldest daughter Kim\u2019s sex tape. (The family had a certain degree of notoriety already thanks to the late Robert Kardashian\u2019s involvement in the OJ Simpson murder trial: he was Simpson\u2019s friend, and served on his legal team.) Just over a decade on, the family\u2019s status as the Medicis of modern celebrity is assured: between them, they have a combined Instagram following of more than 536 million people, and Keeping Up With the Kardashians has run for 15 seasons. But the Kardashians weren\u2019t always an unstoppable global fashion juggernaut. For years, they dressed in clothes you could buy in the average department store (their Kardashian Kollection was stocked in the US retailer Sears). Then, in 2012, Kim began dating Kanye West, who introduced her to designers including Olivier Rousteing at Balmain and Riccardo Tisci at Givenchy, as well as his own Yeezy brand. Gone was the polyester animal print and in was an athleisure-inspired silhouette. The West association arguably conferred credibility upon the family: by 2014, Kim was gracing the cover of Vogue in a strapless Lanvin wedding dress. Back then, Instagram was in its infancy, but as the Kardashians\u2019 stars rose within the high-fashion firmament, they cemented their celebrity status on social media. In 2012, the year Kim began dating West, she reached a million followers on Instagram: just seven years later, she would top out at more than 125 million. \u201cThey are very influential, just because of how much they\u2019re talked about,\u201d says Ojeka. \u201cThey\u2019re spoken about; they\u2019re on everything.\u201d The Kardashians patronise such brands as Boohoo and Fashion Nova, switching allegiances for monetary reward. According to the Instagram marketers Hopper HQ, a single post on Kylie\u2019s Instagram will set you back a cool $1m; you can have Kim for $750,000. Brands that affiliate themselves with the Kardashians, whether officially or unofficially, experience mega-growth. Fashion Nova was the most-searched-for fashion brand on Google in the US in 2018. Boohoo\u2019s UK sales rose by a third to \u00a3180m in the last four months of 2018, with its strong performance credited in part to a successful collaboration with the eldest Kardashian daughter, Kourtney, who has long championed the brand. (Sales increased 95% at PrettyLittleThing, and 74% at Nasty Girl in the same period.) The success of such companies comes as established players in the UK retail market struggle: Asos recently posted a shock profit warning, and sales are also in decline at Topshop. Even negative press can\u2019t scupper their mega-growth: Boohoo was recently criticised for selling real fur jumpers it had advertised as fake. What makes these retailers so successful? Dr Jonathan Reynolds, a retail and e-commerce expert at the University of Oxford, says they have some distinct advantages. As most are online-only (Missguided has two physical stores in the UK), they don\u2019t pay for retail space, which means they can have shorter product runs and test new products out. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a store, you have to fill it with goods, which means you have to have a big inventory. So they are a much more agile kind of business, which seems to chime today with the fairly instant culture we have.\u201d The pulsating sun at the centre of this new fashion solar system is Instagram. Fashion Nova\u2019s network of more than 3,000 influencers, including Kylie Jenner and Cardi B, are critical to its success. They post pictures of themselves wearing outfits that are immediately available to purchase online. If the item sells, great; if not, the brand moves on to the next thing, unencumbered by large amounts of stock.

During the 2018 British parliamentary inquiry into fast fashion, MPs accused Boohoo of selling cheap dresses that charity shops were likely to snub. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day when Topshop would look like couture, but with the rise of even cheaper brands like PrettyLittleThing, it\u2019s making it look that way,\u201d says Orsola de Castro of the sustainability campaigners Fashion Revolution. \u201cIf you\u2019re buying a dress that costs \u00a38, approximately less than a meal, inevitably someone along the supply chain, if not quite a few people, will be suffering.\u201d A recent Fashion Revolution study found that British consumers care the least about the impact of disposable fashion of all the countries they surveyed.

But what makes this Kardashian aesthetic so appealing to young women? \u201cThe look is always the same,\u201d Church-Gibson observes. \u201cIt always follows the same shape.

Dedicated evidence gatherers put themselves in the way of danger and obtained a substantial amount of footage of the violent disorder.\u201d Questioned about how the violence started, Twist added: \u201cAt the moment it would seem likely there were an arranged meet.\u201d He also said he was confident the perpetrators would be brought to justice and the Met would try to ensure they could not attend matches in future. \u201cWe have a highly skilled team closely reviewing this evidence and I am confident we will soon know the identities of those involved,\u201d he added. \u201cWe will use this evidence and all tools within our power to locate the individuals involved in this ridiculous behaviour, whether they come from London, Liverpool or elsewhere. We will bring them to justice.\u201d Millwall\u2019s chief executive, Steve Kavanagh, has promised to ban any fans involved in discriminatory behaviour for life \u2013 but insisted that it was a \u201cvery, very small minority\u201d that had caused any issues. He said: \u201cThe majority of fans were absolutely fantastic on Saturday and created an atmosphere and helped create a result the FA should be proud of for the competition, and yet we\u2019re giving these idiots the oxygen after what they did, and that\u2019s just crazy. \u201cIf we can get these people, we\u2019ll ban them, we\u2019ll deal with them. We\u2019ll do whatever we can do. The vast majority of the fans are fantastic people, they\u2019re proud of their club and they create an unbelievable atmosphere. They don\u2019t want to cross that line, but there are a few uneducated people who don\u2019t understand. \u201cAnd let\u2019s be straight, this isn\u2019t just a Millwall issue,\u201d he told TalkSport. \u201cChelsea have had a lot of issues recently and there was a banana thrown [by a Tottenham fan] recently.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Like many families, mine has been divided by politics in recent years. I am British; my dad has returned to his native Hungary. I work for the Guardian; he has become a supporter of Hungary\u2019s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. It had become a festering sore. He loves talking politics, and resented the fact that he couldn\u2019t discuss politics with me. I couldn\u2019t talk about it, because I resented his politics.</p> \n<p>So we decided to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2019/jan/28/orban-my-dad-and-me-video\" title=\"\">go on a road trip</a> together. We\u2019d spend seven days in a car, travelling across Hungary and its political spectrum to have it all out. What could possibly go wrong?</p> \n<p>Hungary has been in the news a lot recently (nobody cared about it for years). Orb\u00e1n has set about building what he calls an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/15/democracy-authoritarianism-media-spotlight-viktor-orban\" title=\"\">illiberal democracy</a>\u201d and leading a nationalist surge in May\u2019s European parliamentary elections. This winter there have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/18/hungary-opposition-plans-more-protests-after-slave-law-passes-viktor-orban\" title=\"\">opposition protests</a> on the streets. The battle lines are clear to many commentators: on the one side are the nationalists/populist right/far right; on the other, the liberals/federalists/globalists \u2013 choose your terms according to which side you\u2019re on.</p> \n<p>It was this political faultline we set off to explore as the Hungarian winter set in last year. We planned our journey to take us through symbolic parts of Hungary\u2019s history and present: a commemoration of the Hungarian revolution of 1956 (against the communist dictatorship), a formative event for both my father, who remembers being locked in a cellar as a frightened six-year-old, and modern Hungary; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wik\" title=\"\">Miskolc</a>, a post-industrial city that exemplifies the lack of economic progress since the fall of communism in 1989; and back to the rural roots of our family, and the bedrock of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s support.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/21/hungary-pithy-insult-dogs-orban-as-anti-government-protesters-resort-to-ridicule\">Hungary: pithy insults fly as anti-Orb\u00e1n protesters resort to ridicule</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was not difficult to find evidence of the fear about national identity that many on the left now find so alarming. It was there in the mayor I met, from Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party, determined to \u201cdream big\u201d from his small southern village. It was there in the young man who had worked in supermarkets and kitchens in England, but returned home to answer an \u201cinner calling\u201d. It was even clearer when we travelled deep into Romania, and met ethnic Hungarians keeping alive their traditions \u2013 threatened first by the redrawing of national borders that was a feature of 20th-century central Europe and now, they felt, by globalisation. But I also saw it among passionate housing activists protesting against Orb\u00e1n. And in two young female artists who had moved back to Miskolc in the hope of sparking cultural regeneration.</p> \n<p>By no means were all these people either devoted fans of Orb\u00e1n or his version of nationalism, or opposed to him. Hungary can feel like a very divided place, yet so many of the people we met along the way had more in common than they might imagine.

I learned how much history matters in shaping those hopes \u2013 and fears.

It brought home to me how the binary way we increasingly talk about politics is destructive and counterproductive. I often felt put in a box by my father as an \u201corthodox liberal with no sense of patriotism\u201d. I didn\u2019t realise how much I had done the same to him.

And it was enjoyable - a guilty pleasure for the most part. Granted, sometimes his style reads a little like Enid Blyton with sexy bits, but there were various parts of it that were fairly compelling. You know - pageturnery. It was all a touch redolent of faux-intellectualism with its scattergun intertextuality and self-conscious exploration of the boundaries and ambivalences between dream and reality, symbols and tangibles, and space and time, but again, I found myself not really caring all that much\u2026</p> <p>There\u2019s plenty more to say, but I\u2019ll try and keep it brief.

The novel and life. Didn\u2019t like anything else I\u2019ve read of his since very much, so wasn\u2019t sure how going back to it would be. And it was enjoyable - a guilty pleasure for the most part. Granted, sometimes his style reads a little like Enid Blyton with sexy bits, but there were various parts of it that were fairly compelling. You know - pageturnery. It was all a touch redolent of faux-intellectualism with its scattergun intertextuality and self-conscious exploration of the boundaries and ambivalences between dream and reality, symbols and tangibles, and space and time, but again, I found myself not really caring all that much\u2026 There\u2019s plenty more to say, but I\u2019ll try and keep it brief. I think David Mitchell divided the readers of this novel into three groups: the fanboys and girls, the critically approving, and the skeptics. I\u2019m in the middle, I reckon. Anyone else? An always fascinating question. Interesting links about books and reading \u201cWhat a good, wise and witty companion Jan Morris has been for so many readers for so long.\u201d Alexander McCall Smith on the great Jan Morris and her new book. Boyd Tonkin celebrates Polish short stories. Britain\u2019s ongoing tragedy could be Ireland\u2019s artistic gain. On Beckett\u2019s political imagination.

That message was hammered home again today as the latest exporters\u2019 sentiment index from the German IFO institute fell again in January. Although not a particularly closely watched indicator, the fall in German exporters\u2019 business confidence has been precipitous, with the index now only a whisker above its lowest level since October 2012.</p> <p>Perhaps more encouragingly, the latest eurozone M3 money supply numbers continue to point to a steady flow in new lending to the household sector, especially for mortgages. Combined with stronger wages and lower inflation, we continue to think that a marked increase in consumer spending power will to some extent offset the weakness in external demand. </p> <p>Concerns that the global economy might be falling into a recession, fuelled by continued trade tensions between the United States and China, have so far this year largely vanquished any notion that European activity might rebound after a particularly weak fourth quarter. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c4ee3f2e4b0a585f6e87e4a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-28T11:17:10.251Z\">11.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Chinese growth is slowing but no more than expected, say fund managers interviewed by the Association of Investment Companies.</strong></p> <p>Dale Nicholls, portfolio manager of Fidelity China Special Situations,<strong> </strong>said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>China is facing a slowdown, but this is already well documented and the growth rates in China remain the envy of most economies. The authorities\u2019 focus on deleverage has been the main catalyst for a slowdown as this has impacted access to funding and subsequently impacted business and consumer confidence. </p> <p>There has been a slowdown in the rate of growth of consumption, particularly in larger durable goods such as cars. This has not been helped by falling markets and the sense that house prices have peaked. However, retail sales are still showing high single digit year-on-year growth despite the decline in car sales and, even with a general economic slowdown, the medium-term prospects for earnings growth remain strong.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong> </strong>Mike Kerley, fund manager of Henderson Far East Income, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Chinese growth is slowing although not by more than we would have expected. The rising base ensures that the growth of the past cannot be repeated, while the reforms of state-owned enterprises and the clampdown on non-bank credit will put pressure on growth in the short to medium term. </p> <p>These headwinds are being offset by measures to promote consumer spending and by tax cuts to corporates and individuals. This should be seen as a positive as the government pursues a policy of sustainability, rather than the old model of pump priming through debt-funded investment. Ultimately, the quantity of growth may slow but the quality will improve.</p> </blockquote> <p>Robin Parbrook, fund manager of Schroder Asian Total Return,<a> </a>said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The scope for China to undertake major stimulus measures is now much more limited \u2013 unless they wish to suspend the effective renminbi peg.

As highlighted several times last year, it is clear that US-China tensions are not just about trade, but something much bigger.

However, the political dimension means we do not have strong conviction. We do think that domestic Chinese equities have discounted a very pessimistic outcome: both a trade war and growth slowdown. Consequently, we are beginning to see value in several areas of the A-share market.

However, this disruption may have unexpected benefits for certain regional economies.

But there was little progress on these issues at a round of talks among mid-level officials in Beijing earlier in January. Instead, Chinese officials offered to substantially increase purchases of US products. </p> <p><strong>Will US officials accept a deal based mainly on purchases? </strong>Trump has been optimistic about a deal, saying a weakening Chinese economy gives Beijing incentive to negotiate. But the president\u2019s advisers say that he will not soften his demands that China make structural reforms on IP and related issues... A key US demand is creating a mechanism for regular reviews of China\u2019s progress on following through on any reform pledges that it makes, a plan that would maintain a perpetual threat of US tariffs. </p> <p><strong>What are possible outcomes of this week\u2019s talks? </strong>The two sides could report some progress towards a deal though another stalemate on core structural issues would be viewed as a negative sign for a deal by March, and investors would brace for higher tariffs. But trade negotiations often go down to the wire, so a final outcome is not likely before the end of February.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f851fea7b701a0ee75b1cd7b6da70c975cafd5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f851fea7b701a0ee75b1cd7b6da70c975cafd5b/0_284_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US president Donald Trump and China\u2019s president Xi Jinping leaving a business leaders event at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing in November 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US president Donald Trump and China\u2019s president Xi Jinping leaving a business leaders event at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing in November 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-28T09:47:16.163Z\">at 9.47am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c4ec073e4b024f0efeafe9a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-28T08:52:20.455Z\">8.52am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Explainer on trade talks (part 1)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-explainer/explainer-key-issues-implications-of-u-s-china-trade-talks-idUKKCN1PM0ES\">Reuters</a> has done a useful explainer on the trade negotiations. The two sides are trying to resolve deep differences over China\u2019s trade and intellectual property practices, industrial subsidies and market access \u2013 to ward off an increase in US tariffs on Chinese goods on 2 March. </p> <p><strong>What are Washington and Beijing fighting about?</strong> After years of steadily rising US trade deficits with China and US complaints that Beijing has systematically obtained American intellectual property (IP) and trade secrets through coercion and outright theft, the Trump administration last year demanded fundamental changes to China\u2019s economic model to allow US companies to compete on a more level playing field. These include an end to policies that Washington claims effectively force US firms to transfer their technologies to Chinese partners and full protection for US IP rights. <br></p> <p><strong> What\u2019s at stake in these talks?</strong> At the most basic level, a dominant position in future high-technology industries, according to the US Trade Representative\u2019s office. China is determined to upgrade its industrial base in 10 strategic sectors by 2025, including aerospace, robotics, semiconductors, artificial intelligence and new-energy vehicles.</p> <p><strong> How does Beijing view these complaints?</strong> Chinese officials generally view the US actions as a broad effort to thwart China\u2019s inevitable rise to a dominant position in the global economy. They deny that China requires or coerces technology transfers... At the same time, China is looking to make a deal with Trump to ease US tariffs on Chinese goods and to directly reduce the trade imbalance through increased purchases of US goods, including soybeans and energy. </p> <p><strong>What actions has the US taken?</strong> Donald Trump has imposed punitive tariffs on $250bn worth of imported goods from China so far - a 25% duty on $50bn worth of machinery, semiconductors and other technology-related products, and 10% tariffs on a broader, $200bn range of goods... Thus far, Trump has spared many consumer goods including cell phones, computers, clothing and footwear from tariffs. But if no deal is reached by 2 March, Trump has threatened to impose new tariffs on about $267bn worth of goods. <br></p> <p><strong>Has China retaliated?</strong> Yes. China has imposed tariffs of 25% on $50bn worth of US goods, including soybeans, beef, pork, seafood, whiskey, ethanol and motor vehicles. Beijing also has imposed tariffs of 5% to 10% on another $60bn worth of US goods, including liquefied natural gas, chemicals, frozen vegetables and food ingredients... Since Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping agreed in December to pursue the current round of talks, China has suspended tariffs on US-made autos and has resumed some purchases of US soybeans. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fe7679c3d54412c9ac4d61c5cadf42036caff50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fe7679c3d54412c9ac4d61c5cadf42036caff50/0_74_4500_2699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Starkey offloads soybeans from his combine as he harvests his crops in Brownsburg, Indiana.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Starkey offloads soybeans from his combine as he harvests his crops in Brownsburg, Indiana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Conroy/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-28T09:48:26.580Z\">at 9.48am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c4ebf88e4b024f0efeafe94\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-28T08:42:22.509Z\">8.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All the big European indices were lower on Monday after a firm rally on Friday ran out of steam.

Asian, European and US stocks have drifted lower as investors remain nervous ahead of high-level trade talks between the US and China, due to start in Washington on Wednesday. The US Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at the end of its two-day meeting, also on Wednesday. FTSE 100 index down 0.8% at 6754.47 Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.5% at 11,221.12 France\u2019s CAC down 0.7% at 4889.63 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.9% at 19,631.22 Spain\u2019s Ibex down 1.3% at 9066.10 Dow Jones down 1.2% at 24,436.37 Nasdaq down 1.6% at 6680.31 S&amp;P 500 down 1.1% at 2634.64 Sterling has weakened ahead of tomorrow\u2019s key Brexit vote in parliament. It is down 0.37% against the dollar at $1.3155 and down 0.4% against the euro at 86.84 pence. Retail bosses have warned the government that a no deal Brexit would result in significant disruption to food supplies, leading to shortages and price rises. And Tesco has confirmed that up to 9,000 jobs are at risk as it closes fresh food counters in about 90 of its stores, as well as some staff canteens, and makes cuts at its head office. Here is our full story. Tesco shares have fallen 2.6% on news of its latest cost-cutting drive which will lead to up to 9,000 job losses at its supermarkets and head office. Britain\u2019s biggest retailer plans to shut around 90 fresh food counters. On Wall Street, stocks have opened lower, mirroring declines in Europe. Dow Jones down 1.1% at 24,462 S&amp;P 500 down 0.95% at 2639 Nasdaq down 1.27% at 7073 Tesco said customers use fresh food counters less than they used to. The remaining 700 large stores will retain their counters or operate them on a \u201cflexible\u201d basis, i.e. with reduced opening hours. Some of the cuts will also affect the company\u2019s head office in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire. Jason Tarry, chief executive of its UK &amp; Ireland business, said: In our four years of turnaround we\u2019ve made good progress, but the market is challenging and we need to continually adapt to remain competitive and respond to how customers want to shop. We\u2019re making changes to our UK stores and head office to simplify what we do and how we do it, so we\u2019re better able to meet the needs of our customers. This will impact some of our colleagues and our commitment is to minimise this as much as possible and support our colleagues throughout. Tesco is embarking on a fresh round of aggressive cost-cutting in its UK supermarket business and around 90 stores will close their in-store deli counters. The retailer said it hoped to redeploy up to half of the staff affected into other customer service roles. NEWS FLASH: Tesco has just announced that up to 9,000 people could be laid off as a result of restructuring. Leading retail bosses including the chief executives of Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda, Marks &amp; Spencer, The Co-op and Waitrose have written to the government warning of significant disruption to food supplies in the event of a no deal Brexit, our retail correspondent Sarah Butler writes. The letter, signed by 11 retail CEOs and the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, also warns that grocery prices are likely to rise as a nearly a third of food we eat comes from the EU and would be subject to import tariffs if the UK exits by its self-imposed 29 March deadline without a trade deal in place. The UK could set import tariffs at zero but that would have a devastating impact on our own farmers, a key part of our supply chains,\u201d the letter warns. We are extremely concerned that our customers will be among the first to experience the realities of a no deal Brexit. We anticipate significant risks to maintaining the choice, quality and durability of food that our customers have come to expect in our stores, and there will be inevitable pressure on food prices from higher transport costs, currency devaluation and tariffs. The letter raises particular concern about fresh foods saying it is \u201cimpossible to stockpile fresh produce, such as salad leaves and fresh fruit\u201d and that 90% of lettuces, 80% of tomatoes and 70% of soft fruit is imported from the EU in March, when the UK is currently set to exit the EU. The letter says retailers typically store no more than two weeks\u2019 of stocks. \u201cAs prudent businesses\u201d they are stockpiling in order to be prepared for a no deal but frozen and chilled storage is nearing capacity and there is very little general warehousing space available in the UK. While we have been working closely with our suppliers on contingency plans it is not possible to mitigate all the risks to our supply chains and we fear significant disruption in the short term as a result if there is no Brexit deal. The letter warns there will be \u201cmajor disruption\u201d at Calais, a key route for food imports to the UK, potentially reducing freight trade by nearly 90% as the French government has said it will enforce sanitary and customs checks on exports from the EU, measures which will cause long delays. Crude oil prices have fallen today, after American companies added new oil rigs for the first time this year, but crude remains on track for its biggest January gain for 14 years. The US-China trade war and its impact on the Chinese economy also weighs on oil prices. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell nearly $1, or 1.6%, to $60.66, while US futures lost $1.03 to $52.66, a 1.9% drop. US energy companies last week increased the number of rigs searching for new oil for the first time since late December, to 862, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday. Amundi, Europe\u2019s largest fund manager with \u20ac1.45 trillion of assets under management, believes that the world economy can avoid a recession. No global recession in store: An excess of pessimism naturally results in a decline in the financial markets and renewed volatility. Based on our calculations, market participants priced in twice the slowdown risk that economic fundamentals justified. The market went too far in December, pricing in a recession, and while we think risks are skewed to the downside, we have a more balanced view. Except in the case of an extreme shock, nothing leads us to bet on a recession in Europe or the United States for the next 18-24 months. We are more inclined towards convergence towards potential growth, with a second half of the year that is more favourable than the first. The reporting season has to be closely monitored as it will likely shed some more light from a micro fundamentals perspective. We expect sliding revenues as diminished global trade is already translating into lower sales (in the manufacturing and wholesale sectors in particular). Greece is preparing to issue a new five-year bond \u2013 its first attempt to tap financial markets since the country emerged from its third international bailout programme since 2010 last August, Reuters is reporting. The bond issue will be launched \u201cin the near future, subject to market conditions,\u201d the Greek authorities said in a bourse filing. Oxford Economics have sent us their thoughts on the eurozone and global economic slowdown. James Nixon, the consultancy\u2019s head of macro forecasting for EMEA, says: Recent European data has been unremittingly poor, as a slowdown in external demand remains a significant drag on the continent\u2019s manufacturing sector. That message was hammered home again today as the latest exporters\u2019 sentiment index from the German IFO institute fell again in January. Although not a particularly closely watched indicator, the fall in German exporters\u2019 business confidence has been precipitous, with the index now only a whisker above its lowest level since October 2012. Perhaps more encouragingly, the latest eurozone M3 money supply numbers continue to point to a steady flow in new lending to the household sector, especially for mortgages. Combined with stronger wages and lower inflation, we continue to think that a marked increase in consumer spending power will to some extent offset the weakness in external demand. Concerns that the global economy might be falling into a recession, fuelled by continued trade tensions between the United States and China, have so far this year largely vanquished any notion that European activity might rebound after a particularly weak fourth quarter. Chinese growth is slowing but no more than expected, say fund managers interviewed by the Association of Investment Companies. Dale Nicholls, portfolio manager of Fidelity China Special Situations, said: China is facing a slowdown, but this is already well documented and the growth rates in China remain the envy of most economies. The authorities\u2019 focus on deleverage has been the main catalyst for a slowdown as this has impacted access to funding and subsequently impacted business and consumer confidence. There has been a slowdown in the rate of growth of consumption, particularly in larger durable goods such as cars. This has not been helped by falling markets and the sense that house prices have peaked. However, retail sales are still showing high single digit year-on-year growth despite the decline in car sales and, even with a general economic slowdown, the medium-term prospects for earnings growth remain strong. Mike Kerley, fund manager of Henderson Far East Income, said: Chinese growth is slowing although not by more than we would have expected. The rising base ensures that the growth of the past cannot be repeated, while the reforms of state-owned enterprises and the clampdown on non-bank credit will put pressure on growth in the short to medium term. These headwinds are being offset by measures to promote consumer spending and by tax cuts to corporates and individuals. This should be seen as a positive as the government pursues a policy of sustainability, rather than the old model of pump priming through debt-funded investment. Ultimately, the quantity of growth may slow but the quality will improve. Robin Parbrook, fund manager of Schroder Asian Total Return, said: The scope for China to undertake major stimulus measures is now much more limited \u2013 unless they wish to suspend the effective renminbi peg. We expect the Chinese economy to continue to slow in 2019 as a result of the authorities\u2019 desire to rein in excessive leverage and bring shadow banking back to balance sheets. Given the pegged currency, a current account no longer in surplus and a leaky capital account, we view the monetary options as limited assuming devaluation is not considered an option - this would cause market chaos and global deflation. The latest round of high-level US-China trade negotiations, which kick off in Washington on Wednesday when Beijing\u2019s vice premier Liu He\u2019s delegation arrives, come before the start of Chinese New Year next Tuesday, ushering in the Year of the Pig. So how are China-focused fund managers viewing the threat of trade wars, the current state of the Chinese economy and the prospects for their investments? The Association of Investment Companies has spoken to some of them. Robin Parbrook, fund manager of Schroder Asian Total Return, said: We remain sceptical of any real let-up in US and China tensions despite Trump\u2019s suggestions that a deal will be completed. As highlighted several times last year, it is clear that US-China tensions are not just about trade, but something much bigger. It involves US perceptions around China\u2019s intellectual property theft, cybercrime, the way China projects its political and financial power via One Belt One Road and China\u2019s desire to dominate key industries via massive state subsidies through Made in China 2025. Howard Wang, fund manager of JPMorgan Chinese said: We should see a resolution on tariffs as it is in the interest of both parties. However, the political dimension means we do not have strong conviction. We do think that domestic Chinese equities have discounted a very pessimistic outcome: both a trade war and growth slowdown. Consequently, we are beginning to see value in several areas of the A-share market. Whatever the outcome of current negotiations we believe China and the US will increasingly compete in areas of technological innovation from electric vehicles to artificial intelligence. Suresh Withana, managing partner of Harmony Capital, the investment manager of Adamas Finance Asia, said: At a macro level, the trade war between the US and China has the potential to cause continued, serious, short-term global disruption. However, this disruption may have unexpected benefits for certain regional economies. For instance, companies may seek to shift production from China to other Asian countries. Furthermore, if volatility in public markets continues to prevail, we would expect to see both Chinese and Asian SMEs increasing their reliance on private financing sources as they will still require capital to fund ongoing regional growth opportunities. We believe the most exciting investment areas will be those driven by intra-Asian consumption. Cash remains king among rich investors, despite low interest rates, new research from Rathbone Investment Management shows. A quarter of high-net worth investors \u2013 those with more than \u00a3100,000 in investable assets \u2013 currently hold more than half of their wealth in cash, despite interest rates for savings remaining low. A quarter keep over half of their wealth in cash while a further 35% of HNW investors keep at least 26-50% of their savings in cash. One of the key reasons why HNW investors choose to hold their wealth in cash is because they believe it\u2019s be the safest option. However, due to the low interest rate environment and high inflation, leaving too much money in cash means its value could be eroded over time. Regular investors \u2013 those with \u00a31,000-\u00a3100,000 in investable assets \u2013 are also heavily reliant on cash savings. 46% of investors keep more than half of their wealth in cash savings, and 20% keep 25-50% of their wealth in cash. Robert Szechenyi, investment director at Rathbones, says: Cash remains king as investors remain cautious. Despite the threat of low interest rates devaluing their wealth over the long term, investors still believe cash to be the safest option for their money. This is largely down to the economic and political uncertainty currently at play in the UK and wider afield. Investors are concerned about the impact that impending events such as Brexit will have on the markets and therefore are hesitant to invest a significant proportion of their wealth into the markets. The Financial Conduct Authority is consulting on measures to stop up to 100,000 people a year losing out on pension income when they access the pension freedoms. The City watchdog has previously expressed concern about consumers moving into drawdown and holding their funds in investments that will not meet their needs. The FCA is proposing that firms offer customers who do not take advice a range of investment solutions that broadly meet their objectives, known as \u2018investment pathways\u2019. The FCA is also proposing that consumers\u2019 pension investments are not defaulted into cash savings unless the customer picks this option. The watchdog is also announcing new rules on the \u2018wake up packs\u2019 that must be given to consumers as they approach retirement, and on the disclosure of charges by pension providers. Christopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said: The pension freedoms give consumers more flexibility in how and when they can access their pension savings; but that also means they have to make more complicated choices. Our Retirement Outcomes Review identified that many consumers are focused only on taking their tax-free cash and take the \u2018path of least resistance\u2019 when entering drawdown. This can often mean that the rest of their drawn down pension pot is not invested in a way that meets their needs and intentions. We found that around one in three consumers who have gone into drawdown recently are unaware of where their money is being invested. Our proposals on investment pathways will help non-advised drawdown consumers select from four relatively simple choices, designed to meet their broad retirement objectives so that they can maximise their income in retirement. The FCA estimates these changes could benefit people by up to \u00a325m a year. Unite, Britain\u2019s biggest union, is calling for urgent talks with Tesco bosses, following reports that Britain\u2019s largest retailer wants to axe up to 15,000 jobs. Unite has 1,000 members at four Tesco distribution centres, at Belfast, Didcot (Oxfordshire), Doncaster and Thurrock in Essex. Unite national officer for retail distribution Adrian Jones said: Our top priority this week is to arrange a meeting with Tesco\u2019s management to get a clear picture of what the supermarket is planning. This is a very worrying time for our members who deliver to Tesco stores across the UK. While the reports centre on job losses in-store, such as at the bakeries and deli counters, we still need to know what this could mean for our members. We will be giving our members, who are employed directly by Tesco, maximum support in the days and weeks ahead. The FTSE 100 index briefly ventured into positive territory before slipping back into the red and is now down 0.01% at 6860.19. Traders are waiting for the latest round of trade talks between Beijing and Washington, due to start on Wednesday, and the outcome of the Fed\u2019s monthly policy meeting on the same day. Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.22% France\u2019s CAC down 0.34% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.22% Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.08% Asian stock markets were also lower, after data showed China\u2019s industrial profits shrank for a second month in December. The pound has lost 0.36% against the dollar this morning, dropping to $1.3158, and has fallen 0.26% against the euro to 86.69 pence. It\u2019s an important week for Brexit, as MPs prepare to vote on amendments to Theresa May\u2019s deal tomorrow. Most of the UK\u2019s most popular cars are at risk of theft using technology that exploits keyless entry, according to the consumer group Which?. The Ford Fiesta, Volkswagen Golf, Nissan Qashqai and Ford Focus \u2013 four of the top five models sold in the UK \u2013 are among the popular cars that are susceptible to theft using \u201ccheap electronic equipment bought online\u201d. Explainer continued \u2013 courtesy of Reuters. What has happened in the trade talks so far? In Buenos Aires in December, presidents Trump and Xi agreed to negotiate over structural issues, including \u201cforced technology transfer, intellectual property protection, non-tariff barriers, cyber intrusions and cyber theft, services and agriculture\u201d. But there was little progress on these issues at a round of talks among mid-level officials in Beijing earlier in January. Instead, Chinese officials offered to substantially increase purchases of US products. Will US officials accept a deal based mainly on purchases? Trump has been optimistic about a deal, saying a weakening Chinese economy gives Beijing incentive to negotiate. But the president\u2019s advisers say that he will not soften his demands that China make structural reforms on IP and related issues... A key US demand is creating a mechanism for regular reviews of China\u2019s progress on following through on any reform pledges that it makes, a plan that would maintain a perpetual threat of US tariffs. What are possible outcomes of this week\u2019s talks? The two sides could report some progress towards a deal though another stalemate on core structural issues would be viewed as a negative sign for a deal by March, and investors would brace for higher tariffs. But trade negotiations often go down to the wire, so a final outcome is not likely before the end of February. Reuters has done a useful explainer on the trade negotiations. The two sides are trying to resolve deep differences over China\u2019s trade and intellectual property practices, industrial subsidies and market access \u2013 to ward off an increase in US tariffs on Chinese goods on 2 March. What are Washington and Beijing fighting about? After years of steadily rising US trade deficits with China and US complaints that Beijing has systematically obtained American intellectual property (IP) and trade secrets through coercion and outright theft, the Trump administration last year demanded fundamental changes to China\u2019s economic model to allow US companies to compete on a more level playing field. These include an end to policies that Washington claims effectively force US firms to transfer their technologies to Chinese partners and full protection for US IP rights. What\u2019s at stake in these talks? At the most basic level, a dominant position in future high-technology industries, according to the US Trade Representative\u2019s office. China is determined to upgrade its industrial base in 10 strategic sectors by 2025, including aerospace, robotics, semiconductors, artificial intelligence and new-energy vehicles. How does Beijing view these complaints? Chinese officials generally view the US actions as a broad effort to thwart China\u2019s inevitable rise to a dominant position in the global economy. They deny that China requires or coerces technology transfers... At the same time, China is looking to make a deal with Trump to ease US tariffs on Chinese goods and to directly reduce the trade imbalance through increased purchases of US goods, including soybeans and energy. What actions has the US taken? Donald Trump has imposed punitive tariffs on $250bn worth of imported goods from China so far - a 25% duty on $50bn worth of machinery, semiconductors and other technology-related products, and 10% tariffs on a broader, $200bn range of goods... Thus far, Trump has spared many consumer goods including cell phones, computers, clothing and footwear from tariffs. But if no deal is reached by 2 March, Trump has threatened to impose new tariffs on about $267bn worth of goods. Has China retaliated? Yes. China has imposed tariffs of 25% on $50bn worth of US goods, including soybeans, beef, pork, seafood, whiskey, ethanol and motor vehicles. Beijing also has imposed tariffs of 5% to 10% on another $60bn worth of US goods, including liquefied natural gas, chemicals, frozen vegetables and food ingredients... Since Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping agreed in December to pursue the current round of talks, China has suspended tariffs on US-made autos and has resumed some purchases of US soybeans. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, says: All the big European indices were lower on Monday after a firm rally on Friday ran out of steam. Pause for breath or just lack of conviction in any rally? The major indices continue to make new highs from the December troughs so at present it does rather appear momentum is to the upside, albeit the FTSE 100 is a notable underperformer compared with peers. It\u2019s of course a massive week for pound traders as the Brexit vote round two takes place on Tuesday. Expect some real volatility around the votes as we witnessed last time \u2013 there will be lots of noise. The price action in the spot market and markedly lower implied volatility in options looks a little complacent as the clock is still ticking and the closer we get to March 29th without agreement the higher the risk of a no-deal, albeit parliament now has a chance to ensure this is taken off the table. The amendment to delay Brexit may pass, although there is not a guarantee that the EU would acquiesce. The stalemate will either force a no-deal or a General Election, possible followed by a second referendum. Turning to the latest round of US-China trade talks, due to begin on Wednesday, Wilson said: Equity markets are set for a big week as we look ahead to those talks. Both sides have reason to make a deal. However I would think that with Trump reopening the government after the shutdown, he is in a strong position than he otherwise might have been had the Federal government still been shut by the time the Chinese officials landed. The pound has fallen 0.3% against the dollar to $1.3162. Against the euro, it drifted 0.1% lower to 86.57 pence. It\u2019s another big week in Westminster: MPs will vote tomorrow on amendments to Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal deal with the EU. What is happening tomorrow and why is it important? Gold has slipped but remains near a seven-month peak, boosted by expectations that the US Federal Reserve will keep interest rates unchanged at this week\u2019s meeting, the first this year. The Fed lifted rates four times last year and has signalled two more hikes this year. Spot gold is trading around $1,301.14 per ounce, down 0.17% (following a 1.8% bounce on Friday), while US gold futures climbed 0.12% to $1,299.6 per ounce. The Fed starts its monthly meeting tomorrow and will announce its decision on Wednesday. Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to acknowledge growing risks to the US economy as the global outlook weakens. His counterpart at the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, warned last week that a dip in the eurozone\u2019s economy could deepen, suggesting that the Bank\u2019s first interest rate hike is some way off. Draghi will speak to the European parliament in Brussels later today. Germany\u2019s Dax, Spain\u2019s Ibex and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB have opened 0.4% lower while France\u2019s CAC is down 0.5%. The FTSE 100 index has opened 21 points lower at 6787.094, a 0.3% drop. Ocado is the main riser, up 6.5% at 999.5p, after it emerged that the online grocer has held secret talks with Marks &amp; Spencer over the launch of a food delivery service. Shares in M&amp;S are also up, by more than 2%. Ocado has had a tie-up with Waitrose for the last 20 years but the current supply deal ends in September 2020. City analysts expect the two businesses, which have always had a stormy relationship, to part ways. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The latest round of trade talks between the US and China begins in Washington this week, where a delegation led by Chinese vice premier Liu He is due to arrive on Wednesday. The talks will include discussions about China\u2019s currency practices, according to US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who will lead the American team along with US trade representative Robert Lighthizer. Mnuchin has criticised the yuan\u2019s weakness in the past, but in recent days optimism about the trade talks has boosted the yuan against the dollar. Asian shares gave up earlier gains to close lower. China\u2019s benchmark Shanghai Composite fell 0.18% while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng edged down 0.09% and South Korea\u2019s Kospi slipped 0.02%. Japan\u2019s Nikkei lost 0.6% while Australian markets were shut for Australia Day. The FTSE 100 index in London and other European markets are set to open lower. In the US, Donald Trump on Friday agreed to temporarily end the 35-day government shutdown, one of the longest in US history. The news sparked a rally on Wall Street on Friday as investors were relieved. The White House denied on Sunday that Donald Trump \u201ccaved\u201d to Democrats in reopening the federal government despite not receiving any funding for a border wall \u2013 a deal Trump had vowed he would never make. Also coming up this week The next key Brexit debate in the House of Commons happens tomorrow. The pound has made some gains over the past few weeks on hopes that a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit can be avoided. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: A lot of this still seems more like wishful thinking than anything else, given the parliamentary arithmetic, as well as the politics. Markets seem to have a lot more faith in politicians than many think they deserve, nonetheless the pound hit 18-month peaks against the euro on the basis that an article 50 extension could well find its way into an amendment when parliament meets to debate the latest attempt to break the deadlock over the UK\u2019s withdrawal agreement and political declaration tomorrow. The US Federal Reserve, America\u2019s central bank, holds its first policy meeting this year and is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at the end of its two-day meeting on Wednesday, after raising them five times.

Even the ranks of the Garrick Club could scarce forbear to cheer the sight of a team assembled under the banner of West Indies playing as if the maroon caps meant more to them than the gold necklaces. By finding two different ways to humiliate England with the ball in the space of a single match, they achieved something not even the greatest of their legendary predecessors could manage.</p> <p>In the first innings at the Kensington Oval the pace quartet of Kemar Roach, Shannon Gabriel, Jason Holder and Alzarri Joseph took all 10 wickets between them as England <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/24/west-indies-england-first-test-day-two-match-report\" title=\"\">calypso-collapsoed to 77 all out</a>, with Roach\u2019s five for 17 the pick of the bunch. Two days later it was Roston Chase, whose batting is the stronger element of his all-round talents, stepping up to flight his barely turning off-breaks through the defences of eight Englishmen while conceding 60 runs out of a total of 246.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/27/stuart-broad-return-england-twist-not-stick-second-test-west-indies\">Broad\u2019s return on the cards but England should twist not stick | Vic Marks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All of this brought memories rushing back, most immediately of the great Caribbean pace attacks. Those of us who saw Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith steaming in under the captaincies of Frank Worrell and Garry Sobers will never forget the sight of that intimidating muscularity. But in the following decade the threat was redoubled with the creation of the four-man unit: Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Joel Garner, and Colin Croft or Malcolm Marshall, whose relentless barrage of fireballs, varied in trajectory but not intensity, gave opposing batsmen no relief.</p> <p>On and off the field those fast bowlers had a presence that even retirement cannot diminish. One day during the Jamaican leg of England\u2019s 1993-94 tour there was a now-forgotten reason to spend a few off-duty hours in the pavilion at the Melbourne Cricket Club in Kingston, founded a hundred years earlier for men \u201cof modest means\u201d. A local league match was in progress. Suddenly the doors opened. Silhouetted against the light were the figures of Holding \u2013 who had begun his career there \u2013 and Roberts. It was several years since either man had last played Test cricket, but the effect was undimmed.

      "bodyText": "Is there a soul alive with an ounce of love for cricket who did not rejoice at the way the first Test in Bridgetown turned out? Even the ranks of the Garrick Club could scarce forbear to cheer the sight of a team assembled under the banner of West Indies playing as if the maroon caps meant more to them than the gold necklaces. By finding two different ways to humiliate England with the ball in the space of a single match, they achieved something not even the greatest of their legendary predecessors could manage. In the first innings at the Kensington Oval the pace quartet of Kemar Roach, Shannon Gabriel, Jason Holder and Alzarri Joseph took all 10 wickets between them as England calypso-collapsoed to 77 all out, with Roach\u2019s five for 17 the pick of the bunch. Two days later it was Roston Chase, whose batting is the stronger element of his all-round talents, stepping up to flight his barely turning off-breaks through the defences of eight Englishmen while conceding 60 runs out of a total of 246. All of this brought memories rushing back, most immediately of the great Caribbean pace attacks. Those of us who saw Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith steaming in under the captaincies of Frank Worrell and Garry Sobers will never forget the sight of that intimidating muscularity. But in the following decade the threat was redoubled with the creation of the four-man unit: Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Joel Garner, and Colin Croft or Malcolm Marshall, whose relentless barrage of fireballs, varied in trajectory but not intensity, gave opposing batsmen no relief. On and off the field those fast bowlers had a presence that even retirement cannot diminish. One day during the Jamaican leg of England\u2019s 1993-94 tour there was a now-forgotten reason to spend a few off-duty hours in the pavilion at the Melbourne Cricket Club in Kingston, founded a hundred years earlier for men \u201cof modest means\u201d. A local league match was in progress. Suddenly the doors opened. Silhouetted against the light were the figures of Holding \u2013 who had begun his career there \u2013 and Roberts. It was several years since either man had last played Test cricket, but the effect was undimmed. Had it been Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday coming through the swing doors of a saloon in Tombstone, Arizona in the 1880s, or Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker entering a 52nd Street club together in the late 1940s, the spine could not have experienced a more electrifying tingle. Roach and his colleagues lived up to that tradition on Thursday, succeeding without recourse to the near-sadistic physical aggression that characterised historic assaults on the sturdier defences of Brian Close, Geoff Boycott and Mike Atherton. On a pitch that was starting to offer them the encouragement their England counterparts had been unable to find the previous day, they performed with collective discipline as well as spirit. In some ways Chase\u2019s performance was even more remarkable. Back in 1950, Alf Valentine opened a series in England by taking eight for 104 at Old Trafford, and 12 years later Lance Gibbs\u2019s eight for 38 at Bridgetown gave West Indies the third win in a five-match clean sweep against India. Valentine, his pal Sonny Ramadhin and Gibbs were indisputably great spin bowlers, but who followed them? It would be hard to make a claim for inclusion in that category on behalf of Roger Harper, Carl Hooper, Jimmy Adams, Dinanath Ramnarine, Sulieman Benn or Devendra Bishoo, despite the last-named\u2019s eight for 49 against Pakistan in 2016. Chase might never again come close to his figures on Saturday, but the statistics put his feat into perspective. Perhaps Boycott\u2019s characterisation of West Indies as \u201cvery ordinary, average cricketers\u201d in his newspaper column on the eve of the match had something to do with the way they rose to the occasion. You\u2019d almost like to think so. His words were as witlessly provocative as Tony Greig\u2019s promise to make Clive Lloyd\u2019s team \u201cgrovel\u201d before the 1976 series defeat, or the assessment of Denesh Ramdin\u2019s 2015 team as \u201cmediocre\u201d by Colin Graves, the ECB chairman, in the lead-up to a series that ended all-square.

      "bodyText": "Pope Francis has said he fears bloodshed in Venezuela as the South American country braces for a week of fresh protests against its embattled president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Speaking on the papal plane as he returned from a five-day visit to Panama, Pope Francis told reporters: \u201cIn this moment, I support all the Venezuelan people because they are a people who are suffering. \u201cI suffer for what is happening in Venezuela,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat is it that scares me? Bloodshed.\u201d Pope Francis declined to publicly side with either Juan Guaid\u00f3, the opposition leader who last week declared himself Venezuela\u2019s rightful interim president, or Maduro, who has governed since being elected in the wake of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s 2013 death. Russia and China have backed the latter while the US, Canada and more than a dozen Latin American countries say they support Guaid\u00f3. EU countries including Britain, France, Germany and Spain on Saturday gave Maduro \u2013 who they say was fraudulently re-elected last May \u2013 an eight-day ultimatum to hold fresh election or they too would recognize Guaid\u00f3. \u201cIf I said, \u2018listen to these countries\u2019 or \u2018listen to those countries\u2019 I would put myself in a role that I do not know, it would be a pastoral imprudence on my part and I would cause damage,\u201d Pope Francis said. At a mass in Panama City attended by an estimated 700,000 on Sunday Pope Francis said he \u201casked the Lord to seek and find a just and peaceful solution to overcome the crisis that respects human rights and exclusively seeks the good of all people\u201d. Pope Francis is not alone in fearing violence in the oil-rich but economically devastated South American nation. \u201cI am worried about a country that can fragment under different chieftains and warlords and generals and narco-traffickers [and guerrilla groups] and \u2026 Venezuela becoming like a tapestry of different power centres,\u201d the country\u2019s former trade minister, Mois\u00e9s Na\u00edm, told the Guardian last week. Eric Farnsworth, a former US diplomat and vice-president of the Council of the Americas, said: \u201cI think there is potential for actual chaos on the ground. \u201cThings on the ground have been very bad. Citizens have been leaving. But what we haven\u2019t seen is a breakdown of civil authority \u2026 I think you could have security forces fighting each other. You could have further street protest and I think we have to be very mindful that Caracas \u2013 where everybody is focused \u2013 that is only one part of the country. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to commit at this stage that [civil war] is where Venezuela is heading but I think that is one possible scenario,\u201d Farnsworth added. However, in an interview with the Guardian, Guaid\u00f3 played down those fears. \u201cI don\u2019t think we will reach that point. The idea is to increase pressure,\u201d he said. On Monday activists said at least 44 people had already been killed by security forces since Venezuela\u2019s latest political upheaval began one week ago. \u201cWhat we are witnessing today in Venezuela in terms of human rights is a horror,\u201d said Ana Leonor Acosta, a human rights lawyer, claiming \u201ca massacre\u201d was unfolding. Alfredo Romero, a prominent human rights defender who runs the Foro Penal group, said 850 protesters had been taken into detention since 21 January. Romero said they included 77 minors, some as young as 12. Addressing members of Venezuela\u2019s security forces at a press conference, the opposition lawmaker Delsa Sol\u00f3rzano said her message was: \u201cStop repressing. \u201cJoin democracy, put yourselves on the right side of history,\u201d Sol\u00f3rzano added.",

Let\u2019s put aside the fact there seems no clear parliamentary path to a second referendum at present (even if Jeremy Corbyn backed it, my Open Europe colleague Dominic Walsh believes it\u2019s well <a href=\"https://openeurope.org.uk/today/blog/crunching-the-numbers-is-there-a-parliamentary-majority-for-anything/\" title=\"\">short of a majority</a>). Let\u2019s assume the EU agreed to extend article 50 beyond June to make time for a referendum (something ex-European Council president Herman Van Rompuy and the European Parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt both <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guyverhofstadt/status/1086975258069008385\" title=\"\">oppose</a>). And let\u2019s assume the ballot paper offers a choice of leaving the EU with Theresa May\u2019s deal or remain (and so MPs have ensured no deal is not an option). Even if those hurdles were to be overcome, while some polls have shown small leads for remain, it\u2019s impossible to know which way a second referendum would go \u2013 a fact often overlooked by advocates of a so-called people\u2019s vote, who seem to forget that people voted the other way last time.</p> <p>Many Europeans may well be delighted if the UK voted to remain in a new referendum. Almost no one in the EU wanted Brexit, and many see in it a profound challenge to the project itself. There is a small contingent in Brussels who spied an opportunity to accelerate the path to closer union without the recalcitrant UK. But for most in EU institutions and member states, the reaction to the 2016 referendum was sorrow and disappointment.</p> <p>Yet there is concern among some members and in Brussels that if the UK voted to stay in after a second referendum, it could become a rather unstable member. There are worries there would be demands for yet another vote \u2013 a best of three. Or that a future government could simply take the UK out without a referendum at all (precisely what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/11/how-labours-2017-manifesto-compares-with-1983\" title=\"\">Labour\u2019s 1983 manifesto</a> committed to do, less than a decade after our 1975 referendum on membership). And above all there are major concerns about how the UK would behave in the EU, particularly if it was dealing with widespread domestic discord due to a perceived \u201cestablishment\u201d betrayal of Brexit.</p> <p>There are already jokes in Brussels that the UK could elect 73 Nigel Farages if it took part in the European elections in May. But if the UK voted narrowly to remain in the EU, what would its ministers do in the EU council? Some member states are worried we could become very difficult partners, adding to their existing problems with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2019/jan/28/orban-my-dad-and-me-video\" title=\"\">Hungary</a>, Poland and, to some extent, Italy.</p> <p>Of course, a second referendum could well go the same way as the first. And there\u2019s been much less focus given to this. On the continent, the dominant narrative is that voters were lied to in 2016 and the facts about Brexit have only become clear since. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/20/donald-tusk-demands-answer-to-irish-border-question-next-month\" title=\"\">President Macron put it</a> last September, Brexit was \u201ca choice pushed by those who predicted easy solutions \u2026 they are liars\u201d. He went on to warn: \u201cIt\u2019s not so easy to leave the EU.\u201d But if the UK voted again to leave, this argument would be holed below the waterline. And if the new remain campaign sought to focus on the benefits of EU membership rather than the economic risks of leaving, a new vote to leave would indicate a more definitive rejection. The campaign couldn\u2019t even rely on David Cameron\u2019s renegotiation \u2013 which fell away after the leave vote in 2016.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/28/labour-voters-leave-backing-referendum-vote\">My constituency voted to leave \u2013 but I\u2019m still backing another referendum | Bridget Phillipson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2016, Cameron\u2019s team were desperate to dissuade European figures from campaigning in Britain. Who could stop them this time? And it\u2019s not as if the public\u2019s image of Brussels has improved. From Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s bizarre <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/jean-claude-juncker-amber-rudd-uk-minister-hits-out-at-ghastly-over-hair-ruffling-incident/\" title=\"\">hair-flicking antics</a> to his <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/jean-claude-juncker-english-is-losing-importance/\" title=\"\">silly comments</a> that \u201cEnglish is losing importance\u201d in Europe, it would be easy to see how personal things could turn. Since the 2016 vote, we have also seen a series of demands for more European integration \u2013 including in areas such as defence \u2013 for which there is no UK appetite. And while there are a few impressive MPs pushing for a second vote, the danger is that a new remain campaign would be dominated by its highest-profile backer, Tony Blair \u2013 with all the baggage that he brings.</p> <p>A new referendum still doesn\u2019t seem likely. As a European diplomat put it to me, they are certainly \u201cnot putting their eggs\u201d in that basket. They\u2019re right not to \u2013 but not just because it seems unlikely. A second referendum would pose <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e3f3fc60-1b3d-11e9-9e64-d150b3105d21\" title=\"\">\u201cformidable risks\u201d</a> for the UK, but also for the EU. The EU can clearly weather Brexit, but a second referendum campaign would likely be far more damaging, whichever way it went. It offers no safe path out of the current impasse. And so, member states should reflect carefully on how best to address the concerns of parliamentarians about the current agreement and decide what concessions can be made to get this deal over the line.</p> <p>\u2022 Henry Newman is the director of Open Europe.

And let\u2019s assume the ballot paper offers a choice of leaving the EU with Theresa May\u2019s deal or remain (and so MPs have ensured no deal is not an option). Even if those hurdles were to be overcome, while some polls have shown small leads for remain, it\u2019s impossible to know which way a second referendum would go \u2013 a fact often overlooked by advocates of a so-called people\u2019s vote, who seem to forget that people voted the other way last time. Many Europeans may well be delighted if the UK voted to remain in a new referendum. Almost no one in the EU wanted Brexit, and many see in it a profound challenge to the project itself. There is a small contingent in Brussels who spied an opportunity to accelerate the path to closer union without the recalcitrant UK. But for most in EU institutions and member states, the reaction to the 2016 referendum was sorrow and disappointment. Yet there is concern among some members and in Brussels that if the UK voted to stay in after a second referendum, it could become a rather unstable member. There are worries there would be demands for yet another vote \u2013 a best of three. Or that a future government could simply take the UK out without a referendum at all (precisely what Labour\u2019s 1983 manifesto committed to do, less than a decade after our 1975 referendum on membership). And above all there are major concerns about how the UK would behave in the EU, particularly if it was dealing with widespread domestic discord due to a perceived \u201cestablishment\u201d betrayal of Brexit. There are already jokes in Brussels that the UK could elect 73 Nigel Farages if it took part in the European elections in May. But if the UK voted narrowly to remain in the EU, what would its ministers do in the EU council? Some member states are worried we could become very difficult partners, adding to their existing problems with Hungary, Poland and, to some extent, Italy. Of course, a second referendum could well go the same way as the first. And there\u2019s been much less focus given to this. On the continent, the dominant narrative is that voters were lied to in 2016 and the facts about Brexit have only become clear since. As President Macron put it last September, Brexit was \u201ca choice pushed by those who predicted easy solutions \u2026 they are liars\u201d. He went on to warn: \u201cIt\u2019s not so easy to leave the EU.\u201d But if the UK voted again to leave, this argument would be holed below the waterline. And if the new remain campaign sought to focus on the benefits of EU membership rather than the economic risks of leaving, a new vote to leave would indicate a more definitive rejection. The campaign couldn\u2019t even rely on David Cameron\u2019s renegotiation \u2013 which fell away after the leave vote in 2016. In 2016, Cameron\u2019s team were desperate to dissuade European figures from campaigning in Britain. Who could stop them this time? And it\u2019s not as if the public\u2019s image of Brussels has improved. From Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s bizarre hair-flicking antics to his silly comments that \u201cEnglish is losing importance\u201d in Europe, it would be easy to see how personal things could turn. Since the 2016 vote, we have also seen a series of demands for more European integration \u2013 including in areas such as defence \u2013 for which there is no UK appetite. And while there are a few impressive MPs pushing for a second vote, the danger is that a new remain campaign would be dominated by its highest-profile backer, Tony Blair \u2013 with all the baggage that he brings. A new referendum still doesn\u2019t seem likely. As a European diplomat put it to me, they are certainly \u201cnot putting their eggs\u201d in that basket. They\u2019re right not to \u2013 but not just because it seems unlikely. A second referendum would pose \u201cformidable risks\u201d for the UK, but also for the EU. The EU can clearly weather Brexit, but a second referendum campaign would likely be far more damaging, whichever way it went. It offers no safe path out of the current impasse. And so, member states should reflect carefully on how best to address the concerns of parliamentarians about the current agreement and decide what concessions can be made to get this deal over the line. \u2022 Henry Newman is the director of Open Europe.

Griffiths confirmed Cammaert, a retired Dutch general, was leaving after only weeks in the job, but said he had always been on a short-term contract and there had been no dispute between the two men after the general\u2019s convoy was fired upon in Hodeidah. Cammaert had been struggling to persuade the two sides to attend a regional coordination committee, seen as central to building trust, and ironing out disagreements over what was agreed in peace talks in Stockholm last month. Griffiths also rejected a call from the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis for the UN to declare the ceasefire is over. Such an announcement would be taken as a signal for the Saudi-backed forces to renew their offensive to capture the Houthi-held port city, seen by the Saudis as central to the Houthis\u2019 effort to remain in power in the populated north of the country.

The report called for funding from the national investment bank \u2013 a key plank of the opposition\u2019s economic strategy to be heavily skewed in favour of communities hard hit by the decline in manufacturing. It said funding by head in Wales and the north-east should be two and a half times that of London, which would should have the lowest per capita spending of any region. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, welcomed the report from a team from Sheffield Hallam University, which has published a series of studies into the problems of the older industrial areas and seaside towns. The report said Britain was a \u201cprofoundly unequal society\u201d, divided not just by class, gender and race but also by geography.

To dismantle something built up over 40 years is going to mean cost rises not just for shoppers on the island of Ireland, but across Great Britain.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen Kelly, the chief executive of Manufacturing NI, said the deal on the table was not perfect but businesses in Northern Ireland could live with it.</p> <p>\u201cOur business community, farming representatives, trade unions and voluntary sectors agree that the withdrawal agreement, whilst not perfect, is workable and much better than no deal, and its approval would secure the critical transition period, protect jobs and allow everyone to move to the more positive future relationship negotiations and agreement with the EU,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Connolly added: \u201cThe time for political games and brinkmanship has long passed. We can\u2019t sleepwalk into a no-deal Brexit, which will be a catastrophe for Northern Ireland business and for Northern Ireland households. We need a deal and the only deal on the table is May\u2019s deal, even if it means extra checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The alternative is fiscal chaos.\u201d</p> <p>The groups feel the level of understanding of Northern Ireland\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/13/northern-irish-farmers-brexit-enniskillen\">economy and society</a> is poor in some quarters in Westminster. They will point out 20% of food and animal products from Northern Ireland are consumed in the region, and 60% of the \u00a32.2bn of exports to Britain go through Dublin\u2019s port.</p> <p>Tariffs and the administrative costs of customs declarations when crossing the border would therefore hit British consumers in the pocket, with higher prices on everything from cheddar to Guinness.</p> <p>The cost of beef, lamb and chicken coming from one side of the border and processed on the other, including for sandwiches, ready meals and pizza toppings, could also rise.</p> <p>The groups have invited Northern Ireland\u2019s 18 MPs to meet them, including Democratic Unionist party members and the seven Sinn F\u00e9in elected representatives who do not take their seats in Westminster because of the party\u2019s abstentionist policy.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Leaders from Northern Ireland\u2019s business, farming and community groups have launched a last-ditch campaign to try to persuade opponents of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal and the Irish border backstop to reconsider. A group of 20 representatives from non-political organisations in Northern Ireland will meet politicians including Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn and Keir Starmer, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 Vince Cable and the Scottish National party\u2019s leader in the House of Commons, Ian Blackford. They will also meet the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, and hope to meet the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay. The leaders will argue a no-deal Brexit would lead to \u201cfiscal chaos\u201d in Northern Ireland and higher inflation on food exports from the region to British supermarkets. Aodh\u00e1n Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: \u201cThis is not just about the consumer in Northern Ireland, we are talking about the systematic dismantling of the Northern Ireland/Republic of Ireland supply chain. \u201cThat is going to hit Northern Ireland worst. To dismantle something built up over 40 years is going to mean cost rises not just for shoppers on the island of Ireland, but across Great Britain.\u201d Stephen Kelly, the chief executive of Manufacturing NI, said the deal on the table was not perfect but businesses in Northern Ireland could live with it. \u201cOur business community, farming representatives, trade unions and voluntary sectors agree that the withdrawal agreement, whilst not perfect, is workable and much better than no deal, and its approval would secure the critical transition period, protect jobs and allow everyone to move to the more positive future relationship negotiations and agreement with the EU,\u201d he said. Connolly added: \u201cThe time for political games and brinkmanship has long passed. We can\u2019t sleepwalk into a no-deal Brexit, which will be a catastrophe for Northern Ireland business and for Northern Ireland households. We need a deal and the only deal on the table is May\u2019s deal, even if it means extra checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The alternative is fiscal chaos.\u201d The groups feel the level of understanding of Northern Ireland\u2019s economy and society is poor in some quarters in Westminster. They will point out 20% of food and animal products from Northern Ireland are consumed in the region, and 60% of the \u00a32.2bn of exports to Britain go through Dublin\u2019s port. Tariffs and the administrative costs of customs declarations when crossing the border would therefore hit British consumers in the pocket, with higher prices on everything from cheddar to Guinness. The cost of beef, lamb and chicken coming from one side of the border and processed on the other, including for sandwiches, ready meals and pizza toppings, could also rise. The groups have invited Northern Ireland\u2019s 18 MPs to meet them, including Democratic Unionist party members and the seven Sinn F\u00e9in elected representatives who do not take their seats in Westminster because of the party\u2019s abstentionist policy.",

The Norwegian spruce saplings are now above waist height.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like my life grows with this yearly ritual. One year I\u2019m pregnant in the forest. The next year I have a child. It sort of snowballs with all the authors.\u201d Paterson is a member of the Future Library\u2019s board of trustees. Eventually she\u2019ll be replaced by a younger person. \u201cThe mandate is to compassionately sustain the artwork for its 100-year duration,\u201d she says. \u201cThe foresters have a big part to play, they tend to the trees. It\u2019s my dream project because it\u2019s got every aspect of what I like \u2013 the collaboration with authors, foresters and librarians. And it operates on slower time. It\u2019s not this rush to make something for a deadline. It\u2019s really nice to let something organically evolve.

We don\u2019t want to be putting more garbage in the sea.\u201d After the events, the pails will be composted by a farmer. \u201cI\u2019d like some of the soil back at the end,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Turner\u2019s been painting with the colours of the universe, without knowing. Or maybe he did</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the Margate show, the connection between a Romantic painter and a Scottish conceptual artist is not as tenuous as it might first appear. Turner was friends with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/nov/13/turner-science-sun\">Michael Faraday</a> and was deeply curious about science, geology and the natural world. Critics have noted that Paterson\u2019s work, like Turner\u2019s, raises Romantic questions of loss and reflects the awe and terror we feel when faced by the mighty universe.</p> <p>As Paterson installs her exhibition, new connections keep arising. Like Paterson, Turner kept a book of ideas and tried to create \u201cmoonlight\u201d through mixing paint. \u201cIn the beginning,\u201d she says, \u201cI would\u2019ve never had the audacity to exhibit with Turner works but, as it\u2019s gone on, interesting relationships have been opening up.\u201d When she first chose the Turner works, including many of his little-known sketches, \u201cit was like breathing the freshest air ever. His work was so shockingly beautiful. I hadn\u2019t had that experience before.\u201d</p> <p>The most serendipitous connection is visible in the gallery. A Turner sunset \u2013 chosen to represent her idea of \u201cVenus\u2019s sky recreated on Earth\u201d \u2013 perfectly matches the colours of the universe spinning on her wheel. \u201cI was so happy about that,\u201d she laughs. \u201cTurner\u2019s been painting with the colours of the universe, without knowing. Or maybe he did. Ultimately, we\u2019re all drawn to the unspeakable wonder of everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.turnercontemporary.org/exhibitions/katie-paterson-and-jmw-turner\">A Place that Exists Only in Moonlight: Katie Paterson and JMW Turner is at Turner Contemporary Margate</a>, 26 January to 6 May.</p>",

A new piece of writing about each place, from Orkney to Margate, will also be read out. \u201cIt is quite a small gesture,\u201d she says, \u201cyet it does connect the ephemeral to these vast mountains and the deep time of sand.\u201d The biggest challenge was making her mountain casts from compostable material. \u201cIt\u2019s been a complete nightmare but we got there in the end. We don\u2019t want to be putting more garbage in the sea.\u201d After the events, the pails will be composted by a farmer. \u201cI\u2019d like some of the soil back at the end,\u201d she says. At the Margate show, the connection between a Romantic painter and a Scottish conceptual artist is not as tenuous as it might first appear. Turner was friends with Michael Faraday and was deeply curious about science, geology and the natural world. Critics have noted that Paterson\u2019s work, like Turner\u2019s, raises Romantic questions of loss and reflects the awe and terror we feel when faced by the mighty universe. As Paterson installs her exhibition, new connections keep arising. Like Paterson, Turner kept a book of ideas and tried to create \u201cmoonlight\u201d through mixing paint. \u201cIn the beginning,\u201d she says, \u201cI would\u2019ve never had the audacity to exhibit with Turner works but, as it\u2019s gone on, interesting relationships have been opening up.\u201d When she first chose the Turner works, including many of his little-known sketches, \u201cit was like breathing the freshest air ever. His work was so shockingly beautiful. I hadn\u2019t had that experience before.\u201d The most serendipitous connection is visible in the gallery. A Turner sunset \u2013 chosen to represent her idea of \u201cVenus\u2019s sky recreated on Earth\u201d \u2013 perfectly matches the colours of the universe spinning on her wheel. \u201cI was so happy about that,\u201d she laughs. \u201cTurner\u2019s been painting with the colours of the universe, without knowing. Or maybe he did. Ultimately, we\u2019re all drawn to the unspeakable wonder of everything.\u201d \u2022 A Place that Exists Only in Moonlight: Katie Paterson and JMW Turner is at Turner Contemporary Margate, 26 January to 6 May.",

Speaking on Monday, Brady said this would give the prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/28/brexit-backstop-amendment-would-give-may-enormous-firepower\">\u201cenormous firepower\u201d</a>.</p> <p>May\u2019s spokesman declined to set out what changes might be sought to get a Brexit deal passed but he stressed the importance of addressing MPs\u2019 concerns on the backstop and dismissed reports that the prime minister could ease back on her Brexit \u201cred lines\u201d \u2013 thus placing a heavy emphasis on Brussels to yield.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is absolutely clear is that when parliament voted to reject the deal, and therefore the withdrawal agreement, the backstop was very significant among the concerns which were raised, and therefore we need to address those concerns if we to are get support for the deal,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat you have consistently heard from European leaders is that they want the United Kingdom to leave with a deal. I think there\u2019s recognition that the United Kingdom leaving with a deal is in their best interests as well as those of the UK.</p> <p>\u201cThe deal that has been agreed was defeated in parliament, so therefore if we are going to leave with a deal, clearly we are going to need to make some changes in order to win parliamentary support.\u201d</p> <p>The stage is thus set for a potential standoff between London and Brussels, with EU leaders equally insistent on the role of the backstop, which would keep Northern Ireland in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/21/no-say-on-trade-deals-for-uk-in-eu-customs-union-says-ex-wto-chief\">customs alignment</a> with the Irish Republic to avoid a hard border if there is not a permanent deal or other arrangement.</p> <p>If no agreement can be reached on the backstop, May will be left having to potentially put her deal to MPs again, with the only changes made to domestic issues, such as guarantees on workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections.</p> <p>The prime minister is committed to returning to the Commons for a second meaningful vote \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, her spokesman said.</p> <p>He denied May was trying to run down the clock to force the hands of MPs or the EU. \u201cWhat we\u2019re working to do is to secure a deal which parliament can support,\u201d the spokesman added.</p> <p>May is meeting Tory MPs and MEPs over the next couple of days, and is expected to make a statement to the Commons on the next steps after the votes on the amendments, whether that evening or the following day.</p> <p>Another amendment, tabled by the Labour MP Yvette Cooper, would oblige the government to extend the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/23/labour-whip-ready-back-yvette-cooper-no-deal-brexit-amendment\">Brexit deadline</a> if an agreement has not been struck by the end of next month.</p> <p>Nick Boles, the Tory backbencher who is pushing for the plan alongside Cooper, argued it was vital the amendment attracted enough support to be passed.</p> <p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t seize the moment tomorrow afternoon then we\u2019re at grave risk of just driving off the edge on 29 March, without really wanting to, and when there might be a compromise that we could achieve if we had a few more months,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Monday.</p> <p>It remains unclear whether either of these main amendments \u2013 or any of them \u2013 would be passed if they came to a vote.</p> <p>The Cooper plan has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/25/yvette-coopers-plan-to-see-off-no-deal-brexit-hangs-in-the-balance\">attracted scepticism</a> from some Labour MPs in leave-voting seats, who could potentially vote against it in sufficient numbers.</p> <p>It also remains to be seen whether Tory Eurosceptics consider Brady\u2019s proposal sufficiently robust to assuage their backstop fears.

However, only some amendments will be picked for a vote by the Speaker, John Bercow. Asked which ones the government might back, May\u2019s spokesman said it was impossible to say before they were selected. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see which amendments are chosen before any of those decisions can be taken,\u201d he said. The debate will take up most of Tuesday\u2019s Commons business. It will be opened by the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, and closed by May. There has been considerable focus on an amendment supported by the senior Conservative backbencher Graham Brady, which says the backstop should be replaced by \u201calternative arrangements to avoid a hard border\u201d. While this would have no force, and Ireland and the EU have stressed that such a change cannot happen, the hope among MPs backing the move is that if it were passed, it would give May a tangible sign to take to Brussels. Speaking on Monday, Brady said this would give the prime minister \u201cenormous firepower\u201d. May\u2019s spokesman declined to set out what changes might be sought to get a Brexit deal passed but he stressed the importance of addressing MPs\u2019 concerns on the backstop and dismissed reports that the prime minister could ease back on her Brexit \u201cred lines\u201d \u2013 thus placing a heavy emphasis on Brussels to yield. \u201cWhat is absolutely clear is that when parliament voted to reject the deal, and therefore the withdrawal agreement, the backstop was very significant among the concerns which were raised, and therefore we need to address those concerns if we to are get support for the deal,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you have consistently heard from European leaders is that they want the United Kingdom to leave with a deal. I think there\u2019s recognition that the United Kingdom leaving with a deal is in their best interests as well as those of the UK. \u201cThe deal that has been agreed was defeated in parliament, so therefore if we are going to leave with a deal, clearly we are going to need to make some changes in order to win parliamentary support.\u201d The stage is thus set for a potential standoff between London and Brussels, with EU leaders equally insistent on the role of the backstop, which would keep Northern Ireland in customs alignment with the Irish Republic to avoid a hard border if there is not a permanent deal or other arrangement. If no agreement can be reached on the backstop, May will be left having to potentially put her deal to MPs again, with the only changes made to domestic issues, such as guarantees on workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections. The prime minister is committed to returning to the Commons for a second meaningful vote \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, her spokesman said. He denied May was trying to run down the clock to force the hands of MPs or the EU. \u201cWhat we\u2019re working to do is to secure a deal which parliament can support,\u201d the spokesman added. May is meeting Tory MPs and MEPs over the next couple of days, and is expected to make a statement to the Commons on the next steps after the votes on the amendments, whether that evening or the following day. Another amendment, tabled by the Labour MP Yvette Cooper, would oblige the government to extend the Brexit deadline if an agreement has not been struck by the end of next month. Nick Boles, the Tory backbencher who is pushing for the plan alongside Cooper, argued it was vital the amendment attracted enough support to be passed. \u201cIf we don\u2019t seize the moment tomorrow afternoon then we\u2019re at grave risk of just driving off the edge on 29 March, without really wanting to, and when there might be a compromise that we could achieve if we had a few more months,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Monday. It remains unclear whether either of these main amendments \u2013 or any of them \u2013 would be passed if they came to a vote. The Cooper plan has attracted scepticism from some Labour MPs in leave-voting seats, who could potentially vote against it in sufficient numbers. It also remains to be seen whether Tory Eurosceptics consider Brady\u2019s proposal sufficiently robust to assuage their backstop fears. The European Research Group was due to meet on Monday afternoon to decide on a position.",

Scribbled in black pen on white cardboard and fixed to the fence by the stadium where long lines of tables were laid out and the atmosphere was building, it greeted them as they arrived \u2013 football fans heading to the biggest game of the year. Mostly, they strolled from town, through narrow, old streets, yellow ribbons attached to every lamppost, along the river where the houses overlooking the water are brightly coloured, not pastel, across the bridge and up a gentle hill in the sunshine. There, past concrete police controls was another sign, bigger and more professionally produced, yellow letters on a red backdrop covering the stand. \u201cOne team, one fanbase, one city,\u201d it declared.</p> \n<p>And that team, those fans, that city, was Girona. Not Miami.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jan/28/serie-as-weekend-of-thrills-topped-by-great-entertainers-atalanta-again\">Serie A's weekend of thrills topped by great entertainers Atalanta again | Paolo Bandini</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Three days after they had played Copa del Rey quarter-final first legs, three days before they play Copa del Rey quarter-final second legs, Girona were playing Barcelona in the league. This was <em>that</em> game: the one they had announced would be played in the USA, 7,586km away. But when the day arrived, Sunday 4.15pm local time, the thousands of fans making their way there headed along Avinguda Montilivi, not the Ronald Reagan Turnpike. This wasn\u2019t the Hard Rock Stadium, this was home: the city that provides the setting for Game of Thrones rather than Miami Vice and the ground embedded into the rocks out beyond the medieval maze. Leo Messi had come to town, their town, where he was whistled but where he won.</p> \n<p>And where Javier Tebas lost. The league\u2019s president is $10,000 poorer today, or he would have been if he\u2019d actually put his considerable money where his considerable mouth is. In an interview with CNN, Tebas had said: \u201cI bet you $10,000 that Girona-Barcelona gets played in Miami.\u201d Yet the day before the match, Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde grinned: \u201cIt\u2019s not in Miami? You don\u2019t say \u2026\u201d Two days before that, Girona manager Eusebio Sacristan had admitted he was as \u201chappy as could be\u201d that they were not about to board a plane <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/soccer/club/girona/9812/blog/post/3758889/girona-like-all-but-barca-and-madrid-cant-mortgage-la-liga-for-a-cup-run\">across the ocean</a>. And when kick-off came, Spain\u2019s catchiest club anthem boring its way into brains, it came in Catalonia.</p> \n<p>There were three days to go before the season started when, without warning or consultation, the league announced a \u20ac200m, 15-year development deal with Relevent that would include them taking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/16/la-liga-stage-match-us\">at least one game a season to the US</a>, starting in Miami, and three weeks after that it was revealed that the game chosen would be Girona-Barcelona.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIf the NBA and the NFL do it, why wouldn\u2019t we?\u201d Tebas said, as if they were the same thing. He insisted it would be good for the league, helping its growth, pushing into a key market. There were no figures presented to demonstrate how much of an impact a single game (for now) would make but the rationale was logical and the urgency was understandable: within La Liga, they were well aware of the strength of the Premier League, fearing it could eclipse all else. There was a sense that <em>something</em> had to be done; they had to try, at least. Besides, they reasoned, taking games abroad some day is inevitable, so they should get there first before all those other leagues did it.</p> \n<p>To start with the idea was welcomed; the doubts and debate came later. It was striking how quickly and easily it was accepted: there were few dissenting voices, no great outcry, no uprising, and in the press it was promoted, a project to get behind. Pretty much no one said much about the fans, but then pretty much no one ever does. Not much was said about the implications for the integrity of the competition either, until Julen Lopetegui raised it. The league said no clubs would be forced to go and plenty offered. Madrid refused. Barcelona and Girona agreed. For a club Girona\u2019s size, a fee of around \u20ac3m matters. Jaume Roures, board member and head of Mediapro who own the TV rights to La Liga, declared it would \u201cput Girona in the world\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jan/28/schalkes-fresh-bundesliga-start-stymied-after-bruising-trip-to-berlin\">Schalke\u2019s fresh Bundesliga start stymied after bruising trip to Berlin | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The date and time were announced four months in advance \u2013 which is three months and two weeks earlier than January\u2019s other games were announced and even then, some got changed later \u2013 and the league offered very attractive compensation packages for fans. Up to 1,500 free flights and tickets for Miami \u2013 \u201cwe want the US fans to see their passion,\u201d Tebas said \u2013 returning on the day; flight, ticket and two days\u2019 hotel in Miami for \u20ac450; a 40% discount on their season ticket next year; or (up to 5,000) free tickets for Barcelona-Girona at the Camp Nou. Plans were made, including the suggestion the teams stand for the Spanish national anthem before the match.</p> \n<p>But it was not so simple. Lopetegui expressed reservations, Madrid making powerful opposition, pulling some of the media with them. A handful of Barcelona players <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/27/the-earth-moves-at-valladolid-to-spoil-la-liga-return-against-barcelona\">made their irritation public</a>. The players\u2019 union threatened to strike. And the Spanish football federation, who had taken the Super Cup to Tangiers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/sep/07/sacking-lopetegui-spain-fa-head-luis-rubiales-la-liga-game-us\">moved against the proposal</a>. As it was up to the RFEF to authorise the game, as Fifa then backed them, that was basically that.</p> \n<p>The battle, though, continued and was played out publicly. The contract with Relevent didn\u2019t oblige the league to play games in the US; it only obliged them to do all they could to play games in the US, which might help explain why the fight went on and also why it was acted-out before an audience. There was a petition supposedly from American fans, explicitly presenting them as the true guardians of football, demanding \u201cbring US the game\u201d, and Tebas talked about going to court. But that petition is <a href=\"https://bringusthegame.pgtb.me/cLjvK9\">an empty black page now</a>, and they never stood before a judge. They never went to the US either. Amidst the fighting, Barcelona backed out, appealing for \u201cconsensus\u201d.</p> \n<p>They weren\u2019t going to Miami, after all. Instead, they went to Montilivi, setting off at 10.10am on Sunday morning for the 70-minute drive, and heading back again that evening. They returned with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/27/european-roundup-lionel-messi-helps-barcelona-to-win-at-girona\">a 2-0 victory</a>, secured in a packed, noisy and sometimes hostile stadium, a proper away game.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ElevenSports_UK/status/1089565563939098627\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">| GOAL! | <br><br>Dink, scoop, chip.

Montilivi had never been fuller. They belted out the anthem <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tsf_podcast/status/1089543035459960833\">at the start</a> and they chanted for Catalan independence on 17.14, flags unfurled, but mostly they roared their team on, hammering feet on scaffolding stands and shouting. Briefly, the place fell silent apart from one corner of cul\u00e9s and a small smattering of them around the ground when N\u00e9lson Semedo scored the first. But it wasn\u2019t quiet for long. The rain came, hard, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tsf_podcast/status/1089550080632332290\">a heavy curtain of water</a>, but they didn\u2019t depart. A rainbow appeared, hope too. And they kept shouting.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWelcome to Miami,\u201d the sign said. Scribbled in black pen on white cardboard and fixed to the fence by the stadium where long lines of tables were laid out and the atmosphere was building, it greeted them as they arrived \u2013 football fans heading to the biggest game of the year. Mostly, they strolled from town, through narrow, old streets, yellow ribbons attached to every lamppost, along the river where the houses overlooking the water are brightly coloured, not pastel, across the bridge and up a gentle hill in the sunshine. There, past concrete police controls was another sign, bigger and more professionally produced, yellow letters on a red backdrop covering the stand. \u201cOne team, one fanbase, one city,\u201d it declared. And that team, those fans, that city, was Girona. Not Miami. Three days after they had played Copa del Rey quarter-final first legs, three days before they play Copa del Rey quarter-final second legs, Girona were playing Barcelona in the league. This was that game: the one they had announced would be played in the USA, 7,586km away. But when the day arrived, Sunday 4.15pm local time, the thousands of fans making their way there headed along Avinguda Montilivi, not the Ronald Reagan Turnpike. This wasn\u2019t the Hard Rock Stadium, this was home: the city that provides the setting for Game of Thrones rather than Miami Vice and the ground embedded into the rocks out beyond the medieval maze. Leo Messi had come to town, their town, where he was whistled but where he won. And where Javier Tebas lost. The league\u2019s president is $10,000 poorer today, or he would have been if he\u2019d actually put his considerable money where his considerable mouth is. In an interview with CNN, Tebas had said: \u201cI bet you $10,000 that Girona-Barcelona gets played in Miami.\u201d Yet the day before the match, Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde grinned: \u201cIt\u2019s not in Miami? You don\u2019t say \u2026\u201d Two days before that, Girona manager Eusebio Sacristan had admitted he was as \u201chappy as could be\u201d that they were not about to board a plane across the ocean. And when kick-off came, Spain\u2019s catchiest club anthem boring its way into brains, it came in Catalonia. There were three days to go before the season started when, without warning or consultation, the league announced a \u20ac200m, 15-year development deal with Relevent that would include them taking at least one game a season to the US, starting in Miami, and three weeks after that it was revealed that the game chosen would be Girona-Barcelona. \u201cIf the NBA and the NFL do it, why wouldn\u2019t we?\u201d Tebas said, as if they were the same thing. He insisted it would be good for the league, helping its growth, pushing into a key market. There were no figures presented to demonstrate how much of an impact a single game (for now) would make but the rationale was logical and the urgency was understandable: within La Liga, they were well aware of the strength of the Premier League, fearing it could eclipse all else. There was a sense that something had to be done; they had to try, at least. Besides, they reasoned, taking games abroad some day is inevitable, so they should get there first before all those other leagues did it. To start with the idea was welcomed; the doubts and debate came later. It was striking how quickly and easily it was accepted: there were few dissenting voices, no great outcry, no uprising, and in the press it was promoted, a project to get behind. Pretty much no one said much about the fans, but then pretty much no one ever does. Not much was said about the implications for the integrity of the competition either, until Julen Lopetegui raised it. The league said no clubs would be forced to go and plenty offered. Madrid refused. Barcelona and Girona agreed. For a club Girona\u2019s size, a fee of around \u20ac3m matters. Jaume Roures, board member and head of Mediapro who own the TV rights to La Liga, declared it would \u201cput Girona in the world\u201d. The date and time were announced four months in advance \u2013 which is three months and two weeks earlier than January\u2019s other games were announced and even then, some got changed later \u2013 and the league offered very attractive compensation packages for fans. Up to 1,500 free flights and tickets for Miami \u2013 \u201cwe want the US fans to see their passion,\u201d Tebas said \u2013 returning on the day; flight, ticket and two days\u2019 hotel in Miami for \u20ac450; a 40% discount on their season ticket next year; or (up to 5,000) free tickets for Barcelona-Girona at the Camp Nou. Plans were made, including the suggestion the teams stand for the Spanish national anthem before the match. But it was not so simple. Lopetegui expressed reservations, Madrid making powerful opposition, pulling some of the media with them. A handful of Barcelona players made their irritation public. The players\u2019 union threatened to strike. And the Spanish football federation, who had taken the Super Cup to Tangiers, moved against the proposal. As it was up to the RFEF to authorise the game, as Fifa then backed them, that was basically that. The battle, though, continued and was played out publicly. The contract with Relevent didn\u2019t oblige the league to play games in the US; it only obliged them to do all they could to play games in the US, which might help explain why the fight went on and also why it was acted-out before an audience. There was a petition supposedly from American fans, explicitly presenting them as the true guardians of football, demanding \u201cbring US the game\u201d, and Tebas talked about going to court. But that petition is an empty black page now, and they never stood before a judge. They never went to the US either. Amidst the fighting, Barcelona backed out, appealing for \u201cconsensus\u201d. They weren\u2019t going to Miami, after all. Instead, they went to Montilivi, setting off at 10.10am on Sunday morning for the 70-minute drive, and heading back again that evening. They returned with a 2-0 victory, secured in a packed, noisy and sometimes hostile stadium, a proper away game. It had been quite an occasion, a match announced by Girona\u2019s captain reading poetry. Montilivi had never been fuller. They belted out the anthem at the start and they chanted for Catalan independence on 17.14, flags unfurled, but mostly they roared their team on, hammering feet on scaffolding stands and shouting. Briefly, the place fell silent apart from one corner of cul\u00e9s and a small smattering of them around the ground when N\u00e9lson Semedo scored the first. But it wasn\u2019t quiet for long. The rain came, hard, a heavy curtain of water, but they didn\u2019t depart. A rainbow appeared, hope too. And they kept shouting. They shouted when Cristhian Stuani tumbled, Jordi Alba holding his shirt; when Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen saved from Stuani; and when Gerard Piqu\u00e9 cleared Pere Pons\u2019s shot off the line. They shouted when Ter Stegen stopped Stuani again, twice. And when Sergio Busquets slid in to block Aleix Garc\u00eda, they thought the goal was coming, but it didn\u2019t. They shouted when, with 40 minutes still to go, Bernardo was sent off for a second yellow as questionable as the first \u2013 \u201crigorous,\u201d Stuani called it, \u201ca foul and no more\u201d \u2013 and they whistled Messi because he was the one who had demanded the card. They were still whistling him when he scored the second, superbly made by Luis Su\u00e1rez and Alba. Lifting the ball gently over Bono, who later made three more impressive saves, Messi had ended it, as he tends to do. Barcelona had played Russian Roulette, El Mundo said, but they had survived, winning their eighth in a row to keep them five points ahead of Atl\u00e9tico and 10 over Madrid. Messi has scored in the last seven of them; he\u2019s scored or assisted in the last 14 matches. \u201cMiami deserved to see Messi,\u201d Marca wrote (why?), while Sport suggested it was a blessing the game hadn\u2019t been played in the US as \u201cthis was not exactly the kind of spectacle that makes people football fans\u201d.

Montilivi that deserved it, too. \u201cThey play some of the best football in Spain,\u201d Alba said, but Girona had been beaten again, extending their run to eight without a win. They were wondering how when they left the stadium and began the short walk home. Talking points \u2022 It\u2019s nice to be able to sum up Karim Benzema\u2019s performance at Espanyol in three words: oh, la \u2026 la. \u2022 Another man down? Four in a row without a win since Iago Aspas got injured has left a second Celta manager on the verge of the sack. \u2022 Gaizka Garitano keeps going: he was insisting thatit\u2019s not done yet but Athletic, relegation bound when he took over, are up to eleventh11th. \u2022 \u201cEither we smash a fist on the desk for fucking once, or this is going to be very, very difficult,\u201d Luis Garc\u00eda said after Villarreal were beaten 3-0 by Valencia.

      "bodyText": "A second gilets jaunes (yellow vests) \u201cleader\u201d has announced she is founding a political party but will not field candidates in May\u2019s European parliament elections. Jacline Mouraud, widely credited with starting the yellow vests movement, said the party, Les \u00c9mergents (the Arisen), \u201cwon\u2019t be rightwing or leftwing\u201d and will aim to do politics differently. \u201cWe want to remake politics around the heart and empathy; today it\u2019s based on the rule of money. We want to take everyone into account by working for a better distribution of wealth,\u201d said Mouraud at a press conference to announce the party in the city of Orl\u00e9ans. The venue for the conference was announced only minutes before it started due to threats by other members of the movement which has no official leaders or organisation. Mouraud, 51, from Brittany, describes herself as a \u201chypnotherapist and artist\u201d. Last October she posted a video on Facebook criticising the government\u2019s proposed eco-tax on fuel which went viral. It sparked a wave of protesters taking to the streets in the yellow high-vis vests that French motorists must carry in their vehicles. Mouraud said Les \u00c9mergents would take part in local elections in 2020. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to not have enough money to buy food for the children,\u201d she said. The new party\u2019s programme includes removing privileges from elected representatives \u2013 targeted at MPs, developing \u201ccharity houses\u201d paid for by donations from major company chiefs, a reduction in VAT on essential products and higher taxes for higher earners. \u201cPhase A has been done \u2013 everyone knows what is happening in France. Now we have to pass on to phase B and launch into building and proposing. To demand without proposing something is a little illogical,\u201d she said. Last week another group of gilets jaunes named 10 candidates for the European parliament elections and called for 69 more to put their names forward. The list, headed by Ingrid Levavasseur, 31, a health worker who has become one of the movement\u2019s most high-profile members, was proposed by a group calling itself the Ralliement d\u2019initiative citoyenne (Citizen Initiative Rally). At the weekend, the latest yellow vest demonstrations in Paris, and elsewhere, was overshadowed by a reportedly larger march by anti-gilets jaunes calling themselves the foulards rouges (red scarves). The foulards rouges are demanding an end to the violence of recent protests and a respect for \u201cthe republic and its institutions\u201d. According to police figures, about 4,000 gilets jaunes protested in Paris on Saturday and about 10,500 foulards rouges on Sunday. The organisers of the demonstrations did not supply any figures.",

Oh, you know the sort: when the lunchtime kick-off features seven goals, two penalties, and a red card, but turns out not to be the most entertaining game of the afternoon. Next up on Sunday came a pair of three-goal comebacks plus a 4-0 away win for a Frosinone team that had only scored 12 times all season. There was drama everywhere, from the Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi \u2013 where Fiorentina blew a two-goal lead, then recovered to beat Chievo with 10 men \u2013 to the Tardini \u2013 where Spal ended an 11-game winless run after having trailed Parma 2-0 in the 70th minute. At the Renato Dall\u2019Ara, following that drubbing by Frosinone, Pippo Inzaghi was expected to be sacked as Bologna manager. Even Juventus\u2019s win over Lazio required a late comeback. The champions were comprehensively outplayed at the Stadio Olimpico, failing to even attempt a shot before the interval \u2013 something that had never happened before in the 14 years that Opta have tracked such statistics. Only the game\u2019s final act felt predictable, Jo\u00e3o Cancelo scoring an equaliser from Juve\u2019s first dangerous attack before Cristiano Ronaldo won it with a penalty. For sheer entertainment, however, Bergamo was the place to be, as Atalanta and Roma played out their second 3-3 draw of the season.

G\u00f3mez picked up where he left off after the break, another fine delivery allowing Rafael Tol\u00f3i to further reduce the arrears. And then Ilicic won a penalty. Well, actually what happened first is that the Slovenian got booked for diving: the referee Gianpaolo Calvarese believing that he had taken a dive on his way into the area. That decision was corrected after a VAR review, replays showing that Kolarov had tripped Ilicic. The stage was set for Duv\u00e1n Zapata: Atalanta\u2019s man of the moment, the most prolific player in Europe\u2019s top five leagues since the start of December and Ronaldo\u2019s unlikely challenger for the title of Serie A capocannoniere.

Where other coaches have asked Zapata to play with his back to goal \u2013 observing his tall, muscular frame and perceiving him as an old-fashioned targetman who can hold the ball up and bring others into play \u2013 Gasperini recognised that the player is more effective facing the other way. The Colombian has always been an explosive runner and able dribbler, but only now, at 27 years old, is consistently getting the opportunity to show it. Although Zapata is notionally the lone striker in Gasperini\u2019s 3-4-2-1, he often drifts left, with Ilicic moving right and G\u00f3mez operating in a free role behind.

      "body": "<p>The origin of this dish is a tapas bar in Barcelona\u2019s Boqueria food market, Pinotxo (named after its twinkly-eyed owner). For me, it epitomises the kind of peasant-style food I love, using humble ingredients of the best quality. Pinotxo uses wonderful dried chickpeas from a neighbouring stall, which are plump and succulent when cooked. As for the sauce, the black pudding melts into a silky, mineral-rich ragu.</p> <h2>Chickpea, black pudding and spinach ragu (pictured above)</h2> <p>If you can, buy dried chickpeas from a specialist supplier \u2013 you will be amazed at their quality. Ditto the black pudding. This recipe is at least thrice the sum of its parts.</p> <p>Soak <strong>Overnight</strong><br>Prep <strong>15 min<br></strong>Cook <strong>1 hr 30 min<br></strong>Serves <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>300g dried chickpeas</strong>, soaked overnight<br><strong>75ml extra-virgin olive oil</strong><br><strong>2 red onions</strong>, peeled and finely sliced<br><strong>1 leek</strong>, finely sliced<br><strong>Salt and black pepper</strong><br><strong>3 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and finely chopped<br><strong>2-3 fresh bay leaves</strong><br><strong>1 x 400g tin plum tomatoes</strong><br><strong>150g black pudding</strong>, roughly chopped<br><strong>\u00be tsp ground cinnamon</strong><br><strong>1 heaped tsp smoked paprika</strong><br><strong>2-3 tbsp sherry vinegar</strong><br><strong>150g baby spinach</strong><br><strong>Lemon wedges</strong>, to serve</p> <p>Drain the soaked chickpeas, then cover with plenty of cold water and bring to a boil. Simmer for 40\u201150 minutes, until tender, then add half a teaspoon of salt to the water, stir and leave to cool. (If you haven\u2019t had time to soak them overnight, add one teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda to their cooking water, and simmer for approximately 80 minutes, until tender.)</p> <p>Warm the oil in a wide, deep pan over a medium-high heat, and add the onions and leek. Season generously, and fry gently for a few minutes before turning the heat down to medium and cooking until the vegetables soften, about 10 minutes.</p> <p>Add the garlic and bay, and cook for another few minutes, then add the tomatoes, black pudding, cinnamon, paprika and two tablespoons of vinegar. Break up the black pudding with a spoon, then cook for 15 minutes, leaving the ingredients to bubble away together gently.</p> <p>Drain the chickpeas, reserving a cup of the cooking water, then fold into the sauce. Taste, and adjust the seasoning, then continue to simmer for another five to 10 minutes, allowing the flavours to mingle. Add a little cooking water if the sauce looks too dry, and the remaining vinegar if it needs more sparkle.</p> <p>When you are ready to eat, stir in the spinach and cook for a few minutes, until it has wilted into the sauce. Serve in bowls with lemon wedges, a slosh of extra-virgin olive oil and bread to mop up the sauce.</p> <h2><strong>And for the rest of the week</strong></h2> <p>This ragu is also good with rice, pasta (I like pappardelle), a green salad or, best of all, homemade patatas bravas. Consider cooking double the amount of chickpeas and freezing half, ready to whip out of the freezer for a midweek fix. Fry any leftover black pudding until golden, and toss in a salad of bitter leaves and crisp bacon, topped with a poached egg.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The origin of this dish is a tapas bar in Barcelona\u2019s Boqueria food market, Pinotxo (named after its twinkly-eyed owner). For me, it epitomises the kind of peasant-style food I love, using humble ingredients of the best quality. Pinotxo uses wonderful dried chickpeas from a neighbouring stall, which are plump and succulent when cooked. As for the sauce, the black pudding melts into a silky, mineral-rich ragu. Chickpea, black pudding and spinach ragu (pictured above) If you can, buy dried chickpeas from a specialist supplier \u2013 you will be amazed at their quality. Ditto the black pudding. This recipe is at least thrice the sum of its parts. Soak Overnight Prep 15 min Cook 1 hr 30 min Serves 4 300g dried chickpeas, soaked overnight 75ml extra-virgin olive oil 2 red onions, peeled and finely sliced 1 leek, finely sliced Salt and black pepper 3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped 2-3 fresh bay leaves 1 x 400g tin plum tomatoes 150g black pudding, roughly chopped \u00be tsp ground cinnamon 1 heaped tsp smoked paprika 2-3 tbsp sherry vinegar 150g baby spinach Lemon wedges, to serve Drain the soaked chickpeas, then cover with plenty of cold water and bring to a boil. Simmer for 40\u201150 minutes, until tender, then add half a teaspoon of salt to the water, stir and leave to cool. (If you haven\u2019t had time to soak them overnight, add one teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda to their cooking water, and simmer for approximately 80 minutes, until tender.) Warm the oil in a wide, deep pan over a medium-high heat, and add the onions and leek. Season generously, and fry gently for a few minutes before turning the heat down to medium and cooking until the vegetables soften, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and bay, and cook for another few minutes, then add the tomatoes, black pudding, cinnamon, paprika and two tablespoons of vinegar. Break up the black pudding with a spoon, then cook for 15 minutes, leaving the ingredients to bubble away together gently. Drain the chickpeas, reserving a cup of the cooking water, then fold into the sauce. Taste, and adjust the seasoning, then continue to simmer for another five to 10 minutes, allowing the flavours to mingle. Add a little cooking water if the sauce looks too dry, and the remaining vinegar if it needs more sparkle. When you are ready to eat, stir in the spinach and cook for a few minutes, until it has wilted into the sauce. Serve in bowls with lemon wedges, a slosh of extra-virgin olive oil and bread to mop up the sauce. And for the rest of the week This ragu is also good with rice, pasta (I like pappardelle), a green salad or, best of all, homemade patatas bravas. Consider cooking double the amount of chickpeas and freezing half, ready to whip out of the freezer for a midweek fix. Fry any leftover black pudding until golden, and toss in a salad of bitter leaves and crisp bacon, topped with a poached egg.",

Here, frying is important.</p> <p>Before frying, though, resting. In the introduction to his book of essays, the Italian food writer and historian Massimo Montanari recounts a time he made meatballs.

It then occurs to Montanari that letting the food rest before cooking is similar to what happens in our minds when we work out an idea.

It is with resting that the milky bread (a thick slice in five tablespoons of milk) and egg (one, beaten) plump up, expand like a foam filler and soften the texture; the parmesan (three tablespoons) seasons the meat (500g minced beef and 50g finely chopped pancetta); the onion (a small one, diced) infuses everything with its savoury base note, salt and pepper, too. This amount of mixture should yield 22 meatballs. I don\u2019t roll them in dry breadcrumbs, rather leave them to rest for at least two hours, then fry them gently in a good amount of olive oil.

Quarter and shred a medium-sized cabbage, and put it, along with a peeled and crushed clove of garlic, in the pan you have just taken the meatballs out of (which will be thick with oil, dark juices and nubs of meat). Turn for a few minutes, then cover with a lid and cook until the cabbage has wilted into a tender slump. To finish, you add 200g chopped plum tomatoes to the cabbage, then the meatballs, and simmer everything for another 15 minutes.</p> <p>The cabbage slumps further, its green fading and its porcelain-like ribs becoming indistinguishable in the muddle of meatballs and flecks of red.

However, the weakening Turkish lira has left many companies struggling to pay off the foreign currency debt borrowed to finance projects, stalling work and bankrupting companies. The collapsing construction bubble has resulted in half-finished high-rises and ghost towns all over the country. Atilla Yesilada, Turkey analyst for GlobalSource Partners, an emerging markets analysis firm, said Burj al Babas\u2019s fate was a snapshot of the wider malaise plaguing the Turkish construction sector. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the homebuilders who go bankrupt. The people who supply goods to those industries \u2013 the architects, the technicians, the glass makers \u2013 those people suffer too,\u201d he said. Last year, Turkey slashed the financial and investment criteria for foreigners to become Turkish citizens, in a move it is hoped will double annual property investment by foreigners to around \u00a37.6bn. Despite no sure indications that the country\u2019s economic woes will reverse in the near future, Sarot Group is still hopeful Gulf investors, lured by the prospect of Turkish passports, will return and Burj al Babas will be finished. \u201cWe only need to sell 100 villas to pay off our debt,\u201d said Yerdelen. \u201cI believe we can get over this crisis in four to five months and partially inaugurate the project in 2019.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Top story: Democratic primary could be complicated by Schultz The California senator Kamala Harris kicked off her presidential campaign with a rally in her hometown of Oakland on Sunday, drawing a crowd of 20,000 and positioning herself as a frontrunner in an already crowded field. But there are complications ahead: Harris\u2019s record on criminal justice could dent her support among the black community, while she faces stiff competition from her fellow senator Elizabeth Warren \u2013 not to mention the veteran campaigners Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, who, like Harris, have published books that read a lot like presidential manifestos. Trump\u2019s \u2018best hope\u2019. The former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz says he is \u201cseriously considering running for president as a centrist independent\u201d. His Democratic contender Juli\u00e1n Castro said such a high-profile third-party candidacy would be Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbest hope of getting re-elected\u201d. US begins making first low-yield nuclear warheads The first of a new variety of low-yield US nuclear warhead, with approximately a third of the force of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, has rolled off the production line at a weapons plant in Texas. Arms control advocates warn that the development of the W76-2, a modification of the existing Trident warhead, threatens to lower the threshold for a future nuclear conflict. Its manufacture was ordered by the Trump administration\u2019s nuclear posture review last year. Fatal miscalculation? The Trump administration claims the development of a low-yield weapon makes nuclear war less likely by giving the US a more flexible deterrent. But critics say that ignores the possibility of a miscalculation on the US side. Venezuela crisis: US warns regime against targeting diplomats The White House national security adviser, John Bolton, has warned that any violence or intimidation of American diplomats in Venezuela, or of the opposition figurehead Juan Guaid\u00f3, would draw a \u201csignificant response\u201d from the US, as the country\u2019s leadership crisis continues. Guaid\u00f3, the national assembly leader who declared himself the country\u2019s \u201cinterim president\u201d, has offered amnesty to members of the Venezuelan security forces who defect to his side from the regime of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Exclusive interview. In an exclusive interview, Guaid\u00f3 told the Guardian that Venezuela now has a chance \u201cto leave the chaos behind\u201d. Wider threat. But many are suspicious of Guaid\u00f3, and of Trump\u2019s support for his opposition movement. This coup is a threat to the wider world, argues Oscar Guardiola-Rivera. Virginia teachers strike as state offers Amazon tax breaks Teachers in Virginia are set to go on strike on Monday over school funding and teacher pay, in the latest example of industrial action by frustrated educators across the US. In Virginia, the statewide strikes have also been sparked by the state offering vast tax breaks to Amazon to build its new headquarters there, even as classroom overcrowding means more than 22,000 students are being taught in cheaply constructed plywood trailers in Fairfax county, the third richest county in the US. Skewed priorities? Virginia\u2019s Democratic governor Ralph Northam wants to increase education funding by $269m, but has proposed to spend a whopping $750m to lure Amazon\u2019s \u201cHQ2\u201d to Crystal City in northern Virginia. Crib sheet Wang Quanzhang, the prominent Chinese human rights lawyer, has been sentenced to more than four years in prison for \u201csubversion of state power\u201d by a court in Tianjin. Black Panther has won the top award, for outstanding performance by a cast in a motion picture, at the annual Screen Actors Guild awards in Los Angeles. A three-year-old boy found safe after two nights alone in the freezing North Carolina woods has told police he was helped during the ordeal by a friendly bear. Genes associated with antibiotic-resistant superbugs have been discovered in soil from the Arctic region of Svalbard, one of the most remote places on earth, demonstrating the global scale of the risk posed by antibiotic resistance. Listen to Today in Focus: victims of online conspiracy theories On today\u2019s podcast, Ed Pilkington talks to four people who fell victim to online conspiracy theories about the impact of going viral, including a man wrongly identified as the Parkland school gunman, and the pizza restaurant owner falsely accused of running a paedophile ring.

Oscar Schwartz asks Gavin, his family \u2013 and his agent \u2013 how they manage his online superstardom. Freida Pinto is sick of playing eye candy Freida Pinto launched her career in Slumdog Millionaire, playing \u201cthe most beautiful girl in the world\u201d. She\u2019s been playing beautiful girls ever since \u2013 and she\u2019s tired of it, she tells Simon Hattenstone. Which is why her latest role is in a brutal sex-trafficking drama. The rise of the \u2018anti-tour\u2019 travel experience Millennials are demanding a more \u201cauthentic\u201d travel experience than the traditional tourist trail can offer.

Opinion The Democratic primary field is already among the most diverse in history. But the party\u2019s voters must select a 2020 presidential candidate based not on their identity, but on their policies, says Clio Chang. The diverse Democratic field [presents] a chance to push for the candidate not with their preferred identity, but with the most comprehensively feminist and anti-racist policy positions.

They maintained their six-point lead at the top with a 5-1 win over Hannover, which also marked the first time in over six years that Marco Reus \u2013 returning from injury \u2013 and Mario G\u00f6tze had scored in the same match. Of the many fascinating stories surrounding BVB\u2019s resurgence, G\u00f6tze\u2019s return to relevance is emerging as one of the biggest.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1089530065115844608\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">For the first time since 2013 Marco Reus and Mario Gotze score in the same game. \ud83d\ude4c<br><br>Dortmund continue to set the pace in Germany \ud83d\udd25 <a href=\"https://t.co/C1gNXI1oeq\">pic.twitter.com/C1gNXI1oeq</a></p>\u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1089530065115844608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 27, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 It ended up being Andr\u00e9 Breitenreiter\u2019s last match in charge at Hannover. He was sacked and replaced by Thomas Doll, who last coached in the Bundesliga at Dortmund over 10 years ago. Doll\u2019s deal to summer 2020, stressed general manager Horst Heldt, will be seen out whether the 96ers go down or not.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Manuel Baum might be next. Despite being backed by sporting director Stefan Reuter after Saturday\u2019s 2-0 defeat at Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, the Augsburg coach hardly received a ringing endorsement from defender Martin Hinteregger, who told Bayerischer Rundfunk: \u201cI can\u2019t say anything positive about him, and will say nothing negative.\u201d Gladbach are still just a point shy of Bayern but might be unsettled by a big offer for top scorer Alessane Pl\u00e9a from Dalian Yifang. Their opening bid is estimated at \u20ac40m, not to mention the riches on offer to the Frenchman.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Bayern\u2019s 4-1 win over Stuttgart was their seventh straight in the Bundesliga, but not always convincing. It all hinged on a spell of less than a minute in the second half, when Nico Gonz\u00e1lez had the goal at his mercy but hit Manuel Neuer and then a post, before the hosts were gifted a penalty seconds later. Robert Lewandowski only hit a post but Stuttgart\u2019s chance had been and gone, with Leon Goretzka and Lewandowski\u2019s late goals mopping things up.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76ddc3ac193c38d94e97366453eccfcb553d48c0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76ddc3ac193c38d94e97366453eccfcb553d48c0/0_0_3600_2730/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leon Goretzka celebrates scoring.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"758\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leon Goretzka celebrates scoring.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guenter Schiffmann/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 For once, it wasn\u2019t Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s forwards who were making the headlines, as Kevin Trapp pulled off a string of saves in a 2-2 draw at Werder Bremen, with Ante Rebi\u0107 and S\u00e9bastien Haller each scoring equalisers.

Of the many fascinating stories surrounding BVB\u2019s resurgence, G\u00f6tze\u2019s return to relevance is emerging as one of the biggest. \u2022 It ended up being Andr\u00e9 Breitenreiter\u2019s last match in charge at Hannover. He was sacked and replaced by Thomas Doll, who last coached in the Bundesliga at Dortmund over 10 years ago. Doll\u2019s deal to summer 2020, stressed general manager Horst Heldt, will be seen out whether the 96ers go down or not. \u2022 Manuel Baum might be next. Despite being backed by sporting director Stefan Reuter after Saturday\u2019s 2-0 defeat at Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, the Augsburg coach hardly received a ringing endorsement from defender Martin Hinteregger, who told Bayerischer Rundfunk: \u201cI can\u2019t say anything positive about him, and will say nothing negative.\u201d Gladbach are still just a point shy of Bayern but might be unsettled by a big offer for top scorer Alessane Pl\u00e9a from Dalian Yifang. Their opening bid is estimated at \u20ac40m, not to mention the riches on offer to the Frenchman. \u2022 Bayern\u2019s 4-1 win over Stuttgart was their seventh straight in the Bundesliga, but not always convincing. It all hinged on a spell of less than a minute in the second half, when Nico Gonz\u00e1lez had the goal at his mercy but hit Manuel Neuer and then a post, before the hosts were gifted a penalty seconds later. Robert Lewandowski only hit a post but Stuttgart\u2019s chance had been and gone, with Leon Goretzka and Lewandowski\u2019s late goals mopping things up. \u2022 For once, it wasn\u2019t Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s forwards who were making the headlines, as Kevin Trapp pulled off a string of saves in a 2-2 draw at Werder Bremen, with Ante Rebi\u0107 and S\u00e9bastien Haller each scoring equalisers. It was \u201ca good point for us\u201d, said coach Adi H\u00fctter with some understatement. They host Dortmund on Saturday.",

The hoteliers are also parents to 18-year-old Max, who has severe epilepsy and autism. So could cannabis oil be the miracle cure they have dreamed of? In this one-off documentary they weigh up the risks, learn more about the legalisation debate and affectingly reveal the everyday challenges of caring for a son with special needs. EEJ Inside Europe: 10 Years of Turmoil 9pm, BBC Two Instructive three-parter in which presidents, prime ministers and their top advisers reveal how they fought to stop the EU from being torn apart. It begins by documenting how the Tories\u2019 fixation with Europe pushed David Cameron to call the referendum. Useful context but scant consolation. MB Cold Feet 9pm, ITV To a music festival, where young Adam is gigging with his band. While Jenny gets into the festival spirit, Pete wonders what she\u2019s not telling him. Meanwhile, as the eighth series continues, Adam is still trying to chase the opposite sex/his youth, and finds a willing playmate in Karen, while David befriends a cookie seller.

This helpful new taboo-busting series offers a refreshing (if at times eyewatering) alternative to all its prissy precursors. It sees experts offer a full sexual MOT to anyone aged 16 to 24, aided by specialists who advise on issues ranging from fetishes to safe sex. Long overdue.

MB Film choice Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 7.25pm, ITV2 Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) arrives in prohibition-era New York with nothing but a battered suitcase. But, since this fantasy is directed by Potter stalwart David Yates and written by JK Rowling, it\u2019s no surprise to learn that Newt is a wizard and his case contains a menagerie of fabulous creatures.

(This is despite the fact that some of Harris\u2019s <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/01/20/a-problem-for-kamala-harris-can-a-prosecutor-become-president-in-the-age-of-black-lives-matter/\">harshest</a> and most <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/01/kamala-harris-truths-we-hold-review/579430/\">comprehensive</a> critics have been black women.)</p> <p>This reductionism skates over the opportunity that the diverse Democratic field actually presents: a chance to push for the candidate not with their preferred identity, but with the most comprehensively feminist and anti-racist policy positions. For one, the person who ultimately wins the nomination will face off against a historically unpopular president. While much of this could change over a years-long campaign, early polling shows that all of the Democrats\u2019 favored candidates are likely to beat Donald Trump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/1087758614012575751\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Democratic firm <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ppppolls?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ppppolls</a> surveys early 2020 head-to-head contests:<br><br>Biden 53%, Trump 41%<br>Sanders 51%, Trump 41%<br>Harris 48%, Trump 41%<br>O\u2019Rourke 47%, Trump 41%<br>Warren 48%, Trump 42%<br>Booker 47%, Trump 42%<br>Gillibrand 47%, Trump 42%<br><br>**<br><br>Trump approval: 40/57<a href=\"https://t.co/bATutAFANR\">https://t.co/bATutAFANR</a></p>&mdash; Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/1087758614012575751?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 22, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>As Eric Levitz has argued over at <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/07/democrats-should-distrust-electability-arguments-in-2020.html\">New York magazine</a>, this means that voters should be wary of arguments claiming a candidate\u2019s electability. \u201cBarring a sharp change in the political winds (or Trump\u2019s removal from office), Democratic voters should ignore such punditry, and simply vote for whichever candidate they would most like to be president,\u201d Levitz wrote. In other words, better to ignore media and political operatives who think Warren is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/31/elizabeth-warren-hillary-clinton-1077008\">unlikable</a>\u201d \u2013 especially if she can both win and do so on a substantively feminist policy platform.</p> <p>For progressives, this means the opportunity to push for the candidate with the policies they want. Harris should be criticized, not only because she has <a href=\"https://theslot.jezebel.com/who-is-kamala-harriss-new-memoir-for-1831585534\">harmed marginalized communities</a> in her time as a prosecutor, but also because she has shown very little willingness to grapple with that record.

Throughout The Truths We Hold, Harris fans this ideological beatification without deeply interrogating its roots or its consequences.\u201d</p> <p>And often, representation-first praise of candidates can help to conceal hidden policy agendas.

      "bodyText": "With a diverse influx of candidates, the Democratic presidential race is already being framed in historic terms. When Kirsten Gillibrand and Elizabeth Warren announced their campaigns, making it the first time two female senators would be running for a party\u2019s presidential nomination at the same time, outlets declared that \u201cwomen have already made history in the 2020 Democratic primary\u201d. And when she entered the race on Martin Luther King Jr Day, Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign logo paid tribute to Shirley Chisholm, the first black person and woman to run for a major party presidential nomination. \u201cThis moment is more than a milestone \u2013 it\u2019s a ground-gripping convulsion,\u201d Swanee Hunt wrote for CNN. That the Democratic primary field is already one of the most diverse in history is a welcome fact for sure. Yet we are hardly a month into the race and the pervasive argument of representation over policy has already begun to surface. Reporters have posited that January 2019 could be the month \u201cthat Democrats truly become the party of women\u201d simply because more women are running. And others have dismissed criticisms of Harris, whose prosecutorial record has become a target of progressives, implying that they are a leftist conspiracy or simply unfairly weighted attacks against a black woman running for office. (This is despite the fact that some of Harris\u2019s harshest and most comprehensive critics have been black women.) This reductionism skates over the opportunity that the diverse Democratic field actually presents: a chance to push for the candidate not with their preferred identity, but with the most comprehensively feminist and anti-racist policy positions. For one, the person who ultimately wins the nomination will face off against a historically unpopular president. While much of this could change over a years-long campaign, early polling shows that all of the Democrats\u2019 favored candidates are likely to beat Donald Trump. As Eric Levitz has argued over at New York magazine, this means that voters should be wary of arguments claiming a candidate\u2019s electability. \u201cBarring a sharp change in the political winds (or Trump\u2019s removal from office), Democratic voters should ignore such punditry, and simply vote for whichever candidate they would most like to be president,\u201d Levitz wrote. In other words, better to ignore media and political operatives who think Warren is \u201cunlikable\u201d \u2013 especially if she can both win and do so on a substantively feminist policy platform. For progressives, this means the opportunity to push for the candidate with the policies they want. Harris should be criticized, not only because she has harmed marginalized communities in her time as a prosecutor, but also because she has shown very little willingness to grapple with that record. As the Atlantic\u2019s Hannah Giorgis wrote in her review of Harris\u2019s recent memoir: \u201cIt is tempting for some to view Harris\u2019s marginalized identities as evidence enough of her progressive politics. Throughout The Truths We Hold, Harris fans this ideological beatification without deeply interrogating its roots or its consequences.\u201d And often, representation-first praise of candidates can help to conceal hidden policy agendas. Take Hunt, who wrote that Harris\u2019s run \u201cgives us a glimpse at a new reality \u2013 a leader who embodies the convergence of race and gender in America\u201d. As journalist Melissa Gira Grant pointed out on Twitter, Hunt conveniently failed to mention that she and Harris align on policies that undermine the rights of sex workers. Gillibrand also has to answer for less-than-feminist spots on her record, perhaps most significantly on her Wall Street-friendly stances. Empowering big banks has only resulted in disastrous consequences for women and people of color. Yet before she even announced her bid, it was reported that Gillibrand was calling up donors within the financial sector to seek their support. None of this is to dismiss the fact that the female candidates are sure to face a barrage of sexist attacks that (potential) white male candidates like Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders won\u2019t. When Warren announced her campaign, her \u201clikability\u201d was immediately questioned. Gillibrand has been continually branded as an \u201copportunist\u201d for speaking out against former senator Al Franken\u2019s alleged groping and forcibly kissing numerous women. On Monday, she was described by Fox News hosts as having a \u201cmental illness\u201d because of her shifting policy positions. Harris only threw her hat in the ring a few days ago and has already faced a redux of racist birther conspiracies. But one can simultaneously acknowledge that these obstacles exist, while also holding candidates\u2019 feet to the fire when it comes to their policies and records. This applies across the board \u2013 if Sanders ends up running, he will need to ditch the line that people working \u201c40 hours a week\u201d shouldn\u2019t live in poverty. It\u2019s harmful rhetoric that only plays into welfare reform-era ideas of deserving and undeserving poor, targeting poor black women. With the nomination still up for grabs for any of the candidates, it\u2019s imperative that we don\u2019t fall for symbolism over substance. We\u2019ve already seen that strategy fail just two years ago. Energy on the left has only grown since the 2016 election, meaning that we have a chance to see history being made: a Democratic nominee with a truly progressive policy platform.

Desert lions became locally extinct in 1990 due to persecution from livestock farmers. However, by 1997, a pride returned to the area and numbers have been increasing ever since. The area now sustains approximately 130-150 lions. The first time lions were recorded feeding on marine life since returning to the desert was in 2006, where lionesses were observed eating a seal. Then, in 2017, a lioness in poor condition was spotted hunting cormorants, while others were seen hunting flamingos and teals. Stander said he has observed lions foraging in intertidal areas, so it is possible their diet could expand to other marine life such as shellfish, crabs and sea turtles.",

He was two and half.</p> <p>His grandfather had just passed away after a long battle with cancer, and his extended family gathered every Sunday to share a meal. Gavin was the only grandchild, the center of attention. The adults doted over him and shared photos of his early life via a joint iCloud account.</p> <p>One Sunday, Gavin\u2019s uncle, Nick Mastodon, took a video of Gavin putting stickers on his face and uploaded it to Vine, a recently launched video sharing platform. Mastodon<em><strong> </strong></em>was an early adopter and had gained a decent following <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickmastodon/status/311597980148985856\">making</a> mash-ups of Disney movies and pop songs. Gavin\u2019s happy spontaneity struck a chord with Mastodon\u2019s followers, who demanded more toddler content.</p> <p>Gavin\u2019s mother, Kate Thomas, gave Mastodon permission to spend 20 minutes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOCr8eSqXgM\">making</a> videos with Gavin during their Sunday visits. The format was simple: Mastodon would act, and Gavin would react. In one video, Mastodon asks Gavin: \u201cWhat was your favorite part about going to the doctor today?\u201d Gavin responds: \u201cWhen I throwed up on my jacket.\u201d In another, Mastodon puts a gecko on Gavin\u2019s head and his face oscillates rapidly between anxiety and astonishment.</p> <p>By 2014, Mastodon\u2019s follower count had grown to just under 1 million.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOCr8eSqXgM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vOCr8eSqXgM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>A compilation of Vine videos with Gavin.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Mastodon and Kate thought the videos would be a brief internet craze and then fade into irrelevance. But then they started to notice people taking screenshots of Gavin\u2019s face to make <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1149902-gavin\">reaction memes</a>, such as a <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1149902-gavin\">picture</a> of Gavin with his arms crossed accompanied by the caption: \u201cHow ya mom be looking when you get home too late.\u201d</p> <p>Soon, the Gavin meme had taken on a life of its own. The people of the internet adopted Gavin and started to refer to him as \u201cour son\u201d.</p> <p>Gavin\u2019s dad, Adam, remained mostly oblivious to his son\u2019s fame until late 2017, when one of his colleagues noticed a framed picture of Gavin on his desk.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God, this is hilarious,\u201d he announced to the office. \u201cAdam has a picture of the meme kid on his desk.\u201d</p> <p>Confused, Adam responded that the boy in the picture was his child.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I get the joke,\u201d his colleague said. \u201cHe\u2019s all of our kid. He\u2019s the internet\u2019s son.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Adam replied. \u201cThat\u2019s actually my child \u2013 he is my <em>physical</em> son.\u201d</p> <p>Gavin is now eight \u2013 a second-grader from a middle-class family in Minneapolis. His astonishing online fame led to opportunities his parents never imagined possible. The trade-off is a childhood played out in front of millions of strangers, the cost of which remains to be seen.</p> <p>I recently spent a weekend with Gavin, eager to learn how a seemingly normal family are dealing with the memeification of their only son.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"84f9194be5fe11f5c8af9e2f2c2a516175bba598\"> <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/01/24/image2_v2.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"3000\" height=\"1800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gavin is now eight \u2013 a second grader from a middle-class family in Minneapolis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Thomas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When Kate picked me up from my hotel in downtown Minneapolis on a Friday afternoon, she had just collected Gavin from school. \u201cSay hello to Oscar, Gavs,\u201d Kate said. Reluctantly, Gavin gave me a high five, and then told Kate that he wanted to play Fortnite. \u201cMy phone doesn\u2019t have enough battery,\u201d she said. \u201cBut why don\u2019t we stop off and get you some Wendy\u2019s. You\u2019re probably just a bit tired and hungry.\u201d</p> <p>We were headed to the Winter Lights festival at the Arboretum, a botanical garden and function center on the outskirts of the city. Kate, who is 35, told me that her husband wouldn\u2019t be able to join us \u2013 he is in the military and was away for work.</p> <p>The plan for the evening was to shoot a video of Gavin making cookies with Kate\u2019s sister, who works as head chef at the Arboretum. Over the past few months, Gavin had started making regular vlogs to keep his fans updated about his life.</p> <p>Making these is part of a new content strategy developed by Gavin\u2019s manager, Byron Austen Ashley, who Kate began working with in December 2017. Previously, her strategy for managing Gavin\u2019s online following was haphazard. She had her own social media accounts where she uploaded pictures and videos of Gavin, but most Gavin content was being created by unaffiliated meme accounts, some of which were using his face to sell merchandise.</p> <p>Ashley began by telling Kate to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gavinthomas\">start</a> new social media accounts on Gavin\u2019s behalf and then hire a legal team to shut down the other meme accounts. Kate\u2019s accounts now have millions of followers across multiple online platforms and far greater control over the content that gets disseminated.</p> <p>At the Arboretum, Kate\u2019s sister said that she wouldn\u2019t have time to make a video with Gavin making cookies. \u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d Kate said, handing Gavin a digital camera attached to a small tripod. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go outside and make a video of the lights instead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat people seem to love about Gav is that he\u2019s just a normal kid,\u201d Kate said. \u201cSo, we just take videos of us out and about. And then I go through the footage later and decide what to upload, just like any proud mom.\u201d</p> <p>Once outside, Gavin, who had perked up since his Wendy\u2019s cheeseburger, hit record and took off into a field of snow with illuminated hay-barrels and barns, swinging the camera by his side. When I caught up, he asked if I wanted to play hide and go seek. \u201cSure,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cOK, I\u2019ll hide first,\u201d he said. \u201cTake the camera.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy do I need to take the camera?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cBecause then no one can see me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"38409687f25a09c18ec507190110847120aa73dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38409687f25a09c18ec507190110847120aa73dd/0_9_2800_1816/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gavin Thomas at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"649\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gavin Thomas at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jenn Ackerman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Last year was huge for Gavin. He travelled to China twice, headed to New York to appear on Good Morning America, and in November, he made an appearance at the premier of Ralph Breaks the Internet in Los Angeles. \u201cThat was really amazing,\u201d Kate told me. \u201cThey invited other meme kids, like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txqiwrbYGrs\">David After Dentist</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGhuLkjl4iI\">Side Eye Chloe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X6b19ukfTA\">Backpack Kid</a>, so I got to meet their families and trade stories.\u201d</p> <p>I had reached out to several of these \u201cmeme kids\u201d and their families before meeting Gavin. For most, the experience of internet fame was a meteoric, short-lived experience.</p> <p>Such was the case for David Devore, better known as David After Dentist, whose dad <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txqiwrbYGrs\">shot</a> a video of him while he was still high on pain medication after dental surgery when he was seven. The video went viral and Devore was briefly famous. \u201cNow I\u2019m a senior in high school and applying for college,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019m just a regular kid who plays lacrosse and works out. The whole thing is just kind of like a cool memory.\u201d</p> <p>But not all experiences of unwitting internet fame are so benign. The forebear of this type of celebrity was Ghyslain Raza, who in 2002, at the age of 14, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPPj6viIBmU\">filmed</a> himself fighting imaginary sentries with a golf ball retriever in the media room at his high school. The footage was discovered by three classmates who uploaded it to Kazaa, a file-sharing network. The video was then discovered by blogger Andy Baio, who posted a copy on his popular blog, along with a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNbLCA4WHCk\">remixed</a> version that superimposed Star Wars graphics on to the footage.</p> <p>For 14-year-old Raza, the non-consensual online fame was horrifying. He was mercilessly bullied, lost the few friends he had, and ended up completing his final exams at a hospital psychiatric unit. While Baio retrospectively <a href=\"https://waxy.org/2003/05/finding_the_sta/\">tried</a> to cast Raza as an \u201cinternet hero\u201d, Raza felt like the internet was laughing at him, not with him. \u201cHaving your 15 minutes of fame, when you\u2019ve done something truly worthwhile, is one thing. When you earn it for something humiliating, that\u2019s entirely different,\u201d Raza <a href=\"https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/10-years-later-the-star-wars-kid-speaks-out/\">said</a> in 2013. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but feel worthless, like my life wasn\u2019t worth living.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"fe361e5c413c76802764e4af7a1145ee5e368775\"> <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/01/24/image3_v3.jpg\" alt=\"Art by Tom Silverstone\" width=\"3000\" height=\"1800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018What people seem to love about Gav is that he\u2019s just a normal kid,\u2019 said Kate, his mother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Massahos/Kate Thomas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kate says she is aware of the risks involved with Gavin being so young and so exposed. Someone once superimposed a Clorox label on a picture of Gavin drinking from a mug, making reference to a morbid suicide meme. Another time, a group of teenagers drove to Kate\u2019s mother\u2019s house and made a Vine outside. Since then, the Thomas\u2019s have taken steps to ensure their privacy and Gavin\u2019s safety. They don\u2019t reveal their surname publicly (\u201cThomas\u201d is an alias), never give out their address, and they have asked the school not to identify Gavin to anyone outside of the family.</p> <p>\u201cWe keep a close eye on everything,\u201d Kate told me. \u201cBut mostly, our followers are very nice and often protective. It really does feel like the whole internet is looking out for him, making sure he is drinking his milk, doing his homework. It feels special to see your boy loved by so many strangers.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The next morning, I met Gavin and Kate at the Mall of America, which has an indoor theme park, a mini-golf course, and movie cinemas. \u201cGav knows the social media team here,\u201d Kate told me. \u201cThey love it when he comes and hangs out, so they\u2019ve given us free passes to go on all the rides.\u201d</p> <p>Gavin was dressed in a yellow hoodie with a big picture of his own face on it, which would be available to buy via their new online shop in a few months.</p> <p>Kate is candid about how Gavin\u2019s internet fame could lead him to a career online. If making a living as an internet celebrity was inconceivable a decade ago, it is now a profession that many aspire to. At this stage, Kate told me, Gavin wants to be a YouTube gamer. The most successful ones \u2013 Markiplier, PewDiePie, Fernanfloo \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/03/forbes-seven-year-old-youtuber-ryan-toys-review-made-17m-in-one-year\">earn</a> millions of dollars each year and have more cultural influence among young people than traditional celebrities.</p> <p>To do this, Kate is taking direction from Ashley. They have enrolled him in acting classes and started teaching him how to edit video. They have also set up a Coogan account, a type of trust established in the 1930s to safeguard the money earned by child performers into adulthood.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ardenrose/?hl=en\">Arden Rose</a>, one of Ashley\u2019s other clients, got her start <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtTK007CgzZZXroYjY_UBRA\">making</a> beauty-focused YouTube videos on her dad\u2019s laptop when she was 14 out of their suburban Arkansas home. She accumulated a devoted following online and leveraged this to become the lead actor in two successful TV series: <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5903724/\">Mr Student Body President</a> and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5637544/\">Guidance</a>. She has since designed a jewelry collection, signed big product endorsements with Calvin Klein, authored a book published by HarperCollins, and splits her time between Los Angeles and London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e9f43b1aadda77e1ef08e4d98ccae2a04d716f59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9f43b1aadda77e1ef08e4d98ccae2a04d716f59/0_0_2800_1867/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gavin Thomas plays at Gameworks, an arcade at the Mall of America, in Bloomington, Minn., on Saturday, December 8, 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gavin Thomas plays at Gameworks, an arcade at the Mall of America, in Bloomington, Minnesota.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jenn Ackerman/Guardian US</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Part of what makes internet celebrity so appealing is this sense of accessibility. Whereas being a movie star once required living in a certain place and having certain connections, being a YouTube star ostensibly only requires a camera and the internet.</p> <p>But this democratic access to fame that the internet affords comes at a cost. Last year, a number of high-profile YouTubers talked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/08/youtube-stars-burnout-fun-bleak-stressed\">publicly</a> about the pressure of constant online engagement. Elle Mills, a YouTuber who rose to fame in 2017 after posting a hugely popular \u201ccoming out\u201d video, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKwgq9LRgA\">uploaded</a> a video to her channel in May entitled \u201cburnt out at 19\u201d. She confessed that the grind of producing new content and the emotional labor of interacting with her fans had left her anxious and depressed.</p> <p>Because Kate still runs Gavin\u2019s accounts on his behalf, his engagement with fans is carefully moderated. Yet occasionally, his celebrity spills out into the real world.</p> <p>As we walked around the mall, a number of teenagers took pictures of him from a distance. At one point, Gavin dropped his packet of caramel popcorn on the ground. \u201cOh no! What have you done, Gavin,\u201d said a young woman walking past. \u201cDo you think I can take a selfie with you?\u201d Gavin, popcornless and crestfallen, shook his head. Kate whispered something in his ear. He relinquished and went to stand next to the stranger, producing one of his signature faces, which sits ambiguously between a smile and a grimace.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty normal for us,\u201d Kate said as we made our way to the arcade. \u201cHe\u2019s been recognized in public since he was three. Here in Minnesota, people are pretty reserved and generally keep their distance.</p> <p>\u201cBut in China, it was a different story.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WhatsOnWeibo/status/1083999089346392064\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Name: Gavin Thomas <br>Age: 8<br>Occupation: Internet celebrity/meme icon in China<br>Weibo followers: 2.1 million (!)<br>Famous in China why: his &quot;fake smile&quot; speaks to people familiar with awkward social situations, hence nickname &quot;Fake Smile Boy&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E5%81%87%E7%AC%91%E7%94%B7%E5%AD%A9?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#\u5047\u7b11\u7537\u5b69</a>.

A media team from GQ China followed him around Beijing and Chengdu, taking pictures of Gavin with his fans. Gavin and Kate returned to China in September after being invited to a technology conference hosted by Tencent, the biggest social network and gaming company in the country.</p> <p>This pivot to a Chinese audience started after Ashley was tipped off that Gavin\u2019s face was being used to sell mugs, posters, and clothing on Chinese e-commerce sites. Ashley\u2019s hunch, in his words, was to \u201clean in and capitalize\u201d.</p> <p>When I spoke to Ashley over the phone, he told me that the digital entertainment industry is far more advanced in China than it is in the US. He has been working on forging a number of brand deals for Gavin, including appearing in a hair product advertisement alongside his dad.</p> <p>It is this Chinese fanbase that now distinguishes Gavin from other meme kids. He is becoming less gimmick, more media personality. \u201cThere\u2019s a universe where he\u2019s the most relevant American celebrity in China,\u201d Byron told me. \u201cSome people would say he is already.\u201d</p> <p>I asked Kate what made her son so popular in China. \u201cI think it\u2019s his face,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there\u2019s something about it that is very relatable.\u201d</p> <p>Ashley also believes that Gavin\u2019s face is his most valuable asset in China \u2013 more specifically, the signature smile/grimace face. On Chinese social media, it is used as a meme to connote forced positivity in an otherwise uncomfortable situation. For example, people will post a picture of Gavin\u2019s smile with text that reads: \u201cI can\u2019t wait for school on Monday.\u201d So widespread is this meme that Gavin has become <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2172220/american-fake-smile-boy-china-genuinely-loves\">known</a> by the Chinese media as \u201cthe boy with the fake smile\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re currently working on a strategy to protect this face,\u201d Ashley told me. \u201cThe case we\u2019re making is that the way that Gavin is shared is not so much as a person, but more as an emoji.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Gavin\u2019s uncle is now working as a creative at an advertising firm \u2013 a job he got in part because of his social media presence \u2013 so he has little time to make videos with Gavin. But they\u2019re still close and Mastodon feels a sense of responsibility for how Gavin\u2019s life is now unfolding.</p> <p>\u201cI think that social media makes being a kid and a parent a lot more complicated than it used to be,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhen we were kids, we used to make videos with our neighbors \u2013 I think we recreated the show Friends at one point \u2013 but this was on an old videotape recorder, and I don\u2019t even think my parents watched them.\u201d With Gavin, they have this vast record of his life online and on iCloud accounts. \u201cI think this makes growing up a whole different experience.\u201d</p> <p>In my family, my older sisters share a lot of photos and videos of their children via our family WhatsApp group. We live in different countries, so photo sharing is a good way to stay in touch. I have seen my nephews and nieces take first steps and sing the alphabet for the first time, to which I respond with heart emojis.</p> <p>But my eldest sister has misgivings about putting her children on more public forums. She and her husband have a rule not to post content on social media that shows their children\u2019s face. They want their children to be able to choose how they depict themselves online, to have agency over their digital record, rather than it being forged by their parents without consultation or consent.</p> <p>They also worry that if they posted content of their children, they might start analyzing their interactions with them through the lens of what gets more engagement. \u201cIf you\u2019re conditioned to feel your relationships are somehow improved by the number of likes you get, you\u2019re setting yourself up for difficult times ahead,\u201d my brother-in-law told me.</p> <p>While they feel that these rules have been useful so far, they still have questions and anxieties about the future. When is the right age to let children start posting their own content? What do they do if their friends post things about them online? \u201cThese are uncharted waters,\u201d my sister told me. \u201cAnd we\u2019re all just bumbling through.\u201d</p> <p>Like my sister, the Thomases are navigating their way through the ramifications of sharing a Truman Show-like record of their child. But the Thomases, like many other families, have allowed the world into their private photo album. In return, they experience an intensified version of what all proud families feel when they receive praise about their children.</p> <p>The trade-off for Gavin\u2019s life and how it unfolds is yet to be seen. What will growing up be like after the come down from a dopamine-rush childhood? What will be compromised in order sustain the high?</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s only eight, but internet fame has just kind of been the norm for him his whole life,\u201d Mastodon said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he fully understands what that means, and I don\u2019t think we do either. What I\u2019ve always kept in mind is what he will think in, like, 15 years. Will he be grateful? Will he say I wish my uncle hadn\u2019t have done that? I sometimes feel like we\u2019ve handed our kids a reality they didn\u2019t sign up for.\u201d</p>",

His grandfather had just passed away after a long battle with cancer, and his extended family gathered every Sunday to share a meal. Gavin was the only grandchild, the center of attention. The adults doted over him and shared photos of his early life via a joint iCloud account. One Sunday, Gavin\u2019s uncle, Nick Mastodon, took a video of Gavin putting stickers on his face and uploaded it to Vine, a recently launched video sharing platform. Mastodon was an early adopter and had gained a decent following making mash-ups of Disney movies and pop songs. Gavin\u2019s happy spontaneity struck a chord with Mastodon\u2019s followers, who demanded more toddler content. Gavin\u2019s mother, Kate Thomas, gave Mastodon permission to spend 20 minutes making videos with Gavin during their Sunday visits. The format was simple: Mastodon would act, and Gavin would react. In one video, Mastodon asks Gavin: \u201cWhat was your favorite part about going to the doctor today?\u201d Gavin responds: \u201cWhen I throwed up on my jacket.\u201d In another, Mastodon puts a gecko on Gavin\u2019s head and his face oscillates rapidly between anxiety and astonishment. By 2014, Mastodon\u2019s follower count had grown to just under 1 million. Mastodon and Kate thought the videos would be a brief internet craze and then fade into irrelevance. But then they started to notice people taking screenshots of Gavin\u2019s face to make reaction memes, such as a picture of Gavin with his arms crossed accompanied by the caption: \u201cHow ya mom be looking when you get home too late.\u201d Soon, the Gavin meme had taken on a life of its own. The people of the internet adopted Gavin and started to refer to him as \u201cour son\u201d. Gavin\u2019s dad, Adam, remained mostly oblivious to his son\u2019s fame until late 2017, when one of his colleagues noticed a framed picture of Gavin on his desk. \u201cOh my God, this is hilarious,\u201d he announced to the office. \u201cAdam has a picture of the meme kid on his desk.\u201d Confused, Adam responded that the boy in the picture was his child. \u201cYeah, I get the joke,\u201d his colleague said. \u201cHe\u2019s all of our kid. He\u2019s the internet\u2019s son.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Adam replied. \u201cThat\u2019s actually my child \u2013 he is my physical son.\u201d Gavin is now eight \u2013 a second-grader from a middle-class family in Minneapolis. His astonishing online fame led to opportunities his parents never imagined possible. The trade-off is a childhood played out in front of millions of strangers, the cost of which remains to be seen. I recently spent a weekend with Gavin, eager to learn how a seemingly normal family are dealing with the memeification of their only son. * * * When Kate picked me up from my hotel in downtown Minneapolis on a Friday afternoon, she had just collected Gavin from school. \u201cSay hello to Oscar, Gavs,\u201d Kate said. Reluctantly, Gavin gave me a high five, and then told Kate that he wanted to play Fortnite. \u201cMy phone doesn\u2019t have enough battery,\u201d she said. \u201cBut why don\u2019t we stop off and get you some Wendy\u2019s. You\u2019re probably just a bit tired and hungry.\u201d We were headed to the Winter Lights festival at the Arboretum, a botanical garden and function center on the outskirts of the city. Kate, who is 35, told me that her husband wouldn\u2019t be able to join us \u2013 he is in the military and was away for work. The plan for the evening was to shoot a video of Gavin making cookies with Kate\u2019s sister, who works as head chef at the Arboretum. Over the past few months, Gavin had started making regular vlogs to keep his fans updated about his life. Making these is part of a new content strategy developed by Gavin\u2019s manager, Byron Austen Ashley, who Kate began working with in December 2017. Previously, her strategy for managing Gavin\u2019s online following was haphazard. She had her own social media accounts where she uploaded pictures and videos of Gavin, but most Gavin content was being created by unaffiliated meme accounts, some of which were using his face to sell merchandise. Ashley began by telling Kate to start new social media accounts on Gavin\u2019s behalf and then hire a legal team to shut down the other meme accounts. Kate\u2019s accounts now have millions of followers across multiple online platforms and far greater control over the content that gets disseminated. At the Arboretum, Kate\u2019s sister said that she wouldn\u2019t have time to make a video with Gavin making cookies. \u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d Kate said, handing Gavin a digital camera attached to a small tripod. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go outside and make a video of the lights instead.\u201d \u201cWhat people seem to love about Gav is that he\u2019s just a normal kid,\u201d Kate said. \u201cSo, we just take videos of us out and about. And then I go through the footage later and decide what to upload, just like any proud mom.\u201d Once outside, Gavin, who had perked up since his Wendy\u2019s cheeseburger, hit record and took off into a field of snow with illuminated hay-barrels and barns, swinging the camera by his side. When I caught up, he asked if I wanted to play hide and go seek. \u201cSure,\u201d I said. \u201cOK, I\u2019ll hide first,\u201d he said. \u201cTake the camera.\u201d \u201cWhy do I need to take the camera?\u201d I asked. \u201cBecause then no one can see me.\u201d * * * Last year was huge for Gavin. He travelled to China twice, headed to New York to appear on Good Morning America, and in November, he made an appearance at the premier of Ralph Breaks the Internet in Los Angeles. \u201cThat was really amazing,\u201d Kate told me. \u201cThey invited other meme kids, like David After Dentist and Side Eye Chloe and Backpack Kid, so I got to meet their families and trade stories.\u201d I had reached out to several of these \u201cmeme kids\u201d and their families before meeting Gavin. For most, the experience of internet fame was a meteoric, short-lived experience. Such was the case for David Devore, better known as David After Dentist, whose dad shot a video of him while he was still high on pain medication after dental surgery when he was seven. The video went viral and Devore was briefly famous. \u201cNow I\u2019m a senior in high school and applying for college,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019m just a regular kid who plays lacrosse and works out. The whole thing is just kind of like a cool memory.\u201d But not all experiences of unwitting internet fame are so benign. The forebear of this type of celebrity was Ghyslain Raza, who in 2002, at the age of 14, filmed himself fighting imaginary sentries with a golf ball retriever in the media room at his high school. The footage was discovered by three classmates who uploaded it to Kazaa, a file-sharing network. The video was then discovered by blogger Andy Baio, who posted a copy on his popular blog, along with a remixed version that superimposed Star Wars graphics on to the footage. For 14-year-old Raza, the non-consensual online fame was horrifying. He was mercilessly bullied, lost the few friends he had, and ended up completing his final exams at a hospital psychiatric unit. While Baio retrospectively tried to cast Raza as an \u201cinternet hero\u201d, Raza felt like the internet was laughing at him, not with him. \u201cHaving your 15 minutes of fame, when you\u2019ve done something truly worthwhile, is one thing. When you earn it for something humiliating, that\u2019s entirely different,\u201d Raza said in 2013. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but feel worthless, like my life wasn\u2019t worth living.\u201d Kate says she is aware of the risks involved with Gavin being so young and so exposed. Someone once superimposed a Clorox label on a picture of Gavin drinking from a mug, making reference to a morbid suicide meme. Another time, a group of teenagers drove to Kate\u2019s mother\u2019s house and made a Vine outside. Since then, the Thomas\u2019s have taken steps to ensure their privacy and Gavin\u2019s safety. They don\u2019t reveal their surname publicly (\u201cThomas\u201d is an alias), never give out their address, and they have asked the school not to identify Gavin to anyone outside of the family. \u201cWe keep a close eye on everything,\u201d Kate told me. \u201cBut mostly, our followers are very nice and often protective. It really does feel like the whole internet is looking out for him, making sure he is drinking his milk, doing his homework. It feels special to see your boy loved by so many strangers.\u201d * * * The next morning, I met Gavin and Kate at the Mall of America, which has an indoor theme park, a mini-golf course, and movie cinemas. \u201cGav knows the social media team here,\u201d Kate told me. \u201cThey love it when he comes and hangs out, so they\u2019ve given us free passes to go on all the rides.\u201d Gavin was dressed in a yellow hoodie with a big picture of his own face on it, which would be available to buy via their new online shop in a few months. Kate is candid about how Gavin\u2019s internet fame could lead him to a career online. If making a living as an internet celebrity was inconceivable a decade ago, it is now a profession that many aspire to. At this stage, Kate told me, Gavin wants to be a YouTube gamer. The most successful ones \u2013 Markiplier, PewDiePie, Fernanfloo \u2013 earn millions of dollars each year and have more cultural influence among young people than traditional celebrities. To do this, Kate is taking direction from Ashley. They have enrolled him in acting classes and started teaching him how to edit video. They have also set up a Coogan account, a type of trust established in the 1930s to safeguard the money earned by child performers into adulthood. Arden Rose, one of Ashley\u2019s other clients, got her start making beauty-focused YouTube videos on her dad\u2019s laptop when she was 14 out of their suburban Arkansas home. She accumulated a devoted following online and leveraged this to become the lead actor in two successful TV series: Mr Student Body President and Guidance. She has since designed a jewelry collection, signed big product endorsements with Calvin Klein, authored a book published by HarperCollins, and splits her time between Los Angeles and London. Part of what makes internet celebrity so appealing is this sense of accessibility. Whereas being a movie star once required living in a certain place and having certain connections, being a YouTube star ostensibly only requires a camera and the internet. But this democratic access to fame that the internet affords comes at a cost. Last year, a number of high-profile YouTubers talked publicly about the pressure of constant online engagement. Elle Mills, a YouTuber who rose to fame in 2017 after posting a hugely popular \u201ccoming out\u201d video, uploaded a video to her channel in May entitled \u201cburnt out at 19\u201d. She confessed that the grind of producing new content and the emotional labor of interacting with her fans had left her anxious and depressed. Because Kate still runs Gavin\u2019s accounts on his behalf, his engagement with fans is carefully moderated. Yet occasionally, his celebrity spills out into the real world. As we walked around the mall, a number of teenagers took pictures of him from a distance. At one point, Gavin dropped his packet of caramel popcorn on the ground. \u201cOh no! What have you done, Gavin,\u201d said a young woman walking past. \u201cDo you think I can take a selfie with you?\u201d Gavin, popcornless and crestfallen, shook his head. Kate whispered something in his ear. He relinquished and went to stand next to the stranger, producing one of his signature faces, which sits ambiguously between a smile and a grimace. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty normal for us,\u201d Kate said as we made our way to the arcade. \u201cHe\u2019s been recognized in public since he was three. Here in Minnesota, people are pretty reserved and generally keep their distance. \u201cBut in China, it was a different story.\u201d Gavin and Kate made their first trip to China in August 2018, after the successful launch of Gavin\u2019s Weibo account \u2013 they gained over 1 million followers in the first day. A media team from GQ China followed him around Beijing and Chengdu, taking pictures of Gavin with his fans. Gavin and Kate returned to China in September after being invited to a technology conference hosted by Tencent, the biggest social network and gaming company in the country. This pivot to a Chinese audience started after Ashley was tipped off that Gavin\u2019s face was being used to sell mugs, posters, and clothing on Chinese e-commerce sites. Ashley\u2019s hunch, in his words, was to \u201clean in and capitalize\u201d. When I spoke to Ashley over the phone, he told me that the digital entertainment industry is far more advanced in China than it is in the US. He has been working on forging a number of brand deals for Gavin, including appearing in a hair product advertisement alongside his dad. It is this Chinese fanbase that now distinguishes Gavin from other meme kids. He is becoming less gimmick, more media personality. \u201cThere\u2019s a universe where he\u2019s the most relevant American celebrity in China,\u201d Byron told me. \u201cSome people would say he is already.\u201d I asked Kate what made her son so popular in China. \u201cI think it\u2019s his face,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there\u2019s something about it that is very relatable.\u201d Ashley also believes that Gavin\u2019s face is his most valuable asset in China \u2013 more specifically, the signature smile/grimace face. On Chinese social media, it is used as a meme to connote forced positivity in an otherwise uncomfortable situation. For example, people will post a picture of Gavin\u2019s smile with text that reads: \u201cI can\u2019t wait for school on Monday.\u201d So widespread is this meme that Gavin has become known by the Chinese media as \u201cthe boy with the fake smile\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re currently working on a strategy to protect this face,\u201d Ashley told me. \u201cThe case we\u2019re making is that the way that Gavin is shared is not so much as a person, but more as an emoji.\u201d * * * Gavin\u2019s uncle is now working as a creative at an advertising firm \u2013 a job he got in part because of his social media presence \u2013 so he has little time to make videos with Gavin. But they\u2019re still close and Mastodon feels a sense of responsibility for how Gavin\u2019s life is now unfolding. \u201cI think that social media makes being a kid and a parent a lot more complicated than it used to be,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhen we were kids, we used to make videos with our neighbors \u2013 I think we recreated the show Friends at one point \u2013 but this was on an old videotape recorder, and I don\u2019t even think my parents watched them.\u201d With Gavin, they have this vast record of his life online and on iCloud accounts. \u201cI think this makes growing up a whole different experience.\u201d In my family, my older sisters share a lot of photos and videos of their children via our family WhatsApp group. We live in different countries, so photo sharing is a good way to stay in touch. I have seen my nephews and nieces take first steps and sing the alphabet for the first time, to which I respond with heart emojis. But my eldest sister has misgivings about putting her children on more public forums. She and her husband have a rule not to post content on social media that shows their children\u2019s face. They want their children to be able to choose how they depict themselves online, to have agency over their digital record, rather than it being forged by their parents without consultation or consent. They also worry that if they posted content of their children, they might start analyzing their interactions with them through the lens of what gets more engagement. \u201cIf you\u2019re conditioned to feel your relationships are somehow improved by the number of likes you get, you\u2019re setting yourself up for difficult times ahead,\u201d my brother-in-law told me. While they feel that these rules have been useful so far, they still have questions and anxieties about the future. When is the right age to let children start posting their own content? What do they do if their friends post things about them online? \u201cThese are uncharted waters,\u201d my sister told me. \u201cAnd we\u2019re all just bumbling through.\u201d Like my sister, the Thomases are navigating their way through the ramifications of sharing a Truman Show-like record of their child. But the Thomases, like many other families, have allowed the world into their private photo album. In return, they experience an intensified version of what all proud families feel when they receive praise about their children. The trade-off for Gavin\u2019s life and how it unfolds is yet to be seen. What will growing up be like after the come down from a dopamine-rush childhood? What will be compromised in order sustain the high? \u201cHe\u2019s only eight, but internet fame has just kind of been the norm for him his whole life,\u201d Mastodon said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he fully understands what that means, and I don\u2019t think we do either. What I\u2019ve always kept in mind is what he will think in, like, 15 years. Will he be grateful? Will he say I wish my uncle hadn\u2019t have done that? I sometimes feel like we\u2019ve handed our kids a reality they didn\u2019t sign up for.\u201d",

She enjoyed long sabbaticals in the Sidney households, among books, sparkling literary and political companions and the classiest role models. But of course the best-educated women writers still faced social and artistic constraints.</p> <p>The Petrarchan tradition, for instance, favoured \u201cmasculine\u201d virtues: for the female protagonist, the only virtue in town was constancy. Wroth found a way round this restriction. Instead of opposing it, she rewrote constancy as an ideal virtue for the male lover, too.</p> <p>The poems this week are textual great-grandchildren of her never-finished prose romance<em> </em><a href=\"https://shakespeareandbeyond.folger.edu/2017/03/03/lady-mary-wroth-countess-of-montgomerys-urania/\">The Countess of Montgomery\u2019s Urania</a>. The romance includes the sonnet sequence, Pamphilia to Amphilanus, and this includes a 14-part Crown of Sonnets, the first three of which are shown above. I\u2019ve followed the modernised text of <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Poems.html?id=wSYgAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\">Lady Mary Wroth: Poems, edited by RE Pritchard</a>. There\u2019s a link to <a href=\"http://www.luminarium.org/renascence-editions/mary.html\">the whole sonnet sequence here</a>.</p> <p>Wroth\u2019s form neatly matches the thread-through-the-maze symbolism. The last line of each preceding sonnet becomes the first line of the next, and the first line of sonnet one becomes the final line of the last (14th) one. So after all her adventures, Pamphilia, a kind of female Theseus, is still <a href=\"https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Ariadne/ariadne.html\">lost in the labyrinth</a>, still pursuing that unreliable thread of Love that \u201cstraight leads unto the soul\u2019s content\u201d \u2013 rather than a hungry Minotaur.</p> <p>The diction is song-simple, the grammar compressed, the movement brisk. (There are poems designated \u201csongs\u201d at intervals elsewhere in the sequence, raising the possibility that sections of \u201cUrania\u201d were meant to be performed.) Wroth\u2019s allusions, to Greek myth, alchemy and so on are straightforward and familiar. Glimpses of the everyday social world in metaphor-friendly, shop-soiled terms such as \u201chire\u201d add something sparkier.</p> <p>The second sonnet initially follows an erotic thread: then \u201cchoice delights\u201d seem to mutate into \u201cchaste thoughts\u201d and the language turns a shade biblical. The third quatrain bonds secular and sacred in its imagery, as if Saint Paul had rewritten his sermon on charity to appeal to the contemporary courtier. It\u2019s probable, of course, that \u201cLove\u201d encodes not only divinity (Cupid\u2019s <em>and</em> God\u2019s) but curtseys towards the King and/or Queen. Nor should we forget Mary Wroth\u2019s lover, William Herbert, or the dedicatee of Urania, Countess Susan.</p> <p>The last sonnet is a curious one: again, I suspect Wroth is humming a tune as she writes. Each quatrain ends with the same set of rhyme-words, and the whole sonnet has only one rhyme. Pritchard points out that Philip Sidney has a mono-rhymed sonnet in Book Three of Arcadia. True, but the word is different in each line. Wroth sets herself a differently tricky task, and the effect is like strong sunlight, hard and piercing. Scansion seems to go haywire in lines 10 and 11, particularly 11, but I\u2019m convinced there\u2019s no want of skill: Wroth is simply making the sonnet jive a little, as she visualises the \u201cglorious light\u201d of mutual fidelity in the Court of Love.</p>",

Ways are on all sides, while the way I miss: If to the right hand, there, in love I burn; Let me go forward, therein danger is. If to the left, suspicion hinders bliss; Let me turn back, shame cries I ought return, Nor faint, though crosses with my fortune kiss; Stand still is harder, although sure to mourn. Thus let me take the right, or left hand way, Go forward, or stand still, or back retire: I must these doubts endure without allay Or help, but travail find for my best hire. Yet that which most my troubled sense doth move, Is to leave all, and take the thread of Love. 2. Is to leave all, and take the thread of Love, Which line straight leads unto the soul\u2019s content, Where choice delights with pleasure\u2019s wings do move, And idle fancy never room had lent. When chaste thoughts guide us, then our minds are bent To take that good which ills from us remove: Light of true love brings fruit which none repent, But constant lovers seek and wish to prove. Love is the shining star of blessing\u2019s light, The fervent fire of zeal, the root of peace, The lasting lamp, fed with the oil of right, Image of faith, and womb for joy\u2019s increase. Love is true virtue, and his ends delight; His flames are joys, his bands true lovers\u2019 might. 3. His flames are joys, his bands true lovers\u2019 might, No stain is there, but pure, as purest white, Where no cloud can appear to dim his light, Nor spot defile, but shame will soon requite. Here are affections tried by Love\u2019s just might As gold by fire, and black discerned by white, Error by truth, and darkness known by light, Where faith is valued, for Love to requite. Please him, and serve him, glory in his might And firm he\u2019ll be, as innocency white, Clear as th\u2019air, warm as sun\u2019s beams, as day light, Just as truth, constant as fate, joyed to requite. Then Love obey, strive to observe his might And be in his brave Court a glorious light.

Virginia Woolf famously imagined a gifted sister for William Shakespeare, giving her a sombrely brief life \u2013 which inspired this exhibition in 2012. As the daughter of Robert Sidney, and niece of Sir Philip and Mary, Countess of Pembroke, Mary Wroth, born in 1587, was far luckier than Shakespeare\u2019s sister. She enjoyed long sabbaticals in the Sidney households, among books, sparkling literary and political companions and the classiest role models. But of course the best-educated women writers still faced social and artistic constraints. The Petrarchan tradition, for instance, favoured \u201cmasculine\u201d virtues: for the female protagonist, the only virtue in town was constancy. Wroth found a way round this restriction. Instead of opposing it, she rewrote constancy as an ideal virtue for the male lover, too. The poems this week are textual great-grandchildren of her never-finished prose romance The Countess of Montgomery\u2019s Urania. The romance includes the sonnet sequence, Pamphilia to Amphilanus, and this includes a 14-part Crown of Sonnets, the first three of which are shown above. I\u2019ve followed the modernised text of Lady Mary Wroth: Poems, edited by RE Pritchard. There\u2019s a link to the whole sonnet sequence here. Wroth\u2019s form neatly matches the thread-through-the-maze symbolism. The last line of each preceding sonnet becomes the first line of the next, and the first line of sonnet one becomes the final line of the last (14th) one. So after all her adventures, Pamphilia, a kind of female Theseus, is still lost in the labyrinth, still pursuing that unreliable thread of Love that \u201cstraight leads unto the soul\u2019s content\u201d \u2013 rather than a hungry Minotaur. The diction is song-simple, the grammar compressed, the movement brisk. (There are poems designated \u201csongs\u201d at intervals elsewhere in the sequence, raising the possibility that sections of \u201cUrania\u201d were meant to be performed.) Wroth\u2019s allusions, to Greek myth, alchemy and so on are straightforward and familiar. Glimpses of the everyday social world in metaphor-friendly, shop-soiled terms such as \u201chire\u201d add something sparkier. The second sonnet initially follows an erotic thread: then \u201cchoice delights\u201d seem to mutate into \u201cchaste thoughts\u201d and the language turns a shade biblical. The third quatrain bonds secular and sacred in its imagery, as if Saint Paul had rewritten his sermon on charity to appeal to the contemporary courtier. It\u2019s probable, of course, that \u201cLove\u201d encodes not only divinity (Cupid\u2019s and God\u2019s) but curtseys towards the King and/or Queen. Nor should we forget Mary Wroth\u2019s lover, William Herbert, or the dedicatee of Urania, Countess Susan. The last sonnet is a curious one: again, I suspect Wroth is humming a tune as she writes. Each quatrain ends with the same set of rhyme-words, and the whole sonnet has only one rhyme. Pritchard points out that Philip Sidney has a mono-rhymed sonnet in Book Three of Arcadia. True, but the word is different in each line. Wroth sets herself a differently tricky task, and the effect is like strong sunlight, hard and piercing. Scansion seems to go haywire in lines 10 and 11, particularly 11, but I\u2019m convinced there\u2019s no want of skill: Wroth is simply making the sonnet jive a little, as she visualises the \u201cglorious light\u201d of mutual fidelity in the Court of Love.",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May would go back to Brussels with \u201cenormous firepower\u201d to renegotiate her Brexit deal if the Commons backed an amendment watering down the Irish backstop provision, a senior Conservative backbencher has said before a crucial series of votes. Graham Brady said he was hopeful of ministerial support for his amendment, which says the backstop should be replaced by \u201calternative arrangements to avoid a hard border\u201d, even though Ireland has repeatedly stressed such a change cannot happen. His is among a series of amendments intended to change the backstop that could be picked for voting on Tuesday night. Another group aims to prevent the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, if agreement cannot be reached in time. The most prominent of the amendments, tabled by the Labour MP Yvette Cooper, would oblige the government to extend the Brexit deadline if an agreement had not been struck by the end of next month. Nick Boles, the Tory backbencher who is pushing for the plan alongside Cooper, argued on Monday it was vital this amendment attract enough support to be passed. \u201cIf we don\u2019t seize the moment tomorrow afternoon then we\u2019re at grave risk of just driving off the edge on 29 March, without really wanting to, and when there might be a compromise that we could achieve if had a few more months,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. There is speculation that the government could formally back Brady\u2019s amendment, which is intended to bring back onboard the many Conservative and DUP MPs who voted against May\u2019s Brexit plan when it was overwhelmingly defeated in the Commons earlier this month. Much of the opposition centred around the backstop, the indefinite insurance policy that would keep Northern Ireland in customs alignment with the Irish Republic to avoid a hard border if no permanent deal or other arrangement could be found. The vote against May\u2019s deal \u201cdidn\u2019t necessarily indicate that the agreement is dead\u201d, Brady, who chairs the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, told Today, just that MPs had \u201ca very, very fundamental problem\u201d with the backstop.

This is it.\u201d However, the EU and Irish government have repeatedly stressed that the backstop cannot be watered down, as reiterated on Sunday by Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister and deputy prime minister. The backstop, \u201cas part of the withdrawal agreement, is part of a balanced package that isn\u2019t going to change\u201d, Coveney said. But Brady said he doubted the finality of such sentiments: \u201cWe are coming towards an end point, we are coming towards the exit date on 29 March. I think that is focusing minds. We\u2019ve already seen across the European Union a little bit more flexibility and a little bit more creativity creeping in.\u201d In his regular Daily Telegraph column on Monday, the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson argued that any changes to the backstop must be made to the withdrawal deal itself. Brady agreed that the change must be legally binding, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s going to accept something which is just warm words.\u201d The Cooper and Boles plan seems set to get formal support from Labour, but the government is unlikely to allow ministers a free vote. Some ministers, among them Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Gauke, are reported to be considering this to prevent the idea of a no-deal departure. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t want to see anyone resigning over this,\u201d Boles said. \u201cBut this is the last chance for parliament.

      "body": "<p>Fertility experts are urging the government to dump legislation that demands women who have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/22/fertility-experts-call-for-ditching-of-uks-10-year-limit-on-egg-freezing\">frozen their eggs must use them within 10 years</a>. After this time fertility clinics are obliged to destroy the eggs, irrespective of what the woman they belong to wants \u2013 unless she has been through the egg-freezing process because her fertility is compromised, which can happen for a number of reasons.</p> <p>The law at present dictates that any woman who has had her eggs frozen for \u201csocial\u201d reasons \u2013 that is, not medically indicated (for instance, she may not have met someone she wants to have children with yet) \u2013 has a maximum of 10 years in which to use them. Before we even begin to unpack the implications of such restrictions, though, the term \u201csocial\u201d in itself warrants our attention. Pejorative is putting it lightly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When it comes to women\u2019s bodies, in so many areas, our voice and our autonomy continue to be the weakest currencies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It often feels like one of nature\u2019s cruellest tricks that a woman must remain aware of her declining fertility before she is ready to actually contemplate the reality of having a baby, but that is our biological lot. We <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/08/women-need-more-realistic-data-on-egg-freezing-success-say-experts\">increasingly turn to options such as egg and embryo-freezing</a> to give ourselves more time and recourse. The idea that making use of technological advances and giving ourselves some hope for the future, in light of something we cannot control, could be deemed as \u201csocial\u201d is frankly laughable. </p> <p>Since 2010 there has been a rapid increase in the number of women choosing to freeze their eggs. This most often happens through private clinics at an eye-watering cost, because the NHS will only offer egg-freezing to women who are medically compromised. The private sector <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/ivf-clinics-infertility-parents-pregnancy-embryo-cyprus-uk-prague-spain-czech-republic-a8303721.html\">monetises women\u2019s hope</a> and has continued to do so in spite of a lack of robust data on any future success the process might bring. Cryopreservation tanks don\u2019t just contain our eggs, they contain our fragile and perhaps sometimes misguided faith.</p> <p>An extensive report from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority <a href=\"https://www.hfea.gov.uk/about-us/news-and-press-releases/2018-news-and-press-releases/what-you-need-to-know-about-our-new-egg-freezing-report/\">published at the end of last year</a> made it clear that chances of success are much higher if a woman freezes her eggs before 35, when she still has good fertility. At present, 38 is the most common age women choose to do it. The report also made clear that the birthrate for women using their own frozen eggs was 18%, which is much lower than the 26% success rate of IVF. The HFEA chair, Sally Cheshire, was clear that women should be fully informed about what to expect: \u201cEgg-freezing cycles and subsequent thawing still account for only 1-2% of all IVF treatment cycles, and even fewer result in a baby being born.\u201d</p> <p>Even if we take this information into account and women, feeling the hot breath of time, begin choosing to freeze their eggs earlier, the law dictates a set timeframe within which we can use them. On the most basic level, how can that be right? As Baroness Ruth Deech, the British bioethicist and politician who was chair of the HFEA from 1994 to 2002, and is one of the most vocal campaigners for a change in this law says, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46923329\">the limit is \u201carbitrary\u201d</a> and not in keeping with the technology that now means eggs can be safely frozen indefinitely.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VictoriaLIVE/status/1087664122576003072\">interview</a> with BBC Two\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire, Deech said a change in legislation would \u201cbe very easy to do, wouldn\u2019t cost anything and would give hope to women. There is nothing medically wrong with it, and I simply cannot see why the government won\u2019t give this attention.\u201d The government is, in fact, disregarding how this current law breeches human rights law. But why consider the paltry matter of human rights when you\u2019re afraid of upsetting your hoary backbenchers? Recalling a meeting with health minister Jackie Doyle-Price, Deech said, \u201cI think she was frightened the anti-abortionists would pile in.\u201d</p> <p>I find this insight as frightening as I do depressing because the naked fact of all this is that, when it comes to women\u2019s bodies, in so many areas, our voice and our autonomy continue to be the weakest currencies. Someone always claims to knows better \u2013 usually a powerful man. But this law is flagrantly discriminatory towards women trying to take charge of their reproductive systems.</p> <p>We don\u2019t say that men are only allowed to store their sperm for 10 years before it\u2019s destroyed. </p> <p>Yet no decision related to women\u2019s health could ever be a matter of simple human conscience.

      "bodyText": "Fertility experts are urging the government to dump legislation that demands women who have frozen their eggs must use them within 10 years. After this time fertility clinics are obliged to destroy the eggs, irrespective of what the woman they belong to wants \u2013 unless she has been through the egg-freezing process because her fertility is compromised, which can happen for a number of reasons. The law at present dictates that any woman who has had her eggs frozen for \u201csocial\u201d reasons \u2013 that is, not medically indicated (for instance, she may not have met someone she wants to have children with yet) \u2013 has a maximum of 10 years in which to use them. Before we even begin to unpack the implications of such restrictions, though, the term \u201csocial\u201d in itself warrants our attention. Pejorative is putting it lightly. It often feels like one of nature\u2019s cruellest tricks that a woman must remain aware of her declining fertility before she is ready to actually contemplate the reality of having a baby, but that is our biological lot. We increasingly turn to options such as egg and embryo-freezing to give ourselves more time and recourse. The idea that making use of technological advances and giving ourselves some hope for the future, in light of something we cannot control, could be deemed as \u201csocial\u201d is frankly laughable. Since 2010 there has been a rapid increase in the number of women choosing to freeze their eggs. This most often happens through private clinics at an eye-watering cost, because the NHS will only offer egg-freezing to women who are medically compromised. The private sector monetises women\u2019s hope and has continued to do so in spite of a lack of robust data on any future success the process might bring. Cryopreservation tanks don\u2019t just contain our eggs, they contain our fragile and perhaps sometimes misguided faith. An extensive report from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority published at the end of last year made it clear that chances of success are much higher if a woman freezes her eggs before 35, when she still has good fertility. At present, 38 is the most common age women choose to do it. The report also made clear that the birthrate for women using their own frozen eggs was 18%, which is much lower than the 26% success rate of IVF. The HFEA chair, Sally Cheshire, was clear that women should be fully informed about what to expect: \u201cEgg-freezing cycles and subsequent thawing still account for only 1-2% of all IVF treatment cycles, and even fewer result in a baby being born.\u201d Even if we take this information into account and women, feeling the hot breath of time, begin choosing to freeze their eggs earlier, the law dictates a set timeframe within which we can use them. On the most basic level, how can that be right? As Baroness Ruth Deech, the British bioethicist and politician who was chair of the HFEA from 1994 to 2002, and is one of the most vocal campaigners for a change in this law says, the limit is \u201carbitrary\u201d and not in keeping with the technology that now means eggs can be safely frozen indefinitely. In an interview with BBC Two\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire, Deech said a change in legislation would \u201cbe very easy to do, wouldn\u2019t cost anything and would give hope to women. There is nothing medically wrong with it, and I simply cannot see why the government won\u2019t give this attention.\u201d The government is, in fact, disregarding how this current law breeches human rights law. But why consider the paltry matter of human rights when you\u2019re afraid of upsetting your hoary backbenchers? Recalling a meeting with health minister Jackie Doyle-Price, Deech said, \u201cI think she was frightened the anti-abortionists would pile in.\u201d I find this insight as frightening as I do depressing because the naked fact of all this is that, when it comes to women\u2019s bodies, in so many areas, our voice and our autonomy continue to be the weakest currencies. Someone always claims to knows better \u2013 usually a powerful man. But this law is flagrantly discriminatory towards women trying to take charge of their reproductive systems. We don\u2019t say that men are only allowed to store their sperm for 10 years before it\u2019s destroyed. Yet no decision related to women\u2019s health could ever be a matter of simple human conscience. Not with centuries of historical stigma that still lingers where we rely on other powers to make things better for us. I have spent the last year researching and writing a book about exactly this, and it\u2019s been less eye-opening than dura mater-splitting. We know that medicine has an inherent bias against women; that women presenting with pain are not only given fewer painkillers than men but are often offered sedatives instead (because we\u2019re easier when we\u2019re quieter); that treatment for women with coronary heart disease is delayed compared to men. When we say what we want or need, someone \u2013 usually a man, or a system founded by a man \u2013 always knows better. Just this month we have learned that, for 60 years, women have been taking the contraceptive pill with the recommended seven-day break completely unnecessarily.

      "body": "<p>The US has begun making a new, low-yield nuclear warhead for its Trident missiles that arms control advocates warn could lower the threshold for a nuclear conflict.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/nnsa/national-nuclear-security-administration\">National Nuclear Security Administration</a> (NNSA) announced in an email it had started manufacturing the weapon at its Pantex nuclear weapons plant in Texas, as ordered by Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2018/Feb/02/2001872886/-1/-1/1/2018-NUCLEAR-POSTURE-REVIEW-FINAL-REPORT.PDF\">nuclear posture review</a> (NPR) last year.</p> <p>The NNSA said the first of the new warheads had come off the production line and that it was on schedule to deliver the first batch \u2013 an unspecified number referred to as \u201cinitial operational capability\u201d \u2013 before the end of September, according to the email, first sent in response to an enquiry from<a href=\"https://www.exchangemonitor.com/issues/weapons_complex_monitor_vol_30_no_04/\"> Exchange Monitor</a>, which covers the nuclear weapons complex. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/09/us-to-loosen-nuclear-weapons-policy-and-develop-more-usable-warheads\">US to loosen nuclear weapons constraints and develop more 'usable' warheads</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The new weapon, the W76-2, is a modification of the existing Trident warhead. Stephen Young, a senior Washington representative of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said its yield had most likely been cut by taking away one stage from the original two-stage, W76 thermonuclear device.</p> <p>\u201cAs best we can tell, the only requirement is to replace the existing secondary, or second stage, with a dummy version, which is what they do every time they test fly a missile,\u201d Young said, adding that the amount of tritium, a hydrogen isotope, may also be adjusted.

      "bodyText": "The US has begun making a new, low-yield nuclear warhead for its Trident missiles that arms control advocates warn could lower the threshold for a nuclear conflict. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) announced in an email it had started manufacturing the weapon at its Pantex nuclear weapons plant in Texas, as ordered by Donald Trump\u2019s nuclear posture review (NPR) last year. The NNSA said the first of the new warheads had come off the production line and that it was on schedule to deliver the first batch \u2013 an unspecified number referred to as \u201cinitial operational capability\u201d \u2013 before the end of September, according to the email, first sent in response to an enquiry from Exchange Monitor, which covers the nuclear weapons complex. The new weapon, the W76-2, is a modification of the existing Trident warhead. Stephen Young, a senior Washington representative of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said its yield had most likely been cut by taking away one stage from the original two-stage, W76 thermonuclear device. \u201cAs best we can tell, the only requirement is to replace the existing secondary, or second stage, with a dummy version, which is what they do every time they test fly a missile,\u201d Young said, adding that the amount of tritium, a hydrogen isotope, may also be adjusted. The result would be to reduce its explosive power from 100 kilotons of TNT, to about five \u2013 approximately a third of the force of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The Trump administration has argued the development of a low-yield weapon would make nuclear war less likely, by giving the US a more flexible deterrent. It would counter any enemy (particularly Russian) perception that the US would balk at using its own fearsome arsenal in response to a limited nuclear attack because its missiles were all in the hundreds of kilotons range and \u201ctoo big to use\u201d, because they would cause untold civilian casualties. Low-yield weapons \u201chelp ensure that potential adversaries perceive no possible advantage in limited nuclear escalation, making nuclear employment less likely\u201d, the 2018 nuclear posture review said. Many critics say that is an optimistic scenario that assumes there will be no miscalculation on the US side. \u201cThere are many other scenarios, especially with a president who takes pride in his unpredictability and has literally asked: \u2018Why can\u2019t we use our nuclear weapons?\u2019\u201d, Young said. Melissa Hanham of the One Earth Future foundation pointed out that adversaries would have no way of knowing if a full-force Trident was being fired at them, or its low-yield cousin. \u201cHey all you nuclear powers out there. We\u2019re just going to trust that you recognize this is \u201cjust a little nuclear weapon\u201d and won\u2019t retaliate with all you\u2019ve got,\u201d Hanham wrote in a tweet. \u201cRemember! The US only intends to nuke you \u201ca little bit.\u201d\u201d Hans Kristensen, the director of the nuclear information project at the Federation of American Scientists said the new warhead marked a sharp break from the Obama administration policy of making no new weapons or capabilities. He said it risked starting an arms race with Russia involving smaller nuclear weapons. \u201cTo what extent does this signal a new willingness on the part of the US to start using strategic nuclear weapons in a tactical and very limited way early in a potential conflict?\u201d Kristensen asked. \u201cFrankly, mission creep is my greatest worry about this.\u201d There has been a spate of developments signalling that a new arms race is gathering pace.

Trump has declared he will take the US out of the treaty, and the administration is expected to suspend compliance and serve six months\u2019 notice of withdrawal on Saturday.

Minutes after their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/26/afc-wimbledon-west-ham-fa-cup-match-report\">defeat by AFC Wimbledon</a> was confirmed on Saturday night the club\u2019s Twitter account announced their star forward <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/26/manuel-pellegrini-ashamed-west-ham-afc-wimbledon-fa-cup-marko-arnautovic-new-contract\">had signed a contract extension</a>. \u201cI glad [sic] to play again, show myself and score goals, to make assists,\u201d said Marko Arnautovic, who had been linked with a move to China. \u201cBut also to say that the major point is Marko Arnautovic never refused [to play or train]. I would never refuse.\u201d The Austrian was nowhere to be seen at Kingsmeadow as West Ham failed to reach the fifth round for the third successive season but he is expected to be in contention to face Wolves on Tuesday having made only three appearances in 2019. Yet after he appeared so willing to leave West Ham to \u201cwin titles\u201d in China, one has to doubt whether Arnautovic will stick around much longer. <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"30c2e1a3-40fa-43cd-9662-422a057b9e7d\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022 <b>Scott Wagstaff</b>, who scored twice for AFC Wimbledon against West Ham, had scored twice in his previous 44 appearances in all competitions.</p>\n    <p>\u2022 <b>Manchester City</b> have won all seven of their games in 2019, scoring 30 times in the process.</p>\n    <p>\u2022 <b>Millwall</b> are the first club from outside the top division to win <br> five consecutive FA Cup home games against top division sides since West Ham between 1958 and 1991.</p>\n    <p>\u2022 <b>Jake Cooper</b>, who brought Millwall level at 2-2, has been directly involved in nine goals in 17 home games this season, more than any other defender in England\u2019s top four divisions.</p>\n    <p>\u2022 As a result of their 4-1 win over Gillingham, <b>Swansea City</b> reached the last 16 of the FA Cup in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1963-64 and 1964-65.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>3) Solskj\u00e6r tactical tweaks show a proper manager at work</h2> \n<p>Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r gave a little tactical insight with the nonchalance of a kid solving a Rubik\u2019s Cube with one hand whirring away while staring casually into the middle distance. The matter in question was the posting of Romelu Lukaku down the right channel. Solskj\u00e6r proved his eye for strategic awareness by identifying the need to put someone physically strong against the barrelling Sead Kolasinac \u2013 one of Arsenal\u2019s most productive instigators of attacks \u2013 while also noting the opposition full-backs leave spaces to exploit. Bingo. Lukaku was highly influential, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/25/arsenal-manchester-united-fa-cup-match-report\">creating two goals</a> with precision passes for Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Jesse Lingard, while also nullifying a threat. Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s shrewd choices and calm explanations provide further evidence there is more to this situation than an old friend turning up and making everyone feel happy. He means business. <strong>Amy Lawrence</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af42122f4c6cc2fe534e5375fa8b064ccf8b4692\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af42122f4c6cc2fe534e5375fa8b064ccf8b4692/0_139_2119_1271/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r saw his Manchester United side defeat Arsenal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r saw his Manchester United side defeat Arsenal</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Purslow/Man Utd via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>4) Higua\u00edn on the wrong frequency</h2> \n<p>Gonzalo Higua\u00edn was energetic and whole-hearted, super-keen to make an impression on his Chelsea debut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/27/chelsea-sheffield-wednesday-fa-cup-match-report\">against Sheffield Wednesday</a>; to illuminate his first appearance in English club football with something special. It did not happen. The service from a Chelsea midfield which saw three different players tried in the role in front of the back four was poor but what stood out was that understanding would not come instantly. \u201cHe made a couple of great moves in the first half but we couldn\u2019t find the right ball,\u201d Gianfranco Zola, the Chelsea assistant manager, said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t see his movements.\u201d A number of quality players <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/27/shevchenko-morata-higuain-chelsea-strikers-failed\">have laboured in the role of Chelsea No 9</a> \u2013 even Eden Hazard \u2013 and it is because it is a tough gig; heavy on workload, surprisingly low on touches. It will be fascinating to see whether Higua\u00edn can make the necessary adjustments in the coming weeks. <strong>David Hytner</strong></p> \n<h2>5) Spurs\u2019 substitutes not up to scratch against Palace</h2> \n<p>Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s decision to leave Christian Eriksen out of his squad was a factor in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/27/crystal-palace-tottenham-fa-cup-match-report\">Spurs\u2019 defeat at Selhurst Park</a> but it was understandable with the Dane having played 90 minutes against Chelsea on Thursday, a testing Premier League match against Watford on Wednesday, Borussia Dortmund on the horizon, and the very real risk of losing him to injury amid Harry Kane\u2019s and Dele Alli\u2019s enforced absences. With Lucas Moura, \u00c9rik Lamela and Fernando Llorente, Pochettino still had enough attacking options to beat Palace but was let down by his players up against a Palace central defensive pair who have played only one game together this season. That Spurs did not score is testament to Martin Kelly, Scott Dann and Roy Hodgson\u2019s coaching but also how disappointing Lucas, Llorente and Lamela, as a second-half substitute, were. <strong>James Piercy</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b58e36a271301257589e4306e45c6dfa2ceccfaa\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b58e36a271301257589e4306e45c6dfa2ceccfaa/86_135_2680_1846/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tottenham\u2019s Lucas Moura did not find much joy against the Crystal Palace defence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tottenham\u2019s Lucas Moura did not find much joy against the Crystal Palace defence.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images via Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>6) Guardiola admits desire to emulate Barcelona</strong></h2> \n<p>For Pep Guardiola the challenge for Manchester City is clear \u2013 try to \u201cimitate Barcelona, Juventus and Bayern Munich\u201d by relentlessly competing for trophies. This was the manager\u2019s mantra after City <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/26/manchester-city-burnley-fa-cup-match-report\">cuffed Burnley aside 5-0</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s important in January we are there,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cThe big clubs, that is the big difference \u2013 Juventus, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, these are the best teams in the last decade in Europe: why? Because every season they win the league, every season they win the cups, every season they are there [competing]. It\u2019s [very] difficult to imitate them. So Premier League until the end, Carabao Cup final after [winning it last season] \u2013 chapeau, hats off for my players. Through in the FA Cup, prepare to play Schalke in the Champions League [next month]. That\u2019s when you become a better team, a better club.\u201d <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>7) </strong><strong>Dolan strikes and then pays respect to mentor</strong></h2> \n<p>Dave Parnaby could not hide his disappointment when the team-sheets were distributed. The former head of Middlesbrough\u2019s academy had hoped to watch one of his old prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Matty Dolan, play in midfield for Newport.

Equally Silva finds himself on increasingly icy ground after seven defeats in 12 games with the most recent being the worst.

We have 15 games now to play in the league and we have to be sure everyone is focused and no distractions.

Wolves completed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/26/shrewsbury-town-wolves-fa-cup-match-report\">their comeback from two goals down</a> in the 93rd minute to deflate Shrewsbury and prompt criticism of an injury time that was surprising and costly. Ball boys were moved for their own safety when trouble broke out between rival fans after Luke Waterfall\u2019s 71st-minute goal for the League One side. But there were no prolonged breaks in play as a consequence and only those ball boys close to the scuffles were shifted. It did not explain six minutes of stoppage time in a Cup tie featuring six substitutions and no physio involvement, although it was a stretch to claim that was the cause of Shrewsbury\u2019s heartache. While Wolves were given fresh impetus by the time-keeping, it was Shrewsbury\u2019s inability to hold out for the win that lay at the root of Ricketts\u2019 anger.<strong> </strong><strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks. \n </figcaption> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "1) Accrington manager misses magic of the Cup It was a pity John Coleman saw fit to savage Jon Moss, stealing the headlines when his players\u2019 tremendous performance against Derby deserved more attention. The referee did not get everything right but the Accrington manager was wrong to describe his decisions as horrendous, particularly as his supposedly worst call only led to the corner that resulted in the goal. Frank Lampard was on safer ground talking of the magic of the FA Cup. \u201cWe had 2,500 fans here and I thought it was great, it felt like a proper game,\u201d the Derby manager said. \u201cI\u2019ve played in Cup ties like that for Chelsea, we won 1-0 at Scarborough a few years back and by no means were we the much better team. This was difficult, it was real football, and I\u2019m glad my players experienced it. That\u2019s the beauty of the FA Cup, it\u2019s not just about winning the final, it\u2019s about adapting to new challenges and different conditions. I enjoyed being a part of it.\u201d Paul Wilson 2) Arnautovic adds to West Ham\u2019s strange Saturday Even by West Ham\u2019s standards the timing was curious. Minutes after their defeat by AFC Wimbledon was confirmed on Saturday night the club\u2019s Twitter account announced their star forward had signed a contract extension. \u201cI glad [sic] to play again, show myself and score goals, to make assists,\u201d said Marko Arnautovic, who had been linked with a move to China. \u201cBut also to say that the major point is Marko Arnautovic never refused [to play or train]. I would never refuse.\u201d The Austrian was nowhere to be seen at Kingsmeadow as West Ham failed to reach the fifth round for the third successive season but he is expected to be in contention to face Wolves on Tuesday having made only three appearances in 2019. Yet after he appeared so willing to leave West Ham to \u201cwin titles\u201d in China, one has to doubt whether Arnautovic will stick around much longer. Ed Aarons 3) Solskj\u00e6r tactical tweaks show a proper manager at work Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r gave a little tactical insight with the nonchalance of a kid solving a Rubik\u2019s Cube with one hand whirring away while staring casually into the middle distance. The matter in question was the posting of Romelu Lukaku down the right channel. Solskj\u00e6r proved his eye for strategic awareness by identifying the need to put someone physically strong against the barrelling Sead Kolasinac \u2013 one of Arsenal\u2019s most productive instigators of attacks \u2013 while also noting the opposition full-backs leave spaces to exploit. Bingo. Lukaku was highly influential, creating two goals with precision passes for Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Jesse Lingard, while also nullifying a threat. Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s shrewd choices and calm explanations provide further evidence there is more to this situation than an old friend turning up and making everyone feel happy. He means business. Amy Lawrence 4) Higua\u00edn on the wrong frequency Gonzalo Higua\u00edn was energetic and whole-hearted, super-keen to make an impression on his Chelsea debut against Sheffield Wednesday; to illuminate his first appearance in English club football with something special. It did not happen. The service from a Chelsea midfield which saw three different players tried in the role in front of the back four was poor but what stood out was that understanding would not come instantly. \u201cHe made a couple of great moves in the first half but we couldn\u2019t find the right ball,\u201d Gianfranco Zola, the Chelsea assistant manager, said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t see his movements.\u201d A number of quality players have laboured in the role of Chelsea No 9 \u2013 even Eden Hazard \u2013 and it is because it is a tough gig; heavy on workload, surprisingly low on touches. It will be fascinating to see whether Higua\u00edn can make the necessary adjustments in the coming weeks. David Hytner 5) Spurs\u2019 substitutes not up to scratch against Palace Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s decision to leave Christian Eriksen out of his squad was a factor in Spurs\u2019 defeat at Selhurst Park but it was understandable with the Dane having played 90 minutes against Chelsea on Thursday, a testing Premier League match against Watford on Wednesday, Borussia Dortmund on the horizon, and the very real risk of losing him to injury amid Harry Kane\u2019s and Dele Alli\u2019s enforced absences. With Lucas Moura, \u00c9rik Lamela and Fernando Llorente, Pochettino still had enough attacking options to beat Palace but was let down by his players up against a Palace central defensive pair who have played only one game together this season. That Spurs did not score is testament to Martin Kelly, Scott Dann and Roy Hodgson\u2019s coaching but also how disappointing Lucas, Llorente and Lamela, as a second-half substitute, were. James Piercy 6) Guardiola admits desire to emulate Barcelona For Pep Guardiola the challenge for Manchester City is clear \u2013 try to \u201cimitate Barcelona, Juventus and Bayern Munich\u201d by relentlessly competing for trophies. This was the manager\u2019s mantra after City cuffed Burnley aside 5-0. \u201cIt\u2019s important in January we are there,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cThe big clubs, that is the big difference \u2013 Juventus, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, these are the best teams in the last decade in Europe: why? Because every season they win the league, every season they win the cups, every season they are there [competing]. It\u2019s [very] difficult to imitate them. So Premier League until the end, Carabao Cup final after [winning it last season] \u2013 chapeau, hats off for my players. Through in the FA Cup, prepare to play Schalke in the Champions League [next month]. That\u2019s when you become a better team, a better club.\u201d Jamie Jackson 7) Dolan strikes and then pays respect to mentor Dave Parnaby could not hide his disappointment when the team-sheets were distributed. The former head of Middlesbrough\u2019s academy had hoped to watch one of his old prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Matty Dolan, play in midfield for Newport. Dolan, though, was feeling his way back from hamstring trouble and began on the bench, leaving Parnaby, watching from the press box, to wait 87 minutes for his introduction. And what a bow it was too \u2013 in the fourth minute of stoppage time, a swipe of Dolan\u2019s left foot made it 1-1, setting the scene for an evocative replay at Rodney Parade. The Teessider left Boro without making a first-team appearance and seemed slightly startled to find himself addressing a post-match media conference but, tellingly, Dolan spent a fair percentage of it praising Parnaby\u2019s influence on his career. Louise Taylor 8) Silva has to prove he can learn from mistakes Just over a year since Marco Silva was sacked by Watford there are no strong suggestions he is going to suffer the same fate at Everton any time soon. Equally Silva finds himself on increasingly icy ground after seven defeats in 12 games with the most recent being the worst. There was an element of injustice to Everton\u2019s defeat by Millwall given the handball involved in Jake Cooper\u2019s goal but, regardless, they deserved little given how poorly they defended at set pieces and how little they offered in attack. And therein lies a major problem for Silva \u2013 Everton\u2019s failings keep repeating themselves, fuelling the belief held by an increasing number of observers that he is a manager incapable of learning from his mistakes.

      "body": "<p>On 6 December 2018, game developer Chris Hunt\u2019s magnum opus was finally complete. Hunt had been working on <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/233860/Kenshi/\">Kenshi</a>, in which players navigate a tribe of people through a strange, low-tech alien world, for more than 10 years. You might think finishing it would be a huge milestone in Hunt\u2019s career. But if anything, the opposite is true.</p> <p>\u201cNo one was really bothered by the official release, because nothing will change,\u201d says Hunt, who speaks in a laid-back, laconic fashion that makes him seem affable and yet strangely distant. \u201cPeople kept saying, \u2018Ah, don\u2019t release it too soon.\u2019 I think they were worried that I was going to leave it buggy or incomplete.\u201d</p> <p>This bizarre situation has emerged because, despite being a decade in the making, Kenshi has been playable for half that time, and already has thousands of fans. Kenshi belongs to a sub-group of \u201cEarly Access\u201d games on the biggest <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/\">online PC games storefront, Steam</a>. Through the platform, developers can release their games in an unfinished state, and use the revenue raised from purchases to fund the remainder of development. It can be likened to crowdfunding, although rather than investing on a promise, purchasers of the games can play along as development progresses.</p> <p>Kenshi was one of 12 games selected to launch the initiative in March 2013. Of those, nine have been finished, two have ceased development, and one is stuck in limbo. Alongside Kenshi, the released games are Kerbal Space Program, ARMA 3, Prison Architect, Drunken Robot Pornography, Gnomoria , Gear Up, Starforge and Kinetic Void.</p> <p><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/genre/Early%20Access/\">Steam Early Access</a> facilitates projects that would be otherwise impossible to produce. But it raises questions about the relationship between developers and customers, and the responsibilities of Steam\u2019s owner, <a href=\"https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/\">Valve Corporation</a>, to monitor what\u2019s going on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e49b12ee894145b4aad4cad121bcacdb880cfa03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e49b12ee894145b4aad4cad121bcacdb880cfa03/0_0_1904_1042/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kenshi Game\" width=\"1000\" height=\"547\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A screenshot from Kenshi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although Kenshi was one of the first Early Access games, its story begins much earlier. So long ago, in fact, that Hunt cannot remember exactly when he began working on it. \u201cI\u2019ve been designing games since I was a kid,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d play a bunch, get inspired and start designing on paper. [Kenshi] came from a lifetime of playing games.\u201d</p> <p>Kenshi is a role-playing-game, although it interprets that idea more literally than most. Players don\u2019t become some fantasy hero destined for glory, the familiar Dungeons and Dragons triptych of warrior, mage or rogue. Instead, they can be anything they like within Kenshi\u2019s vast and strange world: a trader, a farmer, a bandit, a thief. It\u2019s a game about forging your own path in a world indifferent to your success or failure. Opportunities are many, but risks are also high, and a character\u2019s story can come to a swift end courtesy of vicious wildlife or roaming groups of bandits.</p> <p>Hunt had put five years into Kenshi before Steam launched its Early Access section, much of that time as a full-time solo developer. He had even started selling prototype copies, using services such as Desura and his own website. When Valve began searching for games to feature, Kenshi was ahead of the pack. \u201cKenshi looks really good on a store-page, because it\u2019s just a huge list of dreamlike features,\u201d says Hunt. \u201cIt had a fanbase, and it was pretty far along in development.\u201d</p> <p>Steam has been vital in supporting Kenshi\u2019s development, being responsible for 95% of all its sales. At the same time, the sheer exposure of being on Steam is also responsible for 95% of Hunt\u2019s stress and worry. \u201cYou have to really be ready to release in Early Access, because people will come down on you like a hammer,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get a wave of people judging you instantly. Every single bug is a panic.\u201d</p> <p>When customers are paying for an unfinished product, expectations are high. Hunt believes one of the reasons Kenshi has maintained its development for so long is through constant communication and regular updates. \u201cIf we did an update every four months, then everyone would get angry and during that gap would be saying, \u2018The game\u2019s abandoned!\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut if we did the same amount of work, but broke it up into an update every day, people felt it was really well maintained.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But supporting an unfinished game\u2019s development with its sales over several years is not easy. \u201cThere was one point in development where I handed everyone their notices,\u201d Hunt says. \u201cWe were completely running out of money.\u201d Hunt planned to continue working on the game alone, reducing its overall scope. Then sales suddenly picked up, and it was back to business as usual.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d033356152b7d3e5a786f2d2a0f2df90af762890\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d033356152b7d3e5a786f2d2a0f2df90af762890/0_0_1467_815/1000.png\" alt=\"Screen shot of the game Under the Ocean\" width=\"1000\" height=\"556\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Failure to survive \u2026 a screenshot of the game Under the Ocean.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steamcommunity.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not every project has been so fortunate. Another game from the initial batch was Under the Ocean, a subaquatic survival game developed by New Zealand-based artist Paul Hart and programmer Mike Reitzenstein. Boasting a unique art style and a setting that distinguished it from other survival games at the time, Under the Ocean was one of Steam\u2019s most interesting prospects.</p> <p>But the project ran into trouble about a year into development. \u201cWith previous games, Mike and I had a very focused vision, with little outside influence,\u201d says Hart. \u201cBut with Early Access we modified our vision to fit feedback.\u201d One of these modifications was to make each update to the game themed around a specific idea or feature, in the hopes of attracting an influx of new buyers. But the pair found the process disruptive, and in early 2015, Reitzenstein decided to leave the project. This left Hart without a programmer, and thereby without any realistic chance of finishing the game. Not long after, he made the decision to delist Under the Ocean from Steam.</p> <p>\u201cA big part of why I hesitated cancelling the project earlier is the disappointment of letting the player-base down,\u201d Hart says. This is the risk developers take with Early Access. An unfinished project is always disappointing for its creator. But when thousands of other people play a role in funding that project, the disappointment is magnified many times over, and with it comes a burden of neglected responsibility.</p> <p>Hart continued working on the game for the next three years, at weekends, but finally decided to cancel the project a couple of months ago. Throughout, Hart has tried to maintain goodwill with the game\u2019s remaining fanbase, offering free copies of his other games to owners of Under the Ocean \u2013 and, more unusually, promising free copies of games he plans to make in the future.</p> <p>Under the Ocean may have failed, but Hart has done all he can to make the best of an unfortunate situation. The same cannot be said of every Early Access title. Patterns, a game by Second Life developer Linden Labs, <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/games/218980/announcements/detail/137683030771228431\">unceremoniously ceased development</a> in 2014, sparking much ire.

It launched on Early Access in March 2013 alongside Kenshi, Under the Ocean and Patterns. Nearly six years later, the game remains available to purchase for \u00a36.99 \u2013 but no progress has been made on its development.</p> <p>Dejobaan was contacted several times for comment, asking about the game\u2019s current state and whether there were any plans for further release. There was no response. The last official update <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/app/15540/discussions/0/34095132084095966/\">occurred in August 2014</a>. Dejobaan\u2019s founder, Ichiro Lambe, apologised for the delays in production, stating that the game\u2019s code had \u201cnot been in a playable state\u201d, and assuring owners that he was going to \u201ckeep on working on the game\u201d until he was happy with it.</p> <p>Dejobaan has officially remained silent since that announcement, but one of its developers <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/app/15540/discussions/0/133255810028120467/\">released new footage</a> of the game in January 2017. Nonetheless, most of Kick It\u2019s customer base is doubtful the game will ever be finished, convinced that it has been abandoned.</p> <p>Games like Kick It also raise questions about the potential for Early Access games to take advantage of their customer base. Should a developer be allowed to continue selling an unfinished game that hasn\u2019t been updated in over five years?

The Steam page for every Early Access game features a boilerplate disclaimer that states: \u201cThis Early Access game is not complete and may or may not change further.\u201d Meanwhile, on its About page for Early Access, Valve implores users not to buy a game unless they are happy to play it in its existing state.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ff8180b037edac771c7428c3cf9cfa2cb656cc38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff8180b037edac771c7428c3cf9cfa2cb656cc38/0_0_1904_1042/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gameplay from Kenshi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"547\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gameplay from Kenshi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such sweeping statements are indicative of Valve\u2019s apparent approach to managing Steam.

      "bodyText": "On 6 December 2018, game developer Chris Hunt\u2019s magnum opus was finally complete. Hunt had been working on Kenshi, in which players navigate a tribe of people through a strange, low-tech alien world, for more than 10 years. You might think finishing it would be a huge milestone in Hunt\u2019s career. But if anything, the opposite is true. \u201cNo one was really bothered by the official release, because nothing will change,\u201d says Hunt, who speaks in a laid-back, laconic fashion that makes him seem affable and yet strangely distant. \u201cPeople kept saying, \u2018Ah, don\u2019t release it too soon.\u2019 I think they were worried that I was going to leave it buggy or incomplete.\u201d This bizarre situation has emerged because, despite being a decade in the making, Kenshi has been playable for half that time, and already has thousands of fans. Kenshi belongs to a sub-group of \u201cEarly Access\u201d games on the biggest online PC games storefront, Steam. Through the platform, developers can release their games in an unfinished state, and use the revenue raised from purchases to fund the remainder of development. It can be likened to crowdfunding, although rather than investing on a promise, purchasers of the games can play along as development progresses. Kenshi was one of 12 games selected to launch the initiative in March 2013. Of those, nine have been finished, two have ceased development, and one is stuck in limbo. Alongside Kenshi, the released games are Kerbal Space Program, ARMA 3, Prison Architect, Drunken Robot Pornography, Gnomoria , Gear Up, Starforge and Kinetic Void. Steam Early Access facilitates projects that would be otherwise impossible to produce. But it raises questions about the relationship between developers and customers, and the responsibilities of Steam\u2019s owner, Valve Corporation, to monitor what\u2019s going on. Although Kenshi was one of the first Early Access games, its story begins much earlier. So long ago, in fact, that Hunt cannot remember exactly when he began working on it. \u201cI\u2019ve been designing games since I was a kid,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d play a bunch, get inspired and start designing on paper. [Kenshi] came from a lifetime of playing games.\u201d Kenshi is a role-playing-game, although it interprets that idea more literally than most. Players don\u2019t become some fantasy hero destined for glory, the familiar Dungeons and Dragons triptych of warrior, mage or rogue. Instead, they can be anything they like within Kenshi\u2019s vast and strange world: a trader, a farmer, a bandit, a thief. It\u2019s a game about forging your own path in a world indifferent to your success or failure. Opportunities are many, but risks are also high, and a character\u2019s story can come to a swift end courtesy of vicious wildlife or roaming groups of bandits. Hunt had put five years into Kenshi before Steam launched its Early Access section, much of that time as a full-time solo developer. He had even started selling prototype copies, using services such as Desura and his own website. When Valve began searching for games to feature, Kenshi was ahead of the pack. \u201cKenshi looks really good on a store-page, because it\u2019s just a huge list of dreamlike features,\u201d says Hunt. \u201cIt had a fanbase, and it was pretty far along in development.\u201d Steam has been vital in supporting Kenshi\u2019s development, being responsible for 95% of all its sales. At the same time, the sheer exposure of being on Steam is also responsible for 95% of Hunt\u2019s stress and worry. \u201cYou have to really be ready to release in Early Access, because people will come down on you like a hammer,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get a wave of people judging you instantly. Every single bug is a panic.\u201d When customers are paying for an unfinished product, expectations are high. Hunt believes one of the reasons Kenshi has maintained its development for so long is through constant communication and regular updates. \u201cIf we did an update every four months, then everyone would get angry and during that gap would be saying, \u2018The game\u2019s abandoned!\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut if we did the same amount of work, but broke it up into an update every day, people felt it was really well maintained.\u2019\u201d But supporting an unfinished game\u2019s development with its sales over several years is not easy. \u201cThere was one point in development where I handed everyone their notices,\u201d Hunt says. \u201cWe were completely running out of money.\u201d Hunt planned to continue working on the game alone, reducing its overall scope. Then sales suddenly picked up, and it was back to business as usual. Not every project has been so fortunate. Another game from the initial batch was Under the Ocean, a subaquatic survival game developed by New Zealand-based artist Paul Hart and programmer Mike Reitzenstein. Boasting a unique art style and a setting that distinguished it from other survival games at the time, Under the Ocean was one of Steam\u2019s most interesting prospects. But the project ran into trouble about a year into development. \u201cWith previous games, Mike and I had a very focused vision, with little outside influence,\u201d says Hart. \u201cBut with Early Access we modified our vision to fit feedback.\u201d One of these modifications was to make each update to the game themed around a specific idea or feature, in the hopes of attracting an influx of new buyers. But the pair found the process disruptive, and in early 2015, Reitzenstein decided to leave the project. This left Hart without a programmer, and thereby without any realistic chance of finishing the game. Not long after, he made the decision to delist Under the Ocean from Steam. \u201cA big part of why I hesitated cancelling the project earlier is the disappointment of letting the player-base down,\u201d Hart says. This is the risk developers take with Early Access. An unfinished project is always disappointing for its creator. But when thousands of other people play a role in funding that project, the disappointment is magnified many times over, and with it comes a burden of neglected responsibility. Hart continued working on the game for the next three years, at weekends, but finally decided to cancel the project a couple of months ago. Throughout, Hart has tried to maintain goodwill with the game\u2019s remaining fanbase, offering free copies of his other games to owners of Under the Ocean \u2013 and, more unusually, promising free copies of games he plans to make in the future. Under the Ocean may have failed, but Hart has done all he can to make the best of an unfortunate situation. The same cannot be said of every Early Access title. Patterns, a game by Second Life developer Linden Labs, unceremoniously ceased development in 2014, sparking much ire. But this is nothing compared to the confounding case of the bizarrely named 1\u20262\u20263\u2026KICK IT! (Drop That Beat like an Ugly Baby). Kick It is a Guitar Hero-style music game developed by Boston-based outfit Dejobaan Games. It launched on Early Access in March 2013 alongside Kenshi, Under the Ocean and Patterns. Nearly six years later, the game remains available to purchase for \u00a36.99 \u2013 but no progress has been made on its development. Dejobaan was contacted several times for comment, asking about the game\u2019s current state and whether there were any plans for further release. There was no response. The last official update occurred in August 2014. Dejobaan\u2019s founder, Ichiro Lambe, apologised for the delays in production, stating that the game\u2019s code had \u201cnot been in a playable state\u201d, and assuring owners that he was going to \u201ckeep on working on the game\u201d until he was happy with it. Dejobaan has officially remained silent since that announcement, but one of its developers released new footage of the game in January 2017. Nonetheless, most of Kick It\u2019s customer base is doubtful the game will ever be finished, convinced that it has been abandoned. Games like Kick It also raise questions about the potential for Early Access games to take advantage of their customer base. Should a developer be allowed to continue selling an unfinished game that hasn\u2019t been updated in over five years? Hunt is disparaging. \u201cI think it\u2019s damaging to everyone in the long term,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the very least, if a game hasn\u2019t been updated enough, they could put a stamp on it that says \u2018Possibly abandoned\u2019\u201d. Valve, for its part, places the onus of responsibility with the customer. The Steam page for every Early Access game features a boilerplate disclaimer that states: \u201cThis Early Access game is not complete and may or may not change further.\u201d Meanwhile, on its About page for Early Access, Valve implores users not to buy a game unless they are happy to play it in its existing state. Such sweeping statements are indicative of Valve\u2019s apparent approach to managing Steam. Valve employs a \u201cdesks-on-wheels\u201d culture that encourages staff to work on whatever project they like. Rather than appoint staff of its own to watch over the storefront, Valve encourages users to leave reviews and create \u201ccurator\u201d lists to highlight their favourites. Earlier this year, after multiple attempts at creating various automated gatekeeping systems, Valve\u2019s Erik Johnson announced the decision to allow any developer to list games on the store with the vague exception of \u201cthings that we decide are illegal, or straight-up trolling\u201d.

The scientists, led by Dr Jonas Lear (Henry Ian Cusick) and Dr Major Nichole Sykes (Caroline Chikezie), have been testing strains on death row inmates, but they need a child brain (it has more neurons, or something) to eliminate the vampire side effects.</p> <p>They dispatch Special Agent Brad Wolgast (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) under supervision of his former friend Clark Richards (Vincent Piazza, voice deeper than any character development on the show) to fetch a child no one will miss: 10-year-old orphan Amy Bellafonte (Saniyya Sidney), the show\u2019s occasional narrator. But as Brad and Amy\u2019s father-daughter bond develops on the road and the captive vampires flex their creepy strength at Project Noah, this plan goes predictably off the rails.</p> <p>The Passage clings to the inherent intrigue of its source material: the spectre of the undead, fascination with apocalyptic scenarios, attractive actors staring at each other, the natural instinct to figure out intentionally withheld information. These foundations have been reinforced in television for decades \u2013 good news for The Passage, because anyone with a passing familiarity of The Walking Dead, The Gifted and about 10 other recent shows will find plenty to snack on here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2dc20afe89ecf4364d1d6478c2b47f50453b2be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2dc20afe89ecf4364d1d6478c2b47f50453b2be/79_0_1969_1967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saniyya Sidney stars as Amy Bellafonte in Fox\u2019s \u2018The Passage.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saniyya Sidney stars as Amy Bellafonte in Fox\u2019s The Passage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ironically for a show purportedly about the thorny and fragile ethics of humanity, the Passage feels as though it\u2019s been written by algorithm \u2013 as if someone plugged names and places into a \u201c12 steps for a screenplay\u201d generator that lifts dialogue from character motivation blurbs. The Passage\u2019s humans speak in either exposition, clunkers (\u201cI feel like I need to move and maybe have another baby\u201d is how Brad\u2019s ex-wife introduces her engagement) or comments pulled from a \u201cdetails to humanize your characters\u201d Tonight Show game. Everyone stares<em> </em>very hard. To say a show strains credulity is to say nothing, but still: The Passage asks you to believe that a beautiful, mid-20s white woman who would never be convicted in the US is nevertheless forgotten on death row. Emotional Baggage is persistently labeled but not carried between scenes; that the vampires want to escape imprisonment and harassment actually feels like the most human and intuitive reaction on the show.</p> <p>The Passage is frustratingly mechanical yet, being human, you can\u2019t help but feel at least slightly invested in this threatened world. It induces eye rolls but still, the virus is easily caught. Set up some world-ending stakes, and there\u2019s drama; put attractive actors next to each other, and there\u2019s some tension, however lukewarm. The Passage, as a show, doesn\u2019t transcend its conceits because it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to; human viewers, knowing what they\u2019re in for, will grease the mechanics for the drama.</p> <p>Which leaves the Passage in a weird border zone \u2013 humans that are dead but undead, characters that are contrived and obvious but still entertaining, a show you might not love in style or substance but might keep watching, anyway.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Passage premieres in the US on Fox on 14 January and in the UK on 15 January<br></p></li> </ul>",

It\u2019s undeniably strong and expansive source material, attracting the attention of Ridley Scott, who optioned it before publication but as a potential feature, it proceeded to languish in limbo before being reconfigured for the small screen, where it now arrives with considerable baggage. Last year, it underwent drastic reshoots and despite the novel\u2019s large following, its TV premiere feels strangely muted. Like the book, it begins in roughly the present day; anticipating a disastrous flu pandemic in the United States, scientists at the secret Project Noah in Colorado pin their hopes on a virus that cures humans of disease, but also turns them into catatonic, blood-sucking monsters intolerant of light. The scientists, led by Dr Jonas Lear (Henry Ian Cusick) and Dr Major Nichole Sykes (Caroline Chikezie), have been testing strains on death row inmates, but they need a child brain (it has more neurons, or something) to eliminate the vampire side effects. They dispatch Special Agent Brad Wolgast (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) under supervision of his former friend Clark Richards (Vincent Piazza, voice deeper than any character development on the show) to fetch a child no one will miss: 10-year-old orphan Amy Bellafonte (Saniyya Sidney), the show\u2019s occasional narrator. But as Brad and Amy\u2019s father-daughter bond develops on the road and the captive vampires flex their creepy strength at Project Noah, this plan goes predictably off the rails. The Passage clings to the inherent intrigue of its source material: the spectre of the undead, fascination with apocalyptic scenarios, attractive actors staring at each other, the natural instinct to figure out intentionally withheld information. These foundations have been reinforced in television for decades \u2013 good news for The Passage, because anyone with a passing familiarity of The Walking Dead, The Gifted and about 10 other recent shows will find plenty to snack on here. Ironically for a show purportedly about the thorny and fragile ethics of humanity, the Passage feels as though it\u2019s been written by algorithm \u2013 as if someone plugged names and places into a \u201c12 steps for a screenplay\u201d generator that lifts dialogue from character motivation blurbs. The Passage\u2019s humans speak in either exposition, clunkers (\u201cI feel like I need to move and maybe have another baby\u201d is how Brad\u2019s ex-wife introduces her engagement) or comments pulled from a \u201cdetails to humanize your characters\u201d Tonight Show game. Everyone stares very hard. To say a show strains credulity is to say nothing, but still: The Passage asks you to believe that a beautiful, mid-20s white woman who would never be convicted in the US is nevertheless forgotten on death row. Emotional Baggage is persistently labeled but not carried between scenes; that the vampires want to escape imprisonment and harassment actually feels like the most human and intuitive reaction on the show. The Passage is frustratingly mechanical yet, being human, you can\u2019t help but feel at least slightly invested in this threatened world. It induces eye rolls but still, the virus is easily caught. Set up some world-ending stakes, and there\u2019s drama; put attractive actors next to each other, and there\u2019s some tension, however lukewarm. The Passage, as a show, doesn\u2019t transcend its conceits because it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to; human viewers, knowing what they\u2019re in for, will grease the mechanics for the drama. Which leaves the Passage in a weird border zone \u2013 humans that are dead but undead, characters that are contrived and obvious but still entertaining, a show you might not love in style or substance but might keep watching, anyway. The Passage premieres in the US on Fox on 14 January and in the UK on 15 January",

Viral sore throats are accompanied by other cold symptoms that may include a runny nose, cough, red or watery eyes, and sneezing.

Smoking also lowers immunity, which can lead to recurrent viral and bacterial infection, and weakens the lower oesophageal sphincter between the stomach and oesophagus (or food pipe), causing acid reflux from the stomach, which can irritate the throat.

      "bodyText": "Rest your body \u2013 and your voice Sore throats are very common and usually get better by themselves within a week. Getting a good night\u2019s sleep always helps to help fight off infection. The NHS advises those with a sore throat to stay well hydrated, although hot drinks should be avoided. Sucking on ice cubes, ice lollies or hard sweets can soothe the inflammation. Ease the discomfort with over-the-counter options If you feel uncomfortable, take paracetamol or ibuprofen. There are also medicated sore-throat lozenges and anaesthetic sprays available over the counter that claim to target pain in the throat with anti-inflammatories. The NHS cautions that \u201cthere\u2019s little proof they help\u201d, but a 2011 study of two different kinds of medicated lozenge found they brought relief and eased soreness and difficulty swallowing within minutes; effects lasted up to two hours post-dose. Make your own gargle Gargling with warm salt water may help to reduce inflammation. (It is not recommended for children.) Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of partly cooled boiled water, gargle with the solution, then spit it out. Repeat as necessary. \u201cIt\u2019s inexpensive and everyone can do it at home \u2013 I recommend this to most patients,\u201d says Abraham Khodadi, a prescribing pharmacist who vlogs weekly about health on YouTube as Abraham the Pharmacist. Don\u2019t assume you need antibiotics Most sore throats are caused by a virus, so they cannot be treated by antibiotics \u2013 even though in many cases they are prescribed anyway. Last year, sore throats accounted for nearly a quarter of inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions in England. Such prescriptions contribute to the global threat of antibiotic resistance. US researchers reported in 2013 that, from 1997 to 2010, about 60% of patients with sore throats received antibiotics, even though only about 10% needed them. Viral sore throats are accompanied by other cold symptoms that may include a runny nose, cough, red or watery eyes, and sneezing. The symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis, \u201cstrep throat\u201d, a bacterial infection, are similar, but likely to be more severe, and possibly accompanied by a high temperature or feeling hot and shivery. Watch for irritants Smoking cigarettes can cause a sore throat by irritating the windpipe. \u201cWhen an irritant is introduced in the system, the body tries to get rid of it by coughing, which can result in more inflammation,\u201d says Khodadi. Smoking also lowers immunity, which can lead to recurrent viral and bacterial infection, and weakens the lower oesophageal sphincter between the stomach and oesophagus (or food pipe), causing acid reflux from the stomach, which can irritate the throat. Other causes of a sore throat include pollution or irritants in the air, allergies, dry air, and changes in temperature, such as going from a warm office to the icy outdoors. Boost your immune system You can safeguard against sore throats by eating a healthy balanced diet, says Khodadi, as well as by having a flu jab. This should alleviate the need for supplements in otherwise healthy people, he says \u2013 although Public Health England has suggested taking a daily vitamin D supplement in winter, which may help to boost immunity. See a healthcare professional The NHS and PHE\u2019s new campaign, Help Us Help You, aims to remind people this winter that pharmacists have the right clinical training to respond to the majority of sore throats. Until the end of winter, more than 200 Superdrug pharmacies in Great Britain are also providing a 10-minute, free sore-throat consultation service, which can include a swab test to determine whether the problem is viral or bacterial. Find your closest participating branch online. If your sore throat persists beyond a week or is recurring, see your GP.",

Washington knows it. Then, Trump and the others will be ready to go for the more muscular approach. Not by accident, this could also benefit Trump as elections approach or if he is cornered by investigations and impeachment. War distracts and makes money. Only this won\u2019t be a regional plunder: China and Russia, both with key interests in Venezuela and elsewhere in the region, have followed Bolivia, Mexico, Uruguay and Cuba to call Guaid\u00f3\u2019s stunt by its real name: a coup. Russia has indicated it would come to the defence of its ally. In Venezuela, many who may be critical of Maduro but fear most the return of the rightwing opposition to power are unlikely to cheer the newly converted humanitarians. Unlike the supporters of Chile\u2019s Salvador Allende in 1973, they\u2019re armed. Washington awaits developments on the ground while keeping \u201call options on the table\u201d. That\u2019s doublespeak for hoping the heavy-handed response by Maduro\u2019s government would provide moral justification for an intervention that would surely be approved by the Organization of American States.</p> \n<p>There is plenty to criticise Maduro for: late or misguided economic measures, corruption, power-hoarding. But these criticisms cannot disguise a coup or justify an intervention that, if and when it comes, would engulf us all. Trump counts on Colombia\u2019s Iv\u00e1n Duque, Alvaro Uribe\u2019s appointee, and Brazil\u2019s neo-fascists to support this, contributing troops of their own if needed. A neo-fascist runs one of the Americas\u2019 powerhouses in Brazil; a narcissistic liar afraid of being painted into a corner runs the other. That combination is toxic. War in the name of humanity may tempt them, as it did the more liberal leaders of the past. But this time the stakes are higher. Venezuela\u2019s coup is a threat to the entire world.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Oscar Guardiola-Rivera teaches human rights and philosophy at Birkbeck College, University of London</p>",

Trump swiftly recognised Guaid\u00f3 as the interim president of Venezuela, and was followed by a cohort of Latin American presidents, all-white, upper-class leaders now spearheading the new reactionary wave in the region: Brazil\u2019s Jair Bolsonaro, Argentina\u2019s Mauricio Macri, Colombia\u2019s Iv\u00e1n Duque and Chile\u2019s Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era. They\u2019ll proclaim themselves saviours of democracy and humanitarianism, the liars. Draping themselves in the robes of the liberators of yesteryear, just as Guaid\u00f3 draped himself in the image of Chavez and Bol\u00edvar while holding a constitution with the latter\u2019s image on its cover, they\u2019ll happily support further US sanctions, paramilitary forces training Venezuela\u2019s opposition in the torture tactics that displaced 7 million people in Colombia, or using \u201clawfare\u201d in pan-American institutions just as happened to Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff in Brazil, Manuel Zelaya in Honduras and Fernando Lugo in Paraguay. Expect such measures to have limited purchase. Washington knows it. Then, Trump and the others will be ready to go for the more muscular approach. Not by accident, this could also benefit Trump as elections approach or if he is cornered by investigations and impeachment. War distracts and makes money. Only this won\u2019t be a regional plunder: China and Russia, both with key interests in Venezuela and elsewhere in the region, have followed Bolivia, Mexico, Uruguay and Cuba to call Guaid\u00f3\u2019s stunt by its real name: a coup. Russia has indicated it would come to the defence of its ally. In Venezuela, many who may be critical of Maduro but fear most the return of the rightwing opposition to power are unlikely to cheer the newly converted humanitarians. Unlike the supporters of Chile\u2019s Salvador Allende in 1973, they\u2019re armed. Washington awaits developments on the ground while keeping \u201call options on the table\u201d. That\u2019s doublespeak for hoping the heavy-handed response by Maduro\u2019s government would provide moral justification for an intervention that would surely be approved by the Organization of American States. There is plenty to criticise Maduro for: late or misguided economic measures, corruption, power-hoarding. But these criticisms cannot disguise a coup or justify an intervention that, if and when it comes, would engulf us all. Trump counts on Colombia\u2019s Iv\u00e1n Duque, Alvaro Uribe\u2019s appointee, and Brazil\u2019s neo-fascists to support this, contributing troops of their own if needed. A neo-fascist runs one of the Americas\u2019 powerhouses in Brazil; a narcissistic liar afraid of being painted into a corner runs the other. That combination is toxic. War in the name of humanity may tempt them, as it did the more liberal leaders of the past. But this time the stakes are higher. Venezuela\u2019s coup is a threat to the entire world. \u2022 Oscar Guardiola-Rivera teaches human rights and philosophy at Birkbeck College, University of London",

      "body": "<p>Oh my goodness, what have they done to The Cherry Orchard? The grand ball has become a beach party. Madame Ranevskaya has a noose around her neck. The entire ensemble are receiving blood transfusions. And Lopakhin has become a sex maniac who begins the play in bed with the maid. There isn\u2019t a samovar in sight \u2013 or even a cherry orchard, for that matter.</p> <p>This is the Pushkin Drama Theatre\u2019s production, which is on its way to Britain. I caught it in Moscow just before Christmas \u2013 and was somewhat taken aback. It is Chekhov as absurdist drama, played on a raked stage with minimal props. In this portrait of a dysfunctional family and a neurotic society, Lopakhin is a youthful oligarch in love with money \u2013 and with the glamorous Madame Ranevskaya. Both are much younger than we are used to seeing them in the UK, but the two leads \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1835909/\">Viktoriya Isakova</a> and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5003252/\">Alexander Petrov</a> \u2013 insist this is faithful to Chekhov.</p> <p>I meet them just before curtain-up and ask if they are playing The Cherry Orchard as tragedy or comedy, such ambiguity being the defining characteristic of Chekhov. \u201cTragedy,\u201d says Isakova emphatically. \u201cComedy,\u201d says Petrov with a laugh. \u201cThe comedy and the tragedy are always there,\u201d adds Isakova. \u201cI see this in my own life. But Ranevskaya is a tragic figure.\u201d</p> <p>The director is <a href=\"https://www.mariinsky.ru/en/company/common_opera/mirzoev\">Vladimir Mirzoev</a>, a gnarled, bearded veteran who emigrated to Canada in 1989 but has continued to work extensively in Russia. He thinks the comedy v tragedy question is irrelevant. \u201cYou can\u2019t pick one genre to define a whole life,\u201d he says. \u201cIt contains elements of comedy, tragedy and farce.\u201d He also rejects any suggestion that his take on Chekhov is radical. \u201cFor the more radically attuned part of the audience, this production may not be radical enough. But for the conservative part, it may be quite irritating. So we end up causing irritation to both sides.\u201d</p> <p>Mirzoev, who has never directed The Cherry Orchard before, wanted to make it relevant to the \u201cproblems, situations and fears\u201d of people today. He says the \u201cinevitable catastrophe\u201d society faces, the \u201cfeeling that everyone is on the edge of a precipice\u201d, will connect with the audience, even the well-heeled one in Moscow, where international sanctions are biting, inflation is rising and the nationalistic certainties of the Putin era are not as settled as they seem. So yes, it is a comedy, but one that Mirzoev calls a \u201ccomedy of catastrophes\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64060a6e2a05eafc45fb0c089c2dae9f3c779d67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64060a6e2a05eafc45fb0c089c2dae9f3c779d67/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The comedy and tragedy are always there\u2019 \u2026 Viktoriya Isakova in The Cherry Orchard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The comedy and tragedy are always there\u2019 \u2026 Viktoriya Isakova in The Cherry Orchard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Yocu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The dilemma of how to play The Cherry Orchard, Chekhov\u2019s final play, has been there from the beginning. Konstantin Stanislavski, the founder of modern Russian theatre, directed the premiere in 1904. He was firmly in the tragedy camp, whereas Chekhov insisted on calling it a comedy. They had had similar battles over Three Sisters in 1901, when Chekhov complained that Stanislavski\u2019s \u201cexuberance\u201d was undermining his intentions.</p> <p>Chekhov is the dramatist of the throwaway.

In Uncle Vanya, the title character tries to shoot the parasitical Serebryakov, but inevitably misses \u2013 and life goes on. Stanislavski would have played up the drama of the attempt, while Chekhov would have enjoyed its futility.</p> <p>In a sense, Chekhov is temperamentally more English than Russian \u2013 or at least more obviously suited to audiences in the UK where, with the possible exception of Brexit, muddling through is a way of life. \u201cDespite all the interesting innovations and themes in Russian avant-garde theatre today, they are still stuck in social issues,\u201d says the <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/people/experts/katya-rogatchevskaia\">Russian-born Katya Rogatchevskaia</a>, curator of east European collections at the British Library. \u201cThey are not dealing with existential questions in the way British theatre does.\u201d</p> <p>She recently saw a London production of Harold Pinter\u2019s The Room and thinks a Russian company would struggle with it. \u201cYou cannot interpret it,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to understand that you don\u2019t understand it.\u201d But in Russia, she says, theatre and audience want resolution.

The irony of the 1917 revolution, Professor Curtis points out, was that the leading revolutionaries were deeply conservative, at least artistically. Bizarrely, their models were the 19th-century tsars, who loathed innovative, free-thinking writers such as Mikhail Lermontov (Nicholas I called his A Hero of Our Time \u201codious and debauched\u201d). In the 1920s, directors sought to introduce a radical new artistic dawn which they believed to be in keeping with the ideals of the revolution, only to be attacked in the following decade for \u201cbourgeois formalism\u201d. Several of the leading experimentalists, notably Vsevolod Meyerhold, met brutal ends in Stalin\u2019s purges.</p> <p>So, at the height of Stalinism, theatre settled into a socialist-realist rut. The Cherry Orchard was played \u2013 at a time when Chekhov\u2019s other plays were largely neglected \u2013 as a political fable describing the downfall of an effete landed class. The nouveau riche Lopakhin (who wants to save Madame Ranevskaya from bankruptcy by turning her cherry orchard into holiday homes) and Trofimov (an unworldly, radical student) were seen as heralds of the new revolutionary age.</p> <p>Then, in the 1960s, in the post-Stalin thaw, bourgeois formalism came back into vogue. Chekhov was revisited in a host of innovative new productions that mined the plays for metaphorical meaning. Suddenly Russian theatre was boundlessly exciting \u2013 and energised by friction with the authorities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d2417d2ef98de51eabc22d2077b0c43ba2ebe94b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2417d2ef98de51eabc22d2077b0c43ba2ebe94b/0_294_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexander Arsentiev and Anastasia Lebedeva in Pushkin Drama Theatre\u2019s The Good Person of Szechwan, also at the Barbican.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexander Arsentiev and Anastasia Lebedeva in Pushkin Drama Theatre\u2019s The Good Person of Szechwan, also at the Barbican.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Yocu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Has that revisionism now run its course? Perhaps the socialist realists had a point: aesthetic experimentation on its own \u2013 noisy, exuberant art for art\u2019s sake \u2013 is of limited value. The British approach to Chekhov can sometimes be unduly literal, genteel and cloying, but it is possible to err in the opposite direction: overinterpreting, striving for effect at the expense of the text, privileging metaphor over the notion that the author is portraying something approximating to real life.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of Russian directors of Chekhov seek to make a statement or present a view of the world,\u201d says Sergei Ostrovsky, co-chair of the London-based Russian cultural centre Pushkin House and a one-time theatre critic turned corporate lawyer. \u201cVery few productions actually want to read the play.\u201d In part, he says, it is because the texts are so well known that directors feel obliged to turn them upside down, but he finds such self-consciousness off-putting. \u201cIt\u2019s a very easy way out. You have a wonderful box of tricks and you just pull these things out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"af2a6466d7751365cf989004821514ff2af76e05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af2a6466d7751365cf989004821514ff2af76e05/0_82_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chelsea owner turned theatre impresario Roman Abramovich.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chelsea owner turned theatre impresario Roman Abramovich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mainstream Russian theatre, with its emphasis on directorial ego and gorgeous picture-making on stage, strikes me as similar to <em>regietheater</em> (the German term for \u201cdirector\u2019s theatre\u201d) in opera, where making a splash by rethinking, perhaps even subverting, the author\u2019s intentions is central. It could be that Russian audiences know their Chekhov so well they have to be confronted with it in this way. But it may also be true that, faced with an endless diet of \u201cradical\u201d reinterpretation, true radicalism would consist in returning to the text and concentrating on the interplay of the characters.</p> <p>The Pushkin troupe is bringing two other works to London\u2019s Barbican: Brecht\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2019/event/moscow-pushkin-drama-theatre-the-good-person-of-szechwan\">The Good Person of Szechwan</a>; and a piece of physical theatre called <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2019/event/moscow-pushkin-drama-theatre-mothers-field\">Mother\u2019s Field</a>, adapted from a novella by Soviet-era Kyrgyz writer Chinghiz Aitmatov. Good Person has become the Pushkin\u2019s signature show. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/roman-abramovich\">billionaire businessman Roman Abramovich</a> watched a performance in Moscow, loved it, and has been instrumental in bringing it to London. His deep pockets are crucial \u2013 housing a 100-strong Russian company at the Barbican for a week does not come cheap.</p> <p>Good Person, which I also saw in Moscow, is better suited to the Pushkin\u2019s high-energy ensemble style. Brecht poses a social and moral problem \u2013 how to lead a good life in a corrupt society \u2013 with which the company can engage. Chekhov evades such didacticism: everything may be collapsing, but shouldn\u2019t we just sit down and have a cup of tea? Provided someone has remembered the samovar, of course.</p> <p>\u2022 The <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2019/series/moscow-pushkin-drama-theatre\">Pushkin Drama Theatre\u2019s season</a> at the Barbican, London, runs 5-9 February.</p>",

The British approach to Chekhov can sometimes be unduly literal, genteel and cloying, but it is possible to err in the opposite direction: overinterpreting, striving for effect at the expense of the text, privileging metaphor over the notion that the author is portraying something approximating to real life. \u201cA lot of Russian directors of Chekhov seek to make a statement or present a view of the world,\u201d says Sergei Ostrovsky, co-chair of the London-based Russian cultural centre Pushkin House and a one-time theatre critic turned corporate lawyer. \u201cVery few productions actually want to read the play.\u201d In part, he says, it is because the texts are so well known that directors feel obliged to turn them upside down, but he finds such self-consciousness off-putting. \u201cIt\u2019s a very easy way out. You have a wonderful box of tricks and you just pull these things out.\u201d Mainstream Russian theatre, with its emphasis on directorial ego and gorgeous picture-making on stage, strikes me as similar to regietheater (the German term for \u201cdirector\u2019s theatre\u201d) in opera, where making a splash by rethinking, perhaps even subverting, the author\u2019s intentions is central. It could be that Russian audiences know their Chekhov so well they have to be confronted with it in this way. But it may also be true that, faced with an endless diet of \u201cradical\u201d reinterpretation, true radicalism would consist in returning to the text and concentrating on the interplay of the characters. The Pushkin troupe is bringing two other works to London\u2019s Barbican: Brecht\u2019s The Good Person of Szechwan; and a piece of physical theatre called Mother\u2019s Field, adapted from a novella by Soviet-era Kyrgyz writer Chinghiz Aitmatov. Good Person has become the Pushkin\u2019s signature show. The billionaire businessman Roman Abramovich watched a performance in Moscow, loved it, and has been instrumental in bringing it to London. His deep pockets are crucial \u2013 housing a 100-strong Russian company at the Barbican for a week does not come cheap. Good Person, which I also saw in Moscow, is better suited to the Pushkin\u2019s high-energy ensemble style. Brecht poses a social and moral problem \u2013 how to lead a good life in a corrupt society \u2013 with which the company can engage. Chekhov evades such didacticism: everything may be collapsing, but shouldn\u2019t we just sit down and have a cup of tea? Provided someone has remembered the samovar, of course. \u2022 The Pushkin Drama Theatre\u2019s season at the Barbican, London, runs 5-9 February.",

HMRC recently raised its estimate for the amount a 1 percentage point increase in corporation tax could bring in for the Treasury from \u00a32.8bn to \u00a33.1bn per year \u2013 meaning the plan to cut taxes by 2p in the \u00a31 could cost about \u00a36.2bn.

Hammond confirmed in the autumn that he would go ahead with Osborne\u2019s promises, despite the need to find \u00a320bn a year more for the NHS by 2023-24. There has been mounting opposition to the planned tax cuts, particularly as Britain\u2019s public finances could come under huge strain from a disorderly Brexit. Rupert Harrison, a former adviser to Osborne who now works at City investment firm BlackRock, said last week on Twitter that it was \u201chard to see why further cuts to corporation tax are good value,\u201d while Labour seized on his comments. Peter Dowd, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cEven Osborne\u2019s former adviser knows that further cuts to corporation tax are a bad use of public funds. Philip Hammond should cancel his plans for more corporate giveaways and invest in our public services.\u201d Labour has argued that it would reverse the cuts to raise more money for spending on public services. But a Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cThe strength of our economy means we are expecting to collect more corporation tax in 2020 than forecast one year ago. \u201cLow corporation tax supports the economy by enabling companies to reinvest in their business, create jobs, and increase wages.\u201d Corporation tax receipts have increased since the financial crisis, although profits of firms have risen as the economy has recovered.

      "body": "<p>My wife and others have recently fallen victim to an eBay scam. In December she sold my iPhone 7 Plus for \u00a3345. The buyer paid via PayPal and requested the item be delivered to their local Argos, as eBay facilitates that. A week later, the buyer said he wanted to return the phone as he couldn\u2019t activate it. We knew this couldn\u2019t be the case, but felt we had no choice but to start the return and refund process.</p> <p>On New Year\u2019s Eve we got a notification that the phone had been returned, but there was no sign of it.</p> <p>That\u2019s when we found some blog/forum posts about a scam where a fake buyer requests a refund, then returns an empty package to a different address by adulterating the return label, crucially to an address that\u2019s in the same postal area as the seller.</p> <p>As eBay sees that the package has been delivered to the postal area, it assumes it was received and issues a refund. The problem is, Royal Mail\u2019s tracking does not include the full address, just the postal town. We believe this loophole is being exploited by scammers.</p> <p>Royal Mail cannot divulge to us exactly where the empty package was delivered, citing confidentiality. I find it unbelievable that a company as big as eBay can\u2019t put changes in place to stop these practices.</p> <p>We opened a dispute, but it was immediately shut down stating we had \u201creceived the item\u201d. We have no money and no iPhone.</p> <p>NB, <em>Middlesbrough</em></p> <p>eBay has not disputed your claims, suggesting that it is as you say \u2013 scammers are exploiting this problem.

      "bodyText": "My wife and others have recently fallen victim to an eBay scam. In December she sold my iPhone 7 Plus for \u00a3345. The buyer paid via PayPal and requested the item be delivered to their local Argos, as eBay facilitates that. A week later, the buyer said he wanted to return the phone as he couldn\u2019t activate it. We knew this couldn\u2019t be the case, but felt we had no choice but to start the return and refund process. On New Year\u2019s Eve we got a notification that the phone had been returned, but there was no sign of it. That\u2019s when we found some blog/forum posts about a scam where a fake buyer requests a refund, then returns an empty package to a different address by adulterating the return label, crucially to an address that\u2019s in the same postal area as the seller. As eBay sees that the package has been delivered to the postal area, it assumes it was received and issues a refund. The problem is, Royal Mail\u2019s tracking does not include the full address, just the postal town. We believe this loophole is being exploited by scammers. Royal Mail cannot divulge to us exactly where the empty package was delivered, citing confidentiality. I find it unbelievable that a company as big as eBay can\u2019t put changes in place to stop these practices. We opened a dispute, but it was immediately shut down stating we had \u201creceived the item\u201d. We have no money and no iPhone. NB, Middlesbrough eBay has not disputed your claims, suggesting that it is as you say \u2013 scammers are exploiting this problem. Since we took up your case we have been contacted by several other victims. As we have previously reported, and our colleague Anna Tims highlighted recently in the Observer, eBay invariably sides with the buyer, something scammers are exploiting.

If you sell your current home and buy another one to live in with your partner/spouse, the standard \u2013 rather than higher \u2013 rate of stamp duty will apply because you would be selling a main residence and replacing it with another. However, if your partner already owns property and doesn\u2019t plan to sell it to buy with you, the higher rates will apply whether you are married or not. But if they were to sell their old home within three years of buying another with you, you would be able to get a rebate of the extra 3% added to the standard stamp duty rate.",

Stuart Murphy, the former TV executive who joined English National Opera as its chief executive last spring, made the damning assessment as he announced new measures to tackle its lack of diversity. That includes positive action to recruit at least four chorus members from a black, Asian and ethnic minority (BAME) background. Murphy recalled joining the company and and finding it \u201creally shocking\u201d that 39 of ENO\u2019s 40-strong chorus were white. \u201cWe weren\u2019t true to our values, we didn\u2019t represent Britain,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just felt strange to me \u2026 Young white audiences also think it is weird.\u201d He pointed to figures showing that of the 170 permanent chorus singers in the UK, less than five were from a BAME background.

Many observers have complained, however, of there being lots of talking, and less doing. Arts Council England\u2019s annual diversity report last year, for example, identified \u201ca large gap between organisational aspiration and action\u201d. Murphy said opera had a particular problem. \u201cThere has been something about classical music and opera that tends to hire its own, whether its class, whether its gender, or ethnicity. That just felt strange. \u201cThere is something about opera any way that feels quite a bit behind other media.

Four new members of the chorus from a BAME background will be hired for the 19/20 season with a view to extend for a further season. It would also seek to employ singers from a BAME background for extra chorus positions. He also announced three annual and paid ENO \u201cdirector observerships\u201d offering emerging BAME directors the chance to work alongside \u201cworld-renowned opera directors\u201d. The measures add to a change made by ENO last year in its orchestra recruitment when it introduced blind auditions for musicians. The company is also trying to diversify its audience and announced before Christmas free balcony tickets on Saturday nights for under-18s. \u201cIt has been a huge hit and I think the atmosphere will change a lot,\u201d said Murphy.

He said in the current season 13% of singers are BAME, a figure that does not include last year\u2019s Porgy and Bess, a show Gershwin insisted should always have a black cast. \u201cIt is really hard to re-correct stuff quickly because in opera talent is booked several years ahead.,\u201d said Murphy. Murphy joined ENO last April after a career in television that included being the launch director of BBC Three and the director of Sky\u2019s entertainment channels.",

Gender comes into the politics of weapons, for those who aspire to own them and those who use them to kill,\u201d Diniz <a href=\"https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/01/16/opinion/1547636987_572077.html\">wrote in El Pais</a>, arguing that weapons policy must be sensitive to a country\u2019s gender norms. \u201cFemicide is a word invented in Latin America. We are the region of the world where more women die at the hands of their husbands, boyfriends, fathers and sons.</p> <p>\u201cIf today there are cases where women survive attempted femicide, it is in large part because the instrument of violence was physical force or other instruments that are less lethal, like knives or ropes. In cases where guns are used, the chances of a woman surviving are much rarer.\u201d</p> <p>The gun policy debate goes to the heart of divisions in Brazil as the country adapts to a new president. While many revile Bolsonaro for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/06/homophobic-mismogynist-racist-brazil-jair-bolsonaro\">expressions of misogyny and homophobia</a>, his toughness on crime resonates with women panicked by what has become a violent crime epidemic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d7247b8b739849129a80cd033d9ad435046a393b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7247b8b739849129a80cd033d9ad435046a393b/0_0_820_1232/666.jpg\" alt=\"Leticia Aguiar\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">S\u00e3o Paulo state deputy Leticia Aguiar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Leticia Aguiar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pictured draped in a Brazilian flag, a revolver protruding from her jeans, S\u00e3o Paulo state deputy Leticia Aguiar is among high-profile supporters. She argues that women have been \u201cthe main victims\u201d of a previous policy of civilian disarmament.</p> <p>\u201cAn unprotected woman is an easy target for rape. A woman who is armed is prepared for daily life and, in my view, can even be considered more of a citizen in favour of social order,\u201d says Aguiar, the self-described \u201cadoptive daughter\u201d of Bolsonaro.</p> <p>That view is not echoed by the public defenders who have issued statements warning the decree will increase the risk of femicide. The public defender of S\u00e3o Paulo has formulated a protective measure that suspends the possession of weapons by anyone with a history of domestic and family violence, in accordance with the Maria da Penha law.</p> <p>Some point out that laws making it easier to own a gun wouldn\u2019t help poorer women to protect themselves, since they couldn\u2019t afford to buy one anyway.</p> <p>In communities where violence is already rife, the idea of introducing more weapons is widely seen as sheer madness. Women in such areas are disproportionately affected by gun violence, not just from drug trafficking gangs but also from military police during operations.</p> <p>\u201cMaking it easier to get guns is really bad, because we are already living in a civil war,\u201d says *Jenifer Rodriguez, who lives in a favela in Duque de Caxias near Rio de Janeiro. \u201cThis week I was awoken with a gun to my head because the police came into the favela and they had a key to open all our doors. It was terrible, they kept me there answering questions for two hours and confiscated my phone. These days I say that when I leave the house I don\u2019t know if I am going to return home alive.\u201d</p> <p>Education is the weapon to protect women from violence, not guns, says Da Penha. \u201cOnly education from an early age can dismantle the culture of machismo and homophobia.

Since the decree, domestic violence survivors have been using the hashtag #SeEleEstivesseArmado (\u201cIf he had been armed\u201d) to express the belief that, had their attacker had access to a gun, they would be dead. \u201cMy ex found it normal to pursue me 200km into a different state, invade my house, harass and threaten me,\u201d says one. \u201cThat day, every time he reached in his rucksack, I thought he was going to grab a gun. If he had been armed, I would be dead.\u201d Another tweet reads: \u201cFor many of us who experienced an abusive relationship, that question that lingers in the mind is: what if he had come back with a weapon?\u201d \u201cWe live in a society colonised by fear,\u201d says Debora Diniz, professor of anthropology at the University of Brasilia, explaining the appeal of Bolsonaro\u2019s stance on gun ownership to women who voted for him in November and others who back the decree. \u201cWe are afraid of walking the streets and are looking for easy solutions.\u201d Diniz warned that, imported into a macho society like Brazil, a US-style political understanding that an individual has a right to protect their private property is problematic for women, who might be regarded as part of that property. \u201cA gun is an object of desire for men. Gender comes into the politics of weapons, for those who aspire to own them and those who use them to kill,\u201d Diniz wrote in El Pais, arguing that weapons policy must be sensitive to a country\u2019s gender norms. \u201cFemicide is a word invented in Latin America. We are the region of the world where more women die at the hands of their husbands, boyfriends, fathers and sons. \u201cIf today there are cases where women survive attempted femicide, it is in large part because the instrument of violence was physical force or other instruments that are less lethal, like knives or ropes. In cases where guns are used, the chances of a woman surviving are much rarer.\u201d The gun policy debate goes to the heart of divisions in Brazil as the country adapts to a new president. While many revile Bolsonaro for his expressions of misogyny and homophobia, his toughness on crime resonates with women panicked by what has become a violent crime epidemic. Pictured draped in a Brazilian flag, a revolver protruding from her jeans, S\u00e3o Paulo state deputy Leticia Aguiar is among high-profile supporters. She argues that women have been \u201cthe main victims\u201d of a previous policy of civilian disarmament. \u201cAn unprotected woman is an easy target for rape. A woman who is armed is prepared for daily life and, in my view, can even be considered more of a citizen in favour of social order,\u201d says Aguiar, the self-described \u201cadoptive daughter\u201d of Bolsonaro. That view is not echoed by the public defenders who have issued statements warning the decree will increase the risk of femicide. The public defender of S\u00e3o Paulo has formulated a protective measure that suspends the possession of weapons by anyone with a history of domestic and family violence, in accordance with the Maria da Penha law. Some point out that laws making it easier to own a gun wouldn\u2019t help poorer women to protect themselves, since they couldn\u2019t afford to buy one anyway. In communities where violence is already rife, the idea of introducing more weapons is widely seen as sheer madness. Women in such areas are disproportionately affected by gun violence, not just from drug trafficking gangs but also from military police during operations. \u201cMaking it easier to get guns is really bad, because we are already living in a civil war,\u201d says *Jenifer Rodriguez, who lives in a favela in Duque de Caxias near Rio de Janeiro. \u201cThis week I was awoken with a gun to my head because the police came into the favela and they had a key to open all our doors. It was terrible, they kept me there answering questions for two hours and confiscated my phone. These days I say that when I leave the house I don\u2019t know if I am going to return home alive.\u201d Education is the weapon to protect women from violence, not guns, says Da Penha. \u201cOnly education from an early age can dismantle the culture of machismo and homophobia. We need to mobilise women against this mindset.\u201d *Name changed to protect identity",

Pinto first saw the script a decade ago. But in hindsight, she says, she wasn\u2019t ready for Love Sonia. She was too unworldly. \u201cI thought it was exaggerated when I read the script. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was reading.\u201d Later, when she met trafficked sex workers advising on the film, she began to think that, if anything, the story had been understated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1b32a4a33bb2ce072f279d870eba2430588246c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1b32a4a33bb2ce072f279d870eba2430588246c/0_34_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frieda Pinto\u2019s new film Love Sonia portrays the dark underbelly of sex trafficking in India.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frieda Pinto\u2019s new film Love Sonia portrays the dark underbelly of sex trafficking in India.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/BIG STUFF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Off-screen, Pinto has been a force for good, consistently campaigning for the rights of women.

There was no way I agreed with so much that I did in my early career.\u201d As for now, Pinto could not be happier that nobody is likely to come out of Love Sonia discussing her looks. On its release in India, the film was not been warmly received. \u201cPeople haven\u2019t welcomed a film that exposes the underbelly of the country.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Councils face soaring demand for social care Good morning \u2013 this is Alison Rourke bringing you the first briefing for the week. There\u2019s more evidence this morning of the biting austerity being felt by some communities with a report by the Centre for Cities thinktank saying local authority spending has fallen nationally by half since 2010. Areas such as Liverpool, Blackburn and Barnsley are facing average cuts twice that of their counterparts in the more affluent south. \u201cCouncils have managed as best they can but the continued singling out of local government for cuts cannot continue,\u201d says the group\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Carter. \u201cFairer funding must mean more funding for cities.\u201d The five cities and towns that have suffered the biggest falls in spending over the past eight years are all in the north of England: Barnsley (-40%), Liverpool (-32%), Doncaster (-31%), Wakefield (-30%) and Blackburn (-27%). The British average is -14.3%. In Barnsley, 62% of the entire council budget went on social care in 2017-18, reflecting the \u201cdesperation and despair\u201d of its residents. The Guardian\u2019s social policy editor, Patrick Butler, has talked to residents facing crippling cuts about how they are coping ... and fighting back. * * * Backstop impasse? \u2013 As Theresa May faces her crucial vote on Brexit tomorrow, Ireland\u2019s last-minute effort to warn the PM off any attempt to unravel the backstop deal will be raising the temperature in Downing Street. Yesterday, the Irish foreign minster and deputy PM insisted the backstop \u2013 the mechanism to ensure there will be no hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland if Britain and the EU fail to strike a free-trade deal \u2013 was \u201cpart of a balanced package that isn\u2019t going to change\u201d. He said it was only part of the withdrawal agreement because of the UK\u2019s red lines. As the Brexit wars continue, the UK has become \u201cmeaner and angrier\u201d since the 2016 vote, according to the Edelman Trust Barometer, a long-established, annual survey of trust carried out across the globe. It says there is widespread unhappiness about the direction the country is heading with 40% thinking others are now more likely to take part in violent protests. One person in six says they have fallen out with friends or relatives over Brexit and 65% think the country is \u201con the wrong track\u201d, the survey found. * * * \u2018Significant response\u2019 \u2013 The US has warned that it will act if there is any violence against its diplomats in Venezuela. The White House national security adviser John Bolton warned on Twitter that \u201cany violence and intimidation against US diplomatic personnel, Venezuela\u2019s democratic leader, Juan Guiado (sic), or the National Assembly itself would represent a grave assault on the rule of law and will be met with a significant response\u201d. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, Guaid\u00f3 said his country had a chance to leave chaos behind and claimed his economically devastated nation was living through an \u201calmost magical moment\u201d in its newly revived quest for democracy. \u201cFrustration has turned to hope. People are daring to dream again,\u201d he said ahead of further rallies planned this week to step up pressure for a change of leadership. * * * All rise \u2013 Half of magistrates courts in England and Wales have closed since 2010, leaving defendants, witnesses, police, lawyers and JPs having to travel huge distances to court. Since the coalition government came to power in 2010, 162 of the 323 magistrates courts in England and Wales have shut \u2013 a loss of 50.2% of the estate. Most have been sold. The controversial Ministry of Justice (MOJ) efficiency exercise is directly tied to the need to generate funds for a \u00a31.2bn digital modernisation programme, which came under the spotlight following a meltdown of court computer systems. * * * Lending boom \u2013 Britain\u2019s biggest lender is to offer 100% mortgages to first-time buyers in a return to lending last seen before the financial crash \u2013 but only if the buyer has family that can stand behind the loan. Under the new Lloyds Bank \u201cLend A Hand\u201d deal, a first-time buyer will be able to borrow up to \u00a3500,000 for a new home, without putting down a penny of deposit. It marks a major expansion into the first-time buyer market, as most other mainstream lenders demand a minimum deposit worth 5% of the property purchase price, although Barclays has offered a similar \u201cfamily springboard\u201d deal. Lloyds has priced the mortgages to undercut the Barclays offer. * * * Bear necessities \u2013 A little boy lost in the freezing woods of North Carolina says a bear helped him survive two nights alone before rescuers found him. The Craven county sheriff, Chip Hughes, said three-year-old Casey Hathaway, \u201cdid say that he had a friend in the woods that was a bear that was with him\u201d. The claim was reportedly repeated by the boy\u2019s aunt Breanna Hathaway. \u201cHe said he hung out with a bear for two days,\u201d Hathaway wrote in a Facebook post. Whether the grizzly was real or imagined, rescuers have hailed the boy\u2019s tenacity given he was not dressed for the cold and temperatures dipped below freezing. Today in Focus podcast: Going viral: the victims of online conspiracy theories What is it like to be the focus of an online conspiracy theory that goes viral? Four people whose lives were upended by conspiracists tell the Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington how they dealt with it \u2013 and why it could happen to anyone. Plus: Jamie Fullerton on the monkey gangs of Kuala Lumpur whose jungle habitat is being swallowed by the city. Lunchtime read: Freida Pinto\u2019s complex, edgy new role Freida Pinto\u2019s rise to fame in Slumdog Millionaire was followed by a string of films that essentially relied on her looks. And she\u2019s sick of it. As Simon Hattenstone writes, the Indian-born star\u2019s newest film, Love Sonia, about a desperate sex worker in a brutal tale of trafficking is everything viewers have come not to expect: a complex, edgy and selfish character caught in a brutal world. Pinto first saw the script a decade ago. But in hindsight, she says, she wasn\u2019t ready for Love Sonia. She was too unworldly. \u201cI thought it was exaggerated when I read the script. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was reading.\u201d Later, when she met trafficked sex workers advising on the film, she began to think that, if anything, the story had been understated. Off-screen, Pinto has been a force for good, consistently campaigning for the rights of women. Does she see a contradiction between her feminism and the films she has made? \u201cCompletely! There was no way I agreed with so much that I did in my early career.\u201d As for now, Pinto could not be happier that nobody is likely to come out of Love Sonia discussing her looks. On its release in India, the film was not been warmly received. \u201cPeople haven\u2019t welcomed a film that exposes the underbelly of the country. It hasn\u2019t done well.\u201d But she says she is not going to judge the film\u2019s success by its box office takings \u2013 highlighting the trafficking scandal is far more important. Sport Mauricio Pochettino has defended his record at Tottenham and argued claiming silverware would serve only to \u201cbuild egos\u201d rather than maintain progress after seeing his team knocked out of a second domestic cup competition in four days. Novak Djokovic is the best men\u2019s tennis player in the world: now, and for the foreseeable future, perhaps until he chooses to retire, which looks to be a few years away yet, he hinted after the Australian Open final. At the age of 21, Naomi Osaka has two grand slam titles and, when she wakes up on Monday morning, she will also find No 1 next to her name on the world ranking list. A return to the England side for Stuart Broad is on the cards with selectors having to respond not only to a batting collapse but also to a bowling attack that became ever more toothless and untrustworthy as the first Test against West Indies progressed. And the Premier League\u2019s renewed hunt for a new chief executive is continuing to focus on the broadcasting industry, despite knockbacks from two leading TV figures, with several other top executives of major TV companies under consideration. Business In this crucial Brexit week, the Confederation of British Industry has warned businesses are \u201cpraying for an extension of article 50\u201d rather than no-deal. In a gloomy assessment, it also says companies\u2019 reported growth prospects were at their weakest for almost six years. Asian shares gained overnight on optimism over the Trump administration\u2019s temporary deal on ending the US government shutdown. However, the FTSE100 looks like dropping 0.3% according to futures trading, while the pound is at $1.32 and \u20ac1.155 as it looks to build on its recent strong gains. The papers With the next vital Brexit vote coming up tomorrow, it\u2019s not surprising that many of the papers splash on the story. \u201cTrapped in the EU for ever\u201d is the Daily Express headline. The Telegraph quotes Boris Johnson in its headline: \u201cBoris: May is fighting to scrap backstop\u201d. The Times has \u201cLoyalists threaten to desert May in push for soft Brexit\u201d and the i has: \u201cGone in 60 days?\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s headline is \u201cNo new deal on backstop, says Ireland\u201d but it reserves its splash for \u201cHalf of all magistrate courts axed since 2010\u201d. The FT\u2019s Brexit story is: \u201cBrexit puts brake on London housing market as sales fall back to 2008 lows\u201d but its main headline is: \u201cBeijing\u2019s EU envoy rails at \u2018slander\u2019 against Huawei over security fears\u201d. The Sun blows its own trumpet with: \u201cEgypt Brit saved by the Sun\u201d, reporting that Laura Palmer, from Hull, who was jailed in 2017 for smuggling painkillers, has been freed after being granted a pardon. The Mail leads on its great British spring clean campaign: \u201cWhat a start to our big spring clean!\u201d. And the Mirror leads on its own investigation: \u201cStop online giants who help kill our kids\u201d is its headline.

      "bodyText": "The skies over the UK and Normandy will be filled with wartime Dakota aircraft as hundreds of parachutists take part in a mass airdrop to mark the 75th anniversary of the D-day landings in June. The plans, unveiled by Imperial War Museums (IWM), are part of a programme on an \u201cunprecedented scale\u201d for the commemoration of the greatest seaborne invasion in history, to liberate Europe from Nazi occupation, on 6 June 1944. An official international ceremony is planned for one of the famous Normandy beaches, and is expected to be attended by many Allied heads of state, anticipated to include the US president, Donald Trump, and representatives from the royal family. Before the formal commemoration, up to 300 parachutists will jump into the historic drop zones from a fleet of Dakotas, the \u201cwinged workhorses\u201d that supported the airborne assault on German forces. They will take off from IWM Duxford in Cambridgeshire, formerly RAF Duxford, Britain\u2019s best preserved wartime airfield, from where US fighter aircraft flew in support of D-day operations. With more than 30 Dakotas gathering, it will be the first time since the second world war that so many of the aircraft have been assembled in the place that saw their finest hour. As part of history in the remaking, the parachutists will board the aircraft as they did 75 years ago and fly across the Channel to Normandy for the mass airdrop, organised by Daks Over Normandy. Few Normandy veterans are still living. The Royal British Legion, together with the Ministry of Defence, is taking 300 veterans to France on a specially chartered ship for the anniversary and is inviting applications. The Battle of Normandy, or Operation Overlord, was planned in huge secrecy. By midnight on 6 June, 156,000 Allied troops had arrived, with many cut down on the beaches where they landed by fierce German defences. An estimated 4,413 Allied soldiers died on the day of the invasion. By the end of D-day, the allies had established a foothold in France. Within 11 months, Nazi Germany was defeated. The amphibious assault was preceded by 24,000 troops who parachuted in or came by glider. Supporting the airborne assault were more than 800 Douglas C-47 Skytrains (Dakotas). A \u201cDaks over Duxford\u201d event will include air displays and mass parachute jumps at the airfield, before the Normandy airdrop, with tickets available through the IWM website. \u201cImperial War Museums marks the 75th anniversary of the D-day landings on an unprecedented scale this year, retelling this extraordinary story through our rich second world war collection,\u201d said John Brown, the IWM executive director. \u201cDaks over Duxford will be a momentous occasion with over 30 Dakota aircraft based at our historic airfield for two days of immersive activities before they fly en masse to Normandy; a poignant moment for all who witness it,\u201d he said. Ian Kikuchi, a senior curator historian at the Imperial War Museums, said: \u201cD-day was one of the decisive events of the second world war. The largest amphibious landings in history, D-day witnessed the culmination of years of planning and preparation. \u201cThe job of carrying out those complex plans fell to the courageous men and women of the Allied armed forces, whose effort and sacrifice paved the way for the liberation of western Europe from Nazi occupation, and for the peace enjoyed there to this day.\u201d Other events, to be announced by IWM, will take place at the Churchill War Rooms, the Whitehall nerve centre of strategic planning, and aboard HMS Belfast on the Thames.

That\u2019s also the title of a book of the images, <a href=\"https://brownseditions.com/product/only-god-can-judge-me/\">published by London-based Browns Editions</a>, run by artist and designer Jonathan Ellery. \u201cBy talking about what happened to his mum, Bruce is showing us where his photographs really come from,\u201d Ellery says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t need to give us that insight. It was his decision to do so. And it changes everything.\u201d</p> <p>Gilden was born in Brooklyn in 1946. His father, Daniel, was a \u201ctough guy, a mafioso-type figure\u201d \u2013 a streetwise New Yorker with gold rings arranged on his fingers and a cigar always to hand. \u201cAnd my mother was pretty, your average housewife,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cBut I would hear my parents talk in their room at night. The conversations were too disturbing and graphic to be discussed publicly. I heard things that no child should ever know.\u201d He remembers, after such arguments, Pauline bursting into his room with cigarette burns on her chest. On other occasions, he can remember \u201cseeing her in the middle of the afternoon going up the stairs with a man in the house where we lived\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWitnessing all of this was devastating,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt ashamed, hurt, completely at a loss \u2013 but I couldn\u2019t stop listening, no matter how much it hurt.

Photographing these women, and indeed photography in general, has been a form of catharsis. \u201cI don\u2019t do this to exploit people,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s who I am.

But as his recognition grew he started to struggle with addiction himself. His mother\u2019s problems were also growing, and by the time Gilden had turned 30, she had been detained in a secure psychiatric unit. Gilden remembers taking the train out to the secure unit to visit her one Christmas. He took a portrait of her \u201cwhen she weighed about 80 pounds, because she was starving herself to death\u201d. He has kept the portrait, but has never shown it to anyone.</p> <p>Several years later, only two short weeks after the death of his father, Gilden received a call: his mother had killed herself in the asylum.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to help her,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s when I really went off the end (with drugs). I went on a bender. It was too much for me to handle.\u201d</p> <p>Gilden has since made a life for himself \u2013 he\u2019s now clean, happily married and living in Beacon, a forest-ringed city in Dutchess County, New York state. But Only God Can Judge Me brought memories of his past back to him. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>If someone can look at these and feel like they\u2019re not alone in the world, then I\u2019ve done my job</p> <footer> <cite>Bruce Gilden</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For the first time in his career, he decided to couple his portraits with quotes from the women photographed. The words are as unsparing as his portraits. Trish, an older Jewish woman, told Gilden: \u201cI was one of those ladies who lunch, a married woman. Then I started taking pain pills at the age of 30 because I have chronic pain. I had never taken a drug prior to that and I said, \u2018Oh my God, I feel so much better!\u2019 And that was it.

I\u2019m 39 now. I started using drugs with my parents, who were addicts and dealers. I thought it was normal. I was put in foster homes but I kept running away. I would always find myself in these areas. I never knew what I was running from, but now I know I was just looking for guidance. I never had that.\u201d</p> <p>A younger woman, April, told Gilden of being raped as a child by her grandfather. \u201cI tried to tell my parents once, but they didn\u2019t believe me. I got in trouble so I never brought it up again until his funeral, when I walked up to his casket and spit in his face and told everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Gilden hopes these images might give someone slipping into addiction a moment of pause. \u201cIf someone can look at these and feel like they\u2019re not alone in the world, then I\u2019ve done my job,\u201d he says. But there\u2019s something else at play here \u2013 a defiant stare at those who have so manifestly misunderstood his work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/aug/19/bruce-gilden-face-street-portraits-photographs-book\">A latter-day freak show?

His mother\u2019s problems were also growing, and by the time Gilden had turned 30, she had been detained in a secure psychiatric unit. Gilden remembers taking the train out to the secure unit to visit her one Christmas. He took a portrait of her \u201cwhen she weighed about 80 pounds, because she was starving herself to death\u201d. He has kept the portrait, but has never shown it to anyone. Several years later, only two short weeks after the death of his father, Gilden received a call: his mother had killed herself in the asylum. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to help her,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s when I really went off the end (with drugs). I went on a bender. It was too much for me to handle.\u201d Gilden has since made a life for himself \u2013 he\u2019s now clean, happily married and living in Beacon, a forest-ringed city in Dutchess County, New York state. But Only God Can Judge Me brought memories of his past back to him. For the first time in his career, he decided to couple his portraits with quotes from the women photographed. The words are as unsparing as his portraits. Trish, an older Jewish woman, told Gilden: \u201cI was one of those ladies who lunch, a married woman. Then I started taking pain pills at the age of 30 because I have chronic pain. I had never taken a drug prior to that and I said, \u2018Oh my God, I feel so much better!\u2019 And that was it. That got a hold on me and this is where I wound up.\u201d Jessica, a dark-haired woman with the tattoo, told Gilden: \u201cI have been on the street since I was 14. I\u2019m 39 now. I started using drugs with my parents, who were addicts and dealers. I thought it was normal. I was put in foster homes but I kept running away. I would always find myself in these areas. I never knew what I was running from, but now I know I was just looking for guidance. I never had that.\u201d A younger woman, April, told Gilden of being raped as a child by her grandfather. \u201cI tried to tell my parents once, but they didn\u2019t believe me. I got in trouble so I never brought it up again until his funeral, when I walked up to his casket and spit in his face and told everyone.\u201d Gilden hopes these images might give someone slipping into addiction a moment of pause. \u201cIf someone can look at these and feel like they\u2019re not alone in the world, then I\u2019ve done my job,\u201d he says. But there\u2019s something else at play here \u2013 a defiant stare at those who have so manifestly misunderstood his work. \u201cThese women \u2013 they\u2019re not just left behind, they\u2019re invisible,\u201d Gilden says. \u201cI like to make people look at them \u2013 to make them see. A lot of people have difficulty with that. And that always interests me. Why would you not want to look at these faces? Because this can happen to anyone\u2019s loved one.\u201d The book is dedicated to Gilden\u2019s wife, Sophie, his daughter Nina and, on a separate page, \u201cfor my mother\u201d. \u201cIt has taken me my whole life to deal with what happened to her,\u201d Gilden says. Meeting the women of Overtown \u201cgave me the courage to face it. I owe them a lot for that.\u201d \u2022 Only God Can Judge Me is available from Browns Editions",

Don\u2019t industrial farms produce most of the world\u2019s food?</h2> <p>No. There are more than 570m farms worldwide; more than 90% are run by an individual or family and rely primarily on family labour. They produce about 80% of the world\u2019s food.</p> <p>Small farmers will be key to the transition, says Ronald Vargas, soil and land officer at the FAO.

They have given farmers in remote areas access to tools such as weather forecasts, market prices, yield information and practical advice. GPS is also allowing them to track their produce after it leaves the farm.</p> <p>Drones and robots may seem futuristic but are already in use, delivering targeted pesticides and picking out damaged or diseased crops before they can infect others around them.</p> <p>In parts of the world where space is at a premium, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/feb/06/vertical-farming-explained-erik-murchie\">vertical farming</a> is catching on. This refers to the practice of stacking crops, usually vegetables, in shallow containers in layers, which can reach any height available. It not only saves on space, but can also be managed to use water and energy more efficiently, as water can be pumped to the top and allowed to flow down by gravity.</p> <p>Some systems use hydroponics, by which the plants are immersed in water containing mineral solutions, in place of soil. Temperatures can be carefully controlled, water reused, and nutrients recycled. Software systems can control the delivery mechanisms and monitor how the plants are faring.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTKuOvoIXsU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dTKuOvoIXsU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Beating the drought in Egypt</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Our new-found abilities to control light, temperature, air and other environmental factors open up new vistas for farming. Underground growing used to be reserved for mushrooms and niche crops such as forced rhubarb, grown in large warehouses.</p> <p>If LEDs can take the place of sunlight, a far greater variety of plants can thrive in these conditions, making not only rooftops but basements and disused underground spaces from worked-out mines to old railway lines potentially viable venues for growing short-cycle foodstuffs.</p> <h2>What next?</h2> <p>Our reliance on artificial fertiliser and intensive farming techniques did not happen overnight, but took decades. Along the way, these methods revolutionised farming and enabled huge population growth and economic growth. We now have a wealth of scientific evidence that shows that continuing down the same path would risk runaway climate change, the extinction of species vital to human life, pollution of our water and air, and the death of our soils.</p> <p>\u201cIndustrial agriculture exploits the available natural resources of our planet to an untenable and unsustainable extent,\u201d says Vargas of the FAO. \u201cThe basic strategy to replace human labour with farm machinery, agrochemicals and fossil energy is a dead end in times of climate change, dwindling oil reserves and over-exploited natural resources.\u201d</p> <p>Experts say a second revolution is now needed, that will encompass not just our growing methods but consumption habits and our entire food economy. This would have to involve farmers, retailers, governments and consumers. In last century\u2019s farming revolution, only one future was offered: industrialisation. For this century, there will be a plurality of alternatives, and combinations of new and ancient technology, and all have their place.</p> <p>\u201cThere is not one huge conceptual change where you do everything differently and everything will be OK,\u201d says Tim Searchinger of Princeton University and the World Resources Institute. \u201cThere is not one single answer. There are lots and lots of things we can and need to do.\u201d</p>",

No. There are more than 570m farms worldwide; more than 90% are run by an individual or family and rely primarily on family labour. They produce about 80% of the world\u2019s food. Small farmers will be key to the transition, says Ronald Vargas, soil and land officer at the FAO. Many small farmers are poor and insecure, but FAO considers investment in smallholder production \u201cthe most urgent and secure and promising means of combating hunger and malnutrition, while minimising the ecological impact of agriculture\u201d. How can technology and innovation help? There is no shortage of innovation and tech to help improve efficiencies and yields \u2013 on industrial farms and smallholdings. GPS, drones and fine-grained data on topography, soils and other aspects of farmland to allow farmers to target specific areas with fertilisers, pesticides and water, instead of blanket spraying. For instance, Olam, a global agribusiness that produces cocoa, coffee, sugar, cotton and other crops, uses real-time monitoring on its plantations to finely judge fertiliser quantities and avoid the need for the pre-emptive use of pesticides. Its almond trees in Australia are fitted with sensors to monitor exactly how much water each tree needs, and when. For family farmers in the developing world, mobile phones are revolutionising what is possible. They have given farmers in remote areas access to tools such as weather forecasts, market prices, yield information and practical advice. GPS is also allowing them to track their produce after it leaves the farm. Drones and robots may seem futuristic but are already in use, delivering targeted pesticides and picking out damaged or diseased crops before they can infect others around them. In parts of the world where space is at a premium, vertical farming is catching on. This refers to the practice of stacking crops, usually vegetables, in shallow containers in layers, which can reach any height available. It not only saves on space, but can also be managed to use water and energy more efficiently, as water can be pumped to the top and allowed to flow down by gravity. Some systems use hydroponics, by which the plants are immersed in water containing mineral solutions, in place of soil. Temperatures can be carefully controlled, water reused, and nutrients recycled. Software systems can control the delivery mechanisms and monitor how the plants are faring. Our new-found abilities to control light, temperature, air and other environmental factors open up new vistas for farming. Underground growing used to be reserved for mushrooms and niche crops such as forced rhubarb, grown in large warehouses. If LEDs can take the place of sunlight, a far greater variety of plants can thrive in these conditions, making not only rooftops but basements and disused underground spaces from worked-out mines to old railway lines potentially viable venues for growing short-cycle foodstuffs. What next? Our reliance on artificial fertiliser and intensive farming techniques did not happen overnight, but took decades. Along the way, these methods revolutionised farming and enabled huge population growth and economic growth. We now have a wealth of scientific evidence that shows that continuing down the same path would risk runaway climate change, the extinction of species vital to human life, pollution of our water and air, and the death of our soils. \u201cIndustrial agriculture exploits the available natural resources of our planet to an untenable and unsustainable extent,\u201d says Vargas of the FAO. \u201cThe basic strategy to replace human labour with farm machinery, agrochemicals and fossil energy is a dead end in times of climate change, dwindling oil reserves and over-exploited natural resources.\u201d Experts say a second revolution is now needed, that will encompass not just our growing methods but consumption habits and our entire food economy. This would have to involve farmers, retailers, governments and consumers. In last century\u2019s farming revolution, only one future was offered: industrialisation. For this century, there will be a plurality of alternatives, and combinations of new and ancient technology, and all have their place. \u201cThere is not one huge conceptual change where you do everything differently and everything will be OK,\u201d says Tim Searchinger of Princeton University and the World Resources Institute. \u201cThere is not one single answer. There are lots and lots of things we can and need to do.\u201d",

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/28/global-food-system-is-broken-say-worlds-science-academies\" title=\"\">global food system</a> is responsible for up to 30% of total greenhouse gas emissions, the livestock sector on its own accounting for about half of that total or 14.5%. The modern western way of eating is also making very large numbers of people fat and sick as other parts of the world adopt it. Diet-related diseases now cause roughly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/08/poor-diet-a-factor-in-one-fifth-of-global-deaths-in-2017-study\" title=\"\">11 million deaths</a> a year as preventable cancers, heart disease and strokes, obesity and diabetes have spread along with our way of eating. More than 800 million people are estimated to be <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/361/bmj.k2238\" title=\"\">chronically undernourished</a>, and 2 billion suffer from <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/x0245e/x0245e01.htm#P38_2721\" title=\"\">micronutrient deficiencies</a>, yet at the same time 2 billion are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/20/obesity-bigger-cost-than-war-and-terror\" title=\"\">overweight or obese</a>. In poorer counties you can even find obesity and stunting within the same family as calorie-heavy but nutrient-light processed industrialised foods are adopted.</p> <p>In other words, something has gone horribly wrong and we don\u2019t have much time to fix it. The so-called \u201creference diet\u201d, published in the first Lancet report, has caused uproar in some quarters. This is a theoretical attempt to answer the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_trap\" title=\"\">Malthusian question</a>: if the global population reaches 10 billion by 2050 (as is anticipated), will there be enough food to meet everyone\u2019s basic nutritional needs without cutting down more forest, polluting more water courses and generally destroying the planet? The answer it comes up with is yes, but only if we share things out differently, and stop feeding a quarter of the world\u2019s grain to animals.</p> <p>The reference diet models each person globally having 14g of red meat a day, 29g of chicken, a fraction of an egg, 250g of dairy, a little fat or oil, very little sugar, and lots of grains and lentils, vegetables and nuts. And here\u2019s where the trouble begins, because calculated day by day and universally these allocations make for a pretty depressing plateful. They contain some odd judgments. Why favour industrialised chicken? Why palm oil? They are plain weird if you try to interpret them as daily instructions without thinking about the diet as a whole or what\u2019s available to people locally \u2013 hence the one-fifth of an egg, the quarter rasher of bacon. People don\u2019t shop and eat by numbers and fractions. And the fact that nutrition epidemiology \u2013 the study of patterns in diet and disease \u2013 has got it wrong before does not help. Remember when fears about dietary cholesterol were used to condemn eggs? These instructions sound top down and, worse, appear to throw responsibility back to the individual.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>More than 800 million people are estimated to be chronically undernourished, yet 2 billion are overweight or obese</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But that is to miss the point of these instructions. They are calculations that give a sense of the scale of the problem and a science-based framework for political action. Contrary to some <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6613823/Billionaire-tucks-20-000-calorie-burger-despite-funding-study-calling-meat-consumption-cut.html\" title=\"\">claims</a>, the Lancet commission that undertook the modelling, supported by the philanthropic EAT Foundation, received <a href=\"https://eatforum.org/eat-lancet-commission/eat-lancet-funding/\" title=\"\">no funding</a> from industry. And the uncomfortable truth is that meat, and specifically the meat from intensively-fed livestock, processed in the way it generally is in the western diet, is a hotspot when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions and ill health. Well-produced meat and dairy can have a place, but it will be a small one, and it is expensive.</p> <p>Our diets are out of kilter with what\u2019s good for both us and the planet because powerful vested interests and misplaced economic incentives have driven them in that direction, and this is the thesis underlying the commission\u2019s findings. The equivalent of $500bn in agricultural subsidies goes each year to the wrong sort of food \u2013 corn, soya, meat and dairy, as cheap raw materials for intensive livestock production and for highly processed foods. About $5tn a year goes in subsidies to the fossil fuels which industrialised agriculture uses so profligately. Big food has spent hundreds of millions advertising unhealthy food and lobbying to block the sort of measures that might help shift consumption.</p> <p>Although individuals can make a difference by modifying their diets, and send clear demands for action to politicians , we cannot redraw the food system on our own. That will require not just governments, but global agreement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/24/should-we-stop-eating-meat-not-while-humans-are-the-real-weapons-of-climate-destruction\">Should we stop eating meat? Not when humans are the real weapons of climate destruction | Tony Lovell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Lancet says the problem is so big and so urgent that we need an intergovernmental convention to agree a way forward, in the way that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or the World Health Organization\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control have. Expect plenty of hysterical, dark-money opposition to that. The Lancet, founded in the 19th century, caused uproar back then by publishing the unwelcomenews that food was routinely adulterated. It has once again kickstarted a vital debate about how we eat. If it all sounds too gloomy, it\u2019s worth remembering that the modern western diet is a recent invention. The separation of livestock from the land only took off in the 1950s, thanks to cheap energy to keep animals housed, to synthetic fertilisers increasing grain production for feed, and to mass production of antibiotics to control disease. It\u2019s not so very long since most people ate in the way we now need to rediscover. </p> <p>\u2022 Felicity Lawrence is a special correspondent for the Guardian and author of Not on the Label and Eat Your Heart Out</p>",

      "bodyText": "The distinguished medical journal The Lancet has issued not one but two apocalyptic warnings about our food in under a month. One of its special commissions reported earlier this month that civilisation itself was at risk from the effects of the current food system on both human health and the Earth\u2019s ecosystems. This week comes the next instalment from another special Lancet commission which finds that pandemics of obesity and malnutrition are interacting with climate change in a feedback loop and represent an existential threat to humans and the planet. The modern western diet has become a highly damaging thing that needs a complete overhaul if we are to avoid potential ecological catastrophe. It concluded that we need to halve global meat consumption, and more than double the volume of whole grains, pulses, nuts, fruit and vegetables we eat. Cue howls of indignation from big food and its cheerleaders, the libertarian right. Those nanny statists have gone nuts eating their own double dose of nuts! Cue cries of distress from champions of local, low-impact agriculture who include grass-fed animals, and their meat and manure, in their sustainable mix. These self-appointed experts don\u2019t understand farming! Cue grim food wheels with only a quarter of a rasher of bacon or a fifth of an egg a day. Those miserabilist medics want us all to go vegan! Yet the evidence that our diets are the largest cause of climate change and biodiversity loss is now overwhelming. The global food system is responsible for up to 30% of total greenhouse gas emissions, the livestock sector on its own accounting for about half of that total or 14.5%. The modern western way of eating is also making very large numbers of people fat and sick as other parts of the world adopt it. Diet-related diseases now cause roughly 11 million deaths a year as preventable cancers, heart disease and strokes, obesity and diabetes have spread along with our way of eating. More than 800 million people are estimated to be chronically undernourished, and 2 billion suffer from micronutrient deficiencies, yet at the same time 2 billion are overweight or obese. In poorer counties you can even find obesity and stunting within the same family as calorie-heavy but nutrient-light processed industrialised foods are adopted. In other words, something has gone horribly wrong and we don\u2019t have much time to fix it. The so-called \u201creference diet\u201d, published in the first Lancet report, has caused uproar in some quarters. This is a theoretical attempt to answer the Malthusian question: if the global population reaches 10 billion by 2050 (as is anticipated), will there be enough food to meet everyone\u2019s basic nutritional needs without cutting down more forest, polluting more water courses and generally destroying the planet? The answer it comes up with is yes, but only if we share things out differently, and stop feeding a quarter of the world\u2019s grain to animals. The reference diet models each person globally having 14g of red meat a day, 29g of chicken, a fraction of an egg, 250g of dairy, a little fat or oil, very little sugar, and lots of grains and lentils, vegetables and nuts. And here\u2019s where the trouble begins, because calculated day by day and universally these allocations make for a pretty depressing plateful. They contain some odd judgments. Why favour industrialised chicken? Why palm oil? They are plain weird if you try to interpret them as daily instructions without thinking about the diet as a whole or what\u2019s available to people locally \u2013 hence the one-fifth of an egg, the quarter rasher of bacon. People don\u2019t shop and eat by numbers and fractions. And the fact that nutrition epidemiology \u2013 the study of patterns in diet and disease \u2013 has got it wrong before does not help. Remember when fears about dietary cholesterol were used to condemn eggs? These instructions sound top down and, worse, appear to throw responsibility back to the individual. But that is to miss the point of these instructions. They are calculations that give a sense of the scale of the problem and a science-based framework for political action. Contrary to some claims, the Lancet commission that undertook the modelling, supported by the philanthropic EAT Foundation, received no funding from industry. And the uncomfortable truth is that meat, and specifically the meat from intensively-fed livestock, processed in the way it generally is in the western diet, is a hotspot when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions and ill health. Well-produced meat and dairy can have a place, but it will be a small one, and it is expensive. Our diets are out of kilter with what\u2019s good for both us and the planet because powerful vested interests and misplaced economic incentives have driven them in that direction, and this is the thesis underlying the commission\u2019s findings. The equivalent of $500bn in agricultural subsidies goes each year to the wrong sort of food \u2013 corn, soya, meat and dairy, as cheap raw materials for intensive livestock production and for highly processed foods. About $5tn a year goes in subsidies to the fossil fuels which industrialised agriculture uses so profligately. Big food has spent hundreds of millions advertising unhealthy food and lobbying to block the sort of measures that might help shift consumption. Although individuals can make a difference by modifying their diets, and send clear demands for action to politicians , we cannot redraw the food system on our own. That will require not just governments, but global agreement. The Lancet says the problem is so big and so urgent that we need an intergovernmental convention to agree a way forward, in the way that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or the World Health Organization\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control have. Expect plenty of hysterical, dark-money opposition to that. The Lancet, founded in the 19th century, caused uproar back then by publishing the unwelcomenews that food was routinely adulterated. It has once again kickstarted a vital debate about how we eat. If it all sounds too gloomy, it\u2019s worth remembering that the modern western diet is a recent invention. The separation of livestock from the land only took off in the 1950s, thanks to cheap energy to keep animals housed, to synthetic fertilisers increasing grain production for feed, and to mass production of antibiotics to control disease. It\u2019s not so very long since most people ate in the way we now need to rediscover. \u2022 Felicity Lawrence is a special correspondent for the Guardian and author of Not on the Label and Eat Your Heart Out",

Now our water is safe.\u201d</p> <p>In the capital, Monrovia, Major General Prince Johnson, chief of staff for the commander of the Liberian Army, says: \u201cWe are losing a huge amount \u2013 millions of dollars \u2013 to illegal fishing.</p> <p>\u201cSince the coming in of Sea Shepherd, Liberia has benefitted a lot. Those who do illegal activities in our waters know they can no longer carry on.\u201d</p> <p>Data given to the Guardian by the Liberian MoD shows the impact the operation has had in just two years. Arrests have more than quadruped, the range of coastguard patrols have doubled, and the government has recovered at least a million dollars in fines.</p> <p>In the seven years prior to Sola Stella, the coastguard made only three arrests. One of the vessels, South Korea-flagged Nine Star, remains rusting in Monrovia\u2019s port after its owners abandoned it, leaving $1.5m in unpaid fines, in 2013.</p> <p>But from February 2017 to January this year, arrests rose to 14. Among them were two internationally blacklisted vessels. The Hai Lung, an Antarctic and Patagonian toothfish vessel, was suspected of absconding from authorities in Nigerian waters, and found to have forged Indonesian documentation, while the Liberia-flagged Labiko 2 was blacklisted by three different organisations under its previous name, the Maine. The latter was using gill nets, instead of the long lines for which it had a licence, and was fishing for deep-water sharks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7a7369e23c0ab5f036f9e8b888349d33342a8e70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a7369e23c0ab5f036f9e8b888349d33342a8e70/0_0_2000_1335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fishermen aboard the Oriental Kim haul in the morning\u2019s catch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fishermen aboard the Oriental Kim haul in the morning\u2019s catch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicole Schafer/Sea Shepherd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Five of the 14 vessels were found guilty of illegally fishing, the rest were found guilty of related crimes, including fraud, tax evasion and under-reporting catches.

The fishermen there have another word for what foreign vessels are guilty of.</p> <p>\u201cThey are stealing what is ours,\u201d says town governor Kofu Weah. \u201cThey come into Liberia, take the fish and then they leave.\u201d</p> <p>Robertsport\u2019s fishermen, who go out alone in small boats, or in groups with larger, motorised canoes, say the industrial foreign trawlers often cut through their nets, costing them between $150 and $1,500, depending on the size, and often capsizing their boats.</p> <p>Emmanuel Frances, 36, says: \u201cI\u2019ve been fishing my whole life. We sometimes leave the nets and go elsewhere. But when we return we could find the net gone. Trawlers cut through them.\u201d</p> <p>A good catch, for 25 men in a motorised canoe, would make just over a US dollar each for a night\u2019s work \u2013 not enough to pay for new nets. They welcome the joint patrols, which they sometimes see from shore, and say the number of incursions into their waters from foreign trawlers has fallen.</p> <p>Ibrahim Turey, 43, a newscaster at the local Radio Pisco station says: \u201cIllegal fishing was rampant, in the war and afterwards.

It is happening over the horizon, out of sight.\u201d</p> <p>He gestures at the vast expanse of ocean around us.</p> <p>\u201cOut there, you can see the over-reaching arm of the industrial fishing industry. The ocean cannot sustain that level of fishing. The scale is enormous. And then, there is a social justice element. There are 33,000 people in Liberia dependent on fish. And the Chinese and the EU steal it from under their noses. It is important to understand the battle that developing nations face.\u201d</p>",

Vaffe argues that even legal fishing by foreign vessels in Liberia\u2019s water is unfair, due to what he describes as a \u201cflawed\u201d system of cheap licences issued by the National Fisheries and Aquaculture Authority. \u201cThese vessels don\u2019t take the fish to bring them back to African ports, they take them to Europe and elsewhere,\u201d says Vaffe. \u201cThey benefit a lot, influencing their economy. To the detriment of our economy. They are also creating unemployment among the local fishermen. The cost is huge.\u201d In Robertsport, one of Liberia\u2019s main fishing communities, near the Sierra Leone border, narrow wooden canoes line the beach. The fishermen there have another word for what foreign vessels are guilty of. \u201cThey are stealing what is ours,\u201d says town governor Kofu Weah. \u201cThey come into Liberia, take the fish and then they leave.\u201d Robertsport\u2019s fishermen, who go out alone in small boats, or in groups with larger, motorised canoes, say the industrial foreign trawlers often cut through their nets, costing them between $150 and $1,500, depending on the size, and often capsizing their boats. Emmanuel Frances, 36, says: \u201cI\u2019ve been fishing my whole life. We sometimes leave the nets and go elsewhere. But when we return we could find the net gone. Trawlers cut through them.\u201d A good catch, for 25 men in a motorised canoe, would make just over a US dollar each for a night\u2019s work \u2013 not enough to pay for new nets. They welcome the joint patrols, which they sometimes see from shore, and say the number of incursions into their waters from foreign trawlers has fallen. Ibrahim Turey, 43, a newscaster at the local Radio Pisco station says: \u201cIllegal fishing was rampant, in the war and afterwards. But they are no longer coming here with their boats. We see Sea Shepherd out there on patrol.\u201d On the bridge of the Sam Simon, captain Alistair Allan, 27, a tattooed Australian who has worked with Sea Shepherd since he was 19, says he believes the campaign against illegal and unregulated fishing is vital for the planet. \u201cHumankind has thought of the ocean as a never-ending resource. It\u2019s so vast, how can we make a dent in it? But we\u2019re not just making a dent in it, we are wrecking the whole thing. It is happening over the horizon, out of sight.\u201d He gestures at the vast expanse of ocean around us. \u201cOut there, you can see the over-reaching arm of the industrial fishing industry. The ocean cannot sustain that level of fishing. The scale is enormous. And then, there is a social justice element. There are 33,000 people in Liberia dependent on fish. And the Chinese and the EU steal it from under their noses. It is important to understand the battle that developing nations face.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Studio 10 co-host Kerri-Anne Kennerley has been accused of racism by fellow panellist Yumi Stynes after the veteran presenter talked about sexual violence in Indigenous communities during a discussion about Invasion Day protests. Kennerley attacked the motives of the protesters who want the date of Australia Day changed by implying they were ignoring the alleged rape of children and women in the \u201coutback\u201d. \u201cHas any single one of those 5,000 people waving the flags saying how inappropriate the day is, has any one of them been out to the outback where children, where babies and five-year-olds are being raped, their mothers are being raped, their sisters are being raped. They get no education,\u201d Kennerley said on the Ten morning show. Tens of thousands of people joined Invasion Day marches around the country on Saturday calling for the public holiday to be abolished, with the largest gathering in Melbourne. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d Kennerley hypothetically asked the Invasion Day protesters. \u201cZippo!\u201d Stynes, a guest presenter, was the only one to respond, saying: \u201cThat is not even faintly true Kerri-Anne and you\u2019re sounding quite racist now.\u201d Kennerley, one of television\u2019s most recognisable faces with a string of hit shows to her name, hit back angrily, saying \u201cI\u2019m offended by that, Yumi\u201d. Stynes: \u201cWell, keep going then, because every time you open your mouth, you\u2019re sounding racist. Kennerley said \u201cAboriginal elder women\u201d were desperate for help to prevent sexual violence in their communities but the Australia Day protesters had done \u201cnothing\u201d. \u201cWhere are these people on one day of the year? You\u2019d be better off going and doing something positive,\u201d she said. Stynes said Kennerley\u2019s implication was that \u201cwomen aren\u2019t being raped here in big cities and children aren\u2019t being raped here in big cities\u201d and she defended the protesters. \u201cWith that statement, you\u2019re actually implying that those 5,000 protesters, none of whom you know personally, are all lazy and idle and indolent,\u201d she said. It\u2019s the second time in as many weeks the issue of changing the date of Australia Day has erupted on commercial television. Ten days ago the Today show\u2019s new entertainment reporter Brooke Boney, an Indigenous woman, was challenged by the sports reporter Tony Jones when she said she would like the date to change. \u201cBut I can\u2019t separate the 26th of January from the fact that my brothers are more likely to go to jail than school, or that my little sisters and my mum are more likely to be beaten and raped than anyone else\u2019s sisters or mum,\u201d Boney said on Today.",

But two of this year\u2019s leading Oscar nominees, Roma and The Favourite, were bypassed in the main by the Actor\u2019s Guild. While The Favourite received SAG nominations for its leading female actors, Roma was omitted entirely. Meanwhile, both films landed a massive 10 Oscar nominations each on Tuesday. Emily Blunt won the award for best female actor in a supporting role in the motion picture section of the awards for her role in the horror film, A Quiet Place, beating Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz, whose performances in The Favourite have caused significant Oscar buzz. Mahershala Ali took home the award for best male supporting actor for his role in Green Book. In the TV categories, Sandra Oh\u2019s much-lauded performance in Killing Eve netted her the award for best female actor in a drama series, while Jason Bateman received the corresponding award for a male performer for his performance in the money laundering family drama, Ozark. The Marvelous Mrs Maisel won every category it was nominated in, with Tony Shalhoud and Rachel Brosnahan receiving the awards for outstanding male and female actor in a comedy series respectively, and the entire cast receiving the award for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a comedy series. Darren Criss\u2019 performance in The Assassination of Gianni Versace and Patricia Arquette\u2019s turn in Escape at Dannemora also received accolades. The cast of This is Us received the award for best ensemble in a drama series, while Glow, the Netflix series about professional women wrestlers, won best stunt ensemble in a comedy or drama series. Ozark and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel both received the most nominations, with four nods in three categories. Barry, Glow, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and The Kominsky Method followed close behind with three nominations each. The ceremony also saw Tom Hanks present the SAG Life Achievement Award to Alan Alda, who is most famous for playing Dr Hawkeye Pierce on M*A*S*H for 11 seasons. Throughout his career Alda has won six Emmy awards, six Golden Globes, been inducted into the Television Hall of Fame and undertaken extensive charity work. \u201cIt may never have been more urgent to see the world through another person\u2019s eyes,\u201d Alda said when accepting his award on Sunday night. \u201cAnd when the culture is divided so sharply, actors can help, at least a little, just by doing what we do.\u201d Ahead of this year\u2019s show, the Screen Actors Guild took the unusual step of publicly criticising the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for pressuring stars to appear only on the Oscars. The film academy has declined to comment. \u2022 Associated Press contributed to this report Full list of winners from the 25th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards Film Female actor in a leading role \u2013 Glenn Close, The Wife Male actor in a leading role \u2013 Rami Malek, Bohemian Rhapsody Female actor in a supporting role \u2013 Emily Blunt, A Quiet Place Male actor in a supporting role \u2013 Mahershala Ali, Green Book Cast in a motion picture \u2013 Black Panther Stunt ensemble in a motion picture \u2013 Black Panther Television Female actor in a television movie or limited series \u2013 Patricia Arquette, Escape at Dannemora Male actor in a television movie or limited series \u2013 Darren Criss, The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story Female actor in a drama series \u2013 Sandra Oh, Killing Eve Male actor in a drama series \u2013 Jason Bateman, Ozark Female actor in a comedy series \u2013 Rachel Brosnahan, The Marveous Mrs Maisel Male actor in a comedy series \u2013 Tony Shalhoub, The Marvelous Mrs Maisel Ensemble in a drama series \u2013 This is Us Ensemble in a comedy series \u2013 The Marvelous Mrs Maisel Stunt ensemble in a comedy or drama series \u2013 Glow",

But then these friends head off on their travels, leaving her alone in the flat. It is at this stage that the vampirish figure of Anthony makes his appearance: a supercilious, opinionated young man with a chalkstripe suit and a junior position at the Foreign Office. He has an insidious knack of playing on Julie\u2019s insecurities, by asking pointedly sceptical, quizzical questions about her work and airily claiming to admire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/26/2\">Powell and Pressburger</a>.

She is the daughter of Tilda Swinton (and in fact we last saw Swinton Byrne in Tilda Swinton\u2019s short film about her personal friend John Berger, part of a collection of four pieces about the late author and critic, entitled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/21/the-seasons-in-quincy-four-portraits-of-john-berger-review-tilda-swinton\">The Seasons in Quincy</a>, in which Berger was shown giving Honor a hair-raising motorbike lesson).

      "bodyText": "Zali Steggall has promised not to direct preferences to other candidates and says the government should be more ambitious on emissions reduction than Labor as she makes her pitch to replace Tony Abbott in Warringah. The independent candidate told Guardian Australia that Abbott had \u201ccontinually denied climate change\u201d and the conversation had \u201cmoved on\u201d from carbon pricing because renewables were already cheaper than coal. Steggall\u2019s candidacy was welcomed on Monday by Labor and the independent MP for Wentworth, Kerryn Phelps, who said people were \u201cdisillusioned by the performance of the Liberal party\u201d on issues including climate change and marriage equality. Abbott holds Warringah with a primary vote of 51.65% and a two-party preferred vote of 61.55% but is being challenged by independents including Steggall, who is a lawyer and former Olympic skier, the Indigenous broadcaster Susan Moylan-Coombs and Alice Thompson, a former employee of the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull. The dumping of Turnbull in August has caused MP Julia Banks to join the crossbench and has been a major hit to the Coalition\u2019s vote in progressive Liberal seats such as Kooyong, where a high-profile independent is also expected to enter the field. The Herald Sun has reported that Banks is considering moving from her marginal seat of Chisholm to take on the health minister, Greg Hunt, in Flinders. On Monday Steggall said Warringah was a \u201ca very savvy electorate\u201d and \u201cas an independent it\u2019s important to let people make up own mind\u201d about their preferences. Asked if failing to direct preferences might help Abbott retain the seat, Steggall replied that \u201ca broad part of my base are moderate Liberal supporters\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re asking voters to think carefully about how they vote and I\u2019m asking for people\u2019s first preference,\u201d she said. \u201cTo succeed, we need to bring down the primary vote of the current member.\u201d Asked about carbon pricing, Steggall said that a multi-pronged approach was needed to fight climate change and the conversation had \u201cmoved on\u201d because there was \u201cno need for subsidies\u201d now that renewables were cheaper than coal power. \u201cWe need to set ambitious targets to accelerate the transition to clean energy and the orderly retirement of coal,\u201d she said. \u201cAbbott and politicians on the far right are proposing subsidising coal, to keep open something that is not cost effective.\u201d Steggall said she would release a full climate policy before the election but pointed to more ambitious state targets as evidence of a \u201cclear disconnect\u201d, where \u201cthe federal government hasn\u2019t been hearing people\u2019s desire to make a difference\u201d. Steggall said that Labor\u2019s emissions reduction target for electricity of 45% by 2030 was \u201ca start\u201d but was \u201cnot enough \u2013 we need to push for more\u201d. The Australian has reported that Abbott will write to voters that he has \u201cmore to do\u201d for the electorate and \u201cno one can fight harder for you and for our area than someone with the big megaphone that only a former PM has\u201d. \u201cMy other pledge is to do everything I humanly can to protect you from Labor\u2019s tax attack that will unfairly target people in Warringah with above-average incomes and assets,\u201d he reportedly says. Steggall expects to capitalise on grassroots organising against Abbott from local groups including Think Twice Warringah and Voices of Warringah, which she said sprung up due to \u201cgrowing dissent and dissatisfaction\u201d particularly at \u201cthe way the Liberal party conducted itself last year\u201d. Steggall said that Abbott \u2013 who has suggested climate change is \u201cprobably doing good\u201d \u2013 had \u201ccontinually denied climate change despite all the facts being in\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a fair assessment to say that he\u2019s unwilling or unable to move and not open to debate or discussion,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s entitled to take that far-right view but it doesn\u2019t reflect where this electorate is at. \u201cWarringah wants safe, sound and stable economic policy, but it\u2019s a caring progressive electorate.\u201d Labor frontbencher Andrew Leigh told Sky News the opposition would \u201cabsolutely\u201d still contest Warringah, describing the party\u2019s candidate, Dean Harris, a small business owner, as \u201ca great local bloke\u201d. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said that Abbott was a \u201cformidable and tough campaigner\u201d who could not be written off in Warringah. He told reporters in Melbourne that Steggall\u2019s nomination showed the government was \u201clurching from crisis to crisis\u201d as their own supporters were running against the Liberal party as independents. \u201cOn climate change \u2026 we agree that Tony Abbott has been a block on action on climate change \u2013 but it\u2019s not just him, it\u2019s the whole government.\u201d When asked about the potential for preferencing Steggall at the election, Shorten said: \u201cThis is an independent, she\u2019s just announced that she\u2019s running yesterday. We\u2019ll examine her policies.\u201d Phelps told Sky News she was \u201cvery very pleased\u201d that Steggall had decided to stand as an independent because voters were \u201cangry about a lot of the mismanagement they\u2019re seeing\u201d. \u201cWhat we need to see are more independents from the sensible centre who can be an antidote to the lurch to the right we\u2019re seeing from the Liberal party and Coalition government.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Asian Football Confederation claims its president, Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa, is not responsible for matters regarding the Thai detention of Hakeem al-Araibi because he was recused from overseeing the region 18 months ago out of conflict-of-interest concerns. The new claim came in response to a call from the World Players Association for Salman to be disqualified from office if the refugee footballer was returned to Bahrain. Salman, a Bahraini royal who is also vice president of Fifa, has been widely criticised for his lack of action in the two months since the arrest and detention of Bahraini refugee Al-Araibi. The AFC did not address the disqualification calls but on Saturday said its senior vice president, Praful Patel, \u201cwas asked 18 months ago by the AFC executive committee to handle matters involving the AFC\u2019s West Zone to ensure there were no accusations of a conflict of interest involving [Salman]\u201d. It said the AFC administration was in contact with Fifa and the football federations of Bahrain, Thailand and Australia, but did not call for Al-Araibi\u2019s release. Saturday\u2019s statement is the first the AFC has said of Salman\u2019s recusal. The AFC is increasingly alone in its failure to call for the release of the refugee footballer and Australian resident. Al-Araibi was arrested in Bangkok in November on a red notice issued to Bahrain by Interpol in contravention of its own refugee protection policies. Bahrain is seeking the return of Al-Araibi over a widely discredited vandalism conviction, delivered in absentia and carrying a 10-year prison sentence. The country\u2019s justice system has a well-documented history of prisoner abuse and targeting of dissidents. Through its director of communications, Colin Gibson, the AFC has previously only said that it is working with Fifa, repeatedly declining to answer questions about the role of Salman or its specific efforts to help Al-Araibi. AFC officials also shut down questions on the topic of Al-Araibi at an Asian Cup pre-match press conference with the Australian Socceroos last week. Salman is expected to run for the presidency of Fifa in April. During his last tilt at the top role in 2016, Salman was the subject of public criticism by Al-Araibi, which Al-Araibi believes is largely behind Bahrain\u2019s attempt to refoule him. World football organisations were widely criticised in the two months following Al-Araibi\u2019s arrest over their initial silence and then muted responses, but in the wake of international lobbying, many have since called for the athlete\u2019s return to Australia. Fifa recently lobbied the Thai government directly, but has still been criticised for not doing enough, and has been accused of abrogating its human rights responsibilities which require it to use all available means and leverage. On the same day as the AFC\u2019s statement, the International Olympic Committee announced its support of Al-Araibi and Fifa\u2019s position on his case \u2013 that he should be returned to Australia. It said the IOC member for Thailand, Khunying Patama Leeswadtrakul, had contacted the Thai government to try to find a solution based on \u201cbasic human and humanitarian values\u201d. \u201cThe IOC president has personally discussed this worrying situation with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees,\u201d the IOC added. \u201cThe high commissioner also expressed that UNHCR is very concerned about this case since Al-Araibi is a recognised refugee and should be allowed to return to Australia.\u201d A leading Thai football team, Chiang Rai United, has also voiced support of Al-Araibi. \u201cTo take a footballer and lock him up is to ruin his life, particularly when there is no reason in law to hold him,\u201d said club president Mitti Tiyapairat. On Sunday the president of the Jordanian Football Association, Ali Bin al-Hussein, called for Al-Araibi\u2019s release. \u201cYour silence as officials is a shame and a total embarrassment,\u201d he said in a tweet which tagged Fifa and the AFC, as well as the football associations of Thailand and Bahrain, and Australia\u2019s national team. \u201cProtect your players.\u201d On Monday morning an Australian cave diver who helped rescue the young Thai footballers in July, told the ABC \u201cit does seem the gentleman concerned is the victim of a pretty grave injustice\u201d. Retired vet Craig Challen \u2013 who alongside anaesthetist Richard Harris was jointly named Australian of the Year \u2013 said there were questions around the actions of Interpol and perhaps Australia\u2019s home affairs department. \u201cI\u2019m very hopeful justice will prevail in this case.\u201d Bahrain has until 8 February to lodge its extradition documentation or request an extension, otherwise Al-Araibi can be freed. Thailand, which is not a signatory to the UN refugees convention, has so far resisted international pressure to release Al-Araibi back to Australia.",

(The pose represents \u201crebirth and innocence in Christ\u201d, the priest claims.) He has an alibi and isn\u2019t a suspect, for now. The detectives also find out that Lucy told the priest she had a mystery aunt; the dolls were made by Patty Faber, \u201ca good woman\u201d, apparently, and that Hays used to be an altar boy (West was a Baptist). West and Hays visit Faber, who tells them a black man with a dead eye bought 10 dolls from her at a fair. He told her they were for his nieces and nephews. She couldn\u2019t remember any other details but assumed he lived across the tracks \u201cwhere the rest of them live\u201d, near Davis Junction. It\u2019s another not so subtle nod to the racism that Hays faces on the job.</p> <p>In 1990, Hays comes home to tell Amelia about his successful meeting with West, who has offered him a spot on his task force. We know this doesn\u2019t work out in the end, but he is beaming at the prospect of doing proper police work again. Amelia is still annoyed about Hays\u2019s reaction to her book. She dresses him down and tells him he needs to take responsibility for his actions. It\u2019s a pretty abrasive exchange in which neither comes out looking any better. Are the cracks in their relationship ravines? Was Hays\u2019s vision from the last episode a harbinger of something darker around the corner?</p> <p>Back in 1980, Hays and West are crossing the tracks to Davis Junction. They\u2019re hunting this one-eyed doll buyer, but are not getting much help. The liquor store manager eventually sends them in the direction of a Sam Whitehead at a trailer park where a couple of cops \u2013 especially featuring a white one \u2013 are unwelcome. It all kicks off when West starts to question Whitehead, so they duck into his trailer to avoid an escalation. Whitehead tells them he was at the park on the night of the seventh and that he works at the Hoyt chicken plant, as well as hauling freight and trapping. The crowd outside Whitehead\u2019s trailer chuck a rock through the duo\u2019s cop car and they leave, tails between legs.</p> <h2>\u201cI didn\u2019t see no one-eyed brother\u201d</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b9762c331202d10a650ba6a287e62c15145494c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b9762c331202d10a650ba6a287e62c15145494c/0_194_3900_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hays (right) with his son Henry, played by Ray Fisher.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two can sleuth \u2026 Hays (right) with his son Henry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2015, Hays visits his son, who is now a detective himself. He wants him to look up some people, including Roland West, to help with his own \u201cinvestigation\u201d. Reworking the case is his way of staying alive, he says. Henry reluctantly agrees to help. In 1990, Hays has another meeting with West, who has climbed the greasy pole. The meeting\u2019s other guests are the major and the state\u2019s attorney general, who are warm as can be towards West but cold shoulder Hays, apparently for his \u2013 yet to be disclosed \u2013 outburst(s). West is firmly told that his task force needs to vindicate the original conviction. Hays is told that if he can toe the line he could find himself back on major crimes. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do any of that shit they just said?\u201d asks Hays. \u201cWasn\u2019t planning on it,\u201d retorts West. The old gang is back together \u2026 or is West setting Hays up as a fall guy? That pained glance he gave him behind his back suggested it.</p> <p>Ten years earlier, West and Hays are at a service presided over by the Catholic priest. They stalked the room as they did in the town hall meeting, scanning for suspicious congregants. \u201cI didn\u2019t see no one-eyed brother, but there\u2019s some serious ass up in here,\u201d says West, who uses the opportunity to come on to a pious churchgoer. Is this his road to Damascus moment? The priest is very keen to have Hays confess, but he\u2019s not game. The priest tells him he doesn\u2019t know any parishioners with dead eyes, and certainly not any black ones in segregated small-town Arkansas.</p> <p>Later that evening, Amelia and Hays have a dinner where she does some digging about the case and talks about her time in California. (\u201cI used to be something of a mess,\u201d she says before quaffing a gin and tonic.) Hays tells her that he found the place in the woods where Will died and that he thinks he and his sister were meeting someone. \u201cThere was almost an element of affection in it?\u201d asks Amelia, referring to the toys that were found close to where Will died. Hays isn\u2019t convinced. Meanwhile, West is at the Sawhorse dive bar where Tom Purcell has been getting drunk and disorderly. The bouncers filled Purcell in after he started a fight with the owner \u2013 Lucy Purcell works at the bar and Tom thought she was having sex with the owner. West offers him his couch, and their unlikely friendship begins.</p> <h2>\u2018I want to know the whole story\u201d</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3244a06160bf01baf07faed3426de7643762e56f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3244a06160bf01baf07faed3426de7643762e56f/0_84_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Greyeyes as Brett Woodard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ass whooper \u2026 Michael Greyeyes as Brett Woodard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hays pays a visit to the documentary maker, Elisa, who shows Hays the new evidence she\u2019s uncovered. The remains of Dan O\u2019Brien, the kids\u2019 uncle, have been found in a shallow grave somewhere in Missouri. She won\u2019t go further, but tells him that she isn\u2019t trying to lay the blame at his door. Back in 1980, Kent is on local radio putting fuel on the fire of the raging moral panic that\u2019s seizing the town. Hays and West are very unimpressed, but their mood changes when the FBI say it has a lead: there\u2019s a DNA match on the bike that Hays found and it\u2019s the \u201cBlack Sunday kid\u201d, Freddy Burns of the VW gang.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Woodard is spotted talking to some kids by the redneck who stomped him last episode. He calls the boys up to dish out a second round of ass whooping but things play out slightly differently this time. When they chase Woodard back to his house he sets up some anti-personnel mines around his property and whips out that bag of guns he got out last week. It\u2019s like Home Alone meets Predator.</p> <p>In 2015, Hays is having visions again. He\u2019s sitting in his study and is suddenly surrounded by North Vietnamese soldiers. \u201cI felt like I made all y\u2019all sick,\u201d he says to himself, speaking about his family rather than the platoon. \u201cLike I poisoned you.\u201d He mutters something about not wanting to be alive without Amelia, and that he wants to find West to tell him about O\u2019Brien. He spots a car outside. Is someone watching him? It look as if his dementia is really taking hold.</p> <p>We end with the interrogation of Freddy Burns in 1980, who tells the detectives that he stole Will\u2019s bike from him after he came up to Devil\u2019s Den while looking for his sister. Hays hits him with the prison rape threat and they let him stew. No one thinks he actually killed Will but they want the whole story. I have a funny feeling Freddy won\u2019t be able to give them that.</p> <h2>Notes and observations</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"525541e8d5b2bbb1e259f97a0b85a06b1da3612d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/525541e8d5b2bbb1e259f97a0b85a06b1da3612d/0_19_3900_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elisa (Sarah Gadon) with Hays.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elisa (Sarah Gadon) with Hays.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>There\u2019s a theory knocking around that Amelia is the killer and uses Hays to avoid capture.

(The pose represents \u201crebirth and innocence in Christ\u201d, the priest claims.) He has an alibi and isn\u2019t a suspect, for now. The detectives also find out that Lucy told the priest she had a mystery aunt; the dolls were made by Patty Faber, \u201ca good woman\u201d, apparently, and that Hays used to be an altar boy (West was a Baptist). West and Hays visit Faber, who tells them a black man with a dead eye bought 10 dolls from her at a fair. He told her they were for his nieces and nephews. She couldn\u2019t remember any other details but assumed he lived across the tracks \u201cwhere the rest of them live\u201d, near Davis Junction. It\u2019s another not so subtle nod to the racism that Hays faces on the job. In 1990, Hays comes home to tell Amelia about his successful meeting with West, who has offered him a spot on his task force. We know this doesn\u2019t work out in the end, but he is beaming at the prospect of doing proper police work again. Amelia is still annoyed about Hays\u2019s reaction to her book. She dresses him down and tells him he needs to take responsibility for his actions. It\u2019s a pretty abrasive exchange in which neither comes out looking any better. Are the cracks in their relationship ravines? Was Hays\u2019s vision from the last episode a harbinger of something darker around the corner? Back in 1980, Hays and West are crossing the tracks to Davis Junction. They\u2019re hunting this one-eyed doll buyer, but are not getting much help. The liquor store manager eventually sends them in the direction of a Sam Whitehead at a trailer park where a couple of cops \u2013 especially featuring a white one \u2013 are unwelcome. It all kicks off when West starts to question Whitehead, so they duck into his trailer to avoid an escalation. Whitehead tells them he was at the park on the night of the seventh and that he works at the Hoyt chicken plant, as well as hauling freight and trapping. The crowd outside Whitehead\u2019s trailer chuck a rock through the duo\u2019s cop car and they leave, tails between legs. \u201cI didn\u2019t see no one-eyed brother\u201d In 2015, Hays visits his son, who is now a detective himself. He wants him to look up some people, including Roland West, to help with his own \u201cinvestigation\u201d. Reworking the case is his way of staying alive, he says. Henry reluctantly agrees to help. In 1990, Hays has another meeting with West, who has climbed the greasy pole. The meeting\u2019s other guests are the major and the state\u2019s attorney general, who are warm as can be towards West but cold shoulder Hays, apparently for his \u2013 yet to be disclosed \u2013 outburst(s). West is firmly told that his task force needs to vindicate the original conviction. Hays is told that if he can toe the line he could find himself back on major crimes. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do any of that shit they just said?\u201d asks Hays. \u201cWasn\u2019t planning on it,\u201d retorts West. The old gang is back together \u2026 or is West setting Hays up as a fall guy? That pained glance he gave him behind his back suggested it. Ten years earlier, West and Hays are at a service presided over by the Catholic priest. They stalked the room as they did in the town hall meeting, scanning for suspicious congregants. \u201cI didn\u2019t see no one-eyed brother, but there\u2019s some serious ass up in here,\u201d says West, who uses the opportunity to come on to a pious churchgoer. Is this his road to Damascus moment? The priest is very keen to have Hays confess, but he\u2019s not game. The priest tells him he doesn\u2019t know any parishioners with dead eyes, and certainly not any black ones in segregated small-town Arkansas. Later that evening, Amelia and Hays have a dinner where she does some digging about the case and talks about her time in California. (\u201cI used to be something of a mess,\u201d she says before quaffing a gin and tonic.) Hays tells her that he found the place in the woods where Will died and that he thinks he and his sister were meeting someone. \u201cThere was almost an element of affection in it?\u201d asks Amelia, referring to the toys that were found close to where Will died. Hays isn\u2019t convinced. Meanwhile, West is at the Sawhorse dive bar where Tom Purcell has been getting drunk and disorderly. The bouncers filled Purcell in after he started a fight with the owner \u2013 Lucy Purcell works at the bar and Tom thought she was having sex with the owner. West offers him his couch, and their unlikely friendship begins. \u2018I want to know the whole story\u201d Hays pays a visit to the documentary maker, Elisa, who shows Hays the new evidence she\u2019s uncovered. The remains of Dan O\u2019Brien, the kids\u2019 uncle, have been found in a shallow grave somewhere in Missouri. She won\u2019t go further, but tells him that she isn\u2019t trying to lay the blame at his door. Back in 1980, Kent is on local radio putting fuel on the fire of the raging moral panic that\u2019s seizing the town. Hays and West are very unimpressed, but their mood changes when the FBI say it has a lead: there\u2019s a DNA match on the bike that Hays found and it\u2019s the \u201cBlack Sunday kid\u201d, Freddy Burns of the VW gang. Meanwhile, Woodard is spotted talking to some kids by the redneck who stomped him last episode. He calls the boys up to dish out a second round of ass whooping but things play out slightly differently this time. When they chase Woodard back to his house he sets up some anti-personnel mines around his property and whips out that bag of guns he got out last week. It\u2019s like Home Alone meets Predator. In 2015, Hays is having visions again. He\u2019s sitting in his study and is suddenly surrounded by North Vietnamese soldiers. \u201cI felt like I made all y\u2019all sick,\u201d he says to himself, speaking about his family rather than the platoon. \u201cLike I poisoned you.\u201d He mutters something about not wanting to be alive without Amelia, and that he wants to find West to tell him about O\u2019Brien. He spots a car outside. Is someone watching him? It look as if his dementia is really taking hold. We end with the interrogation of Freddy Burns in 1980, who tells the detectives that he stole Will\u2019s bike from him after he came up to Devil\u2019s Den while looking for his sister. Hays hits him with the prison rape threat and they let him stew. No one thinks he actually killed Will but they want the whole story. I have a funny feeling Freddy won\u2019t be able to give them that. Notes and observations There\u2019s a theory knocking around that Amelia is the killer and uses Hays to avoid capture. That scene where he pleads with her to stop \u201ctalking shit about him\u201d or \u201che\u2019ll start crying\u201d shows the vulnerability needed for him to be manipulated, possibly. Mr Whitehead\u2019s \u201ccome watch these nefarious men and what they\u2019re trying to do to me\u201d might be the most eloquent way of preventing a wrongful arrest that\u2019s ever been uttered. Did anyone else feel the scene in the car with Tom Purcell using the N-word feel laboured? Four episodes in, I think everyone gets that small-town Arkansas in the 80s could be very, very racist. Elisa says she is alone when Hays visits her in the hotel, but there\u2019s a ruffled bed and two empty wine glasses. Could Henry, who knew her first name, be the visitor? Who was Lucy shouting at on the phone when Amelia popped round to drop the kids\u2019 things off? Lucy admits to \u201crunning around on Tom\u201d, having \u201cthe soul of a whore\u201d and to treating the children very poorly. Did anyone spot the white man hidden among the Vietnamese soldiers in Hays\u2019s vision?",

For decades she has edited the most influential fashion magazine in the world. She exists then at the top of a hierarchy. It is a very human instinct to want to establish a hierarchy and create order. If you want to find out how good you are, you need to find a representation of perfection upon which to measure yourself.

      "bodyText": "It was 20 December when I received an invitation out of the blue. Would I like to attend lunch with Anna Wintour? If so please save the date and a formal invitation will follow. After the bewilderment (why me?) came joy (lunch! With Anna Wintour! At the tennis!). Then came the anxiety. What would I wear? I had nothing to wear! What the fuck would I wear? Wintour, editor-in-chief of Vogue, has passed into legend. She has been mythologised in books and movies, had an award-winning documentary made about her (The September Issue), and has more influence on what we wear on a daily basis than anyone else. As the lunch drew nearer, questions about what to wear overcame any thoughts of the event itself. Or even the woman herself. I didn\u2019t know if there would be a small selection of guests or large. I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d be actually talking to Wintour or was expected to interview her. I didn\u2019t know how I was going to get there (the lunch was in Melbourne, I was in Sydney) or even why I was invited. She doesn\u2019t like all black, counselled one friend. She hates clothes to be wrinkled, so you have to wear something freshly ironed, said another. At the hairdresser, the woman at the next basin, who had once been in the same room as Wintour (an experience she described as \u201cterrifying\u201d) advised sotto voce to \u201cWear sunglasses. Everyone around her wears sunglasses.\u201d Others suggested I just wear the most fashionable thing I own. Fair enough, but the most on-trend piece in my wardrobe is the Big Puffer and it was going to be 41C in heatwave-afflicted Melbourne. Apart from an upcoming court appearance (another wardrobe dilemma!), what I would wear was the thing I thought about most frequently, and also caused me the most stress in the weeks between 20 December and 24 January. When it comes to Anna Wintour, there exists a warped relationship between her and the public. It is not about what she is wearing (as it would be with normal celebrities), but what am I wearing when I am seeing her (her, the ultimate global arbiter of what we all wear). An invitation to lunch with her then becomes mostly an experience to be disseminated through the following lens: what did you wear when you went to lunch with Anna Wintour? The experience with Wintour has already been related to your friends perhaps weeks before the event itself. You might have Instagrammed a selfie wearing the chosen outfit before you have even gone to the lunch. It is over before it has even begun. The encounter is complete without in the conventional sense, ever having occurred. Wintour has gone beyond the usual questions you get when you meet a celebrity of \u201cwhat is she like?\u201d to the more meta \u201cwhat are you like (or \u2018how do you present\u2019) when you are in a room with her\u201d. She (the abstract she, because she is not real or human in this exchange) becomes a story that you tell others about yourself. The story is what you wore the day you had lunch with Anna Wintour. The mirror that she provides helps create and possibly endorse your identity (an identity that speaks through clothes). Zadie Smith did a very good essay on Justin Bieber about how he is denied personhood because he is the object of such intense projection among fans. \u201cNot only is this meeting always already a story, it only really exists as narrative \u2026 it\u2019s obvious that a [fan\u2019s] only relation with the globally famous Bieber is as a piece of narrative to be told and retold to herself and other people and that Bieber himself, in his human reality, is barely involved, almost unnecessary,\u201d writes Smith in Feeling Free. This is the problem not just with meeting famous people, but people who exist in our imagination in a state of perfection. Wintour\u2019s state of perfection is in the area of clothes. For decades she has edited the most influential fashion magazine in the world. She exists then at the top of a hierarchy. It is a very human instinct to want to establish a hierarchy and create order. If you want to find out how good you are, you need to find a representation of perfection upon which to measure yourself. Wintour through the pop culture myth that surrounds her, and the fact that she edits Vogue, is the collective symbol of sartorial perfection. So the lunch came around and I walked in, still not sure what to expect. There was a giant screen with Wintour\u2019s face on it and at least 400 people in the function room, drinking green juice or champagne or ordering flat whites from the coffee station or talking selfies on a small piece of red carpet in front of an Australian Open trademarked backdrop. We were all having lunch with Anna Wintour. Yet none of us were. My relief at the lack of intimacy was immense. You see, I was unhappy with my outfit and I did not want to be seen. The day was filthy hot and most people there were dressed neatly, the men in nondescript light suits, the women in cotton or linen sundresses. No one \u2013 literally no one \u2013 not Baz Luhrmann, not Julie Bishop, looked as if they\u2019d stepped off the catwalk. People looked off-the-rack normal, unmemorable, fine. But yet, somewhere, even in this clothes-limiting heat, Wintour does actually serve her totemic purpose. She showed me who I am through the clothes that I ended up wearing. I did not have access to 90% of my clothes (I was on the road) and I didn\u2019t have a lot of time or money, so I bought something tasteful but boring at the airport as I flew into Melbourne. We find out who we are under moments of stress and panic. We find out who we are when we dress for lunch with Anna Wintour. I found out this week I am a generic, mid-priced brand in an airport, that markets office clothes for women aged age 20 to 55. Brigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia columnist.",

New Zealand house prices are among the most unaffordable in the world, with Auckland the seventh most expensive city to buy a home, and all three major cities considered \u201cseverely unaffordable\u201d by the latest Demographia international housing affordability survey. In 2018 the Labour coalition government banned the sale of existing New Zealand homes to overseas buyers and launched its flagship KiwiBuild scheme; aiming to build 100,000 affordable homes in 10 years, with 1,000 of them scheduled for the first year. But since July just 47 KiwiBuild homes have been completed \u2013 and housing minister Phil Twyford has said the government is unlikely to reach its target of 1,000 by June 2019 \u2013 putting the success of the project in jeopardy. Last week the chief executive of KiwiBuild resigned following an employment dispute, in another blow for the scheme. \u201cThese homes are coming but unfortunately we are not able to build as many in the first year as we hoped,\u201d Twyford told the Guardian. Twyford said it had been difficult to attract private developers to build smaller, more affordable homes, when they had previously focused on large and expensive construction projects. Economist Shamubeel Eaqub agreed, saying the government should switch its attention to building rental properties instead. Euqab said despite the urgency of the problem the government appeared to lack \u201cambition\u201d in dealing with the severe lack of affordable housing. \u201cThere is never a market for poor people, it is not profitable to build houses for poor people. That\u2019s the challenge,\u201d said Euqab. Alain Bertaud, a former World Bank principal urban planner, said that despite New Zealand being an otherwise \u201cexceptionally well-managed country\u201d its housing market was in a state of crisis. He said the government\u2019s efforts were being closely watched because they were broadly following global best practice in improving housing affordability. The government\u2019s measures would \u201ctake time\u201d to implement and take effect, Bertaud said. \u201cAfter the government has successfully passed these reforms, the international community will watch with great interest the impact it will have on Auckland \u2026 in the next few years,\u201d Bertaud said in the report. Many of the KiwiBuild homes already completed are languishing on the market, with many considering NZ$525,000 (\u00a3273,000) for a two-bedroom home far from affordable. In Auckland and Queenstown \u2013 the two most expensive cities in New Zealand \u2013 KiwiBuild houses are capped at NZ$500,00 for a one-bedroom home, NZ$600,000 for a two-bed, and NZ$650,000 for three bedrooms or more. The authors of the Demographia International Housing Affordability survey class a house as affordable if the median price is up to three times the median wage \u2013 making the government\u2019s KiwiBuild houses \u201cseverely unaffordable\u201d for most. On Trade Me, New Zealand\u2019s largest online auction website, some private home sales were being advertised as \u201ccheaper than a KiwiBuild\u201d and \u201cmuch more affordable than KiwiBuild\u201d. The oppositions spokesperson for housing, Judith Collins, said it appeared that Kiwis didn\u2019t want a KiwiBuild home, and the project was a failure. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly embarrassing for the minister, who not only can\u2019t reach his much-plugged target of 1,000 KiwiBuild homes, but the houses he has built are clearly not what first home buyers want,\u201d said Collins. \u201cThe minister\u2019s blatant disregard for detail has been shown time and time again, and now he\u2019s putting hardworking taxpayer money at risk because of it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The opposition leader who last week declared himself Venezuela\u2019s rightful interim president has played down fears of a possible armed conflict and claimed his economically devastated nation was living through an \u201calmost magical moment\u201d in its newly revived quest for democracy. In one of his first interviews since last Wednesday\u2019s surprise move, Juan Guaid\u00f3 told the Guardian he was set on \u201cgetting the job done\u201d to force Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power and ending a humanitarian emergency which has fuelled the largest exodus in modern Latin American history. Guaid\u00f3 said a combination of international backing, opposition unity and a reinvigorated grassroots support meant Venezuela now had a unique chance \u201cto leave the chaos behind\u201d. He also announced on Sunday that he will step up his push for power by holding rallies on Wednesday and another on Saturday, when the ultimatum from leading European countries is set to expire. \u201cFrustration has turned to hope. People are daring to dream again \u2026 we have awoken from a nightmare to have new dreams, to dream of the future, to dream of our country, [to dream] not of what we were, but of what we can become,\u201d said the 35-year-old politician. For all the optimism, questions have been raised about the bedfellows Guaid\u00f3 has chosen in what he calls his bid to rescue Venezuela. His main international backer is Donald Trump, who on Friday named a neoconservative, notorious for helping organise the covert financing of Contra rebels in Nicaragua, as his special envoy to Venezuela. Another key regional supporter is Brazil\u2019s far-right firebrand president, Jair Bolsonaro, known for his hostility to human rights and his fondness for dictatorship. A little-known opposition lawmaker until the start of this year, Guaid\u00f3 has been thrust into the eye of a growing domestic and geopolitical storm by his decision to declare himself Venezuela\u2019s legitimate interim president last Wednesday. He based that claim on Maduro\u2019s alleged \u201cusurpation\u201d of power through last year\u2019s election and an article of Venezuela\u2019s constitution he argues permits him to claim temporary leadership if the presidency is left \u201cvacant\u201d. That unprecedented challenge to Maduro \u2013 who was first elected after the 2013 death of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and re-elected last May in a vote widely seen as fraudulent \u2013 was endorsed by a succession of governments including those of the United States, Brazil, Canada and Colombia, although China and Russia continue to back Maduro. On Sunday White House national security adviser John Bolton warned against violence or intimidation of American diplomats in Venezuela or opposition leader Juan Guiad\u00f3, saying such action would trigger a response from the United States. \u201cAny violence and intimidation against US diplomatic personnel, Venezuela\u2019s democratic leader, Juan Guiado [sic], or the National Assembly itself would represent a grave assault on the rule of law and will be met with a significant response,\u201d Bolton said in a Twitter post on Sunday, also blaming Cuba for supporting Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro\u2019s paramilitary forces. Britain, France, Germany and Spain say they will recognise Guaid\u00f3 as interim president unless fresh elections are called within eight days, with the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, on Saturday calling for \u201ca new start for the suffering [people] of Venezuela\u201d. In an interview with CNN T\u00fcrk on Sunday, Maduro rejected those demands: \u201cNo one can give us an ultimatum \u2026 Venezuela is not tied to Europe. This is complete insolence.\u201d In an apparent attempt to project indifference to Venezuela\u2019s latest political convulsion, Maduro also tweeted a video of himself dancing to regional joropo music with the first lady, Cilia Flores. \u201cNothing can stop us!\u201d he wrote. Guaid\u00f3 admitted that while international support was growing, his movement to unseat Maduro still lacked crucial backing from Venezuela\u2019s military. Last week Venezuela\u2019s defence minister slammed what he called Guaid\u00f3\u2019s shameful \u201ccriminal plan\u201d to destabilise Venezuela and pledged loyalty to Maduro. The opposition leader pointed to the defection of Venezuela\u2019s top military envoy to the US on Saturday and the discharge of 3,600 military officials since last year as proof support was \u201cemerging\u201d within the armed forces. \u201cBut we have yet to consolidate these [gains] in order for us to really be able to execute the process that will lead us to a transitional government and, ultimately, to fresh elections,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 conceded. Some observers worry the intensifying political crisis has the potential to spark a civil war, if different military factions back different leaders. \u201cI am worried about a country that can fragment under different chieftains and warlords and generals and narco-traffickers [and guerrilla groups] and \u2026 Venezuela becoming like a tapestry of different power centres,\u201d the country\u2019s former trade minister, Mois\u00e9s Na\u00edm, told the Guardian last week. But Guaid\u00f3 tried to soothe fears of conflict. \u201cI don\u2019t think we will reach that point. The idea is to increase pressure,\u201d he said. Fresh anti-Maduro demonstrations have been called for this week and Guaid\u00f3 said he hoped marchers would not be met with deadly repression, as happened during the last major round of demonstrations in 2017. \u201cThis is no time for more deaths or more sacrifices.\u201d Human rights groups report that at least 26 people have been killed since the latest phase of protests began last week. Guaid\u00f3 said he felt confident about the future and urged Venezuelans to trust the country was turning a corner. \u201cThere are risks \u2026 but there will be bigger rewards. \u201cEverywhere I turn I get a smile \u2026 we all know that the situation is dire but regardless of this I have received encouragement. It\u2019s been great to see a newfound hope,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting calls from childhood friends who left the country and who tell me they finally have hope that they will return, and they tell me they will use everything they have learned living abroad to rebuild the country.\u201d However, concerns over Guaid\u00f3\u2019s international backers \u2013 particularly in Brazil and the US \u2013 remain. Following Bolsonaro\u2019s election last October, Guaid\u00f3, a member of the centrist Voluntad Popular party, praised what he called Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201ccommitment to and for democracy [and] human rights\u201d. Latin America specialist Miguel Tinker Salas said it was \u201castounding\u201d to see Bolsonaro and Trump painting themselves as advocates of \u201cdemocracy and fair play in Venezuela\u201d. \u201cThe US has no moral standing on these issues and neither does Bolsonaro and Brazil,\u201d said Salas, a signatory of an open letter attacking what it branded a US attempt to topple Maduro. Guaid\u00f3, who rejects claims that he is a pawn in a US-backed coup attempt, said his immediate priority \u2013 apart from securing a peaceful political transition \u2013 was addressing Venezuela\u2019s humanitarian crisis: \u201cOur focus is helping people.\u201d Another prime concern was rescuing Venezuela\u2019s once-great oil giant, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which oversees the world\u2019s biggest crude reserves but whose production has collapsed under Maduro. \u201cPDVSA is in a state of emergency,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 said. Once \u201cthe usurper\u201d (Maduro) was gone, Guaid\u00f3 said free elections needed to be held \u201cas soon as possible\u201d after political prisoners had been freed and members of Venezuela\u2019s swelling diaspora could all be registered. \u201cThat takes time but we need to take care of these [things] in the shortest period of time,\u201d he said.",

That is because \u201cnone of the identified forms of misconduct is a major contributor to high consumer prices\u201d, it said. The Grattan Institute cited the ACCC\u2019s finding that its proposed power price fixes could lower prices by 20-25% but savings attributable to the new law would be in the order of $33 to $58 per year, or 2.3 to 3.4% per residential consumer. The Grattan Institute said the government had failed to produce evidence of retailers engaging in \u201cmarket misconduct\u201d. \u201cNor has it explained why, if the concern is justified, it would not apply more broadly to sectors such as banking, petrol and supermarkets,\u201d it said. In December energy companies warned the bill may not be constitutional and Liberal MPs raised concerns internally that it is too great an intervention in free markets. The government agreed to water the bill down by giving courts \u2013 not the energy minister \u2013 the power to break up companies, and stipulating that a recommendation from the competition watchdog would be required. In the final sitting week of parliament the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, appeared to secure enough crossbench MPs\u2019 votes to pass the bill, but a procedural delay prevented the bill passing the lower house. The Coalition will have only a few sitting weeks to get it through both the house and Senate, where Centre Alliance may amend the divestiture powers to widen their reach to the grocery duopoly of Coles and Woolworths. The Greens also plan to amend the legislation to rule out use of public funds for new coal-fired power stations, a plan that was supported by Labor when proposed in a separate bill. The move is designed to thwart the Coalition using its electricity underwriting scheme to support new coal power stations. A $6bn plan by power baron Trevor St Baker has proposed accessing the scheme to build two new coal power plants in Victoria and New South Wales.",

      "body": "<p>That Barnsley has been found to be so harshly affected by a near-decade of austerity cuts comes as no surprise to Susan Round, 61, owner of the Pats for Pants underwear stall in the town centre\u2019s covered markets. \u201cI do think it has got worse. The state of the roads. Social care. The hospitals. Antisocial behaviour. Spice.\u201d</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.centreforcities.org/\">Centre for Cities</a> thinktank, Barnsley council spending has reduced by 40% over eight years \u2013 around four times the average reduction faced by cities in the south-east \u2013 since the coalition decided in 2010 that local government would bear the brunt of austerity and the poorest boroughs would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/09/territorial-injustice-on-rise-england-due-to-council-cuts-study\">shoulder the biggest cuts</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/28/deprived-northern-regions-worst-hit-by-uk-austerity-study-finds\">Deprived northern regions worst hit by UK austerity, study finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Roughly \u00a3145m has been stripped from the deprived South Yorkshire borough\u2019s annual spending, equivalent to \u00a3688 for every resident. About 2,400 jobs have gone and services are being tightly squeezed and chopped. Nationally, no councils have escaped cuts but working-class northern communities such as Barnsley have had it worse than others.</p> <p>On the Weigh and Save market stall, amid barrels of cereals and dried fruits, Tim Steele, 30, has experienced the cuts. He used to work with vulnerable families in a local Sure Start centre but lost his job when budgets were cut. He wonders what happened to those families. \u201cThe need is still there but there is nothing for them.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s changed? He sees more homeless people on the streets. \u201cA few years ago you never saw that,\u201d he said. Antisocial behaviour is more noticeable, the police are less visible and it is almost not worth bothering with the GP because appointments have to be booked weeks in advance, he added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63dbfbd2b81ec708687935422320b8e7b9e660ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63dbfbd2b81ec708687935422320b8e7b9e660ab/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Steele serves a customer at his Weigh and Save market stall in Barnsley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Steele serves a customer at his Weigh and Save market stall in Barnsley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Times are hard, said Steele. Lots of people struggle to pay the bills and there\u2019s an urgent sense that the cuts have gone too far. \u201cWe all pay our taxes and we need to see that tax go somewhere. The NHS needs it, the police needs it, the council needs it.\u201d</p> <p>In Barnsley town hall, council leader Sir Stephen Houghton laughs grimly when the prime minister, Theresa May\u2019s, pledge last year to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/03/theresa-may-conference-speech-ambasts-labour-as-she-calls-for-tory-unity\">end austerit</a>y, is mentioned. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost half our workforce. The council is basically run on the goodwill of the remaining staff. Volunteers help clean the streets. We are reaching the limit now.\u201d</p> <p>Two-thirds of the street cleaning budget has gone, along with a quarter of library spending and 100% of the tourism budget. Youth clubs and Sure Start centres have closed and grass verges go uncut. Services are often slower: \u201cIf you reported fly-tipping you used to expect it to be sorted in 24 hours; now you wait two weeks.\u201d</p> <p>On the other hand, Barnsley spends more on social care, up 2o percentage points since 2010. Strikingly, 62% of the entire council budget goes on looking after vulnerable adults and children \u2013 the biggest of any of the areas looked into by the thinktank. Demand is rising as the population gets older and child poverty rates, which are as high as 40% in some wards, rise.</p> <p>The rise is unsustainable, said Houghton. The fear is that the council will be forced to shut down everything else it does to meets its legal obligations to deliver social care. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to cut the grass, clean the streets or mend the roads. But really, who would want to live in a place where you don\u2019t do those things?\u201d said Houghton.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d243f9d0c6beb6485bd8d49106932e458d2c070\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d243f9d0c6beb6485bd8d49106932e458d2c070/0_166_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jane Holliday working with older people in Barnsley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jane Holliday, far left, works with vulnerable older people in her role as chief executive of Age UK Barnsley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jane Holliday, the chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.ageuk.org.uk/barnsley/\">Age UK Barnsley</a>, said the steep rise in adult social care spending reflects soaring demand, rather than evidence of a lush panoply of service provision. Care is tightly rationed, the quality often poor. Hurried care visits leave no time for a chat or a cup of tea with lonely clients. Some frail older people who don\u2019t qualify for council help struggle with cleaning, shopping or gardening.</p> <p>A few years ago, the council ran a free handyman service and a shopping service for older residents who needed a bit of support with everyday chores. These have been cut, said Holliday, and for those without family nearby the effect can be isolating. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people who have been sat in the dark for a couple of days because the fuse blew and they couldn\u2019t fix it.\u201d</p> <p>The once-thriving coal mining community is now England\u2019s 39th <a href=\"https://www.barnsley.gov.uk/media/9269/our-borough-profile-2018.pdf\">most deprived authority</a>. Levels of unemployment and economic inactivity are higher than the national average. Life expectancy is lower than the England average and <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/excesswintermortalityinenglandandwalesreferencetables\">winter death rates</a> from flu and respiratory disease are higher than average. The council believes this is partly the result of entrenched poverty and ill-health.</p> <p>Barnsley Foodbank Partnership, which did not exist five years ago, now runs 11 outlets. Ironically, it gave out fewer food parcels last year, not because there was less hardship but because a community project in one of the borough\u2019s poorest wards \u2013 one of its main referral agencies \u2013 was closed down. That austerity cut meant there was no one to refer hungry people for a food voucher. \u201cWe are clear there\u2019s been no reduction in need,\u201d said food bank chair Mick Neal.</p> <p>Dan Jarvis, the Labour MP for Barnsley central, said the human impact of years of government cuts to council services, alongside cuts to welfare benefits such as the bedroom tax and universal credit, has been an accumulation of stress and misery for local people. \u201cLife for my constituents, in work or out of work, has become harder. I see a lot of desperation and despair.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d70c27cad9dd1ccc91d9119361abf03f48b8d4ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d70c27cad9dd1ccc91d9119361abf03f48b8d4ec/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dave Wilson on his fruit and veg stall in Barnsley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dave Wilson, who runs the Dave &amp; Dave fruit and veg stall at Barnsley\u2019s indoor market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is little faith that the government public spending review later this year will herald good news. Ministers don\u2019t recognise that deprived areas have higher social spending requirements, said Houghton. He fears that areas such as Barnsley, where social need is highest but the ability to fund services locally weakest, will lose out further. \u201cIf you ran the NHS on that basis there would be rioting.\u201d</p> <p>For all the gloom, back in the town markets, there\u2019s a proud resilience. The town is used to hard knocks. Round is optimistic about the council\u2019s \u00a3180m regeneration scheme, which has revamped the legendary market and will bring a cinema. \u201cBarnsley is what it is,\u201d she said. \u201cIt declined, but it is coming back a heck of a lot.\u201d</p> <p>A few stalls away, Dave Wilson, 63, who runs Dave &amp; Dave fruit and veg, agrees. He thinks that Yorkshire comes off worst in the north-south economic divide, and says the NHS is struggling. But he\u2019s philosophical: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be optimistic.

      "bodyText": "That Barnsley has been found to be so harshly affected by a near-decade of austerity cuts comes as no surprise to Susan Round, 61, owner of the Pats for Pants underwear stall in the town centre\u2019s covered markets. \u201cI do think it has got worse. The state of the roads. Social care. The hospitals. Antisocial behaviour. Spice.\u201d According to the Centre for Cities thinktank, Barnsley council spending has reduced by 40% over eight years \u2013 around four times the average reduction faced by cities in the south-east \u2013 since the coalition decided in 2010 that local government would bear the brunt of austerity and the poorest boroughs would shoulder the biggest cuts. Roughly \u00a3145m has been stripped from the deprived South Yorkshire borough\u2019s annual spending, equivalent to \u00a3688 for every resident. About 2,400 jobs have gone and services are being tightly squeezed and chopped. Nationally, no councils have escaped cuts but working-class northern communities such as Barnsley have had it worse than others. On the Weigh and Save market stall, amid barrels of cereals and dried fruits, Tim Steele, 30, has experienced the cuts. He used to work with vulnerable families in a local Sure Start centre but lost his job when budgets were cut. He wonders what happened to those families. \u201cThe need is still there but there is nothing for them.\u201d What\u2019s changed? He sees more homeless people on the streets. \u201cA few years ago you never saw that,\u201d he said. Antisocial behaviour is more noticeable, the police are less visible and it is almost not worth bothering with the GP because appointments have to be booked weeks in advance, he added. Times are hard, said Steele. Lots of people struggle to pay the bills and there\u2019s an urgent sense that the cuts have gone too far. \u201cWe all pay our taxes and we need to see that tax go somewhere. The NHS needs it, the police needs it, the council needs it.\u201d In Barnsley town hall, council leader Sir Stephen Houghton laughs grimly when the prime minister, Theresa May\u2019s, pledge last year to end austerity, is mentioned. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost half our workforce. The council is basically run on the goodwill of the remaining staff. Volunteers help clean the streets. We are reaching the limit now.\u201d Two-thirds of the street cleaning budget has gone, along with a quarter of library spending and 100% of the tourism budget. Youth clubs and Sure Start centres have closed and grass verges go uncut. Services are often slower: \u201cIf you reported fly-tipping you used to expect it to be sorted in 24 hours; now you wait two weeks.\u201d On the other hand, Barnsley spends more on social care, up 2o percentage points since 2010. Strikingly, 62% of the entire council budget goes on looking after vulnerable adults and children \u2013 the biggest of any of the areas looked into by the thinktank. Demand is rising as the population gets older and child poverty rates, which are as high as 40% in some wards, rise. The rise is unsustainable, said Houghton. The fear is that the council will be forced to shut down everything else it does to meets its legal obligations to deliver social care. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to cut the grass, clean the streets or mend the roads. But really, who would want to live in a place where you don\u2019t do those things?\u201d said Houghton. Jane Holliday, the chief executive of Age UK Barnsley, said the steep rise in adult social care spending reflects soaring demand, rather than evidence of a lush panoply of service provision. Care is tightly rationed, the quality often poor. Hurried care visits leave no time for a chat or a cup of tea with lonely clients. Some frail older people who don\u2019t qualify for council help struggle with cleaning, shopping or gardening. A few years ago, the council ran a free handyman service and a shopping service for older residents who needed a bit of support with everyday chores. These have been cut, said Holliday, and for those without family nearby the effect can be isolating. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people who have been sat in the dark for a couple of days because the fuse blew and they couldn\u2019t fix it.\u201d The once-thriving coal mining community is now England\u2019s 39th most deprived authority. Levels of unemployment and economic inactivity are higher than the national average. Life expectancy is lower than the England average and winter death rates from flu and respiratory disease are higher than average. The council believes this is partly the result of entrenched poverty and ill-health. Barnsley Foodbank Partnership, which did not exist five years ago, now runs 11 outlets. Ironically, it gave out fewer food parcels last year, not because there was less hardship but because a community project in one of the borough\u2019s poorest wards \u2013 one of its main referral agencies \u2013 was closed down. That austerity cut meant there was no one to refer hungry people for a food voucher. \u201cWe are clear there\u2019s been no reduction in need,\u201d said food bank chair Mick Neal. Dan Jarvis, the Labour MP for Barnsley central, said the human impact of years of government cuts to council services, alongside cuts to welfare benefits such as the bedroom tax and universal credit, has been an accumulation of stress and misery for local people. \u201cLife for my constituents, in work or out of work, has become harder. I see a lot of desperation and despair.\u201d There is little faith that the government public spending review later this year will herald good news. Ministers don\u2019t recognise that deprived areas have higher social spending requirements, said Houghton. He fears that areas such as Barnsley, where social need is highest but the ability to fund services locally weakest, will lose out further. \u201cIf you ran the NHS on that basis there would be rioting.\u201d For all the gloom, back in the town markets, there\u2019s a proud resilience. The town is used to hard knocks. Round is optimistic about the council\u2019s \u00a3180m regeneration scheme, which has revamped the legendary market and will bring a cinema. \u201cBarnsley is what it is,\u201d she said. \u201cIt declined, but it is coming back a heck of a lot.\u201d A few stalls away, Dave Wilson, 63, who runs Dave &amp; Dave fruit and veg, agrees. He thinks that Yorkshire comes off worst in the north-south economic divide, and says the NHS is struggling. But he\u2019s philosophical: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be optimistic. You can always lie down and die. But if you don\u2019t try, you don\u2019t get nought.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 7 February 2019. An earlier version referred to the town of Barnsley as a city. The research looked into cities, and included Barnsley; the definition used by the Centre for Cities thinktank encompassed neighbouring towns and villages in the metropolitan borough of Barnsley.",

      "bodyText": "Schools in England will no longer be punished for failing to meet the government\u2019s standards in national exams or tests, Damian Hinds will announce as part of a new strategy to attract and retain teachers in the profession. The proposals to be unveiled by the education secretary means schools will not be defined as failing or \u201ccoasting\u201d based on results of national tests or GCSE exams, removing a burden of assessment that has been criticised for unfairly hitting schools with challenging pupil intakes. Instead, only Ofsted inspection results are to be used in future as a trigger for intervention in schools such as a change in management \u2013 a decision welcomed by school leaders as removing the assessment double jeopardy that many faced. \u201cFloor and coasting standards added unnecessary stress and uncertainty without ever helping the process of school improvement. School leaders will be pleased to see the back of them,\u201d said Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, which has long campaigned against them. The move is part of a package designed to make teaching more attractive, including efforts to increase flexible working and job-sharing, announced by Hinds in the Guardian last week, while also cutting workload in areas such as marking, data collection and lesson planning. The new measures include an \u201cearly careers framework\u201d, designed to support newly qualified teachers at the beginning of their career, a time when a substantial number drop out of the profession. Under the framework, new teachers will receive a two-year package of training and support at the start of their career, including a reduced teaching timetable to continue their training. The Department for Education said the framework would be backed by \u00a3130m in annual funding when fully operational. \u201cThose who choose to become teachers choose to do so to inspire young people, support their development and set them up for a bright future \u2013 not stay late in the office filling in a spreadsheet,\u201d Hinds said. \u201cThis ambitious strategy commits to supporting teachers \u2013 particularly those at the start of their career \u2013 to focus on what actually matters, the pupils in their classrooms. \u201cIn a competitive graduate labour market, we must continue to ensure that teaching is an attractive profession so we can train and retain the next generation of inspirational teachers.\u201d But Angela Rayner, Labour\u2019s shadow education secretary, said the government\u2019s own policies had created the crisis, with record numbers of experienced teachers now leaving the profession. \u201cNothing in this strategy will reverse years of real-terms pay cuts and the huge cuts to school budgets that have made it impossible for schools to recruit the staff they need,\u201d Rayner said, reiterating Labour\u2019s pledge to reintroduce a national education service. The strategy includes some retention-based payments for those who remain past the early stages, with additional bursary payments throughout the first years of their career. The DfE said the priorities for the strategy had been decided in consultation with leading education unions, who had agreed to help schools implement the strategy. It comes as secondary schools in England have an urgent need to recruit and retain teachers. The number of secondary school pupils is forecast to rise by 15% during the next decade, according to the National Foundation for Educational Research, while the government has missed its recruitment targets for trainees over the last six years, especially in key subjects such as maths, modern foreign languages and physics. Carole Willis, the NFER\u2019s chief executive, said her organisation fully supported the new policies, especially the efforts to improve retention. \u201cWe would just issue a note of caution,\u201d she said. \u201cIs the pace of implementation proposed fast enough to deliver what is needed as pupil numbers in secondary schools continue to rise, and will sufficient funding be made available for delivery of the proposals outlined? \u201cIt is clear we need to encourage more teachers to stay, and offer those who have left teaching the prospect of an exciting, rewarding and manageable career that they want to return to.\u201d",
