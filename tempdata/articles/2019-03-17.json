      "bodyText": "The collapse of Interserve (Report, 16 March), a private probation provider, is both predictable and vexatious. We are all former probation officers turned academics who have over many years individually and collectively opposed the dismantling and part-privatisation of probation in England and Wales by administrations of all parties. Following fundamental criticisms by the National Audit Office and the Probation Inspectorate, and the total failure of the contract holder for the whole of Wales and the west of England, we write to call for rational and positive reform of probation. Shackled to a failing coalition with prisons, the service cannot fulfil its historic function as a non-punitive, community-based alternative. Probation must be set free to reconstitute itself as a national public service that makes communities safer by helping people become better citizens; honours its traditional values of respect and unsentimental optimism; and uses evidence-based methods to reduce reoffending. Such changes require a level of political will, courage, vision and competence hitherto lacking in those responsible for what has been a policy disaster.

The collapse of the two government outsourcers little more than a year apart has put the debate over corporate governance in Britain back on the agenda \u2013 with reform of the audit industry front and centre.

The accountancy regulator \u2013 the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) \u2013 appeared to be either underpowered or asleep at the wheel. In a seemingly happy coincidence for the government, ministers announced last week, just days before Interserve filed for administration, that the FRC was to be abolished. It will be replaced with the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority (Arga), a statutory body, with some new powers. The FRC chair, Win Bischoff, will resign as soon as a replacement is found.
