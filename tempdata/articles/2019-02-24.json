Around two billion moths are estimated to make the journey.</p> <p>The ecologist Dr Ken Green has been monitoring bogong moths for 40 years. He said: \u201cLast summer numbers were atrocious. It was not just really bad, it was the worst I had ever seen. Now this year it\u2019s got even worse.\u201d</p> <p>The moths find caves and cracks in boulders to hide away in a torpor state. A cave at Mount Gingera, near Canberra, has been known to house millions of the moths but last month Green and colleagues counted just three individuals. Searches of about 50 known sites have turned up similar catastrophic absences.</p> <p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t just declined. They\u2019ve gone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have done mountains from down to the Victorian border all the way to Canberra. We have checked every cave we know.\u201d</p> <p>A site at South Ramshead in the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales had just 1,000 moths last year. \u201cThat is very, very low,\u201d says Green.</p> <p>\u201cThis year we found just six moths. Last week we went back and there were none.\u201d</p> <p>Green believes the cause of the crash is drought in the moth\u2019s breeding areas. The <a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/statements/scs66.pdf\">Bureau of Meteorology has said the drought was exceptional in those areas</a>, but noted there had been similar dry periods in the 1960s and earlier. </p> <h2>Impact on the endangered mountain pygmy possums</h2> <p>Dean Heinze, an associate at Latrobe University, has been monitoring and researching mountain pygmy possums since the early 1990s. The possum populations are spread across Kosciuszko national park in New South Wales, and in Victoria at Mount Bogong, Mount Higginbotham and Mount Buller.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c50813faa9feeda55dd1b1531de294b89bd6018\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c50813faa9feeda55dd1b1531de294b89bd6018/0_27_3425_2056/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scientists think the \u201castonishing\u201d drop in bogong moth numbers is linked to climate change, with extensive droughts in recent years in locations where the moths breed before migrating to alpine regions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scientists think the \u2018astonishing\u2019 drop in bogong moth numbers is linked to climate change, with extensive droughts in recent years in locations where the moths breed before migrating to alpine regions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Auscape International/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the possums emerge from hibernation in September and October, the moths are a key food source as they breed and raise young.</p> <p>\u201cBogong moths are an incredible food source and very high in protein. Last year we found that some populations of possums were losing litters. It\u2019s happening again this year. We think that the fewer moths means the possums are carrying less weight and losing the litters.\u201d</p> <p>In recent weeks Heinze has visited about 12 locations in Victoria and discovered dead litters in female pouches at \u201cmost of the sites.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a widespread event,\u201d he said. \u201cI inspect the reproductive system of the animal and I look in their pouch to see how many young there are. I have been opening pouches and discovering dead and decomposing young ... For some, the young have been dead for days.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/24/zoos-victoria-30m-plan-save-australian-species-extinction\">Zoos Victoria unveils $30m plan to save 20 Australian species from extinction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe concern is that over time, if this happens more frequently we will see declines in the adult population as well. And this is the second year that they have lost litters. The litmus test will be next season.\u201d</p> <p>Around Mount Buller in Victoria, the possum habitat is fragmented by ski resorts. Captive breeding and release programs have been used to keep numbers up.</p> <p>\u201cWe have put a huge effort into the population at Mount Buller,\u201d says Heinze. \u201cWe have brought the population back from the brink and now we have this happening. I\u2019m optimistic, but if we get more of this then it doesn\u2019t look good. Here we are dealing with a species that only occurs in the alps, but what\u2019s impacting it is happening hundreds of kilometres away.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, a <a href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/recovery-plans/mountain-pygmy-possum\">national recovery plan</a> was agreed for the possum, outlining multiple threats including habitat degradation, predation by invasive cats and foxes and climate change.</p> <p>A study <a href=\"http://www.publish.csiro.au/WR/fulltext/WR17186\">published in October 2018 and led by scientists at the New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage</a> looked at the climate change threats to the possums and the moths.

      "bodyText": "Numbers of unique Australian moths that migrate in their billions to alpine areas have crashed, ecologists say, putting extra pressure on the endangered mountain pygmy possum. Scientists believe the \u201castonishing\u201d drop in bogong moth numbers is linked to climate change and recent droughts in areas where the moths breed. At the same time checks on the endangered mountain pygmy possum, which exists only in Australia\u2019s alpine regions, have revealed dead litters in the pouches of females. The moths are a key food source for the possums as they wake from hibernation. In 2018, scientists revealed bogong moths were the only known insect to use the earth\u2019s magnetic field to help them navigate from grasslands in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland \u2013 sometimes at distances of 1,000km. Around two billion moths are estimated to make the journey. The ecologist Dr Ken Green has been monitoring bogong moths for 40 years. He said: \u201cLast summer numbers were atrocious. It was not just really bad, it was the worst I had ever seen. Now this year it\u2019s got even worse.\u201d The moths find caves and cracks in boulders to hide away in a torpor state. A cave at Mount Gingera, near Canberra, has been known to house millions of the moths but last month Green and colleagues counted just three individuals. Searches of about 50 known sites have turned up similar catastrophic absences. \u201cThey haven\u2019t just declined. They\u2019ve gone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have done mountains from down to the Victorian border all the way to Canberra. We have checked every cave we know.\u201d A site at South Ramshead in the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales had just 1,000 moths last year. \u201cThat is very, very low,\u201d says Green. \u201cThis year we found just six moths. Last week we went back and there were none.\u201d Green believes the cause of the crash is drought in the moth\u2019s breeding areas. The Bureau of Meteorology has said the drought was exceptional in those areas, but noted there had been similar dry periods in the 1960s and earlier. Impact on the endangered mountain pygmy possums Dean Heinze, an associate at Latrobe University, has been monitoring and researching mountain pygmy possums since the early 1990s. The possum populations are spread across Kosciuszko national park in New South Wales, and in Victoria at Mount Bogong, Mount Higginbotham and Mount Buller. As the possums emerge from hibernation in September and October, the moths are a key food source as they breed and raise young. \u201cBogong moths are an incredible food source and very high in protein. Last year we found that some populations of possums were losing litters. It\u2019s happening again this year. We think that the fewer moths means the possums are carrying less weight and losing the litters.\u201d In recent weeks Heinze has visited about 12 locations in Victoria and discovered dead litters in female pouches at \u201cmost of the sites.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a widespread event,\u201d he said. \u201cI inspect the reproductive system of the animal and I look in their pouch to see how many young there are. I have been opening pouches and discovering dead and decomposing young ... For some, the young have been dead for days. \u201cThe concern is that over time, if this happens more frequently we will see declines in the adult population as well. And this is the second year that they have lost litters. The litmus test will be next season.\u201d Around Mount Buller in Victoria, the possum habitat is fragmented by ski resorts. Captive breeding and release programs have been used to keep numbers up. \u201cWe have put a huge effort into the population at Mount Buller,\u201d says Heinze. \u201cWe have brought the population back from the brink and now we have this happening. I\u2019m optimistic, but if we get more of this then it doesn\u2019t look good. Here we are dealing with a species that only occurs in the alps, but what\u2019s impacting it is happening hundreds of kilometres away.\u201d In 2016, a national recovery plan was agreed for the possum, outlining multiple threats including habitat degradation, predation by invasive cats and foxes and climate change. A study published in October 2018 and led by scientists at the New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage looked at the climate change threats to the possums and the moths. The study suggested the moths had a \u201creduced survival in a warmer world\u201d and this would \u201clikely further affect survival\u201d of the possums. Prof Lesley Hughes, an ecologist at Macquarie University and councillor at the Climate Council of Australia, said the potential role of climate change in the decline of the moths and possums were what ecologists and climate scientists had predicted. \u201cUnfortunately the general predictions of the ecological risks of climate change are now turning into observations for particular species. And it should be no surprise we are seeing these impacts in the alpine zone, long recognised as one of the most vulnerable ecosystems to climate risks. \u201cSometimes these changes can appear to happen abruptly \u2013 one year there are millions of moths and the next almost none. This shows how particular extreme events, such as droughts or severe bushfires, can suddenly tip a species over the edge, with flow-on effects to others in the ecosystem.\u201d The environment minister, Melissa Price, said she was aware of the reports of low bogong moth numbers and the government was working with a leading possum researcher \u201cto understand the potential toll that reduced number of moths may be having on the species\u201d. The removal of feral cats and foxes in Kosciusko national park was helping possum protection, she said, and two government-backed projects were tackling weed infestations, building resilience to climate change, and managing loss of genetic diversity among possums in the Victorian Alpine region. Victoria\u2019s Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning spokesperson Adrian Moorrees said the reduction in moths \u201cis likely to be due to recent droughts\u201d in NSW and Queensland. He said tools and processes were being developed \u201cto better monitor and predict the impact of bogong moth populations on endangered mountain pygmy possums.\u201d A spokesperson for the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage said no litter deaths were reported in NSW possum populations, but the drought was believed to have impacted most species. He said when moth numbers were low, possums turned to other food sources, including insects, fruits and nectar, adding \u201cOEH will continue to implement the species recovery plans for the mountain pygmy possum.\u201d",

Personally, I can\u2019t wait to see if someone gets busy with their Mr Poop toilet plunger on the red carpet, or hands around tasty treats from their cannabis edibles gift box.</p> \n<p>\u2022We don\u2019t know yet what order they\u2019ll do the handouts, as there seems to be a great deal of fiddling about with the show. But they traditionally kick off with the best supporting actor gong, which a little while back looked nailed on for Mahershala Ali.

Hard to anticipate of course: we\u2019d expect nothing less than regal elegance if Glenn Close steps up, and Christian Bale looks unlikely to get another chance to invoke a Satanic hellstorm, but if Olivia Colman gets the gong, I think we\u2019re in for a treat.</p> \n<p>\u2022Hollywood seems to have got the memo that political posturing leads to aggravation from the TV audience and a visit from the online Maga crew, so there\u2019s not likely to be anything in the Marlon Brando/Vanessa Redgrave league.

We can but hope. \u2022The Oscars gift bag is always good for a laugh \u2013 just bear in mind these aren\u2019t official, just a bunch of self-promoting hucksters riding on the coat-tails of the big event. Personally, I can\u2019t wait to see if someone gets busy with their Mr Poop toilet plunger on the red carpet, or hands around tasty treats from their cannabis edibles gift box. \u2022We don\u2019t know yet what order they\u2019ll do the handouts, as there seems to be a great deal of fiddling about with the show. But they traditionally kick off with the best supporting actor gong, which a little while back looked nailed on for Mahershala Ali. But if Richard E Grant nabs it, it\u2019ll show the anti-Green Book faction is a power to be reckoned with, and that Grant\u2019s shameless pitching on social media. For the full list of nominations, look here. \u2022If we can be so bold, can we draw your attention to the fact that the Guardian itself is up for an Oscar tonight? Our film Black Sheep is up for best documentary short. You can watch it now, if you like. And if it wins, you\u2019ll be able to hear the hellish screams of delight emanating from Guardian HQ. \u2022The Academy managed to put everyone\u2019s backs up by trying to shove a few awards into the commercial breaks, drop most of the songs and \u2013 most insultingly of all \u2013 try and get rid of the no-names who only went and won last year. So if there\u2019s an extra big cheer for Alison Janney, or whoever wins best film editing, or whoever belts out that funny song from The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, you\u2019ll know why. \u2022Will anyone do a Gwyneth Paltrow and totally lose it on the podium? Hard to anticipate of course: we\u2019d expect nothing less than regal elegance if Glenn Close steps up, and Christian Bale looks unlikely to get another chance to invoke a Satanic hellstorm, but if Olivia Colman gets the gong, I think we\u2019re in for a treat. \u2022Hollywood seems to have got the memo that political posturing leads to aggravation from the TV audience and a visit from the online Maga crew, so there\u2019s not likely to be anything in the Marlon Brando/Vanessa Redgrave league. If anything does emerge, the most likely are barbed comments over the lack of female directors, a la Natalie Portman at last year\u2019s Golden Globes. \u2022And last but not least, Stuart Heritage will be conducting the now-traditional Oscars bingo on the live blog. Card below \u2013 and take it away Stuart! \u2022 This article was amended on 24 February to correct the date of the Oscars ceremony.",

They were underdogs at home, slowly and deliberately whipping the crowd into a frenzy, but they will be expected to win on 9 March. \u201cThe great thing about the Six Nations is that anyone can beat anyone on their day,\u201d Gatland said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want. You do not want England or France, as they did in the past, dominating. We want unpredictability, teams that cause upsets by being tactically astute. \u201cBeating England was an upset, not for us because we expected to win, but it would have been for a lot of people. \u201cIt sets us up nicely in World Cup year. We\u2019re the only unbeaten team left in the championship with the potential of winning the triple crown, the grand slam and the title. We have not secured any bonus points, which makes it a challenge, but to make it a record number of wins made it a special day for the players. \u201cOur second-half display was as good as it gets and maybe it will make people sit up and take notice of us.\u201d Gatland said before the start of the Six Nations he felt if Wales won in Paris on the opening night they would be well placed to win the title for the first time since 2013. The manner of England\u2019s win in Dublin turned the attention on to them, but that worked to Wales\u2019s advantage on Saturday when they disarmed England\u2019s bulky ball\u2011carriers and defused their kicking game. England led 10-3 at the interval but hardly fired a shot in the second half. \u201cIt would be special if we could sign off my final year in Wales with the Six Nations title,\u201d Gatland said. \u201cI was really proud of this performance. England said they were coming down to spoil our party and perhaps we have spoiled theirs. The sign of a good team, though, is to move on and start thinking about the next phase.\u201d When Wales have won their first three matches in the Six Nations, they have gone on to secure the grand slam, in 2005, 2008 and 2012. \u201cWe are in a great position, but we know that one slip-up means we don\u2019t win the championship,\u201d said the fly-half Dan Biggar, who came off the bench on the hour to steer his side to victory. \u201cWe have two tough games coming up and winning them would be a perfect send-off for Warren in the last year of his great reign. We are full of confidence after winning 12 on the bounce, but the World Cup is looming and we are conscious of not peaking too soon. \u201cWe were not at our absolute best against England, but found a way to win. Perhaps it was a bigger game for us because if they had won they would have gone on to win the championship comfortably and I was glad to make a contribution. Hunger took us over the line. Another victory, another step.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "England\u2019s hopes of winning the Six Nations took a further blow on Sunday night when Courtney Lawes was ruled out for the rest of the tournament. Lawes suffered a calf strain in England\u2019s 21-13 defeat by Wales on Saturday and is expected to be sidelined for at least four weeks. Lawes was among England\u2019s most impressive performers on Saturday but hobbled off in the closing stages as Wales came from 10-3 down at half-time to clinch a record 12th victory. Eddie Jones is hopeful Lawes\u2019s absence will be tempered by Maro Itoje\u2019s potential return to fitness with England still to face Italy and Scotland in the championship. Victory in both could still lead to England winning the title if Wales slip up in their final two matches. \u201c[Maro] is coming along well,\u201d said Jones. \u201cHe might be a chance [against Italy]. I might have to give him the hurry-up, because we\u2019ve potentially lost Courtney.\u201d Meanwhile England\u2019s players have admitted they failed to deal with Wales\u2019s wind-up tactics as their Six Nations grand slam hopes came to an end \u2013 but rejected Warren Gatland\u2019s stinging criticism that they are big-match chokers. Gatland claimed after his side\u2019s 21-13 win that the ploy to target Kyle Sinckler had paid off after the England tighthead prop was withdrawn before the hour, having given away two penalties in quick succession and been lectured by the referee, Jaco Peyper. Sinckler \u2013 described by Gatland as an emotional timebomb \u2013 excelled for the first 50 minutes but was drawn into an ongoing tussle with Alun Wyn Jones while the man of the match, Liam Williams, also clashed with Manu Tuilagi as Wales increasingly looked able to get under England\u2019s skin. \u201cThe biggest thing was them trying to take our mind off the game,\u201d the England No 8, Billy Vunipola, said. \u201cYou saw in the second half there was a lot more niggle and we bought into that because we thought we had a seven\u2011point buffer. That\u2019s where they grew and every time the game started to speed up one of their players would go down. They wanted us to play at their tempo and they did that really well. The disappointing thing for us is that we didn\u2019t fire a shot in the second half.\u201d Wales gave away three penalties but as the home team fought back from 10-3 down at half-time England\u2019s discipline got progressively worse, and they conceded six in the second half. Jamie George acknowledged Wales were more streetwise but denied Gatland\u2019s claim that \u201cwhen it\u2019s really mattered, I\u2019ve questioned whether they can win these big games\u201d. Jones refused to comment on Gatland\u2019s barb but George said: \u201cI think that\u2019s unfair. Warren can say what he likes. He is in a position of power after winning that game, so fair play to them. We have won big games before and we are going to win big games again. \u201cThey scrapped. You have got to give them respect and the credit they deserve. They certainly kept the pressure on and capitalised on field position we gave them through a lack of discipline.\u201d England have dropped to second in the Six Nations table but are two points behind Wales by virtue of bonus points against Ireland and France. Victories over Italy and Scotland would be enough to claim the title if Wales slip up. England will begin their preparations for the final block of fixtures by welcoming Georgia to their Oxford base for live training sessions this week. Jones will be without Dylan Hartley, who has knee surgery on Tuesday and will miss the rest of the championship. He is also waiting on the results of a scan on Courtney Lawes\u2019s injured calf while Jonny May went off on Saturday with a head injury. Lawes must be considered a doubt to face Italy, having hobbled off in the closing stages, but Jones is hopeful Maro Itoje will be fit following a knee injury. \u201cHe\u2019s coming along well,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe might be a chance [against Italy]. I might have to give him the hurry-up, because we\u2019ve potentially lost Courtney.\u201d Jones also called for Sinckler to be cut some slack after condemnation from supporters. \u201cTrying to single him out and try to make a villain of him will do him a disservice,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a very good young player and playing in one of the most difficult positions on the field, and he\u2019ll come through as a great Test player for England.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Oscars is such a huge moment but when it comes to styling my clients, it comes down to how best to create a story with clothes. The moment that the new year begins, my team and I begin planning every look I\u2019m going to try on during awards season. This year, we asked Michael B Jordan, Letitia Wright and Cynthia Erivo how they would like to feel and then I take it from there, utilising the knowledge I have of the runway to figure out the right pieces to fit.</p> <p>When it comes to diversity in the industry, I can honestly say I\u2019ve seen a change from when I first started as a Teen Vogue fashion assistant in 2010. You did not see a lot of people like me. It was very rare to see black stylists and black editors being celebrated by the masses and in high-level positions.</p> <p>At the beginning of my career I would receive a lot of \u201cnos\u201d when I asked to borrow a runway look for a client to wear on the red carpet and I would find myself pleading with PRs at fashion houses to loan designers\u2019 looks to me. It was unfortunately not standard to be aware of inclusivity of talents and new generation creatives until recent times.</p> <p>It was then that I began working closely \u2013 and still do \u2013 with newer designers such as Kim Shui, Victoria Hayes, Pyer Moss and LaQuan Smith who understand the importance of recognising and supporting talents of all races and backgrounds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BsUbTSDBxDg/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "The Oscars is such a huge moment but when it comes to styling my clients, it comes down to how best to create a story with clothes. The moment that the new year begins, my team and I begin planning every look I\u2019m going to try on during awards season. This year, we asked Michael B Jordan, Letitia Wright and Cynthia Erivo how they would like to feel and then I take it from there, utilising the knowledge I have of the runway to figure out the right pieces to fit. When it comes to diversity in the industry, I can honestly say I\u2019ve seen a change from when I first started as a Teen Vogue fashion assistant in 2010. You did not see a lot of people like me. It was very rare to see black stylists and black editors being celebrated by the masses and in high-level positions. At the beginning of my career I would receive a lot of \u201cnos\u201d when I asked to borrow a runway look for a client to wear on the red carpet and I would find myself pleading with PRs at fashion houses to loan designers\u2019 looks to me. It was unfortunately not standard to be aware of inclusivity of talents and new generation creatives until recent times. It was then that I began working closely \u2013 and still do \u2013 with newer designers such as Kim Shui, Victoria Hayes, Pyer Moss and LaQuan Smith who understand the importance of recognising and supporting talents of all races and backgrounds. In recent times, social media has really helped to increase awareness within the fashion industry, allowing for some of the greats who influenced me to be honoured for their contributions to style \u2013 people like Misa Hylton, June Ambrose, Patti Wilson and Wouri Vice. It has also helped shed light on some horrendous designer hiccups that have caused fury within the fashion community when discussing diversity and inclusion within major fashion ateliers. This has been an ongoing problem that I look forward to helping change.

But it was the remote frontier with Brazil that saw the worst violence and the boldest \u2013 though unfounded \u2013 claims of success in getting aid into Venezuela. At least three people were killed and more than 20 injured over two days of extraordinary violence and tension in the area that saw the regional military chief briefly captured by indigenous people and the most senior local official flee into hiding. \u201cI am protecting the mayor and indigenous leaders,\u201d Candy, a leader of the indigenous Pem\u00f3n Territorial Guard, told the Guardian. \u201cThis flight into the forest is isn\u2019t some kind of protest.

It is also increasingly dangerous on the Venezuelan side of the border, where illegal mining is expanding fast. Tensions have been building between the Pem\u00f3n, who under the Venezuelan constitution control the area as their territory, and a cash-strapped government keen to exploit rich mineral resources regardless of cost. During the standoff over opposition plans to bring aid into the area, those strains flared into bloodshed. The first violence came on Friday morning, when troops heading to the border killed a Pem\u00f3n woman, Zoraida Rodriguez, after pro-oppostion protesters tried to stop their convoy passing. Sixteen people were injured. Nine were taken to hospital in the Brazillian town of Boa Vista. Salomon Martinez, 40, a cartographer, travelled with them because several of his relatives were hit. Two were in serious condition, one on a breathing apparatus and a second in intensive care with gunshot wounds to his thorax and abdomen and injuries to his liver and intestine. \u201cWe want the world to know what is happening, that the blood of Venezuelan people is being spilled and the government is trying to hide it,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThey are killing the indigenous on their land.\u201d In the wake of that attack, villagers managed to disarm and detain four soldiers: Gen Jose Miguel Montoya, military chief of Bolivar state, his driver and bodyguard and a sergeant, Grecia Roque Castillo. \u201cMontoya said it was unconstitutional for us to hold him, and we asked him, \u2018Is it constitutional to open fire on the indigenous population?\u2019\u201d said state legislator Jorge Perez, who is from the community of Kumarakapay, where the incident happened. News of the violence filtered through to the border town of Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n, which along with the nearby small military base of Roraima would become the focus of another 24 hours of bloodshed. Demonstrators had been trying to close roads into the town since Friday night, to stop soldiers reaching the border. They failed, and the town was soon patrolled by national guard troops in armoured vehicles, who locals said shot at civilians on Saturday. The mayor of Gran Sabana, Emilio Gonzales, only the second Pem\u00f3n elected to the position, fled into hiding and then over the border to Brazil.

After a few hours parked a good distance from a menacing line of Venezuelan security forces, the trucks drove away without unloading. Brazil did play a humanitarian role \u2013 but not the one it was hoping for after a whirlwind of effort by foreign minister Ernesto Ara\u00fajo, who flew to the border to join Guaid\u00f3\u2019s \u201cambassador\u201d to Brazil, Maria Belandria, for a press conference in the border town of Pacaraima on Saturday morning. Instead of aid, its biggest contribution was providing medical treatment for Venezuelans shot by their own security forces. The situation was so volatile that Brazil\u2019s national guard was deployed to control violence that also erupted at the border between Venezuelan demonstrators and Venezuelan national guard on Saturday and Sunday. Two Venezuelan sergeants deserted, said Brazilian colonel Georges Kanaan. Where this leaves the Brazilian government is not clear, as it is dealing with a run of graft crises and clearly divided over its aid policy. The far-right Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, who relentlessly baited Venezuela in a bellicose election campaign, was oddly silent about his foreign minister\u2019s efforts on Saturday, tweeting just once, in Spanish: \u201cStrength to our Venezuelan brothers!\u201d \u201cBrazil has a major humanitarian and geopolitical crisis on its doorstep but its capacity to influence the situation is very limited,\u201d said Oliver Stuenkel, a professor of international relations at S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Getulio Vargas Foundation, a leading business school. \u201cEach scenario affects Brazilian interests but in the end, Brazil is little more than a spectator.\u201d",

The latest survey, published by the Australian on Sunday night, has Labor\u2019s primary vote on 39% and the Coalition\u2019s on 37%. The survey was taken at the tail end of a brutal parliamentary week, where senior government figures were embroiled in controversies, ranging from the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, forgetting to pay for private travel arranged through a Liberal party office holder and donor, and Michaelia Cash facing a fresh barrage of criticism for failing to provide a witness statement to police investigating a leak from her office.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 25 February. Top stories The Morrison government\u2019s border protection offensive has failed to turn around negative voter sentiment, according to the latest Newspoll, with Labor still ahead on the two-party-preferred measure 53% to 47%. The latest survey, published by the Australian on Sunday night, has Labor\u2019s primary vote on 39% and the Coalition\u2019s on 37%. The survey was taken at the tail end of a brutal parliamentary week, where senior government figures were embroiled in controversies, ranging from the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, forgetting to pay for private travel arranged through a Liberal party office holder and donor, and Michaelia Cash facing a fresh barrage of criticism for failing to provide a witness statement to police investigating a leak from her office. Scott Morrison will today deliver a speech in Melbourne announcing that he\u2019s rebadging Tony Abbott\u2019s emissions reduction fund as a \u201cclimate solutions fund\u201d \u2013 with $2bn to be rolled out over 10 years. The emissions reduction fund is a vestige of Abbott\u2019s heavily criticised Direct Action policy. Morrison\u2019s fund will partner with farmers, local governments and businesses to deliver \u201cpractical climate solutions\u201d across the economy that reduce carbon emissions. Labor will commit to a new fund to support measures including 500 new counsellors to help victims of financial services scandals pursue compensation as part of its response to the Hayne royal commission. The banking \u201cfairness\u201d fund, worth $640m over four years, adds to last week\u2019s announcement of a new compensation scheme allowing some victims of banking scandals to have their cases reopened, with the caps for potential payouts lifted to up to $2m. As well as pressing on with Labor\u2019s banking response, Bill Shorten has told Scott Morrison the opposition intends to begin \u201cexercising its right to seek public service briefings\u201d under guidelines associated with the caretaker conventions. An inquest into the death of the Iranian refugee Omid Masoumali is expected to examine why it took more than a day to medically evacuate him to Australia. Masmoumali set himself on fire after almost three years in detention on Nauru. The hearing will begin in Brisbane on Monday morning. It comes amid national debate about medical evacuations, and the passage of independent-led legislation to allow for medically necessary transfers from offshore detention. Masoumali died in Brisbane in April 2016. He was initially treated in hospital in Nauru and later was taken to Brisbane for specialist burns treatment. World Brexit could be delayed until 2021 under plans being explored by the EU\u2019s most senior officials, at a time of growing exasperation over Theresa May\u2019s handling of the talks, the Guardian can reveal. A lengthy extension of the negotiating period is said by EU sources to be favoured by Donald Tusk, the European council president, should the Commons continue to reject May\u2019s deal. Donald Trump and his most senior diplomat moved on Sunday to lower expectations for this week\u2019s summit with North Korea, having previously overstated their progress in blocking its pursuit of a nuclear weapon. The African Union is seeking to kill off the EU\u2019s latest blueprint for stemming migration, claiming that it would breach international law by establishing \u201cde facto detention centres\u201d on African soil, trampling over the rights of those being held.

But<strong> this is the League Cup final</strong>, rather than the FA Cup final, and the storylines around this one might well keep us going until the latter. Manchester City will be gagging to tick off the first of a potential four trophies, and retain this one in the process, make no mistake about that. If they lose today then the chance to achieve something historic, if not massively likely, is gone. But for Chelsea there is something quite different at play.</p> <p><strong>Chelsea last won this competition four years ago and would love to again.</strong> Should they fall short then you\u2019d fancy that Maurizio Sarri is done for; that Chelsea\u2019s revamp is over before it really began and that an exhausting cycle of upheaval starts over again? It was a 6-0 defeat at City a mere fortnight ago that suggested the goose was cooked \u2013 anything close to that would surely seal the deal today although I, for one, suspect we\u2019re in for something much chancier because that is how football tends to go.</p> <p><strong>Players want to win stuff, that\u2019s the bottom line, and Chelsea\u2019s team of seasoned internationals will be desperate to do that today.</strong> There\u2019s no way City are six goals better than Chelsea on a normal day; this isn\u2019t a normal day but it\u2019s a cup final and that\u2019s usually a great leveller. Will it be enough?</p> <p><strong>My view: whatever happens today you can\u2019t ditch Sarri</strong>, because it was obvious *before they even got him in* that he wasn\u2019t simply an instant-results guy, that this would take a year or two to develop and if they go away from that now then, under the current ownership, Chelsea are just going to confirm themselves as a basket case. Do what City did with Pep and let things grow over a quiet-ish first campaign! Has Sarri been hoist by the petard of such a fantastic start to the season, which even saw Chelsea being breathlessly suggested as title contenders in those early weeks? I think that, too. The football in recent weeks really hasn\u2019t been good but he needs longer to get his own people, and ideas, in \u2013 not just Jorginho, whose new status as the fans\u2019 fall guy seems entirely unreasonable and simply a deflection.</p> <p><strong>Anyway. </strong>Will today be the day it all turns for Chelsea and Sarri? Is this all just a jaunty diversion from the inevitable either way? Is it the start of something quiet fabulous for a City side who haven\u2019t always reached last season\u2019s heights? So much to ponder, so little time: we\u2019re off, off and away at 4.30pm UK time.

Thanks for sending so many of yours in, throughout the afternoon, and sorry I couldn\u2019t get through them all. Thanks for your company \u2013 and stay close to the site over the next few hours as we\u2019ll have all the best reaction from Wembley. SARRI IS HERE: \u201cI think we have to talk about football because we played a very good match. In that situation it was a misunderstanding, I heard there was a problem and we needed to change it. I realised the situation only when the doctor arrived on the bench after some minutes. It was a misunderstanding, I understood the goalkeeper had cramp and would be unable to go to the penalties. \u201cI needed only to return, to be quiet I think [on his near-walkout]. As I say, I asked for a change for this physical problem and he said he hadn\u2019t a physical problem. So he was right I think. I have to talk with [Kepa] but only to clarify because now I have understood very well the situation. \u201cI am very happy here. I think in the last three matches we have improved a lot. Today we showed we could become a very solid team. We conceded nothing to the opponents and against Man City that is not easy. I am very proud of my players.\u201d He\u2019s played it down a treat there \u2013 whatever the truth ... Agnello Figueiredo writes: \u201cIt was all simple, really. Sarri had to just call Kepa over to the sidelines and talk to him. That way we wouldn\u2019t be here debating whether Kepa knew, or knew not, what the bench really meant. But I guess it\u2019s easy to talk when you\u2019re not in the heat and dust of battle.\u201d I think your last sentence may be the key there. Things were moving quickly and \u2013 this is important I think \u2013 Moss was also pressing Sarri for a resolution. Ah, some very nice clarity from Ben Mabley on that Les Sealey incident: \u201cLes Sealey did get a massive gash on his leg in the 1991 Rumbelows Cup final against Sheffield Wednesday \u2013 so bad, in fact, that he collapsed at Heathrow later due an infection in the wound. He was told that had he made the flight as planned, he could well have lost his leg. \u201cHe angrily (and famously) remonstrated with the physio Jim McGregor at the suggestion he should be subbed off, justifying this later with the point that there were no substitute goalkeepers at the time (they only came in just over a year later, from 1992/93) so an outfield player would have had to go in goal. He wanted to stay on, avoid that situation, and help Manchester United win. United lost the game 1-0.\u201d Azpilicueta speaks: \u201cWe knew we had to fight very hard to have a chance to win the trophy. We are obviously disappointed, we were a few centimetres from being the champions, but it was not the case so now we have to recover.\u201d On Kepa/Sarri: \u201cHonestly I don\u2019t know, I was on the other side of the pitch so I cannot comment.\u201d Spoken like a true pro. Another question: what else could Sarri have done, in those circumstances? Matthew Pearson sends in his \u2013 laudably nuanced \u2013 take: \u201cKepa thought it was all about whether he was injured or not. Sarri didn\u2019t, and made his decision. Kepa kept doing the thumbs up \u2013 universal footballer language for \u2018I\u2019m fine, move on\u2019. Sarri, sensing it had gone on too long, backed down. Headlines will mention his price tag and say he was acting too big for his gloves. But he\u2019s a young man who is used to gesturing to the bench and saying he\u2019s fine and that being enough. I feel sorry for Sarri, but Kepa was awake during a nightmare situation and him holding his nerve isn\u2019t a show of disrespect. Sarri backing down isn\u2019t a sign of weakness.\u201d Just seen replays of Sarri\u2019s furious reaction when it was clear he wasn\u2019t going to get his way. He was apoplectic ... Don\u2019t miss this \u2013 it\u2019s Daniel Taylor\u2019s match report from Wembley! That\u2019s the generous interpretation and it might end up being the right one \u2013 but everyone\u2019s body language suggested there was more to it. \u201cBomb Kepa out in the summer and sign a replacem ... oh,\u201d writes Ian Sargeant, in some very nifty transfer embargo banter. \u201cSarri wasn\u2019t on his own. His staff including Zola, who was in the dugout, was just as angry/shocked as he,\u201d says Ruth Purdue. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right, it was hard to catch everything that was going on. Can\u2019t wait to hear what he has to say ... Colm writes: \u201cEasy to be critical of Kepa, and clearly his behaviour is appalling, but as a Chelsea fan I\u2019m much more disappointed with the senior players/dressing room leaders \u2013 David Luiz, Rudiger and Azpi should have all been over, marching him off the pitch. Disrespect from the entire team.\u201d Jill O\u2019Donnell wrote in with a similar point. Sarri did seem to be all on his own there. Telling? Guardiola speaks: \u201cI\u2019m happy. Chelsea did an incredible performance. In the penalties anything could happen and we\u2019re lucky. I\u2019m happy to win back to back in this competition. I don\u2019t know if you realise the quality of the players Chelsea have. We knew it\u2019d be more difficult, a final. Many players are injured \u2013 Laporte, Fernandinho \u2013 but it\u2019s better to win the game. We\u2019ll see how far we can go.\u201d Did Kepa think Sarri just thought he was injured? Had Sarri just decided to bring on Caballero regardless for the penalties? We don\u2019t know the answers yet. Sally Officer writes: \u201cKepa should be told to pack his gloves and go. Player power gone mad!\u201d Sam Trenery says: \u201cUtterly despicable behaviour from Kepa. I\u2019m no Chelsea fan, or Sarri fan really, but if he\u2019s sacked now I have a lot of sympathy. Utterly pathetic for a player, any player, to put his own glory before that of the team \u2013 especially the goalkeeper going into a penalty shootout!\u201d My mailbag is bursting at the moment and I\u2019d say the weight of sympathy is heavily in Sarri\u2019s favour. David Wall writes: \u201cOn the radio they\u2019re talking about how this would never have happened to a more authoritative manager such as Clough or Ferguson, but didn\u2019t Les Sealey refuse to be substituted in a cup final after getting a huge gash in his knee (was it the Rumbelows Cup final that they lost to Sheffield Wednesday?\u201d Hmmm, rings a bell but I was very small then. Anybody remember clearly? Player power lives long! City lift the trophy, in the meantime, and cavort accordingly. They\u2019ve now won it four times in six years and, while they really didn\u2019t play that well today, they\u2019re thrilled to have this under their belt. Ruth Purdue writes: \u201cKepa is a disgrace. No excuses should be given to him. If Sarri gets sacked after this, he can keep his head high.\u201d Sarri can be famously blunt so you\u2019d assume that, a little later, he will tell those assembled in the press conference exactly how he perceives the Kepa incident. What do we think on that, by the way? Could Sarri have done anything more? Was it a bad reflection on his management, the player, both? Is it another big step towards the exit door? Sterling speaks: \u201c[Pep] said he didn\u2019t watch [the penalty[ and said where did it go. I said top bins. We kept focused and did the job. One trophy down, we just need to keep winning games and that\u2019s it.\u201d Well, well ... errr ... well. City retain a major trophy for the first time and the celebrations are really kicking in out there. What of Chelsea? You\u2019d have to say they were very good for most of that, the game went as Sarri planned. That is until the final moments of extra-time, when Kepa appeared to humiliate him by plain refusing to go off. He saved a penalty after that, but did it cost them? Bang! Into the top corner and they win 4-3 on penalties! HAZARD ... SCORES! Blimey, he floats a Panenka! 3-3. Sterling to win it ... Bernardo Silva ... SCORES! Down the middle. 3-2 City after four apiece. They\u2019re close. Hazard must score ... David Luiz ... HITS THE POST! 2-2. Sane ... MISSES! Kepa parries to his right and perhaps he\u2019s about to be vindicated, sort of! 2-2 after three apiece. Emerson ... SCORES! Well taken, with power, via Ederson\u2019s hand. 2-2. Aguero ... SCORES! It squirms under Kepa, who really should save it after getting there. My word. 2-1 City after two apiece. Azpilicueta ... SCORES! Nicely into the top corner. 1-1. Gundogan ... SCORES! Kepa is sent the wrong way. 1-0 City after one apiece. Jorginho ... MISSES! Ederson saves a weak, low penalty after a weird skip and jump from the Chelsea man. The penalties will begin imminently. Kepa will keep goal for Chelsea. We shoot towards the Chelsea end, and Chelsea go first. Kepa might well have felt better but did he not consider that ... hey ... Caballero might just be better at saving penalties and that this is a team game? He needs to be the hero now. A penny for Sarri\u2019s thoughts ... at one point he seemed set to walk out of the stadium! Extraordinary scenes at the end there. Kepa would not budge! That is humiliating for Sarri, surely. 120+3 min: We will be hearing a lot more about what we\u2019ve just seen, I can guarantee that. Absolutely surreal. Caballero is sitting down shaking his head. Sarri looks lost. It\u2019s as if a whole afternoon\u2019s restorative work might be undone. 120+1 min: Moss is talking to Sarri. Is this change happening or not? Kepa has overruled his own manager and will stay on the pitch \u2013 this is absolutely ridiculous. Sarri has walked out away from the bench and looks utterly perplexed. I have no idea what we are watching. Who is in control, exactly? 120 min: Kepa wants to stay on. Caballero wants to come on. Sarri wants to bring Caballero on. Kepa is yelling at Sarri, he doesn\u2019t want to go anywhere. What on earth is going on here? Kepa is basically standing his ground here, he wants to be the hero! This is crazy. 118 min: From that, Kepa is down with cramp. I wonder if this is a perfect juncture to bring on Caballero, who likes a shoot-out \u2013 as we saw in the 2016 final ... 117 min: A dangerous Hudson-Odoi run and cross causes brief trouble ... but City break and Rudiger makes a rare stumble, almost allowing Sane through! He recovers but the ball is still worked to Aguero, who cracks in a shot that Kepa gathers at the second attempt! 116 min: Think we\u2019d all like penalties now just for the sight of a net (presumably) rippling, wouldn\u2019t we? 114 min: Now Chelsea have some nice possession, and City let them build, but Azpilicueta is less effective here and his cross floats behind. 110 min: Close, and probably as close as City have come! Sterling zooms electrically to the line, right next to the posts, and squares for Aguero to tap in, surely. But Azpilicueta defends brilliantly, getting enough of a touch to divert the ball onto Kepa rather than into the net. The ball stays alive but Chelsea, eventually, survive! 108 min: Zinchenko\u2019s cross is blocked for a City corner. Gundogan\u2019s delivery is overhit and awful. It\u2019s been a theme today. Can someone, anyone, score ... a goal? Worth a reminder with the stress upon Sarri likely to be high at this stage. This, incidentally, is one of the best games I\u2019ve seen Rudiger play for Chelsea. He\u2019s been an absolute rock. As you were. And as you will be in a quarter of an hour, unless something surprising comes to pass. 103 min: Hazard now goes high, wide and fairly hideous from similar range. 101 min: Jorginho, in the meantime, wafts an effort wide from 25 yards and Chelsea continue to look slightly the more likely. 101 min: I genuinely don\u2019t think Manchester City have had a decent chance to score in this game. Can you remember one? 98 min: Chelsea have a corner, won by Hudson-Odoi, after a nice run and switch from Higuain. He\u2019s added some presence for them in a key area. Hazard\u2019s cross is dealt with but Chelsea keep up the pressure and Hazard gets another chance, this time on the volley, to serve up some trouble. Ederson gathers, though, with Rudiger lurking. 96 min: Now then \u2013 here comes Higuain, in place of Willian. Chelsea have some real firepower on there now! 94 min: Gundogan takes aim from 25 yards and everybody, bar Chelsea\u2019s players, staff and fans, wishes he hadn\u2019t. 93 min: Will this be one of those ultra-cagey extra time periods or will tired legs tell and chances flow? Nothing has happened yet, if you wanted an early steer. Chelsea have as good a chance of winning this as City. Another City change \u2013 Danilo for Fernandinho. Fair play, that was a very good second half from Chelsea in all departments and they might even have sneaked it. We get another 30! 90+4 min: Loftus-Cheek brings the ball down *beautifully* and sends Hazard scampering clear! But he\u2019s ... oooh ... a fraction offside. I think he was level with Zinchenko \u2013 that would have been a clear chance to win it! 90+3 min: City get that away, via good defending from Zinchenko and Kompany. 90+2 min: Otamendi is the latest to decide a yellow card is better than being left on his own backside, scything Hazard down on the left. David Luiz gees the Chelsea fans up as they await another well-placed set piece. Willian whips it under the bar, and Ederson has to touch it behind for a corner! 90+1 min: Four added minutes to avoid extra time ... 88 min: City, though, weather the mini-storm and tear upfield, Jorginho taking a booking with a very necessary foul on Sterling. Loftus-Cheek now replaces Barkley for Chelsea. 87 min: That\u2019s some lovely skill from Hudson-Odoi on the touchline and a very unlovely foul from Zinchenko to stop him making ground. Chelsea have free-kick, from which they manage a fair spell of pressure, ending with a Hudson-Odoi centre that is desperately cleared away. 86 min: Here comes Leroy Sane \u2013 replacing De Bruyne, who just hasn\u2019t got going today. Can Sane turn this for City at the death, as he did at Schalke on Wednesday? 85 min: Hudson-Odoi looks lively so far, but hasn\u2019t managed to get away into any space yet. Chelsea are giving as good as they get as we enter the last five minutes of normal time. 83 min: Kante has, along with Hazard, had a fine second half. Might have scored though! 81 min: The fire of five, ten minutes ago has dulled a bit. I\u2019d be very surprised if we don\u2019t get an extra 30. 79 min: Gundogan replaces the quiet David Silva. And Hudson-Odoi, to huge cheers, replaces Pedro. Can he produce something magical? 76 min: Another Chelsea chance! Hazard, who has been brilliant since half-time, lays Pedro into space on the right of the area, but instead of going for goal \u2013 as he\u2019d have been entitled to do \u2013 he looks to square back to the Belgian, only for Zinchenko to intervene just in time. A corner results but City clear. It feels like a final now, this. 73 min: ... and it\u2019s wasted badly. The shot flies way off. De Bruyne is yet to fire today. 73 min: A blistering City counter, of the kind they\u2019ve rarely been afforded, sees Chelsea resort to desperate measures. Willian bundles De Bruyne over but advantage is played \u2013 until Rudiger, who is booked, desperately fouls Bernardo Silva 22 yards out. It\u2019s a chance for De Bruyne to shoot ... 71 min: Now Barkley, teed up by Willian, floats one over. I\u2019d go as far as saying that Chelsea, when they do attack, look the more dangerous team. 69 min: Walker makes inroads into the box but can\u2019t get a shot off. A bit of a raised-stakes feel to this now \u2013 it\u2019s got a little frantic, hopefully in a good way. 67 min: Closest yet \u2013 and it\u2019s a big chance for Chelsea! Hazard makes another of those runs into space down the left, a bit wider this time, and beats Kompany with an ease that will encourage Chelsea greatly. He gets to the byline, lays back, and Kante is running in 12 yards out ... but smashes over! It could, perhaps should, be 1-0 to Sarri\u2019s men. 64 min: City passing, passing, passing but doing little, little, little to suggest we aren\u2019t heading for extra time. Hello Jose. 61 min: Some lovely, waifish play from Bernardo Silva down the right brings a cross, but Rudiger heads away. Still no real sign of a big chance, even if the game has a little more to it now. 59 min: Fernandinho is booked for a foul and it\u2019s a nice, central set-piece for Chelsea, who might just have arrived at this game now. It\u2019s ludicrously far out for a shot ... but that doesn\u2019t deter David Luiz, whose powerful-sidefoot schtick goes wrong here and sees the ball fly way, way behind. 57 min: Corner to City. It\u2019s a better start to this half. It bounces around the area and falls to Aguero, who controls a mishit Otamendi shot and finishes coolly! But he\u2019s half a foot offside \u2013 a decision confirmed after a lengthy VAR delay in which you wondered, for a split second, whether the goal might actually be given. 53 min: Oooh, Hazard has open grass to run into down the left \u2013 there\u2019s one of those spaces! At his best he might just streak away, jink into the box and finish ... but, after he gets inside the area, he seems to lose some confidence and stalls, checking back and allowing Otamendi to rob him. Not an unreasonable reading. 50 min: Kepa fumbles a fairly standard De Bruyne cross and is lucky that Aguero has already run ahead of the ball. 48 min: \u201cI hope John Terry has his kit on just in case Chelsea win this,\u201d quips Ally. He\u2019s in the Sky studio and has already slipped a few \u201cwe\u201d in. Meanwhile De Bruyne delivers a dangerous ball from the right and, eventually, Fernandinho fires well over from range. 47 min: Pedro immediately makes a nice run down the right, is felled, and wins Chelsea a chance to load the box. Willian delivers into what is actually a very good area in the Corridor Of Uncertainty, but they clear didn\u2019t load the box well enough because nobody attacks it. A goal? A chance? Something? Manchester City substitution: Kompany for Laporte (hamstring). Shouldn\u2019t change much ... should it? Don\u2019t forget that if it\u2019s still like this in around 50 minutes\u2019 time, we will have extra-time. If that\u2019s to be the case, let\u2019s hope it has at least opened up a bit by then. Chucky writes: \u201cHow many 0-0s is that from the top clubs this week across comps? Too many defensive coaches! Boring as.\u201d I think Jonathan Wilson had a point here. The pendulum always swings. Regarding that question on London clubs at Wembley, Phil West has crunched some of the numbers so the rest of us didn\u2019t have to: \u201cSince 1900 (according to Wiki) London clubs playing non-London clubs in the FA Cup final are 28-14 ahead. There are also a few occasions where two London teams were involved, but I ignored them. I\u2019m not sure if this means anything though \u2013 as years ago it was quite common for less successful teams to have a cup run only to lose in the final. Comparing results since the year 2007 gives a 6-2 score in favour of London teams.\u201d Nobody would say this has been much good. But, in fairness to Chelsea, it\u2019s probably gone as Sarri intended. They have kept City at arm\u2019s length and limited them to half-chances at best. 45+2 min: Almost severe embarrassment for Otamendi as he heads a Chelsea free-kick towards his own goal, with no opposition player near, and sees it fly only narrowly wide as Ederson dives desperately! So Chelsea have a corner with the half\u2019s last action, but it causes no danger. 45 min: First real bit of spark from Hazard, who does well to outdo Laporte but then, with men arriving very late in support, tries to do a bit too much in a tight space and sees City eventually block his attempt on goal. 43 min: Another City corner, now, and they\u2019re applying some real pressure again. David Luiz beats Laporte to it, but that\u2019s not the end of the story. Zinchenko plays the ball in again and Otamendi \u2013 ghosting in at the back post as a minute previously \u2013 gets a toe to the ball but not with enough power to beat Kepa. 42 min: Willian concedes a free-kick on the right after Chelsea lose the ball in their own half three times in quick succession while passing out aimlessly in pursuit of nothing. It\u2019s another very dangerous area. De Bruyne\u2019s cross again goes beyond everybody but Sterling, delivering from the left, sees his ball kept alive acrobatically by Otemendi at the far post. It looks good, but Chelsea clear. 39 min: De Bruyne, with a smart touch past David Luiz, reaches the byline but overhits his cross. Sterling, on the other side, twists Azpilicueta about sublimely at first but eventually runs out of space and Chelsea earn a goal kick. 37 min: It really has been low on excitement so far, let\u2019s be honest. Sarri has gone for Get A Result And Save My Job tactics, and I\u2019ve seen nothing to suggest they don\u2019t have a chance of squeaking it out that way. City aren\u2019t moving the ball as they can and chances aren\u2019t really coming. 34 min: It\u2019s not much but we are seeing a bit more from Chelsea now. Kante tries to get away down the right but can\u2019t reach it. City still have the initiative though and force an awkward hack away from Rudiger just outside the six-yard box. 32 min: Chelsea enjoy a little play around the City box, now, and Fernandinho has to be well positioned to stop Hazard latching onto a floated Jorginho ball into the area. 31 min: ... which is delivered by De Bruyne, who has been quiet so far, but Chelsea cope just fine. 30 min: That\u2019s a deserved yellow card for David Luiz, who agriculturally dumps Bernardo Silva over as the City man wriggles deftly away from him near the right byline. Dangerous free-kick here ... 28 min: A shot on target from Aguero, who links with David Silva before firing one from 20 yards, slightly deflected, that Kepa dives onto and holds. So, in fairness, it\u2019s going as Sarri probably hoped. 26 min: But now Chelsea do have an attack, sweeping upfield adroitly, and earn a free-kick midway inside the City half, a little to the right. It\u2019s their first real chance to put some pressure on. Willian arrows it to the back stick, Pedro heads down but nobody is poised to latch onto it. 25 min: If you were Hazard you\u2019d probably rather be in Madrid than chasing waste paper like this. 22 min: Best bit of action so far \u2013 Bernardo Silva floats a lovely right-to-left ball over Azpilicueta and Aguero, deep inside the box, chests down and sets himself before lashing over from an awkward angle. 21 min: Little comes of it. But it\u2019s only City doing any attacking. We\u2019ve not seen Hazard at all yet! 20 min: Maybe possession from the back will die and football will evolve to the extent that, in five years\u2019 time, everyone is playing percentage football and the real heroes are a generation of miniature Dave Bassetts. While we ponder that, Rudiger defends well from a dangerous Bernardo Silva ball and it\u2019s another City corner. 18 min: Some fairly heavy City pressure, now, but Luiz clears two crosses from the left. Chelsea are sitting off until City get 15 yards into their half. 17 min: Kepa looks dodgy with the ball at his feet so far, which doesn\u2019t help the previous point. 16 min: The thing is that Chelsea *insist* on passing the ball around from the back even though there are no options to progress the move and City keep pressing them aggressively. So the ball gets given away every single time. I know it\u2019s the way everyone has to play now but it so often becomes frayed and useless. You\u2019re probably not going to score the perfect goal from there, guys, so why not do it as and when? 13 min: Laporte feeds David Silva in a nice little pocket of space but his touch uncharacteristically lets him down. It\u2019s been a reasonably drab start, overall. 12 min: JR in Illinois is frothing \u2013 \u201cHave you re-watched what Jorginho did to Aguero in the first second of the game? It was not a \u2018stray arm\u2019 by Jorginho. It was a deliberate elbow aimed squarely at Aguero\u2019s face. He didn\u2019t make a clean connection, just a glancing blow, but it was as clear a red card offence as you\u2019d want to see. And Moss was standing five feet away. Unbelievable.\u201d I\u2019ll have to watch again at half-time. It would \u2013 and seemingly should \u2013 have been pretty much the quickest red card in history! 10 min: Fairly clear, now, that Chelsea are taking the conservative approach. But they cause a flutter now as a long switch from Emerson beats a badly positioned Laporte and almost sends Kante running clear. He is blocked off, legally, by Zinchenko but there were some brief howls of anguish from their fans. 8 min: The referee is Jonathan Moss, by the way. City keep pressing but Chelsea are offering up some spicy challenges and don\u2019t look like giving up chances easily just now. Rudiger has stepped in well a couple of times already. 5 min: Yes, it\u2019s a good start from City and now Aguero benefits from a ricochet and surges down the right, claiming a handball after a defender blocks his cross. Nothing is given. 3 min: City keeping the ball well early on. Has Sarri gone for the template that beat them in December? 1 min: Blimey \u2013 literally straight from kick-off Aguero tries to run past Jorginho and is sent flying by a stray arm. Looks very painful but he gets up, City take the free kick and then win an early corner .... which is cleared by Barkley. The death of Sarriball or the birth of something beautiful? It\u2019s an interesting question, to be fair. I doubt if I can find the answers in the next four minutes, but if anyone has stats to hand then do whack them over. The teams are striding out at Wembley right now \u2013 there\u2019ll be meeting, greeting, pleasantries, anthems, and then we\u2019ll be away! Oh gosh, yes, and shame on me because I\u2019m writing this a mere hop, skip, jump from Arsenal\u2019s home. They beat Southampton 2-0 with early Lacazette and Mkhitaryan goals! Joe Pearson writes: \u201cPerversely, with respect to Europa League qualification, it doesn\u2019t matter who wins this final (presuming the standings hold). If Chelsea wins, they qualify automatically. If City wins, the qualification falls to ... Chelsea.\u201d That is true and a good point. The stakes for Chelsea and Sarri are even higher than that though, I think. So does Pep, briefly! \u201c[The 6-0] was an incredibly important result for us but today is a final, a different competition, and hopefully we can play the game like a final deserves to be played.\u201d Sarri speaks! \u201cWe have played every three days [since the 6-0] so it\u2019s difficult to work on the pitch. We have talked a lot to try and improve. Two months ago we played [City] and won with a match of very great application. We know we can do better and better. \u201cI cannot understand why you ask me [about his future] because you know very well I can only give my opinion. You have to ask the club.\u201d We were not regaled with his opinion. \u201cChelsea playing the same frontline that beat City 2-0 late last year,\u201d notes Neil Bailey, and he has a point. Strange game, that was, because Chelsea got a grip of it after reverting very much to Plan B \u2013 ceding possession, basically. It finished goalless at Old Trafford, and was rather a slog. Half an hour til this one now ... Very nice from Paul Wilson, this, on how Chelsea could learn from City\u2019s example: The quality in United v Liverpool has been ... lacking, shall we say. We\u2019ll get better at Wembley, surely. Chelsea fans: right call to leave Higuain on the bench? Don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard, but there\u2019s another game on at the moment. Simon Burnton will take you through the delicately-poised last knockings of Manchester United v Liverpool and then I\u2019ll have much more from this one. Get your thoughts and predictions in to me, in the meantime! Chelsea: Kepa, Azpilicueta, R\u00fcdiger, David Luiz, Emerson, Kant\u00e9, Jorginho, Barkley, Willian, Hazard, Pedro. Subs: Caballero, Christiansen, Kovacic, Loftus-Cheek, Hudson-Odoi, Giroud, Higuain. Manchester City: Ederson, Zinchenko, Laporte, Otamendi, Walker, Fernandinho, Silva, De Bruyne, Bernardo, Sterling, Aguero. Subs: Muric, Danilo, Kompany, Gundogan, Sane, Mahrez, Foden. Strong from City, with Ederson in goal rather than Muric, who would usually expect to play in this competition. Guardiola is clearly desperate for the win. No Hudson-Odoi from the start for Chelsea despite his goal against Malmo on Thursday, but Jorginho and Hazard are among those to return \u2013 and Barkley starts. Higuain is on the bench. Presumably we will see Hazard as false nine, which tends to work well against lesser teams but not against good ones. The sun\u2019s out in north London, Wembley looks resplendent, you\u2019d almost think it is May. But this is the League Cup final, rather than the FA Cup final, and the storylines around this one might well keep us going until the latter. Manchester City will be gagging to tick off the first of a potential four trophies, and retain this one in the process, make no mistake about that. If they lose today then the chance to achieve something historic, if not massively likely, is gone. But for Chelsea there is something quite different at play. Chelsea last won this competition four years ago and would love to again. Should they fall short then you\u2019d fancy that Maurizio Sarri is done for; that Chelsea\u2019s revamp is over before it really began and that an exhausting cycle of upheaval starts over again? It was a 6-0 defeat at City a mere fortnight ago that suggested the goose was cooked \u2013 anything close to that would surely seal the deal today although I, for one, suspect we\u2019re in for something much chancier because that is how football tends to go. Players want to win stuff, that\u2019s the bottom line, and Chelsea\u2019s team of seasoned internationals will be desperate to do that today. There\u2019s no way City are six goals better than Chelsea on a normal day; this isn\u2019t a normal day but it\u2019s a cup final and that\u2019s usually a great leveller. Will it be enough? My view: whatever happens today you can\u2019t ditch Sarri, because it was obvious *before they even got him in* that he wasn\u2019t simply an instant-results guy, that this would take a year or two to develop and if they go away from that now then, under the current ownership, Chelsea are just going to confirm themselves as a basket case. Do what City did with Pep and let things grow over a quiet-ish first campaign! Has Sarri been hoist by the petard of such a fantastic start to the season, which even saw Chelsea being breathlessly suggested as title contenders in those early weeks? I think that, too. The football in recent weeks really hasn\u2019t been good but he needs longer to get his own people, and ideas, in \u2013 not just Jorginho, whose new status as the fans\u2019 fall guy seems entirely unreasonable and simply a deflection. Anyway. Will today be the day it all turns for Chelsea and Sarri? Is this all just a jaunty diversion from the inevitable either way? Is it the start of something quiet fabulous for a City side who haven\u2019t always reached last season\u2019s heights? So much to ponder, so little time: we\u2019re off, off and away at 4.30pm UK time. So get your thoughts in via email and/or Twitter right now!",

Anything other than victory here would have been tough for them to take, given the nature of how they put their bodies on the line for more than 80 gruelling minutes in a backdrop of injuries and adversity. So when Oliver Gildart crossed to level the scores with seconds remaining, you wondered how Hull \u2013 and Radford \u2013 would pick themselves up. However, Zak Hardaker\u2019s wayward conversion handed the Black and Whites a reprieve and gave us the first golden point extra-time in Super League \u2013 and how they seized the opportunity. Within seconds of play restarting, Marc Sneyd\u2019s drop goal secured that long-awaited victory. \u201cHe\u2019s the iceman,\u201d Radford said of his scrum-half. \u201cI\u2019m relieved for them, the players.

Wigan\u2019s response came from Gildart and Liam Byrne \u2013 but this was a below-par performance from the champions, who have one win from their first three games. \u201cThere weren\u2019t good signs throughout the match,\u201d said their coach, Adrian Lam. Naulago\u2019s second four minutes after half-time put Hull in control, though as injuries began to bite, the visitors began to tire noticeably.

      "bodyText": "Chris Woakes is known as The Wizard among his teammates but, as he prepares to return to the fray in a postcard\u2011perfect Grenada on Monday, England\u2019s most reliable seamer maintains there is no magic behind his success with the new ball. The 29-year-old missed the series levelling defeat in Barbados on Friday because of ongoing management of tendonitis in his right knee. Though a late collapse ultimately cost England a 2-0 lead, it was only the second time in 10 matches they have failed to take a wicket in the opening powerplay. Woakes was also missing on the previous occasion \u2013 Sri Lanka in Colombo last October \u2013 and this is more than coincidence; over the past two years he has the best average in the world during the first 10 overs, taking 22 wickets at 17.36 runs apiece. The resumption of hostilities with West Indies on Monday at Queen\u2019s Park \u2013 with an earlier start of 1.30pm GMT because the ground has no floodlights \u2013 involves a short boundary and a seemingly flat pitch. Chris Gayle and John Campbell, two aggressive Jamaicans, may seek to take advantage but Woakes simply views this as an opportunity to strike. \u201cIf they make a mistake you may take a pole or create a chance,\u201d Woakes said. \u201cMy mantra is to put the ball where they don\u2019t want it \u2013 there\u2019s no real magic behind it. It\u2019s the time when you\u2019re most likely to get a little bit of movement.\u201d Gayle has not exactly raced out of the blocks this series, of course, with scores of 135 and 50 built on a heavy diet of dot balls first up. Woakes, the only England bowler yet to be heaved out of the ground by the 39-year-old, is taking little for granted. \u201cThat\u2019s not always the way Gayle plays \u2013 we\u2019ve played games against him where he\u2019s gone from ball one,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to expect the unexpected. He can easily come out and try and hit you for six from the first few balls. You need to be on it and prepared for anything. He\u2019s done it for a long period of time. It\u2019s exciting to watch ... unless you\u2019re bowling.\u201d West Indies teammates may be denied singles or twos by Gayle\u2019s glacial running between the crease but Darren Bravo, speaking ahead of his 100th cap, said: \u201cHe\u2019s probably getting a little slow. He can still hit two sixes in the next over and make up for the single that was deprived from the other batter. He\u2019s not even a hero; he\u2019s a legend.\u201d Woakes says he was fit to play on Friday and with gaps chiefly of four or five days between group games at the World Cup this summer he remains confident his dicky knee \u2013 something he has managed for at least five years \u2013 can stand up to scrutiny in the tournament.

However, she makes a serious mistake in saying that were this done \u201csome abuse might be avoided\u201d. Let us clearly see abusers for what they are. The desire to have sex with children is not born of sexual frustration, and to imply this fails to recognise the reasons why abusers might become priests.</p> <p>The Catholic church, like other organisations such as schools, sports clubs and the BBC, has proved attractive to paedophiles because it has enabled them to have contact with children in a way that avoids suspicion as to their real motives, and allows them to avoid detection. The church, in common with these other organisations, now has a serious duty to secure its safeguarding practice so as to avoid this ever happening again.</p> <p>Protecting children against paedophiles is a complex process. To consider that abolishing clerical celibacy would be a sensible first step for the church shows a dangerous lack of understanding of this problem, as all the many children abused by married laymen can testify.<br><strong>Dr Marcella McCarthy</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 Catherine Pepinster (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/21/pope-francis-truth-sexual-abuse-summit\" title=\"\">The moment of truth on abuse has arrived for Pope Francis</a>, 21 February) rejects the idea that celibacy in the Catholic priesthood is responsible for grooming and abuse, noting that the paedophiles Jimmy Savile and Rolf Harris were not celibates. She then adds that the culture of celibacy could well lead to abuse not being reported.</p> <p>But abuse has not been reported in other, non-celibate, cultures including non-Catholic schools, the media, the film industry, the Church of England. The problem is one of institutional self-protection. Institutions do not like to admit their failures. The difficulties with Catholicism and abuse are only too clear, both to those within and those outside the church; but let\u2019s not pretend that its problems are peculiar to it.<br><strong>Colin Armstrong</strong><br><em>Belfast</em></p> <p>\u2022 One practical step the Vatican could take to deal constructively with the sexual abuse scandal (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/21/pope-francis-vows-concrete-measures-at-landmark-child-abuse-summit\" title=\"\">Pope\u2019s plan to tackle longstanding scandal inadequate, say survivors</a>, 22 February) is to instruct its representatives to cooperate with the civil authorities in public inquiries.

      "bodyText": "Jane Harding (Letters, 21 February) may well be right in thinking that the principle of clerical celibacy should be re-examined. However, she makes a serious mistake in saying that were this done \u201csome abuse might be avoided\u201d. Let us clearly see abusers for what they are. The desire to have sex with children is not born of sexual frustration, and to imply this fails to recognise the reasons why abusers might become priests. The Catholic church, like other organisations such as schools, sports clubs and the BBC, has proved attractive to paedophiles because it has enabled them to have contact with children in a way that avoids suspicion as to their real motives, and allows them to avoid detection. The church, in common with these other organisations, now has a serious duty to secure its safeguarding practice so as to avoid this ever happening again. Protecting children against paedophiles is a complex process. To consider that abolishing clerical celibacy would be a sensible first step for the church shows a dangerous lack of understanding of this problem, as all the many children abused by married laymen can testify. Dr Marcella McCarthy Oxford \u2022 Catherine Pepinster (The moment of truth on abuse has arrived for Pope Francis, 21 February) rejects the idea that celibacy in the Catholic priesthood is responsible for grooming and abuse, noting that the paedophiles Jimmy Savile and Rolf Harris were not celibates. She then adds that the culture of celibacy could well lead to abuse not being reported. But abuse has not been reported in other, non-celibate, cultures including non-Catholic schools, the media, the film industry, the Church of England. The problem is one of institutional self-protection. Institutions do not like to admit their failures. The difficulties with Catholicism and abuse are only too clear, both to those within and those outside the church; but let\u2019s not pretend that its problems are peculiar to it. Colin Armstrong Belfast \u2022 One practical step the Vatican could take to deal constructively with the sexual abuse scandal (Pope\u2019s plan to tackle longstanding scandal inadequate, say survivors, 22 February) is to instruct its representatives to cooperate with the civil authorities in public inquiries. The Church of England has cooperated with the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse. The papal nuncio in England has refused cooperation and withheld papers. If he did not hold diplomatic immunity, he could be charged with a criminal offence for this. What is the Vatican going to do about it?

However, the \u2018Bet Regret\u2019 advert was sandwiched between adverts from Bet365, Betfair, Paddy Power and Sky Bet, leading to criticism from campaigners who said the message was \u201cdrowned out\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Here is the match report from Rome: A nice moment for Jack Cart who made his Ireland debut today. It might not have been a classic performance from the team but it will be a day he never forgets. Full O\u2019Shea reaction Schmidt says Murray took over the kicking duties from Sexton as the latter was \u201cgetting a kicking out there\u201d. Jacob Stockdale\u2019s reaction O\u2019Shea says Italy gifted Stockdale a try but showed heart and desire. Adding that this performance will show that Italy will not roll over. It\u2019s France next up for Ireland and you have to assume Schmidt will need to change a few things to ensure it\u2019s a competitive game, as they will need to improve from today\u2019s offering. Some Conor Murray try action Stockdale says his try was very lucky but he showed great anticipation to take control of the ball after a couple of Italians missed the kick-off. Brian O\u2019Driscoll points out that this was a pretty average performance from Ireland and that they need to go back to basics. O\u2019Mahony: \u201cWe know how difficult it is when we come here. Conor is doing a great job and Italy are a great rugby team.\u201d He adds that it was great to secure their second away win of the competition. Ireland may have won but they certainly have a lot of work to do after that showing. They made a few changes but to look that rusty in a World Cup year must be very worrying for the coaching staff. Almost an exciting end there when Stockdale collected the missed McKinley penalty, ran down half the length of the pitch before seeing his offload dropped by Earls and the referee blowing for full-time. It was a great performance from Italy but they just fell short in the end, as Ireland showed a little extra quality and a touch more cunning to get through this tough encounter in Rome. 80+2 min: Italy get a couple of penalties as they look to get a losing bonus point. 78 min: Ireland are keeping hold of the ball here as they look to break down Italy and also let the clock tick down. 76 min: McKinley comes on for Italy. The Irishman, who is blind in his left eye, will really enjoy this moment, I am sure. 74 min: Italy are showing there is still life in them with some great work on the right wing. A couple of forwards then try to power through down the middle. Ruzza looks to get to the line but loses it at the crucial moment when hit by Kearney. 72 min: Allan puts a great kick into the corner to earn a lineout following a penalty being rewarded for a high tackle on Campagnaro. Sadly for the hosts, the knocked it on to give the ball back to Ireland. 69 min: Ireland now have the bonus point after that latest try and it really should be game over. Italy\u2019s defensive frailties have been shown up again here. An Ireland maul ends in a try for Murray. O\u2019Mahony takes the lineout and is then joined by a number of his teammates, who power the ball towards the line, ending with Murray stretching to get the ball down. The scrum-half himself then gets the kick, too. 65 min: It\u2019s Italy\u2019s turn to start a quick move after being given a free-kick followed a failed scrum. Sexton strips the ball to win it back and then gets a penalty, allowing him to kick for touch 15 metres from the whitewash. 63 min: Earls strides through the line at pace after some quick passes off the back of a lineout but Italy just about chase him down just when it looks like he\u2019s in the clear. Earls however keeps his wits about him and offloads to Stockdale, who can\u2019t keep hold of it. 61 min: Ireland try to get themselves going with a quick throw-in. Farrell leads the change but only makes it to the edge of his own 22. A late tackle on Sexton results in a penalty for Ireland. Italy need to avoid giving away such silly penalties to stay in this. 59 min: Paul emails in: \u201cIf Ireland don\u2019t put this game away swiftly and show their mettle to beat the minnows and the real titans in all phases of the game, RWC 2019 is going to be another missed opportunity for Earls, Sefton and co.\u201d This certainly is a time to show what they can do against a weaker team. 57 min: Italy skew the scrum to the left, which sees a penalty given against them. Ireland move quickly down the pitch and enjoy some quick hands but Italy just about manage to block the spaces in their defence. 55 min: Padovani does extremely well to hold onto a pass around his ankles and then lifts his head up to see a gap. Sadly the move comes to an end after Zanni is penalised for a knock-on despite the fact it looked to have hit his knee. 53 min: Ireland drive the ball over the halfway line but struggle to make any more progress as Italy push them back to show they are very much still in a game. After a long process of trying to power their way over Earls takes a couple of steps to the right and goes through a tiny gap he earned for himself. Murray coverts to give Ireland a three-point lead. 50 min: Ireland move it quickly inside the Italy 22 but just can\u2019t find the desired gap. They eventually come back for a penalty under posts but decide to tap thinking a try is coming. It is a similar theme as Ireland try to force their way through but Italy hold them up well as Ireland throw everything at them. 48 min: Another penalty goes the way of Ireland after the referee calls an offside. Ireland kick for touch, allowing incoming hooker Scannell, who replaces Cronin, a chance to show what he can do. His first throw finds its destination, which is a positive. 46 min: Italy give away penalty after O\u2019Mahony stops the release with the ball on the floor. It was a dangerous situation at the time but they were unable to make the most of it. 44 min: Ireland have started terribly here. An up and under is dropped by Kearney. This is utterly useless from Ireland, if they do not improve they are set for a shock defeat. Someone on the pitch needs to get them going. 42 min: Sexton\u2019s kick-off did not go 10 metres, which is a pretty underwhelming way to start a half. Let\u2019s hope things improve. Here we go again!!! It will be interesting to see how Italy deal with being ahead. They are certainly better attacking than defending, so will need to keep that positive attitude rather than considering holding on. The first Italy try was pretty decent move ... Italy are making me looking rather silly here, but not as silly as Ireland are looking. The visitors looked dangerous early but apart from the Stockdale try the invention levels have been rock bottom. They need to be quicker with it and find the holes which are there, as Italy look flawed defensively. Italy on the other hand are the superior attacking team with Tebadli, Padovani and Hayward all looking like breaking the lines. Italy are looking the better team in attack her and rightly go into the break leading, but Ireland have been pretty lacklustre throughout the opening period. Cronin gets the lineout right, allowing Ireland to get a maul going. They earn some good territory but Italy win it back and kick clear. Padovani is chief chaser of Tebaldi\u2019s kick and it ends up in the corner, before it swung out to the other side where Morisi collects after Tuivaiti is tackled, before powering over the line. There could be a shock on here ... 36 min: Italy looking good going forward here but they really need to work on their defence as Ireland will take advantage of the problems the hosts have there. Hayward shows some quick feet to defeat the Ireland defence after the visitors lost a lineout, but they just about hold him up in the end, but that is not the end of the danger as the ball is chucked out to the opposite wing by Allan to Padovani who runs it in. Allan can\u2019t convert from the wing, sadly. 32 min: Sexton fails to find touch with a kick, allowing Italy the chance to attack but after some quick passing, the Irish fly-half snatches the ball back. 30 min: Tebaldi breaks down field and sends a kick beyond last man Kearney, who he then runs into, cueing boos from the home fans who think their man was blocked by the Irish full-back. The referee awards nothing. A reminder of the second Irish try: 28 min: A low-trajectory kick from Sexton finds Stockdale on the wing from the restart, allowing Ireland to attack. Italy suffer some quick hands going across the field and they get a penalty. Padovani receives a pass to his feet when in space on the right wing, which is a shame as if it was into his hands he would have been one-on-one. On the upside, they then get a penalty for offside, which Allan converts. 24 min: Aki\u2019s game is over after failing his head injury assessment, disappointing for him but it\u2019s certainly the right thing for the circumstances. Well well well ... the kick-off is completely missed by the Italian forwards and then it bounces off another, allowing Stockdale to take hold of the ball and sprint through the space to touch down. Poor from Italy. Sexton sends the conversion just wide. Italy almost get a try of their own but Campagnaro is penalised for trying to restart play having been tackled. Luckily for them it goes back for a penalty to the hosts and Allan smashes it through the sticks. 18 min: Italy\u2019s Allan aims for a very long penalty but it lacks any sort of accuracy, which is a shame. 16 min: Ireland are happy to throw the ball around, knowing that gaps will eventually appear in this Italy defence. One arrives as Earls cuts in from the right wing, sees off a couple of players and then sends a grubber kick for Conway to chase but Hayward reads it and removes the danger. 14 min: The Italy defence could not cope with Farrell going through the middle and could be in for a long 80 minutes if they are going to defend like that. Farrell almost powered his way over the line but is held up short but Roux thrusts himself over the whitewash. Sexton then hits the conversion through the posts. 9 min: This time Italy earn a penalty in their own 22 for a maul collapse. The scrum goes a lot better on this occasion, allowing them to kick downfield to relieve pressure. 7 min: Italy give away another penalty for collapsing the maul on this occasion. It\u2019s been a very bitty start due to the indiscretions. Ireland will take advantage of this sooner or later. 5 min: A few early mistakes from both sides in the early stages, Murray the latest culprit as he needlessly knocks on. The subsequent scrum goes nowhere as Italy can\u2019t cope with the Irish pack, earning a penalty for the visitors but nothing comes of it as they lose the lineout. 3 min: Italy have started with decent intensity but Ireland are showing they are willing to throw it around in attack. Campagnaro and Hayward look good for Italy and could cause problems for the Irish defence. 1 min: Let\u2019s get ready to rumble! A few tears in the eyes of the Italy team during the national anthem. There might be a few more at full-time. The teams are out on the pitch in front of a stadium which is a long way from being full but I think there are more there today than when Wales played there. They are greeted by a collection of flag bearers dressed in medieval gear. Lawrence Dallaglio says Italy really need to make improvement in defence, as conceding four five tries a game is not really a successful policy. O\u2019Shea tells ITV that Italy need to learn how to learn how to operate under pressure, as there is generally minimal pressure when you\u2019re always losing. Some good news for English rugby today ... Gar emails in: \u201cThe thing is getting the crowds to go on attending at Stadio Olimpico. \u201cThey are in proportion to the success of the team, and dwindling fast for Six Nations games. however after the excitement of the WC they will be able to take the European bull by the horns and have a three match win perhaps, in 2020. That would be good for their game, and improved play. Anybody who performs in a public place for an audience knows that the finesse of the performance is always improved by the applause gained. Even a primary school piano teacher knows that. Treviso is now a pretty good team, I\u2019m sure you agree, and there is, just like Scotland, a plentiful supply of Rugby teams in Italia.\u201d It\u2019s an interesting choice of suit, that\u2019s for sure ... Conor Murray and Jonathan Sexton start together at 9 and 10 for the 50th time in Test matches, which is a pretty impressive feat. They are the third half-back pair to reach this milestone together in the professional era - after Australia\u2019s George Gregan and Stephen Larkham (78) and Irish pair Peter Stringer and Ronan O\u2019Gara (55). Hooker Sean Cronin is making his first Six Nations start. \u201cI am sure that Sean is excited,\u201d said Joe Schmidt. \u201cHe has come off the bench and made an impact any number of times so why not do it from the start? It is not that he does not know that we have faith in him. He is very much team-oriented and will want to put his best foot forward and he is up against a very experienced opponent.\u201d Italy did beat Ireland 22-15 back in 2013 but since then they have been beaten by at least 23 points in their Six Nations encounters, which does not bode well. This the first time Sergio Parisse has missed a Six Nations match in nearly four years. His last absence was during the 2015 Championship when Italy lost 61-20 at home to Wales. There has been plenty of change in the Italy camp in the last 12 months, with only four players in Italy\u2019s starting XV today started the match against Ireland in last year\u2019s competition. Simone Ferrari, Dean Budd, Braam Steyn and Tommaso Allan are that quartet. Still no Six Nations victory for O\u2019Shea as Italy boss - here Paul Rees has a look at the Azzurri ... The Ireland team have an interesting trip around Rome on Saturday ... Italy: 15-Hayward, 14-Padovani, 13-Campagnaro, 12-Morisi, 11-Esposito, 10-Allan, 9- Tebaldi; 1-Lovotti, 2-Ghiraldini (capt), 3-Ferrari, 4-Ruzza, 5-Budd, 6-Tuivaiti, 7-Mbanda, 8-Steyn Replacements: 16-Bigi, 17-Traore, 18-Pasquali, 19-Sisi, 20-Zanni, 21-Guglielmo Palazzani, 22-McKinley, 23-Castello. Ireland: 15-Kearney, 14-Earls, 13-Farrell, 12-Aki, 11-Stockdale, 10-Sexton, 9-Murray; 1-Kilcoyne, 2-Cronin, 3-Furlong, 4-Dillane, 5-Roux, 6-O\u2019Mahony (capt), 7-O\u2019Brien, 8-Murphy Replacements: 16-Scannell, 17-McGrath, 18-Ryan, 19-Henderson, 20-Van der Flier, 21-Cooney, 22-Carty, 23-Conway. Good afternoon! Essentially we\u2019re all just here to see how points Ireland rack up against Italy. After an opening game loss to England, Ireland showed what they can do against Scotland and will be looking to build on that in Rome today. The last three fixtures between the two sides have worked out at an average score of 59-11 in favour of the Irish and it could be a similar walloping today if the Italians aren\u2019t careful. To make matters worse for the Italians, Sergio Parisse is absent due to concussion. They have lost all 12 Six Nations games under Conor O\u2019Shea, which is a sign of how badly they have been doing, leading some to call for them to be dropped from the competition entirely. Let\u2019s be honest, there is pretty much no chance of a shock on the cards today but let\u2019s try to enjoy the fun.",

      "bodyText": "Manchester United David de Gea: 7 Only routine saves to make as Liverpool, for all their possession, created little all afternoon. Ashley Young: 7 A poor back-passin the first minute could have been costly but proved his only error. Kept Man\u00e9 quiet. Chris Smalling: 7 Could have been the match-winning hero had he thrown himself at Lukaku\u2019s late cross. Effective in his natural position, however. Victor Lindel\u00f6f: 8 Continues to improve as a United defender. Perfectly placed to deal with every flicker of danger. Dominant. Luke Shaw: 8 Strong, calm and intelligent in his handling of Salah. Also dealt well with the overlapping runs of Milner. Ander Herrera: 4 Started the episode of \u201cCasualty\u201d when injuring himself while fouling Matip. More midfield bite left with him. Scott McTominay: 6 Deputised well for the injured Nemanja Matic. Risky to wrestle Wijnaldum and Matip in the box but otherwise mature. Paul Pogba: 6 Given little time or space by Henderson and passing not up to usual standards when he did break free. Juan Mata: 5 The second to depart injured after making a key tackle on Salah inside the area. Had started brightly. Romelu Lukaku: 4 Roused himself too infrequently for the crowd\u2019s liking. Had the tools to trouble Liverpool but reluctant to use them. Struggling. Marcus Rashford: 6 Provided his team\u2019s best outlet despite suffering from an early knock when fouled by Henderson. Understandably faded. Subs Andreas Pereira (for Herera, 20) 6; Jesse Lingard (for Mata, 25) 4; Alexis S\u00e1nchez (for Lingard, 42) 4. Liverpool Alisson: 8 Reacted superbly to smother Lingard\u2019s excellent chance having been previously unemployed. The mark of a top keeper. James Milner: 6 Chosen instead of Alexander-Arnold at right-back and prospered in the space outside Pogba. Jo\u00ebl Matip: 7 Spared a costly own-goal by an offside call against Smalling. Important presence at both ends of the pitch, however. Virgil van Dijk: 8 Returned from suspension to illustrate his value to Liverpool once again with a commanding display. Key headers denied Lukaku and Pogba. Andy Robertson: 6 A threat on the overlap only in the closing stages as United\u2019s formation, and Young, kept him in check. Jordan Henderson: 6 Shifted right to nullify Pogba and achieved that aim before being withdrawn to his obvious displeasure. Fabinho: 8 Ticked all the boxes in a central role \u2013 broke up play, passed well and was strong in the tackle and in the air. Georginio Wijnaldum: 6 Efficient and industrious as always, although unable to have his usual influence in the final third. Mohamed Salah: 5 Subdued by Shaw and on the receiving end of several ear-bashings by Klopp before being withdrawn. Roberto Firmino: 4 Had made an influential start when his ankle buckled playing a routine pass. Always a significant absentee. Sadio Man\u00e9: 5 Very quiet by his recent standards.

A lengthy extension of the negotiating period is gaining traction as the EU\u2019s default position should the Commons continue to reject May\u2019s deal, and a request emerge. Replacing the 21-month transition period with extra time as a member state would allow the UK and the EU to develop their plans for the future relationship with the aim of making the contentious Irish backstop redundant. Brussels is determined to avoid offering a short extension only to have to revisit the issue in the summer when the government again fails to win round parliament. \u201cIf leaders see any purpose in extending, which is not a certainty given the situation in the UK, they will not do a rolling cliff-edge but go long to ensure a decent period to solve the outstanding issues or batten down the hatches,\u201d one EU diplomat said. \u201cA 21-month extension makes sense as it would cover the multi-financial framework [the EU\u2019s budget period] and make things easier.

It is doing the rounds in Brussels corridors. Martin Selmayr [the European commission\u2019s secretary-general], among others, also fond of the idea.\u201d Exasperation with May\u2019s handling of Brexit is growing in Brussels as senior insiders put the chance of the UK crashing out without a deal at \u201cmore than 50%\u201d. Informed sources say there is dismay that senior government figures are focused on seeking domestic political advantage and appear wilfully blind to the opposition to reopening the withdrawal agreement. One insider said there was concern that there was no domestic consensus over the withdrawal agreement but also over the UK\u2019s position on what kind of trading relationship it wanted when the transition period elapsed. \u201cSome say: \u2018We can have Norway, we can have Canada, we can have a customs union, we can\u2019t have a customs union.

One senior EU diplomat said May was to blame for failing to confront hardline Eurosceptic Tories. \u201cShe gave the impression that you can stay in your delusional comfort zone, but you can\u2019t,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cUnless she is ready to choose there is nothing we can do.\u201d Concerns emerged as May flew in to the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheik for an EU-Arab league of states summit on Sunday, and confirmed she would not be putting a revised Brexit deal to the Commons this week. Even so she insisted that it \u201cwithin our our grasp to leave the EU by 29 March and that is what we are planning to do\u201d. May said she would instead put the deal to parliament on 12 March and brushed off the calls by three cabinet ministers \u2013 Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark \u2013 for a no-deal scenario to be ruled out. \u201cWhat we see around the cabinet table are strong views on the issue of Europe,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we are doing as a government is ensuring we are doing everything we can to leave the European Union with a deal. \u201cPeople are talking about the extension of article 50 as if it solves the issue when of course it won\u2019t. It defers the point of decision. There comes a point when we must make that decision.\u201d There is growing support, however, among MPs for an amendment due to be tabled this week by the former Labour and Conservative cabinet ministers Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin, which would instruct May to seek an extension of article 50 if she does not have a deal ratified by 13 March. As he arrived at the summit in Egypt, Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor, offered his support for a delay to Brexit given the impasse in the negotiations. \u201cIf by the beginning of March there\u2019s no support for the deal then I think it would be good to postpone Brexit because a no-deal scenario is bad for the EU but extremely bad for the UK,\u201d Kurz told reporters. EU officials are understood to be looking at options if such an extension request is received: a three-month \u201ctechnical\u201d extension to allow extra time for ratification if the parliamentary process develops positively, or a longer prolongation of nine to 21 months should there be no clear way to break the current impasse. A source close to the European council president, Donald Tusk, said that as a request had yet to be made by Downing Street, the issue had not been discussed by leaders. \u201cNo Tusk position on this,\u201d the official said of the mooted 21-month extension. \u201cAt this stage, at least.\u201d But sources said the EU was determined to avoid a series of three-month extension requests by the UK, which would cause damaging uncertainty, leaving Brussels unable to plan for the future. The emergence of the idea of a 21-month delay to Brexit will be seen by some as an attempt to push Brexiter MPs into backing May\u2019s deal. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barner, had advised ambassadors last week that the threat of a lengthy extension could be used by May as leverage in talks with her Brexiter MPs as she seeks to nudge the deal through parliament. May is meanwhile driving on with seeking legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement to reassure Brexiters of the temporary nature of the Irish backstop, which would keep the UK in a customs union to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. The prime minister updated Tusk during a 30-minute meeting at the summit in Egypt on her plans for the meaningful vote. \u201cNo tensions,\u201d an EU source said. \u201cFocus on practicalities.\u201d Tusk was said to have told May that the EU would have \u201cclarity that a proposal for the way forward can command a majority in the UK, before the issue is tackled by the European council\u201d. The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, who will hold talks with May on Monday in Egypt, dismissed claims made earlier on Sunday by Michael Gove, the environment secretary, that a time limit or unilateral exit mechanism from the Irish backstop could still emerge from the talks. \u201cA backstop that includes a time-limit is not a backstop at all. Nor would a unilateral exit clause work for us,\u201d Varadkar said.",

Job adverts posted by the recruitment firm Ellwood Atfield appear to confirm rumours of a merger between the Remote Gambling Association, which represents online betting firms, and the Association of British Bookmakers, which came in for heavy criticism during the battle over fixed-odds betting terminals. A senior industry source confirmed the shakeup, saying: \u201cAll of the issues on responsible gambling and tax cut across the industry, so it\u2019s time to get lined up a bit better.\u201d The plan comes as the industry faces the threat of new regulatory curbs following a string of scandals that have stoked public anger about the behaviour of gambling companies and their influence on policy. The advert is for a chairman and chief executive to shape the new body, which is called Newco at this stage. The advert says it will be \u201cthe largest and most prominent organisation representing the gambling industry\u201d. According to recruitment pages for both positions, candidates should be able to show that they have a \u201ctrack record of successfully influencing the political and lobbying process within Westminster, Whitehall and ideally Brussels\u201d. Applicants are also asked to display \u201can established network within the national and international political and media arena, with experience of dealing with the media on politically sensitive topics\u201d. The Association of British Bookmakers (ABB) fought hard against plans to place new restrictions on FOBTs, only for the government to brand the machines a \u201csocial blight\u201d and cut the maximum bet on the machines from \u00a3100 every 20 seconds to \u00a32. Prior to the decision, sports minister Tracey Crouch resigned in protest at what she saw as the influence of MPs with close ties to gambling lobbyists. An anti-FOBT campaigner, Matt Zarb-Cousin, said the creation of a new trade body indicated the industry\u2019s realisation that it had made a series of missteps. \u201cThis illustrates how discredited the ABB in particular are with policymakers and with government, given the way they handled the issue of FOBTs and their failure to acknowledge any kind of problem, which has led to resistance to any meaningful compromise. \u201cUltimately, the \u00a32 stake was enacted, their worst-case scenario, so it\u2019s no surprise they\u2019re looking for a new body to lead on this.\u201d While the FOBT battle is over, with the new reduced stakes due to be implemented from 1 April, attention has shifted to the dangers posed by online gambling, where stakes are often unlimited. Gambling apps on smartphones, which have surged in popularity in recent years, were deemed more dangerous than FOBTs in a study published this month in the academic journal European Addiction Research. Some of the industry\u2019s biggest names have been rocked by a series of scandals related to their failure to intervene to prevent problem gambling and money laundering. The level of financial penalties issued by industry regulator the Gambling Commission has risen steadily over the past few years, from \u00a35.2m in 2016 to \u00a310.75m the following year and \u00a328m in 2018. The Remote Gambling Association (RGA) and the ABB, the industry\u2019s two leading trade bodies, were said to be in merger talks late last year, but this was dismissed as \u201cunlikely\u201d by the RGA\u2019s former chief executive, Clive Hawkswood. It now appears that an overhaul of the industry\u2019s lobbying and advocacy architecture is imminent, with betting companies alarmed at the groundswell of public distrust and looming regulation. The government is considering banning betting on credit cards, while bookies could be forced to pay a mandatory tax to fund problem gambling treatment, as opposed to the voluntary levy in place at the moment. The Gambling Commission has also introduced measures forcing companies to do more to stop children gambling, while concern about the level of betting adverts on TV led the industry to agree to take voluntary steps to stop advertising around sports. The Guardian has approached the ABB and RGA for comment. Five gambling industry scandals \u2022 Ladbrokes agreed to pay \u00a31m to the victims of a problem gambler who had stolen the money he was using to bet, in return for a pledge not to inform the Gambling Commission. The case, revealed by the Guardian two months ago, resulted in the commission warning the industry about the use of non-disclosure agreements. \u2022 Sports minister Tracey Crouch resigned in protest at plans to delay the implementation of curbs on FOBTs. Her departure triggered a cross-party rebellion that forced the government into a U-turn rather than risk defeat on its own budget. - William Hill reached a \u00a36.2m settlement with the gambling industry regulator in 2018 for failing to protect consumers and prevent money laundering, a year after the betting firm 888 was hit with a record \u00a37.8m penalty. \u2022 Ladbrokes was investigated by the Gambling Commission over an allegation that staff watched a gambling addict take out payday loans to fund hundreds of pounds of bets on FOBTs. \u2022 The bookmaker Paddy Power was found to have encouraged a problem gambler to keep betting until he lost five jobs, his home and access to his children, according to a report by the Gambling Commission.",

It is also factoring in emissions reduction from Turnbull\u2019s pet project, the Snowy 2.0 expansion (which the Morrison government has not yet formally signed off on); energy efficiency measures; an electric vehicle strategy (that it has not yet unveiled); the rebadged climate solutions fund; additional hydro projects and just under 100Mt of abatement from \u201ctechnology solutions\u201d (which aren\u2019t specified) and \u201cother sources of abatement\u201d such as projects under development but not yet contracted. The government says examples of projects to be assisted under its rebadged ERF will include funding for remote indigenous communities to reduce severe bushfires in rural and remote areas; support for small business to replace lighting, air conditioning and refrigeration systems to help reduce energy costs; drought proofing on farms; and support for local communities to reduce waste and increasing recycling rates. Liberal MPs have been lobbying the leadership to pull together a package of climate measures, with many reporting a significant voter backlash about the Coalition\u2019s destructive record on climate policy. Strategists for both major parties report that after a summer characterised by extreme weather and prolonged heatwaves, voters are more concerned about climate change now than they have been at any time since 2007. Liberals are also under fire in their electoral heartland from small \u201cl\u201d liberal independents campaigning on the Coalition\u2019s poor record on climate change, highlighting past behaviour like cutting the renewable energy target and attempting to abolish agencies like the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Arena. Morrison will on Monday attempt a course correction, saying the government is committed to \u201cmeaningful, practical action on climate change, without damaging our economy or the family budget\u201d. \u201cWe will continue to play our part in meeting the global challenge of climate change in the 21st century,\u201d the prime minister will say. \u201cWe will do so without taking a sledgehammer to our economy. Without putting our electricity market at risk. Without putting pressure on electricity prices. Without destroying jobs in our traditional industries and in regional Australia. \u201cThis is the responsible and balanced course. And we must stay the course\u201d.",

The latest survey, published by the Australian on Sunday night, has Labor\u2019s primary vote on 39% and the Coalition\u2019s on 37%. The survey was taken at the tail end of a brutal parliamentary week, in which senior government figures were embroiled in controversies, ranging from the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, forgetting to pay for private travel arranged through a Liberal party office holder and donor, and Michaelia Cash facing a fresh barrage of criticism for failing to provide a witness statement to police investigating a leak from her office. Despite Labor maintaining a decisive lead in the major-party contest, Scott Morrison remains ahead of Bill Shorten as preferred prime minister 44% to 35%. Both leaders recorded movements within the margin of error when it came to voter disapproval. There was a three-point increase in disapproval of Morrison\u2019s performance and a two-point increase in disapproval of Shorten\u2019s. The two-party-preferred result in Newspoll has been steady since the beginning of the year, despite the Coalition intensifying its negative campaigning against Labor. With the political cycle reaching the business end, with an election to be called after the budget in April, the government has raised alarm bells about the opposition\u2019s economic policies, and has claimed that Labor is weakening Australia\u2019s border defences by supporting the medical evacuation bill in an attempt to get back into the political contest. The Guardian Essential poll has also recorded a two-party-preferred result of 53% to 47% in Labor\u2019s favour in the opening surveys of the year, with the poll a fortnight ago, in the wake of the final report of the banking royal commission, suggesting a stronger result for Labor of 55-45. A new poll is due this week. An Ipsos poll last week suggested Labor\u2019s lead had narrowed. The poll conducted for Nine\u2019s Sydney Morning Herald and the Age had the opposition leading the Liberal-National Coalition 51-49 on the two-party-preferred measure, down from 54-46 in December. That poll of 1,200 voters suggested Labor\u2019s primary vote had fallen from 37% to 33% over two months, while the Coalition\u2019s rose from 36% to 38%. With parliament now in recess until the budget, Morrison will begin the new week by unveiling a climate policy reboot in Melbourne in an attempt to shore up the Liberal heartland from incursions by small \u201cl\u201d liberal independents.",

As well as pressing on with its banking response, the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has told Scott Morrison the opposition intends to begin \u201cexercising its right to seek public service briefings\u201d under guidelines associated with the caretaker conventions. Shorten is invoking the guidelines on the rationale the government has telegraphed the election will be in May, and the parliamentary library has advised May 18 is the last date for a regular election of the House and half the Senate.

As well as attempting to keep the political focus on banking, which is safer political ground for Labor than the pre-election border protection war the Morrison government is seeking, Shorten has also flagged he will seek input from officials under guidelines related to the caretaker conventions. In a letter to the prime minister, Shorten says the guidelines \u201cfacilitate pre-election briefings between shadow ministers and officials from government departments and are intended to ensure a smooth transfer of power if an election results in a change of government\u201d. \u201cUnder the guidelines the leader of the opposition and shadow ministers are entitled to seek briefings with the public service in the period beginning three months from the expiry of the parliament, or the announcement of the election, whichever is sooner,\u201d Shorten says in the letter.

Or was the Brumbies\u2019 astonishing 54-17 win against the Chiefs in Canberra on Saturday night just another false dawn for the struggling code?</p> <p>Australia\u2019s Super Rugby teams failed to win a single game against New Zealand opposition in 2017 and won only four matches last year. But in the second round of the 2019 season, the Brumbies smashed the Kiwi hoodoo, raising hopes of a long-awaited revival of Australian rugby at Super Rugby and Test level.</p> <p>If the Brumbies can maintain this form, what are the implications for Australia\u2019s chances in Super Rugby and more importantly for the Wallabies at the World Cup in Japan? The Brumbies produced a superb display of total rugby, complementing their strong set-pieces and rolling maul with expansive, running rugby. And they did it without injured star openside flanker David Pocock. Their line-speed in defence and support play in attack were excellent. They showed no fear of the Chiefs and they never took their foot off their throats, very much a ruthless Kiwi trait.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/23/wales-england-six-nations-match-report\">Wales on course for grand slam as late tries shatter England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The spark for the Brumbies\u2019 win was the scintillating performance of five-eighth Christian Lealiifano, who capped off his comeback from cancer with a game that turned back the clock.

But how much notice will Wallabies coach Michael Cheika take of Super Rugby form?

      "bodyText": "February 23, 2019. Is this the date future rugby historians will pinpoint as the turning point for the game in Australia? Or was the Brumbies\u2019 astonishing 54-17 win against the Chiefs in Canberra on Saturday night just another false dawn for the struggling code? Australia\u2019s Super Rugby teams failed to win a single game against New Zealand opposition in 2017 and won only four matches last year. But in the second round of the 2019 season, the Brumbies smashed the Kiwi hoodoo, raising hopes of a long-awaited revival of Australian rugby at Super Rugby and Test level. If the Brumbies can maintain this form, what are the implications for Australia\u2019s chances in Super Rugby and more importantly for the Wallabies at the World Cup in Japan? The Brumbies produced a superb display of total rugby, complementing their strong set-pieces and rolling maul with expansive, running rugby. And they did it without injured star openside flanker David Pocock. Their line-speed in defence and support play in attack were excellent. They showed no fear of the Chiefs and they never took their foot off their throats, very much a ruthless Kiwi trait. The spark for the Brumbies\u2019 win was the scintillating performance of five-eighth Christian Lealiifano, who capped off his comeback from cancer with a game that turned back the clock. It was the best display by an Australian playmaker for several years. A strong Brumbies will give Australia a greater chance of contributing two teams to the Super Rugby playoffs, which in turn will help the Wallabies to prepare for the Bledisloe Cup, the Rugby Championship and the World Cup. But how much notice will Wallabies coach Michael Cheika take of Super Rugby form? Will he continue to rely on players who have performed for him in the past, particularly members of his 2014 Waratahs Super Rugby title-winning team? Significantly, when the Brumbies won the Australian conference title in 2016 and 2017, their dominance was not reflected in the selection of the Wallabies in the opening Test of the Bledisloe Cup series, the most important game of the year. In 2016 there were nine Waratahs (who finished sixth) in the Wallabies\u2019 23-man squad for the opener against the All Blacks in Sydney compared to seven Brumbies, including five to four in the starting line-up. Similarly, in 2017 there were eight Waratahs (who finished ninth) in the Wallabies\u2019 23-man squad for the Bledisloe Cup opener against the All Blacks in Sydney compared to the Brumbies\u2019 six, including five each in the starting line-ups, while ex-Waratahs hooker Tatafu Polota-Nau was playing for the Western Force. The Wallabies were thrashed by the All Blacks in both of those games. Was selection a contributing factor in those defeats? The new Wallabies selection panel of Cheika, Rugby Australia director of coaching Scott Johnson and dual international Michael O\u2019Connor will be crucial in ensuring outstanding Super Rugby form is transferred to the Test arena. The question is, will Johnson and O\u2019Connor be merely selection advisors or will they have the power to outvote Cheika? Intriguingly, under Rugby Australia\u2019s new power structure, Cheika will answer to Johnson, which effectively makes him head of the selection panel. The key for Johnson and O\u2019Connor is to help Cheika find the players who are best equipped to play the style of game the coach wants the Wallabies to play, but also make sure Super Rugby form is given a high priority. After two rounds it is way too early to make confident predictions about which Super Rugby team will win the Australian conference. With Will Genia and Quade Cooper running the show, the Melbourne Rebels looked fairly impressive, if not entirely convincing, in their 34-27 win against the Brumbies in Canberra in round one.

But the Waratahs \u2013 the team Cheika seems to rely on most - have had a slow start; their one-point win against the Sunwolves in Tokyo on Saturday more disappointing than their one-point loss to the Hurricanes at Brookvale Oval the previous week. On form the Brumbies should supply the majority of the Wallabies, but one game does not make a season. There is still a long way to go before the Bledisloe Cup opener against the All Blacks in Perth on August 10.

      "bodyText": "One of the great lessons of the 20th century is that history has no direction: as Isaiah Berlin and Karl Popper argued, and as the transformative upheavals of 1989 showed to thrilling effect, there is no secular version of providence, no ideological script to follow. So it has been alarming, in the past few years, to watch the two main parties surrendering to different versions of the teleological delusion. The Conservative party has embraced Brexit as a mythic nativist destiny towards which we must all march loyally. Labour, meanwhile, is in thrall to the old left determinism, in which all the core debates have long since been settled, devotion to the leadership must be absolute, and all that remains is for those who are foolish enough to think otherwise to be stripped of their false consciousness.

Henderson went through him in the first minute and that was just one of many fouls on him today. I was very concerned, but he\u2019s a warrior and he\u2019s a Manc, and he knows what this means. We had to keep him on, because we\u2019d already used three subs.</p> \n   <p>You come out with so many positives today. The fans, they were the 11th man today because we had half a Marcus. I can\u2019t remember David having to make a save. We kept them out of it and we created a couple of chances where we could have scored.</p> \n   <p>We\u2019ve lost a few with muscle injuries, hamstrings. But we\u2019ve got some good kids coming through. We\u2019ll have 11 players on the pitch on Wednesday night as well.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c72c450e4b0ac8d72de760d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-24T16:24:42.422Z\">4.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>J\u00fcrgen Klopp says he isn\u2019t frustrated.

That obviously cost us rhythm. In the end we have to admit that United played with a completely new midfield, a pretty much new three up front, but we lost the rhythm and we couldn\u2019t get it back. It was a game without a lot of highlights. It was intense of course, but for sure it\u2019s for United a point they won and for us we lost two. When United is beatable you have to do it, and we didn\u2019t do it. I\u2019m not frustrated. I\u2019ll always take what I get from the boys. It doesn\u2019t feel world class at the moment but it\u2019s OK, we have a point more.</p> \n   <p>We didn\u2019t play a lot of wonderful football. It was not flexible enough. The build-up from deep was OK, but then of course you need to keep the ball in the right areas, you need to shoot, and we didn\u2019t do these things often enough.</p> \n   <p>Look, form and confidence, in football you can work for it. Luck you can work for. Everything you can work for in football, but you really have to try. The attitude of the boys is not questioned, but keep cool, pass the ball around, go into the right areas.

It is not often that a domestic cup final can rationally be considered the second most interesting game of the day but while Manchester City are distracted by the Carabao Cup final against Chelsea, their title rivals have the chance to vault above them, perhaps permanently. Defeat for Liverpool at Old Trafford obviously would not be fatal, but victory this afternoon would be a significant stride towards glory. After this all of Liverpool\u2019s away games are against sides currently in the bottom half of the table, and besides next Sunday\u2019s Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, all of them are against teams currently in the bottom six. At home, meanwhile, they are unbeaten all season.</p> \n  <p>United though are unbeaten in the league since their visit to Anfield in December, for what turned out to be Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s final match in charge. United have taken 25 points from their nine league games since then, five more than Liverpool and four more than City and Tottenham, who have both played a game more. Since that day they Liverpool have won two of four league away games, scoring only five times (United have scored 12 from five away matches), and looked generally unconvincing.</p> \n  <p>In short, United have to be the favourites to win this match, and to land a painful blow upon their great rivals. Liverpool haven\u2019t won at Old Trafford since 2014, but will feel they need to get something from this trip. It is all tremendously exciting, a match to savour. Thanks for being here. Let\u2019s do this.</p> \n </div> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s all from me. It\u2019s been, to be frank, a bit disappointing. Hopefully the Carabao Cup final will make up for it \u2013 follow it with Nick Ames, now, here: Here\u2019s Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s response. He says Lingard, Mata and Herrera all have hamstring injuries: You\u2019ve always got to be ready for everything, but losing three players in the first half with hamstring injuries, and probably we should have taken Marcus off as well. Henderson went through him in the first minute and that was just one of many fouls on him today. I was very concerned, but he\u2019s a warrior and he\u2019s a Manc, and he knows what this means. We had to keep him on, because we\u2019d already used three subs. You come out with so many positives today. The fans, they were the 11th man today because we had half a Marcus. I can\u2019t remember David having to make a save. We kept them out of it and we created a couple of chances where we could have scored. We\u2019ve lost a few with muscle injuries, hamstrings. But we\u2019ve got some good kids coming through. We\u2019ll have 11 players on the pitch on Wednesday night as well. J\u00fcrgen Klopp says he isn\u2019t frustrated. However, he certainly sounds frustrated: It was a strange game. We started really well, and then the injury crisis started as well. That obviously cost us rhythm. In the end we have to admit that United played with a completely new midfield, a pretty much new three up front, but we lost the rhythm and we couldn\u2019t get it back. It was a game without a lot of highlights. It was intense of course, but for sure it\u2019s for United a point they won and for us we lost two. When United is beatable you have to do it, and we didn\u2019t do it. I\u2019m not frustrated. I\u2019ll always take what I get from the boys. It doesn\u2019t feel world class at the moment but it\u2019s OK, we have a point more. We didn\u2019t play a lot of wonderful football. It was not flexible enough. The build-up from deep was OK, but then of course you need to keep the ball in the right areas, you need to shoot, and we didn\u2019t do these things often enough. Look, form and confidence, in football you can work for it. Luck you can work for. Everything you can work for in football, but you really have to try. The attitude of the boys is not questioned, but keep cool, pass the ball around, go into the right areas. That could have happened more often, but obviously not today. Here\u2019s Jamie Jackson\u2019s match report from Old Trafford: \u201cWhy was an own goal subject to the offside rule?\u201d wonders Devesh Sharma. It was the United player, who got onto the end of the free kick and turned the ball back across goal, who was offside. Anything after that was irrelevant. Here\u2019s James Milner\u2019s hot take: I\u2019d say a clean sheet is pleasing, it\u2019s not an easy place to come. We made all the running, didn\u2019t create as many chances as we\u2019d have liked. We go into every game to win, but hopefully it\u2019s a good point at the end of the season. We\u2019ll only know after 38 games. I don\u2019t think we were good enough with our movement. Around the box we couldn\u2019t open them up as often as we\u2019d like. They\u2019re a confident team at the moment and they\u2019re well organised, but with the players we\u2019ve got we\u2019d have liked to have created more opportunities. We want to win every game, no matter who it\u2019s against, and we know we can. So when you come off and you haven\u2019t won it\u2019s always disappointing. We\u2019ve got to look where we can improve when we\u2019ve got the ball and teams are sat back. That\u2019s something we have to adapt to and work out how to break down. United impressed again, though. As the injuries piled up in the first half, with Liverpool dominating possession, their motivation could also have been damaged. Instead it never wavered, and they were defensively resolute throughout. Luke Shaw was named man of the match, after popping Mo Salah into his pocket and keeping him there. \u201cIt seems Klopp made the decision to attack Shaw\u2019s flank the entire day and failed to adapt to the fact that the United left back can actually play a bit,\u201d surmises Johnathan Kaszynski. So Liverpool return to the top of the table, but that was a really poor performance. United defended well, but were rarely stretched. Watford visit Anfield on Wednesday, and the search for a momentum-building, confidence-boosting display of thrilling attacking brio from the title-chasers will have to wait until then. Or later. 90+2 mins: The match ends with Liverpool passing the ball around the halfway line before finally, desperately, tossing it into the area. United head clear, and the final whistle blows! 90+1 mins: There will be just two minutes of stoppage time. 90+1 mins: Lukaku\u2019s left-footed cross from the right flies across the area and Smalling, at the far post, doesn\u2019t throw himself at the ball when he might have turned it in. Goal kick. 90 mins: Liverpool win another free kick, but Milner\u2019s delivery is headed clear. United break but Wijnaldum fouls Young just beyond the half-way line, and is booked. 88 mins: Robertson\u2019s cross looks vaguely dangerous, but the only way Sturridge feels he can get to it is by shoving a defender, and United have a free kick. 87 mins: Shaqiri, who could perhaps have created something, has spent almost all his time wide on the right and not got anywhere near goal. 85 mins: Liverpool have had no brightness and invention around the penalty area. Their front three have been either injured or rubbish, and Man\u00e9\u2019s attempt to play in Robertson ends in a goal kick. 83 mins: Shaqiri deliberately brings down Rashford as United try to counter, and accepts a booking in return. 82 mins: This half United\u2019s set-piece delivery has been excellent, but their forwards repeatedly offside. Liverpool\u2019s set-piece delivery has been poor, and this one is easily cleared. 81 mins: Young is booked for tripping Milner on the right flank. Liverpool\u2019s only shot on target all game was Sturridge\u2019s hopeless 40-yarder in the 33rd minute. 79 mins: Liverpool make their final substitution, bringing on Origi and taking off Salah, who has done pretty much nothing all game. 79 mins: Liverpool still don\u2019t really have an attacking strategy beyond getting the ball to their full-backs and hoping their crosses lead to something. Robertson\u2019s cross leads to a corner. 75 mins: United have the ball in the net, but it\u2019s disallowed for offside! Again it\u2019s from a free kick, which Shaw lifts into the area. It\u2019s send back across goal and turned into his own net by Matip, but the flag is up! 73 mins: Liverpool go 4-2-3-1, with Salah up front just ahead of Sturridge, and Man\u00e9 and Shaqiri on the flanks. 72 mins: Liverpool make their second change, bringing Shaqiri on for Henderson. 71 mins: The second corner finds Matip, who was being pulled by McTominay and heads over. He wasn\u2019t being pulled very hard, and should probably have just committed to the header rather than thinking about potential penalties. 70 mins: Chance for Liverpool! Milner wins, and takes, a corner, which arrows towards Wijnaldum. But he misses his header, and the ball bounces off McTominay and out of play. 68 mins: The atmosphere is incredible, the tempo is remarkable, but the quality just isn\u2019t there at the moment. 66 mins: A shot! It\u2019s a terrible one, Wijnaldum blasting over from the edge of the area, but a shot all the same. 65 mins: Liverpool control the ball for a while, but when Henderson tries to lift it into United\u2019s area it\u2019s immediately smashed clear. \u201cThere was better possession football in Cardiff yesterday,\u201d sniffs Paul Fitzgerald. 63 mins: Henderson hits the ball long towards Man\u00e9, and Smalling easily wins the header and turns it back to De Gea. Their over-use of long balls is not helping them. 61 mins: United have upped the pace in this half, and have had the better of the play. Liverpool have not put together a passing move of any length or purpose. Another one comes to an early end with Man\u00e9 misplacing a pass to McTominay. 57 mins: United get numbers forward, and Lukaku has four people to aim for with his cross from the right, but it doesn\u2019t quite drop for any of them, and Rashford eventually shoots wide from an unlikely angle. 56 mins: United play the ball over the top for Rashford, but his first touch is poor and Alisson gathers. 55 mins: The atmosphere seems to have increased in intensity since the interval, while United \u2013 albeit entirely from set pieces \u2013 have been more dangerous. It smells like there\u2019s a goal coming. 54 mins: It\u2019s half-cleared to Salah, who heads down to Van Dijk, who volleys back into the mixer. Young wins it there, despite Matip kicking at him from behind, and United get a free kick. 53 mins: Liverpool finally find some space in attack, Henderson running down the right, but his low cross is cut out. Corner. 53 mins: Another United free kick and another free header. This time S\u00e1nchez gets his head to the ball, but he too is offside. Still, a double warning for Liverpool. 51 mins: Fabinho trips McTominay and from the free kick Young lifts the ball into the area and Pogba runs free but heads at Alisson, and is anyway offside. 49 mins: \u201cThis feels like a Shaqiri kind of game; someone to do something unexpected for Liverpool,\u201d suggests Hubert O\u2019Hearn, and if Liverpool do have someone who is going to unlock United, he doesn\u2019t seem to be on the pitch. \u201cIt won\u2019t do Sturridge\u2019s remaining confidence any favours, but I think he\u2019s the one to go. Hope no more injuries or they\u2019ll be setting up M*A*S*H tents on the touchline.\u201d 48 mins: United have everyone in defence. Van Dijk plays the ball right to Matip, who plays the ball back to Van Dijk, who \u2013 with everyone in front of him covered by a red shirt \u2013 goes back to his goalkeeper. 47 mins: Matip very nearly gives the ball away to S\u00e1nchez on the halfway line, but just about recovers. 46 mins: Man\u00e9 tries to backheel Salah into space in the United penalty area, but the ball is cut out. 46 mins: They\u2019re off! The players retake the field. All appear to be able to walk. 45+5 mins: And that\u2019s it, for now. Both teams head for the dressing-rooms to lick their wounds. \u201cMore Red Cross than Red Devils,\u201d says Martin Tyler of the first half. \u201cYou know what they say,\u201d writes JR. \u201cFootball is a simple game where 22 men run around chasing a ball and at the end of the game there are 14 men left chasing the ball. This is farcical.\u201d 45+4 mins: There have been three shots on target in the first half, and four substitutions. 45+1 mins: Into stoppage time. There\u2019s been about four minutes of it, the referee decides. 45 mins: S\u00e1nchez crosses from the left but Robertson puts his body in the way of Lukaku\u2019s run and the Belgian\u2019s header is easily saved. Lukaku then lands on top of Robertson\u2019s left shoulder, and the physios are back on. 44 mins: Liverpool win a corner, which Matip heads over. The injuries have stopped either team developing a rhythm in this first half, but there will certainly be fewer in the second period, so that\u2019s something. 42 mins: Lingard is limping to the touchline, and Alexis S\u00e1nchez is replacing him. 42 mins: Lingard has gone down now, and looks in real pain. 40 mins: What a stop from Alisson! Pogba runs down the left and then passes across the area, 25 yards from goal, to Lukaku. The Belgian picks out Lingard\u2019s run into the box with a fantastic pass, but Alisson comes out to palm the ball away as the United player tries to push it around him. 39 mins: Matip makes another run into the penalty area from open play, and gets his head to the ball once he\u2019s in there. He nods it out towards Milner, who lets it cross the line before he volleys in a cross. 37 mins: Pogba curls a shot towards the far corner from the left side of the penalty area, but Van Dijk heads it away from goal, and then does the same from the resulting corner. 36 mins: Milner is in so much space so often it\u2019s almost as if United have made a deliberate decision to let him roam the right flank, hoping that Liverpool will take that easy option instead of giving the ball to their more dangerous players in more constricted areas. If that is their tactic, it\u2019s working pretty well. 33 mins: Liverpool have had 62% of the first-half possession, but have not really tested De Gea. Rashford meanwhile appears to have run off his early knock, and is currently fastened to the left touchline. 33 mins: Sturridge has a shot from at least 40 yards, which trundles along the ground straight to De Gea. 31 mins: Another Milner cross goes nowhere, and the ball is cleared for a throw-in. Roberto Firmino, who is shown landing awkwardly on his ankle as he heads for the touchline, is replaced by Daniel Sturridge. Liverpool need to turn their domination into goals, or at least chances. 28 mins: It looks like another substitution is about to take place, and this time it\u2019s Firmino who seems to be on his way off. Sturridge appears to be J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s pick to replace him. 27 mins: Milner\u2019s crossing has been dismal so far, and he sends another effort looping straight out of play. 25 mins: Lingard comes on for Mata. Salah will be wondering how he failed to beat an injured Mata when Liverpool broke a couple of minutes ago, with only the Spaniard between him and goal. 24 mins: Mata is limping now, and Lingard is getting ready to come on. This is remarkable. Liverpool have the physios on the pitch at the moment, Firmino apparently unhappy. 23 min: The corner is cleared and Liverpool counter, but Salah is dispossessed by Mata on the edge of the area and Milner is then booked for stopping United\u2019s counter-counter by tripping Pogba. 22 mins: United attack, with Rashford doing well to keep the ball on the left and play it back to Pogba, whose cross is tailored for Lukaku but headed away by Van Dijk. Corner. 21 mins: Liverpool have looked by a margin the more threatening team in this opening period, and United\u2019s players appear to be falling apart. They win a corner, but Van Dijk\u2019s header loops harmlessly to De Gea. 21 mins: Herrera is off, and Pereira on. 20 mins: While Herrera receives treatment Rashford goes towards the bench for a drink. Solskjaer comes out to ask if he needs to come off. The answer isn\u2019t clear, but it looked like a shake of the head. 19 mins: Now it looks like United have two injuries, with Herrera on the ground and rubbing his right hamstring. 18 mins: Marcus Rashford is still limping. It now looks like Andreas Pereira might replace him. 17 mins: Liverpool work the ball well down the left, and Robertson\u2019s low cross from the byline would have given anyone at the far post a tap-in. There\u2019s nobody at the far post. 17 mins: It\u2019s 2-0 at the Emirates, where Mkhitaryan has doubled Arsenal\u2019s lead over Southampton. 16 mins: Salah\u2019s free kick is pretty dreadful, and floats way over the bar. 15 mins: Matip rips through the heart of the United midfield and is taken out by Herrera just before he gets into the penalty area. This is a superb shooting chance, from a metre outside the box. 14 mins: Rashford is limping, and Lingard is warming up. 12 mins: Liverpool have been repeatedly pinging long balls crossfield to Milner on the right. Nothing much has come of it yet, but it\u2019s definitely a thing. 11 mins: United give the ball away in defence but Liverpool\u2019s attack seemed slightly half-hearted, and ended with a weak pull-back by Man\u00e9. 10 mins: Liverpool attack down the right but get boxed into a narrow strip of pitch near the corner flag and eventually misplace a pass. United throw-in. 8 mins: There\u2019s already been a goal at Arsenal, where Lacazette has but the Gunners 1-0 up against Southampton. \u201cI se that we are being denied MBMery on the crunch Southampton v Arsenal no-pointer,\u201d notes Charles Antaki. \u201cShame, as I was looking forward to more chat about the perennial favourites of Why No Ozil? Is Koscielny Crocked Again? When Will Arsenal Actually Beat Anyone Half-Decent? And, for balance, Where Did It All Go Wrong For Oriol Romeu? But perhaps it\u2019s better to sit back and hear about the latest deb\u00e2cle in audio only.\u201d 7 mins: At the other end Salah\u2019s lovely jinking, twisting run into the United penalty area ends with his hard, low cross hitting a defender\u2019s leg and, the sting having been taken from it, rolling to De Gea. 7 mins: Rashford, picked out by Young\u2019s lovely early pass, falls over while shooting from the edge of the area, and the ball loops to Alisson. 6 mins: Salah spins and sets off on a foot race against Luke Shaw, which the United left-back narrowly wins. 5 mins: Liverpool play the ball around for a bit, before eventually getting it to Salah, 10 yards outside the area. He has two defenders upon him before the ball is under control, and is swiftly dispossessed. 2 mins: Henderson taps it to Fabinho, who rolls it to Milner, all of which tippy-tapping gives the United defence a chance to rush forward and block the shot when it comes. 1 min: Nearly a chance for Liverpool! Robertson plays the ball down the line and Ashley Young, under no pressure, rolls the ball back towards De Gea \u2013 but it looks like Firmino will get there first! He pulls out of the challenge, strangely, and De Gea gets a hand to it \u2013 indirect free kick! 1 min: They\u2019re off! Juan Mata taps the ball backwards, and we\u2019re under way. Preambles over, it\u2019s time for action. United will kick off, any moment now. Before the game, a minute\u2019s applause for the former Manchester United youth coach, Eric Harrison. Here\u2019s his side in FA Youth Cup-winning action: And out they come! Happily Liverpool are leaving their cramped dressing room now, as the players gather in the tunnel. Dressing-room latest. It looks a bit cramped in here: Some manager chat. First Solskjaer on Matic\u2019s absence, and the decision to bring in mcTominay to replace him: It\u2019s a big blow. he\u2019s had a muscle injury so he\u2019ll be out for a few weeks. One of these things that happen during a season. We\u2019ll just have to manage without. Nemanja with his experience and his performances has been vital for us in midfield, but Scott has played these games before, he\u2019s got bags of energy and he\u2019s a local boy who knows these games. How, he\u2019s asked, can United win this game? Quality in what we\u2019re doing. Concentration. And control the emotions on the pitch. Then J\u00fcrgen Klopp is asked why Trent Alexander-Arnold is not playing. He says it is with future games in mind, which I\u2019m far from convinced by: We have games coming up. I don\u2019t like thinking about the games coming up but it\u2019s the first moment we could make the decision. We will need Trent vrey much in the next few weeks. So all good. That\u2019s the reason. Of course not because of last year. Absolutely no reason. Then he\u2019s asked if his team\u2019s first job will be to quieten the home crowd: I don\u2019t think about quietening the crowd. We want to have a result here. That\u2019s the plan. If you get a result you have to perform and if you perform the crowd is not the loudest. We don\u2019t think about atmosphere. We are used to big atmospheres of course. We\u2019ve played big games. We just want to work for a result. We want to deserve a result. And if we deserve it then we\u2019ll take it. Pre-match reading: here\u2019s a bit from Barney Ronay on Marcus Rashford: \u201cBeing a cowardly Liverpool fan I have volunteered to take my daughter out rather than watch the game (it\u2019s lovely here in Berlin too),\u201d writes Tim Woods. \u201cKlopp and others are of course correct that today\u2019s result won\u2019t decide the title, but I do feel Liverpool have been lacking a big statement win/performance this season. The result at Spurs was good (and no I don\u2019t count beating Arsenal at home). A win today, whether deserved, hard-fought or lucky, could be the thing to kick-start a return to form for the last 11 games. Hopefully.\u201d There\u2019s another 2.05pm Premier League kick-off. Here are the teams from Arsenal v Southampton: Arsenal: Leno, Lichtsteiner, Mustafi, Papastathopoulos, Kolasinac, Torreira, Xhaka, Iwobi, Ramsey, Mkhitaryan, Lacazette. Subs: Cech, Koscielny, Ozil, Aubameyang, Monreal, Suarez, Guendouzi. Southampton: Gunn, Bednarek, Vestergaard, Stephens, Valery, Hojbjerg, Romeu, Ward-Prowse, Targett, Armstrong, Redmond. Subs: McCarthy, Yoshida, Austin, Elyounoussi, Bertrand, Slattery, Obafemi. Referee: Graham Scott. An update on Matic\u2019s injury: Solskjaer has told MUTV that he will be out for a couple of weeks, after an injury sustained in training. United play five times in the next 15 days, with fixtures after today against Crystal Palace (a), Southampton (h), Paris St-Germain (a) and Arsenal (a). And here\u2019s a bit of Solskjaer on United: Here\u2019s a bit of J\u00fcrgen Klopp on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: The big news for Liverpool: Trent Alexander-Arnold, who struggled at Old Trafford last season, is left on the bench with James Milner preferred at right-back. Fabinho, Wijnaldum and Henderson start together in midfield for the first time. The big news for United: Nemanja Matic has a muscle injury, and Scott McTominay comes in to make his third league start of the season. Jesse Lingard is back from injury to take a place on the bench, but Anthony Martial is out. Team news is in, and this is it: Man Utd: De Gea, Young, Smalling, Lindelof, Shaw, Ander Herrera, McTominay, Pogba, Mata, Lukaku, Rashford. Subs: Bailly, Sanchez, Lingard, Andreas Pereira, Fred, Dalot, Romero. Liverpool: Alisson, Milner, Matip, van Dijk, Robertson, Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Keita, Sturridge, Lallana, Mignolet, Shaqiri, Origi, Alexander-Arnold. Referee: Michael Oliver. It is just the most glorious day in Manchester, and much of the country. Team news imminent. Something to note for later: Hello world! The Big One. It is not often that a domestic cup final can rationally be considered the second most interesting game of the day but while Manchester City are distracted by the Carabao Cup final against Chelsea, their title rivals have the chance to vault above them, perhaps permanently. Defeat for Liverpool at Old Trafford obviously would not be fatal, but victory this afternoon would be a significant stride towards glory. After this all of Liverpool\u2019s away games are against sides currently in the bottom half of the table, and besides next Sunday\u2019s Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, all of them are against teams currently in the bottom six. At home, meanwhile, they are unbeaten all season. United though are unbeaten in the league since their visit to Anfield in December, for what turned out to be Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s final match in charge. United have taken 25 points from their nine league games since then, five more than Liverpool and four more than City and Tottenham, who have both played a game more. Since that day they Liverpool have won two of four league away games, scoring only five times (United have scored 12 from five away matches), and looked generally unconvincing. In short, United have to be the favourites to win this match, and to land a painful blow upon their great rivals. Liverpool haven\u2019t won at Old Trafford since 2014, but will feel they need to get something from this trip. It is all tremendously exciting, a match to savour. Thanks for being here. Let\u2019s do this.",

      "bodyText": "If Liverpool wished to signal serious intent of ending their 29-year wait to be champions of England, they failed. This game in hand over Manchester City featured an under-par performance that will hearten Pep Guardiola\u2019s men, though the point does leave the Merseyside club leaders by a point with 11 matches left. The draw suits Manchester United far better and given how Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s XI were hindered by three injury-enforced substitutions, all before the interval, the result is a particular morale-booster. The Norwegian may have overhyped United\u2019s second-half display as \u201cmagnificent\u201d but they certainly outplayed Liverpool then and though J\u00fcrgen Klopp played down his disappointment, he will be concerned that his team failed to fire. The sight of Klopp appearing near-furious throughout \u2013 \u201canimated\u201d was his description \u2013 and choosing to take off his star turn Mohamed Salah with 11 minutes remaining summed up how Liverpool stuttered. Solskj\u00e6r made two changes from Monday\u2019s FA Cup win at Chelsea. Sergio Romero returned to the bench and Nemanja Matic was injured so in came David de Gea and Scott McTominay. Jesse Lingard\u2019s recovery from a hamstring problem was advanced enough for him to sit on the bench but Anthony Martial was absent because of his groin injury. Klopp also changed two from Tuesday\u2019s Champions League draw with Bayern Munich; James Milner and Virgil van Dijk for Trent Alexander-Arnold and Naby Ke\u00efta. In what would end as a dire, injury-blighted 45 minutes, Liverpool rattled United instantly from kick-off. Ashley Young\u2019s back-pass left De Gea short and in desperation the goalkeeper handled the ball. The referee gave the indirect free-kick outside the six-yard area to the right. A short routine ended with a Milner pot-shot hitting the wall and United escaped. Much of Liverpool\u2019s possession was down to United errors. The next meant Jo\u00ebl Matip received the ball and ran through the home side, causing Ander Herrera to shove him over inside the D, and United were relieved to see Salah spoon the free-kick over. Herrera\u2019s act might have been the reason he was forced off on 21 minutes \u2013 the Spaniard replaced by Andreas Pereira. Given Matic\u2019s absence this meant United now had a third-choice in midfield alongside the second-choice McTominay, Paul Pogba being the only automatic selection left on the field in that position. Further injury problems occurred moments later when Juan Mata had to come off, though Lingard\u2019s entrance meant United were arguably strengthened. All this disrupted any rhythm the contest had \u2013 a point Klopp used to explain his team\u2019s performance. And there was more: just after the half-hour Roberto Firmino became the match\u2019s third substitution because of a sore ankle that brought Daniel Sturridge on. Sturridge\u2019s first contribution was a 30-yard pea-roller though this was, at least, some form of attacking act; it would prove Liverpool\u2019s sole attempt on target. As the interval neared United moved up a gear, putting together the contest\u2019s best move. Pereira intercepted in his half and found Romelu Lukaku. He played in Pogba down the left, who ran on before returning the ball to the No 9.

      "bodyText": "What does Theresa May mean when she says MPs won\u2019t get a \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 this week? When the government\u2019s flagship Brexit bill, the Withdrawal Act, was passing through parliament, MPs wrung a promise from the government that they would be given the chance to approve Theresa May\u2019s deal in what became known as a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d. They have had one chance to do that so far, on 16 January, when they rejected her painstakingly negotiated agreement by a thumping majority of 230. She has since been on a diplomatic charm offensive, holding meetings and phone calls with EU leaders and senior officials in a bid to convince them to make legally binding changes to the most contentious part of her deal, the Irish backstop. At the same time, ministers and officials have been talking to Labour MPs who might consider backing her deal, in exchange for concessions on issues including workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards. As she said on her way to Sharm El Sheikh, however, she does not yet have a new deal to put to the House of Commons. So will MPs not now get the chance to vote on Brexit this week? They will get to vote, but not yet on a reworked Brexit deal. After her historic loss in January, May promised to renegotiate the deal and bring it back to parliament for MPs to approve in another meaningful vote. Under the terms of an amendment to the Withdrawal Act drawn up by Dominic Grieve, however, ministers also had to come back to the Commons within a set deadline, set out what they planned to do next and give MPs the chance to influence government policy by tabling and voting on amendments. There have been two such series of votes since January. In the first, on 28 January, two amendments were passed . One called for \u201calternative arrangements\u201d to the Irish backstop and the other rejected a no-deal Brexit. When Theresa May came back to parliament again on Valentine\u2019s Day and asked MPs to reaffirm those two amendments, she suffered an embarrassing defeat after a rebellion by the backbench European Research Group (ERG). That day, she promised to put another motion before MPs to be voted on this Wednesday if she had not managed to strike a fresh deal by then. So the government will table a motion this week, probably a fairly anodyne one, and MPs will get to table amendments on it and vote on them. The most likely crunch-point is a no-deal Brexit. Will May\u2019s pledge of another meaningful vote by 12 March quell the rebellion in her cabinet? No. Deep divisions in the cabinet over how to manage Brexit burst into the open this week, with three ministers \u2013 Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark \u2013 saying in a statement published in the Daily Mail on Saturday that if a breakthrough could not be achieved \u201cin the next few days\u201d then the article 50 notice period for leaving the EU must be extended. May is now promising to bring her deal back to parliament for a second meaningful vote on 12 March, just 17 days before Britain is due to leave the EU. The comments by Rudd, Gauke and Clark suggested they were ready to join the string of ministers who have signalled that they are prepared to defy party whips in order to back the Cooper-Letwin amendment. Due to be tabled this week by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper and the former Tory minister Oliver Letwin, the amendment would force the government to make time available to pass a bill requesting an extension to article 50 if parliament has not agreed a deal by mid-March. MPs will vote on the amendment on Wednesday, and it now looks highly likely to pass. Will MPs get the chance to vote for a second Brexit referendum this week? Perhaps not. The Liberal Democrats have said they will table a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d amendment, but the Speaker may not select it without wider cross-party support. Much of the action in seeking to secure a referendum currently centres around an amendment tabled by Phil Wilson and Peter Kyle calling on MPs to back May\u2019s deal in exchange for a public referendum to ratify it. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said on Sunday there was a \u201chigh possibility\u201d Labour might support a reworked version of the amendment \u2013 but it would not be tabled this week, only with the deal itself, when May brings it back for another meaningful vote on 12 March.",

The Academy has received considerable criticism in recent years for the perceived white/male/elderly bias of its voters \u2013 and a drive to create a more diverse membership was instituted after the #OscarsSoWhite campaign in 2016.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many Oscars are there and how does a film get nominated?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There are 24 categories \u2013 ranging from best picture to best sound mixing \u2013 presented on Oscar night. The Academy also gives out a bunch of Scientific and Technical awards: this year, for example, it will honour the people behind Adobe Photoshop and the Medusa Performance Capture System. Also there are the honorary Oscars: this year they are going to actor Cicely Tyson, producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, Steven Spielberg's PR flack Marvin Levy and composer Lalo Schifrin (of Mission: Impossible renown).</p>\n    <p>Each of the main awards has its own rules and regulations for slimming down all the eligible entries \u2013 first to a longlist, then a shortlist, then the final nomination list. In most categories, to be eligible a film must have been released for seven days in Los Angeles before 31 December, and a specialist committee makes the selection for the nomination \u2013 which is then voted on by the full membership. For the best foreign language film award, each country can submit one film (89 were put forward this year), before a committee boils them down to a final five.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do Oscar winners win?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Oscar statuette isn't solid gold:&nbsp;it's gold-plated bronze on a black metal base. It is 34 cm tall and weighs 3.8 kg. While the Academy doesn't own it once it is handed over, its acceptance is conditional that recipients won't sell them unless they have offered them back to the Academy for $1.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Best actress</h2> \n<p>Glenn Close (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/12/the-wife-review-glenn-close-brilliant-toronto-film-festival-tiff-2017\">The Wife</a>) <br>Lady Gaga (A Star Is Born)<br>Olivia Colman (The Favourite) <br>Melissa McCarthy (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/10/can-you-ever-forgive-me-review-melissa-mccarthy\">Can You Ever Forgive Me</a>?)<br>Yalitza Aparicio (Roma)</p> \n<h2>Best supporting actor</h2> \n<p>Mahershala Ali (Green Book)<br>Richard E Grant (Can You Ever Forgive Me?)<br>Sam Elliott (A Star Is Born) <br>Adam Driver (BlacKkKlansman) <br>Sam Rockwell (Vice)</p> \n<h2>Best supporting actress</h2> \n<p>Emma Stone (The Favourite)<br>Rachel Weisz (The Favourite)<br>Amy Adams (Vice)<br>Regina King (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/10/if-beale-street-could-talk-review-barry-jenkins-tragic-romance-soars\">If Beale Street Could Talk</a>)<br>Marina De Tavira (Roma)</p> \n<h2>Best adapted screenplay</h2> \n<p>If Beale Street Could Talk (Barry Jenkins) <br>A Star Is Born (Bradley Cooper, Will Fetters and Eric Roth)<br>Can You Ever Forgive Me?

      "body": "<p>Comedy Central, Channel 4, Rolling Stone: whenever there\u2019s a poll of the greatest comedians of all time, you\u2019ll find Bill Hicks haunting the top 10. The stature of the Texan, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/26/bill-hicks-obituary-john-lahr\">died of pancreatic cancer in 1994</a>, has grown and grown, with each posthumous DVD release or docu-hagiography stoking the legend of the fearless prophet-comic bellowing truth to power. This, we were told, was standup as it should be: revolutionary in intent, rock\u2019n\u2019roll in spirit \u2013 and not for the faint-hearted.</p> <p>It helped with the too-hot-to-handle mythology that Hicks was a prophet without honour in the US, where audiences stayed away and his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2y9uZwf6CQ\">final guest-slot</a> on Late Night with David Letterman was cut. And it helped \u2013 morbidly enough \u2013 that he died at just 32. All those routines deploring sell-outs and squalid compromises retained their power because this Kurt Cobain of standup never had the chance to betray his lofty principles in middle age.</p> <p>Then there are the memories of those who were there at the time, particularly in Britain, which took Hicks to its heart in the early 90s. Those who caught him live will never forget the excitement he generated. It was a moment: comedy was the new rock\u2019n\u2019roll, remember. And Hicks \u2013 dressed in black, wearing a cowboy hat, with a cigarette permanently dangling from his lips \u2013 crystallised it, regularly selling out 2,000-seat theatres in London\u2019s West End.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f9b681bb657d74b8216149ab8f38593a98aae6f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9b681bb657d74b8216149ab8f38593a98aae6f6/293_0_1200_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It felt very reminiscent of the era\u2019 \u2026 Kemah Bob.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It felt very reminiscent of the era\u2019 \u2026 Kemah Bob.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBut these days,\u201d says the standup <a href=\"http://avalonuk.com/clients/chloe-petts/\">Chloe Petts</a>, \u201cif someone came on stage with that energy, you\u2019d think, \u2018Oh my God, you\u2019re an arsehole!\u2019 Don\u2019t you think?\u201d I\u2019m talking to Petts on the 25th anniversary of Hicks\u2019s death, curious to know what a generation of comics \u2013 all born after he died \u2013 make of his work.

It\u2019s the things that got Hicks wound up: advertising, marketing, capitalism, and how they captured and sullied all things good. A generation later, advertising is the air we breathe, our selves are our product. It\u2019s harder \u2013 for comedians and everyone else \u2013 to imagine how life could ever be otherwise.

Plenty of his material is sexually explicit, and some is sexually violent, like the revenge fantasy (trigger warning) about an ex-girlfriend now married to a 600lb welder who \u201cmakes love to her with a broom handle at night\u201d before drowning her in his vomit. Says Bob: \u201cNo matter how much you say, \u2018All right, let\u2019s time travel and put myself in the headspace of a fan\u2019, there\u2019s still some stuff that\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, OK, this is <em>so</em> not 2019!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Here\u2019s the problem. \u201cThese days,\u201d says Petts, \u201cif an angry white guy stands in front of an audience spouting his opinions like they\u2019re 100% fact, people will be quite alarmed.\u201d In the 90s, that was standup\u2019s most romanticised mode. Today \u2013 in an era much more alert to privilege, gender and cultural politics \u2013 it\u2019s not such a good look, especially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/02/too-soon-rehabilitate-louis-ck-mockery-metoo\">after Louis CK\u2019s behaviour</a>. To Petts, who is the co-founder of queer comedy collective The Lol Word, Hicks is \u201clike mansplaining from start to finish. And we\u2019re a bit bored nowadays of that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"026fb7d00851b576844da93eb311466402d4393e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/026fb7d00851b576844da93eb311466402d4393e/191_2325_3435_3435/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rob Oldham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He kicks down an awful lot\u2019 \u2026 Rob Oldham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s not just Petts\u2019 and Bob\u2019s take: some straight white guys think the same. Rob Oldham\u2019s debut show Worm\u2019s Lament was well received at the Edinburgh fringe last year. Anachronisms apart, Petts and Bob both admire Hicks\u2019s comedy, considering him, in Bob\u2019s words, \u201ca nice dude\u201d. Not so Oldham, who sees Hicks as unpleasant, hypocritical \u2013 and not as radical as he\u2019s cracked up to be.</p> <p>Again, it\u2019s the toxic masculinity that\u2019s off-putting. \u201cIn his \u2018Goat Boy\u2019 character,\u201d says Oldham, \u201che revels in these paedophilic sketches. When he wants to disparage Rick Astley, it\u2019s about having no dick as opposed to Jimi Hendrix\u2019s big dick. Then there\u2019s his repeated references to rape as a moral punishment. For a supposed critical voice, who doesn\u2019t follow all the other sheep, how on Earth did he not realise he was recycling a violent patriarchal trope which has been the bedrock of an oppressive system for thousands of years?\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s more. \u201cHe kicks down an awful lot. The fall people are always women, gay people, Iraqis. His routines deliver devastating one-liners to members of the hospitality industry.\u201d Take the famous \u201cWhat are you reading <em>for</em>?\u201d routine, in which Hicks recalls being asked this question by a waffle waitress, who becomes the butt of the joke. The problem, says Oldham, is that Hicks is quick to criticise Americans, society, the government, but seldom himself. \u201cSomething that\u2019s truly radical needs to take a look at itself.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/video/2014/feb/21/bill-hicks-religious-cults-video-standup\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/3nvdf\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2047398\"            data-video-name=\"Bill Hicks on religious cults - exclusive video\"            data-video-provider=\"Half Life Films\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/2/20/1392907684813/Bill-Hicks-standup-religi-017.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-430350065\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/2/20/1392907684813/Bill-Hicks-standup-religi-017.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/02/20/140220BillHicks-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/02/20/140220BillHicks/140220BillHicks.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/02/20/140220BillHicks_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/02/20/140220BillHicks.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/02/20/140220BillHicks_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/video/2014/feb/21/bill-hicks-religious-cults-video-standup\">Bill Hicks on religious cults - exclusive video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>For all its blind spots, however, Hicks seems to me more self-conscious, and more concerned with social justice, than Oldham gives him credit for.

      "bodyText": "Comedy Central, Channel 4, Rolling Stone: whenever there\u2019s a poll of the greatest comedians of all time, you\u2019ll find Bill Hicks haunting the top 10. The stature of the Texan, who died of pancreatic cancer in 1994, has grown and grown, with each posthumous DVD release or docu-hagiography stoking the legend of the fearless prophet-comic bellowing truth to power. This, we were told, was standup as it should be: revolutionary in intent, rock\u2019n\u2019roll in spirit \u2013 and not for the faint-hearted. It helped with the too-hot-to-handle mythology that Hicks was a prophet without honour in the US, where audiences stayed away and his final guest-slot on Late Night with David Letterman was cut. And it helped \u2013 morbidly enough \u2013 that he died at just 32. All those routines deploring sell-outs and squalid compromises retained their power because this Kurt Cobain of standup never had the chance to betray his lofty principles in middle age. Then there are the memories of those who were there at the time, particularly in Britain, which took Hicks to its heart in the early 90s. Those who caught him live will never forget the excitement he generated. It was a moment: comedy was the new rock\u2019n\u2019roll, remember. And Hicks \u2013 dressed in black, wearing a cowboy hat, with a cigarette permanently dangling from his lips \u2013 crystallised it, regularly selling out 2,000-seat theatres in London\u2019s West End. \u201cBut these days,\u201d says the standup Chloe Petts, \u201cif someone came on stage with that energy, you\u2019d think, \u2018Oh my God, you\u2019re an arsehole!\u2019 Don\u2019t you think?\u201d I\u2019m talking to Petts on the 25th anniversary of Hicks\u2019s death, curious to know what a generation of comics \u2013 all born after he died \u2013 make of his work. And it turns out the answer is: not so much. Kemah Bob, a compatriot of Hicks, runs the Femmes of Colour (FOC It Up) Comedy Club in London. She\u2019d never watched his work before I contacted her for this article, and found doing so a hoot. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Who smokes? All right! Now I\u2019m talkin\u2019 \u2019bout drugs. You know what I hate? The war on drugs. You know what I love? Sex. And rock\u2019n\u2019roll.\u2019 It felt very reminiscent of the era.\u201d It\u2019s not just the rock\u2019n\u2019roll stylings that seem quaint. It\u2019s the things that got Hicks wound up: advertising, marketing, capitalism, and how they captured and sullied all things good. A generation later, advertising is the air we breathe, our selves are our product. It\u2019s harder \u2013 for comedians and everyone else \u2013 to imagine how life could ever be otherwise. Bob seems to be understating things when she says: \u201cSelling out has evolved in meaning.\u201d Bob\u2019s biggest beef with Hicks, though, is that \u201che gets a bit misogynist\u201d. Plenty of his material is sexually explicit, and some is sexually violent, like the revenge fantasy (trigger warning) about an ex-girlfriend now married to a 600lb welder who \u201cmakes love to her with a broom handle at night\u201d before drowning her in his vomit. Says Bob: \u201cNo matter how much you say, \u2018All right, let\u2019s time travel and put myself in the headspace of a fan\u2019, there\u2019s still some stuff that\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, OK, this is so not 2019!\u2019\u201d Here\u2019s the problem. \u201cThese days,\u201d says Petts, \u201cif an angry white guy stands in front of an audience spouting his opinions like they\u2019re 100% fact, people will be quite alarmed.\u201d In the 90s, that was standup\u2019s most romanticised mode. Today \u2013 in an era much more alert to privilege, gender and cultural politics \u2013 it\u2019s not such a good look, especially after Louis CK\u2019s behaviour. To Petts, who is the co-founder of queer comedy collective The Lol Word, Hicks is \u201clike mansplaining from start to finish. And we\u2019re a bit bored nowadays of that.\u201d That\u2019s not just Petts\u2019 and Bob\u2019s take: some straight white guys think the same. Rob Oldham\u2019s debut show Worm\u2019s Lament was well received at the Edinburgh fringe last year. Anachronisms apart, Petts and Bob both admire Hicks\u2019s comedy, considering him, in Bob\u2019s words, \u201ca nice dude\u201d. Not so Oldham, who sees Hicks as unpleasant, hypocritical \u2013 and not as radical as he\u2019s cracked up to be. Again, it\u2019s the toxic masculinity that\u2019s off-putting. \u201cIn his \u2018Goat Boy\u2019 character,\u201d says Oldham, \u201che revels in these paedophilic sketches. When he wants to disparage Rick Astley, it\u2019s about having no dick as opposed to Jimi Hendrix\u2019s big dick. Then there\u2019s his repeated references to rape as a moral punishment. For a supposed critical voice, who doesn\u2019t follow all the other sheep, how on Earth did he not realise he was recycling a violent patriarchal trope which has been the bedrock of an oppressive system for thousands of years?\u201d There\u2019s more. \u201cHe kicks down an awful lot. The fall people are always women, gay people, Iraqis. His routines deliver devastating one-liners to members of the hospitality industry.\u201d Take the famous \u201cWhat are you reading for?\u201d routine, in which Hicks recalls being asked this question by a waffle waitress, who becomes the butt of the joke. The problem, says Oldham, is that Hicks is quick to criticise Americans, society, the government, but seldom himself. \u201cSomething that\u2019s truly radical needs to take a look at itself.\u201d For all its blind spots, however, Hicks seems to me more self-conscious, and more concerned with social justice, than Oldham gives him credit for. But Oldham\u2019s critique does point to something about our times \u2013 which is that identity is all and the only experience anyone pronounces upon with authority is their own. The heightened self-awareness of a comic like, say, Stewart Lee is much more fashionable than Hicks\u2019s presumption in dissecting and diagnosing the whole world. So have we lost faith in comedians as preachers, prophets or harbingers of The Truth? \u201cHicks\u2019s whole shtick is, \u2018Don\u2019t believe what the government tell you, man\u2019,\u201d says Oldham. \u201cYet his audience are engaging with him as a single voice that can tie all the questions up for them.

While the bank originally suggested that it had discovered the issue itself, it later emerged that the error was caught by the UK regulator.</p> <p>The debacle sent its shares plunging 50%, falling from around \u00a322 per share to a record low of \u00a310.87 within days of the disclosure on 23 January.

      "bodyText": "Metro Bank sees itself as an industry agitator, having burst on to the UK banking scene in 2010 with an eccentric American founder, dog-friendly branches and a flamboyant celebration of high street expansion that distinguished the lender from cost-cutting rivals. The bank \u2013 which calls its customers \u201cfans\u201d\u2013 has steadily expanded its network of \u201cstores\u201d and rallied enthusiasm for new openings with street parties and staff conga lines that have fostered a reputation for having a cult-like workforce. It has also dodged shareholder rebellions over multimillion pound payments to the architecture business of Shirley Hill, the wife of founder turned chairman Vernon Hill, and brushed off concerns about the circumstances of his departure from the US lender Commerce Bancorp. But 10 years on from its founding, the bank is steeling itself for a grilling over an accounting blunder. Metro Bank revealed last month that hundreds of millions of pounds of commercial property loans and loans to commercial buy-to-let operators had been wrongly classified in risk terms, and should have been among its \u201crisk-weighted assets\u201d (RWAs). While the bank originally suggested that it had discovered the issue itself, it later emerged that the error was caught by the UK regulator. The debacle sent its shares plunging 50%, falling from around \u00a322 per share to a record low of \u00a310.87 within days of the disclosure on 23 January. The price has since risen above \u00a314 \u2013 further helped by news on Friday that it had clinched the biggest award to date from a \u00a3775m scheme meant to boost competition in the banking sector following Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s state bailout in 2008. But investors are still jittery. The chairman, who has golfed with Donald Trump and often has his Yorkshire Terrier in tow, and the chief executive, Craig Donaldson, are understood to have spoken privately with shareholders following the accounting blunder. But this Wednesday will mark the first opportunity for investors, analysts and media to question Metro Bank\u2019s leadership openly about the gaffe. It is likely to overshadow a full-year earnings report that is expected to show profits surging from \u00a315.9m to \u00a339m, according to consensus estimates collected by Reuters. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cIt looks like the initial mistake was genuine, but it still clearly raises questions about Metro\u2019s capabilities, and the profitability of the loans it\u2019s been making under the wrong assumptions. The mischaracterisation of the way the error was uncovered, though, compounded the issue, and further erodes trust in the bank.\u201d John Cronin, a financial analyst at the stockbroker Goodbody, admitted that he was \u201cnervous\u201d heading into this week\u2019s earnings results, which could signal a further slowdown in growth and prompt a further share sell-off. \u201cThere will be a major focus on what levers the management team is planning to pull to minimise capital raising needs, as well as get the business back on track to deliver double-digit returns for shareholders, in line with their stated targets \u2013 which have been called into question now,\u201d he said. But the bank has been riding high in recents weeks. As well as Friday\u2019s award of \u00a3120m to help to develop its business banking proposition, a customer survey by the Competition and Markets Authority showed that Metro Bank ranking highest for personal account services.

Robert Hannigan was in charge of Britain\u2019s surveillance agency for just over two years between 2014 and 2017. His resignation in January 2017 came out of the blue and surprised security observers. Hannigan, then 51, suggested that he wanted to prioritise his family. In his resignation letter he said his 20-year career as a public servant had \u201cdemanded a great deal of my ever patient and understanding family and now is the right time for a change in direction\u201d.

      "body": "<p>When Dolly Parton was 19, instead of the frankly unbelievable 73 she is now, she and a girlfriend travelled from Tennessee to New York City. But, because this was her first proper trip to the city, it was one of the rare times in her life when she didn\u2019t have a clear sense of where she was or where she wanted to go. And so they ended up in what she describes today as \u201ca bad area\u201d. \u201cI think we were on 52nd Street and, because I looked like a tramp \u2013 a country girl, all overdone and tacky \u2013 this man thought I was a prostitute,\u201d she recalls today, her signature blond bouffant bouncing with her giggles. But 19-year-old Parton, even when lost in the big city, was unflappable. When the man wouldn\u2019t leave her alone she whipped out a little pistol her father had given her in case of emergencies: \u201cIf you touch me one more time, you\u2019ve had it!\u201d she shouted.</p> <p>The man disappeared into midtown Manhattan, but the encounter was later immortalised in Parton\u2019s first, and probably most enduring movie, the 1980 feminist classic 9 to 5. It is used in the scene that establishes Parton\u2019s character, when she takes a gun out of her purse, points it at her sexist boss, Mr Hart (Dabney Coleman), and tells him if he doesn\u2019t stop harassing her she will turn him \u201cfrom a rooster to a hen with one shot\u201d.</p> <p>It is also, like all anecdotes Parton tells about herself, calculated to fit her superbly crafted and universally adored image. The story makes her sound homespun, but worldly; sexy, but self-mocking; sassy, but safe. Whatever your gender or political persuasion, you are going to enjoy a story about Parton pulling a gun on a catcaller, and Parton knows that \u2013 which is why she tells it with such relish. You don\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.axs.com/news/dolly-parton-honored-for-100-million-albums-sold-13398\" title=\"\">sell more than 100m albums</a> without knowing how to play to all the seats in the house.</p> <p>I meet Parton in a London hotel on a Saturday morning. Even though she spent all of yesterday doing back-to-back TV interviews, and has another day of them lined up today, the septuagenarian is as perky as a daisy, as brightly coloured as a Matisse. The writer of solid-gold classics such as Jolene and I Will Always Love You is dressed in a very characteristic outfit of skintight striped trousers, which show off her pocket-sized bottom-half proportions, a clinging ribbed polo neck, which shows off her differently proportioned top half, fingerless silver leather gloves, gigantic rings, even more gigantic earrings and high heels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1ff5182d4c678204524dfbc3256aaf936a8ea95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1ff5182d4c678204524dfbc3256aaf936a8ea95/212_0_3297_1978/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda in 9 to 5.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda in 9 to 5.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know one thing or another about fashion, but people know I\u2019m gonna dress the way I dress, and it suits me,\u201d she says. And she is right, which is why she has dressed pretty much exactly the same way for half a century. Even aside from her clothes, with her perfectly smooth skin and Barbie-like figure, she also looks identical to when I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/aug/21/dolly-parton-country-music\" title=\"\">last met her, eight years ago, in Nashville</a> (and the same definitely cannot be said of me). Nonetheless, after Parton is told about our previous encounter, she insists without a pause: \u201cI thought your face looked familiar!\u201d In no way can this be true, but Parton without good southern manners is as unimaginable as her suddenly deciding to go brunette.</p> <p>The reason we are meeting today is that the 9 to 5 musical, based on the film, which Parton wrote the songs for, is opening in London. There has also been talk of Parton, Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin reuniting to make a sequel to the original movie, and when Parton confirms this is true I am not ashamed to admit that I squeal.</p> <p>Some have argued that 9 to 5, with its story of three women taking vicious revenge on their male boss, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/19/is-9-to-5-really-a-feminist-movie\" title=\"\">is too cartoonish to be taken seriously</a>. I can only assume these people were never sexually harassed themselves because what the movie lacks in intricate feminist arguments, it more than makes up for in being a supremely satisfying howl of rage against sexism, an over-the-top response to an over-the-top situation. It is all the more pleasing coming from Parton, who may look like a lurid male fantasy, but has always shown more mettle than meekness. She is, after all, the woman who stood up to the notoriously fearsome Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis Presley\u2019s manager, and refused to sign away half the publishing rights to I Will Always Love You when Presley wanted to record the song in the 70s. This proved to be a pretty canny move 20 years later, when Whitney Houston covered the song and made Parton millions.</p> <p>Reviving 9 to 5 now is a no-brainer because of the mood of the moment. Fonda has gone as far to say that workplace harassment is <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2018/07/jane-fonda-9-to-5-sequel-metoo-men-scared-tca-1202433558/\" title=\"\">worse today than it was in 1980</a>, but Parton is surely closer to the truth when she says: \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s always been bad. It\u2019s just that with the #MeToo movement women are bolder to speak out against it.\u201d</p> <p>Parton has to tread a careful line here because, while she may be adored by women happy to call themselves feminists, her core fanbase of southern Republicans has a rather more sceptical approach to the cause. They\u2019re all for a woman standing up for herself on a sketchy New York street \u2013 and with a gun, even better! \u2013 but any sloganeering or talk of structural sexism would be frowned on. So, although she is sweetly keen to fly the flag for a movie she made almost 40 years ago, all discussions of the movie\u2019s message are tempered with platitudes that will soothe any nervous male egos.</p> <p>Surely, I say, she must have experienced sexual harassment in her career. \u201cI have, but I have always been able to manoeuvre because I come from a family of six brothers, so I understand men and I\u2019ve known more good men than bad men. It\u2019s a man\u2019s world, and it\u2019s not their fault any more than it is just life and \u2026 we have allowed it to happen. I think people now see that we\u2019re here, and women are very important, and they need us, just as we need the men. But if someone was getting real aggressive with me, I\u2019d scream or throw something at them. But, of course, I\u2019ve been hit on \u2013 I\u2019ve probably hit on some people myself!\u201d</p> <p>Despite the fact that she has starred in two of the greatest women\u2019s movies ever (9 to 5 and Steel Magnolias), when I ask if she is a feminist she wrinkles her nose: \u201cI don\u2019t think \u2026 I mean, I must be if being a feminist means I\u2019m all for women, yes. But I don\u2019t feel I have to march, hold up a sign or label myself. I think the way I have conducted my life and my business and myself speaks for itself. I don\u2019t think of it as being feminist. It\u2019s not a label I have to put on myself. I\u2019m just all for gals,\u201d she says.</p> <p>It\u2019s not exactly a surprise that a 73-year-old woman from Tennessee would shy away from the f-word, but it does make me wonder why she agreed to be in such an overtly feminist movie to begin with. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t think about it in those terms, to be honest with you. I was thinking more in terms of business than subject matter. Jane was a big star and so was Lily, so I thought: \u2018This is great. If it\u2019s a big movie, I can share the glory, and if it\u2019s a flop it will be on them,\u2019 and Jane said: \u2018Well, Dolly will give us [audiences in] the south,\u2019\u201d she says.</p> <p>Parton\u2019s 9 to 5 co-stars have always been more than happy to shout about feminism, and they very nearly caused her to topple off her careful tightrope when the three of them appeared together<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZfrZcC4Kwg\" title=\"\"> at the 2017 Emmy awards.</a> \u201cBack in 1980, when we made that movie, we refused to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying hypocritical bigot \u2026\u201d Fonda began. \u201c\u2026 And it\u2019s true in 2017 we still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot,\u201d Tomlin finished. Parton\u2019s eyes widened in what looked very much like alarm at this obvious shot at Donald Trump, and she quickly changed the subject with a joke about her breasts and \u201ca shoutout to Dabney Coleman out there\u201d. I tell her she didn\u2019t look very happy up on stage that night, and she jumps in before I even finish.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2461ea552e6bba8f9ef5608ad00d19d249113fd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2461ea552e6bba8f9ef5608ad00d19d249113fd6/0_0_2842_1705/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018If I\u2019ve got something to say, I\u2019ll say it \u2026\u2019 With Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda at the 2017 Emmys.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If I\u2019ve got something to say, I\u2019ll say it \u2026\u2019 With Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda at the 2017 Emmys.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CBS via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t like being part of \u2026 I don\u2019t like to be known by the company I keep, so to speak. I want to be my own individual self. If I\u2019ve got something to say, I\u2019ll say it, but I don\u2019t want to be dragged into it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>So she was surprised by what they said? \u201cIt was a little \u2026\u201d she begins, then stops herself. \u201cWell, it was not a surprise, knowing Lily and Jane. I just did not want everybody to think that whatever they think is what I think. I don\u2019t really like getting up on TV and saying political things. I don\u2019t even want to make a deal out of it, but I want people to know I\u2019m my own individual self. Even though [Fonda, Tomlin and I] may agree on a whole lot of things \u2013 and they may have more agreement [between] themselves because they\u2019ve been together for longer \u2013 I still have my own thoughts and my own way of doing things. It\u2019s not a matter of being disrespectful, it\u2019s just, OK, that\u2019s what they said, I\u2019m not getting involved in it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Is that a personal preference or for the sake of her career?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s for both. I\u2019ve got as many Republican friends as I\u2019ve got Democrat friends and I just don\u2019t like voicing my opinion on things. I\u2019ve seen things before, like the Dixie Chicks. You can ruin a career for speaking out,\u201d she says, referring to the backlash that group suffered after they spoke out in 2003 against the Iraq invasion. \u201cI respect my audience too much for that, I respect myself too much for that. Of course I have my own opinions, but that don\u2019t mean I got to throw them out there because you\u2019re going to piss off half the people.\u201d</p> <p>And even when she doesn\u2019t say anything she can still piss people off. After the Emmys, Parton\u2019s Facebook page was filled with messages from her fans, furious that she had been (an admittedly silent) part of <a href=\"https://eu.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2017/09/18/dolly-parton-center-emmys-most-anti-trump-moment/676883001/.\" title=\"\">Fonda and Tomlin\u2019s anti-Trump protest</a>. Reactions were similarly virulent the year before when <a href=\"https://eu.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2016/07/04/dolly-parton-ll-certainly-behind-president-hillary-clinton/86668568/\" title=\"\">Parton seemed to endorse Hillary Clinton</a>, with the supremely cautious quote: \u201cI personally think a woman would do a great job [as president]. I think Hillary\u2019s very qualified. So, if she gets it, I\u2019ll certainly be behind her.\u201d Parton later had to issue a statement saying she endorsed neither Trump nor Clinton, and chucked in an inevitable breast joke to lighten the mood. (\u201cI might as well run myself because they could always use more boobs in the race.\u201d) So who can blame her for preferring to avoid controversy? I tell her that I remember seeing her on Oprah in the 90s, during the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal, when Parton said she couldn\u2019t disapprove of the president because he reminded her of her brothers.</p> <p>\u201cYeah! I know those men. In every man I see someone in my family,\u201d she says brightly.</p> <p>So does she see her brothers in Trump?</p> <p>\u201cI ain\u2019t talking about Trump!\u201d she shoots back sharply. Some subjects are too controversial for even Parton to neutralise.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All of us knew Lily Tomlin was gay for years, I\u00a0didn\u2019t know she wasn\u2019t actually out</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Parton was born and raised in a one-room cabin in the Great Smoky mountains in East Tennessee. Her extraordinary rise from the depths of deep-south poverty to the pinnacle of celebrity is so well known it is close to being a myth, thanks in no small part to Parton\u2019s own songs about her life, such as Tennessee Homesick Blues and Coat of Many Colors. She is enormously skilled at appearing to share details about her personal life without actually divulging very much. She makes frequent reference to her husband, Carl Dean, but no one has seen her with him for decades. Her physical appearance has always seemed to me like a metaphor for her actual person: she gives a lot of good \u2013 and distracting \u2013 front, but the reality is definitely obscured.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s some big mystery, I just know you can\u2019t just \u2026 I\u2019m just private, put it that way,\u201d she says. \u201cEven though I\u2019m public, there\u2019s still a very private side. But that\u2019s what keeps me sane, and I guess it\u2019s what keeps people intrigued \u2013 they think they\u2019re going to find out something more. But you\u2019re only going to know as much as I\u2019m going to tell you.\u201d</p> <p>One of the things many people have tried to find out is if Parton is gay. The rumours stem from her closeness to her childhood friend, Judy Ogle, who often accompanies her on tours instead of her husband. Parton\u2019s uncharacteristically political stance on gay rights, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-13/dolly-parton-on-same-sex-marriage,-childrens-literacy/9045788\" title=\"\">such as speaking out in defence of gay marriage</a>, have also fuelled rumours, all of which Parton has always laughingly denied. Last time we spoke, she said simply, when I asked about Ogle: \u201cVery few people know what it\u2019s like to have a very best friend and keep that best friend all your life.\u201d</p> <p>Tomlin came out in 2013 at the age of 74, having waited until her mother died to confirm the long-swirling rumours. Did Parton know Tomlin was gay when they made 9 to 5?</p> <p>\u201cLily? Of course! All of us knew Lily was gay for years, I didn\u2019t know she wasn\u2019t actually out. But I know that her mother was a southern woman and a lot of people don\u2019t accept it, and a lot of people have suffered their whole lives because they can\u2019t be who they are, and I understand that, too.\u201d</p> <p>Parton doesn\u2019t blink when I follow this by asking if Ogle is with her on this trip.</p> <p>\u201cOgle is usually with me, but she broke her hip, so she\u2019s not on this trip. But yes, usually she travels with me. So for now I\u2019m on my own,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Parton became famous in an era when it was taken for granted that celebrities would conceal, as opposed to today when they are expected to reveal all. Never would Parton post a photo of herself on social media without full makeup, <a href=\"https://www.dailyedge.ie/jane-fonda-slept-in-gown-3802086-Jan2018/\" title=\"\">as Fonda did last year. </a>(\u201cI thought it was cute, but no, never!\u201d)</p> <p>Parton\u2019s work ethic is extraordinary, but the real proof of her stamina is her public persona, which she maintains as indefatigably as her makeup. The night before we meet, a friend at the BBC texted me to say she happened to meet Parton in a corridor, and she got \u201cthe full Dolly Parton experience\u201d: southern aphorisms, boob jokes, sunny friendliness. Does she never get tired of having to be \u201cDolly Parton\u201d for everybody?</p> <p>\u201cNo, I enjoy what I do,\u201d she says firmly. \u201cI enjoy being loved \u2013 I love that. I always ask God to let me shine a light and uplift mankind because that is my purpose. I look fake, but my world is real to me.\u201d</p> <p><em>9 to 5 the Musical is now on at the Savoy theatre, London</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "When Dolly Parton was 19, instead of the frankly unbelievable 73 she is now, she and a girlfriend travelled from Tennessee to New York City. But, because this was her first proper trip to the city, it was one of the rare times in her life when she didn\u2019t have a clear sense of where she was or where she wanted to go. And so they ended up in what she describes today as \u201ca bad area\u201d. \u201cI think we were on 52nd Street and, because I looked like a tramp \u2013 a country girl, all overdone and tacky \u2013 this man thought I was a prostitute,\u201d she recalls today, her signature blond bouffant bouncing with her giggles. But 19-year-old Parton, even when lost in the big city, was unflappable. When the man wouldn\u2019t leave her alone she whipped out a little pistol her father had given her in case of emergencies: \u201cIf you touch me one more time, you\u2019ve had it!\u201d she shouted. The man disappeared into midtown Manhattan, but the encounter was later immortalised in Parton\u2019s first, and probably most enduring movie, the 1980 feminist classic 9 to 5. It is used in the scene that establishes Parton\u2019s character, when she takes a gun out of her purse, points it at her sexist boss, Mr Hart (Dabney Coleman), and tells him if he doesn\u2019t stop harassing her she will turn him \u201cfrom a rooster to a hen with one shot\u201d. It is also, like all anecdotes Parton tells about herself, calculated to fit her superbly crafted and universally adored image. The story makes her sound homespun, but worldly; sexy, but self-mocking; sassy, but safe. Whatever your gender or political persuasion, you are going to enjoy a story about Parton pulling a gun on a catcaller, and Parton knows that \u2013 which is why she tells it with such relish. You don\u2019t sell more than 100m albums without knowing how to play to all the seats in the house. I meet Parton in a London hotel on a Saturday morning. Even though she spent all of yesterday doing back-to-back TV interviews, and has another day of them lined up today, the septuagenarian is as perky as a daisy, as brightly coloured as a Matisse. The writer of solid-gold classics such as Jolene and I Will Always Love You is dressed in a very characteristic outfit of skintight striped trousers, which show off her pocket-sized bottom-half proportions, a clinging ribbed polo neck, which shows off her differently proportioned top half, fingerless silver leather gloves, gigantic rings, even more gigantic earrings and high heels. \u201cI don\u2019t know one thing or another about fashion, but people know I\u2019m gonna dress the way I dress, and it suits me,\u201d she says. And she is right, which is why she has dressed pretty much exactly the same way for half a century. Even aside from her clothes, with her perfectly smooth skin and Barbie-like figure, she also looks identical to when I last met her, eight years ago, in Nashville (and the same definitely cannot be said of me). Nonetheless, after Parton is told about our previous encounter, she insists without a pause: \u201cI thought your face looked familiar!\u201d In no way can this be true, but Parton without good southern manners is as unimaginable as her suddenly deciding to go brunette. The reason we are meeting today is that the 9 to 5 musical, based on the film, which Parton wrote the songs for, is opening in London. There has also been talk of Parton, Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin reuniting to make a sequel to the original movie, and when Parton confirms this is true I am not ashamed to admit that I squeal. Some have argued that 9 to 5, with its story of three women taking vicious revenge on their male boss, is too cartoonish to be taken seriously. I can only assume these people were never sexually harassed themselves because what the movie lacks in intricate feminist arguments, it more than makes up for in being a supremely satisfying howl of rage against sexism, an over-the-top response to an over-the-top situation. It is all the more pleasing coming from Parton, who may look like a lurid male fantasy, but has always shown more mettle than meekness. She is, after all, the woman who stood up to the notoriously fearsome Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis Presley\u2019s manager, and refused to sign away half the publishing rights to I Will Always Love You when Presley wanted to record the song in the 70s. This proved to be a pretty canny move 20 years later, when Whitney Houston covered the song and made Parton millions. Reviving 9 to 5 now is a no-brainer because of the mood of the moment. Fonda has gone as far to say that workplace harassment is worse today than it was in 1980, but Parton is surely closer to the truth when she says: \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s always been bad. It\u2019s just that with the #MeToo movement women are bolder to speak out against it.\u201d Parton has to tread a careful line here because, while she may be adored by women happy to call themselves feminists, her core fanbase of southern Republicans has a rather more sceptical approach to the cause. They\u2019re all for a woman standing up for herself on a sketchy New York street \u2013 and with a gun, even better! \u2013 but any sloganeering or talk of structural sexism would be frowned on. So, although she is sweetly keen to fly the flag for a movie she made almost 40 years ago, all discussions of the movie\u2019s message are tempered with platitudes that will soothe any nervous male egos. Surely, I say, she must have experienced sexual harassment in her career. \u201cI have, but I have always been able to manoeuvre because I come from a family of six brothers, so I understand men and I\u2019ve known more good men than bad men. It\u2019s a man\u2019s world, and it\u2019s not their fault any more than it is just life and \u2026 we have allowed it to happen. I think people now see that we\u2019re here, and women are very important, and they need us, just as we need the men. But if someone was getting real aggressive with me, I\u2019d scream or throw something at them. But, of course, I\u2019ve been hit on \u2013 I\u2019ve probably hit on some people myself!\u201d Despite the fact that she has starred in two of the greatest women\u2019s movies ever (9 to 5 and Steel Magnolias), when I ask if she is a feminist she wrinkles her nose: \u201cI don\u2019t think \u2026 I mean, I must be if being a feminist means I\u2019m all for women, yes. But I don\u2019t feel I have to march, hold up a sign or label myself. I think the way I have conducted my life and my business and myself speaks for itself. I don\u2019t think of it as being feminist. It\u2019s not a label I have to put on myself. I\u2019m just all for gals,\u201d she says. It\u2019s not exactly a surprise that a 73-year-old woman from Tennessee would shy away from the f-word, but it does make me wonder why she agreed to be in such an overtly feminist movie to begin with. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t think about it in those terms, to be honest with you. I was thinking more in terms of business than subject matter. Jane was a big star and so was Lily, so I thought: \u2018This is great. If it\u2019s a big movie, I can share the glory, and if it\u2019s a flop it will be on them,\u2019 and Jane said: \u2018Well, Dolly will give us [audiences in] the south,\u2019\u201d she says. Parton\u2019s 9 to 5 co-stars have always been more than happy to shout about feminism, and they very nearly caused her to topple off her careful tightrope when the three of them appeared together at the 2017 Emmy awards. \u201cBack in 1980, when we made that movie, we refused to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying hypocritical bigot \u2026\u201d Fonda began. \u201c\u2026 And it\u2019s true in 2017 we still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot,\u201d Tomlin finished. Parton\u2019s eyes widened in what looked very much like alarm at this obvious shot at Donald Trump, and she quickly changed the subject with a joke about her breasts and \u201ca shoutout to Dabney Coleman out there\u201d. I tell her she didn\u2019t look very happy up on stage that night, and she jumps in before I even finish. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t like being part of \u2026 I don\u2019t like to be known by the company I keep, so to speak. I want to be my own individual self. If I\u2019ve got something to say, I\u2019ll say it, but I don\u2019t want to be dragged into it,\u201d she says. So she was surprised by what they said? \u201cIt was a little \u2026\u201d she begins, then stops herself. \u201cWell, it was not a surprise, knowing Lily and Jane. I just did not want everybody to think that whatever they think is what I think. I don\u2019t really like getting up on TV and saying political things. I don\u2019t even want to make a deal out of it, but I want people to know I\u2019m my own individual self. Even though [Fonda, Tomlin and I] may agree on a whole lot of things \u2013 and they may have more agreement [between] themselves because they\u2019ve been together for longer \u2013 I still have my own thoughts and my own way of doing things. It\u2019s not a matter of being disrespectful, it\u2019s just, OK, that\u2019s what they said, I\u2019m not getting involved in it,\u201d she says. Is that a personal preference or for the sake of her career? \u201cIt\u2019s for both. I\u2019ve got as many Republican friends as I\u2019ve got Democrat friends and I just don\u2019t like voicing my opinion on things. I\u2019ve seen things before, like the Dixie Chicks. You can ruin a career for speaking out,\u201d she says, referring to the backlash that group suffered after they spoke out in 2003 against the Iraq invasion. \u201cI respect my audience too much for that, I respect myself too much for that. Of course I have my own opinions, but that don\u2019t mean I got to throw them out there because you\u2019re going to piss off half the people.\u201d And even when she doesn\u2019t say anything she can still piss people off. After the Emmys, Parton\u2019s Facebook page was filled with messages from her fans, furious that she had been (an admittedly silent) part of Fonda and Tomlin\u2019s anti-Trump protest. Reactions were similarly virulent the year before when Parton seemed to endorse Hillary Clinton, with the supremely cautious quote: \u201cI personally think a woman would do a great job [as president]. I think Hillary\u2019s very qualified. So, if she gets it, I\u2019ll certainly be behind her.\u201d Parton later had to issue a statement saying she endorsed neither Trump nor Clinton, and chucked in an inevitable breast joke to lighten the mood. (\u201cI might as well run myself because they could always use more boobs in the race.\u201d) So who can blame her for preferring to avoid controversy? I tell her that I remember seeing her on Oprah in the 90s, during the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal, when Parton said she couldn\u2019t disapprove of the president because he reminded her of her brothers. \u201cYeah! I know those men. In every man I see someone in my family,\u201d she says brightly. So does she see her brothers in Trump? \u201cI ain\u2019t talking about Trump!\u201d she shoots back sharply. Some subjects are too controversial for even Parton to neutralise. Parton was born and raised in a one-room cabin in the Great Smoky mountains in East Tennessee. Her extraordinary rise from the depths of deep-south poverty to the pinnacle of celebrity is so well known it is close to being a myth, thanks in no small part to Parton\u2019s own songs about her life, such as Tennessee Homesick Blues and Coat of Many Colors. She is enormously skilled at appearing to share details about her personal life without actually divulging very much. She makes frequent reference to her husband, Carl Dean, but no one has seen her with him for decades. Her physical appearance has always seemed to me like a metaphor for her actual person: she gives a lot of good \u2013 and distracting \u2013 front, but the reality is definitely obscured. \u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s some big mystery, I just know you can\u2019t just \u2026 I\u2019m just private, put it that way,\u201d she says. \u201cEven though I\u2019m public, there\u2019s still a very private side. But that\u2019s what keeps me sane, and I guess it\u2019s what keeps people intrigued \u2013 they think they\u2019re going to find out something more. But you\u2019re only going to know as much as I\u2019m going to tell you.\u201d One of the things many people have tried to find out is if Parton is gay. The rumours stem from her closeness to her childhood friend, Judy Ogle, who often accompanies her on tours instead of her husband. Parton\u2019s uncharacteristically political stance on gay rights, such as speaking out in defence of gay marriage, have also fuelled rumours, all of which Parton has always laughingly denied. Last time we spoke, she said simply, when I asked about Ogle: \u201cVery few people know what it\u2019s like to have a very best friend and keep that best friend all your life.\u201d Tomlin came out in 2013 at the age of 74, having waited until her mother died to confirm the long-swirling rumours. Did Parton know Tomlin was gay when they made 9 to 5? \u201cLily? Of course! All of us knew Lily was gay for years, I didn\u2019t know she wasn\u2019t actually out. But I know that her mother was a southern woman and a lot of people don\u2019t accept it, and a lot of people have suffered their whole lives because they can\u2019t be who they are, and I understand that, too.\u201d Parton doesn\u2019t blink when I follow this by asking if Ogle is with her on this trip. \u201cOgle is usually with me, but she broke her hip, so she\u2019s not on this trip. But yes, usually she travels with me. So for now I\u2019m on my own,\u201d she says. Parton became famous in an era when it was taken for granted that celebrities would conceal, as opposed to today when they are expected to reveal all. Never would Parton post a photo of herself on social media without full makeup, as Fonda did last year. (\u201cI thought it was cute, but no, never!\u201d) Parton\u2019s work ethic is extraordinary, but the real proof of her stamina is her public persona, which she maintains as indefatigably as her makeup. The night before we meet, a friend at the BBC texted me to say she happened to meet Parton in a corridor, and she got \u201cthe full Dolly Parton experience\u201d: southern aphorisms, boob jokes, sunny friendliness. Does she never get tired of having to be \u201cDolly Parton\u201d for everybody? \u201cNo, I enjoy what I do,\u201d she says firmly. \u201cI enjoy being loved \u2013 I love that. I always ask God to let me shine a light and uplift mankind because that is my purpose. I look fake, but my world is real to me.\u201d 9 to 5 the Musical is now on at the Savoy theatre, London",

      "body": "<p>A media rule of thumb: beware those moments when competing editors, leader writers and commentators agree with each other and politicians leap on the bandwagon. It always heralds a moral panic.</p> <p>This has been perfectly illustrated by the case of Shamima Begum, the 19-year-old Islamic State recruit who gave birth to her third child \u2013 the previous two having died \u2013 in a Syrian refugee camp. She would have been an easy target at any time. Now, with Britain\u2019s parliament in disarray and the country hopelessly split over Brexit, here was a rallying point for collective outrage. Nobody, surely, could disagree.</p> <p>As the Daily Telegraph\u2019s columnist, Allison Pearson, confidently put it, the belief that \u201cthis fanatically stupid young woman \u2026 must not under any circumstances be allowed to return to Britain, is pretty much the only thing right now that unites this divided kingdom\u201d.</p> <p>The Sun, no surprise, agreed, with a typically trenchant front page headline: \u201cNo regrets. No remorse. No entry\u201d. Convinced that its readers were of one mind, it said the \u201cJihadi bride \u2026 must never set foot in Britain again\u201d because she \u201cwould eradicate our way of life if she could\u201d. Its call was explicit: \u201cStrip her of her citizenship.\u201d</p> <p>Enter stage right, far right, Sajid Javid, a home secretary with prime ministerial ambitions who knows how to exploit a wave of press-fuelled righteous indignation when he sees one. Result? Trusting that he had overwhelming public support, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/21/what-is-the-truth-about-shamima-begums-citizenship-status\">removed Begum\u2019s British citizenship</a>.</p> <p>It would appear that the Sun, the paper with its inky finger on the pulse of a mere 4.2 million readers out of 66 million population, can still call the political tune.</p> <p>Javid would have been better advised to read the much more sensible editorials in newspapers that, despite their conservative leanings, refused to take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/aug/20/mondaymediasection.immigrationasylumandrefugees\">a knee-jerk line</a>; and, in so doing, urged him to obey the Home Office\u2019s own guidelines on what should be done about returning Isis fighters and their sympathisers.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the Times. Begum \u201cshould be allowed to return to her family in Britain and explain her actions \u2026 A judgment will have to be made as to whether she is more victim than perpetrator.\u201d</p> <p>Even the new Daily Mail (doubtless to the fury of its former editor) said it accepted \u201cshe was a vulnerable child when groomed at her computer by evil recruiters\u201d and thereafter \u201cindoctrinated by jihadists in Syria\u201d. She was, it said, British, and to deny her access \u201cwould breach international law\u201d.</p> <p>Those initial newspaper reactions were tempered somewhat by Begum\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/17/shamima-begum-who-fled-uk-to-join-isis-has-given-birth-say-family\">misguided comments in her first BBC interview</a>. Did she not realise how inappropriate it was to defend the murderous attack on the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester as \u201cretaliation\u201d for the military action in Syria?</p> <p>Yet it was the clumsiness of her statements that illustrated a point made by the security minister, Ben Wallace, when he once described \u201cminors brought up in the war zone as bordering between \u2018victim and brainwashed\u2019 \u201d. After fleeing her London home at 15 and spending four years with barbaric fanatics, did she know of what she spoke?</p> <p>But Javid could take heart from his press cheerleaders. The Daily Express greeted his decision to remove her citizenship with the headline \u201cSense at last!\u201d And the Sun was nothing short of ecstatic about \u201cthis remorseless teenager\u201d being banned from Britain, praising Javid\u2019s \u201cswift and bold action\u201d and concluding: \u201cWell done, The Saj\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dc59880897ae6d236c6d0f399d505972065cef8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dc59880897ae6d236c6d0f399d505972065cef8/0_58_2505_1503/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sajid Javid\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sajid Javid. The Daily Telegraph gave him unswerving support, partly on the grounds that Jeremy Corbyn had taken the opposite view.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Saj may have bathed in momentary glory. He had solved a problem by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/20/rights-of-shamima-begums-son-not-affected-says-javid\">passing the buck to Bangladesh</a>. Again, as a prelude to what was to become a backlash against his high-handed move, he might have done well to turn to the new Mail, which wondered whether \u201cwe\u201d were \u201cbeing too hasty?\u201d In a sensible leading article, it argued that \u201cfor all her transgressions\u201d Begum \u201cwas made in England\u201d and should be allowed to return \u201cto face British justice\u201d. After all, Britain\u2019s constitution has been\u201cbuilt on the rule of law\u201d.</p> <p>The Times and the Guardian put the same point more forcefully. To remove Begum\u2019s passport, said the Times, was \u201can unworthy populist gesture\u201d. The Guardian called it \u201cshocking and shameful\u201d, contending that it \u201cdoes a disservice to this country\u201d. Here was a woman \u201cborn in Britain, raised in Britain and radicalised in Britain \u2026 now being treated as someone else\u2019s problem\u201d.</p> <p>For an all-too-brief moment, it appeared that the Daily Telegraph had woken up to the consequences of Javid\u2019s illiberal decision by publishing a piece by Nick Timothy in which he argued that dumping unwanted nationals on blameless countries was a grave error.</p> <p>Many lawyers were, by now, making clear their doubts about Begum\u2019s banishment.</p> <p>The Telegraph also carried a reader\u2019s letter that ran counter to its militant line. \u201cBegum was a child when she made a mistake,\u201d it said. \u201cShe is a victim; her unborn child is a victim. She should be allowed back into this country to pursue as normal a life as is possible, and to bring up her child. Mercy is a sign of strength.\u201d</p> <p>But the paper, which is now indistinguishable from the Sun only by its shape and the colour of its masthead, was back to form the following day. It gave unswerving support to Javid, partly on the grounds that Jeremy Corbyn had taken the opposite point of view.</p> <p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/feb/21/brexit-hammond-warns-of-no-deal-damage-as-more-tories-consider-exit-politics-live\">Corbyn\u2019s intervention on behalf of Begum</a> was meat and drink to his press opponents and their reaction was predictable. \u201cWhat else\u201d, said the Sun, \u201cwould we expect from the terrorists\u2019 friend?\u201d</p> <p>As far as the Express was concerned, Javid had spoken \u201cfor the majority of Britons when he cut Begum adrift\u201d while the Labour leader\u2019s \u201cjudgment is frighteningly perverse\u201d.</p> <p>No wonder Begum told the Sunday Telegraph: \u201cI regret speaking to the media.\u201d For the real perversity of this episode is Javid\u2019s pandering to populism based on an apparent faith in the rightwing press\u2019s ability to represent majority opinion. These newspapers, always players to the gallery, portray only a narrow set of values and interests.

      "bodyText": "A media rule of thumb: beware those moments when competing editors, leader writers and commentators agree with each other and politicians leap on the bandwagon. It always heralds a moral panic. This has been perfectly illustrated by the case of Shamima Begum, the 19-year-old Islamic State recruit who gave birth to her third child \u2013 the previous two having died \u2013 in a Syrian refugee camp. She would have been an easy target at any time. Now, with Britain\u2019s parliament in disarray and the country hopelessly split over Brexit, here was a rallying point for collective outrage. Nobody, surely, could disagree. As the Daily Telegraph\u2019s columnist, Allison Pearson, confidently put it, the belief that \u201cthis fanatically stupid young woman \u2026 must not under any circumstances be allowed to return to Britain, is pretty much the only thing right now that unites this divided kingdom\u201d. The Sun, no surprise, agreed, with a typically trenchant front page headline: \u201cNo regrets. No remorse. No entry\u201d. Convinced that its readers were of one mind, it said the \u201cJihadi bride \u2026 must never set foot in Britain again\u201d because she \u201cwould eradicate our way of life if she could\u201d. Its call was explicit: \u201cStrip her of her citizenship.\u201d Enter stage right, far right, Sajid Javid, a home secretary with prime ministerial ambitions who knows how to exploit a wave of press-fuelled righteous indignation when he sees one. Result? Trusting that he had overwhelming public support, he removed Begum\u2019s British citizenship. It would appear that the Sun, the paper with its inky finger on the pulse of a mere 4.2 million readers out of 66 million population, can still call the political tune. Javid would have been better advised to read the much more sensible editorials in newspapers that, despite their conservative leanings, refused to take a knee-jerk line; and, in so doing, urged him to obey the Home Office\u2019s own guidelines on what should be done about returning Isis fighters and their sympathisers. Here\u2019s the Times. Begum \u201cshould be allowed to return to her family in Britain and explain her actions \u2026 A judgment will have to be made as to whether she is more victim than perpetrator.\u201d Even the new Daily Mail (doubtless to the fury of its former editor) said it accepted \u201cshe was a vulnerable child when groomed at her computer by evil recruiters\u201d and thereafter \u201cindoctrinated by jihadists in Syria\u201d. She was, it said, British, and to deny her access \u201cwould breach international law\u201d. Those initial newspaper reactions were tempered somewhat by Begum\u2019s misguided comments in her first BBC interview. Did she not realise how inappropriate it was to defend the murderous attack on the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester as \u201cretaliation\u201d for the military action in Syria? Yet it was the clumsiness of her statements that illustrated a point made by the security minister, Ben Wallace, when he once described \u201cminors brought up in the war zone as bordering between \u2018victim and brainwashed\u2019 \u201d. After fleeing her London home at 15 and spending four years with barbaric fanatics, did she know of what she spoke? But Javid could take heart from his press cheerleaders. The Daily Express greeted his decision to remove her citizenship with the headline \u201cSense at last!\u201d And the Sun was nothing short of ecstatic about \u201cthis remorseless teenager\u201d being banned from Britain, praising Javid\u2019s \u201cswift and bold action\u201d and concluding: \u201cWell done, The Saj\u201d. The Saj may have bathed in momentary glory. He had solved a problem by passing the buck to Bangladesh. Again, as a prelude to what was to become a backlash against his high-handed move, he might have done well to turn to the new Mail, which wondered whether \u201cwe\u201d were \u201cbeing too hasty?\u201d In a sensible leading article, it argued that \u201cfor all her transgressions\u201d Begum \u201cwas made in England\u201d and should be allowed to return \u201cto face British justice\u201d. After all, Britain\u2019s constitution has been\u201cbuilt on the rule of law\u201d. The Times and the Guardian put the same point more forcefully. To remove Begum\u2019s passport, said the Times, was \u201can unworthy populist gesture\u201d. The Guardian called it \u201cshocking and shameful\u201d, contending that it \u201cdoes a disservice to this country\u201d. Here was a woman \u201cborn in Britain, raised in Britain and radicalised in Britain \u2026 now being treated as someone else\u2019s problem\u201d. For an all-too-brief moment, it appeared that the Daily Telegraph had woken up to the consequences of Javid\u2019s illiberal decision by publishing a piece by Nick Timothy in which he argued that dumping unwanted nationals on blameless countries was a grave error. Many lawyers were, by now, making clear their doubts about Begum\u2019s banishment. The Telegraph also carried a reader\u2019s letter that ran counter to its militant line. \u201cBegum was a child when she made a mistake,\u201d it said. \u201cShe is a victim; her unborn child is a victim. She should be allowed back into this country to pursue as normal a life as is possible, and to bring up her child. Mercy is a sign of strength.\u201d But the paper, which is now indistinguishable from the Sun only by its shape and the colour of its masthead, was back to form the following day. It gave unswerving support to Javid, partly on the grounds that Jeremy Corbyn had taken the opposite point of view. Indeed, Corbyn\u2019s intervention on behalf of Begum was meat and drink to his press opponents and their reaction was predictable. \u201cWhat else\u201d, said the Sun, \u201cwould we expect from the terrorists\u2019 friend?\u201d As far as the Express was concerned, Javid had spoken \u201cfor the majority of Britons when he cut Begum adrift\u201d while the Labour leader\u2019s \u201cjudgment is frighteningly perverse\u201d. No wonder Begum told the Sunday Telegraph: \u201cI regret speaking to the media.\u201d For the real perversity of this episode is Javid\u2019s pandering to populism based on an apparent faith in the rightwing press\u2019s ability to represent majority opinion. These newspapers, always players to the gallery, portray only a narrow set of values and interests. They are, by their nature, reactionary. Then again, how refreshing is the new Mail, proof that conservative does not need to mean hide-bound, intolerant and prejudiced by appealing only to the lowest common denominator.",

Dan Biggar was the replacement who turned into a game finisher and it raised a question about Eddie Jones\u2019s scrum-half policy. He has preferred to have two in a squad rather than three to maximise their time on the training field, but having dropped Danny Care, the finisher supreme, after three years, and replaced him with the internationally inexperienced Dan Robson, England\u2019s head coach has become reliant on a starter.</p> \n<p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/feb/24/warren-gatland-wales-six-nations-win-england-grand-slam\" title=\"\">Robert Kitson: Wales\u2019s comeback is one of Gatland\u2019s finest hours</a></p> \n<h2><strong>2) Hook, line and Sinckler</strong></h2> \n<p>Wales said before the match that while they felt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/21/warren-gatland-wales-england-six-nations-kyle-sinckler-emotional-timebomb\" title=\"\">Kyle Sinckler struggled to contain his emotions</a> in the heat of the battle, they had no intention of lighting his fuse. Not until the first scrum when there were more views exchanged than in a Question Time Brexit debate. Wales kept pushing but as long as England were in control, which they largely were in the first half, the prop responded through his tackling, carrying and scrummaging. As Wales took the initiative after the break so his stitching started to unravel and was replaced after conceding two penalties. He will know better next time in Cardiff and remains a significant asset.</p> \n<p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/23/wales-england-player-ratings\" title=\"\">Wales 21-13 England: Six Nations player ratings from Cardiff</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"802de1c82c3c54e8b7a7f1ef95a2cbc0db5a71aa\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/802de1c82c3c54e8b7a7f1ef95a2cbc0db5a71aa/0_68_4392_2636/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kyle Sinckler walks off the pitch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kyle Sinckler walks off the pitch.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>3) If they think it\u2019s all over \u2026</h2> \n<p>Eddie Jones said that Wales are the ones smiling for now.

      "bodyText": "1) England\u2019s scrum-half options look unbalanced Two years ago England used their bench in the final quarter to come from behind to defeat France and Wales, but the half-backs Dan Robson and George Ford never left it on Saturday. Dan Biggar was the replacement who turned into a game finisher and it raised a question about Eddie Jones\u2019s scrum-half policy. He has preferred to have two in a squad rather than three to maximise their time on the training field, but having dropped Danny Care, the finisher supreme, after three years, and replaced him with the internationally inexperienced Dan Robson, England\u2019s head coach has become reliant on a starter. \u2022 Robert Kitson: Wales\u2019s comeback is one of Gatland\u2019s finest hours 2) Hook, line and Sinckler Wales said before the match that while they felt Kyle Sinckler struggled to contain his emotions in the heat of the battle, they had no intention of lighting his fuse. Not until the first scrum when there were more views exchanged than in a Question Time Brexit debate. Wales kept pushing but as long as England were in control, which they largely were in the first half, the prop responded through his tackling, carrying and scrummaging. As Wales took the initiative after the break so his stitching started to unravel and was replaced after conceding two penalties. He will know better next time in Cardiff and remains a significant asset. \u2022 Wales 21-13 England: Six Nations player ratings from Cardiff 3) If they think it\u2019s all over \u2026 Eddie Jones said that Wales are the ones smiling for now. The grand slam has gone but the championship remains open with England having the smoother run-in, Italy and Scotland at home, while Wales have to go to Murrayfield before welcoming the champions, Ireland. It is the fourth time Wales have won their opening three games and on the other occasions they have secured the grand slam. Lacking try bonus points, it looks their route to the top again in Warren Gatland\u2019s 12th and final year. \u2022 Wales 21-13 England: match report 4. Catching up Wales were confident of winning. Like England, they had won their opening two games, but the plaudits had all gone to the men in white. Wales forensically examined the tactics of a side that not long ago were on a losing run and concluded that if their power and kicking was dealt with, their narrow defence could be exploited as time wore on.

Wales turned England\u2019s tactics back on them, powering their way to their first try and taking to the air for the second. \u2022 Jones will not rule out title as Gatland chases grand slam 5. The biter bit A turning point was the final minute of the first half when England turned an attacking lineout into a driving maul. Wales held firm and then defended the cross-kick to the right corner. England had seized those moments against Ireland and France and had they scored on Saturday, they would have been 15-3 up with a conversion to come, meaning Wales would have to do more than chip away at their lead after the break.

In a forthright interview on The Andrew Marr Show, Watson urged Corbyn to take personal leadership of efforts to tackle antisemitism in his party and to reach out to MPs from the social democratic tradition. \u201cMy message to our Labour party, to our half million members, is \u2013 \u2018look, I know we\u2019re in a crisis. The departure of our colleagues is a real blow to us, and we need to understand why they felt they need to go, because if we\u2019re going to be in government, we need to address those concerns\u2019,\u201d he said. Watson\u2019s intervention was the latest blow in an escalating war of words between Corbyn and his deputy, who is directly elected by party members. Watson said he had received 50 complaints about antisemitism from colleagues in the past week, which he had forwarded to Corbyn. \u201cJeremy needs to understand that if we are going to be in No 10, he needs to change the Labour party,\u201d he said. He needs to take a personal lead in reviewing those cases, and recommending to the national executive committee what needs to be done.\u201d Details of the dossier, seen by the Guardian, include Labour members sending tweets linking Hitler and the Rothschilds, accusing Jews of murdering children and questioning whether Jewish MPs and councillors have \u201chuman blood\u201d. All of the cases have been raised by Watson or other Labour MPs over a period of several months, but no action has been reported back to those who have raised the complaints, he said. One case involved a tweet, which read: \u201cWonder why Jewish people are hated wherever they\u2019ve settled over last 2000 years. Their double dealing, back stabbing, cheating chilling coldness has always only one outcome. I wonder what the average period of time is before people fed up with the anti-social Jews kick em out\u201d. Another concerned a tweet saying that \u201cJews murder people and children\u201d. A third complaint involved comments about Jewish MPs and councillors that said: \u201cDon\u2019t know what runs through their veins, not human blood\u201d and \u201ctheir hearts and brains totally devoid of humanity\u201d. One of those attacked was Liverpool Riverside MP Louise Ellman, who is deemed at risk of following Luciana Berger\u2019s example and quitting the party. A fourth complaint related to social media posts, including one that said: \u201cHitler is an illegitimate Rothschild, so any offspring of him who would have a good chance of being propelled into a position of power.\u201d Watson said Corbyn should review the details of all 50 cases personally, and \u201cgo to the NEC, where he is in control. They will back him if he says \u2018these people need to be thrown out\u2019\u201d. Labour sources were quick to play down the idea that Corbyn could take a direct role in examining specific cases, however, stressing that the leadership did not oversee the party\u2019s disciplinary process. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe Labour party takes all complaints of antisemitism extremely seriously and we are committed to challenging and campaigning against it in all its forms. All complaints about antisemitism are investigated in line with our rules and procedures and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken.\u201d Many MPs have felt frustrated that while Labour\u2019s general secretary, Jennie Formby, has repeatedly promised to step up efforts to tackle antisemitism, specific cases raised have resulted in little or no action. \u201cVery patently, the Jennie Formby reforms have not been adequate. They have not succeeded,\u201d Watson said. He also reiterated his demand for Corbyn to reshuffle the shadow cabinet to give greater weight to MPs with social democratic rather than socialist views. If that did not happen in the days ahead, he said he would \u201cconvene a group of MPs, who believe in that tradition, to develop policies\u201d. The as-yet-unnamed group, which is expected to meet in the next fortnight, will commission research and draft papers to submit to the shadow cabinet and Labour\u2019s policy forums. Watson said Labour had always been an amalgam of different traditions. \u201cWe\u2019re only electorally successful if those traditions can rub up against each other,\u201d he said. \u201cHarold Wilson had Tony Benn and Roy Jenkins in his cabinet, and so that is our challenge.\u201d He also lent his support to efforts by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, to persuade the leadership to swing its weight behind a second referendum. \u201cWhat we would prefer is that Theresa May aligns around our red lines, which is closeness to the EU, but if we can\u2019t get our red lines met, then conference policy, negotiated by Keir Starmer, is that we go for a people\u2019s vote,\u201d he said. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said on Sunday that Labour was moving toward supporting a referendum, and that the party could back a redrafted version of an amendment suggested by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson under which the prime minister would put her deal to a public vote. \u201cThere\u2019s increasingly large numbers of people who will consider now moving towards a public vote situation to block a no deal, and to block a bad deal,\u201d he said. Watson hit back against Corbyn\u2019s insistence on Friday that there was no place for bullying in the Labour party, repeating his claim that Berger, the Liverpool Wavertree MP who was sitting across from him in the BBC studio, had been \u201cbullied out of the Labour party by a small number of racist thugs\u201d. Asked about these claims by Sky News on Friday, Corbyn said there was \u201cno place for harshness, bullying or anything else in the party. And to tell you the truth, I don\u2019t believe it exists on a wide scale\u201d. After seven Labour MPs resigned on Monday, to be followed by another two by the end of the week, Watson urged the Labour leader to \u201cbroaden out\u201d the frontbench, to reflect the range of views in the wider parliamentary party. When Corbyn was asked directly about that demand last week, he shrugged it off. \u201cAnyone who does not feel consulted is not taking up, in my view, the opportunities that are available, at all times, to do that,\u201d he said. The Labour leader and his close allies have also taken a robust stance against the defectors, urging them to call byelections in their seats. The party chair, Ian Lavery, has called them an \u201cestablishment tribute act\u201d and the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, told a rally on Saturday they had betrayed their party and that she would rather die than leave Labour. Watson called on colleagues to \u201cdial down the rhetoric\u201d. \u201cI was born into the Labour party, but I think dying is a virtue that\u2019s overrated,\u201d he said. Asked whether he could join the defectors, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve been in the LP since I was 15 years old. You\u2019d have to drive me out.\u201d \u2022This article was amended on 24 February to remove a quote wrongly attributed to Jeremy Corbyn.",

      "bodyText": "The United Kingdom is a critically important actor in the global fight against climate change. As a permanent member of the UN security council, and a member of the G20 group of leading industrialised economies, it is well placed to further a progressive climate agenda and influence other states to fully implement commitments made under the Paris agreement. Decarbonisation is a vital part of this agenda. The UK has made important progress in this regard; in April 2017, it enjoyed its first full day without any coal-fired electricity since the 1880s, which was a striking achievement for a country that had been at the vanguard of the Industrial Revolution. As the prime minister, Theresa May, said last year: \u201cWe can be proud of our success in facing up to the reality of climate change, but we are not complacent about the action needed to sustain that success in the future.\u201d The best way for any country to avoid climate complacency is to develop robust, holistic and people-centred policies across government, so short-term trade or financial priorities do not trump the wider imperative of cutting global emissions. The UK now faces a crucial opportunity to live up to the prime minister\u2019s words and prove it is serious about phasing out the use of fossil fuels worldwide, and not only on its own territory. The UK parliament\u2019s environmental audit committee is currently holding an inquiry into UK Export Finance\u2019s (UKEF) financing of fossil fuels in developing countries. This government agency provides financial support for international trade with the aim of boosting British companies\u2019 exports. It is deeply concerning to note that over the period 2010-2014, UKEF provided more than 99.4% of its energy finance to fossil fuels, and less than 1% to renewable energy. Over the longer timeframe of 2010-16, it is estimated that UKEF provided \u00a34.8bn of support for fossil fuel projects. The UK\u2019s total spend on its International Climate Fund for a similar period, 2011-17, was \u00a34.9bn. These figures and policies are hard to reconcile with the UK\u2019s commitments under the Paris agreement, its membership of the Powering Past Coal Alliance and its own pledge in 2013 to end support for public financing of new coal-fired power plants overseas. They are also at odds with the view of the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who warned in 2014 of the stranded asset risk inherent in fossil fuel projects. The time has come for the UK to change course, in the interests of the whole world. Research indicates that a third of oil reserves, half of gas reserves and over 80% of current coal reserves need to remain in the ground in order to meet the target of 2C of global warming. But as the recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change set out so starkly, our target must be 1.5C if we want to avert irreparable damage to our planetary ecosystem \u2013 so even more radical action against fossil fuels is required. Meeting these challenges can only be done collectively, in a spirit of international and intergenerational solidarity under the framework of the United Nations. I was UN secretary general when the Paris agreement was signed, and the sustainable development goals agreed. I valued the UK\u2019s contributions and commitment to both these vital multilateral achievements, and continue to believe the country can play a transformative role in shaping the global climate agenda. As deputy chair of the Elders I continue to call on G20 nations to move away from fossil fuel investment, and I believe the UK can play a leading role in this crucial move. I encourage the UK government to recalibrate its export finance policy so it is fully consistent with international climate trends and obligations. Promoting fossil fuel investments abroad locks in high-carbon infrastructure in developing countries for years to come, which is the opposite of sustainable development. There is now a growing consensus that fossil fuels should not be funded in any way by export finance organisations. The World Bank Group has already ended its finance to upstream oil and gas; the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development recently ended finance to coal; and the Swedish Export Credit Corporation has announced it is going fully fossil-free. UKEF and the wider UK government should use the occasion of the parliamentary inquiry to demonstrate a clear shift in policy away from fossil fuels and use its investments to support clean energy. If the UK takes these necessary steps, it can be at the forefront of the transition to a low-carbon economy. I look forward to seeing its government, industries and people rising to this challenge.",

He is cerebral palsy\u2019s James Bond: he has licence, if not to kill, then to wound by being awful to all-comers. He is to political correctness what Boris Johnson is to statesmanship. He is a sociopathic American who parlays his palsy into guilt-tripping PC Britons \u2013 which, as you know, is as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.</p> <p>There\u2019s another reason I like Renkow. His on-screen mother is Lorraine Bracco, who has moved from one toxic relationship as Tony Soprano\u2019s shrink to another as mother to the most unpleasant American living in Britain (a hotly contested title). We see Bracco only on Renkow\u2019s laptop, exhorting her son to get on with his life in the hoarsely captivating voice that still reduces me to jelly even when she is speaking such unsexy words as: \u201cI can tell you as the world\u2019s leading authority on cerebral palsy, that being a pussy is not a symptom.\u201d And yet, despite this sensible advice, Tim remains a pussy and a jerk: he is never going to get a worthwhile job, a date or a visa with those twin attributes.</p> <p>Part of the pleasure of the opening episode is watching Renkow do everything he can to get fired, knowing that his bosses will do all they can to keep him on the payroll. \u201cI think I\u2019m on some sort of quota scheme, so they don\u2019t have to hire a transsexual,\u201d he muses sourly.</p> <p>In this, Renkow is akin to George Costanza in the Seinfeld episode in which he feigned disability to get preferential treatment (including the keys to the executive washroom), knowingly exploiting bosses\u2019 awkwardness about disability. But, while Costanza was a phoney asshole working a guilt-ridden system to his advantage, Renkow is no phoney, but all asshole. When Sean asks Tim if he has any special needs, he demands a chair made of salmon leather, new shoes and a bigger desk. Bigger than hers, he says, pointing at Anne who sits opposite.</p> <p>Of course, it is wrong of him to mutate into Nigel Farage with nice but invertebrate Anne. When she breastfeeds her baby in the office, he sarcastically complains: \u201cI didn\u2019t think you could eat lunch at your desk.\u201d Less wrong of him to suggest a new line for her greeting card. \u201cHello baby! Bye-bye wallet,\u201d she suggests. \u201cBye-bye perineum,\u201d he counters.</p> <p>How can disability be funny? Jerk suggests one way, not by making us laughing at disability (that, as you know, is wrong), but by exploiting the comic potential of a situation in which a jerk uses their disability to yank someone\u2019s chain. Renkow gets his kicks from making others feel bad about his disability. Typical is the opening gag in which a man comes out of a cafe\u2019s disabled toilet to be confronted by Renkow, who has thrown a glass of water over his crotch and gives his adversary a how-could-you? stare.</p> <p>The first episode is mostly a delight, although Renkow could have made more of the scene in which he struggles to get his walking frame into the office through the only entrance, a set of rotating doors. Also delightful are the two sidekicks Renkow and his co-writers Shaun Pye and Stu Richards have created. Idris is a geek who tries and largely fails to be Tim\u2019s employment consultant (there is literally nobody on British TV less like Idris Elba than him), and my other new hero is Ruth, Tom\u2019s epically careless care-worker.

He foments staff dissent by opening payslips and blabbing about who gets paid what. He sets off the fire alarm, causing mass panic. Best of all, when he goes to an ideas meeting, he is asked to suggest how working practices could be improved. How about, he offers, all of you get some self-respect? To be fair, those to whom Tim is appalling deserve it. He has been hired by a greeting card manufacturer called Anarchy Hamster. The boss, Sean, who intolerably styles himself \u201cchief lunatic\u201d, has created a work environment of teeth-clenching, compulsory fun. Anarchy Hamster is a company devoted to flooding the world with fatuousness. So, when Tim discloses he may or may not defecate in his boss\u2019s desk drawer, we may well think Sean has it coming.

However, while it takes the company in a different direction, it dwells, still, on death and loss.</p> <p>Creator Alan Lucien \u00d8yen is a Norwegian choreographer and playwright who uses text, dance and music to cinematic effect in a piece that\u2019s meticulously crafted and confidently realised. There\u2019s much talking, but it\u2019s not a play \u2013 rather, a collection of shifting memories, expanded, refracted, and perhaps embroidered into a script that came out of long conversations with the cast in which the spectre of death hangs heavily.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"45c1c5cb56d0de7d673b268cc20cbf001796d7fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45c1c5cb56d0de7d673b268cc20cbf001796d7fe/0_187_5288_3338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cinematic \u2026 Bon Voyage, Bob \u2026\" width=\"1000\" height=\"631\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cinematic \u2026 Bon Voyage, Bob \u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Hobson/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a bit-part for love, but it\u2019s mainly loss. Of brothers and fathers, in murders and especially suicides, in scenes tragic, surreal, funny or matter-of-fact: a funeral director who is far too frank about his business; <a href=\"http://www.pina-bausch.de/en/person/show/julie-shanahan/\">Julie Shanahan</a> marvelling at the colossal size of a tear on a cinema screen compared with her own \u201ctiny, insignificant\u201d ones. The dancing offers texture and breathing space when there\u2019s nothing left to say, mostly in solos that make wonderful use of the performers, whether the light, molten whoosh of <a href=\"http://www.pina-bausch.de/en/person/show/jonathan-fredrickson/\">Jonathan Fredrickson</a>\u2019s long limbs or dancers <a href=\"http://www.pina-bausch.de/en/person/show/aida-vainieri/\">Aida Vainieri</a> and H\u00e9l\u00e9na Pikon, who have mastered the depth that lies in doing very little.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3328600fad3e01f094d75ee65d1c6702db6286b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3328600fad3e01f094d75ee65d1c6702db6286b/0_549_5565_3543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rainer Behr, Andrey Berezin and \u00c7a\u011fda\u015f Ermis in Bon Voyage, Bob \u2026\" width=\"1000\" height=\"637\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rainer Behr, Andrey Berezin and \u00c7a\u011fda\u015f Ermis in Bon Voyage, Bob \u2026 at Sadler\u2019s Wells.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What \u00d8yen has taken wholesale from Bausch is her attitude to running times. At three and a half hours, it\u2019s on the trying side, especially in a work without narrative propulsion that repeats and resets like an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_stairs\">Escher staircase</a>. Time has stopped on stage (the clock\u2019s hands frozen), just as time stops in grief \u2013 what the poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/jun/13/poem-of-the-week-death-makes-dead-metaphor-revive-by-denise-riley\">Denise Riley calls \u201ctime lived without its flow\u201d</a> \u2013 that stasis and limbo underlined by a succession of mournful musical refrains, each one sounding like the bittersweet coda of a film: ending after ending, death after death.</p> <p>Bon Voyage, Bob \u2026 has itself a very poignant ending. I won\u2019t describe it, but it feels as if for all that this piece takes Tanztheater Wuppertal on a fruitful new path, it has really <a href=\"http://www.pinabausch.org/en/pina/biography\">been about Pina all along</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://www.sadlerswells.com/whats-on/2019/tanztheater-wuppertal-pina-bausch-new-piece-2-alan-lucien-oyen/\">Sadler\u2019s Wells, London</a>, until 25 February.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bon Voyage, Bob \u2026 is only the second new full-length work by Tanztheater Wuppertal since founder Pina Bausch\u2019s death 10 years ago, and is a less obvious homage to Bausch than the first (Dimitris Papaioannou\u2019s Since She). However, while it takes the company in a different direction, it dwells, still, on death and loss. Creator Alan Lucien \u00d8yen is a Norwegian choreographer and playwright who uses text, dance and music to cinematic effect in a piece that\u2019s meticulously crafted and confidently realised. There\u2019s much talking, but it\u2019s not a play \u2013 rather, a collection of shifting memories, expanded, refracted, and perhaps embroidered into a script that came out of long conversations with the cast in which the spectre of death hangs heavily. There\u2019s a bit-part for love, but it\u2019s mainly loss. Of brothers and fathers, in murders and especially suicides, in scenes tragic, surreal, funny or matter-of-fact: a funeral director who is far too frank about his business; Julie Shanahan marvelling at the colossal size of a tear on a cinema screen compared with her own \u201ctiny, insignificant\u201d ones. The dancing offers texture and breathing space when there\u2019s nothing left to say, mostly in solos that make wonderful use of the performers, whether the light, molten whoosh of Jonathan Fredrickson\u2019s long limbs or dancers Aida Vainieri and H\u00e9l\u00e9na Pikon, who have mastered the depth that lies in doing very little. What \u00d8yen has taken wholesale from Bausch is her attitude to running times. At three and a half hours, it\u2019s on the trying side, especially in a work without narrative propulsion that repeats and resets like an Escher staircase. Time has stopped on stage (the clock\u2019s hands frozen), just as time stops in grief \u2013 what the poet Denise Riley calls \u201ctime lived without its flow\u201d \u2013 that stasis and limbo underlined by a succession of mournful musical refrains, each one sounding like the bittersweet coda of a film: ending after ending, death after death. Bon Voyage, Bob \u2026 has itself a very poignant ending. I won\u2019t describe it, but it feels as if for all that this piece takes Tanztheater Wuppertal on a fruitful new path, it has really been about Pina all along. \u2022 At Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, until 25 February.",

A gifted Oberlin Conservatory opera student who fell in love with traditional music in the early 2000s, she quickly became a brilliant banjo player, songwriter and folk singer. Awards rushed in: a Grammy in 2011 for her old-time band, Carolina Chocolate Drops, a BBC Radio 2 folk award for best singer in 2016 (the only time an American has won it) and, soon after, a MacArthur Foundation fellowship, a five-year national artistic endowment for her future career. Giddens has mastered other fields too, joining the cast of the US musical drama series <em>Nashville</em> for two seasons in 2017, and writing a ballet, <em><a href=\"https://www.nashvilleballet.com/lucy-negro-redux\" title=\"\">Lucy Negro</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.nashvilleballet.com/lucy-negro-redux\" title=\"\"> Redux</a></em>, about the Dark Lady of Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets, which had its world premiere earlier this month in Nashville.</p> <p>Giddens explains, warmly, how <em>The Songs of Our Native Daughters</em> project sprung from two sources: a poem she read with her young daughter at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, and a scene from the 2016 Nate Parker film, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/oct/10/the-birth-of-a-nation-problems-nate-parker\" title=\"\">Birth of </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/oct/10/the-birth-of-a-nation-problems-nate-parker\" title=\"\">a Nation</a>.</em> The poem was <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/abolitionist-poetry-book-for-children\" title=\"\">Pity for Poor Africans</a> from 1788, by English satirical poet and abolitionist William Cowper. \u201cAlthough I didn\u2019t know it was satirical at first,\u201d she says, half-laughing. Then she reads it: \u201c\u2018I own I am shock\u2019d at the purchase of slaves\u2026 but I must be mum, for how could we do without sugar or rum?\u2019 I texted Dirk [Powell, her regular co-producer] straight away. \u2018Oh my God! This has to be a song!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The poem\u2019s sentiment also made Giddens think about things people see as necessities in modern life, such as smartphones and TVs, which require people to work in terrible conditions to make them. \u201cI mean, people say things Cowper did in his poem today, without irony. People want to get on with ordinary life. And ignoring the way people are treated \u2013 that\u2019s how holocausts begin.\u201d This experience turned into a track on the album, Barbados, fitted around a haunting minor-key melody, the first to be notated by westerners from new world enslaved music.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The banjo was originally the 'banjer' or 'banza', and came from Africa to the Caribbean in the 17th to 18th centuries</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The scene in <em>Birth of </em><em>a Nation</em> that provoked Giddens showed a black woman being raped, then the camera ignoring her as her attacker left, but instead focusing on her husband as the wronged party. \u201cIt made me so mad. So many stories and perspectives just get pushed to one side.\u201d Her ire extends to how often musicians of colour in folk music are often ignored, too. She talks passionately about how the banjo was originally the \u201cbanjer\u201d or \u201cbanza\u201d, an instrument that came over from Africa to the Caribbean in the 17th to 18th centuries. It became claimed by white musicians as their own, and was played often in blackface minstrel shows in the mid 19th-century US. Giddens includes some minstrel banjo tunes on this record, pointedly reclaiming their roots.</p> <p>Giddens knew she wanted other female musicians to join her on this project, so she began, as she calls it, \u201ccasting the room\u201d. McCalla had been a fellow musician in the Carolina Chocolate Drops; she\u2019d known Russell for years on the traditional gig circuit. Kiah, a southern gothic blues player, was someone she\u2019d first seen singing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyRyO4qV7cc\" title=\"\">Trouble So Hard on YouTube</a>, the song best known for its remix by Moby, featuring the vocals of Alabama singer Vera Hall.</p> <p>One of Kiah\u2019s songs, Black Myself, starts the album brilliantly; it reflects how black girls start getting treated differently when they mature into women. \u201cWhen I was a girl growing up in a predominantly white, religiously conservative middle-class community, I was seen as harmless,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThen I was suddenly treated differently by people that I had played with for years.\u201d Her lyrics reflect experiences that have sadly travelled through time (\u201cYou look in my eyes, but you don\u2019t see me/ \u2019Cause I\u2019m black myself\u201d), but it ends with a hope for the future, as many of these songs do, albeit with a twist in the tail. \u201cI\u2019ve washed away my blood and tears/ I\u2019ve been born brand new/ There\u2019s no more workhorses/ But still some work to do.\u201d</p> <p>Recorded in Dirk Powell\u2019s studio on the banks of a bayou outside Breaux Bridge in Louisiana, the 12 days making the album were full-on, says Russell, on the phone from Nashville. \u201cBut there\u2019s this beautiful pressure that comes with needing to hit a deadline,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery day we could have talked for 24 hours, but we had to just get on with it. Get our stories out as they felt.\u201d</p> <p>On the first day, Giddens, Kiah and Russell wrote Moon Meets the Sun, proposing a delicious message of strength in the face of adversity (\u201cah you put the shackles on our feet/ But we\u2019re dancing\u201d). McCalla joined the gang a day later, heavily pregnant with twins. The experience focused Russell\u2019s mind on the connections between past and future generations of black women. \u201cWe kept thinking of our foremothers, and our kids, and seeing that line of strength and resilience in those songs,\u201d she says.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7PvWw97Cq0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M7PvWw97Cq0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7PvWw97Cq0\">The making of Mama\u2019s Cryin\u2019 Long \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In this setting, giving bigger stories to female characters mentioned in passing in folk songs also felt right. The song Polly Ann\u2019s Hammer takes the \u201clittle wife\u201d mentioned briefly in the folk ballad John Henry, who handles \u201csteel like a man\u201d while her husband is sick, and gives her her dues. He dies from the effects of his work, but she survives. \u201cThe supposedly weaker sex survives\u2026 raises the babies, and perhaps lives long enough to see their children campaign for civil rights and true freedom,\u201d Russell says.</p> <p>It is a song about one of Russell\u2019s Ghanaian ancestors that tells perhaps the album\u2019s most powerful story. Quasheba, Quasheba came to Russell late at night near the end of recording. She herself was fostered young, then endured years of abuse at the hands of a white adoptive father before meeting her biological father at 30, and delving into her family history. She then discovered Quasheba, sold into slavery from Africa, crossing the Atlantic in the hold of a ship, doing backbreaking work in the cane fields, suffering multiple rapes and sales, and having her children taken away.</p> <p>\u201cAnd she survived too,\u201d Russell says. \u201cTo find out I am here, that my child is here, because of this woman, and to know her name\u2026\u201d The album\u2019s goal burns in her words. \u201cI wanted to sing for her.\u201d And she does, pushing towards the future, the chorus of other Daughters fittingly rallying around her: \u201cHow far your spirit\u2019s flown/ Blood of your blood/ Bone of your bone/ By the grace of your strength\u2026 we are home.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://folkways.si.edu/songs-of-our-native-daughters\" title=\"\">Songs of Our Native Daughters is out now on Smithsonian Folkways Recordings</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4cd465cf6d08aaa2669ae6fb4568b796268f957c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cd465cf6d08aaa2669ae6fb4568b796268f957c/0_0_3000_1999/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rhiannon Giddens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rhiannon Giddens: \u2018So many stories and perspectives just get pushed to one side.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tanya Rosen-Jones</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

She herself was fostered young, then endured years of abuse at the hands of a white adoptive father before meeting her biological father at 30, and delving into her family history. She then discovered Quasheba, sold into slavery from Africa, crossing the Atlantic in the hold of a ship, doing backbreaking work in the cane fields, suffering multiple rapes and sales, and having her children taken away. \u201cAnd she survived too,\u201d Russell says. \u201cTo find out I am here, that my child is here, because of this woman, and to know her name\u2026\u201d The album\u2019s goal burns in her words. \u201cI wanted to sing for her.\u201d And she does, pushing towards the future, the chorus of other Daughters fittingly rallying around her: \u201cHow far your spirit\u2019s flown/ Blood of your blood/ Bone of your bone/ By the grace of your strength\u2026 we are home.\u201d Songs of Our Native Daughters is out now on Smithsonian Folkways Recordings",

He talks about families \u2026 well he is protecting his family. Why can\u2019t he enact zero-tolerance into church law? He has the power to do that.

A survivor from Chile told the bishops and religious superiors they had inflicted even more pain on victims by discrediting them and protecting the priests who abused. \u201cThe presidents of the bishops\u2019 conferences going home today will rest easy,\u201d added Doyle. \u201cThey will scrutinise the [pope\u2019s] talk and try to analyse the question: \u2018Do I have to do anything differently or risk losing my job?\u2019 The answer is no, there\u2019s nothing in this talk today that threatens the position and power of bishops. It is so far from what was needed.\u201d Father Hans Zollner, a member of the summit\u2019s organising committee, said during a press briefing on Sunday that the event was a \u201cquantitative and qualitative leap\u201d, adding that the church must \u201cown\u201d the problem and that it was in the process of \u201cturning things around\u201d. But dozens of survivors of clerical sexual abuse who travelled to Rome on the expectation of a stronger outcome felt severely let down. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for seven years \u2026 others have been waiting for much longer,\u201d said Alessandro Battaglia, 22. \u201cAfter four days, we get a piece of paper full of banality, and this is the church in which we\u2019re expected to believe. We are very disappointed.\u201d Francesco Zanardi, who set up Rete l\u2019Abuso, Italy\u2019s only network of clerical abuse survivors, said: \u201cWe\u2019re being taken for a ride. We expected a concrete response but nothing useful has come out of this. In this speech the church makes itself out to be the victim \u2013 but we are the victims.\u201d Peter Isley, spokesperson for Ending Clergy Abuse, an organisation that brings together activists from different countries, criticised the pope\u2019s speech for failing to signal that church leaders would get tough on removing from the ministry priests guilty of abuse and bishops who covered up for them. \u201cA child will be harmed today due to what the pope didn\u2019t say today,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat he\u2019s actually saying to all bishops is to \u2018keep on covering it up\u2019. He talks about families \u2026 well he is protecting his family. Why can\u2019t he enact zero-tolerance into church law? He has the power to do that. The problem is his internal conflict \u2013 does he protect the priests within his family or the victims of abuse?\u201d A list of 21 \u201creflection points\u201d, written by the pope and handed out on the first day of the summit, is expected to provide the basis for the development of new anti-abuse procedures for bishops. To date, many priests accused of assaulting children have simply been transferred to other parishes. Alberto Athi\u00e9 left the priesthood after church leaders ignored his reports of abuse committed by the late Marcial Maciel, a prominent Mexican priest who sexually abused several children. \u201cMy bishop told me that either I shut up or leave,\u201d said Athi\u00e9, whose testimony contributed to an investigation by the Boston Globe in 2002 into the scale of clerical sexual abuse. \u201cThey said Father Maciel was very dear and had done many good things. The church doesn\u2019t want to recognise or take responsibility for something that they have expressly hidden across the whole world.\u201d",

I enter Rifugio Meriz looking for a sandwich but instead find a menu heaving with fine mountain fare and end up ordering venison stew with fat slabs of polenta (around \u20ac12) and a local craft ale.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/feb/2019-02-20T17:15:20.html\" data-alt=\"paganella\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/feb/2019-02-20T17:15:20.html\">paganella</a> </figure>  <p>As I\u2019m discovering, quality skiing combined with gourmet food is the hallmark of Paganella, in northern Italy. This resort, at the foot of the Brenta Dolomites 90 minutes from Verona, consists of five villages, with the largest, Andalo, housing the main services and restaurants. With about 50km of pistes, Paganella is popular with Italians and skiers from eastern Europe; it\u2019s not so well-known to the British. </p> <p>I\u2019m staying in Fai della Paganella, a village that dates from pre-Roman times and retains a rural charm despite having 15 hotels (<a href=\"https://www.hotelsolea.com/en/\">Hotel Al Sole</a> has doubles from \u20ac130 B&amp;B). A ski bus links it with the area\u2019s main lift stations.</p> <p>From the top of Cima Paganella (2,125 metres), the highest point in the area, the views are stupendous. All around are towering rock needles and sheer faces, while in the valley I can see vineyards and small towns around Lake Garda.</p> <p>It\u2019s tempting to grab a coffee and flop into a deckchair at the mountaintop cafe, but there is some serious skiing to be done. This is an ideal resort for intermediate skiers: most of the runs are reds and blues. I\u2019m still finding my ski legs, so it\u2019s a relief to see that the pistes are on the wide side and not too busy, even at the weekend. As we head up the mountain in the Andalo-Doss Pel\u00e0 cable car, guide Stefania Giordan tells me that the area is known for its long runs, and for a snow-making system reckoned the best in the Dolomites.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"be3bd51c3f32b83cad66b59f0a4fe567bf0d3075\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be3bd51c3f32b83cad66b59f0a4fe567bf0d3075/0_167_5009_3005/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the snowpark and nursery slopes at Andalo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beginners please \u2026 the snowpark and nursery slopes at Andalo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leonardo Nannucci</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For beginners, there are good nursery slopes and seven ski schools, some with their own lifts, cutting out the need to buy a lift pass at first. There\u2019s plenty for families, too, as I discover when one piste leads to the Biblioigloo, an igloo-shaped high-altitude library that holds regular children\u2019s workshops. Next door is a snowpark with inflatable rings and games.</p> <p>For advanced skiers, more challenging options can be found on the black run, the Pista dei Campioni, and off-piste (the Norwegian ski team regularly trains here).</p> <p>Come evening, rather than heading to a bar, I take a quick break then pull on my boots again for a spot of night skiing. On Tuesday and Fridays, from 7pm to 11pm, Cacciatori 1, a 3km red run leading to Andalo, is floodlit.</p> <p>Skiing into what feels like a cold, brightly lit tunnel is a surreal experience. With only the slope illuminated, I soon realise I can concentrate on technique, not scenery. Thrilled by this new experience, I head straight back up for another go.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d87e87ae4c7479b6ed0e00227930b4ad73cc4991\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d87e87ae4c7479b6ed0e00227930b4ad73cc4991/0_43_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"cheese and charcuterie with mountain view  at Rifugio Dosson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View to a meal \u2026 cheese and charcuterie at Rifugio Dosson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paganella Rifugi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s still time for apr\u00e8s-ski. Lively <a href=\"https://www.paganellarifugi.it/#dosson\" title=\"\">Rifugio Dosson</a> at 1,450 metres stays open (as does the cable car) for night skiers and others. It does regional dishes such as <em>strangolapreti</em> (spinach and bread gnocchi) and fruity teroldego wine (meal with drinks around \u20ac20).

      "bodyText": "After a morning of steep mogul runs and long graceful descents through the forest, I\u2019m famished. I enter Rifugio Meriz looking for a sandwich but instead find a menu heaving with fine mountain fare and end up ordering venison stew with fat slabs of polenta (around \u20ac12) and a local craft ale. As I\u2019m discovering, quality skiing combined with gourmet food is the hallmark of Paganella, in northern Italy. This resort, at the foot of the Brenta Dolomites 90 minutes from Verona, consists of five villages, with the largest, Andalo, housing the main services and restaurants. With about 50km of pistes, Paganella is popular with Italians and skiers from eastern Europe; it\u2019s not so well-known to the British. I\u2019m staying in Fai della Paganella, a village that dates from pre-Roman times and retains a rural charm despite having 15 hotels (Hotel Al Sole has doubles from \u20ac130 B&amp;B). A ski bus links it with the area\u2019s main lift stations. From the top of Cima Paganella (2,125 metres), the highest point in the area, the views are stupendous. All around are towering rock needles and sheer faces, while in the valley I can see vineyards and small towns around Lake Garda. It\u2019s tempting to grab a coffee and flop into a deckchair at the mountaintop cafe, but there is some serious skiing to be done. This is an ideal resort for intermediate skiers: most of the runs are reds and blues. I\u2019m still finding my ski legs, so it\u2019s a relief to see that the pistes are on the wide side and not too busy, even at the weekend. As we head up the mountain in the Andalo-Doss Pel\u00e0 cable car, guide Stefania Giordan tells me that the area is known for its long runs, and for a snow-making system reckoned the best in the Dolomites. For beginners, there are good nursery slopes and seven ski schools, some with their own lifts, cutting out the need to buy a lift pass at first. There\u2019s plenty for families, too, as I discover when one piste leads to the Biblioigloo, an igloo-shaped high-altitude library that holds regular children\u2019s workshops. Next door is a snowpark with inflatable rings and games. For advanced skiers, more challenging options can be found on the black run, the Pista dei Campioni, and off-piste (the Norwegian ski team regularly trains here). Come evening, rather than heading to a bar, I take a quick break then pull on my boots again for a spot of night skiing. On Tuesday and Fridays, from 7pm to 11pm, Cacciatori 1, a 3km red run leading to Andalo, is floodlit. Skiing into what feels like a cold, brightly lit tunnel is a surreal experience. With only the slope illuminated, I soon realise I can concentrate on technique, not scenery. Thrilled by this new experience, I head straight back up for another go. There\u2019s still time for apr\u00e8s-ski. Lively Rifugio Dosson at 1,450 metres stays open (as does the cable car) for night skiers and others. It does regional dishes such as strangolapreti (spinach and bread gnocchi) and fruity teroldego wine (meal with drinks around \u20ac20). Afterwards I opt to ski back, savouring the chance to have the slopes almost to myself as I hurtle towards the lights of the village. Night skiing is perfect for those wishing to pack in as much slope time as possible, especially on a short break. For longer visits, activities include ski touring, snowshoeing and fat-biking, plus the chance to visit Trento, the ancient capital of the Trentino region, half an hour away. The city\u2019s place in history was secured in the mid-16th century when it was the site of the Council of Trent \u2013 the Catholic Counter-Reformation. For centuries, it was a point where north and south Europe met to trade, and was part of Austria until being annexed by Italy in 1919. On cobbled streets, historical periods intermingle. The central piazza has a Romanesque-Gothic cathedral, frescoed 16th-century buildings, and Buonconsiglio Castle, dating from the 13th century. There are ancient Roman cellars under the Michelin-starred Scrigno del Duomo restaurant. I check out the independent shops, a Sunday market and great bars such as Caff\u00e8 Excelsior, where I order a glass of Trentodoc, the sparkling wine. Trento isn\u2019t all ancient architecture though: the Museo delle Scienze, a popular, award-winning science museum, opened in 2013. Designed by Renzo Piano, it has steeply angled, glazed roof plates recalling the shapes of the surrounding mountains, and as I try to fit both into a photograph, I realise what a special place Paganella is.

It deceives you \u2026 from the top you think there\u2019s going to be loads of raisins, but when you cut into it, there\u2019s not. The custard has a citrus vibe. I don\u2019t like this. \u2605 Co-op pain aux raisins \u00a31 each, food.coop.co.uk Looks depressing; the custard looks luminous. Some of the raisins seem burned and I think it\u2019s undercooked in the middle. 0 stars Pains au chocolat Waitrose 1 pain au chocolat \u00a31.55 for 2, waitrose.com The flake is banging. Hmm, I\u2019ve been shortchanged\u2026 the chocolate isn\u2019t filling the whole hole. The taste is good, though. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Starbucks pain au chocolat \u00a31.85 each, starbucks.co.uk A nice golden colour on top, evenly baked, chocolate poking out on both sides. It\u2019s a bit soft. There\u2019s loads of pockets in there, but it\u2019s not flaky. Does the job, but a bit forgettable. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Tesco all butter pain au chocolat \u00a31.25 for 4, tesco.com It\u2019s got a decent flake. Smells nice, I can taste the dark chocolate but the richness of the butter is not there. The chocolate is solid. \u2605\u2605 Brioche Pasquier pain au chocolat \u00a31.75 for 6, ocado.com This looks like a sausage roll from Greggs. Inside, it looks more like a bread loaf with chocolate. It tastes like bread. It\u2019s not the one, not good. No offence. \u2605 Jam doughnuts Marks &amp; Spencer raspberry jam doughnut 50p each, marksandspencer.com Good proportions \u2013 sugar coating, dough, jam. If anything it could be fluffier but it\u2019s still the fluffiest. Tastes like it was fried this morning. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Asda Baker\u2019s Selection jam doughnuts 79p for 5, asda.com Every doughnut should have an aeration ring \u2026 this kind of has it. Looks like a jam bap. The jam to dough ratio is pretty sound but the jam is really too sweet... and I like sweet stuff. \u2605\u2605 Essential Waitrose raspberry jam doughnuts \u00a31 for 4, waitrose.com This looks like it\u2019s had time to do its thing; a solid aeration ring and it\u2019s covered in more sugar. The jam is on the tight side. The dough is not really that nice, not airy. \u2605\u2605 Co-op jam doughnuts 75p for 5, food.coop.co.uk It looks like the last one in the pack, there\u2019s no love in it. The colour doesn\u2019t look right either. A bit doughy, that jam doesn\u2019t taste like anything \u2026 just sugar. \u2605 Blueberry muffins Marks &amp; Spencer blueberry filled muffin \u00a31 each, marksandspencer.com Ohh! They put a bit of blueberry jam in the middle! This changed the game. Powerful. The blueberries are evenly distributed too \u2026 and it\u2019s in the tulip wrap that I like AND it tastes nice. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Co-op blueberry muffin \u00a31 for 4, food.coop.co.uk Strangely blue in the middle \u2013 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough blueberries to make it this colour. But well baked. \u2605\u2605 Waitrose wild blueberry muffins \u00a31.75 for 2, waitrose.com Looks like there\u2019s a bit of crumble on top. These look like legit blueberries. It has a weird sour taste to it. \u2605\u2605 Tesco blueberry muffins \u00a31.20 for 4, tesco.com They look too blue to me. Smells like blueberries, though. The colour is even, apart from around the edges \u2026 but there are hardly any blueberries in it. No. \u2605 Sultana scones Sainsbury\u2019s Taste the Difference sultana scones \u00a31.50 for 4, sainsburys.com Good colour. Doesn\u2019t taste bad at all. It\u2019s not doughy, easy to break apart. But it\u2019s a scone for people who don\u2019t really like sultanas. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Waitrose all butter sultana scones \u00a31.65 for 4, waitrose.com I like this one, it\u2019s big, rustic, well baked \u2026 you can tell someone called Margaret made this. It looked like it was going to be insane but, when it came down to the taste, not that great. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Aldi Village Bakery sultana scones 79p for 6, aldi.co.uk This one is sad, colour is not great, looks more like a rock cake. The distribution of fruit is pretty decent, breaks apart nicely, doesn\u2019t seem over-mixed. Tastes OK. \u2605\u2605 Becky\u2019s Bakery sultana scones 50p for 4, iceland.co.uk No height, which is sad because I love to slice a scone in half. Good distribution of fruit but I think that\u2019s because they\u2019re so small. Taste-wise, it does the job \u2026 but meh. \u2605\u2605 Liam Charles is a columnist for The Guardian\u2019s Feast",

      "bodyText": "The luxury car firm Aston Martin Lagonda is gearing up for its first set of financial results since a disappointing stock market float. It will present full-year figures on Thursday, having seen its shares slump 36% since the October 2018 float. The slow-motion slide has left the 106-year-old company with a stock market value of less than \u00a33bn, compared to its pre-listing target of \u00a35bn. Despite the lacklustre share trajectory, Aston Martin\u2019s financial performance has been strong since the float, with third-quarter figures showing an 81% increase in year-on-year revenue to \u00a3282m and a 93% increase in underlying profit to \u00a354.4m. At the time, the chief executive, Andy Palmer, said the company\u2019s profitability since the start of the year put it on course to meet full-year targets, helping to fund the development of new models such as the crossover model DBX, to be built at its new factory in St Athan, south Wales. Aston Martin\u2019s wealthier clientele means it is insulated from the grim economic conditions facing more mass-market carmakers, which are wrestling with a global capacity glut, stagnant consumer demand and the need to invest in electric vehicle development. But it has said it is not immune to the dangers posed by Brexit, particularly a no-deal scenario, joining carmakers such as Honda, Toyota, Nissan and BMW in sounding the alarm. The company has drawn up contingency plans to cope with a potentially disorderly Brexit, including hiring a new supply chain chief and preparing to fly in components or bring them in via naval ports. With just over a month to go, the company is expected to face further questions about the effect of a no-deal scenario, which its chief financial officer, Mark Wilson, told the business select committee in 2017 would be \u201csemi-catastrophic\u201d for the company. In the run-up to last year\u2019s stock market float, Aston Martin showed off its plans to boost revenue by selling luxury goods such as apartments and even personal submarines, under the stewardship of Marek Reichman, chief creative officer.",

He pleaded for patience after fans booed his team off following Saturday\u2019s defeat \u2013 their fourth in a row at home \u2013 but the club\u2019s board decided he had already had enough time to try to arrest a worrying slide.</p> \n<p>Although Leicester sit 12th in the Premier League, within reach of their minimum pre-season target of a top-half finish, an increasing number of supporters, and some players, lost faith in the manager\u2019s ability to inspire an upturn.</p> \n<p>Last week Puel held talks with Kasper Schmeichel to discuss claims made on television by the goalkeeper\u2019s father, Peter, that the player wanted to leave. In the same interview the elder Schmeichel also said \u201c[Leicester] have good players, they just don\u2019t have a manager who can get the best out of them.\u201d Puel said on Friday that Kasper indicated his intention to stay. Perhaps that is even more likely now Puel has left.</p> \n<p>Puel\u2019s departure marks a disappointing end for a manager who made a good first impression after taking over from Craig Shakespeare in 2017 despite the fact that his appointment did not meet with much support from people who said his style of play was so dull that Southampton had been right to sack him the previous season. Leicester fans eventually formed a similar view, although there were tantalising moments when Puel\u2019s team played very well.</p> \n<p>Even this season he oversaw excellent individual performances by young players such as James Maddison and Ben Chillwell and produced strong displays against the Premier League\u2019s top teams, including Manchester City, whom they beat 2-1 on Boxing Day.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Off the field, although most supporters never developed real affection for him, the manager as universally praised for the dignified way he represented the club following the death of Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha in October.</p> \n<p>Leicester\u2019s persistent failings on the pitch, however, mean most Leicester fans welcomed the decision to oust him. Leicester have not won at home since that rousing victory over Pep Guardiola\u2019s side, instead falling to defeats at the King Power by teams such as Cardiff City, Southampton and Palace. If, as Puel maintained, progress was being made, it was not happening fast enough.

He pleaded for patience after fans booed his team off following Saturday\u2019s defeat \u2013 their fourth in a row at home \u2013 but the club\u2019s board decided he had already had enough time to try to arrest a worrying slide. Although Leicester sit 12th in the Premier League, within reach of their minimum pre-season target of a top-half finish, an increasing number of supporters, and some players, lost faith in the manager\u2019s ability to inspire an upturn. Last week Puel held talks with Kasper Schmeichel to discuss claims made on television by the goalkeeper\u2019s father, Peter, that the player wanted to leave. In the same interview the elder Schmeichel also said \u201c[Leicester] have good players, they just don\u2019t have a manager who can get the best out of them.\u201d Puel said on Friday that Kasper indicated his intention to stay. Perhaps that is even more likely now Puel has left. Puel\u2019s departure marks a disappointing end for a manager who made a good first impression after taking over from Craig Shakespeare in 2017 despite the fact that his appointment did not meet with much support from people who said his style of play was so dull that Southampton had been right to sack him the previous season. Leicester fans eventually formed a similar view, although there were tantalising moments when Puel\u2019s team played very well. Even this season he oversaw excellent individual performances by young players such as James Maddison and Ben Chillwell and produced strong displays against the Premier League\u2019s top teams, including Manchester City, whom they beat 2-1 on Boxing Day. Off the field, although most supporters never developed real affection for him, the manager as universally praised for the dignified way he represented the club following the death of Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha in October. Leicester\u2019s persistent failings on the pitch, however, mean most Leicester fans welcomed the decision to oust him. Leicester have not won at home since that rousing victory over Pep Guardiola\u2019s side, instead falling to defeats at the King Power by teams such as Cardiff City, Southampton and Palace. If, as Puel maintained, progress was being made, it was not happening fast enough. Leicester\u2019s patience ran out.",

He goes about breaking as many rules as he can while investigating her case, trying to find out \u201cwhat happened to shape her, make her the person she became, a person capable of murder\u201d. The narration moves between Theo\u2019s current-day work with Alicia, and Alicia\u2019s old diary, in which she has helpfully recounted every detail of every conversation she has had (\u201c\u2018Sorry?\u2019 I said. \u2018Can you repeat that?\u2019\u201d) in a remarkably unnatural manner. This is a debut with grand ambitions, and while it may fall short of them, it provides a satisfyingly sinister twist at the last.",

      "body": "<p><strong>What first inspired you to become a war doctor?</strong><br>Two things. The first was Roland Joff\u00e9\u2019s film <em>The Killing Fields</em>, which had a huge impact on me when I saw it as a trainee surgeon. There is a scene in a hospital in Phnom Penh, overrun with patients, where a surgeon has to deal with a shrapnel injury \u2013 I wanted to be that surgeon. The second big spur was watching news footage from Sarajevo back in 1993. There was this man on the television, looking desperately through the rubble for his daughter. Eventually he found her and took her to the hospital but there were no doctors there to help her. I thought, \u201cRight, I\u2019m off\u201d.</p> \n<p><strong>What was that first experience of war like?</strong><br>As a young man, jumping off the aeroplane and running for cover, then hopping into a bulletproof vehicle and being taken at high speed to the hospital was <em>Boy\u2019s Own</em> stuff, just how I wanted it to be. It was perfect. The adrenaline was overpowering and the amount of endorphins in your head \u2013 I felt like I was floating on air and could do anything. Then to be able to help people as well, having your own operating theatre, it was wonderful. Of course, then I wanted to replicate it all the time. Once I had tasted that, I couldn\u2019t stop.</p> \n<p><strong>Is that adrenaline rush still as strong, 25 years on?</strong><br>Nowadays, I am driven less by wanting to fix individual patients and more by wanting to impart the knowledge and expertise I have built up over the years to local doctors on the ground. I was in Yemen recently and there were simple medical procedures \u2013 life-saving procedures \u2013 that the doctors were getting wrong because they had not seen them before. Most doctors rarely see war injuries any more. Everybody has forgotten how blast injuries affect children, what gunshot wounds or the shockwave effects of big bombs dropping do to people. That is why it is important for me to keep doing this and why I set up my foundation [<a href=\"https://davidnottfoundation.com/\" title=\"\">the David Nott Foundation</a>] to provide surgical training for doctors from all over the world in how to work in austere environments [war and disaster zones].</p> \n<p><strong>What makes a good war doctor?</strong><br>You have to know a bit of everything \u2013 neurosurgery, maxillofacial surgery, chest surgery, abdominal surgery, orthopaedics, plastics, paediatrics, how to deliver a baby. You need to be able to make decisions about what is right for the patient without recourse to hi-tech investigations such as CT scanners, or x-ray machines, which are few and far between on the frontline.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5f3e0fcf-d742-41e4-8eea-f5c67efbc9c6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j2dyktjdmUs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>How big a problem is PTSD for war doctors?</strong><br>Really big. I was never quite right when I came back, especially if I had done a two- or three-month mission. I became more irritable and aggressive for a while as I decompressed and readjusted to London life. But it was after meeting Elly and that last mission to Syria that it all became too much. I still very much want to go to challenging places and help people. I have to, I find it almost a calling. But I am more savvy now, I know what not to do. I know when some places are too dangerous to go to.</p> \n<p><strong>Would you say you are an emotional person?</strong><br>Yes, I am a very emotional person. Early on, working in war zones, I did develop this kind of icy heart. I didn\u2019t want any relationships, I didn\u2019t want anybody to get close to me because then I wouldn\u2019t be able to carry on doing what I was doing, and that was all I wanted to do. That is the thing that has changed most about me since having my two daughters.</p> \n<p><strong>Are you comfortable being in the limelight?</strong><br>No, not at all. And I am aware this book will thrust me into it. But I wrote it to bear witness. [My friend] Ammar and the other doctors in Syria said I had to write it because without it, their voices would never be heard and nobody would ever know really what happened.</p>",

      "bodyText": "What first inspired you to become a war doctor? Two things. The first was Roland Joff\u00e9\u2019s film The Killing Fields, which had a huge impact on me when I saw it as a trainee surgeon. There is a scene in a hospital in Phnom Penh, overrun with patients, where a surgeon has to deal with a shrapnel injury \u2013 I wanted to be that surgeon. The second big spur was watching news footage from Sarajevo back in 1993. There was this man on the television, looking desperately through the rubble for his daughter. Eventually he found her and took her to the hospital but there were no doctors there to help her. I thought, \u201cRight, I\u2019m off\u201d. What was that first experience of war like? As a young man, jumping off the aeroplane and running for cover, then hopping into a bulletproof vehicle and being taken at high speed to the hospital was Boy\u2019s Own stuff, just how I wanted it to be. It was perfect. The adrenaline was overpowering and the amount of endorphins in your head \u2013 I felt like I was floating on air and could do anything. Then to be able to help people as well, having your own operating theatre, it was wonderful. Of course, then I wanted to replicate it all the time. Once I had tasted that, I couldn\u2019t stop. Is that adrenaline rush still as strong, 25 years on? Nowadays, I am driven less by wanting to fix individual patients and more by wanting to impart the knowledge and expertise I have built up over the years to local doctors on the ground. I was in Yemen recently and there were simple medical procedures \u2013 life-saving procedures \u2013 that the doctors were getting wrong because they had not seen them before. Most doctors rarely see war injuries any more. Everybody has forgotten how blast injuries affect children, what gunshot wounds or the shockwave effects of big bombs dropping do to people. That is why it is important for me to keep doing this and why I set up my foundation [the David Nott Foundation] to provide surgical training for doctors from all over the world in how to work in austere environments [war and disaster zones]. What makes a good war doctor? You have to know a bit of everything \u2013 neurosurgery, maxillofacial surgery, chest surgery, abdominal surgery, orthopaedics, plastics, paediatrics, how to deliver a baby. You need to be able to make decisions about what is right for the patient without recourse to hi-tech investigations such as CT scanners, or x-ray machines, which are few and far between on the frontline. How big a problem is PTSD for war doctors? Really big. I was never quite right when I came back, especially if I had done a two- or three-month mission. I became more irritable and aggressive for a while as I decompressed and readjusted to London life. But it was after meeting Elly and that last mission to Syria that it all became too much. I still very much want to go to challenging places and help people. I have to, I find it almost a calling. But I am more savvy now, I know what not to do. I know when some places are too dangerous to go to. Would you say you are an emotional person? Yes, I am a very emotional person. Early on, working in war zones, I did develop this kind of icy heart. I didn\u2019t want any relationships, I didn\u2019t want anybody to get close to me because then I wouldn\u2019t be able to carry on doing what I was doing, and that was all I wanted to do. That is the thing that has changed most about me since having my two daughters. Are you comfortable being in the limelight? No, not at all. And I am aware this book will thrust me into it. But I wrote it to bear witness. [My friend] Ammar and the other doctors in Syria said I had to write it because without it, their voices would never be heard and nobody would ever know really what happened.",

      "body": "<p>Anti-Zionism is antisemitism. So claimed France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/feb/21/emmanuel-macron-says-france-antisemitism-has-reached-worst-levels-since-second-world-war\" title=\"\">speech</a> last week in which he promised to change policing regulations to criminalise anti-Zionism.</p> <p>The condemnation of anti-Zionism as antisemitism has a long history, but in recent years has become increasingly accepted by mainstream politicians and organisations. This shift in perspective has taken place against the background of rising antisemitism, from physical attacks to racist tweets, fuelled by both the resurgence of the far-right and the growth of antisemitism on the left. Particularly in sections of the left, anti-Zionism has more and more appropriated, often unrecognised, antisemitic tropes.</p> <p>All this is undeniably true. Yet, it remains important to resist the equation of anti-Zionism and antisemitism.</p> <p>Critics of anti-Zionism observe that Zionism simply expresses the right of Jewish people to self-determination. Just as other peoples, from Armenians to Zimbabweans, have the right to self-determination, so do Jews. To deny that is antisemitic because it is to deny Jews the rights accorded to others. However, the issue is more complex. When Scots voted in their independence referendum in 2016, all residents of Scotland who were over 16, and were British, EU or Commonwealth citizens, had the right to vote. The right to self-determination did not extend to all those of Scottish ancestry living outside Scotland.</p> <p>The Zionist notion of \u201cself-determination\u201d, on the other hand, embodies the idea that Jews anywhere in the world \u201cself-determine\u201d and that such self-determination relates to a state in which the vast majority of Jews do not and will not live.</p> <p>Zionism is a form of ethnic, as opposed to civic, nationalism. The distinction between the two is fiercely contested, and often blurred. Many modern states fuse elements of both in nationality and immigration laws. Nevertheless, the distinction between civic and ethnic nationalism is important because they embody contrasting conceptions of national belonging, citizenship, equality and rights.</p> <p>Israel itself combines aspects of civic and ethnic nationalism. As the late historian <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/contributors/judt-tony/\" title=\"\">Tony Judt</a> put it in an essay for the <em>New York Review of Books</em>, Israel is both a democracy in which non-Jews can be citizens and \u201ca state in which Jews and the Jewish religion have exclusive privileges from which non-Jewish citizens are forever excluded\u201d and from which Palestinians grievously suffer. Judt faced great opprobrium for that essay, with many reviling him as \u201cantisemitic\u201d or a \u201cself-hating Jew\u201d.</p> <p>To oppose Zionism but not other forms of ethnic nationalism would indeed be antisemitic.

      "bodyText": "Anti-Zionism is antisemitism. So claimed France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron in a speech last week in which he promised to change policing regulations to criminalise anti-Zionism. The condemnation of anti-Zionism as antisemitism has a long history, but in recent years has become increasingly accepted by mainstream politicians and organisations. This shift in perspective has taken place against the background of rising antisemitism, from physical attacks to racist tweets, fuelled by both the resurgence of the far-right and the growth of antisemitism on the left. Particularly in sections of the left, anti-Zionism has more and more appropriated, often unrecognised, antisemitic tropes. All this is undeniably true. Yet, it remains important to resist the equation of anti-Zionism and antisemitism. Critics of anti-Zionism observe that Zionism simply expresses the right of Jewish people to self-determination. Just as other peoples, from Armenians to Zimbabweans, have the right to self-determination, so do Jews. To deny that is antisemitic because it is to deny Jews the rights accorded to others. However, the issue is more complex. When Scots voted in their independence referendum in 2016, all residents of Scotland who were over 16, and were British, EU or Commonwealth citizens, had the right to vote. The right to self-determination did not extend to all those of Scottish ancestry living outside Scotland. The Zionist notion of \u201cself-determination\u201d, on the other hand, embodies the idea that Jews anywhere in the world \u201cself-determine\u201d and that such self-determination relates to a state in which the vast majority of Jews do not and will not live. Zionism is a form of ethnic, as opposed to civic, nationalism. The distinction between the two is fiercely contested, and often blurred. Many modern states fuse elements of both in nationality and immigration laws. Nevertheless, the distinction between civic and ethnic nationalism is important because they embody contrasting conceptions of national belonging, citizenship, equality and rights. Israel itself combines aspects of civic and ethnic nationalism. As the late historian Tony Judt put it in an essay for the New York Review of Books, Israel is both a democracy in which non-Jews can be citizens and \u201ca state in which Jews and the Jewish religion have exclusive privileges from which non-Jewish citizens are forever excluded\u201d and from which Palestinians grievously suffer. Judt faced great opprobrium for that essay, with many reviling him as \u201cantisemitic\u201d or a \u201cself-hating Jew\u201d. To oppose Zionism but not other forms of ethnic nationalism would indeed be antisemitic. But to oppose Zionism because one opposes ethnic nationalism is a legitimate view. Judt, who in early life was a Zionist, came eventually to accept that the only lasting solution would be a single, secular state in which both Jews and Palestinians were treated equally. For anti-Zionists like Judt, \u201cself-determination\u201d in that piece of contested land that is Israel/Palestine should adhere to principles of civic, not ethnic, nationalism; that is, be the self-determination of the people, and only the people, who live there, whether Jews or Palestinians. This kind of anti-Zionism is very different from that which calls for the \u201cdestruction of the state of Israel\u201d, usually (a not very veiled) code for the destruction of Jews. The latter is a form of anti-Zionism that refuses to acknowledge the presence of more than 6 million Jews in Israel/Palestine, whose rights, needs and aspirations are as central as those of Palestinians to any discussion of the region\u2019s future. There are, in other words, many forms of anti-Zionism, some progressive, some antisemitic. What has shifted is that leftwing ideas of anti-Zionism have become increasingly colonised by antisemitic forms. The reasons are complex, ranging from evolving notions of \u201canti-imperialism\u201d to the mainstreaming of conspiracy theories. One key development that has helped foster the shift is the growth of the politics of identity and of the tendency to see \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d in terms of the group to which someone belongs and the privileges that they are supposed to possess. Identity politics has led many to target Jews for being Jews, especially as they are seen as belonging to a group with many privileges to check, and to hold all Jews responsible for the actions of the state of Israel. Many who support the Palestinian cause, including many within the Labour party, seem genuinely unable to distinguish between criticising Israel and sowing hatred against a people. The elision of anti-Zionism and antisemitism is a feature, then, of both sides of the debate. On the one side, it helps to legitimise antisemitism, on the other to close down debates about Israel and to criminalise genuine struggles for Palestinian rights. We should reject both. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "A late surge in momentum for Richard E Grant ahead of Sunday night\u2019s Oscars peaked on Saturday with victory at the Film Independent Spirit Awards. The actor, 61, said he was \u201cabsolutely astonished and emotional\u201d to have won in a category also containing Paul Castillo for We The Animals, Adam Driver for BlacKkKlansman, Josh Hamilton for Eighth Grade and John David Washington for Monsters And Men. Grant told the audience he was third choice for the part of Jack Hock, a hard-drinking friend to Melissa McCarthy\u2019s literary forger, behind Sam Rockwell and Chris O\u2019Dowd, and that his casting was \u201carbitrary and it\u2019s luck\u201d. Hock is diagnosed with HIV in Can You Ever Forgive Me?, and Grant said the role was an \u201chomage\u201d to men \u201cwiped out by that disease\u201d. He said his portrayal of Hock was inspired by Scottish actor and star of Chariots of Fire Ian Charleson, a family friend of Grant\u2019s who died aged 40 in 1990 after being diagnosed with Aids. Grant\u2019s win sets up a tantalising showdown for the best supporting actor gong at the Oscars, with Mahershala Ali still the narrow favourite for his turn in Green Book. It was not Can You Ever Forgive Me?\u2019s only win of the night, with Nicole Holofcener and Jeff Whitty taking home the best screenplay award. If Beale Street Could Talk, Barry Jenkins\u2019 drama based on James Baldwin\u2019s 1974 novel, won best feature, the main award of the night. Jenkins, whose film is not nominated for best picture at the Oscars, also won best director. Held each year to celebrate the best in independent film, the ceremony took place in a tent on Santa Monica beach a day before the Academy Awards. Glenn Close, who attended with her dog, Pip, took best actress for her role in The Wife. Close, who has never won an Oscar, is also favourite to clinch the big prize. Pip, a white Havanese, who also joined Close on the blue carpet before the event, trotted up to the stage alongside her and had the audience in uproarious laughter as he rolled on the floor while his famous owner paid tribute to her fellow nominees. Bo Burnham, who was also snubbed at the Oscars but had joy at both the writers and directors guild of America awards, picked up the prize for best first screenplay for coming-of-age drama Eighth Grade. Best male lead went to Ethan Hawke for First Reformed, a drama in which he plays a Protestant minister grappling with his faith. Best international film went to Alfonso Cuaron\u2019s black-and-white semi-biographical picture Roma \u2013 and the filmmaker immediately predicted the growing diversity in the industry would make the category obsolete. The Netflix film has enjoyed tremendous success this awards season and is heavy favourite to win best picture at the Oscars on Sunday. Accepting the prize on stage, Mexican film-maker Cuaron said he is \u201coptimistic\u201d about diversity in Hollywood and that it could soon mean there is no need for an international film category. Speaking backstage, he laughed off questions about having multiple acceptance speeches ready for the Oscars, where Roma leads the way in nominations with 10. Best supporting female went to Regina King for her role in If Beale Street Could Talk. King is also nominated for an Oscar. The Truer Than Fiction Award, presented each year to the emerging director of a non-fiction feature, was awarded to Bing Liu for Minding The Gap. Boots Riley picked up the prize for best first feature for his dark comedy Sorry To Bother You. Best documentary went to Won\u2019t You Be My Neighbor?, which examines the life and legacy of beloved US children\u2019s TV host Fred Rogers \u2013 also nominated for an Oscar. The prizes were handed out by non-profit organisation Film Independent, comprising actors, film-makers and critics. The Oscars take place on Sunday night in Los Angeles.

If I get 10 minutes into a TV show and find it excruciatingly dull, I will say no, even if the arts pages and social media tell me I must watch it.

I swerve events that will bore me; parties where I know I will end up drinking too much, or taking drugs, and then feel awful the next day. If I get 10 minutes into a TV show and find it excruciatingly dull, I will say no, even if the arts pages and social media tell me I must watch it. I will abandon a book if it is awful, when in the past I felt it some kind of failure to not crack a spine fully. I cannot tell you the change that swapping \u201cOK\u201d for \u201cno\u201d can make. This isn\u2019t about turning into someone selfish, or hermetic, or rude. We must all occasionally do things we wouldn\u2019t otherwise choose to: in order to be a good friend, to be professional, to survive. But saying no is about paying attention to the physical and psychological effects of our commitments. It\u2019s about guarding against burnout, low self-esteem and regret. Saying no will at first seem a big thing. But, as with anything, practice makes it easier. It brings the quiet confidence of control, the thrill of self-care. A pride in putting oneself first. It is the joy of freedom, even if it\u2019s simply the freedom of proclaiming that that brunch place is awful, you have always hated it, and you will never, ever set foot in there again.",

      "body": "<p>About seven years ago, researchers at the US DNA sequencing company <a href=\"https://www.illumina.com/\" title=\"\">Illumina</a> started to notice something odd. A new blood test it ran on 125,000 expectant mothers looking for genetic abnormalities such as Down\u2019s syndrome in their foetuses returned some extremely unexpected signals in 10 cases. Chillingly, it dawned on them that the abnormal DNA they were seeing wasn\u2019t from the foetuses but was, rather, undiagnosed cancer in the mothers. Cancers of different types were later confirmed in all 10. \u201cThis was not a test developed for cancer screening,\u201d says Alex Aravanis, then Illumina\u2019s senior R&amp;D director. \u201cBut it was evidence that it might be possible.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, Illumina created Silicon Valley-based spin-off company <a href=\"https://grail.com/\" title=\"\">Grail</a>, with Aravanis as chief scientific officer. Backed by more than $1.5bn in funding, including money from Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Grail is on a quest to detect multiple types of cancer before symptoms, via a single, simple blood test. The test looks at cell-free plasma to find fragments of so-called circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) sloughed off by cancer cells.</p> <p>Detecting cancer sooner \u2013 before symptoms \u2013 means you can intervene earlier and people are less likely to die. While doctors can screen for breast, colon and lung cancer, most varieties of the disease can only be detected after symptoms appear. And though it is far from the only approach, the beauty of blood is that it is minimally invasive to collect. \u201cA relatively simple blood-based test that can screen for evidence of cancer\u2026 might improve or even replace some screening programmes over time,\u201d says Jacqui Shaw, professor of translational cancer genetics at the University of Leicester, who studies ctDNA. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/23/bowel-cancer-trial-aims-to-reset-gut-bacteria\">Bowel cancer trial aims to reset gut bacteria</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Looking for ctDNA has become a viable proposition in recent years because of improvements in DNA sequencing technologies that make it possible to scan fragments and find those few with alterations that may indicate cancer. While other blood-based biomarkers are being investigated, the advantage of ctDNA is that, because it has a direct link to the tumour, it can be very specific at identifying cancer. For that reason, ctDNA is also showing promise as a way to profile and monitor advanced stage cancers, a \u201cliquid biopsy\u201d.</p> <p>Early detection is a harder problem. Early on, when the tumour is small, there is not as much ctDNA to detect. The women Illumina identified as having cancer were all late, not early stage.</p> <p>To date, there is one company offering a blood test based on ctDNA for early cancer detection: <a href=\"https://www.epigenomics.com\" title=\"\">Epigenomics</a> began offering its test for colon cancer in 2016 based on detecting biochemical modification of a single gene.</p> <p>But the dream being imagined by Grail and others is an inexpensive test, perhaps no more than $500, which could conceivably be given annually to those over a certain age, with a high chance of detecting many cancers at once with high accuracy (Grail hasn\u2019t announced a final number but thinks it will be in the region of 10). It\u2019s a test that all of us, if it works, could one day get. \u201cThe big studies are still to be done,\u201d says Nitzan Rosenfeld, a researcher who studies ctDNA at the <a href=\"https://www.cruk.cam.ac.uk\" title=\"\">Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute</a> and a cofounder of the UK-based liquid biopsy company <a href=\"https://www.inivata.com/\" title=\"\">Inivata</a>, \u201cbut there has been considerable progress.\u201d</p> <p>Cancer essentially begins when a normal cell\u2019s DNA gets mutated or altered. From that point, the cell multiplies too often and a mass or tumour of abnormal cells forms. A proportion of the cells invariably die and \u201cshed\u201d genetic material into the bloodstream, mixing with larger amounts of DNA fragments coming from the death of normal cells.</p> <p>It was first reported that fragments of DNA carrying cancer-causing mutations could be found floating freely in the blood of cancer patients in the mid-1990s. The findings caught the attention of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/sep/01/dennis-lo-prenatal-research-cancer\" title=\"\">Dennis Lo</a>, now a professor of medicine and chemical pathology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who thought that \u201ca baby living in a mother is a little bit like a cancer growing in a patient\u201d. Based on that insight, he went on to discover foetal DNA fragments in maternal blood and to pioneer non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) (he licensed his patents to Illumina and other companies). He also began, along with others, to apply those insights to how ctDNA fragments might be used in the monitoring and detection of cancer. In 2017, Grail merged with Lo\u2019s company, Cirina, also aimed at early detection.</p> <p>Grail\u2019s competitors include <a href=\"https://guardanthealth.com/\" title=\"\">Guardant Health</a>, a liquid biopsy company valued at $3.5bn that was founded in 2011 and is also based in Silicon Valley. It recently branched out to work on an early-detection test for four common cancers: lung, breast, colorectal and ovarian.</p> <p>There are also multiple academic efforts with designs on commercialisation. Last year, researchers at Johns Hopkins University school of medicine published details of a potential blood test called <a href=\"https://hub.jhu.edu/2018/01/19/cancer-blood-test-johns-hopkins/\" title=\"\">CancerSEEK</a> that covers eight cancers. And in December last year, University of Queensland researchers made headlines with a \u201c10-minute test\u201d they have called a <a href=\"https://prostatecancerinfolink.net/2018/12/06/the-development-of-a-10-minute-cancer-test-the-methylscape/\" title=\"\">methylscape </a>and which they say could potentially give a yes or no answer to the presence of cancer in the body, though it wouldn\u2019t identify its location.</p> <p>Each group or company has or is developing a way of detecting ctDNA. Grail and Guardant\u2019s tests are based on sequencing the cell-free DNA. This can look for mutations, increases in the number of chromosomes or genes or unusual biochemical changes known as epigenetic changes, all of which can occur in the DNA of cancer cells. Grail has been experimenting with all three but hasn\u2019t announced which method its final test will use. Guardant\u2019s method takes them all in. CancerSEEK, meanwhile, looks for a small number of mutations as well as protein markers known to increase in particular cancers. The small mutation panel keeps costs down says Nickolas Papadopoulos, a professor of oncology who is co-leading work on the latter method. Instead of sequencing, methylscapes use gold nanoparticles to detect epigenetic alterations.</p> <p>Results have been published or presented for all these methods, demonstrating that cancer-related signals can be seen. They are based on small studies of 1,000 people or fewer with cancer at various stages. The key for the tests is achieving both a high likelihood of detection (a good sensitivity) and a low false positive rate to avoid needless anxiety and unnecessary follow-up. (In a test being designed for a general population, where cancer actually isn\u2019t very prevalent, the latter is particularly important because even low false positive rates will result in a substantial number of incorrect diagnoses.)</p> <p>Grail\u2019s best detection rates, based on a prototype test for detecting epigenetic changes, ranged from 80% down to 47% for nine cancers (respectively ovarian, liver, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, pancreatic, colorectal, oesophageal, head and neck and lung). Breast cancer ranged from 56% to 11% depending on the type. The false positive rate was set at 2%, though says Aravanis, further work suggests it could hit less than 1%. \u201cFrom a single test, we detected a large fraction of the highest mortality cancers in early stage with very high specificity,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6fedc45b20587205476b081e37163cd119791987\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fedc45b20587205476b081e37163cd119791987/0_112_1500_1874/800.jpg\" alt=\"Eleftherios Diamandis\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eleftherios Diamandis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ww.nature.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of Grail\u2019s competitors, CancerSEEK\u2019s sensitivity ranged from 98% for ovarian cancer to 33% for breast cancer with a false positive rate of less than 1%. <a href=\"http://investors.guardanthealth.com/node/6336/html\" title=\"\">Guardant showed</a> it could detect lung cancer in 71% of cases and colorectal cancer in 67% of cases with a false positive rate of 2%. Methylscape meanwhile had a sensitivity of 90% but the false positive rate was higher at 10 to 15%.</p> <p>Yet while the companies are bullish about what they are seeing, not everyone is convinced. Eleftherios Diamandis, professor of clinical biochemistry at the University of Toronto, has made a name for himself criticising grand designs for revolutionary blood tests. Well before the media questioned the validity of startup company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/15/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-ramesh-balwani-criminal-charges\" title=\"\">Theranos</a>\u2019s blood-testing technology \u2013 the firm and its chief executive were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/14/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-fraud-charge\" title=\"\">charged last year with \u201cmassive fraud\u201d</a> by the US Securities and Exchange Commission \u2013 Diamandis had raised doubts in the scientific literature. </p> <p>Last year, he and his associate Clare Fiala published a series of journal pieces <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6167864/\" title=\"\">questioning how useful ctDNA could really be</a> in early cancer diagnosis. Diamandis\u2019s calculations, based on experimental literature data, give a sense of the size of tumour a ctDNA-based blood test might be able to pick up. His work indicates that with the technology available for analysing ctDNA, tumours would need to be approximately 1cm in diameter or greater to be detected. \u201cThat is a fairly large tumour,\u201d he says. There is simply unlikely to be a single fragment of DNA from tumours under that size in the 10ml of blood that is a standard sample. While more blood may help a little, it would make things much less pleasant.</p> <p>As Diamandis sees things, the tests do seem to be performing well, but that is because they are being applied to people who have already been diagnosed with cancer. \u201cIf you go to a real population of asymptomatic individuals, their success rate will be, predictably in my opinion, much less,\u201d he says. \u201cFor the [multi-cancer] blood test \u2013 as of today \u2013 I am relatively pessimistic.\u201d</p> <p>For their part, the groups and companies acknowledge that large studies in people without diagnosed cancer are what is needed next. CancerSEEK is looking to enrol 10,000 women without known cancer to take its blood test; it will then follow them over five years to see whether they develop cancer. And Grail has two large, long-running studies of those who are asymptomatic, one of 100,000 and another of 50,000, in the pipeline. \u201cThey are large, clinical validity studies that complement the evidence that we are generating,\u201d says Aravanis.</p> <p>They also point out that they are finding a large fraction of those solid tumours that are the most clinically aggressive and therefore have potentially the highest mortality. \u201cEven if you find 10%, that is 10% more than zero,\u201d notes Papadopoulos.</p> <p>Aravanis questions whether finding lots of very early-stage, slow-growing, potentially inconsequential cancers may actually be that helpful. \u201cWhether or not you can detect every single cancer at the earliest stages or pre-cancer is an interesting scientific question, but I don\u2019t know that that is really the important clinical question,\u201d says Aravanis. \u201c[Overdiagnosis] is something that some existing screening programmes struggle with.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the answer, say others such as Rosenfeld and Shaw, is to go for a more limited approach \u2013 tackling high-risk populations or focusing on those cancers where the diagnosis is often late. \u201c[Then] I think we might find places where we can improve the current clinical situation,\u201d says Rosenfeld. And Diamandis doesn\u2019t rule out success in fluids other than blood, such as urine and cervical fluid for bladder and ovarian cancer respectively, where ctDNA concentrations could be far higher because they are in contact with, or proximity to, the tumour.</p> <p>The million-dollar question is, when can we expect a once-a-year blood test that checks for multiple cancers? The typical answer from experts is that it will be at least five years before there is sufficient data to show whether it can work and then it will need to hit the desks of regulators and health economists. Patience, it seems, is a virtue in the fight against cancer. </p> <h2>Breathomics and cancer detection</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f69eb4c8ac52f3fbd7996f4e4d14a789b3417f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f69eb4c8ac52f3fbd7996f4e4d14a789b3417f6/0_70_1085_1085/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cancer breathalyser made by Owlstone Medical.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cancer breathalyser made by Owlstone Medical.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Owlstone medical</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While blood is relatively easy to collect to look for a cancer signal, what about if you could detect it on breath \u2013 no needle required? UK-based company <a href=\"https://www.owlstonemedical.com/\" title=\"\">Owlstone Medical</a> is among those looking to discover whether this is possible. It has developed a breathalyser based on the idea that there may be chemicals \u2013 volatile organic compounds \u2013 in breath indicative of early-stage cancer.</p> <p>It is currently running a trial in partnership with the NHS to see whether there are differences in the chemicals that can be detected in breath between people with lung cancer and those without it. Lung cancer, says Max Allsworth, the company\u2019s chief scientific officer, is a good place to start because the air we breathe directly moves through the lung and past any tumours.</p> <p>The company has also recently started a separate, smaller study looking at whether six other cancer types may also be detected early in this way (in this case, the chemicals would find their way into the breath less directly, via blood, which exchanges volatile chemicals with air in the lungs). Depending on the trial results, it may end up being a more generic cancer detection test \u2013 not telling you specifically where the cancer is, but that a common signal has been found. In all cases, says Allsworth, if there are chemicals in breath that suggest cancer, they will be present very early on, before you are likely to have circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA).</p>",

For that reason, ctDNA is also showing promise as a way to profile and monitor advanced stage cancers, a \u201cliquid biopsy\u201d. Early detection is a harder problem. Early on, when the tumour is small, there is not as much ctDNA to detect. The women Illumina identified as having cancer were all late, not early stage. To date, there is one company offering a blood test based on ctDNA for early cancer detection: Epigenomics began offering its test for colon cancer in 2016 based on detecting biochemical modification of a single gene. But the dream being imagined by Grail and others is an inexpensive test, perhaps no more than $500, which could conceivably be given annually to those over a certain age, with a high chance of detecting many cancers at once with high accuracy (Grail hasn\u2019t announced a final number but thinks it will be in the region of 10). It\u2019s a test that all of us, if it works, could one day get. \u201cThe big studies are still to be done,\u201d says Nitzan Rosenfeld, a researcher who studies ctDNA at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute and a cofounder of the UK-based liquid biopsy company Inivata, \u201cbut there has been considerable progress.\u201d Cancer essentially begins when a normal cell\u2019s DNA gets mutated or altered. From that point, the cell multiplies too often and a mass or tumour of abnormal cells forms. A proportion of the cells invariably die and \u201cshed\u201d genetic material into the bloodstream, mixing with larger amounts of DNA fragments coming from the death of normal cells. It was first reported that fragments of DNA carrying cancer-causing mutations could be found floating freely in the blood of cancer patients in the mid-1990s. The findings caught the attention of Dennis Lo, now a professor of medicine and chemical pathology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who thought that \u201ca baby living in a mother is a little bit like a cancer growing in a patient\u201d. Based on that insight, he went on to discover foetal DNA fragments in maternal blood and to pioneer non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) (he licensed his patents to Illumina and other companies). He also began, along with others, to apply those insights to how ctDNA fragments might be used in the monitoring and detection of cancer. In 2017, Grail merged with Lo\u2019s company, Cirina, also aimed at early detection. Grail\u2019s competitors include Guardant Health, a liquid biopsy company valued at $3.5bn that was founded in 2011 and is also based in Silicon Valley. It recently branched out to work on an early-detection test for four common cancers: lung, breast, colorectal and ovarian. There are also multiple academic efforts with designs on commercialisation. Last year, researchers at Johns Hopkins University school of medicine published details of a potential blood test called CancerSEEK that covers eight cancers. And in December last year, University of Queensland researchers made headlines with a \u201c10-minute test\u201d they have called a methylscape and which they say could potentially give a yes or no answer to the presence of cancer in the body, though it wouldn\u2019t identify its location. Each group or company has or is developing a way of detecting ctDNA. Grail and Guardant\u2019s tests are based on sequencing the cell-free DNA. This can look for mutations, increases in the number of chromosomes or genes or unusual biochemical changes known as epigenetic changes, all of which can occur in the DNA of cancer cells. Grail has been experimenting with all three but hasn\u2019t announced which method its final test will use. Guardant\u2019s method takes them all in. CancerSEEK, meanwhile, looks for a small number of mutations as well as protein markers known to increase in particular cancers. The small mutation panel keeps costs down says Nickolas Papadopoulos, a professor of oncology who is co-leading work on the latter method. Instead of sequencing, methylscapes use gold nanoparticles to detect epigenetic alterations. Results have been published or presented for all these methods, demonstrating that cancer-related signals can be seen. They are based on small studies of 1,000 people or fewer with cancer at various stages. The key for the tests is achieving both a high likelihood of detection (a good sensitivity) and a low false positive rate to avoid needless anxiety and unnecessary follow-up. (In a test being designed for a general population, where cancer actually isn\u2019t very prevalent, the latter is particularly important because even low false positive rates will result in a substantial number of incorrect diagnoses.) Grail\u2019s best detection rates, based on a prototype test for detecting epigenetic changes, ranged from 80% down to 47% for nine cancers (respectively ovarian, liver, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, pancreatic, colorectal, oesophageal, head and neck and lung). Breast cancer ranged from 56% to 11% depending on the type. The false positive rate was set at 2%, though says Aravanis, further work suggests it could hit less than 1%. \u201cFrom a single test, we detected a large fraction of the highest mortality cancers in early stage with very high specificity,\u201d he says. Of Grail\u2019s competitors, CancerSEEK\u2019s sensitivity ranged from 98% for ovarian cancer to 33% for breast cancer with a false positive rate of less than 1%. Guardant showed it could detect lung cancer in 71% of cases and colorectal cancer in 67% of cases with a false positive rate of 2%. Methylscape meanwhile had a sensitivity of 90% but the false positive rate was higher at 10 to 15%. Yet while the companies are bullish about what they are seeing, not everyone is convinced. Eleftherios Diamandis, professor of clinical biochemistry at the University of Toronto, has made a name for himself criticising grand designs for revolutionary blood tests. Well before the media questioned the validity of startup company Theranos\u2019s blood-testing technology \u2013 the firm and its chief executive were charged last year with \u201cmassive fraud\u201d by the US Securities and Exchange Commission \u2013 Diamandis had raised doubts in the scientific literature. Last year, he and his associate Clare Fiala published a series of journal pieces questioning how useful ctDNA could really be in early cancer diagnosis. Diamandis\u2019s calculations, based on experimental literature data, give a sense of the size of tumour a ctDNA-based blood test might be able to pick up. His work indicates that with the technology available for analysing ctDNA, tumours would need to be approximately 1cm in diameter or greater to be detected. \u201cThat is a fairly large tumour,\u201d he says. There is simply unlikely to be a single fragment of DNA from tumours under that size in the 10ml of blood that is a standard sample. While more blood may help a little, it would make things much less pleasant. As Diamandis sees things, the tests do seem to be performing well, but that is because they are being applied to people who have already been diagnosed with cancer. \u201cIf you go to a real population of asymptomatic individuals, their success rate will be, predictably in my opinion, much less,\u201d he says. \u201cFor the [multi-cancer] blood test \u2013 as of today \u2013 I am relatively pessimistic.\u201d For their part, the groups and companies acknowledge that large studies in people without diagnosed cancer are what is needed next. CancerSEEK is looking to enrol 10,000 women without known cancer to take its blood test; it will then follow them over five years to see whether they develop cancer. And Grail has two large, long-running studies of those who are asymptomatic, one of 100,000 and another of 50,000, in the pipeline. \u201cThey are large, clinical validity studies that complement the evidence that we are generating,\u201d says Aravanis. They also point out that they are finding a large fraction of those solid tumours that are the most clinically aggressive and therefore have potentially the highest mortality. \u201cEven if you find 10%, that is 10% more than zero,\u201d notes Papadopoulos. Aravanis questions whether finding lots of very early-stage, slow-growing, potentially inconsequential cancers may actually be that helpful. \u201cWhether or not you can detect every single cancer at the earliest stages or pre-cancer is an interesting scientific question, but I don\u2019t know that that is really the important clinical question,\u201d says Aravanis. \u201c[Overdiagnosis] is something that some existing screening programmes struggle with.\u201d Perhaps the answer, say others such as Rosenfeld and Shaw, is to go for a more limited approach \u2013 tackling high-risk populations or focusing on those cancers where the diagnosis is often late. \u201c[Then] I think we might find places where we can improve the current clinical situation,\u201d says Rosenfeld. And Diamandis doesn\u2019t rule out success in fluids other than blood, such as urine and cervical fluid for bladder and ovarian cancer respectively, where ctDNA concentrations could be far higher because they are in contact with, or proximity to, the tumour. The million-dollar question is, when can we expect a once-a-year blood test that checks for multiple cancers? The typical answer from experts is that it will be at least five years before there is sufficient data to show whether it can work and then it will need to hit the desks of regulators and health economists. Patience, it seems, is a virtue in the fight against cancer. Breathomics and cancer detection While blood is relatively easy to collect to look for a cancer signal, what about if you could detect it on breath \u2013 no needle required? UK-based company Owlstone Medical is among those looking to discover whether this is possible. It has developed a breathalyser based on the idea that there may be chemicals \u2013 volatile organic compounds \u2013 in breath indicative of early-stage cancer. It is currently running a trial in partnership with the NHS to see whether there are differences in the chemicals that can be detected in breath between people with lung cancer and those without it. Lung cancer, says Max Allsworth, the company\u2019s chief scientific officer, is a good place to start because the air we breathe directly moves through the lung and past any tumours. The company has also recently started a separate, smaller study looking at whether six other cancer types may also be detected early in this way (in this case, the chemicals would find their way into the breath less directly, via blood, which exchanges volatile chemicals with air in the lungs). Depending on the trial results, it may end up being a more generic cancer detection test \u2013 not telling you specifically where the cancer is, but that a common signal has been found. In all cases, says Allsworth, if there are chemicals in breath that suggest cancer, they will be present very early on, before you are likely to have circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA).",

Quotes about the value of black people follow from powerful white men including Benjamin Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt. While their open racism isn\u2019t revelatory, it is repugnant and implicitly reminds us that such rank inhumanity must not be forgotten.</p> <p>Morrison takes the question of remembrance further in The Slavebody and the Blackbody (2000), in which she recounts the pressure she was put under to move on from, or sublimate, America\u2019s slave past in the 1980s: \u201cIn some quarters, [it was] understood not only to be progressive but healthy\u2026 The slavebody was dead, wasn\u2019t it? The blackbody was alive, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Her writing on language in relation to race is erudite and nuanced. Black enslavement is branded into language, she argues, in which the \u201ccodes of racial hierarchy and disdain are deeply embedded\u201d. She suggests that these can be circumnavigated with enough awareness and calls herself a \u201craced\u201d writer who knew, from the beginning, that \u201cI could not, would not reproduce the master\u2019s voice and its assumptions of the all-knowing law of the white father.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/13/toni-morrison-home-son-love\">Toni Morrison: 'I want to feel what I feel. Even if it's not happiness'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The dilemmas she grapples with around identity and the pigeonholing of black writers are just as relevant for writers of colour today. In a 2001 essay, she remembers being invited on to a TV show to talk about her work. She asked the interviewer if it was possible to avoid questions around race but he felt that \u201cneither he nor his audience was interested in any aspects of me other than my raced ones\u201d.</p> <p>This double bind \u2013 to be a consciously \u201craced\u201d writer while feeling confined by the expectation to explain or defend race-related issues \u2013 comes up repeatedly: \u201cI had a yearning for an environment in which I could speak and write without every sentence being understood as mere protest or understood as mere advocacy.\u201d</p> <p>Some pieces are less penetrating than others but all have a rigorous logic and intelligence. Interestingly, many of the spoken addresses retain their power on the page and are exhilarating to read for their rousing rhetoric and idealism. The Individual Artist, about the imperative of creating art at any cost, particularly for the black American community, is deeply moving when seen within the legacy of slavery.</p> <p>Elsewhere, in a section that\u2019s distinct in tone from the rest of the material, Morrison explores her own fiction, with close textual analyses of several books (<em>The Bluest Eye</em>, <em>Paradise</em>, <em>Beloved</em>, <em>Tar Baby</em>). She also advocates rereading canonical works, revealing how stories by Gertrude Stein and Mark Twain contain unconscious racial coding.</p> <p>The risk of such wide-ranging subject matter is that it ends up skittering across the surface. Here, however, Morrison\u2019s words possess a contemporary resonance, delivering unwavering truths with an intelligent rage that is almost equal to her hope.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Mouth Full of Blood </em>by Toni Morrison is published by Chatto &amp; Windus (\u00a320).

The blackbody was alive, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Her writing on language in relation to race is erudite and nuanced. Black enslavement is branded into language, she argues, in which the \u201ccodes of racial hierarchy and disdain are deeply embedded\u201d. She suggests that these can be circumnavigated with enough awareness and calls herself a \u201craced\u201d writer who knew, from the beginning, that \u201cI could not, would not reproduce the master\u2019s voice and its assumptions of the all-knowing law of the white father.\u201d The dilemmas she grapples with around identity and the pigeonholing of black writers are just as relevant for writers of colour today. In a 2001 essay, she remembers being invited on to a TV show to talk about her work. She asked the interviewer if it was possible to avoid questions around race but he felt that \u201cneither he nor his audience was interested in any aspects of me other than my raced ones\u201d. This double bind \u2013 to be a consciously \u201craced\u201d writer while feeling confined by the expectation to explain or defend race-related issues \u2013 comes up repeatedly: \u201cI had a yearning for an environment in which I could speak and write without every sentence being understood as mere protest or understood as mere advocacy.\u201d Some pieces are less penetrating than others but all have a rigorous logic and intelligence. Interestingly, many of the spoken addresses retain their power on the page and are exhilarating to read for their rousing rhetoric and idealism. The Individual Artist, about the imperative of creating art at any cost, particularly for the black American community, is deeply moving when seen within the legacy of slavery. Elsewhere, in a section that\u2019s distinct in tone from the rest of the material, Morrison explores her own fiction, with close textual analyses of several books (The Bluest Eye, Paradise, Beloved, Tar Baby). She also advocates rereading canonical works, revealing how stories by Gertrude Stein and Mark Twain contain unconscious racial coding. The risk of such wide-ranging subject matter is that it ends up skittering across the surface. Here, however, Morrison\u2019s words possess a contemporary resonance, delivering unwavering truths with an intelligent rage that is almost equal to her hope. \u2022 Mouth Full of Blood by Toni Morrison is published by Chatto &amp; Windus (\u00a320).

At some point, they will have to decide on one, but not yet. A flat hierarchy has its attractions as does being a group which comes from a diverse range of backgrounds and generations. They do not want to look like any one person\u2019s vanity project. Both the Tory and Labour parties have been in the grip of personality cults and it has not done them any favours. There was the cult of \u201cthe new Maggie\u201d around Theresa May during the now largely forgotten period when she appeared to be popular. This led her to lock the cabinet in a cupboard during the 2017 election and solo front a campaign that was a disaster for her party.

The traction they achieve with the voters and whether more MPs join them will depend greatly on the behaviour of the parties they have departed. Will the Tories and Labour examine what is it about them that so disgusted these MPs that they felt they had no choice but to leave? Or will the ugly sisters decide that the answer is to carry on as they are, only more so?</p> <p>Here, there has been a contrast. The reaction from the Conservatives has been generally regretful rather than vengeful. Mrs May is suddenly spending less time on speed dial to the Brextremists and having some conversations with the moderate wing of her party for fear that more of them will break off. The Corbynite zealots seem unsure whether to celebrate the departure of MPs who were always out of sympathy with the glorious leader or to rage against them. Traitors and Tory stooges have been among the insults hurled at the backs of Labour\u2019s departing MPs. Throwing abusive phrases from the little red book of venom may go down well with the Corbynite core. I am not convinced it will sound attractive to less partisan audiences. This vituperation supplies validation of the defectors\u2019 complaint that Labour has been taken over by intolerant fanatics. Tom Watson, the party\u2019s deputy leader, understands this. He <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73F-S6eyJvs\" title=\"\">spoke of his \u201cdeep sadness\u201d</a>, locating the blame for the split not in the splitters, but in the behaviour of a Labour party that \u201cI no longer recognise\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The first drug-checking service licensed by the Home Office will allow users to have their illicit substances tested without fear of being arrested in a move that could be rolled out nationally if it is shown to save lives. The pilot project, which had a soft launch in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, last Friday but begins in earnest this week, will allow anyone over the age of 18 to take their drugs to the clinic, run by the charity Addaction. Testing the content will take about 10 minutes, during which time the user will complete a short questionnaire to allow harm reduction advice to be tailored to them. \u201cThis is about saving lives,\u201d said Roz Gittins, Addaction\u2019s director of pharmacy. \u201cWe know people take drugs. We don\u2019t have to condone it but nor should we judge people or bury our heads in the sand. It\u2019s our job to do whatever we can to help people make informed choices about the risks they\u2019re taking. Checking the content of drugs is a sensible and progressive way to do that. If people know what\u2019s in something, they can be better informed about the potential harm of taking it.\u201d The launch of the service comes amid rising concerns that users are buying drugs which contain other potentially toxic or more potent substances. Cocaine laced with the synthetic opioid fentanyl has been linked to a number of deaths, while there have also been warnings about the sale of super-strength ecstasy at a number of music festivals. A drug safety charity, the Loop, already conducts drug testing at music festivals and has carried out a similar exercise at a pop-up site in Bristol city centre. But the new project, which has been three years in the planning, is the first to be licensed by the government. \u201cIt\u2019s Home Office-licensed, but in addition to that we have a local agreement in place with the police force,\u201d Gittins said. \u201cSo people will not be stopped and searched on their way in or out of the buildings, because they are supportive of what\u2019s going on.\u201d The pilot is being run in partnership with Hertfordshire University, which is providing the testing equipment and The Loop. \u201cThe work done by the Loop already shows that people who have had substances tested often then decide not to take them, or take less than planned, resulting in less health issues,\u201d added Gittins. Fiona Measham, professor of criminology at Durham University and director of the Loop, said: \u201cThree summers\u2019 piloting festival testing and a year piloting city-centre testing has shown that drug safety testing can identify substances of concern, productively engage with service users and reduce drug-related harm.\u201d All the groups involved in the pilot insisted that they were not in any way condoning the use of illegal drugs.

We\u2019ve had a record of being pretty good in them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ouch. Gatland and Jones famously shared a curry before the tournament started but the days of shared poppadoms may now be over. If it felt strangely appropriate when Tom Curry, of all people, darted over for the only try of the first half, there was only a queasy feeling in English stomachs by the end. In the final analysis Wales\u2019s discipline and aerial game were both superior and England\u2019s much-vaunted bench were also second-best to the home side\u2019s \u201cfinishers\u201d.</p> \n<p>It continued one of sport\u2019s more remarkable sequences: Wales have now beaten England in 1949, 1959, 1969, 1979, 1989, 1999, 2009 and 2019. To Gatland, however, this was anything but a cosmic fluke. \u201cWe said before we left the hotel that we would win today because we\u2019ve forgotten how to lose.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou guys were all talking England up, saying there was going to be 15 points in it. We knew exactly where we were. I said to the players they [England] had no idea what animal was turning up this week but we did. I\u2019ve been involved with a lot of teams and yesterday\u2019s captain\u2019s run was as good as I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p> \n<p>In its own way it was as stunning a coup as the previous English collapses of 2013 and 2015, almost a rerun of Gatland\u2019s very first game as Wales coach on the opening weekend of the 2008 championship. Wales were 19-6 down just before the hour that day and still won 26-19, their first victory at Twickenham for 20 years.</p> \n<p>This time around it would be easy to blame England\u2019s demise on the penalties conceded by Kyle Sinckler but, in truth, they were merely a symptom of the increasing pressure the visitors were coming under. Could Gatland\u2019s men really pull it off? On came Dan Biggar, the perfect man for a tense, nervy, high-wire finale and, sure enough, it was Wales who finished the stronger.</p> \n<p>To concede only three penalties in 80 ferocious minutes spoke volumes for their composure, while Gatland\u2019s decision to start Hill in the Welsh second row also paid handsome dividends. Hill\u2019s reputation is not as lofty as his captain\u2019s but it was the Dragons forward who drove unstoppably through the English cover to put Wales in front. Even before Adams\u2019 leaping salmon impression, the wily Gatland was already the toast of his adopted country.</p>",

Gatland paid tribute to his side\u2019s fitness but also suggested England have a habit of choking on the big occasion. \u201cI look back on England in the last few years and, when it\u2019s really mattered, I\u2019ve questioned whether they can win these really big games. We\u2019ve had a record of being pretty good in them.\u201d Ouch. Gatland and Jones famously shared a curry before the tournament started but the days of shared poppadoms may now be over. If it felt strangely appropriate when Tom Curry, of all people, darted over for the only try of the first half, there was only a queasy feeling in English stomachs by the end. In the final analysis Wales\u2019s discipline and aerial game were both superior and England\u2019s much-vaunted bench were also second-best to the home side\u2019s \u201cfinishers\u201d. It continued one of sport\u2019s more remarkable sequences: Wales have now beaten England in 1949, 1959, 1969, 1979, 1989, 1999, 2009 and 2019. To Gatland, however, this was anything but a cosmic fluke. \u201cWe said before we left the hotel that we would win today because we\u2019ve forgotten how to lose. \u201cYou guys were all talking England up, saying there was going to be 15 points in it. We knew exactly where we were. I said to the players they [England] had no idea what animal was turning up this week but we did. I\u2019ve been involved with a lot of teams and yesterday\u2019s captain\u2019s run was as good as I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d In its own way it was as stunning a coup as the previous English collapses of 2013 and 2015, almost a rerun of Gatland\u2019s very first game as Wales coach on the opening weekend of the 2008 championship. Wales were 19-6 down just before the hour that day and still won 26-19, their first victory at Twickenham for 20 years. This time around it would be easy to blame England\u2019s demise on the penalties conceded by Kyle Sinckler but, in truth, they were merely a symptom of the increasing pressure the visitors were coming under. Could Gatland\u2019s men really pull it off? On came Dan Biggar, the perfect man for a tense, nervy, high-wire finale and, sure enough, it was Wales who finished the stronger. To concede only three penalties in 80 ferocious minutes spoke volumes for their composure, while Gatland\u2019s decision to start Hill in the Welsh second row also paid handsome dividends. Hill\u2019s reputation is not as lofty as his captain\u2019s but it was the Dragons forward who drove unstoppably through the English cover to put Wales in front. Even before Adams\u2019 leaping salmon impression, the wily Gatland was already the toast of his adopted country.",

According to the New York Post\u2019s Page Six column, the exhibit drew the attention of Leonardo DiCaprio, who along with Nicolas Cage and Russell Crowe, has staked out a reputation as a collector. And that\u2019s what alarms palaeontologists who fear not only the loss of scholarship but also the diminution of appreciation for the work that goes into discovery, excavation and reconstruction of a dinosaur skeleton as they become fashionable objects of home decor.

      "body": "<p>On Friday morning a paper sign had been stuck to the granite base of the funeral monument of Karl Marx in Highgate cemetery. The sign, home-printed, read, \u201cYou can destroy Marx\u2019s gravestone, but you cannot destroy his ideology\u201d and was signed by the Turkish Revolutionary Path movement. I was standing in front of the monument with Ian Dungavell, the chief executive of the Friends of Highgate Cemetery Trust. \u201cNormally we take signs down,\u201d he said, \u201cbut on this occasion, I think we\u2019ll leave it.\u201d</p> <p>It had been a long week for Dungavell, an Australian-born expert in Victorian funerary monuments, who took over the running of the private cemetery and its 53,000 graves six years ago. It began with him trying to clean off the blood-red enamel paint that had been used to deface the Marx monument last Saturday, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/17/second-attack-on-karl-marx-tomb-in-londons-highgate-cemetery\" title=\"\">second attack to make headlines</a> across the world in a couple of weeks. The painted slogans made reference to a \u201cdoctrine of hate\u201d. Though saddened and shocked by the vandalism, the aesthete in Dungavell quite admired the attention to detail. \u201cUnusually, whoever did it had got the letter spacing right,\u201d he said. There was no need for regrettable hyphenation in \u201carchitect\u201d or \u201coppression\u201d.</p> <p>The paint itself is not a great concern. Quite a lot was cleaned off before it dried, and there was something calming about scrubbing at it while members of global revolutionary movements assembled in vigil nearby, to sing the Red Flag. Much more of a problem was the second recent hammer attack on the 1881 family headstone that had been incorporated into the 1956 monument. In the first hammer attack, the vandal hadn\u2019t reckoned with the thickness of the marble, but he or she appeared to have returned with a lump hammer. Shattered pieces from the tablet, which bear some of the letters of Marx\u2019s name and those of his five-year-old grandson, Harry Longuet, are in a box on Dungavell\u2019s desk in his office, the former Victorian chapel of rest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72ffa58db029849f68ecb41f251e5a198fd6dd10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72ffa58db029849f68ecb41f251e5a198fd6dd10/0_0_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The family headstone incorporated into the memorial has suffered two hammer attacks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The family headstone incorporated into the memorial has suffered two hammer attacks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the coming days, there will be a meeting of the executive committee of the cemetery to decide how to restore the marble, and to discuss whether extra security measures will be required.

I\u2019m not sure they would welcome any cameras.\u201d</p> <p>Traditionally, he said, the cemetery\u2019s best security had been the fact that it was a \u201cliving place\u201d. It has 90,000 tourist visitors a year, who discover not only the resting place of Marx but also those of Douglas Adams and George Eliot and innumerable eminent Victorians. I live near the cemetery and often, in deadline despair or when gloom has settled, wander down past the Marx monument and the pilgrims taking clenched-fist selfies, through its gothically overgrown avenues, to read some of the inscriptions and find a bit of perspective. Not everyone shares that enthusiasm. I once made the case for the value of a \u00a320 annual pass to the cemetery to a neighbour. \u201cI\u2019ll have a season ticket for there soon enough,\u201d he replied.</p> <p>Aside from the daily influx of visitors, the other best defence that the Marx monument has is its design. The sculptor and lifelong socialist Laurence Bradshaw took account of the likelihood of his statue being vandalised and employed \u201csome of the techniques available to the military engineer\u201d. He placed the brooding bronze bust high up on a plinth, using Cornish granite facing over a brick core. The design proved its worth when it survived a pipe bomb attack in 1970 (a subsequent threat by the National Front to restorers \u2013 \u201cwhen you\u2019ve repaired the statue of that commie bastard we\u2019ll blow it up again\u201d \u2013 proved hollow).</p> <p>The Marx monument created controversy even before it was erected. The cemetery\u2019s management demanded a payment of \u00a32,000 from the Communist Party of Great Britain, which had already raised the funds to have it made, on the grounds that it was six inches too tall. There is an evocative film of the unveiling of the statue in March 1956. It represented something of a high-water mark for British communism, before the schism caused by Soviet tanks rolling into Budapest eight months later. JD Bernal, pioneer of X-rays and revolutionary socialist, gave the address. Bernal was a mentor of the young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/01/eric-hobsbawm\" title=\"\">Eric Hobsbawm</a> at Birkbeck College.

      "body": "<p>A meme is circulating on social media in response to people enjoying the weather, pointing out that rather than the assumed four seasons, there are actually 11, of which we are entering the second: Winter, Fool\u2019s spring, Second winter, Spring of deception, Third winter, Mud season, Actual spring, Summer, False autumn, Second summer and Actual autumn. In the less brutal of these, I get off the train a few stops early on my way to work and walk along the canal listening to a podcast. It has become clear that this is the only way I can concentrate \u2013 when it\u2019s just me, a goose and the good morning smell of marijuana. But it\u2019s also made me realise that when I\u2019m listening to something on headphones, I\u2019m not entirely here.</p> <p>There are infinite reviews of books, music and podcasts, but rarely will someone review the experience of listening. A modern review might acknowledge, for example, that listening to this in motion during an autumnal shower you will feel like Buster Keaton as the front of a house falls down on him. The combination of emotions and dialect will propel the listener to work in a cloud of brick dust, leaving them standing shakily with a window frame around their feet wondering how they got there. Why do we not talk about this more? The dizzying effect of a stranger whispering into your ear?</p> <p>This week I\u2019ve been listening to an audiobook, and the experience has grizzled and slapped me about. Reading a novel, one\u2019s eyes remain focused on the black and white page, but listening to one allows a level of disassociated roaming, the effect of which for me has been a merging of truths. I will reach the steps by the bridge and be quickly struck with the memory of having broken up with my boyfriend at the top, before consciously recalibrating to pin this down in fact as simply the place I was yesterday when the characters broke up in my book. I have new memories of love blossoming at traffic lights, and abuse centred around the biscuit aisle of my local Sainsbury\u2019s. It sounds like nothing, maybe, but for me it\u2019s adding a disconcerting element of virtual reality to my morning commute. There is a danger to it.</p> <p>Of all the clues that I\u2019m getting old, the sight of young people permanently plugged into their headphones is the most confusing. Everywhere, the chattering of mouths into phones that aren\u2019t there, the animated discussion happening between a single person. Headphones the size of croissants, or wireless buds surely begging to fall into a busy road, all ears full, at all times, everywhere. These people appear to be living normal lives, buying fruit, reading messages, savouring the brief joys of a meal-deal\u2019s dessert. And yet, all the time there is somebody singing or talking into their ears. All the time!</p> <p>Me, no. Me, when I am listening to a podcast, I am sitting there on the producer\u2019s lap. I am sitting there on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonronson\" title=\"\">Jon Ronson</a>\u2019s knee as he gently asks a man about his wife\u2019s death. I am propped up in bed with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jul/02/listen-to-this-savage-lovecast-dan-savage\" title=\"\">Dan Savage</a>\u2019s caller as she considers how to ask her boyfriend to treat her more like a baby. I am thinking bitter chauvinistic thoughts as I sit between a pair of women giggling about murder. In my <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/11/the-week-in-radio-podcasts-this-american-life-five-women-the-inquiry-how-did-we-get-hooked-on-plasti\" title=\"\">This American Life</a></em> phase I thought of my headphones as a tool for crying with, as inevitably I would arrive at my destination striped with mascara and need to do some breathing exercises quickly by the sinks. Is it like this for everyone? When I see somebody on the bus singing heartily along to their playlist I think it might be, but other times I worry it points to a simpleness in my brain. I drown in these things.</p> <p>Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m so used to doing three things at a time, damping down the constant ache to click away, that the experience of listening properly is so overwhelming. Maybe it\u2019s the relaxing meditation of a voice almost whispering, or the pace of a podcast, uncommon to a digital age. Maybe it\u2019s that these stories mean I can never be alone, or maybe it\u2019s the uncommon intimacy of having a story read to me. I read a lot of stories out loud, including one last week to a class of children, with a boy who, at the end, asked, \u201cWill the postman be OK?\u201d The story had not featured a postman; I said \u201cyes\u201d with feeling.</p> <p>Every evening a bedtime story will provide some rhyming resolution to the day just gone, and then the lights are turned off, and then goodnight. I am returning the favour to myself, with a brisk Irish accent telling me what the trees looked like that warm day in September, a dry American writer crowbarring open my ideas of what a relationship is for, an Australian investigator who will not let it lie. This is the season to succumb to a stranger\u2019s voice, for taking your book outside and letting it walk us somewhere new.</p> <p><em>Email Eva at <a href=\"mailto:e.wiseman@observer.co.uk\">e.wiseman@observer.co.uk</a> or follow her on Twitter <a href=\"http:\">@EvaWiseman</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "A meme is circulating on social media in response to people enjoying the weather, pointing out that rather than the assumed four seasons, there are actually 11, of which we are entering the second: Winter, Fool\u2019s spring, Second winter, Spring of deception, Third winter, Mud season, Actual spring, Summer, False autumn, Second summer and Actual autumn. In the less brutal of these, I get off the train a few stops early on my way to work and walk along the canal listening to a podcast. It has become clear that this is the only way I can concentrate \u2013 when it\u2019s just me, a goose and the good morning smell of marijuana. But it\u2019s also made me realise that when I\u2019m listening to something on headphones, I\u2019m not entirely here. There are infinite reviews of books, music and podcasts, but rarely will someone review the experience of listening. A modern review might acknowledge, for example, that listening to this in motion during an autumnal shower you will feel like Buster Keaton as the front of a house falls down on him. The combination of emotions and dialect will propel the listener to work in a cloud of brick dust, leaving them standing shakily with a window frame around their feet wondering how they got there. Why do we not talk about this more? The dizzying effect of a stranger whispering into your ear? This week I\u2019ve been listening to an audiobook, and the experience has grizzled and slapped me about. Reading a novel, one\u2019s eyes remain focused on the black and white page, but listening to one allows a level of disassociated roaming, the effect of which for me has been a merging of truths. I will reach the steps by the bridge and be quickly struck with the memory of having broken up with my boyfriend at the top, before consciously recalibrating to pin this down in fact as simply the place I was yesterday when the characters broke up in my book. I have new memories of love blossoming at traffic lights, and abuse centred around the biscuit aisle of my local Sainsbury\u2019s. It sounds like nothing, maybe, but for me it\u2019s adding a disconcerting element of virtual reality to my morning commute. There is a danger to it. Of all the clues that I\u2019m getting old, the sight of young people permanently plugged into their headphones is the most confusing. Everywhere, the chattering of mouths into phones that aren\u2019t there, the animated discussion happening between a single person. Headphones the size of croissants, or wireless buds surely begging to fall into a busy road, all ears full, at all times, everywhere. These people appear to be living normal lives, buying fruit, reading messages, savouring the brief joys of a meal-deal\u2019s dessert. And yet, all the time there is somebody singing or talking into their ears. All the time! Me, no. Me, when I am listening to a podcast, I am sitting there on the producer\u2019s lap. I am sitting there on Jon Ronson\u2019s knee as he gently asks a man about his wife\u2019s death. I am propped up in bed with Dan Savage\u2019s caller as she considers how to ask her boyfriend to treat her more like a baby. I am thinking bitter chauvinistic thoughts as I sit between a pair of women giggling about murder. In my This American Life phase I thought of my headphones as a tool for crying with, as inevitably I would arrive at my destination striped with mascara and need to do some breathing exercises quickly by the sinks. Is it like this for everyone? When I see somebody on the bus singing heartily along to their playlist I think it might be, but other times I worry it points to a simpleness in my brain. I drown in these things. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m so used to doing three things at a time, damping down the constant ache to click away, that the experience of listening properly is so overwhelming. Maybe it\u2019s the relaxing meditation of a voice almost whispering, or the pace of a podcast, uncommon to a digital age. Maybe it\u2019s that these stories mean I can never be alone, or maybe it\u2019s the uncommon intimacy of having a story read to me. I read a lot of stories out loud, including one last week to a class of children, with a boy who, at the end, asked, \u201cWill the postman be OK?\u201d The story had not featured a postman; I said \u201cyes\u201d with feeling. Every evening a bedtime story will provide some rhyming resolution to the day just gone, and then the lights are turned off, and then goodnight. I am returning the favour to myself, with a brisk Irish accent telling me what the trees looked like that warm day in September, a dry American writer crowbarring open my ideas of what a relationship is for, an Australian investigator who will not let it lie. This is the season to succumb to a stranger\u2019s voice, for taking your book outside and letting it walk us somewhere new.

A tip of the hat to the women\u2019s ODI team, with star turns from Jess Jonassen and Ellyse Perry deserving of special praise. A couple of excellent AFLW games, a not-so excellent A-League game - and, of course, the elephant in the room. Or rather, the elephant on the rugby field that trampled all over the Rebels during their 112-0 hammering. It\u2019s still early days for the Super W of course, but wince-inducing results like that aren\u2019t exactly a good look. Let\u2019s hope they can sort the competition balance out soon. Anyhoo, that\u2019s a whole different debate.

However Elrich gave a long-suffering crowd of 7,181 reason to cheer when he struck home from long-range in the 94th minute on Sunday.</p> <p>There was little energy from the home side and their fans from the start. A lack of atmosphere, which included another boycott of the club\u2019s active supporter group, matched a lifeless first half showing. Their ineptitude could have been a result of coach Markus Babbel being forced into fielding a makeshift back three due to injuries and suspension. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9815ddfd43a5e02e2e041aa96fedc11ebcc4fb69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9815ddfd43a5e02e2e041aa96fedc11ebcc4fb69/0_49_3434_2061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tarek Elrich curls home a late equaliser for the Wanderers at Spotless Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tarek Elrich curls home a late equaliser for the Wanderers at Spotless Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Kolbe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their plight was made worse when youngster Jordan O\u2019Doherty was stretchered from the field due to a suspected ACL injury in the 14th minute. That pain doubled not long after when Diego Castro found an unmarked Ikonomidis, who helped on a low cross under Vedran Janjetovic for the opener. It was the former Wanderers striker\u2019s eighth goal of the season. It took the Wanderers until the third minute of injury time to finally test Glory gloveman Liam Reddy, however Oriol Riera\u2019s header was palmed away.</p> <p>The home side picked up their running in the second half and, coupled with Perth\u2019s inability to put the game away, slowly grew into the match. The Glory only had two looks at goal compared to Western Sydney\u2019s eight in the second half, the last of which came from outside of the box by Elrich.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Newcastle missed the chance to move one win outside the A-League top six with a scoreless draw against Adelaide United at McDonald Jones Stadium. With sixth-placed Wellington losing on Saturday to Sydney 1-0, seventh-placed Newcastle had the chance to close the gap to three points with seven rounds remaining but they offered little in attack on Sunday after a hectic schedule of games.</p> <p>Playing their fourth match in 12 days, the Jets were backing up from Tuesday night\u2019s 4-1 loss to Kashima Antlers which ended their Asian Champions League run in Japan. Without key attacking weapon Ronny Vargas (hamstring), Newcastle looked flat against the fourth-placed Reds, who went closest to scoring when Craig Goodwin managed to get in behind the Jets\u2019 defence in the 42nd minute but powered his shot into the crossbar.</p> <p>The Jets forced a save from Paul Izzo in the 67th minute when substitute Joey Champness\u2019 miscued volley almost lobbed in under the bar. Neither side, though, put the opposing goalkeeper under regular pressure in a game of mainly half chances.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-24T10:39:01.082Z\">at 10.39am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c724d67e4b00307e95a95c1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-24T07:58:51.959Z\">7.58am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">A-League: FT - Newcastle 0-0 Adelaide</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And the Newcastle forwards are put out of their misery.

North trailed during the final term before King was paid a questionable push-in-the-back free kick and kicked truly from 20m out to wrestle back the lead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8baaa1e38c15550c55b905053233291bcf111dde\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8baaa1e38c15550c55b905053233291bcf111dde/0_84_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ashleigh Guest runs with the ball at Casey Fields.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashleigh Guest runs with the ball at Casey Fields.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Pockett/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speedy forward Aliesha Newman starred for the Demons with two majors while Karen Paxman gathered 25 touches in a compelling duel with Kearney. The defeat leaves Melbourne in a battle to make the finals given only two teams progress from each conference. The Dees sit in fourth place in Conference A, trailing second-placed Adelaide and third-placed Fremantle by four points with three home-and-away rounds remaining.</p> <p>In the earlier game, GWS were victors for the first time this season after holding off winless Collingwood by nine points in blustery conditions at Morwell.</p> <p>The Giants broke the game open with four first-quarter goals and the hot-start allowed them to run out winners 5.6 (36) to 4.3 (27). Alan McConnell\u2019s team capitalised on the strong wind which saw just one point kicked against the breeze for the entire game. Kicking with the wind in the last quarter, the Magpies made a late charge by kicking two majors while keeping their Conference B rivals scoreless but the early deficit proved too much.</p> <p>Ace Giants midfielder Alicia Eva (22 possessions) played a major role in defeating her old side, while Rebecca Beeson and Courtney Gum were also outstanding. Tait Mackrill got the Giants off to a flyer after snapping a goal in the first minute before Louise Stephenson made it two shortly after with a brilliant left-foot effort from the pocket.</p> <p>Irish recruit Cora Staunton, Yvonne Bonner and Jess Dal Pos were GWS\u2019 other goal-kickers. \u201cThey were hard conditions out there and both teams had a fair bit riding on it so it was good for the girls to get a result,\u201d Giants coach McConnell said. \u201cIt required a little bit of a different approach to ball use; you needed to be a bit slower going up in the wind and go fast the other way and occasionally we got it wrong.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c724a2be4b00307e95a95b1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-24T07:42:45.037Z\">7.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A-League: 80 mins - Newcastle 0-0 Adelaide</strong></p> <p>When I said it had been pretty average tonight, I may have been sugarcoating it.

Women\u2019s sport takes centre stage today with Super W, the women\u2019s ODI and AFLW action. There\u2019s also a smattering of A-League fun in the evening.</p> <p>Over in Adelaide, the women\u2019s<strong> ODI </strong>between<strong> Australia </strong>and<strong> New Zealand</strong> is already well under way. The Kiwis have just started their reply. I\u2019ll jump into that shortly, but the current main picture for this blog should give you a clue as to who the star was in Australia\u2019s innings.</p> <p>Also in full swing is the <strong>AFLW</strong> clash between winless Conference B clubs <strong>Collingwood</strong> <strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>the<strong> Giants</strong>, which despite their struggles this season is still intriguing because a quirk of the system means both teams can still qualify for the finals. Or as the headline in today\u2019s Age put it: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/everything-to-play-for-in-pointless-encounter-20190220-p50z42.html\">Everything to play for in pointless encounter</a>\u201d. Nice. In about an hour we switch focus to the much stronger Conference A, where <strong>Melbourne </strong>take on front-runners<strong> North Melbourne, </strong>who are the only unbeaten side still in the comp after Fremantle\u2019s loss last night.</p> <p>Just starting in the <strong>Super W</strong>, the <strong>Rebels</strong> are taking on <strong>Queensland</strong>. I\u2019ll keep you posted on that too, but it looks like the Waratahs are very much still the team to beat after <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/rugby-union/super-w-nsw-waratahs-beat-brumbies-in-season-opener-20190223-p50zss.html\">yesterday\u2019s shellacking</a> of the Brumbies.</p> <p>Then it\u2019s off to the Hunter for the <strong>A-League</strong> clash between the <strong>Jets</strong> and <strong>Adelaide. </strong>The Reds will be desperate to bounce back after that shock loss to the Wanderers last week, while Newcastle are stuck in the A-League limbo of seventh place \u2013 six points behind sixth, and six points ahead of eighth. Following that it\u2019s the <strong>Wanderers</strong> hosting <strong>Perth</strong>, although I\u2019ll have said sayonara to the blog by then\u2026 but I might tag on a match report because, what can I say, I live to give.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-24T11:12:15.558Z\">at 11.12am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

A couple of excellent AFLW games, a not-so excellent A-League game - and, of course, the elephant in the room. Or rather, the elephant on the rugby field that trampled all over the Rebels during their 112-0 hammering. It\u2019s still early days for the Super W of course, but wince-inducing results like that aren\u2019t exactly a good look. Let\u2019s hope they can sort the competition balance out soon. Anyhoo, that\u2019s a whole different debate. Thanks for joining me, catch you next time. A-League round-up AAP: A last-gasp goal from Tarek Elrich gave Western Sydney a share of the points against A-League leaders Perth in their final game at Spotless Stadium. It appeared Chris Ikonomidis\u2019 first-half goal would be enough to ensure Tony Popovic\u2019s return to Wanderland was a triumphant one. However Elrich gave a long-suffering crowd of 7,181 reason to cheer when he struck home from long-range in the 94th minute on Sunday. There was little energy from the home side and their fans from the start. A lack of atmosphere, which included another boycott of the club\u2019s active supporter group, matched a lifeless first half showing. Their ineptitude could have been a result of coach Markus Babbel being forced into fielding a makeshift back three due to injuries and suspension. Their plight was made worse when youngster Jordan O\u2019Doherty was stretchered from the field due to a suspected ACL injury in the 14th minute. That pain doubled not long after when Diego Castro found an unmarked Ikonomidis, who helped on a low cross under Vedran Janjetovic for the opener. It was the former Wanderers striker\u2019s eighth goal of the season. It took the Wanderers until the third minute of injury time to finally test Glory gloveman Liam Reddy, however Oriol Riera\u2019s header was palmed away. The home side picked up their running in the second half and, coupled with Perth\u2019s inability to put the game away, slowly grew into the match. The Glory only had two looks at goal compared to Western Sydney\u2019s eight in the second half, the last of which came from outside of the box by Elrich. Meanwhile, Newcastle missed the chance to move one win outside the A-League top six with a scoreless draw against Adelaide United at McDonald Jones Stadium. With sixth-placed Wellington losing on Saturday to Sydney 1-0, seventh-placed Newcastle had the chance to close the gap to three points with seven rounds remaining but they offered little in attack on Sunday after a hectic schedule of games. Playing their fourth match in 12 days, the Jets were backing up from Tuesday night\u2019s 4-1 loss to Kashima Antlers which ended their Asian Champions League run in Japan. Without key attacking weapon Ronny Vargas (hamstring), Newcastle looked flat against the fourth-placed Reds, who went closest to scoring when Craig Goodwin managed to get in behind the Jets\u2019 defence in the 42nd minute but powered his shot into the crossbar. The Jets forced a save from Paul Izzo in the 67th minute when substitute Joey Champness\u2019 miscued volley almost lobbed in under the bar. Neither side, though, put the opposing goalkeeper under regular pressure in a game of mainly half chances. And the Newcastle forwards are put out of their misery. Job done for Adelaide, who never really went for it. But then they didn\u2019t need to. Unlike Newcastle, who only seemed to (attempt to) turn up the heat in the final 10 minutes. It\u2019s easy to forget they created a few sights of goal, because their finishing was so poor it felt like they were barely half-chances. A messy affair with the right result. A-League: 90 mins - Newcastle 0-0 Adelaide No one howls quite like Thomassen when someone attempts to slide tackle him. That\u2019s a first-class, Halloween-style scream on the flank - and he gets nothing for it. Except maybe a nomination at the Oscars. A-League: 88 mins - Newcastle 0-0 Adelaide A group of Jets fans are bouncing around with their shoes in their hand. Madness I tell you. Newcastle just can\u2019t find a way through. Oooo! Superb cross from Jackson, perfect for the onrushing O\u2019Donovan - middle of the goal, free header, close range - and he completely misses it. Oh dear. AFLW round-up AAP: North Melbourne remain unbeaten in the AFLW after downing Melbourne by four points in a tense encounter at Casey Fields. Ruck-forward Emma King booted three goals, including a critical fourth-quarter effort that ensured the Kangaroos ran out 6.2 (38) to 5.4 (34) winners to sit four points clear on top of Conference A. The 186cm King proved to be the X-factor for the Roos, who were brilliantly led by midfielders Jamie Stanton (21 disposals) and Emma Kearney (15 disposals). North trailed during the final term before King was paid a questionable push-in-the-back free kick and kicked truly from 20m out to wrestle back the lead. Speedy forward Aliesha Newman starred for the Demons with two majors while Karen Paxman gathered 25 touches in a compelling duel with Kearney. The defeat leaves Melbourne in a battle to make the finals given only two teams progress from each conference. The Dees sit in fourth place in Conference A, trailing second-placed Adelaide and third-placed Fremantle by four points with three home-and-away rounds remaining. In the earlier game, GWS were victors for the first time this season after holding off winless Collingwood by nine points in blustery conditions at Morwell. The Giants broke the game open with four first-quarter goals and the hot-start allowed them to run out winners 5.6 (36) to 4.3 (27). Alan McConnell\u2019s team capitalised on the strong wind which saw just one point kicked against the breeze for the entire game. Kicking with the wind in the last quarter, the Magpies made a late charge by kicking two majors while keeping their Conference B rivals scoreless but the early deficit proved too much. Ace Giants midfielder Alicia Eva (22 possessions) played a major role in defeating her old side, while Rebecca Beeson and Courtney Gum were also outstanding. Tait Mackrill got the Giants off to a flyer after snapping a goal in the first minute before Louise Stephenson made it two shortly after with a brilliant left-foot effort from the pocket. Irish recruit Cora Staunton, Yvonne Bonner and Jess Dal Pos were GWS\u2019 other goal-kickers. \u201cThey were hard conditions out there and both teams had a fair bit riding on it so it was good for the girls to get a result,\u201d Giants coach McConnell said. \u201cIt required a little bit of a different approach to ball use; you needed to be a bit slower going up in the wind and go fast the other way and occasionally we got it wrong.\u201d A-League: 80 mins - Newcastle 0-0 Adelaide When I said it had been pretty average tonight, I may have been sugarcoating it. I certainly won\u2019t miss the words \u201cback to Moss\u201d when this is over. At least Boland is trying something different. From just over the half-way line, he launches a long-distance chip, but Moss isn\u2019t THAT far off his line and gathers it comfortably. On target at least. A-League: 72 mins - Newcastle 0-0 Adelaide It\u2019s been pretty average tonight, especially in terms of finishing and creating chances. Very little on target. It reflects worse on Newcastle than Adelaide, who have probably played the better football and aren\u2019t as desperate for all three points. Jair hits one straight down the keeper\u2019s throat with little power. Sums up Newcastle\u2019s night in front of goal. There\u2019s still time though. Here\u2019s the women\u2019s ODI report from our own Jonathan Howcroft. A-League: 62 mins - Newcastle 0-0 Adelaide Oooo, Thomassen flies to the floor in the area, yelling his head off for a penalty. Nothing doing. VAR agrees. And the slow-motion replay confirms he wasn\u2019t even close to being touched. A reminder that referees have tough jobs because in real time I did a sharp intake of breath and was surprised when I didn\u2019t hear the whistle. Should\u2019ve gone to Specsavers. A-League: 52 mins - Newcastle 0-0 Adelaide Hmm, I\u2019m still not sensing the urgency I was hoping for at half-time. In fact it seems a bit same-same from both teams. Petratos finds himself in some space from about 25 yards out, but drags his shot wide. Adelaide still getting in some good positions but letting themselves down with the final ball. A-League: HT - Newcastle 0-0 Adelaide All square at the break. About right I reckon - neither side has done enough to earn the lead. Adelaide have seen plenty of the ball in the Jets half, particularly in the opening 30mins but it was the Jets who arguably had the best chance, O\u2019Donovan so close to getting a toe on a dangerous cross into the box. Hopefully someone takes the game by the scruff of the neck after the break. Tense stuff. The Demons look devastated at the siren as North Melbourne juuuust hold on to their unbeaten record. Excellent clash between two good sides, but North still the team to beat. They\u2019ve bought themselves some breathing space in the conference. Tough on the Demons who are looking down the barrel. AFLW: 4Q (1min left) Melbourne 5.4 (34), North 6.2 (38) I thought the A-League would be taking all my attention at this time of the evening but this is turning into a cracker. Little in it as we enter the final minute and both teams scrapping as if their lives depended on it. Hearts in mouths every time someone takes a shot - every kick counts at this stage. A-League: 32 mins - Newcastle 0-0 Adelaide Seven corners for Adelaide. You\u2019d think they\u2019d have had more clear chances with that sort of statistic but, meh. They\u2019ve had plenty of possession in good places but Newcastle have stood up. In fact, they almost score on the counter - a great ball in the Adelaide box somehow eludes everyone - O\u2019Donovan just inches from making a connection to steer it goalwards. That\u2019s about as close as anyone\u2019s got so far. Hard to see where a goal will come from at the minute. Needs someone to liven things up. Where\u2019s Pochettino when you need him? AFLW: 3Q - Melbourne 4.4 (28), North Melbourne 5.1 (31) Just about to start the final quarter and all the momentum is with Melbourne but North are leading where it counts. Just three points in it. This is possibly the hardest North have been tested so far this campaign - but can the Demons get over the line? Excitement she wrote. A-League: 20 mins - Newcastle 0-0 Adelaide We\u2019re under way in the Hunter and it\u2019s all a bit cat and mouse at the minute, most of the game being played in midfield. Newcastle pressing all over the pitch but the Reds don\u2019t look particularly flustered, nor do they look especially composed either. The Jets fluff a set-piece right on the edge of the box that they\u2019ve clearly been working on, Jair with a little dummy beforehand. Bet it looked great in training. Not so good when it bounces harmlessly off the wall. That\u2019s all she wrote. Perry (107 no) set it up and Jonassen (27-5) finished it off, choking the life out of the New Zealand batsmen. It\u2019s Schutt who gets the final wicket though, a fairly simple catch for Haynes to dismiss Jensen (21), who had dug in despite wickets tumbling around her. New Zealand all out for 152 after 37.5 overs. Australia take an unassailable 2-0 lead. AFLW: HT - Melbourne 2.3 (15) - North Melbourne 4.1 (25) Still pretty tight at Casey Fields but North in the ascendency after that second quarter. They\u2019re shaping up as the team to beat as we edge closer to the business end of the comp. Women\u2019s ODI: New Zealand 144-9 (36 overs) chasing 248 It\u2019s escalated quickly in Adelaide. The last 30 mins have turned the game from tightly poised to almost over - Australia running through the Kiwi middle order and tail end to close in on victory. Jonassen has done the damage, in fact she was on a hat-trick after taking out Kerr and Tahuhu in the previous over. Just a matter of time now. She\u2019s got figures of 24-5. It\u2019s all over. Although I could have said that at half-time. Seventeen tries no less. The Rebels utterly outclassed, with Queensland only taking their foot off the gas for the final couple of minutes. Ominous stuff from Queensland. Super W: 77 mins - Rebels 0-112 Queensland For once, that\u2019s not a typo on this blog. It really is 112 - not 11 or 12. It\u2019s a century for Queensland. And still a few minutes to go. Speaking of the Matildas, here\u2019s a great piece from midweek by Richard Parkin about the arrival of Ante Milicic. At least that\u2019s the end of the Stajcic saga, right guys? *coughs nervously* The A-League approacheth, and so the obligatory David Squires plug must be wheeled out. All hail Squiresy, for making the rest of us Guardianistas look like amateurs. Hilarious as usual. Here are the highlights from the Waratahs\u2019 26-0 win over the Brumbies in their Super W opener yesterday. I say highlights but in truth it was a scrappy one, bit of rustiness from both teams I suspect - although they will be shuffling uncomfortably if they\u2019re watching Queensland. No cobwebs there. AFLW: Q1 - Melbourne 1.0 (6), North Melbourne 1.1 (7) Anyway, let\u2019s turn our attention to something a little less disturbing. It\u2019s the end of the first quarter in today\u2019s other AFLW clash and there\u2019s just one point in it. That\u2019s more like it. Plenty of pressure around the ball and neither side dominant. The unbeaten Norths have the slightest of edges. Tough one to call at this stage. Super W: 57 mins - Rebels 0-79 Queensland Remember when I said it was looking ugly for the Rebels? Well it\u2019s gone full Cohaagen at the end of Total Recall. They cooked up a story and threw the Rebels into a meat grinder. (Apologies for mixing my Arnie* film references.) *Not Graham Arnold, the other one Cricket: ODI - New Zealand 98-3 (22 overs) chasing 248 Another one bites the dust in New Zealand\u2019s reply. It\u2019s a big one too. Sophie Devine falls for 47 lbw to Jonassen - just when it looked like the visitors were starting to take control. Nothing between the teams at this stage. Fair play to the Pies who huffed and puffed but the huge gap at the end of the third quarter proved too much in the end. The Giants kept scoreless for the final quarter but they did enough to get over the line against the breeze. Super W: HT - Rebels 0-53 Queensland Yeesh. It\u2019s looking very, very ugly for the Rebels, who looked like a broken team for that last 10 minutes. Queensland running riot. They clearly mean business this season after falling agonisingly short in last year\u2019s grand final thriller. There were hopes that this year\u2019s comp would be a little more balanced but after the Tahs result, and the way this one is shaping up, it doesn\u2019t bode well for the Super W\u2019s lesser lights. Still very much a fledgling comp though. It looks like Cameron Bancroft has put the sandpaper scandal behind him (or he\u2019s at least doing a better job of hiding it than he did the actual sandpaper). He\u2019s belted an unbeaten century for WA against NSW after ending his ban. Here\u2019s the AAP report: Western Australia opener Cameron Bancroft has carried his bat for an unbeaten century against NSW in his Sheffield Shield return after a nine-month ban. Bancroft scored 138 in a marathon 358-ball innings to almost single-handedly keep WA\u2019s innings together at Bankstown Oval, as the visitors were dismissed for 279 just before lunch on day two. After batting through two elongated sessions on a rain-affected day one, Bancroft moved from his overnight 73 to bring up his 12th first-class century off 276 balls. WA resumed at 5-183 on Sunday with debutant Brad Hope (eight) dismissed in the first over. Wickets continued to fall at regular intervals before Bancroft picked up the scoring rate with the fall of the ninth wicket, hitting sixes off successive Steve O\u2019Keefe deliveries. Bancroft and Sam Whiteman (66) put on an opening stand of 119 on Saturday but only No.10 Liam Guthrie was able to join them in double figures. It is the third time Bancroft has carried his bat at first-class level. Bancroft returned to Twenty20 cricket in late December after his highly-publicised suspension ban for ball tampering during Australia\u2019s Test against South Africa in Cape Town last March. Paceman Trent Copeland (4-81) and spinner O\u2019Keefe (4-78) shared the wickets for NSW on day two. AFLW: 3Q - Collingwood 2.1 (13) GWS Giants 5.6 (36) It\u2019s three-quarter-time between the Pies and GWS, with the Giants in control. Collingwood have the breeze for the final quarter but it will take a big effort to turn things around and save the season. Women\u2019s ODI: New Zealand chasing 248 for victory Over to the Karen Rolton Oval in Adelaide where the Australian innings wrapped up on 247-7, led by an unbeaten 107 off 110 balls from Ellyse Perry. Awesome stuff from the all-rounder, who has also just bowled a maiden and made an early breakthrough with the wicket of Bates. The tourists are currently 33-2 in reply, with Down just gone lbw. Harsh. Looked like it was missing. Afternoon everyone, and for all you Liberal Party fans out there (the Guardian\u2019s key demographic) who are desperately searching for inspiring women to potentially stand at the upcoming election, look no further. Women\u2019s sport takes centre stage today with Super W, the women\u2019s ODI and AFLW action. There\u2019s also a smattering of A-League fun in the evening. Over in Adelaide, the women\u2019s ODI between Australia and New Zealand is already well under way. The Kiwis have just started their reply. I\u2019ll jump into that shortly, but the current main picture for this blog should give you a clue as to who the star was in Australia\u2019s innings. Also in full swing is the AFLW clash between winless Conference B clubs Collingwood and the Giants, which despite their struggles this season is still intriguing because a quirk of the system means both teams can still qualify for the finals. Or as the headline in today\u2019s Age put it: \u201cEverything to play for in pointless encounter\u201d. Nice. In about an hour we switch focus to the much stronger Conference A, where Melbourne take on front-runners North Melbourne, who are the only unbeaten side still in the comp after Fremantle\u2019s loss last night. Just starting in the Super W, the Rebels are taking on Queensland. I\u2019ll keep you posted on that too, but it looks like the Waratahs are very much still the team to beat after yesterday\u2019s shellacking of the Brumbies. Then it\u2019s off to the Hunter for the A-League clash between the Jets and Adelaide. The Reds will be desperate to bounce back after that shock loss to the Wanderers last week, while Newcastle are stuck in the A-League limbo of seventh place \u2013 six points behind sixth, and six points ahead of eighth. Following that it\u2019s the Wanderers hosting Perth, although I\u2019ll have said sayonara to the blog by then\u2026 but I might tag on a match report because, what can I say, I live to give.",

      "body": "<p>The man in the picture is on fire with love. Flames surge and ripple around him. Dressed in nothing but a fine lawn undershirt, open almost to the waist, hair slicked back from his beautiful face in the heat, he is all ready for the beloved. A woman whose identity is revealed \u2013 if only we could make it out \u2013 in the miniature dangling from a chain round his neck, a portrait even smaller than this one. She gave herself to him, in private, and now he offers himself in return: a lover burning with passion.</p> <p>Nicholas Hilliard\u2019s <em>Unknown Young Man Against a Background of Flames</em> is a stupendous painting \u2013 overwhelmingly potent and erotic. Yet it is not quite three inches tall. An object made to be held in the hand, to be touched, examined, even kissed, it nonetheless has the full force of a life-size portrait, the lover so fully present as to appear immediately recognisable (a young Ciar\u00e1n Hinds), his message conveyed with dramatic urgency. And Hilliard goes further, exploiting the diminutive scale as no conventional portraitist could. The flames are scattered with powdered gold so that when the picture is turned this way and that, the fire of love leaps into life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf26563c08307cf648d55753b1b56974dd52140a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf26563c08307cf648d55753b1b56974dd52140a/41_52_2330_2934/794.jpg\" alt=\"Unknown Man Against a Background of Flames, by Nicholas Hilliard, c1600.\" width=\"794\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unknown Man Against a Background of Flames, by Nicholas Hilliard, c1600.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clare Johnson/Victoria and Albert Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Described by him as \u201ca thing apart from all other painting or drawing\u201d, the portrait miniatures of Hilliard (1547-1619) and his sometime pupil Isaac Oliver (1565-1617) are not just a unique contribution to the evolution of British painting, but among the great works of European art. Hilliard was the first English artist to be \u201cmuch admired\u201d, a contemporary wrote, \u201camongst strangers\u201d. Prized by Medicis, Hapsburgs and Bourbons, he was compared to Raphael. John Donne, homing in on the genius of his miniatures in comparison to enormous history paintings, wrote that \u201ca hand, or eye/ By Hilliard drawn, is worth an history,/ By a worse painter made\u201d.</p> <p>The hand in a Hilliard is fractional, the eye practically subatomic. Naturally, this is what strikes first in this <a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/elizabethan-treasures/exhibition/\" title=\"\">magnificent show</a>, as you struggle to see how the miracle is achieved through the magnifying glass conveniently supplied. But enlargement turns out to explain nothing of the magic: the air of wayward distractedness in Sir Walter Raleigh\u2019s brilliant blue eyes; the hopeful optimism in the teenage face of Henry, Prince of Wales, with his incipient moustache; the alarming steeliness of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, favourite of Elizabeth I.</p> <p>The queen\u2019s appearance itself, so often painted as little more than a jewelled diagram, bodies forth with far greater plausibility in these miniatures. Hilliard, 30 years a court painter, particularly captures the curious contours of her egg-shaped head, the cavernous eye sockets and protuberant lower lip. Isaac Oliver went further, showing a deep crease in the forehead, thinning hair and a greater protuberance as Gloriana lost her teeth.</p> <p>Sharp sight, close scrutiny; there is some irreducible connection between scale and observation in this art. Hilliard and Oliver are so much more acute than their contemporaries. It is not just that their portraits haven\u2019t the usual stiffness of Elizabethan art, nor its superficial concern with power, but that they seem so probing in their contemplation.</p> <p>Sir Francis Drake, veteran explorer, has weather-reddened cheeks and undeceived eyes. Francis Bacon, future philosopher and statesman, is already exhausted by his own midnight-oil precocity as a shrewd 17-year-old thinker. And if you did not know that Sir Philip Sidney\u2019s sister Mary was herself a considerable writer, you might deduce it from her half-smiling face, quick with intelligent curiosity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7168382cdf8513da9dcec94149588c63b70fdbd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7168382cdf8513da9dcec94149588c63b70fdbd8/0_0_2400_2912/824.jpg\" alt=\"Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, by Isaac Oliver, c. 1596.\" width=\"824\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, by Isaac Oliver, c. 1596.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Private Collection/ \u00a9 Christie's, 2011.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Earl of Southampton, Shakespeare\u2019s patron and (some say) lover, appears in a staggering image by Isaac Oliver, far more revealing than any of the many other likenesses painted during his lifetime. The notorious love lock descends almost to his navel, the high quiff appears to be held aloft with something like sugared water, and his amused round eyes catch yours with an expression of almost unnerving confidence.</p> <p>How these miniatures are made is the subject of a short film and an excellent display at the National Portrait Gallery. Bright as enamel, they are, in fact, painted with something like modern watercolour \u2013 crushed pigment bound with gum \u2013 using humble squirrel-hair brushes. Colossal photographic magnifications show almost imperceptible stipplings and shadings: the single suave line by which Hilliard dashes off an eyelid; Oliver\u2019s gift for a graduated blush.</p> <p>A steady hand was the merest requirement. These artists had to get a likeness down in two or three sittings lasting not much more than an hour \u2013 like Holbein or Van Dyck \u2013 but on a piece of vellum no bigger than a playing card. And cards were the commonest form of support; a portrait of Elizabeth I, in this show, has the Queen of Hearts glued to the back. There is wit in the miniaturist\u2019s art.</p> <p>And it is evident in the face of Hilliard himself, with all his questioning vitality. Sixteenth-century self-portraits are so rare in England that perhaps only three are known: two in oils and this far greater miniature, in which the young painter announces himself as an aristocrat.

      "bodyText": "The man in the picture is on fire with love. Flames surge and ripple around him. Dressed in nothing but a fine lawn undershirt, open almost to the waist, hair slicked back from his beautiful face in the heat, he is all ready for the beloved. A woman whose identity is revealed \u2013 if only we could make it out \u2013 in the miniature dangling from a chain round his neck, a portrait even smaller than this one. She gave herself to him, in private, and now he offers himself in return: a lover burning with passion. Nicholas Hilliard\u2019s Unknown Young Man Against a Background of Flames is a stupendous painting \u2013 overwhelmingly potent and erotic. Yet it is not quite three inches tall. An object made to be held in the hand, to be touched, examined, even kissed, it nonetheless has the full force of a life-size portrait, the lover so fully present as to appear immediately recognisable (a young Ciar\u00e1n Hinds), his message conveyed with dramatic urgency. And Hilliard goes further, exploiting the diminutive scale as no conventional portraitist could. The flames are scattered with powdered gold so that when the picture is turned this way and that, the fire of love leaps into life. Described by him as \u201ca thing apart from all other painting or drawing\u201d, the portrait miniatures of Hilliard (1547-1619) and his sometime pupil Isaac Oliver (1565-1617) are not just a unique contribution to the evolution of British painting, but among the great works of European art. Hilliard was the first English artist to be \u201cmuch admired\u201d, a contemporary wrote, \u201camongst strangers\u201d. Prized by Medicis, Hapsburgs and Bourbons, he was compared to Raphael. John Donne, homing in on the genius of his miniatures in comparison to enormous history paintings, wrote that \u201ca hand, or eye/ By Hilliard drawn, is worth an history,/ By a worse painter made\u201d. The hand in a Hilliard is fractional, the eye practically subatomic. Naturally, this is what strikes first in this magnificent show, as you struggle to see how the miracle is achieved through the magnifying glass conveniently supplied. But enlargement turns out to explain nothing of the magic: the air of wayward distractedness in Sir Walter Raleigh\u2019s brilliant blue eyes; the hopeful optimism in the teenage face of Henry, Prince of Wales, with his incipient moustache; the alarming steeliness of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, favourite of Elizabeth I. The queen\u2019s appearance itself, so often painted as little more than a jewelled diagram, bodies forth with far greater plausibility in these miniatures. Hilliard, 30 years a court painter, particularly captures the curious contours of her egg-shaped head, the cavernous eye sockets and protuberant lower lip. Isaac Oliver went further, showing a deep crease in the forehead, thinning hair and a greater protuberance as Gloriana lost her teeth. Sharp sight, close scrutiny; there is some irreducible connection between scale and observation in this art. Hilliard and Oliver are so much more acute than their contemporaries. It is not just that their portraits haven\u2019t the usual stiffness of Elizabethan art, nor its superficial concern with power, but that they seem so probing in their contemplation. Sir Francis Drake, veteran explorer, has weather-reddened cheeks and undeceived eyes. Francis Bacon, future philosopher and statesman, is already exhausted by his own midnight-oil precocity as a shrewd 17-year-old thinker. And if you did not know that Sir Philip Sidney\u2019s sister Mary was herself a considerable writer, you might deduce it from her half-smiling face, quick with intelligent curiosity. The Earl of Southampton, Shakespeare\u2019s patron and (some say) lover, appears in a staggering image by Isaac Oliver, far more revealing than any of the many other likenesses painted during his lifetime. The notorious love lock descends almost to his navel, the high quiff appears to be held aloft with something like sugared water, and his amused round eyes catch yours with an expression of almost unnerving confidence. How these miniatures are made is the subject of a short film and an excellent display at the National Portrait Gallery. Bright as enamel, they are, in fact, painted with something like modern watercolour \u2013 crushed pigment bound with gum \u2013 using humble squirrel-hair brushes. Colossal photographic magnifications show almost imperceptible stipplings and shadings: the single suave line by which Hilliard dashes off an eyelid; Oliver\u2019s gift for a graduated blush. A steady hand was the merest requirement. These artists had to get a likeness down in two or three sittings lasting not much more than an hour \u2013 like Holbein or Van Dyck \u2013 but on a piece of vellum no bigger than a playing card. And cards were the commonest form of support; a portrait of Elizabeth I, in this show, has the Queen of Hearts glued to the back. There is wit in the miniaturist\u2019s art. And it is evident in the face of Hilliard himself, with all his questioning vitality. Sixteenth-century self-portraits are so rare in England that perhaps only three are known: two in oils and this far greater miniature, in which the young painter announces himself as an aristocrat. Exeter-born, London-trained as a jeweller, Hilliard saw the works of Holbein in England and Clouet in France (Elizabeth had trouble getting him home), and still he seems to have sprung fully formed from nowhere. Oliver has speed, humour, open affection. His terrific portrait of the Browne brothers shows a trio of likely lads entwined like The Three Graces for a lark. His new young wife looks back at the painter with an equal degree of warmth. He appears more modern, continental, broader of stroke, better at perspective. Hilliard is more austere, yet also profound. Hilliard wrote a treatise full of advice for fellow miniaturists. \u201cLet your apparel be silk, such as sheddeth least dust or hairs.\u201d Talk gently to keep your fidgety sitters (notably James I) from moving. Aim for the immediacy of a private encounter, and all \u201cthose lovely graces, witty smilings, and those stolen glances which suddenly like lightning pass\u201d. For these images are unlike any other: intimate objects that may be kept in secret boxes or worn in lockets about the body, brought out for a moment and then hidden away; messages of love, to be passed from hand to hand. And this is nowhere more explicit than in Hilliard\u2019s famously mysterious portrait of 1588, known as Man Clasping a Hand from a Cloud. The identity of the eponymous gentleman, with his pale eyes and fine golden tendrils, has never been established.

      "body": "<p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken up flying,\u201d says Frank Gehry, aged 89 years and 11 months, as he sits opposite me in his Los Angeles office, \u201ca little bit.\u201d Then he tells a story. How in his youth he had a job washing aeroplanes, and how his cousin had a Waco biplane and would take him up in it. How he wanted to do this again. How the subject came up when Sydney Pollack was making the 2005 film <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu9orvtStdY\" title=\"\">Sketches of Frank Gehry</a></em>. How the architect asked the film director, did he know someone who had a Waco?</p> <p>\u201cYes, he did \u2013 Harrison Ford. And I knew Harrison way, way back, when he was a cabinet maker. He bid for some of our projects.\u201d But Gehry never got to fly with the man who played Han Solo. Then, one evening, he was at a dinner party complaining to Ford on the subject when the host chipped in. He had another make of biplane, a Stearman, and was happy to take Gehry into the sky. He shows a photo as proof. \u201cI can\u2019t land it or anything, but he lets me steer it.\u201d</p> <p>The narrative touches on many aspects of Gehry. He is sociable \u2013 his tales tend to involve chains of friends and chance meetings. He has a fascination with celebrity and high-achievers, as many photographs around his office attest: Frank with Herbie Hancock, with Shimon Peres, with champion ice hockey teams, with Princess Diana, with Jasper Johns, with Catherine Zeta-Jones, with Pierre Boulez, with Quincy Jones, with former leaders of Canada and West Germany.</p> <p>Fame is definitely a thing with Gehry, but an ambiguous one. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to realise that this place is still Hollywood,\u201d he says of Los Angeles. \u201cI find that very comforting because there are no spotlights except on Hollywood. It gives you a kind of cloud cover.\u201d He name-drops, but always with an interest in the person as well as the name. He makes it sound both natural and amazing that he knows these people. He equally likes to bring things down to earth (the plane-washing, the cabinet-making). It\u2019s not untypical that a boast (\u201cI\u2019m flying\u201d) is followed by deprecation (\u201ca bit\u201d).</p> <p>Most of all, the biplane story captures his addiction to adventure, physical, emotional and imaginative. It is why he played ice hockey until the age of 72, and why he still takes Foggy, the 23-metre (74ft) yacht that he designed, out into the Pacific Ocean. He sees such openness to chance in the work of the musicians with whom he loves to collaborate \u2013 he\u2019s got a number of designs for performance spaces on the go. \u201cIt\u2019s like jumping off a cliff,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you know what you\u2019re going to do before you\u2019re going to do it, don\u2019t do it.\u201d</p> <p>By way of example he describes his work with the jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter, designing a set for an opera, <em>Iphigenia</em>, that Shorter has written. \u201cThe meetings are hilarious,\u201d says Gehry. \u201cI haven\u2019t a clue what they\u2019re talking about. The pianist starts. Wayne stops her. He goes ta-ta-ta. She knows what he means. It goes on like this for four hours. It\u2019s pure sonic invention.\u201d</p> <p>Leaps into the unknown can be seen in work Gehry did with schoolchildren, in collaboration with his teacher sister, Doreen Nelson, that was captured in a 1972 documentary, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAkXbuc7CCo&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"\">Kid City</a></em>, directed by Jon Boorstin. The children built a city, Purium, out of painted blocks and cardboard, a sort of haphazard anticipation of the architecture Gehry would later do; they debated planning issues and elected a mayor. It was all too chaotic for the children\u2019s regular teacher (and Gehry now regrets his lack of tact with her), who fired the siblings. \u201cThe point she missed,\u201d he says in the film, \u201cis that the conflict, when they start arguing with each other, is the real involvement in the city planning process that they were robbed of.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7d9854f810b3c8811823790f09af45b732f069d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d9854f810b3c8811823790f09af45b732f069d4/170_0_4160_2529/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Danziger Studio and Residence 1965\" width=\"1000\" height=\"608\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Danziger Studio and Residence, Los Angeles, </strong><strong>1965 </strong><br>This early work, for the graphic artist Lou Danziger, beautifully combines workplace, home and courtyard garden.

Fellow architects found it too bold, but many artists loved it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael McNamara</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gehry\u2019s life story has a number of cliff jumps, which take on a mythic quality in the retelling. One was his name change, from Goldberg. His first wife, Anita Snyder, who like Gehry is Jewish, felt that a less Jewish-sounding name would offer some protection from antisemitism. As she had put up with the stresses of living with a fledgling architect, he felt he owed her something and agreed. But why, of all names, Gehry? He takes a napkin and signs his former and present surnames on it. Goldberg, the way he writes it, has big descending loops on the \u201cg\u201ds at beginning and end, and three verticals \u2013 l, d, b \u2013 in the middle. The \u201cg\u201d and the \u201cy\u201d of Gehry have the same loops. There\u2019s only one vertical, the \u201ch\u201d, but the architecture of the two names was similar enough to satisfy him.</p> <p>The most pivotal jump concerns the <a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/67321/gehry-residence-frank-gehry\" title=\"\">house in Santa Monica where Gehry lived until recently</a> (they now live in a house designed by their son) with his second wife, Berta, which he remodelled in the 1970s with all the disrespect for convention for which he was not yet world-famous \u2013 jagged angles, rough edges, unglamorous materials such as plywood, chain link fencing and corrugated sheet metal. At that time, Gehry had built up a successful practice designing not-bad but not-exceptional commercial projects \u2013 apartment blocks, offices, shopping centres \u2013 with a sideline doing houses and studios for his artist friends. In 1980 he hosted a dinner at his house to celebrate the opening of a not-bad shopping centre. His developer client looked around him. \u201cIs this what you like?\u201d he asked. Gehry said he did. \u201cWell, if you like this you can\u2019t possibly like that,\u201d said the client, pointing in the direction of the shopping centre, \u201cso why are you doing it?\u201d So Gehry, aged a little past 50, stopped working on all his commercial projects and shrunk his office. He chose, almost, to start over again.</p> <p>As midlife crises go, it was one of the more creative and productive ones. If Gehry struggled for a while, going through what I\u2019m told were very lean times, he would in time build up a reputation among architectural cognoscenti based on small- to medium-sized projects: more houses, a law school, a library, an ice rink. With the opening of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/oct/08/architecture.bilbao\" title=\"\">the Bilbao Guggenheim</a> in 1997 his success became both popular and global. This celebrated constellation of titanium and stone, this fantastical ark of art on the banks of the river Nervi\u00f3n, gave its name to a phenomenon \u2013 the Bilbao effect \u2013 whereby <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/apr/30/bilbao-effect-gehry-guggenheim-history-cities-50-buildings\" title=\"\">beaten-up old cities would try to reverse their fortunes with spectacular architecture</a>. It became the icon of what would be called iconic architecture.</p> <p>Other landmarks followed, such as the Walt Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles, which opened in 2003. (In fact it was commissioned before Bilbao, but drawn out by, among other things, Gehry\u2019s battles to convince clients and funders that he really should be allowed to build it.) By the time Pollack made his feature-length documentary, it was common to call Gehry a \u201cgenius\u201d, a \u201cmodern master\u201d, \u201cthe greatest architect in the world\u201d. He appeared in cartoon form on <em>The Simpsons</em><em> </em>and was befriended by the architecture-loving Brad Pitt. Later, Mark Zuckerberg paid a visit to his studio, a hangar of controlled creative confusion in what used to be a BMW factory, and said that this was just how Facebook liked to work. He has commissioned 10 projects from Gehry to date, on the tech company\u2019s Silicon Valley campus and elsewhere.</p> <p>Meaghan Lloyd, a partner in the practice, gives a tour of projects now on the go. There are twin silvery skyscrapers in Toronto, the city of Gehry\u2019s birth. In Arles, southern France, the twisted and glittering tower of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/apr/10/fine-art-or-daring-design-13-new-must-visit-galleries-and-museums-in-europe\" title=\"\">Luma, an arts centre </a>founded by the Swiss collector Maja Hoffmann, is nearing completion. The Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi, approaching three times the size of the one in Bilbao, commissioned in 2006 but then stalled, is back on. So is the 447ft-long Eisenhower memorial in Washington DC, which was paused by controversy. Among other things, the general/president\u2019s family didn\u2019t like Gehry\u2019s initial idea of stressing his humble origins in Abilene, Kansas. They wanted something more obviously heroic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"866df56612576a65fe4dc57c44cf26761ef4ce33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/866df56612576a65fe4dc57c44cf26761ef4ce33/0_0_5029_3349/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gehry Residence 1978\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Gehry Residence, Santa Monica, </strong><strong>1978</strong><br>\u201cWe\u2019d been told that it was haunted,\u201d says Gehry of the home he remodelled for himself and his family, \u201cso I decided that the ghost was a cubist.\u201d The result was an explosion of everyday building materials around an everyday timber house. Neighbours hated it, sued or threatened Gehry with prison, but it made his name.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Susan Wood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gehry, in short, who turns 90 on Thursday, is not slowing down much. He says that he wouldn\u2019t know how to retire. \u201cI love working. I love working things out. I love the client interaction \u2013 I think it\u2019s a 50-50 game. I love that we do what we do, and bring it in under budget, which no one believes, but it\u2019s true.\u201d</p> <p>More than the prestige projects that Lloyd showed me, Gehry wants to talk about his plan for building <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/sep/14/frank-gehry-los-angeles-river\" title=\"\">a community park and cultural centre (among other things) over a section of the Los Angeles River</a> \u2013 a 50-mile concrete ditch containing a trickle that sometimes becomes a flood \u2013 in the district of Cudahy. He also talks about the conversion of an old <a href=\"https://la.curbed.com/2018/8/16/17699030/frank-gehry-inglewood-la-philharmonic-youth-orchestra\" title=\"\">bank building into a home for the Youth Orchestra Los Angeles</a> in Inglewood. Cudahy and Inglewood are both places, Lloyd tells me, with \u201copportunity gaps\u201d.</p> <p>Gehry particularly likes talking about the <a href=\"https://boulezsaal.de/\" title=\"\">Pierre Boulez Saal</a> in Berlin, completed in 2017, where his 90th birthday party will be held. This serves the musical academy that has grown out of the ideas hatched, 20 or more years ago, between the Jewish pianist and conductor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/23/israel-racist-new-law-ashamed-apartheid-daniel-barenboim\" title=\"\">Daniel Barenboim</a> and the Palestinian intellectual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/sep/28/highereducation.israelandthepalestinians\" title=\"\">Edward Said</a>, of overcoming political divides through teaching and performing music. It is a comparatively modest project, being the insertion of a 682-seat auditorium into a former depot for stage sets, but it brings together phenomena fundamental to Gehry: a love of music, a wish to do good in the world, and his own identity and family history as a secular Jew.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m an atheist,\u201d he says, \u201cI don\u2019t care about all that. I saw things happening in Israel that I couldn\u2019t feel good about. But \u2013 I\u2019ll start crying \u2013 when I was a young kid with my father in a synagogue in Timmins, Ontario, in the 1930s, where I\u2019d been beaten up a lot for killing Christ, he was not school educated, but he got up and made a speech.\u201d It was about the idea of a Jewish homeland in the context of the antisemitism that the family had to face. \u201cThe speech was so powerful. It never left me.</p> <p>\u201cThen I heard that Daniel and Edward Said had a proposal for speaking to each other through music. It was something I totally believed in.\u201d Eventually, through a typically Gehry-esque web of events, chance and connections \u2013 including the composer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/06/pierre-boulez\" title=\"\">Pierre Boulez</a> and the head of the Juilliard school for performing arts, imaginary concert halls that Gehry asked his students at Yale to design, and an unrealised commission from another client for a concert hall in Istanbul \u2013 he was asked to design the new hall. Its final form is a wooden oval, with the audience intimate and close to the performers, and an undulating balcony above. Its geometry, Gehry is delighted to point out, happens to match that of one of the masterpieces of baroque architecture, the church of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane in Rome.</p> <p>This was designed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/feb/05/borromini-book-kerry-downes-architecture\" title=\"\">Francesco Borromini</a>, the melancholic 17th-century genius whom Gehry often credits as an inspiration. For all that Gehry personifies a California spirit of invention, he knows his history. He recalls soaking up the stuff when he and Anita Snyder lived in Paris for a year, about 1960. \u201cAt the weekends we drove to Brussels, to Holland, wherever we could. I visited the whole of the Loire.\u201d He fell in love with the sculpture of the Romanesque artist Gislebertus in Autun, how it is \u201ctough and related to the architecture\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"63c48990e2cef51b1b108fba8346900177e8b40b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63c48990e2cef51b1b108fba8346900177e8b40b/0_0_3650_4597/794.jpg\" alt=\"Edgemar shopping centre 1988\" width=\"794\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Edgemar shopping centre, Santa Monica, </strong><strong>1988 </strong><br>Edgemar was a mixed-use development of shops, offices, restaurant, studios and a small museum.

Gehry\u2019s Abu Dhabi Guggenheim clients liked its chain link sun screens so much that they\u2019ll be making a comeback in the Gulf.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: View Pictures/UIG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Gehry, these past figures are still vital. \u201cThis is my north star,\u201d he says, pointing at a large photograph of the ancient bronze <a href=\"https://www.ancient-greece.org/art/chiarioteer.html\" title=\"\">Charioteer of Delphi</a>, whose beautiful drapery might be considered a refined cousin of Gehry\u2019s buildings\u2019 folds and crumples. \u201cFifty years ago I visited Delphi and saw that statue. The label said \u2018artist unknown\u2019. It made me cry, that someone could make something with inert materials that could move someone thousands of years later.\u201d Architecture, he believes, belongs in the same company as the charioteer: \u201cThere\u2019s historical proof it was considered as art. Somehow it got segued into not being, and being kind of run by commercial culture.\u201d</p> <p>So the Gehry universe is richly and diversely populated. It includes without much distinction long-dead artists as much as living stars, sportsmen, politicians, musicians \u2013 pretty much anyone, famous or not, who is active rather than inert, something rather than nothing. It includes the children in <em>Kid City</em> and the characters in the children\u2019s animation <em>Arthur</em>, in which a cartoon Gehry (with little furry animal ears) helps them rebuild a treehouse. He guides them away from their wilder fantasies (it could be a giant pizza, a space-rocket-castle) towards \u2013 because that\u2019s what they really want \u2013 something much like the treehouse they had before.</p> <p>Gehry can make connections between the living and dead and between art forms and cultures. Meeting Jay-Z at a basketball game and not knowing what to say, he asked who was the first rapper, before making his own suggestion: James Joyce. Who\u2019s that, asked Jay-Z. So Gehry sent him recordings of Joyce reciting passages from <em>Finnegans Wake</em>. Jay-Z hasn\u2019t replied yet, even though Gehry got a mutual friend, Bono, who does know who Joyce was, to nudge him.</p> <p>The architect\u2019s world also includes rogues. Gehry\u2019s career has brought him into contact with President Erdo\u011fan of Turkey, then in his first month in office (\u201cI realised he was a monster\u201d), with President Maduro of Venezuela (\u201che was scary\u201d), and with Boris Johnson (\u201cwhat an asshole\u201d, he says, when I describe the MP\u2019s conversion to Brexit). He once declined an invitation from Donald Trump to design the tallest tower in New York. \u201cHe just couldn\u2019t deal with being turned down. He said, \u2018I\u2019ll do it with or without you.\u2019 He slammed the door on me.\u201d Later, when they happened to meet at some fundraising dinner, Trump turned his chair round to present his back to Gehry. \u201cI said, \u2018You don\u2019t need to do that. Be civil.\u2019 He said, \u2018I don\u2019t need you.\u2019\u201d But Trump never did build that tower.</p> <p>Many architects like to talk about the importance of people, but they are often abstract ciphers employed to decorate their visualisations. For Gehry it\u2019s roughly the other way round: his buildings are, like the people who fascinate him, vivid characters. Materials, almost, have feelings. He psychoanalyses chain link, the material with which he was most often associated in the pre-Bilbao, pre-titanium days: \u201cI realised that the world was filled with ugly stuff and nobody seemed to care. There was a lot of denial. I talked to a lot of shrinks about denialism and I got really interested in how that affects architecture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"98eff98a025fb016eeee1852ff5bac76997d95d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98eff98a025fb016eeee1852ff5bac76997d95d1/0_0_3280_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bilbao Guggenheim 1997\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Bilbao Guggenheim,</strong><strong> 1997 </strong><br>The titanium-clad art museum that put its host city on the tourist map. A popular and critical success that has been much imitated but never equalled. Such objections as there are argue that the showy architecture overwhelms the art. Gehry\u2019s response is to quote artists \u2013 Richard Serra, Cy Twombly \u2013 who say they love exhibiting there.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI said to myself, what is the material that everyone hates the most and uses the most? Bingo! Chain link.\u201d</p> <p>So he went to the factory that supplied most of Los Angeles\u2019 chain link, with a machine that could make about 15 miles of it per hour. He tried to find ways to make it beautiful \u2013 multiplying its layers, getting it to cast cooling shadows, getting it to look like diaphanous veils. He\u2019d get introduced at parties as \u201cthe chain link man\u201d. A lawyer friend couldn\u2019t understand this preoccupation, so Gehry pointed out that his tennis court, surrounded with a chain link fence, was visible from every room in the lawyer\u2019s house. \u201cI know you hate chain link,\u201d said Gehry, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I must have had some effect on you. I must have made you like it.\u201d</p> <p>His interest in a fencing material was part of a wider interest in the sprawling city around him which, for all that it exports dreams around the world, was not always admired for its physical fabric. Gehry\u2019s earlier work always drew inspiration from Los Angeles: from the way cheap timber-framed construction can look both flimsy and substantial, from the effects of light and shade in the balmy climate, from the things you can do with plywood. Mostly, his fellow architects didn\u2019t understand what he was doing, but the artists that he befriended did. It was about responding to the world as you found it.</p> <p>At this point, although he was fond of the odd irregular angle, Gehry\u2019s work didn\u2019t have the unpredictable forms for which he became famous. His later projects, more prestigious, more global, are more extravagant in their shape and generous in their specification. He wants everyone to know, however, that he continued to care about the way they are made. Great thought and considerable computing power, he stresses, were put into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jul/05/frank-gehry-8-spruce-street\" title=\"\">the rippling form of his 2010 Spruce Street residential tower </a>in New York\u2019s downtown, such that it cost no more than a conventional shape.</p> <p>He is sensitive to the criticism that his more spectacular work is a series of signature gestures. He hates the label \u201cstarchitect\u201d that got stuck to him, along with Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas and others, some time earlier in this millennium. He is, however, able to convey his feelings with humour: once, as I was preparing to take part in a symposium on the sins of starchitecture, a Fedex parcel arrived from his Los Angeles office. It contained T-shirts for the participants, designed by a friend of Gehry\u2019s. \u201cFuck Frank Gehry\u201d, they said.</p> <p>For myself, Gehry has always been there. As a student in the 1980s, when postmodernism was bloating, and where there seemed to be precious little inspiration beyond British hi-tech, it was a revelation to find someone who could be so inventive, so enjoyable and so free, while still to the point. His buildings do what they are supposed to do and then add more. They are generous. They are not embarrassed by inhabitation, as some architecture is, but enhanced by it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3af086ebcd99b24b813d7ea74be7912008d509a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3af086ebcd99b24b813d7ea74be7912008d509a5/0_0_3413_5120/667.jpg\" alt=\"8 Spruce Street, New York 2010\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>8 Spruce Street, New York,</strong><strong> 2010 </strong><br>Manhattan is the hardest stage on which to design a skyscraper \u2013 what can be added to the home of the Chrysler, Empire State and Woolworth buildings? 8 Spruce Street, or New York by Gehry (as the marketing people call it), pulls it off. It is distinctive and new, but seems to belong in its eminent company.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Hicks/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I left university, I took myself to California and wrote some of my early articles about him, and about like-minded architects around him. Bilbao, not yet tainted by retrospective guilt-by-association with the later absurdities of \u201ciconic\u201d architecture, was another blast of positive energy \u2013 here, after decades in which it was a given that anything liked by the architectural community would be hated by the general public, was a critical and popular success combined. It also, as both imitators and critics have failed to understand, is particular to its place. It engages in a robust conversation, a friendly pushing-and-pulling with its neighbours: 19th-century apartments, a big bridge, a river with an industrial past, a craggy landscape.</p> <p>Sometimes the critics are right. Sometimes the shape-making detaches itself from other forms of reality and becomes a self-referential exercise on its own. It can be a bad sign when Gehry uses metaphors too glibly, when, as with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/21/frank-gehry-fondation-louis-vuitton-shows-he-doesnt-know-when-to-stop\" title=\"\">the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris</a> or with his IAC headquarters next to the High Line in New York, he says that a building is like the sails of a ship. Images like this can be used to justify almost anything. They can camouflage a lack of what is elsewhere Gehry\u2019s strongest quality, his engagement with what is around.</p> <p>Recently I went to Arles, to see the not-quite complete Luma arts centre. Gehry says it\u2019s inspired by the paintings of Vincent van Gogh, who lived and worked in the city: its specially deformed stainless steel cladding is designed to reflect the light that he painted. \u201cLook, it\u2019s <em>The Starry Night</em>,\u201d Gehry says of a deep-blue picture of the building that has tumbled out of Instagram. It is, but the nubby tower could just as well be the stump of Van Gogh\u2019s ravaged ear.</p> <p>It\u2019s mad. It\u2019s excessive. But something wonderful could be climbing out of the building site, in the spaces that are made when the steel nubs intersect with a glass drum at the tower\u2019s base. The deformed steel does indeed do amazing things with light. And you can only admire someone who keeps driving himself to make such things, with all the exposure to criticism and self-doubt it must entail. Beyond that, I\u2019d trust Gehry to do a better concert hall or a better skyscraper than any other architect working today.</p> <p>I see Frank Gehry on a Monday, the day after he has arrived back from a quick trip to Paris, and again on the Wednesday. He has meanwhile been diagnosed with pneumonia. \u201cI nearly died,\u201d he says. \u201cMy doctor said that, if I went to Paris, I might get pneumonia. But I went anyway.\u201d He doesn\u2019t seem too worried: \u201cThey\u2019ve got it under control.\u201d Another cliff jumped, then.</p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\" title=\"\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\" title=\"\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardiancities/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Instagram</a> to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter</em></p>",

How in his youth he had a job washing aeroplanes, and how his cousin had a Waco biplane and would take him up in it. How he wanted to do this again. How the subject came up when Sydney Pollack was making the 2005 film Sketches of Frank Gehry. How the architect asked the film director, did he know someone who had a Waco? \u201cYes, he did \u2013 Harrison Ford. And I knew Harrison way, way back, when he was a cabinet maker. He bid for some of our projects.\u201d But Gehry never got to fly with the man who played Han Solo. Then, one evening, he was at a dinner party complaining to Ford on the subject when the host chipped in. He had another make of biplane, a Stearman, and was happy to take Gehry into the sky. He shows a photo as proof. \u201cI can\u2019t land it or anything, but he lets me steer it.\u201d The narrative touches on many aspects of Gehry. He is sociable \u2013 his tales tend to involve chains of friends and chance meetings. He has a fascination with celebrity and high-achievers, as many photographs around his office attest: Frank with Herbie Hancock, with Shimon Peres, with champion ice hockey teams, with Princess Diana, with Jasper Johns, with Catherine Zeta-Jones, with Pierre Boulez, with Quincy Jones, with former leaders of Canada and West Germany. Fame is definitely a thing with Gehry, but an ambiguous one. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to realise that this place is still Hollywood,\u201d he says of Los Angeles. \u201cI find that very comforting because there are no spotlights except on Hollywood. It gives you a kind of cloud cover.\u201d He name-drops, but always with an interest in the person as well as the name. He makes it sound both natural and amazing that he knows these people. He equally likes to bring things down to earth (the plane-washing, the cabinet-making). It\u2019s not untypical that a boast (\u201cI\u2019m flying\u201d) is followed by deprecation (\u201ca bit\u201d). Most of all, the biplane story captures his addiction to adventure, physical, emotional and imaginative. It is why he played ice hockey until the age of 72, and why he still takes Foggy, the 23-metre (74ft) yacht that he designed, out into the Pacific Ocean. He sees such openness to chance in the work of the musicians with whom he loves to collaborate \u2013 he\u2019s got a number of designs for performance spaces on the go. \u201cIt\u2019s like jumping off a cliff,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you know what you\u2019re going to do before you\u2019re going to do it, don\u2019t do it.\u201d By way of example he describes his work with the jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter, designing a set for an opera, Iphigenia, that Shorter has written. \u201cThe meetings are hilarious,\u201d says Gehry. \u201cI haven\u2019t a clue what they\u2019re talking about. The pianist starts. Wayne stops her. He goes ta-ta-ta. She knows what he means. It goes on like this for four hours. It\u2019s pure sonic invention.\u201d Leaps into the unknown can be seen in work Gehry did with schoolchildren, in collaboration with his teacher sister, Doreen Nelson, that was captured in a 1972 documentary, Kid City, directed by Jon Boorstin. The children built a city, Purium, out of painted blocks and cardboard, a sort of haphazard anticipation of the architecture Gehry would later do; they debated planning issues and elected a mayor. It was all too chaotic for the children\u2019s regular teacher (and Gehry now regrets his lack of tact with her), who fired the siblings. \u201cThe point she missed,\u201d he says in the film, \u201cis that the conflict, when they start arguing with each other, is the real involvement in the city planning process that they were robbed of.\u201d Gehry\u2019s life story has a number of cliff jumps, which take on a mythic quality in the retelling. One was his name change, from Goldberg. His first wife, Anita Snyder, who like Gehry is Jewish, felt that a less Jewish-sounding name would offer some protection from antisemitism. As she had put up with the stresses of living with a fledgling architect, he felt he owed her something and agreed. But why, of all names, Gehry? He takes a napkin and signs his former and present surnames on it. Goldberg, the way he writes it, has big descending loops on the \u201cg\u201ds at beginning and end, and three verticals \u2013 l, d, b \u2013 in the middle. The \u201cg\u201d and the \u201cy\u201d of Gehry have the same loops. There\u2019s only one vertical, the \u201ch\u201d, but the architecture of the two names was similar enough to satisfy him. The most pivotal jump concerns the house in Santa Monica where Gehry lived until recently (they now live in a house designed by their son) with his second wife, Berta, which he remodelled in the 1970s with all the disrespect for convention for which he was not yet world-famous \u2013 jagged angles, rough edges, unglamorous materials such as plywood, chain link fencing and corrugated sheet metal. At that time, Gehry had built up a successful practice designing not-bad but not-exceptional commercial projects \u2013 apartment blocks, offices, shopping centres \u2013 with a sideline doing houses and studios for his artist friends. In 1980 he hosted a dinner at his house to celebrate the opening of a not-bad shopping centre. His developer client looked around him. \u201cIs this what you like?\u201d he asked. Gehry said he did. \u201cWell, if you like this you can\u2019t possibly like that,\u201d said the client, pointing in the direction of the shopping centre, \u201cso why are you doing it?\u201d So Gehry, aged a little past 50, stopped working on all his commercial projects and shrunk his office. He chose, almost, to start over again. As midlife crises go, it was one of the more creative and productive ones. If Gehry struggled for a while, going through what I\u2019m told were very lean times, he would in time build up a reputation among architectural cognoscenti based on small- to medium-sized projects: more houses, a law school, a library, an ice rink. With the opening of the Bilbao Guggenheim in 1997 his success became both popular and global. This celebrated constellation of titanium and stone, this fantastical ark of art on the banks of the river Nervi\u00f3n, gave its name to a phenomenon \u2013 the Bilbao effect \u2013 whereby beaten-up old cities would try to reverse their fortunes with spectacular architecture. It became the icon of what would be called iconic architecture. Other landmarks followed, such as the Walt Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles, which opened in 2003. (In fact it was commissioned before Bilbao, but drawn out by, among other things, Gehry\u2019s battles to convince clients and funders that he really should be allowed to build it.) By the time Pollack made his feature-length documentary, it was common to call Gehry a \u201cgenius\u201d, a \u201cmodern master\u201d, \u201cthe greatest architect in the world\u201d. He appeared in cartoon form on The Simpsons and was befriended by the architecture-loving Brad Pitt. Later, Mark Zuckerberg paid a visit to his studio, a hangar of controlled creative confusion in what used to be a BMW factory, and said that this was just how Facebook liked to work. He has commissioned 10 projects from Gehry to date, on the tech company\u2019s Silicon Valley campus and elsewhere. Meaghan Lloyd, a partner in the practice, gives a tour of projects now on the go. There are twin silvery skyscrapers in Toronto, the city of Gehry\u2019s birth. In Arles, southern France, the twisted and glittering tower of Luma, an arts centre founded by the Swiss collector Maja Hoffmann, is nearing completion. The Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi, approaching three times the size of the one in Bilbao, commissioned in 2006 but then stalled, is back on. So is the 447ft-long Eisenhower memorial in Washington DC, which was paused by controversy. Among other things, the general/president\u2019s family didn\u2019t like Gehry\u2019s initial idea of stressing his humble origins in Abilene, Kansas. They wanted something more obviously heroic. Gehry, in short, who turns 90 on Thursday, is not slowing down much. He says that he wouldn\u2019t know how to retire. \u201cI love working. I love working things out. I love the client interaction \u2013 I think it\u2019s a 50-50 game. I love that we do what we do, and bring it in under budget, which no one believes, but it\u2019s true.\u201d More than the prestige projects that Lloyd showed me, Gehry wants to talk about his plan for building a community park and cultural centre (among other things) over a section of the Los Angeles River \u2013 a 50-mile concrete ditch containing a trickle that sometimes becomes a flood \u2013 in the district of Cudahy. He also talks about the conversion of an old bank building into a home for the Youth Orchestra Los Angeles in Inglewood. Cudahy and Inglewood are both places, Lloyd tells me, with \u201copportunity gaps\u201d. Gehry particularly likes talking about the Pierre Boulez Saal in Berlin, completed in 2017, where his 90th birthday party will be held. This serves the musical academy that has grown out of the ideas hatched, 20 or more years ago, between the Jewish pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim and the Palestinian intellectual Edward Said, of overcoming political divides through teaching and performing music. It is a comparatively modest project, being the insertion of a 682-seat auditorium into a former depot for stage sets, but it brings together phenomena fundamental to Gehry: a love of music, a wish to do good in the world, and his own identity and family history as a secular Jew. \u201cI\u2019m an atheist,\u201d he says, \u201cI don\u2019t care about all that. I saw things happening in Israel that I couldn\u2019t feel good about. But \u2013 I\u2019ll start crying \u2013 when I was a young kid with my father in a synagogue in Timmins, Ontario, in the 1930s, where I\u2019d been beaten up a lot for killing Christ, he was not school educated, but he got up and made a speech.\u201d It was about the idea of a Jewish homeland in the context of the antisemitism that the family had to face. \u201cThe speech was so powerful. It never left me. \u201cThen I heard that Daniel and Edward Said had a proposal for speaking to each other through music. It was something I totally believed in.\u201d Eventually, through a typically Gehry-esque web of events, chance and connections \u2013 including the composer Pierre Boulez and the head of the Juilliard school for performing arts, imaginary concert halls that Gehry asked his students at Yale to design, and an unrealised commission from another client for a concert hall in Istanbul \u2013 he was asked to design the new hall. Its final form is a wooden oval, with the audience intimate and close to the performers, and an undulating balcony above. Its geometry, Gehry is delighted to point out, happens to match that of one of the masterpieces of baroque architecture, the church of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane in Rome. This was designed by Francesco Borromini, the melancholic 17th-century genius whom Gehry often credits as an inspiration. For all that Gehry personifies a California spirit of invention, he knows his history. He recalls soaking up the stuff when he and Anita Snyder lived in Paris for a year, about 1960. \u201cAt the weekends we drove to Brussels, to Holland, wherever we could. I visited the whole of the Loire.\u201d He fell in love with the sculpture of the Romanesque artist Gislebertus in Autun, how it is \u201ctough and related to the architecture\u201d. For Gehry, these past figures are still vital. \u201cThis is my north star,\u201d he says, pointing at a large photograph of the ancient bronze Charioteer of Delphi, whose beautiful drapery might be considered a refined cousin of Gehry\u2019s buildings\u2019 folds and crumples. \u201cFifty years ago I visited Delphi and saw that statue. The label said \u2018artist unknown\u2019. It made me cry, that someone could make something with inert materials that could move someone thousands of years later.\u201d Architecture, he believes, belongs in the same company as the charioteer: \u201cThere\u2019s historical proof it was considered as art. Somehow it got segued into not being, and being kind of run by commercial culture.\u201d So the Gehry universe is richly and diversely populated. It includes without much distinction long-dead artists as much as living stars, sportsmen, politicians, musicians \u2013 pretty much anyone, famous or not, who is active rather than inert, something rather than nothing. It includes the children in Kid City and the characters in the children\u2019s animation Arthur, in which a cartoon Gehry (with little furry animal ears) helps them rebuild a treehouse. He guides them away from their wilder fantasies (it could be a giant pizza, a space-rocket-castle) towards \u2013 because that\u2019s what they really want \u2013 something much like the treehouse they had before. Gehry can make connections between the living and dead and between art forms and cultures. Meeting Jay-Z at a basketball game and not knowing what to say, he asked who was the first rapper, before making his own suggestion: James Joyce. Who\u2019s that, asked Jay-Z. So Gehry sent him recordings of Joyce reciting passages from Finnegans Wake. Jay-Z hasn\u2019t replied yet, even though Gehry got a mutual friend, Bono, who does know who Joyce was, to nudge him. The architect\u2019s world also includes rogues. Gehry\u2019s career has brought him into contact with President Erdo\u011fan of Turkey, then in his first month in office (\u201cI realised he was a monster\u201d), with President Maduro of Venezuela (\u201che was scary\u201d), and with Boris Johnson (\u201cwhat an asshole\u201d, he says, when I describe the MP\u2019s conversion to Brexit). He once declined an invitation from Donald Trump to design the tallest tower in New York. \u201cHe just couldn\u2019t deal with being turned down. He said, \u2018I\u2019ll do it with or without you.\u2019 He slammed the door on me.\u201d Later, when they happened to meet at some fundraising dinner, Trump turned his chair round to present his back to Gehry. \u201cI said, \u2018You don\u2019t need to do that. Be civil.\u2019 He said, \u2018I don\u2019t need you.\u2019\u201d But Trump never did build that tower. Many architects like to talk about the importance of people, but they are often abstract ciphers employed to decorate their visualisations. For Gehry it\u2019s roughly the other way round: his buildings are, like the people who fascinate him, vivid characters. Materials, almost, have feelings. He psychoanalyses chain link, the material with which he was most often associated in the pre-Bilbao, pre-titanium days: \u201cI realised that the world was filled with ugly stuff and nobody seemed to care. There was a lot of denial. I talked to a lot of shrinks about denialism and I got really interested in how that affects architecture. \u201cI said to myself, what is the material that everyone hates the most and uses the most? Bingo! Chain link.\u201d So he went to the factory that supplied most of Los Angeles\u2019 chain link, with a machine that could make about 15 miles of it per hour. He tried to find ways to make it beautiful \u2013 multiplying its layers, getting it to cast cooling shadows, getting it to look like diaphanous veils. He\u2019d get introduced at parties as \u201cthe chain link man\u201d. A lawyer friend couldn\u2019t understand this preoccupation, so Gehry pointed out that his tennis court, surrounded with a chain link fence, was visible from every room in the lawyer\u2019s house. \u201cI know you hate chain link,\u201d said Gehry, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I must have had some effect on you. I must have made you like it.\u201d His interest in a fencing material was part of a wider interest in the sprawling city around him which, for all that it exports dreams around the world, was not always admired for its physical fabric. Gehry\u2019s earlier work always drew inspiration from Los Angeles: from the way cheap timber-framed construction can look both flimsy and substantial, from the effects of light and shade in the balmy climate, from the things you can do with plywood. Mostly, his fellow architects didn\u2019t understand what he was doing, but the artists that he befriended did. It was about responding to the world as you found it. At this point, although he was fond of the odd irregular angle, Gehry\u2019s work didn\u2019t have the unpredictable forms for which he became famous. His later projects, more prestigious, more global, are more extravagant in their shape and generous in their specification. He wants everyone to know, however, that he continued to care about the way they are made. Great thought and considerable computing power, he stresses, were put into the rippling form of his 2010 Spruce Street residential tower in New York\u2019s downtown, such that it cost no more than a conventional shape. He is sensitive to the criticism that his more spectacular work is a series of signature gestures. He hates the label \u201cstarchitect\u201d that got stuck to him, along with Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas and others, some time earlier in this millennium. He is, however, able to convey his feelings with humour: once, as I was preparing to take part in a symposium on the sins of starchitecture, a Fedex parcel arrived from his Los Angeles office. It contained T-shirts for the participants, designed by a friend of Gehry\u2019s. \u201cFuck Frank Gehry\u201d, they said. For myself, Gehry has always been there. As a student in the 1980s, when postmodernism was bloating, and where there seemed to be precious little inspiration beyond British hi-tech, it was a revelation to find someone who could be so inventive, so enjoyable and so free, while still to the point. His buildings do what they are supposed to do and then add more. They are generous. They are not embarrassed by inhabitation, as some architecture is, but enhanced by it. When I left university, I took myself to California and wrote some of my early articles about him, and about like-minded architects around him. Bilbao, not yet tainted by retrospective guilt-by-association with the later absurdities of \u201ciconic\u201d architecture, was another blast of positive energy \u2013 here, after decades in which it was a given that anything liked by the architectural community would be hated by the general public, was a critical and popular success combined. It also, as both imitators and critics have failed to understand, is particular to its place. It engages in a robust conversation, a friendly pushing-and-pulling with its neighbours: 19th-century apartments, a big bridge, a river with an industrial past, a craggy landscape. Sometimes the critics are right. Sometimes the shape-making detaches itself from other forms of reality and becomes a self-referential exercise on its own. It can be a bad sign when Gehry uses metaphors too glibly, when, as with the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris or with his IAC headquarters next to the High Line in New York, he says that a building is like the sails of a ship. Images like this can be used to justify almost anything. They can camouflage a lack of what is elsewhere Gehry\u2019s strongest quality, his engagement with what is around. Recently I went to Arles, to see the not-quite complete Luma arts centre. Gehry says it\u2019s inspired by the paintings of Vincent van Gogh, who lived and worked in the city: its specially deformed stainless steel cladding is designed to reflect the light that he painted. \u201cLook, it\u2019s The Starry Night,\u201d Gehry says of a deep-blue picture of the building that has tumbled out of Instagram. It is, but the nubby tower could just as well be the stump of Van Gogh\u2019s ravaged ear. It\u2019s mad. It\u2019s excessive. But something wonderful could be climbing out of the building site, in the spaces that are made when the steel nubs intersect with a glass drum at the tower\u2019s base. The deformed steel does indeed do amazing things with light. And you can only admire someone who keeps driving himself to make such things, with all the exposure to criticism and self-doubt it must entail. Beyond that, I\u2019d trust Gehry to do a better concert hall or a better skyscraper than any other architect working today. I see Frank Gehry on a Monday, the day after he has arrived back from a quick trip to Paris, and again on the Wednesday. He has meanwhile been diagnosed with pneumonia. \u201cI nearly died,\u201d he says. \u201cMy doctor said that, if I went to Paris, I might get pneumonia. But I went anyway.\u201d He doesn\u2019t seem too worried: \u201cThey\u2019ve got it under control.\u201d Another cliff jumped, then.

Malcolm anticipates the present of his dreams, \u201ca FZY Apache 321, hi-def screen, 4.0 GHz processor speed laptop with quad speakers and Nahimic virtual surround sound\u201d. What he gets is a chinchilla. Malcolm isn\u2019t happy (\u201cI don\u2019t love him\u201d). Traumatised by \u201cthe monkey moment\u201d at the zoo when he was six (it involved poo), he just doesn\u2019t get his family\u2019s mad love for animals (as he sings in a number rhyming \u201cvery thorough\u201d with \u201cDavid Attenborough\u201d). A school trip to Orwell Farm, an encounter with a Himalayan goat called K-Pax and... Enough! No spoilers! Not everyone has read the award-winning 2017 David Baddiel novel on which this cheery new musical (score by David Perkins) is based. Adam Fletcher-Forde\u2019s adaptation for children\u2019s company Story Pocket Theatre follows the book\u2019s story fairly faithfully \u2013 perhaps too faithfully; more a copy of Baddiel\u2019s playful narrative than its full translation into stage action (Fletcher-Forde co-directs with Julia Black). Interest is strongly visual. The six-strong cast, aided by Jacqueline Trousdale\u2019s imaginative costume designs, deftly metamorphoses into an entertaining menagerie of variously shell-bearing, hoofed (cloven and not), woolly, feathered and poo-throwing creatures. Actor-manipulated puppets further boost animal numbers, while points of view are multiplied by black-and-white animations of drawings by Jim Field (illustrator of the book). At the heart of the tale, Adam Colborne as Malcolm cannily balances bewilderment, disquiet and excitement in just the right proportions to engage a young audience (and adults too). \u2022 AniMalcolm tours until 28 April",

Looking for something to read at her wedding that doesn\u2019t come either from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/06/elizabeth-browning-five-best-poems\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</a> or Margery Williams\u2019s <em>The Velveteen Rabbit</em>, she picks up a book she once carefully annotated in pencil: a collection of verse by the objectivist poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/apr/29/specificreasonstorememberg\" title=\"\">George Oppen</a>, whose work she discovered as a student on the west coast of America. Here they are at last, she thinks, turning its pages: the words I will say out loud to the woman with whom I hope to spend the rest of my life. The poem in question, <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=28510\" title=\"\">The Hills</a>, which is about Oppen\u2019s relationship with his wife, Mary, shimmers with optimism; it pleases her greatly that its sense of love has to do with aspiration rather than ownership.</p> <p>Oppen was something of a minimalist, his poems sitting \u201clike little insects on the pages\u201d \u2013 a sparseness that is the polar opposite of certain things that make her nervous about weddings. Looking at his work now, though, she wonders if she can\u2019t also deploy him in another way. Before she is married, Shawcross wants to \u201cgo back into the silence\u201d: to try to understand why, as a teenager, she gave up speaking for several months, and what effect, in adulthood, this had on her capacity for intimacy. It isn\u2019t only that as \u201cthe poet of the gaps and caesuras of gaping white space\u201d, Oppen will make for a good companion during such an excavation. There was a time when he, too, fell into silence. Following his first collection in 1934, with its acclamatory preface by Ezra Pound, he did not publish again until 1962.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes silence is empowering; at others, it can be a sign of distress. It often provokes anger and frustration</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This sounds like a good premise for a book, two seeming mysteries to be solved. But what follows hardly lives up to the early billing. Oppen, it turns out, wasn\u2019t so much silent as preoccupied with other things during his own quietness, poetry seeming to be somewhat superfluous in Depression-era America (as a member of the Communist party, moreover, he feared his work being co-opted as propaganda). Shawcross\u2019s wordlessness, meanwhile, was not half so dramatic as it at first sounds, being only partial. Though she declined to join in conversations outside the home, she was always able to answer direct questions, and she spoke to her family quite normally; her old school friends, she reveals, do not remember that she was quiet. Hers sounds like a fairly ordinary sort of reticence, and she works out within the first 40 pages of her book that it was largely the result both of not quite fitting in at her independent school, and of her sense that there were some things she should not talk about in public (her father had been made redundant, causing a \u201cunimaginable\u201d loss of income given that he had \u201ca house in the home counties and four sets of school fees to meet\u201d).</p> <p>Having reached so soon what feels to the reader like a dead end, where she should go? Shawcross initially sets out to investigate the experiences of children who are suffering from the condition known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jun/15/selective-mutism-complex-problem\" title=\"\">selective mutism</a>. She talks to a therapist who believes that for some speech is a phobia like any other, and visits a camp in the US that encourages children to overcome their anxieties in this area in a somewhat brutal manner. After this, however, things grow more unfocused. She interviews Eve Ensler, author of <em>The Vagina Monologues</em>, who empowered women to speak of things they were perhaps previously conditioned to keep quiet about. She looks at the rise of the Samaritans, whose job it is to listen. In Nepal, where she meets victims of the 2015 earthquake, she comes to understand that there are times and places where talking cures may be of no use at all. She goes on not one, but two, Buddhist retreats, and attends a Quaker meeting. She has a cup of tea with a nun who belongs to a silent order.</p> <p>What does she learn in the course of these encounters? Not quite enough, perhaps (one particular strangeness of her book is what a haphazard journalist she seems to be, worrying about her taxi meter when she should be concentrating on the story). Sometimes, it seems, silence is empowering; at others, it can be a sign of distress. It often provokes anger and frustration. I kept waiting for everything to come together: a moment of epiphany or even of some clarity. But this never happened. I don\u2019t want to discount what Shawcross has been through emotionally in her life. Nevertheless, it is uncomfortable to see her moving rather seamlessly on the page from writing about those who have lost everything in an earthquake to the trouble she had coming out, or the death of her grandmother from old age, as if these things are similar. They are not, and I wonder that no editor was moved to point this out. Shawcross can certainly write \u2013 there are some lovely images in <em>Unspeakable</em> \u2013 and she is obviously in possession of a curious and interesting mind.

      "body": "<p>\u201cEnergy\u201d is often a dodging word for theatre critics. It sounds approving but may just mean messy: puppyish, well-intentioned and all over the place. Not when applied to<strong> <a href=\"https://www.youngvic.org/whats-on/jesus-hopped-the-a-train\" title=\"\">Jesus Hopped the \u2018A\u2019 Train</a></strong>. Kate Hewitt\u2019s production of Stephen Adly Guirgis\u2019s play, first put on 18 years ago, roars on to the stage. Its energy is manifold: physical, verbal and emotional. Defiantly spiritual, continually caustic.</p> <p>In a US jail, two male prisoners face up to themselves and to each other. Magda Willi\u2019s design traps them in a glass box on a traverse stage: two banks of spectators are set up to glare confrontationally across the action. One of these men is celebrated for the horrors he has committed, but claims to have found God. He seems to be irradiated with self-knowledge \u2013 but is he? And how far can repentance let anyone off the hook?</p> <p>Oberon KA Adjepong as Lucius \u2013 who can do multiple press-ups and recite the books of the Old Testament backwards \u2013 is a magnificent presence, who does things with his growling voice that make him sound like a prophet: he plunges a syllable down low, then flings the next into the air as a high note, so that for a moment the script is a piece of jazz.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Its final eruption is terrific: so explosive that every seat at the Young Vic vibrates</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Angel (Ukweli Roach), who apparently killed by accident \u2013 though the play asks if there is any such thing as accident \u2013 skitters finely between self-righteousness and being crumpled. The debate between them is not entirely lucid or logical: this is a confrontation of human energy, muddled and vital.

      "bodyText": "\u201cEnergy\u201d is often a dodging word for theatre critics. It sounds approving but may just mean messy: puppyish, well-intentioned and all over the place. Not when applied to Jesus Hopped the \u2018A\u2019 Train. Kate Hewitt\u2019s production of Stephen Adly Guirgis\u2019s play, first put on 18 years ago, roars on to the stage. Its energy is manifold: physical, verbal and emotional. Defiantly spiritual, continually caustic. In a US jail, two male prisoners face up to themselves and to each other. Magda Willi\u2019s design traps them in a glass box on a traverse stage: two banks of spectators are set up to glare confrontationally across the action. One of these men is celebrated for the horrors he has committed, but claims to have found God. He seems to be irradiated with self-knowledge \u2013 but is he? And how far can repentance let anyone off the hook? Oberon KA Adjepong as Lucius \u2013 who can do multiple press-ups and recite the books of the Old Testament backwards \u2013 is a magnificent presence, who does things with his growling voice that make him sound like a prophet: he plunges a syllable down low, then flings the next into the air as a high note, so that for a moment the script is a piece of jazz. Angel (Ukweli Roach), who apparently killed by accident \u2013 though the play asks if there is any such thing as accident \u2013 skitters finely between self-righteousness and being crumpled. The debate between them is not entirely lucid or logical: this is a confrontation of human energy, muddled and vital. Peter Rice\u2019s sound design underlines this too much, with blasts of drums and brass throughout. But its final eruption is terrific: so explosive that every seat at the Young Vic vibrates. More coherent and less dynamic than Guirgis, Anne Washburn\u2019s dramas look at America through the lurid lens of telly and film. Her characters swim in apocalypse and soap opera. She provides penetrating observations but not always vibrant stagings. I have yet to be convinced that the brilliance of The Simpsons required the theatrical exegesis Washburn supplied in Mr Burns, A Post-Electric Play (2012). Her adaptation of The Twilight Zone, which opens next month in the West End, is acute but insufficiently chilling. In Shipwreck, a group of white American liberals pick over their astonishment at what has happened to their country by reaching for the stories that may have primed a nation to elect Trump. The arguments are cogent but the exposition is often laborious. Rupert Goold, the magic dragon of the theatre, puffs excitement into the drama. Miriam Buether\u2019s circular, intense design rivets the attention.

Playing broadly tonal, raga-inspired melody, the orchestra provided context for the soloist\u2019s rhythmic complexities. <em>Peskhar </em>means a composition for tabla. It\u2019s also the name of a figure in the Mughal court. Here two musical traditions worked supportively together, without ever integrating, like a sturdy wooden frame around the intricacies of an Indian miniature. Hussain had a crowd of fans ready to cheer his virtuosity, but many left once they had heard him.

Its sound is unlike any other orchestra, literally because so many of the instruments are technically different, notably horn and oboe. You hear it instantly, but that singularity is not merely to do with reed type or bore size or finely controlled use of vibrato.</p> <p>Witnessing the orchestra in Mahler\u2019s Symphony No 9, a work of harrowing, almost punishing excess, is to hear a body of virtuosos thinking and breathing as one, daring in their variety, horn and piccolo serenading one another like different species of calling birds, second violins grinding out the diabolic scherzo waltz with weight and pliancy, all the strings weaving the sorrowful variations of the last movement as if from flatted gold.

In Birmingham (and at London\u2019s Cadogan Hall, but not elsewhere on the UK tour, where popular western repertoire was played), the centrepiece was Peshkar (2015), a tabla concerto by the maestro Zakir Hussain. Playing broadly tonal, raga-inspired melody, the orchestra provided context for the soloist\u2019s rhythmic complexities. Peskhar means a composition for tabla. It\u2019s also the name of a figure in the Mughal court. Here two musical traditions worked supportively together, without ever integrating, like a sturdy wooden frame around the intricacies of an Indian miniature. Hussain had a crowd of fans ready to cheer his virtuosity, but many left once they had heard him. As the SOI\u2019s brave venture unfolds, we\u2019ll be watching. The Vienna Philharmonic, 177 years old, has the opposite challenge: to keep its tradition, handed down through generations, alive and forward looking. Its sound is unlike any other orchestra, literally because so many of the instruments are technically different, notably horn and oboe. You hear it instantly, but that singularity is not merely to do with reed type or bore size or finely controlled use of vibrato. Witnessing the orchestra in Mahler\u2019s Symphony No 9, a work of harrowing, almost punishing excess, is to hear a body of virtuosos thinking and breathing as one, daring in their variety, horn and piccolo serenading one another like different species of calling birds, second violins grinding out the diabolic scherzo waltz with weight and pliancy, all the strings weaving the sorrowful variations of the last movement as if from flatted gold. The Hungarian conductor Ad\u00e1m Fischer, jabbing, bobbing, writhing, whipping the air, didn\u2019t look the easiest to follow but certainly got results. All that was missing was tenderness. The purity of unaccompanied voices, occasionally joined by lute, singing early Renaissance music in the intimacy of the Globe\u2019s Sam Wanamaker Playhouse is the best kind of aural solace. Members of the Sixteen sang lute songs by Thomas Campion and motets by Cornysh, Lambe and others. It\u2019s part of a Shakespeare\u2019s Globe season on what it means to be \u201cEnglish\u201d. We\u2019re all wondering, now more than ever. Star ratings (out of five) Symphony Orchestra of India \u2605\u2605\u2605 Vienna Philharmonic \u2605\u2605\u2605 The Sixteen \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605",

As it happens, it is an army of automatons conceived and created by tech firms on the coasts and unleashed on middle America, potentially spurring a deepening us versus them mentality. Yang has written: \u201cI am writing from inside the tech bubble to let you know that we are coming for your jobs.\u201d</p> <p>Yang wants to become president so he can do something about it. He asserts that Trump won the election because the country automated away 4m manufacturing jobs in the critical swing states of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri and Iowa.</p> <p>\u201cNow we\u2019re about to do the same thing to millions of retail jobs, call centre jobs, fast food jobs and, most destructively, trucking jobs in the coming years \u2026 When I talked to other mainstream political candidates, no one seemed to want to focus on <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trumps-election-was-fueled-by-social-decay-and-real-suffering-and-its-not-going-away\">the enormity of the reality that\u2019s ahead for America</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Like it or not, self-driving trucks are coming, Yang is certain. Truck driving is the most common job in 29 states in America, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/02/05/382664837/map-the-most-common-job-in-every-state\">according to census data</a>, and a demographic that includes many ex-military servicemen and many Trump voters.</p> <p>Yang, armed with a battery of statistics, says: \u201cThere are 3.5 million truck drivers, 94% male, average age 49, average education high school or one year of college, and they make about $46,000 a year. It\u2019s one of the highest-paying jobs for non-college graduates in the US. It\u2019s a very demanding, punishing job, but it\u2019s also one of the surest ways to a middle-class income for a huge number of men.</p> <p>\u201cOn the other side you have some of the smartest engineers in the country working on automating away that job. The financial incentives to do so are massive: $168bn a year in estimated savings, not just from labour costs but equipment utilisation, fuel efficiency, fewer accidents. So if you foresee that the truck driving jobs are going to start getting automated away in the next five to 10 years, that\u2019s going to have massive ramifications not just for this 3.5m trucker population but also the 5 million-plus Americans who work in truck stops, motels and diners that rely upon the truckers stopping every day.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is the trickle-up economy from people, families and communities. It would actually work, unlike the trickle-down economy which was sold to us</p> <footer> <cite>Andrew Yang</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He goes on: \u201cSo the hollowing out of the interior of the country is going to be amplified many times over by the automation of freight. I was just in Davenport, Iowa, at the country\u2019s largest truck stop, <a href=\"https://iowa80truckstop.com/\">Iowa 80,</a> and they proudly state that 5,000 people stop there every day. So you can imagine what\u2019s going to happen when that number starts to dwindle. It\u2019s going to be disastrous for many Americans and many communities.\u201d</p> <p>In an age when many are tired of celebrity politics, no one could accuse Yang of lacking big ideas. Under his administration, the government would provide <a href=\"http://UBI explainer\">a universal basic income</a> of $1,000 a month, or $12,000 a year, for all US citizens between the ages of 18 and 64, paid for by a new tax on automation. Before you suggest he is mad, Yang contends that Thomas Paine, Martin Luther King, Richard Nixon and Milton Friedman all endorsed similar ideas, and oil-rich Alaska has paid an annual dividend to citizens for the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/13/16997188/alaska-basic-income-permanent-fund-oil-revenue-study\">past 37 years with great success.</a></p> <p>\u201cIf you put $1,000 a month into people\u2019s hands it gets their heads up and it helps children become healthier and stronger and graduate from school at higher rates,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes people mentally healthier and improves relationships, it would reduce domestic violence and hospital visits, it would help empower women to improve their situations if they are in exploitative or abusive jobs or relationships.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/15/trump-2020-message-el-paso-texas-republicans\">Flag-waving and Democrat-bashing: Trump's blueprint to win in 2020</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The question, naturally, is how are you going to pay for it? Yangs wants a change in the tax code so that tech giants such as Amazon and Google pay a value added tax, generating hundreds of billions of dollars. He also believes that it would pump money back into the economy, for example in the form of tutoring and food for children, car repairs, trips to the hardware store, the occasional night out, and create 2m jobs.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the trickle-up economy from people, families and communities. It would actually work, unlike the trickle-down economy which was sold to us,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Yang was born in Schenectady, New York, the son of Taiwanese immigrants; his father generated 69 US patents for GE and IBM over his career. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of being Asian American and there are many Asian Americans who are excited about my candidacy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Yang is fond of referring to \u201cthe numbers\u201d.

As it happens, it is an army of automatons conceived and created by tech firms on the coasts and unleashed on middle America, potentially spurring a deepening us versus them mentality. Yang has written: \u201cI am writing from inside the tech bubble to let you know that we are coming for your jobs.\u201d Yang wants to become president so he can do something about it. He asserts that Trump won the election because the country automated away 4m manufacturing jobs in the critical swing states of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri and Iowa. \u201cNow we\u2019re about to do the same thing to millions of retail jobs, call centre jobs, fast food jobs and, most destructively, trucking jobs in the coming years \u2026 When I talked to other mainstream political candidates, no one seemed to want to focus on the enormity of the reality that\u2019s ahead for America.\u201d Like it or not, self-driving trucks are coming, Yang is certain. Truck driving is the most common job in 29 states in America, according to census data, and a demographic that includes many ex-military servicemen and many Trump voters. Yang, armed with a battery of statistics, says: \u201cThere are 3.5 million truck drivers, 94% male, average age 49, average education high school or one year of college, and they make about $46,000 a year. It\u2019s one of the highest-paying jobs for non-college graduates in the US. It\u2019s a very demanding, punishing job, but it\u2019s also one of the surest ways to a middle-class income for a huge number of men. \u201cOn the other side you have some of the smartest engineers in the country working on automating away that job. The financial incentives to do so are massive: $168bn a year in estimated savings, not just from labour costs but equipment utilisation, fuel efficiency, fewer accidents. So if you foresee that the truck driving jobs are going to start getting automated away in the next five to 10 years, that\u2019s going to have massive ramifications not just for this 3.5m trucker population but also the 5 million-plus Americans who work in truck stops, motels and diners that rely upon the truckers stopping every day. He goes on: \u201cSo the hollowing out of the interior of the country is going to be amplified many times over by the automation of freight. I was just in Davenport, Iowa, at the country\u2019s largest truck stop, Iowa 80, and they proudly state that 5,000 people stop there every day. So you can imagine what\u2019s going to happen when that number starts to dwindle. It\u2019s going to be disastrous for many Americans and many communities.\u201d In an age when many are tired of celebrity politics, no one could accuse Yang of lacking big ideas. Under his administration, the government would provide a universal basic income of $1,000 a month, or $12,000 a year, for all US citizens between the ages of 18 and 64, paid for by a new tax on automation. Before you suggest he is mad, Yang contends that Thomas Paine, Martin Luther King, Richard Nixon and Milton Friedman all endorsed similar ideas, and oil-rich Alaska has paid an annual dividend to citizens for the past 37 years with great success. \u201cIf you put $1,000 a month into people\u2019s hands it gets their heads up and it helps children become healthier and stronger and graduate from school at higher rates,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes people mentally healthier and improves relationships, it would reduce domestic violence and hospital visits, it would help empower women to improve their situations if they are in exploitative or abusive jobs or relationships.\u201d The question, naturally, is how are you going to pay for it? Yangs wants a change in the tax code so that tech giants such as Amazon and Google pay a value added tax, generating hundreds of billions of dollars. He also believes that it would pump money back into the economy, for example in the form of tutoring and food for children, car repairs, trips to the hardware store, the occasional night out, and create 2m jobs. \u201cThis is the trickle-up economy from people, families and communities. It would actually work, unlike the trickle-down economy which was sold to us,\u201d he said. Yang was born in Schenectady, New York, the son of Taiwanese immigrants; his father generated 69 US patents for GE and IBM over his career. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of being Asian American and there are many Asian Americans who are excited about my candidacy,\u201d he said. Yang is fond of referring to \u201cthe numbers\u201d. Dispute them at your peril. He tweeted this week: \u201cSometimes a journalist will say to me: \u2018You\u2019re polling at 1%\u2019 as if it\u2019s a bad thing. I respond: \u2018That\u2019s right. And that\u2019s when most Americans have never heard of me. We are only going to grow from here.\u2019\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s difficult in dance to find a balance between past and present; respecting history while making works live for today. This is particularly delicate when it comes to the three-act classical ballets that represent the height of 19th-century style and give dancers an opportunity to show off, while the bits in between those moments of bravura brilliance can seem dusty and dull. Yet more contemporary works age too; pieces become stale if not refreshed; companies that exist purely to preserve the works of 20th-century masters begin to look like museums.</p> <p>By chance last week, the Royal Ballet and Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch tackled different aspects of the problem, with provocative and interesting results.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/productions/don-quixote-by-carlos-acosta\" title=\"\"><strong>Don Quixote</strong></a>, created for the Bolshoi by Marius Petipa in 1869, has never particularly suited the Royal Ballet. The company\u2019s instincts for naturalistic drama and detailed dancing don\u2019t mesh with a work whose relationship to the Cervantes novel is purely incidental and whose effects are large and flashy. So when Carlos Acosta restaged it for them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/oct/06/don-quixote-royal-ballet-review\" title=\"\">in 2013</a>, he tried to play to their strengths by making the action more realistic and sorting out the tenuous storyline.</p> <p>To an extent he succeeded. In this production, you have at least a chance of understanding that Don Quixote (played with a gentle nobility by <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/christopher-saunders\" title=\"\">Christopher Saunders</a>) is entranced by a chivalric vision, and his entanglement with the heroine, Kitri, and her lover, Basilio, has some relationship to this dream. Other decisions are less adept. Getting the crowd to act at every available moment \u2013 and sometimes to shout \u2013 generates billowing action and sudden noise that are potentially distracting. Designer <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/tim-hatley\" title=\"\">Tim Hatley</a> adds to the confusion by providing a set where houses and windmills actually move, altering the perspective in risible ways.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s difficult in dance to find a balance between past and present; respecting history while making works live for today. This is particularly delicate when it comes to the three-act classical ballets that represent the height of 19th-century style and give dancers an opportunity to show off, while the bits in between those moments of bravura brilliance can seem dusty and dull. Yet more contemporary works age too; pieces become stale if not refreshed; companies that exist purely to preserve the works of 20th-century masters begin to look like museums. By chance last week, the Royal Ballet and Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch tackled different aspects of the problem, with provocative and interesting results. Don Quixote, created for the Bolshoi by Marius Petipa in 1869, has never particularly suited the Royal Ballet. The company\u2019s instincts for naturalistic drama and detailed dancing don\u2019t mesh with a work whose relationship to the Cervantes novel is purely incidental and whose effects are large and flashy. So when Carlos Acosta restaged it for them in 2013, he tried to play to their strengths by making the action more realistic and sorting out the tenuous storyline. To an extent he succeeded. In this production, you have at least a chance of understanding that Don Quixote (played with a gentle nobility by Christopher Saunders) is entranced by a chivalric vision, and his entanglement with the heroine, Kitri, and her lover, Basilio, has some relationship to this dream. Other decisions are less adept. Getting the crowd to act at every available moment \u2013 and sometimes to shout \u2013 generates billowing action and sudden noise that are potentially distracting. Designer Tim Hatley adds to the confusion by providing a set where houses and windmills actually move, altering the perspective in risible ways. Someone should nail them to the ground and be done with it. None of this matters much, however, when the dancing is as fine as when Marianela Nu\u00f1ez is playing Kitri and Vadim Muntagirov is Basilio. Nu\u00f1ez endows the heroine with warmth, an all-embracing love of life and a delicate kindness. As for her dancing, it is simply dazzling, whether she\u2019s flying through the air, spinning through turns, or endowing the vision scene with an expansive grace. Muntagirov\u2019s variations \u2013 including one where he seemed to pause in the air while doing the splits \u2013 also have the adamantine sparkle of a pure dancer at the top of his game, and he embellishes this with his tender partnering, and a mischievous sense of humour. As if inspired by such dancing, the entire cast blazed. Meanwhile, over at Sadler\u2019s Wells, the Greek choreographer Dimitris Papaioannou (best known to a wider audience as the creator of the Athens Olympics opening ceremony) took on the virtually impossible task of becoming the first choreographer to create a new work for Tanztheater Wuppertal since the death of its founder, Pina Bausch in 2009. Papaioannou knew Bausch and has fashioned Since She as a loving homage, opening with an explicit tribute where the dancers walk gingerly across the stage on a bridge of chairs lifted from the set of Caf\u00e9 M\u00fcller, the first Bausch work he saw. Then a woman in a fur coat (Ruth Amarante) appears at the top of a precipitous mountain of dark foam at the back of the stage; it\u2019s an image straight out of Viktor, where the dancers perform in the pit of a grave. For the first 20 minutes or so, Since She feels like an accumulation of Bausch-light images, a series of dreamlike vignettes that recall her without ever penetrating the dark mysteries of the human soul in the way that she did. But as Papaioannou\u2019s own iconography begins to assert itself, its power and interest increases, creating a series of striking images, of strange creatures emerging from the shadows.

I would hope that the Conservatives that I know will take a no-deal off the table.\u201d</p> \n<p>Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark jointly wrote a newspaper article warning that they would join MPs pushing for an extension to article 50 if there is no significant progress this week. Senior Tories believe that the resignations of Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston have made it too dangerous to sack ministers willing to vote for a Brexit delay.</p> \n<p>MPs are due to vote on the contentious plan to delay Brexit \u2013 proposed by Oliver Letwin, the former Tory cabinet minister, and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee \u2013 on Wednesday. It would oblige the government to ask for a delay if a deal has not been sealed by the middle of March. Britain is due to leave the EU at the end of next month.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/feb/24/oliver-letwin-article-50-extension-last-chance-historic\">In an article for the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/feb/24/oliver-letwin-article-50-extension-last-chance-historic\">Observer</a></em>, Letwin states that a vote for his plan would open the door to parliament taking control of the Brexit process. \u201cIf we don\u2019t act now, the UK will sleepwalk out of the EU in just over 30 days with no deal whatsoever,\u201d he writes. \u201cMany of us on the Conservative benches have already voted for the prime minister\u2019s deal once. We are more than prepared to do so again next week and in coming weeks. But we have watched with increasing dismay as the government has shuffled, bit by bit, towards a cliff edge.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe prospect of falling by mistake into a no-deal Brexit, simply because we have failed to create an opportunity for cross-party consensus to emerge, would be a tragic and historic mistake.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, there are also huge dangers for No 10 in allowing ministers to back the move. One cabinet minister said such a decision would \u201clook like the government failing to take responsibility for delivering Brexit on time\u201d, and cause a revolt among Tory Brexiters.</p> \n<p>In a sign of growing grassroots pressure on MPs, Tory activists gathering for the party\u2019s national convention on Saturday passed a motion opposing any attempt to delay Britain\u2019s EU exit. \u201cThe national convention supports the commitments the prime minister has made to the country to honour the European Union referendum result of 2016 so that having triggered article 50 we will leave the European Union on 29 March 2019,\u201d it states.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5480f484-cbb1-44bf-a9b9-c2b8675db23d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8CA_KpErcls?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cAnother referendum, a delay beyond the European elections, taking no-deal off the table or not leaving at all would betray the 2016 people\u2019s vote and damage democracy and our party for a generation.\u201d</p> \n<p>In an attempt to calm divisions, the prime minister told the convention that the Tories were not \u201ca party of purges and retribution\u201d and called for an end of attempts to deselect MPs over Brexit.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhile I know it hurts to lose a fellow Conservative, our reaction has been the right one,\u201d she said. \u201cTo listen to their reasons, even if we disagree with them. To explain politely where we think they\u2019re wrong. To respect the sincerity of their decision, even if we regret it.\u201d</p> \n<p>She also told her audience that she would not allow the referendum vote to leave the EU to be frustrated. \u201cOur focus to deliver Brexit must be absolute,\u201d she told the behind-closed-doors meeting, according to extracts released by No 10.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe must not, and I will not, frustrate what was the largest democratic exercise in this country\u2019s history.

It comes after three Tory MPs resigned from the party last week, partly in protest at May\u2019s handling of Brexit, while a trio of cabinet ministers took the highly unusual step of publicly signalling they could vote to delay withdrawal from the EU. Lord Heseltine, the former Tory deputy prime minister, warned more resignations would happen unless MPs were allowed to tackle the \u201cmost catastrophic aspect of Brexit\u201d and block a no-deal outcome. \u201cCertainly my advice would be to those who have doubts, stay and fight,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t acquiesce. I would hope that the Conservatives that I know will take a no-deal off the table.\u201d Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark jointly wrote a newspaper article warning that they would join MPs pushing for an extension to article 50 if there is no significant progress this week. Senior Tories believe that the resignations of Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston have made it too dangerous to sack ministers willing to vote for a Brexit delay. MPs are due to vote on the contentious plan to delay Brexit \u2013 proposed by Oliver Letwin, the former Tory cabinet minister, and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee \u2013 on Wednesday. It would oblige the government to ask for a delay if a deal has not been sealed by the middle of March. Britain is due to leave the EU at the end of next month. In an article for the Observer, Letwin states that a vote for his plan would open the door to parliament taking control of the Brexit process. \u201cIf we don\u2019t act now, the UK will sleepwalk out of the EU in just over 30 days with no deal whatsoever,\u201d he writes. \u201cMany of us on the Conservative benches have already voted for the prime minister\u2019s deal once. We are more than prepared to do so again next week and in coming weeks. But we have watched with increasing dismay as the government has shuffled, bit by bit, towards a cliff edge. \u201cThe prospect of falling by mistake into a no-deal Brexit, simply because we have failed to create an opportunity for cross-party consensus to emerge, would be a tragic and historic mistake.\u201d However, there are also huge dangers for No 10 in allowing ministers to back the move. One cabinet minister said such a decision would \u201clook like the government failing to take responsibility for delivering Brexit on time\u201d, and cause a revolt among Tory Brexiters. In a sign of growing grassroots pressure on MPs, Tory activists gathering for the party\u2019s national convention on Saturday passed a motion opposing any attempt to delay Britain\u2019s EU exit. \u201cThe national convention supports the commitments the prime minister has made to the country to honour the European Union referendum result of 2016 so that having triggered article 50 we will leave the European Union on 29 March 2019,\u201d it states. \u201cAnother referendum, a delay beyond the European elections, taking no-deal off the table or not leaving at all would betray the 2016 people\u2019s vote and damage democracy and our party for a generation.\u201d In an attempt to calm divisions, the prime minister told the convention that the Tories were not \u201ca party of purges and retribution\u201d and called for an end of attempts to deselect MPs over Brexit. \u201cWhile I know it hurts to lose a fellow Conservative, our reaction has been the right one,\u201d she said. \u201cTo listen to their reasons, even if we disagree with them. To explain politely where we think they\u2019re wrong. To respect the sincerity of their decision, even if we regret it.\u201d She also told her audience that she would not allow the referendum vote to leave the EU to be frustrated. \u201cOur focus to deliver Brexit must be absolute,\u201d she told the behind-closed-doors meeting, according to extracts released by No 10. \u201cWe must not, and I will not, frustrate what was the largest democratic exercise in this country\u2019s history. In the very final stages of this process, the worst thing we could do is lose our focus.\u201d May will be at an EU-Middle East summit on Sunday to hold talks with figures including the European council president, Donald Tusk, and Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, as she battles to secure a revised deal acceptable to the right of her party.",

But it is now clear many members of the ERG would actually prefer us to leave the EU without a deal, so any attempt to rely on them to carry her deal through is doomed to fail. So there is only one path open to those of us who seek to find some form of reasonable and orderly Brexit. We need to initiate a cross-party process to find a sensible Brexit compromise that a majority of MPs from political parties across the House of Commons would be willing to support and see through. In order to do that, we first need to secure the parliamentary time and space required to make it happen. This week parliament will have, for the last time, a chance to set this process in train. The prospect of falling by mistake into a no-deal Brexit, simply because we have failed to create an opportunity for cross-party consensus to emerge, would be a tragic and historic mistake. Of course we know that our intentions may be misconstrued and our motives maligned. But we are determined to do what we can to avert disaster, rather than sit on our hands and watch a tragedy unfold as if we had no responsibility for it.",

He had a theory, too, why some women \u2013 Marilyn Monroe, Brigitte Bardot and Grace Kelly here \u2013 jumped with bent knees. \u201cWhen an adult woman jumps with bent knees like a little girl, it is not a mere coincidence,\u201d Haslam suggested. \u201cIt shows that, at the moment of the jump, she has become again a little girl.\u201d His 1955 portrait of Kelly is included in an exhibition from the Magnum archive devoted to The Body Observed. When he first published it, Kelly sent him a telegram to make sure that he noted \u201cthat when she had jumped, she was not yet a princess\u201d. The Body Observed runs at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts at the University of East Anglia, Norwich, 23 March to 30 June",

But none prompted as loud an industry backlash as their proposal to cut a handful of lower-profile awards from the live broadcast, presenting them in ad breaks. Among those slated for the chop: best live action short.</p> \n<p>Industry titans from Martin Scorsese to Spike Lee voiced their displeasure with the idea, and the Academy sheepishly reversed course: all 24 Oscar categories, including the live action, animated and documentary short prizes, will survive on the broadcast another year. It would have been a shame to lose them: for most casual viewers, those few minutes at the Oscars are probably the most they\u2019ll hear about short cinema all year. (Not to mention the fact that they reliably offer far higher odds of seeing female film-makers rewarded on stage than the feature categories.) Short film awards may be comparatively unglamorous, but they encourage public interest in a form that otherwise gets little exposure or distribution in cinemas. Now that <a href=\"https://shorts.tv/theoscarshorts/\" title=\"\">ShortsTV</a> makes all the nominees available to view online through Amazon Video, these awards no longer feel so obscure. You may not have gone out to see every film up for best picture, but in one or two streaming sessions, you can be up to speed with all three short fields.</p> \n<p>They won\u2019t, admittedly, make for the most cheerful evening\u2019s viewing: \u201ckids in grievous peril\u201d is the overwhelming theme of this year\u2019s live action race, expanding into more general parent-child anguish for the animated selections. The short doc category isn\u2019t a barrel of laughs either, though that\u2019s generally to be expected.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/234003945\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/234003945?app_id=122963&dnt=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/234003945\">Watch the trailer for Weekends.</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>More of a letdown is the uneven quality of the live action shorts, too many of which feel like sleek stunts: indeed, the likely frontrunner, Guy Nattiv\u2019s rather blunt racial parable <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1JOhK71CLI\" title=\"\">Skin</a></strong>, is such a blatant calling card that it\u2019s already been expanded into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/10/skin-review-jamie-bell-swaps-nazism-for-love-in-moral-tale-of-far-right\" title=\"\">feature starring Jamie Bell</a>. Controversy has circled the Irish nominee <strong>Detainment</strong>, a reconstructive exercise built around recordings from the police questioning of Jamie Bulger\u2019s young killers. Bulger\u2019s family has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/08/james-bulger-detainment-oscars-shortlist-removal\" title=\"\">petitioned against the film</a>, prompting tabloid-enabled rumours that it\u2019s a more grisly reenactment. It\u2019s nothing so crass, though it does feel a bit hollow. More impressive is Canadian film-maker Jeremy Comte\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/249724139\" title=\"\">Fauve</a></strong>, an eerie, boys-against-nature study that pulls off the most shivery cinematic coups in the category. I\u2019ll be rooting for it.</p> \n<p>The animated field is stronger, largely thanks to the presence of one mini-masterwork.

      "bodyText": "Amid a succession of PR disasters \u2013 such as nominating Bryan Singer\u2019s Bohemian Rhapsody for a slew of awards after sexual abuse allegations, which he categorically denies, were made against the director; or hiring as host the comedian Kevin Hart, who then stepped down after an outcry over his perceived homophobic comments and tweets \u2013 the Oscars have done something to displease just about every film fan this year. But none prompted as loud an industry backlash as their proposal to cut a handful of lower-profile awards from the live broadcast, presenting them in ad breaks. Among those slated for the chop: best live action short. Industry titans from Martin Scorsese to Spike Lee voiced their displeasure with the idea, and the Academy sheepishly reversed course: all 24 Oscar categories, including the live action, animated and documentary short prizes, will survive on the broadcast another year. It would have been a shame to lose them: for most casual viewers, those few minutes at the Oscars are probably the most they\u2019ll hear about short cinema all year. (Not to mention the fact that they reliably offer far higher odds of seeing female film-makers rewarded on stage than the feature categories.) Short film awards may be comparatively unglamorous, but they encourage public interest in a form that otherwise gets little exposure or distribution in cinemas. Now that ShortsTV makes all the nominees available to view online through Amazon Video, these awards no longer feel so obscure. You may not have gone out to see every film up for best picture, but in one or two streaming sessions, you can be up to speed with all three short fields. They won\u2019t, admittedly, make for the most cheerful evening\u2019s viewing: \u201ckids in grievous peril\u201d is the overwhelming theme of this year\u2019s live action race, expanding into more general parent-child anguish for the animated selections. The short doc category isn\u2019t a barrel of laughs either, though that\u2019s generally to be expected. More of a letdown is the uneven quality of the live action shorts, too many of which feel like sleek stunts: indeed, the likely frontrunner, Guy Nattiv\u2019s rather blunt racial parable Skin, is such a blatant calling card that it\u2019s already been expanded into a feature starring Jamie Bell. Controversy has circled the Irish nominee Detainment, a reconstructive exercise built around recordings from the police questioning of Jamie Bulger\u2019s young killers. Bulger\u2019s family has petitioned against the film, prompting tabloid-enabled rumours that it\u2019s a more grisly reenactment. It\u2019s nothing so crass, though it does feel a bit hollow. More impressive is Canadian film-maker Jeremy Comte\u2019s Fauve, an eerie, boys-against-nature study that pulls off the most shivery cinematic coups in the category. I\u2019ll be rooting for it. The animated field is stronger, largely thanks to the presence of one mini-masterwork. Trevor Jimenez, another Canadian, drew on his own childhood for Weekends, a brilliantly designed, heartache-heavy study of a young boy shuffling between the separate worlds of his divorced parents. It\u2019s a simple, familiar concept made freshly haunting and mysterious by its stylised, child\u2019s-eye perspective. I\u2019ll be disappointed if it loses to its amiable but slighter competition: Pixar\u2019s dumpling-as-baby whimsy trip Bao is just a little too cute, while Animal Behaviour, from Bob and Margaret creators David Fine and Alison Snowden, is a jaunty, anthropomorphic throwaway. Finally, in the documentary field, regular Guardian and Observer readers may already be familiar with Black Sheep, our company\u2019s own potent study of a teen taking disturbing measures to shield himself from council estate racism. It might well be the best of its class. Still, with Marshall Curry\u2019s remarkable six-minute experiment A Night at the Garden \u2013 craftily assembled from archive footage of a 1939 Nazi rally in New York, with chillingly timely political undertones \u2013 also in the running, this is the category that lingers longest in the mind. New to streaming &amp; DVD this week Central Airport THF (Mubi, PG) Never released in cinemas, Karim A\u00efnouz\u2019s keen-eyed social-architectural portrait of Berlin\u2019s Tempelhof airport, now repurposed as a mass refugee shelter, was one of last year\u2019s great documentaries.

As far as his personal life goes, he is an Englishman of a kind most people are familiar with, which I\u2019ve always suspected is part of his appeal: anyone who has been on a walking holiday, to a lower league football ground or to an allotment has met someone a great deal like Corbyn.</p> <p>Nonetheless, he is the leader of a movement that has utterly transformed the Labour party and one way or the other will do the same to British politics, so several writers have tried their hand at a study of Corbyn\u2019s life: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/04/comrade-corbyn-a-very-unlikely-coup-by-rosa-prince-review\" title=\"\">Rosa Prince\u2019s meticulously researched straight biography </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/04/comrade-corbyn-a-very-unlikely-coup-by-rosa-prince-review\" title=\"\">Comrade Corbyn</a></em>, Alex Nunns\u2019s impeccably well-connected inside account of his 2015 leadership campaign, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/candidate-560896.html\" title=\"\">The Candidate</a></em>, and <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/corbyn-520129.html\" title=\"\">Richard Seymour\u2019s critical left analysis</a> <em>Corbyn: </em><em>The Strange Rebirth of Radical Politics</em>.

Those mistakes make this a double failure. As a biography, it tells us nothing we don\u2019t already know and gets things wrong. As a hatchet job, it is a dismal failure that condemns Corbyn\u2019s decision to skip a meaningless Arsenal match with equal intensity as it does his failure to tackle antisemitism in the Labour ranks. Its only value is as a gift to send to an enemy \u2013 and if Tom Bower had confined the readership of this book to Corbyn alone, I for one would be better off.

      "body": "<p>When Honda insisted last week that Brexit was not a factor in the closure of its Swindon plant \u2013 a decision that threatens at least 7,000 jobs \u2013 a few eyebrows were raised. The claim did not seem in accord with its previous warnings: that Brexit would be a prelude to disaster. Surely it was now the company\u2019s civic duty to the people of Swindon to give more thought to the part played by EU withdrawal?</p> <p>Proponents of Brexit, not least the prime minister, immediately leapt on the company\u2019s comments in an effort to head off a Remainer backlash. If Honda was saying it, you had to take them at their word. Since then, after the <em>Guardian</em> presented the Japanese carmaker with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/21/honda-european-chief-outlined-no-deal-brexit-concerns-in-2018\" title=\"\">details of a doom-laden Brexit briefing it gave Swindonites in September last year</a>, the company has subtly altered its rhetoric.</p> <p>It claimed that \u201cno one single event\u201d was responsible \u2013 albeit only once the fuss had died down and the spotlight had shifted. It was a small but noticeable difference in tone. It is true, of course, that there are other important factors at play, some almost certainly more influential than Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU. They include a global car capacity glut, a free-trade deal between Japan and the EU that makes production in Honda\u2019s domestic market easier, and the need to invest heavily in electric vehicles.</p> <p>On that last issue, the UK isn\u2019t very attractive, not necessarily because of Brexit but because, say pundits, our industrial strategy is a mess.</p> <p>\u201cHonda says the UK isn\u2019t an attractive place to make electric cars,\u201d said Professor David Bailey of Aston Business School. \u201cGovernment policy has been all over the place, frankly. The chancellor has cut the subsidy for electric cars. Last year Theresa May gave a speech in Birmingham about encouraging electric vehicle production. As she was speaking, I couldn\u2019t find anywhere in the city to plug in my Nissan Leaf.\u201d</p> <p>With the road ahead looking increasingly long, winding and bumpy, fears are growing that Swindon is just one domino in a chain. Jaguar Land Rover, wrestling with slumping diesel sales, limp Chinese demand and, yes, Brexit, has already cut jobs. Nissan has said it will not be making its new X-Trail in Sunderland.</p> <p>This week, French auto giant Groupe PSA \u2013 the firm behind Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn \u2013 will report full-year results. It also owns Vauxhall, whose plant at Ellesmere Port has been the centre of speculation for some time. A decision on its future is pending and, while PSA may not make an announcement this week, industry observers will be listening intently to the mood music.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t just Ellesmere Port. Fears are growing about possible reductions at facilities such as Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s Castle Bromwich site and the Toyota plant at Burnaston in Derbyshire, which operates with some of the same realities as compatriot Honda.</p> <p>Later this week, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders will give its latest update on manufacturing, a timely reminder of the health of the sector and what there is to lose. The SMMT has been a Cassandra-esque voice on Brexit, particularly a no-deal scenario.</p> <p>Industry observers are tearing their hair out. Ian Henry of consultancy AutoAnalysis said: \u201cIf the UK was in the EU, it\u2019s my personal view that Nissan would have made the X-Trail or some other vehicle in the UK and that Honda would have retained a plant here. The fact that we\u2019re going to be outside it and the government has failed to provide clarity, despite the Japanese asking for it the day after Brexit, just annoys them.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Honda insisted last week that Brexit was not a factor in the closure of its Swindon plant \u2013 a decision that threatens at least 7,000 jobs \u2013 a few eyebrows were raised. The claim did not seem in accord with its previous warnings: that Brexit would be a prelude to disaster. Surely it was now the company\u2019s civic duty to the people of Swindon to give more thought to the part played by EU withdrawal? Proponents of Brexit, not least the prime minister, immediately leapt on the company\u2019s comments in an effort to head off a Remainer backlash. If Honda was saying it, you had to take them at their word. Since then, after the Guardian presented the Japanese carmaker with details of a doom-laden Brexit briefing it gave Swindonites in September last year, the company has subtly altered its rhetoric. It claimed that \u201cno one single event\u201d was responsible \u2013 albeit only once the fuss had died down and the spotlight had shifted. It was a small but noticeable difference in tone. It is true, of course, that there are other important factors at play, some almost certainly more influential than Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU. They include a global car capacity glut, a free-trade deal between Japan and the EU that makes production in Honda\u2019s domestic market easier, and the need to invest heavily in electric vehicles. On that last issue, the UK isn\u2019t very attractive, not necessarily because of Brexit but because, say pundits, our industrial strategy is a mess. \u201cHonda says the UK isn\u2019t an attractive place to make electric cars,\u201d said Professor David Bailey of Aston Business School. \u201cGovernment policy has been all over the place, frankly. The chancellor has cut the subsidy for electric cars. Last year Theresa May gave a speech in Birmingham about encouraging electric vehicle production. As she was speaking, I couldn\u2019t find anywhere in the city to plug in my Nissan Leaf.\u201d With the road ahead looking increasingly long, winding and bumpy, fears are growing that Swindon is just one domino in a chain. Jaguar Land Rover, wrestling with slumping diesel sales, limp Chinese demand and, yes, Brexit, has already cut jobs. Nissan has said it will not be making its new X-Trail in Sunderland. This week, French auto giant Groupe PSA \u2013 the firm behind Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn \u2013 will report full-year results. It also owns Vauxhall, whose plant at Ellesmere Port has been the centre of speculation for some time. A decision on its future is pending and, while PSA may not make an announcement this week, industry observers will be listening intently to the mood music. It isn\u2019t just Ellesmere Port. Fears are growing about possible reductions at facilities such as Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s Castle Bromwich site and the Toyota plant at Burnaston in Derbyshire, which operates with some of the same realities as compatriot Honda. Later this week, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders will give its latest update on manufacturing, a timely reminder of the health of the sector and what there is to lose. The SMMT has been a Cassandra-esque voice on Brexit, particularly a no-deal scenario. Industry observers are tearing their hair out. Ian Henry of consultancy AutoAnalysis said: \u201cIf the UK was in the EU, it\u2019s my personal view that Nissan would have made the X-Trail or some other vehicle in the UK and that Honda would have retained a plant here. The fact that we\u2019re going to be outside it and the government has failed to provide clarity, despite the Japanese asking for it the day after Brexit, just annoys them.\u201d",

Today, on the eve of <a href=\"http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/en/get-involved/current-campaigns/fairtrade-fortnight\" title=\"\">Fairtrade Fortnight</a>, the fact that most supermarkets have moved away from the standards developed by the Fairtrade Foundation is worrying.</p> <p>While some grocery chains have sought the foundation\u2019s stamp of approval, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jun/24/fairtrade-crashing-down-sainsburys-tesco-tea-growers-nairobi\" title=\"\">many have gone their own way</a>. This means most consumers have little sense of which organisation is doing what to protect the wages and rights of developing world workers. Over the next two weeks, the foundation plans to focus its publicity efforts on cocoa farmers in west Africa and the way the Fairtrade mark can improve their lives.</p> <p>Later this year, the base price of Fairtrade cocoa will increase by 20% from $2,000 a tonne to $2,400. The premium farmers put aside for community projects will also rise by 20%, from $200 to $240. This is great news for the farmers who are part of the scheme \u2013 and the higher price is easily within the pockets of chocolate lovers in the rich west.</p> <p>It is a premium on today\u2019s open market price, which stands at around $2,260 a tonne, and protects farmers from the drops in value that hit the industry in 2017, when it dipped below $2,000.</p> <p>Yet the focus on cocoa reveals the limits of the Fairtrade system, which was once going to provide a popular alternative to most goods sold on the high street. There are standards for everything from cotton to gold and flowers, but such products are usually only available at specialist providers or the Co-op.</p> <p>The foundation has tried to persuade some bulk buyers to buy marked goods only, and has had some success. For instance, Transport for London has made sure that the safety vests it provides to staff are made of Fairtrade cotton.</p> <p>But more local authorities, government agencies and corporations need to follow this lead, ensuring that when they place orders in the thousands, it is always for a Fairtrade product.</p> <p>Big businesses, with their large personnel departments, have the resources to explain to their workers why Fairtrade matters when they buy stuff, and what it means for those people at the other end of the production process.</p> <p>But in other sectors, it is left to the Fairtrade Foundation to publicise its efforts and achievements \u2013 with the help of its most active members, such as Divine Chocolate.</p> <p>That is a sad situation. After the great financial crash of 2008, a commodity boom that lasted from 2013 to 2017 turned into a slump that has robbed farmers and developing world governments of vital cash. Just as they were managing to stabilise their finances and set aside money to invest, the world price tumbled and wiped out their profit. Fairtrade practices protect farmers from this sort of setback and allow them to plan for the future.</p> <p>Of course they have their critics. These are most mostly from the US \u2013 people who favour unfettered markets and seek to undermine the Fairtrade ideal, saying it is a form of protectionism that dampens innovation and ultimately ruins farms.</p> <p>Theirs is an almost religious adherence to the free market that discounts the gains in stability and security that Fairtrade provides, and the scope of the community premium to promote universal education and the rights of women.</p> <p>But without large employers making strides to adopt the standardised and transparent Fairtrade practices put forward by the foundation, it will be left to consumers to drive the project forward.</p> <h2>Sainsbury\u2019s Asda merger is toast, but investors are still hungry</h2> <p>In a letter sent last May to Rachel Reeves, chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, Sainsbury\u2019s boss Mike Coupe set out why the grocer needed to merge with rival Asda. Discounters Aldi and Lidl \u201cnow set the value benchmark\u201d on food, he conceded. That meant Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda needed to get together to compete better. \u201cIn this fast-moving environment, standing still is not an option,\u201d he warned.</p> <p>Well, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/20/sainsburys-asda-supermarket-merger-cma-competition\" title=\"\">competition watchdog\u2019s preliminary verdict last week</a>, it looks like Coupe will be standing very still indeed.</p> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority said Coupe\u2019s merger would mean higher prices, less choice, poorer quality, higher petrol prices and less competition at local and national levels. It could just block the deal, it said. Or it could allow it \u2013 so long as a (very large) number of stores were sold to a single buyer. It could also order them to sell off the Sainsbury\u2019s or Asda brand names.</p> <p>Coupe, almost spitting with anger, suggested he might take that verdict to a judicial review. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/20/sainsburys-must-accept-its-asda-merger-has-been-canned\" title=\"\">But the consensus is his merger plan is toast.</a> He needs another plan, fast.</p> <p>When the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/28/sainsburys-and-asda-in-shock-talks-over-10bn-merger-deal\" title=\"\">merger deal was unveiled last spring</a>, Sainsbury\u2019s looked the stronger of the two grocers, but Asda has performed better than Sainsbury\u2019s since then. Analysts reckon that if Walmart \u2013 Asda\u2019s owner \u2013 wants shot of the chain, a private equity buyer could emerge. Supermarkets appeal to private equity houses because they generate lots of cash.</p> <p>If Coupe can\u2019t come up with a new big idea, shareholders might decide they need new leadership \u2013 which wouldn\u2019t be ideal timing with long-serving chairman David Tyler stepping down in March.</p> <p>Or maybe this will be the moment when we discover whether Amazon is serious about a bid for a UK grocery business?</p> <h2>Flawed business model gives Purple Bricks a case of the blues</h2> <p>Traditional estate agents are gleeful over the travails of Purple Bricks, the online agency whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/21/purplebricks-shares-plunge-on-lower-revenue-forecasts\" title=\"\">share price plunged by 40%</a> at one point last week, as revenue forecasts were slashed and its UK and US bosses departed.</p> <p>Last Friday, industry news site <a href=\"https://www.estateagenttoday.co.uk/breaking-news/2019/2/game-over-for-online-agents-they-fail-to-break-through-5-market-share\" title=\"\">Estate Agent Today</a> added to its woes by publishing <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/real-state-online-estate-agency-sector-2019-gavin-brazg/\" title=\"\">figures</a> showing that of the 86,736 UK properties listed for sale between 7 and 21 February, just 4,085, or less than 5%, were with online agents. </p> <p>Purple Bricks is dominant, accounting for 71.8% of new listing for the online sector, but why, despite its multimillion-pound advertising campaign, is it not more popular?</p> <p>Maybe its business model is fundamentally flawed. To sell through Purple Bricks, sellers have to pay an upfront fee of \u00a3899. If the property doesn\u2019t sell, they get nothing for their money.

      "bodyText": "When, in 2017, Sainsbury\u2019s announced that it was planning to develop its own \u201cfairly traded\u201d mark, more than 100,000 people signed a petition condemning the move. Today, on the eve of Fairtrade Fortnight, the fact that most supermarkets have moved away from the standards developed by the Fairtrade Foundation is worrying. While some grocery chains have sought the foundation\u2019s stamp of approval, many have gone their own way. This means most consumers have little sense of which organisation is doing what to protect the wages and rights of developing world workers. Over the next two weeks, the foundation plans to focus its publicity efforts on cocoa farmers in west Africa and the way the Fairtrade mark can improve their lives. Later this year, the base price of Fairtrade cocoa will increase by 20% from $2,000 a tonne to $2,400. The premium farmers put aside for community projects will also rise by 20%, from $200 to $240. This is great news for the farmers who are part of the scheme \u2013 and the higher price is easily within the pockets of chocolate lovers in the rich west. It is a premium on today\u2019s open market price, which stands at around $2,260 a tonne, and protects farmers from the drops in value that hit the industry in 2017, when it dipped below $2,000. Yet the focus on cocoa reveals the limits of the Fairtrade system, which was once going to provide a popular alternative to most goods sold on the high street. There are standards for everything from cotton to gold and flowers, but such products are usually only available at specialist providers or the Co-op. The foundation has tried to persuade some bulk buyers to buy marked goods only, and has had some success. For instance, Transport for London has made sure that the safety vests it provides to staff are made of Fairtrade cotton. But more local authorities, government agencies and corporations need to follow this lead, ensuring that when they place orders in the thousands, it is always for a Fairtrade product. Big businesses, with their large personnel departments, have the resources to explain to their workers why Fairtrade matters when they buy stuff, and what it means for those people at the other end of the production process. But in other sectors, it is left to the Fairtrade Foundation to publicise its efforts and achievements \u2013 with the help of its most active members, such as Divine Chocolate. That is a sad situation. After the great financial crash of 2008, a commodity boom that lasted from 2013 to 2017 turned into a slump that has robbed farmers and developing world governments of vital cash. Just as they were managing to stabilise their finances and set aside money to invest, the world price tumbled and wiped out their profit. Fairtrade practices protect farmers from this sort of setback and allow them to plan for the future. Of course they have their critics. These are most mostly from the US \u2013 people who favour unfettered markets and seek to undermine the Fairtrade ideal, saying it is a form of protectionism that dampens innovation and ultimately ruins farms. Theirs is an almost religious adherence to the free market that discounts the gains in stability and security that Fairtrade provides, and the scope of the community premium to promote universal education and the rights of women. But without large employers making strides to adopt the standardised and transparent Fairtrade practices put forward by the foundation, it will be left to consumers to drive the project forward. Sainsbury\u2019s Asda merger is toast, but investors are still hungry In a letter sent last May to Rachel Reeves, chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, Sainsbury\u2019s boss Mike Coupe set out why the grocer needed to merge with rival Asda. Discounters Aldi and Lidl \u201cnow set the value benchmark\u201d on food, he conceded. That meant Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda needed to get together to compete better. \u201cIn this fast-moving environment, standing still is not an option,\u201d he warned. Well, after the competition watchdog\u2019s preliminary verdict last week, it looks like Coupe will be standing very still indeed. The Competition and Markets Authority said Coupe\u2019s merger would mean higher prices, less choice, poorer quality, higher petrol prices and less competition at local and national levels. It could just block the deal, it said. Or it could allow it \u2013 so long as a (very large) number of stores were sold to a single buyer. It could also order them to sell off the Sainsbury\u2019s or Asda brand names. Coupe, almost spitting with anger, suggested he might take that verdict to a judicial review. But the consensus is his merger plan is toast. He needs another plan, fast. When the merger deal was unveiled last spring, Sainsbury\u2019s looked the stronger of the two grocers, but Asda has performed better than Sainsbury\u2019s since then. Analysts reckon that if Walmart \u2013 Asda\u2019s owner \u2013 wants shot of the chain, a private equity buyer could emerge. Supermarkets appeal to private equity houses because they generate lots of cash. If Coupe can\u2019t come up with a new big idea, shareholders might decide they need new leadership \u2013 which wouldn\u2019t be ideal timing with long-serving chairman David Tyler stepping down in March. Or maybe this will be the moment when we discover whether Amazon is serious about a bid for a UK grocery business? Flawed business model gives Purple Bricks a case of the blues Traditional estate agents are gleeful over the travails of Purple Bricks, the online agency whose share price plunged by 40% at one point last week, as revenue forecasts were slashed and its UK and US bosses departed. Last Friday, industry news site Estate Agent Today added to its woes by publishing figures showing that of the 86,736 UK properties listed for sale between 7 and 21 February, just 4,085, or less than 5%, were with online agents. Purple Bricks is dominant, accounting for 71.8% of new listing for the online sector, but why, despite its multimillion-pound advertising campaign, is it not more popular? Maybe its business model is fundamentally flawed. To sell through Purple Bricks, sellers have to pay an upfront fee of \u00a3899. If the property doesn\u2019t sell, they get nothing for their money. High street agents charge far more, but only if they make a sale. In a fast-moving market, the Purple Bricks offer makes sense: the number of homes listed makes pricing a property easier. And \u00a3899 can seem a bargain compared with the big money a traditional agent will charge even on a property that sells within days. But in a slow market \u2013 which is most of the south of England right now \u2013 sellers can misprice a property and never find a buyer. Even in a \u201cnormal\u201d market, only 58% of homes listed at traditional agents find a buyer. Purple Bricks says its conversion rate is 75%, but that still means a quarter of its customers are shelling out \u00a3899 for nothing. Tellingly, last week Purple Bricks said that in the US it was going to shift to fees payable only on completion. Pressure will build for the same here \u2013 but that could leave Purple Bricks with reduced initial cash flow and, on 75% sales conversion, knock revenue by a quarter. It might be a very long time before big early investors in Purple Bricks, such as star fund manager Neil Woodford, see much of a return.",

      "bodyText": "Joan Baez has been singing her songs of protest for 60 years, her matchless soprano voice rising above trouble. She can look back on an extraordinary career that included a new interpretation of Bob Dylan songs in the 60s, and singing for Martin Luther King (with whom she became friends). The daughter of a Mexican-born physicist and a strong-minded Scottish mother, she has announced, at 78, that she is now on her last tour, performing her swansong album Whistle Down the Wind. What moved you to record the album Whistle Down the Wind after a 10-year gap? I felt it was time. I\u2019m phasing out and wanted to choose something to bookend my first album. My original album has a song about a silver dagger; my last a song about a silver blade. The first was a traditional folk song \u2013 the girl lost out.

      "body": "<p>Everyone talks about Orson Welles making his dazzling movie directing debut at 25 years old; but really we should also be talking about Stanley Donen doing the same thing: co-directing the musical On the Town in 1949 at the same age with Gene Kelly. And when they together made Singin\u2019 in the Rain \u2013 and film history \u2013 Donen was still only 28.<br><br>There is a real link between directing and choreography, controlling camera positioning and movement, and those of the actors themselves. Donen was a director, Broadway dancer and choreographer, and also a radical innovator who brought new life and form to the movie musical, embedding its musical and dance conventions into the imagined action and making it work as cinema. And it is no accident that this masterpiece is specifically about cinema re-inventing itself: emerging from the silent era to a new world of sound \u2013 that innovation which allowed the musical to exist. He was at the very centre of that magical period of the MGM musical, a part of cinema history which rests so materially on his special creative relationship with Kelly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce6d2b32ec39f4498ed2ed1d4e6efe7b5c20a2df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce6d2b32ec39f4498ed2ed1d4e6efe7b5c20a2df/0_234_2660_1596/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn in Two for the Road.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn in Two for the Road.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He also had a special relationship with his childhood idol Fred Astaire, and with the great bluebloods of the Hollywood aristocracy of which Donen himself was one of the very last survivors, including Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. Quite aside from his gargantuan achievement in musicals, Donen would prove himself a master of the elegant Hitchcockian caper, and also an experimentalist in storytelling with his underrated portrait-of-a-marriage film, scripted by Frederic Raphael from Donen\u2019s own idea: Two for the Road in 1967, with Hepburn and Albert Finney.<br><br>But it\u2019s Singin\u2019 in the Rain that we always return to: it bursts at every seam with light and colour and joy, and Donen and Kelly shape and guide its irresistible energy with inspired grace. The story of an established star (Kelly) who falls for a young up-and-comer (Debbie Reynolds) just as the industry is in crisis, is a counter-tragic version of A Star Is Born: this is A Genre Is Born, or A Medium Is Re-Born.<br><br>In some ways, my favourite scene is the Moses Supposes song from Kelly and Donald O\u2019Connor, playing Kelly\u2019s musical director and pal, when they gleefully start singing about the silliness of the studio\u2019s elocution instruction. It looks as if the song itself is improvised, made up on the spot, out of pure excitement, pure well-being, pure love of life. The same goes for Kelly\u2019s astonished delight at seeing Reynolds jump out of the cake at the swanky Hollywood party and starting to hoof and belt out All I Do Is Dream of You - having haughtily told Kelly that as a theatre person she disapproves of the silly business of movies. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t Ethel Barrymore!\u201d grins Kelly \u2013 the greatest double meet-cute of all time. The same supercharged energy drives O\u2019Connor\u2019s staggering tour de force Make Em Laugh and of course Kelly\u2019s centrepiece \u201csinging in the rain\u201d dance sequence. Donen and Kelly\u2019s direction, and Kelly\u2019s dancing, was athletic, stylish and an example of non-toxic masculinity. It was generous and strong, a vivid, almost evangelical statement of postwar American optimism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb49de8bb8815cf05d7efee29243fbc6094d6a25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb49de8bb8815cf05d7efee29243fbc6094d6a25/0_214_3600_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On the Town ...

Frank Sinatra, Betty Garrett, Jules Munshin, Ann Miller, Gene Kelly, Vera-Ellen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MGM/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before that, Kelly and Donen had collaborated on On the Town, a shore-leave adventure which boldly used real city locations. Donen had an instinctive grasp of how the musical worked when it was muscular and forthright and uninhibited, but also within its own world of mannered artifice. Maybe that was never truer than in Royal Wedding (1951) with Fred Astaire, whose own miraculous lighter-than-air style was different from Kelly\u2019s more visceral approach. This was the movie with Astaire\u2019s dancing-up-the-walls-and-on-to-ceiling scene, a trick shot achieved with a camera fixed into a set within a rotating drum: it was not Donen\u2019s own idea, but he carried it off with aplomb.<br><br>Seven Brides For Seven Brothers (1954) was Donen\u2019s other great MGM hit, a film in which Donen\u2019s direction worked well with the ingenuous, unreflective masculinity of Howard Keel. Later in that staggeringly productive decade, Donen would re-unite with Astaire on Funny Face (1957) - this time for Paramount, not MGM. It\u2019s a slightly uneasy May-to-September romance between Astaire and Audrey Hepburn (30 years his junior) and it doesn\u2019t quite age as well, but Donen brings to it charm and a lightness of touch.<br><br>Donen\u2019s remarkably prolific career carried on into the 1960s outside the studio system that gave birth to him, and partly in the UK as a kind of exile from its various tensions and discontents. This was a period in which he demonstrated his knack for the dapper romantic comedy-thriller, beginning a new relationship with Cary Grant in films like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/13/charade-audrey-hepburn-cary-grant\">Charade</a> and Indiscreet. It was also a decade in which Donen was eager to be in touch with the new creative currents and he plugged into the British satire boom, creating a cult comedy in Bedazzled (1967) with Peter Cook and Dudley Moore - perhaps the nearest anyone came to capturing Cook\u2019s comic inspiration on film.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"761ac4a3141398ad21ebb9dda04a8db39dab937a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/761ac4a3141398ad21ebb9dda04a8db39dab937a/0_44_1816_1090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn in Charade.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn in Charade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Universal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two for the Road is a late gem, in which he elicited great performances from Hepburn and Finney; they are the deeply unhappy married couple on holiday in the south of France, in scenes interspersing their disillusionment with their earlier happiness in the same locations. This was a measured, naturalistic character piece: intelligent, sympathetic and accessible - and notable in that it was the first time Hepburn had worked with a leading man younger than she was. It was emblematic of the old coming to terms with the new, which was what Donen was trying to do. <br><br>In the end of course, it is the sheer gorgeousness of Singin\u2019 in the Rain for which he will be most immediately remembered and treasured: certainly in my heart. It\u2019s a film which distills happiness and hope.</p>",

It looks as if the song itself is improvised, made up on the spot, out of pure excitement, pure well-being, pure love of life. The same goes for Kelly\u2019s astonished delight at seeing Reynolds jump out of the cake at the swanky Hollywood party and starting to hoof and belt out All I Do Is Dream of You - having haughtily told Kelly that as a theatre person she disapproves of the silly business of movies. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t Ethel Barrymore!\u201d grins Kelly \u2013 the greatest double meet-cute of all time. The same supercharged energy drives O\u2019Connor\u2019s staggering tour de force Make Em Laugh and of course Kelly\u2019s centrepiece \u201csinging in the rain\u201d dance sequence. Donen and Kelly\u2019s direction, and Kelly\u2019s dancing, was athletic, stylish and an example of non-toxic masculinity. It was generous and strong, a vivid, almost evangelical statement of postwar American optimism. Before that, Kelly and Donen had collaborated on On the Town, a shore-leave adventure which boldly used real city locations. Donen had an instinctive grasp of how the musical worked when it was muscular and forthright and uninhibited, but also within its own world of mannered artifice. Maybe that was never truer than in Royal Wedding (1951) with Fred Astaire, whose own miraculous lighter-than-air style was different from Kelly\u2019s more visceral approach. This was the movie with Astaire\u2019s dancing-up-the-walls-and-on-to-ceiling scene, a trick shot achieved with a camera fixed into a set within a rotating drum: it was not Donen\u2019s own idea, but he carried it off with aplomb. Seven Brides For Seven Brothers (1954) was Donen\u2019s other great MGM hit, a film in which Donen\u2019s direction worked well with the ingenuous, unreflective masculinity of Howard Keel. Later in that staggeringly productive decade, Donen would re-unite with Astaire on Funny Face (1957) - this time for Paramount, not MGM. It\u2019s a slightly uneasy May-to-September romance between Astaire and Audrey Hepburn (30 years his junior) and it doesn\u2019t quite age as well, but Donen brings to it charm and a lightness of touch. Donen\u2019s remarkably prolific career carried on into the 1960s outside the studio system that gave birth to him, and partly in the UK as a kind of exile from its various tensions and discontents. This was a period in which he demonstrated his knack for the dapper romantic comedy-thriller, beginning a new relationship with Cary Grant in films like Charade and Indiscreet. It was also a decade in which Donen was eager to be in touch with the new creative currents and he plugged into the British satire boom, creating a cult comedy in Bedazzled (1967) with Peter Cook and Dudley Moore - perhaps the nearest anyone came to capturing Cook\u2019s comic inspiration on film. Two for the Road is a late gem, in which he elicited great performances from Hepburn and Finney; they are the deeply unhappy married couple on holiday in the south of France, in scenes interspersing their disillusionment with their earlier happiness in the same locations. This was a measured, naturalistic character piece: intelligent, sympathetic and accessible - and notable in that it was the first time Hepburn had worked with a leading man younger than she was. It was emblematic of the old coming to terms with the new, which was what Donen was trying to do. In the end of course, it is the sheer gorgeousness of Singin\u2019 in the Rain for which he will be most immediately remembered and treasured: certainly in my heart. It\u2019s a film which distills happiness and hope.",

Ivory Coast supplies 30% of the cocoa beans for the world chocolate market but the average daily earnings for a farmer here is just a bit more than the price of a KitKat:<a href=\"https://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/resources/2018-04_Report_Fairtrade_Cocoa_Farmer_Income.pdf\" title=\"\"> 74p</a>. \u201cI\u2019m not sure any more that international trade can bring people out of poverty here,\u201d the governor said. \u201cBecause though we grow the cocoa, the market happens elsewhere.\u201d</p> <p>The meeting with the governor came during a few days I spent travelling between cocoa farms and villages in the company of Michael Gidney, the chief executive of Fairtrade UK, and Anne-Marie Yao (or \u201cMama Cocoa\u201d, as she is known to the farmers here), who is in charge of developing and certifying Fairtrade co-operatives in west Africa . As the governor spoke, I jotted down the links in the chain of value that he described. Only the first of those links occurs here: the <a href=\"https://makechocolatefair.org/issues/cocoa-production-nutshell\" title=\"\">hard labour</a> that nurtures cocoa trees and removes the beans from their pods, then shells and dries them and sells them at a fixed price through traders into a global market. The far more lucrative links, those that create processed products and branded chocolate bars for our supermarket shelves, are practically all in Europe, cornered by half a dozen or so vast corporations, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/mondelez\" title=\"\">Mond\u0113lez</a> (which owns Cadbury), Nestl\u00e9 or Mars.</p> <p>Among the most important final destinations for Ivory Coast cocoa is the UK, where <a href=\"http://www.divinechocolate.com/uk/about-us/research-resources/resources/chocolate-facts\" title=\"\">700,000 tonnes of chocolate are consumed each year</a>, or 11kg per person, or three bars a week. But the relationship between the UK chocolate consumers and the west African producers has undergone a profound shift. When cocoa prices were high in the 1970s, the beans accounted for nearly half of the value of a chocolate bar. Today, producers receive around<a href=\"https://makechocolatefair.org/issues/cocoa-prices-and-income-farmers-0\" title=\"\"> 6% of the value</a> of the final product. The rest goes to branded manufacturers, who take roughly a 44% share, and retailers who take 35%. The price wars at our supermarket checkouts do not impact each link of the supply chain equally. In 2018, the year after the price of cocoa paid to farmers in Ivory Coast fell by a third, the Swiss-based Barry Callebaut, the world\u2019s biggest supplier of chocolate and cocoa products, posted a 12% jump in profits to $288m.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1c5636053379f21be6cd8a9d43305f6388a51433\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c5636053379f21be6cd8a9d43305f6388a51433/0_288_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children of cocoa farmers near Adzope\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children of cocoa farmers near Adzope.

Green &amp; Black\u2019s Maya Gold was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/may/13/ethicalbusiness.fairtrade\" title=\"\">first product to be stamped with the Fairtrade logo</a>, 25 years ago, in March 1994. There are now several hundred Fairtrade chocolate products on UK shelves (still only about 13% of the market \u2013 Green &amp; Black\u2019s, now owned by Mond\u0113lez, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/03/green-blacks-new-uk-chocolate-bar-not-organic-fairtrade\" title=\"\">has withdrawn from Fairtrade</a> to operate under its own certification system).</p> <p>Because the squeeze in the value of the commodity makes the situation of cocoa farmers ever more precarious, <a href=\"http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/get%20involved/Current-campaigns/Fairtrade-Fortnight/Fairtrade-Fortnight-for-Campaigners\" title=\"\">Fairtrade Fortnight</a>, the annual effort to raise awareness of trade justice issues, which begins on Monday, will focus once again on chocolate. The guaranteed minimum price for Fairtrade cocoa is rising 20% to $2,400 a tonne, to which is added a $240 premium available to use for investment in social and economic projects. There is, too, a particular focus on women. \u201cShe deserves a living income\u201d, runs the event\u2019s tagline.</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to travel far from the governor\u2019s offices into the low hills and forest around Adzop\u00e9 out east to the Ghanaian border to feel the full force of that demand. The cocoa villages are desperately poor. Some have no access to a water pump, few have sanitation or drainage. Electricity is still a limited and miraculous thing.</p> <p>Old customs die hard in these villages. Before visiting the co-operative farms, it is routinely necessary to pay a visit to the village chief, a hereditary position, and take part in a ceremony involving sharing water with his representatives, while the main man sits impassive in a plastic garden chair.</p> <p>The best of the co-operative farms I saw, by contrast, do all they can to embrace progress. They have large handpainted signs up which detail their commitments, including pledges to outlaw child labour and protect the threatened forest land. The farmers explain some of the challenges to these commitments. At night, \u201cforesti\u00e8res\u201d will come and illegally chop down hardwood trees at the edge of their farms, a practice that is rarely prosecuted by corrupt officials, who blame the farmers themselves. \u201cIf it is the producers who are cutting down trees, why do we remain so poor?\u201d the farmers say, with follow-the-money logic. (There is enough money in one large hardwood tree to cover three years of money that cocoa farmers can earn from their crop.)</p> <p>Surveys suggest that there are still more than <a href=\"https://www.sustainablegoals.org.uk/child-labour-cocoa-sector/\" title=\"\">2 million children working in west Africa\u2019s cocoa fields</a>, some using hazardous chemicals or working with machetes. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2017/apr/12/west-african-children-rescued-from-slavery-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Trafficking and slavery</a> remain endemic.

In her two years in charge, Bamba has overcome resistance from more traditional voices by almost doubling the yield of the co-op\u2019s farms through training, and \u2013 using the Fairtrade premium \u2013 led diversification into poultry and egg production (which also produces fertiliser for 100 farms).</p> <p>She has directed investment to a Cayat radio station to disseminate messages about agronomy and health, and toward nursery schools that allow women the freedom to work. A micro-loan scheme has been created, women lending to women, which carries zero interest if used for school fees. When she first attended the training, Bamba was asked about her aspirations. She said: \u201cI want to be young and married and in leadership.\u201d</p> <p>In the course of a few days, I met many other women who have gone through the programme and assumed leadership positions. Talking to them is like watching <em>Educating Rita</em> on fast forward. Leocadi Voh, 53, who has raised seven children on one hectare of land, explained to me how she employed new techniques to create the record yield for her co-op and used micro-finance to send her eldest daughter to university to be a vet.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.fairtrade.org.uk/Farmers-and-Workers/Cocoa/Rosine-Bekoin\" title=\"\">Rosine Bekoin</a>, who has since her training adopted a kick-ass blond highlight to her hair, now runs the plant nursery at Cayat.

Her husband tells me he was initially unsure about the training, \u201cbut now Rosine shines bright\u201d.</p> <p>One of the problems the co-operatives face is that the market will only take a proportion of their cocoa on Fairtrade terms. Prices remains volatile and, in between the two annual harvests, farmers find themselves desperate to feed their families. That \u201chungry month\u201d desperation creates opportunity for \u201cpisteurs\u201d, the traditional local agents who bypass the collective arrangements of the co-op and pay farmers in cash. In one village we met Vincent Jafferi, who insists he is an \u201cexceptionally honest\u201d pisteur. He works out of a little office, and took up the job because a disability prevents him from working the land.</p> <p>Such men as Jafferi are sometimes portrayed as the villains of the value chain, giving farmers less than their crop is worth. In reality, obviously, they are small components in a system weighted against them as well as farmers. Jafferi takes a couple of kilos commission for each 30 kilos of beans he sells, and has no control of the next stages of the market in which international cocoa traders manipulate notorious volatility in demand and supply. In a good month, Jafferi makes \u00a3100.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ec7f128288b3a7e50a68efd04c4605a5b39497f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec7f128288b3a7e50a68efd04c4605a5b39497f4/0_0_3840_5760/667.jpg\" alt=\"A cocoa farming village in Camaye Cooperative, Abengourou.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cocoa farming village in Camaye Cooperative, Abengourou.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Terry/Fairtrade</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Gidney observes: \u201cFarmers need sales but, to make sales work in a sustainable way, they need market intelligence, about trends in chocolate buying.

Those who peddle that idea seem to want to offer a nostalgic promise of re-establishing old trading relationships, cutting out EU regulation. Shackles are often mentioned.

      "bodyText": "Asking about the importance of cocoa in Ivory Coast feels a little like making enquiries about the value of grapes in Burgundy. When I put the question to N\u2019Zi Kanga R\u00e9mi, who has for the last 18 years beengovernor of the rural department of Adzop\u00e9, north-east of the sprawling port city of Abidjan, he leaned forward in his chair and fixed me with an amused stare. His booming voice went up a decibel to fill the administrative offices on whose walls his own portrait alternated with that of his nation\u2019s president. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to ask an Ivorian what cocoa means to him!\u201d he said. \u201cIt means everything! It\u2019s his first source of income! My education was funded by cocoa! Our houses are built with cocoa! The foundations of our roads, our schools, our hospitals is cocoa! Our government runs on cocoa! All our policy focuses on sustaining cocoa!\u201d The governor leaned back in his chair and looked for confirmation from the representatives of a local cocoa co-operative who sat with us around the table. He then set about itemising some of the many challenges to that sustainability \u2013 the problems of climate change and deforestation and disease, the ongoing crisis of child labour \u2013 and some of the ways they were being addressed. All the solutions he described led back to one intractable problem, however: it has become next to impossible for the 6 million people dependent on cocoa in his country to survive on the money they receive for their crop. Ivory Coast supplies 30% of the cocoa beans for the world chocolate market but the average daily earnings for a farmer here is just a bit more than the price of a KitKat: 74p. \u201cI\u2019m not sure any more that international trade can bring people out of poverty here,\u201d the governor said. \u201cBecause though we grow the cocoa, the market happens elsewhere.\u201d The meeting with the governor came during a few days I spent travelling between cocoa farms and villages in the company of Michael Gidney, the chief executive of Fairtrade UK, and Anne-Marie Yao (or \u201cMama Cocoa\u201d, as she is known to the farmers here), who is in charge of developing and certifying Fairtrade co-operatives in west Africa . As the governor spoke, I jotted down the links in the chain of value that he described. Only the first of those links occurs here: the hard labour that nurtures cocoa trees and removes the beans from their pods, then shells and dries them and sells them at a fixed price through traders into a global market. The far more lucrative links, those that create processed products and branded chocolate bars for our supermarket shelves, are practically all in Europe, cornered by half a dozen or so vast corporations, such as Mond\u0113lez (which owns Cadbury), Nestl\u00e9 or Mars. Among the most important final destinations for Ivory Coast cocoa is the UK, where 700,000 tonnes of chocolate are consumed each year, or 11kg per person, or three bars a week. But the relationship between the UK chocolate consumers and the west African producers has undergone a profound shift. When cocoa prices were high in the 1970s, the beans accounted for nearly half of the value of a chocolate bar. Today, producers receive around 6% of the value of the final product. The rest goes to branded manufacturers, who take roughly a 44% share, and retailers who take 35%. The price wars at our supermarket checkouts do not impact each link of the supply chain equally. In 2018, the year after the price of cocoa paid to farmers in Ivory Coast fell by a third, the Swiss-based Barry Callebaut, the world\u2019s biggest supplier of chocolate and cocoa products, posted a 12% jump in profits to $288m. When this crisis in value for small farmers first became clear, it led to the idea of a new relationship between the consumer in the UK and the cocoa producer, one which valued transparency of the supply chain. Green &amp; Black\u2019s Maya Gold was the first product to be stamped with the Fairtrade logo, 25 years ago, in March 1994. There are now several hundred Fairtrade chocolate products on UK shelves (still only about 13% of the market \u2013 Green &amp; Black\u2019s, now owned by Mond\u0113lez, has withdrawn from Fairtrade to operate under its own certification system). Because the squeeze in the value of the commodity makes the situation of cocoa farmers ever more precarious, Fairtrade Fortnight, the annual effort to raise awareness of trade justice issues, which begins on Monday, will focus once again on chocolate. The guaranteed minimum price for Fairtrade cocoa is rising 20% to $2,400 a tonne, to which is added a $240 premium available to use for investment in social and economic projects. There is, too, a particular focus on women. \u201cShe deserves a living income\u201d, runs the event\u2019s tagline. You don\u2019t have to travel far from the governor\u2019s offices into the low hills and forest around Adzop\u00e9 out east to the Ghanaian border to feel the full force of that demand. The cocoa villages are desperately poor. Some have no access to a water pump, few have sanitation or drainage. Electricity is still a limited and miraculous thing. Old customs die hard in these villages. Before visiting the co-operative farms, it is routinely necessary to pay a visit to the village chief, a hereditary position, and take part in a ceremony involving sharing water with his representatives, while the main man sits impassive in a plastic garden chair. The best of the co-operative farms I saw, by contrast, do all they can to embrace progress. They have large handpainted signs up which detail their commitments, including pledges to outlaw child labour and protect the threatened forest land. The farmers explain some of the challenges to these commitments. At night, \u201cforesti\u00e8res\u201d will come and illegally chop down hardwood trees at the edge of their farms, a practice that is rarely prosecuted by corrupt officials, who blame the farmers themselves. \u201cIf it is the producers who are cutting down trees, why do we remain so poor?\u201d the farmers say, with follow-the-money logic. (There is enough money in one large hardwood tree to cover three years of money that cocoa farmers can earn from their crop.) Surveys suggest that there are still more than 2 million children working in west Africa\u2019s cocoa fields, some using hazardous chemicals or working with machetes. Trafficking and slavery remain endemic. The Fairtrade co-operatives monitor and outlaw these practices but for most families there is still the necessity for children to help with appropriate tasks after school. The research suggests that the most effective ways of changing that situation is through greater empowerment of women in what remain highly patriarchal communities. There are 18 steps in cocoa preparation and women do 15 of them, but few have legal title to land or much say in decision making. Yao \u2013 Mama Cocoa \u2013 has been pioneering a scheme to combat that fact. One of the first graduates of her Women\u2019s School of Leadership is Awa Bamba, the director general of a co-op called Cayat, which involves more than 3,000 farmers in 38 villages. In her two years in charge, Bamba has overcome resistance from more traditional voices by almost doubling the yield of the co-op\u2019s farms through training, and \u2013 using the Fairtrade premium \u2013 led diversification into poultry and egg production (which also produces fertiliser for 100 farms). She has directed investment to a Cayat radio station to disseminate messages about agronomy and health, and toward nursery schools that allow women the freedom to work. A micro-loan scheme has been created, women lending to women, which carries zero interest if used for school fees. When she first attended the training, Bamba was asked about her aspirations. She said: \u201cI want to be young and married and in leadership.\u201d In the course of a few days, I met many other women who have gone through the programme and assumed leadership positions. Talking to them is like watching Educating Rita on fast forward. Leocadi Voh, 53, who has raised seven children on one hectare of land, explained to me how she employed new techniques to create the record yield for her co-op and used micro-finance to send her eldest daughter to university to be a vet. Rosine Bekoin, who has since her training adopted a kick-ass blond highlight to her hair, now runs the plant nursery at Cayat. She proudly gives me a tour of the rows of 30,000 young cocoa plants that will replace ageing trees. Her husband tells me he was initially unsure about the training, \u201cbut now Rosine shines bright\u201d.

Before she died, <a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/charles-catherine-dickens-asylum/\" title=\"\">he writes</a> in the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em>, the dying Catherine confided in a friend, Edward Dutton Cook, who told another correspondent: \u201cHe even tried to shut her up in a lunatic asylum, poor thing! But bad as the law is in regard to proof of insanity he could not quite wrest it to his purpose.\u201d</p> <p>The new information accords, as Bowen says, with existing evidence that Dickens, once he was besotted with Ellen Ternan, deliberately circulated lies about his wife\u2019s sanity, alluding to \u201ca mental disorder under which she sometimes labours\u201d. Responding to Bowen\u2019s discovery, Dickens\u2019s biographer Clare Tomalin told MailOnline: \u201cI think during this period he was mad effectively and their lives were thrown into turmoil.\u201d</p> <p>Along with his possible insanity, any reputational readjustment must also take into account Dickens\u2019s close friendship with a fellow gaslighter, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, a powerful politician and novelist, during a period Wise says was \u201cthe high-water mark of the Victorian malicious lunacy incarceration phenomenon\u201d.</p> <p>After his (sane) estranged wife, Rosina, publicly denounced his \u201cunexampled career of vice\u201d, at a political hustings, Bulwer-Lytton secured the medical signatures needed to have her carried off, in 1858, to a private asylum, a nightmare she later described in <em>A Blighted Life</em>. (That same month, Bowen notes, the Dickenses separated.) \u201cNever,\u201d Rosina wrote, \u201cwas a more criminal or despotic Law passed than that which now enables a Husband to lock up his Wife in a Madhouse on the certificate of two medical men, who often in haste, frequently for a bribe, certify to madness where none exists.\u201d Dickens, she describes as \u201cthat patent Humbug\u201d.</p> <p>A year after Rosina escaped, Dickens published, in his journal <em>All the Year Round</em>, Wilkie Collins\u2019s <em>The Woman in White</em>, based on a true story of false incarceration in a Parisian asylum. The principal villain, Sir Percival Glyde, says of one victim: \u201cShe\u2019s just mad enough to be shut up and just sane enough to ruin me when she\u2019s at large.\u201d</p> <p>How substantial, if any, will be the damage to Dickens? Must he now shift into the creative subset, genius wife torturers, along with Philip Roth, Kingsley Amis, Picasso, Hemingway, Ted Hughes? His devotees could argue, against such an outcome, that Bulwer-Lytton got away with it. If, moreover, in the years since Dickens invented Catherine\u2019s mental disorder health practitioners have become more reluctant to collaborate with controlling spouses, variations on gaslighting have definitely outlived him, in public as well as private life. While the responses to #MeToo, and <em>The Archers</em> storyline, have increased recognition of this form of abuse, crude public insinuations about the mental stability of prominent women remain, in contrast, permissible.</p> <p>Were, for example, the intentions of Andrew Neil notably enlightened, when the BBC presenter described my colleague, the award-winning journalist Carole Cadwalladr, as the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/18/the-chilling-undertones-of-andrew-neil-mad-cat-woman-tweet\" title=\"\">mad cat woman</a> from [<em>The</em>] <em>Simpsons</em>, Karol Kodswallop\u201d?

If you ask chef Brian Donnelly of <a href=\"https://www.biarebel.com/\" title=\"\">Bia Rebel</a> to explain how he makes his food, he will tell you. He will go into quite extraordinary detail. There will be hand gestures and a lot of enthusiasm. If you\u2019re a little short on time, perhaps it\u2019s best just to order and keep the questions to a minimum. Otherwise, do ask, because it\u2019s a hell of a story, with a beginning, a middle and an end, that end being the engrossing bowl of ramen he will serve you.</p> <p>This is the thing: we are used to lengthy, sweaty-palmed stories around complex dishes, but for the most part they come greased with excess and largesse and huge price tags. The great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/dec/07/pierre-koffmann-cooks-cook-dan-doherty\" title=\"\">Pierre Koffmann</a>\u2019s recipe for braised pig\u2019s trotter, boned and stuffed with a chicken mousseline and morels, then glazed with a veal and madeira jus, takes pages of a cookery book, and days to prepare (not forgetting years of training to perfect; it requires surgical skill to bone out a trotter). We therefore accept that we will have to sell the most attractive of our limbs to pay for it.</p> <p>But an \u00a38 bowl of ramen? That surely doesn\u2019t deserve prose poems? Well why the hell not? The result may seem humble, but getting it right certainly isn\u2019t. Donnelly grew up in Northern Ireland, but learned his trade at Gordon Ramsay\u2019s Aubergine and <a href=\"http://www.le-gavroche.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Le Gavroche</a> with Michel Roux Jnr, before crossing back over the Irish Sea to be head chef of Thornton\u2019s in Dublin. He has run massive brigades. He can do things with knives and knows one end of a sauce from another.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c0ff99240bdf8dc9b0d54f2971bb7cc469d27c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c0ff99240bdf8dc9b0d54f2971bb7cc469d27c0/1150_500_3931_3610/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018They make their own noodles.

It has a few seats at a counter, a long communal table down the middle of the room for a few more, and a vibrant mural on the wall demanding you #slurpmynoodles. The setting may be different, but the culinary intensity is just the same.</p> <p>Last autumn, Bia Rebel \u2013 bia is Irish for food \u2013 won the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/oct/22/ofm-awards-2018-best-cheap-eats-bia-rebel-belfast-ramen-restaurant\" title=\"\">best cheap eats</a> gong in the <em>Observer Food Monthly</em> awards, voted for by the readers. Being in the city for a day or two, it seemed only fair that I drag a few friends along to try it out. Happily, I can confirm our readers have impeccable taste. Does Bia Rebel serve the very best bowl of ramen you will ever eat in the United Kingdom? No, not quite. I\u2019d put that served by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/nov/25/tonkotsu-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\" title=\"\">Tonkotsu</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/nov/02/shoryu-ramen-sasuke-ippudo-london-restaurant-reviews-jay-rayner\" title=\"\">Shoryu</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/26/nanban-restaurant-kitchen-encounters-tim-anderson\" title=\"\">Nanban</a> (the latter run by my friend Tim Anderson) above it. But then that\u2019s extremely tough competition.</p> <p>In any case, I don\u2019t believe it is trying to compete, and its offering also happens to be a lot cheaper than those others. As Jenny Holland said when they won the <em>OFM</em> award last year, \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to be Japanese. We\u2019re an Irish restaurant. It just so happens this wonderful, perfect dish we\u2019re making is considered Japanese. Provided you adhere to basic building blocks you can make it what you want.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c426e3d5c84b4bc7a634a04c8d15b71f0a06b760\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c426e3d5c84b4bc7a634a04c8d15b71f0a06b760/1389_429_4039_3516/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Local twist: Belfast shoyu ramen is made with pork shoulder, rather than belly, to suit the Northern Irish palate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"871\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Local twist: Belfast shoyu ramen is made with pork shoulder, rather than belly, to suit the Northern Irish palate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lewis McClay, The Hype Factory</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which is what they do. They make their own wheat noodles. Their meaty broth has 26 ingredients and takes 40 hours to make. Donnelly starts with a sofrito, the finest dice of vegetables cooked down until they have given all they have to give to a dish, which apparently takes hours. A chicken broth is made with chicken wings, also cooked for hours. It is blended with dashi broth. They add a 606 egg, so called because it is cooked in a water bath for six minutes and six seconds. You sense that Donnelly loves that detail. He then smokes it over Oolong tea. Not Lapsang souchong or Darjeeling. Oolong. It is a very good egg, the smoky yolk perfectly fixed in that place between runny and set.</p> <p>There are around 10 permutations on the basic theme. The Belfast Shoyu ramen contains thick slices of chashu-roasted pork, a beautiful reddy bronze, here made with shoulder rather than the classic belly. \u201cWe use shoulder because the balance of fat to meat suits the Northern Irish palate,\u201d Donnelly says. What matters most, of course, is the broth, which is swimming pool deep and savoury, without leaving you fearing you\u2019ll be chugging water through a restless night\u2019s sleep. The noodles have a fair bite. (According to Tim Anderson, ramen wheat noodles must be made with kansui alkaline water. I\u2019ll confess I didn\u2019t check the pH level of the noodles. This is remiss of me.)</p> <p>Rebel spicy pork ramen is a vibrant Hades-red, courtesy of deep slicks of chilli oil, and comes heaped with piles of ground pork, flavoured with more chillies. Most of them work like this: the name of the dish tells you what you\u2019re going to get. The meat in a Celtic spicy beef ramen has indeed been introduced to a lot of fresh chilli; the hoisin BBQ pulled pork ramen has pulled shoulder spun through with hoisin. It is both sweet and salty. All of them come stacked with nori and spring onions, sweetcorn and fresh chilli or garlic. On a frigid winter\u2019s night in Belfast their various ramens feel less like a bowl of dinner than a guttering fireside in front of which to warm yourself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ddbd7caf0f72224f24e8b1bf88125eb8af00add1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddbd7caf0f72224f24e8b1bf88125eb8af00add1/1303_570_3505_3505/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Not all noodles: silky-skinned gyoza to start.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not all noodles: silky-skinned gyoza to start.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lewis McClay, The Hype Factory</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The only item which made me furrow my brow is the achingly named Ramenara Ramen, which they say is their take on a carbonara, involving bacon and parmesan cheese.

      "bodyText": "Bia Rebel, 409 Ormeau Road, Belfast BT7 3GP (02895 435 964). Ramen \u00a36-\u00a38. Sides \u00a34-\u00a36. Be aware. If you ask chef Brian Donnelly of Bia Rebel to explain how he makes his food, he will tell you. He will go into quite extraordinary detail. There will be hand gestures and a lot of enthusiasm. If you\u2019re a little short on time, perhaps it\u2019s best just to order and keep the questions to a minimum. Otherwise, do ask, because it\u2019s a hell of a story, with a beginning, a middle and an end, that end being the engrossing bowl of ramen he will serve you. This is the thing: we are used to lengthy, sweaty-palmed stories around complex dishes, but for the most part they come greased with excess and largesse and huge price tags. The great Pierre Koffmann\u2019s recipe for braised pig\u2019s trotter, boned and stuffed with a chicken mousseline and morels, then glazed with a veal and madeira jus, takes pages of a cookery book, and days to prepare (not forgetting years of training to perfect; it requires surgical skill to bone out a trotter). We therefore accept that we will have to sell the most attractive of our limbs to pay for it. But an \u00a38 bowl of ramen? That surely doesn\u2019t deserve prose poems? Well why the hell not? The result may seem humble, but getting it right certainly isn\u2019t. Donnelly grew up in Northern Ireland, but learned his trade at Gordon Ramsay\u2019s Aubergine and Le Gavroche with Michel Roux Jnr, before crossing back over the Irish Sea to be head chef of Thornton\u2019s in Dublin. He has run massive brigades. He can do things with knives and knows one end of a sauce from another. Now, with his business partner Jenny Holland, he brings all of that to the task of running a small ramen shop on the Ormeau Road in Belfast. It has a few seats at a counter, a long communal table down the middle of the room for a few more, and a vibrant mural on the wall demanding you #slurpmynoodles. The setting may be different, but the culinary intensity is just the same. Last autumn, Bia Rebel \u2013 bia is Irish for food \u2013 won the best cheap eats gong in the Observer Food Monthly awards, voted for by the readers. Being in the city for a day or two, it seemed only fair that I drag a few friends along to try it out. Happily, I can confirm our readers have impeccable taste. Does Bia Rebel serve the very best bowl of ramen you will ever eat in the United Kingdom? No, not quite. I\u2019d put that served by Tonkotsu, Shoryu and Nanban (the latter run by my friend Tim Anderson) above it. But then that\u2019s extremely tough competition. In any case, I don\u2019t believe it is trying to compete, and its offering also happens to be a lot cheaper than those others. As Jenny Holland said when they won the OFM award last year, \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to be Japanese. We\u2019re an Irish restaurant. It just so happens this wonderful, perfect dish we\u2019re making is considered Japanese. Provided you adhere to basic building blocks you can make it what you want.\u201d Which is what they do.

Uruguay, which is best known for the wines it makes from tannat, the French heavyweight grape, has some good, Atlantic breeze-cooled spots for making whites, and a refreshingly different portfolio of varieties planted in them. Albari\u00f1o, still not all that common outside Iberia, has found a happy new home in the Maldonado region with briskly fresh and peachily aromatic wines, such as Bodega Garzon Albari\u00f1o 2017 (\u00a314.95, <a href=\"https://www.slurp.co.uk/bodega-garzon-albarino-2017\">Slurp</a>).

In their conclusion, this sentence leaps out: \u201cThis report supports the view that inequalities in health are partly driven by inequalities in the labour market. Policies that increase the number of working-age adults in sustainable, paid employment that protects their physical and mental health would make an important contribution to improving health outcomes.\u201d</p> <p>These words will resonate with campaigners seeking justice for the victims of asbestos-related disease in Scotland. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/12/scotland-asbestos\" title=\"\">history of asbestos in Scotland</a> largely mirrors that of the rest of the world and is characterised by the rapid growth in profits for the industrialists. This is equalled only by their zeal in ensuring that an awareness of the dangers of asbestos to workers was concealed for as long as possible.</p> <p>Asbestos manufacturing in the west of Scotland began almost 140 years ago and within a few decades every ship made on the Clyde carried asbestos panels.

      "bodyText": "In the dismal argot of government, few working-class families in west central Scotland have not been adversely affected by bad health \u201cchoices\u201d and \u201coutcomes\u201d. Heart disease and cancer in particular seem to have developed a peculiar attachment to those who lived and worked near yards and factories and inhaled the fumes of mass production. Politicians, academics and health professionals \u2013 almost all of them sincere and intent on doing the right thing \u2013 like to reduce their analysis of these patterns of bad health into easily digestible bites that seem to make sense to the rest of us. If only we would all drink less, eat better and reduce our salt and sugar intake, why Scotland could become the gym bunny of Europe. Of course, they\u2019re all right and their work has led to a better understanding of our bad health and greater funding to address it. Poor personal choices might contribute greatly to ill-health but many of these are rooted in causes that few people can control: unemployment, low wages, unacceptable workplace health and safety and loss of self-esteem. In their important research paper, Health Outcomes and determinants by occupation and industry in Scotland, 2008-2011, Martin Taulbut and Gerry McCartney analysed the effects of the workplace on the health of Scottish workers. In their conclusion, this sentence leaps out: \u201cThis report supports the view that inequalities in health are partly driven by inequalities in the labour market. Policies that increase the number of working-age adults in sustainable, paid employment that protects their physical and mental health would make an important contribution to improving health outcomes.\u201d These words will resonate with campaigners seeking justice for the victims of asbestos-related disease in Scotland. The history of asbestos in Scotland largely mirrors that of the rest of the world and is characterised by the rapid growth in profits for the industrialists. This is equalled only by their zeal in ensuring that an awareness of the dangers of asbestos to workers was concealed for as long as possible. Asbestos manufacturing in the west of Scotland began almost 140 years ago and within a few decades every ship made on the Clyde carried asbestos panels. It was found to be a cheap option in providing heat insulation and thus became widely used by building contractors and housing associations. Inevitably, it became a primary material in the construction of new schools and university and college buildings. Research into its adverse effects on those involved in their construction and those who later used these buildings was routinely covered up by companies happy to wade in its profits. In his essay for the New Statesman more than a decade ago entitled Asbestos: The Lies that Killed, Ed Howker describes the tactics of the Lancashire manufacturing giant Turner &amp; Newall, once the world\u2019s largest asbestos conglomerate. The firm \u201cexposed millions to a lethal carcinogen in full knowledge of its dangers, using PR firms and politicians to hide a truth which it had secretly admitted to in 1961, namely that \u2018the only really safe number of asbestos fibres in the works environment is nil\u2019\u201d.

Our employers used the tax savings to buy back their shares of stock and give themselves raises instead.</p> <p>Then you fooled us into thinking we were getting a cut by lowering the amounts withheld from our 2018 paychecks. We know that now because we\u2019re getting smaller tax refunds.</p> <p>At the same time, many big corporations aren\u2019t paying a dime in taxes. Worse yet, they\u2019re getting refunds.</p> <p>For example, GM is paying zilch and claiming a $104m refund on $11.8bn of profits. Amazon is paying no taxes and claiming a $129m refund on profits of $11.2bn. (This is after New York <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/23/amazon-new-york-headquarters-corporate-power-balance\">offered it $3bn</a> to put its second headquarters there.)</p> <p>They aren\u2019t breaking any tax laws or regulations. That\u2019s because they made the tax laws and regulations. You gave them a free hand.</p> <p>You\u2019re supposed to be working for us, not for giant corporations. But they\u2019re doing better than ever, as are their top executives and biggest investors. Yet nothing has trickled down. We\u2019re getting shafted.</p> <p>Which is why more than 75% of us (including 45% who call ourselves Republicans) support Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s proposed 70% tax on dollars earned in excess of $10m a year.</p> <p>And over 60% of us support <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/22/elizabeth-warren-childcare-2020-election\">Elizabeth Warren</a>\u2019s proposed 2% annual tax on households with a net worth of $50m or more.</p> <p>You\u2019ve also shown you don\u2019t have a clue about healthcare. You promised us something better than the Affordable Care Act but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/23/healthcare-us-americans-uninsured-2014-gallup\">all you\u2019ve done is whittle it back</a>.</p> <p>A big reason we gave Democrats control of the House last November was your threat to eliminate protection for people with pre-existing conditions.</p> <p>Are you even aware that 70% of us now favor Medicare for all?</p> <p>Most of us don\u2019t pay much attention to national policy but we pay a lot of attention to home economics. You\u2019ve made our own home economics worse.</p> <p>We\u2019ll give you official notice you\u2019re fired on 3 November 2020, if not before.

      "bodyText": "Robert Mueller\u2019s soon-to-be-delivered report will begin months of congressional investigations, subpoenas, court challenges, partisan slugfests, media revelations, and more desperate conspiracy claims by Donald Trump, all against the backdrop of the burning questions: Will he be impeached by the House? Will he be convicted by the Senate? Will he pull a Richard Nixon and resign? In other words, will America fire Trump? I have news for you. America has already fired him. When the public fires a president before election day, as it did Jimmy Carter, Nixon and Herbert Hoover, they don\u2019t send him a letter telling him he\u2019s fired. They just make him irrelevant. Politics happens around him, despite him. He\u2019s not literally gone but he might as well be. It has happened to Trump. The courts and House Democrats are moving against him. Senate Republicans are quietly subverting him. Even Mitch McConnell told him to end the shutdown. The Fed is running economic policy. Top-level civil servants are managing day-to-day work of the agencies. Isolated in the White House, distrustful of aides, at odds with intelligence agencies, distant from his cabinet heads, Trump has no system to make or implement decisions. His tweets don\u2019t create headlines as before. His rallies are ignored. His lies have become old hat. Action and excitement have shifted elsewhere, to Democratic challengers, even to a 29-year-old freshman congresswoman too young to run. Don\u2019t get me wrong. He\u2019s still dangerous, like an old landmine buried in the mud. He could start a nuclear war. Yet even America\u2019s adversaries just humor him. Kim Jong-un and Xi Jinping give him tidbits to share with the American public, then do whatever they want. Why did America fire him? If the nation were to write him a letter informing him he\u2019s no longer president, it would go like this: Dear Mr President, While many of us disagree on ideology and values, we agree on practical things like obeying the constitution and not letting big corporations and the wealthy run everything. Your 35-day government shutdown was a senseless abuse of power. So too your \u201cnational emergency\u201d to build your wall with money Congress refused to appropriate. When you passed your tax bill you promised our paychecks would rise by an average of $4,000 but we never got the raise. Our employers used the tax savings to buy back their shares of stock and give themselves raises instead. Then you fooled us into thinking we were getting a cut by lowering the amounts withheld from our 2018 paychecks. We know that now because we\u2019re getting smaller tax refunds. At the same time, many big corporations aren\u2019t paying a dime in taxes. Worse yet, they\u2019re getting refunds. For example, GM is paying zilch and claiming a $104m refund on $11.8bn of profits. Amazon is paying no taxes and claiming a $129m refund on profits of $11.2bn. (This is after New York offered it $3bn to put its second headquarters there.) They aren\u2019t breaking any tax laws or regulations. That\u2019s because they made the tax laws and regulations. You gave them a free hand. You\u2019re supposed to be working for us, not for giant corporations. But they\u2019re doing better than ever, as are their top executives and biggest investors. Yet nothing has trickled down. We\u2019re getting shafted. Which is why more than 75% of us (including 45% who call ourselves Republicans) support Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s proposed 70% tax on dollars earned in excess of $10m a year. And over 60% of us support Elizabeth Warren\u2019s proposed 2% annual tax on households with a net worth of $50m or more. You\u2019ve also shown you don\u2019t have a clue about healthcare. You promised us something better than the Affordable Care Act but all you\u2019ve done is whittle it back. A big reason we gave Democrats control of the House last November was your threat to eliminate protection for people with pre-existing conditions. Are you even aware that 70% of us now favor Medicare for all? Most of us don\u2019t pay much attention to national policy but we pay a lot of attention to home economics. You\u2019ve made our own home economics worse. We\u2019ll give you official notice you\u2019re fired on 3 November 2020, if not before. Until then, you can keep the house and perks, but you\u2019re toast. Respectfully, America.",

      "body": "<p>Less than two weeks after Shamima Begum was discovered in a Syrian refugee camp, she\u2019s public enemy number one. Eight in 10 people believe she should be <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/shamima-begum-78-of-britons-support-revoking-is-brides-uk-citizenship-sky-data-poll-11643068\" title=\"\">stripped of her British citizenship</a>; 65% say so, even if that leaves her stateless.</p> <p>The home secretary, Sajid Javid, might regard this as vindication of his disgraceful decision to deprive Begum of her citizenship last week. But others have expressed dismay at the level of public vitriol.</p> <p>However, it is entirely predictable. I think of my first reaction: not compassion, but anger at the abhorrent views she expressed about Islamic State\u2019s victims. If I had loved ones killed by these terrorists I like to think I\u2019d be one of those amazing souls who moves quickly to forgive. But I suspect I\u2019d be in the \u201clock her up and throw away the key\u201d brigade.</p> <p>On one level we, the public, don\u2019t have to work through the discombobulating mix of disgust and pity she inspires. You don\u2019t have to deny she is responsible for any crimes she may have committed in order to think she should be brought back to the UK to be held accountable. Once she\u2019s back, we can leave assessing guilt to the courts.</p> <p>There is a danger in allowing the vilification of Begum to go unchallenged. Turning someone into a monster is a protection mechanism: it absolves us from thinking about moral complexity. It permits us to consign evil deeds to a place beyond the pale of understanding. But we lose something important if we don\u2019t try to understand how evil manifests itself: the capacity to prevent it.</p> <p>Take child abuse. <a href=\"https://frameworksinstitute.org/assets/files/ECD/nspcc_values.pdf\" title=\"\">Studies suggest</a> we view its causes as \u201cdeep and immutable\u201d, so evil that it\u2019s inexplicable. That leads us to believe that the only way to prevent it is to find the evil people and lock them up. To see it as preventable through other means, such as therapeutic interventions, which <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/CAN-Prevention-Technical-Package.pdf\" title=\"\">research shows</a> is possible, is to render child abusers too human for comfort. Understanding feels too close to absolution.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/24/sajid-javid-pander-rightwing-press-shamima-begum\">Javid is pandering to rightwing press over Shamima Begum | Roy Greenslade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In counselling the need for greater understanding of Begum\u2019s actions, some have drawn parallels with the grooming of young girls by paedophile gangs in places such as Rotherham. It\u2019s an analogy that leaves me deeply uncomfortable. Yes, grooming techniques were used on Begum. But in the one case, girls as young as 10 were groomed purely for sexual exploitation; in the other, yes, a 15-year old was married, albeit willingly, to a man almost twice her age. But Isis grooms young men and women to fight for a terrorist force that commits genocide. That\u2019s why I find the \u201cshe\u2019s nothing more than a child victim\u201d line hard to swallow. What if someone who was radicalised as a child goes on to commit terrible atrocities as an adult? It\u2019s not a hypothetical; we don\u2019t know the extent of Begum\u2019s crimes, but radicals have committed atrocities in the name of Isis.</p> <p>Begum\u2019s case reminds me more of a book I read as a teenager \u2013 the 1981 novel <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wave_(novel)\" title=\"\">The Wave</a></em>, based on events at a California high school. A class of students struggles to understand why ordinary Germans stood by as the Nazis systematically murdered 6 million Jews. Their teacher sets up an authoritarian membership organisation that demands absolute obedience from its members. Things escalate quickly into violence. The story ends with an assembly to unveil the new leader of a national movement to create youth wings across other schools. An image of Adolf Hitler is projected on to the screen. It also brings to mind the Stanford prison experiment, in which a psychology professor randomly assigned volunteers to be \u201cguards\u201d or \u201cprisoners\u201d in a two-week prison simulation. Within a few days some guards were psychologically abusing and torturing prisoners.</p> <p>The common thread in both is that ordinary people can be induced to act in unsavoury ways, through indoctrination or simulated conditions. And indoctrination is part of the radicalisation process; <em>Times </em>reporter Anthony Loyd describes how Begum displays the hallmarks of other indoctrinated jihadists <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/decoding-shamima-begum-why-we-shouldnt-be-surprised-by-her-lack-of-remorse-mbgxdbtzf\" title=\"\">he\u2019s interviewed</a> before.</p> <p>For me, the more difficult question about Begum\u2019s case is not whether she should be held accountable for any crimes \u2013 of course she should \u2013 it\u2019s this: what would I have done had I found myself in her shoes having already made the utterly stupid, dreadful decision to travel to Syria as a 15-year-old? What would I have done as a prison guard in the Stanford experiment? I know what I like to think I\u2019d have done, but can we ever be 100% sure?</p> <p>Perhaps those of us who have never had our capacity to commit evil under malign influence tested are lucky, rather than pure. That\u2019s one reason to be grateful for the rule of law. Another is that it allows us the luxury of kneejerk reaction because we\u2019re not in charge of meting out punishment ourselves.</p> <p>But Javid, by weighing in to use powers that politicians have awarded themselves to deprive Begum of citizenship without due process, is messing with that. He\u2019s starting us on the slippery slope to trial by public opinion. And vigilante justice has tragic consequences; one of the worst examples is the man who, mistaken for a paedophile, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/29/vigilante-murder-paedophile-bristol-bijan-ebrahimi\" title=\"\">brutally beaten up</a> and set alight five years ago.

      "bodyText": "Less than two weeks after Shamima Begum was discovered in a Syrian refugee camp, she\u2019s public enemy number one. Eight in 10 people believe she should be stripped of her British citizenship; 65% say so, even if that leaves her stateless. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, might regard this as vindication of his disgraceful decision to deprive Begum of her citizenship last week. But others have expressed dismay at the level of public vitriol. However, it is entirely predictable. I think of my first reaction: not compassion, but anger at the abhorrent views she expressed about Islamic State\u2019s victims. If I had loved ones killed by these terrorists I like to think I\u2019d be one of those amazing souls who moves quickly to forgive. But I suspect I\u2019d be in the \u201clock her up and throw away the key\u201d brigade. On one level we, the public, don\u2019t have to work through the discombobulating mix of disgust and pity she inspires. You don\u2019t have to deny she is responsible for any crimes she may have committed in order to think she should be brought back to the UK to be held accountable. Once she\u2019s back, we can leave assessing guilt to the courts. There is a danger in allowing the vilification of Begum to go unchallenged. Turning someone into a monster is a protection mechanism: it absolves us from thinking about moral complexity. It permits us to consign evil deeds to a place beyond the pale of understanding. But we lose something important if we don\u2019t try to understand how evil manifests itself: the capacity to prevent it. Take child abuse. Studies suggest we view its causes as \u201cdeep and immutable\u201d, so evil that it\u2019s inexplicable. That leads us to believe that the only way to prevent it is to find the evil people and lock them up. To see it as preventable through other means, such as therapeutic interventions, which research shows is possible, is to render child abusers too human for comfort. Understanding feels too close to absolution. In counselling the need for greater understanding of Begum\u2019s actions, some have drawn parallels with the grooming of young girls by paedophile gangs in places such as Rotherham. It\u2019s an analogy that leaves me deeply uncomfortable. Yes, grooming techniques were used on Begum. But in the one case, girls as young as 10 were groomed purely for sexual exploitation; in the other, yes, a 15-year old was married, albeit willingly, to a man almost twice her age. But Isis grooms young men and women to fight for a terrorist force that commits genocide. That\u2019s why I find the \u201cshe\u2019s nothing more than a child victim\u201d line hard to swallow. What if someone who was radicalised as a child goes on to commit terrible atrocities as an adult? It\u2019s not a hypothetical; we don\u2019t know the extent of Begum\u2019s crimes, but radicals have committed atrocities in the name of Isis. Begum\u2019s case reminds me more of a book I read as a teenager \u2013 the 1981 novel The Wave, based on events at a California high school. A class of students struggles to understand why ordinary Germans stood by as the Nazis systematically murdered 6 million Jews. Their teacher sets up an authoritarian membership organisation that demands absolute obedience from its members. Things escalate quickly into violence. The story ends with an assembly to unveil the new leader of a national movement to create youth wings across other schools. An image of Adolf Hitler is projected on to the screen. It also brings to mind the Stanford prison experiment, in which a psychology professor randomly assigned volunteers to be \u201cguards\u201d or \u201cprisoners\u201d in a two-week prison simulation. Within a few days some guards were psychologically abusing and torturing prisoners. The common thread in both is that ordinary people can be induced to act in unsavoury ways, through indoctrination or simulated conditions. And indoctrination is part of the radicalisation process; Times reporter Anthony Loyd describes how Begum displays the hallmarks of other indoctrinated jihadists he\u2019s interviewed before. For me, the more difficult question about Begum\u2019s case is not whether she should be held accountable for any crimes \u2013 of course she should \u2013 it\u2019s this: what would I have done had I found myself in her shoes having already made the utterly stupid, dreadful decision to travel to Syria as a 15-year-old? What would I have done as a prison guard in the Stanford experiment? I know what I like to think I\u2019d have done, but can we ever be 100% sure? Perhaps those of us who have never had our capacity to commit evil under malign influence tested are lucky, rather than pure. That\u2019s one reason to be grateful for the rule of law. Another is that it allows us the luxury of kneejerk reaction because we\u2019re not in charge of meting out punishment ourselves. But Javid, by weighing in to use powers that politicians have awarded themselves to deprive Begum of citizenship without due process, is messing with that. He\u2019s starting us on the slippery slope to trial by public opinion. And vigilante justice has tragic consequences; one of the worst examples is the man who, mistaken for a paedophile, was brutally beaten up and set alight five years ago. In recent years, eight people have killed themselves after being labelled paedophiles by vigilante hunters. Holocaust survivor Primo Levi said: \u201cMonsters exist, but they are too few in number to be truly dangerous. More dangerous are the common men, the functionaries ready to believe and to act without asking questions.\u201d Nothing I have read suggests Begum is a monster. I wonder how many of us would be functionaries in the wrong circumstances. We like to think we embrace the rule of law because we\u2019re better people. But what if we\u2019re better people because we embrace the rule of law? That, ultimately, is why Javid\u2019s actions are so troubling. \u2022 Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "It would have been fascinating to be a fly on the wall, or a bug in the software, at last week\u2019s meeting in San Francisco between Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary, and Mark Zuckerberg, the elusive boss of Facebook. Mr Wright did not willingly share a lot of data afterwards, though who knows what might end up online. He described the talks as \u201cuseful\u201d, while Facebook reported a \u201cpositive and productive conversation\u201d. The fact that a cabinet minister was obliged to travel to California, after Mr Zuckerberg declined repeated invitations to appear before parliament, gives an insight into the relative balance of power as pressure grows to impose a semblance of order, integrity and legality on a chaotic online digital world. By deigning to meet, Mr Zuckerberg gave the impression that he was doing Wright a big favour. This sort of untouchable arrogance lies at the heart of the problem. Facebook and similar multinational, multibillion dollar digital companies now have the power to enter, and influence, almost every aspect of modern daily life. Their conduct, or misconduct, has a direct impact on our democracy, politics and wellbeing, as shown by the Observer\u2019s revelations about Cambridge Analytica\u2019s activities in the 2016 referendum. While there are undoubted benefits, unregulated (or \u201cself-regulated\u201d) global digital platforms can negatively affect the quality and tone of social discourse. They facilitate the spread of disinformation and fake news. The online world has, for many, become an unsafe place where child exploitation, cyber-bullying and sexual and racial harassment flourish. Grievous harms, especially affecting younger people, can be the result, as was the case with Molly Russell, whose family claimed she took her life after viewing material glorifying suicide on Facebook\u2019s Instagram photo-sharing site. Mr Wright\u2019s Californian tour, which also involved meetings with Google, Twitter and YouTube, comes as the government prepares a white paper with legislative and non-legislative proposals for tackling online risks. Mr Wright says he believes government regulation is necessary. \u201cIt is clear that things need to change. With power comes responsibility and the time has come for the tech companies to be properly accountable,\u201d he said last week. Two key questions demand answers. One is whether any government action will be undertaken with the necessary degree of urgency. To date, ministers, Mr Wright included, have been slow, to the point of irresponsibility, in recognising the immediacy and scale of the problem. It has been rightly pointed out that, if a general election were to be called today, the process would be open to online manipulation, by domestic and foreign influences, of the kind that marred other recent polls, including the 2016 Brexit referendum and US elections. A second pressing concern is whether any new regulations will be sufficiently robust and wide-ranging to decisively change the behaviour of powerful businesses such as Facebook and, say, reduce opportunities for online disruption by ill-disposed foreign governments. Ministers are rightly focused on social harms. They appear to be less enthusiastic about tackling overtly political issues such as past and present pro-Brexit disinformation, data theft for commercial purposes, online privacy abuses and, for example, Russian and far-right cyber-meddling. Mr Wright says the white paper is just a starting point. This relaxed approach is not nearly good enough. Germany and France have already taken firm action to curb online abuses. Why is Britain trailing behind? If they need motivation, ministers should study last week\u2019s excoriating report by Damian Collins\u2019s all-party select committee, which declared British electoral law to be unfit for purpose and demanded tougher, all-round online company regulation and oversight. \u201cDemocracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised \u2018dark adverts\u2019 from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day,\u201d Mr Collins said.

This review is not for you. If, however, you are a motorist who is open to the idea of spending less time in your car (for the health of yourself and the planet, but probably not your wallet \u2013 this is a very expensive bike), then you might be interested to meet the <a href=\"https://www.stromerbike.com/en_GB.html\" title=\"\">Stromer</a>. It\u2019s a phenomenally fast, dizzyingly innovative and dangerously addictive ride that\u2019s part bicycle and part rocket booster. At the end of my week testing it I couldn\u2019t decide whether I was relieved to hand it back <em>or</em> if I\u2019d ever want to ride my normal bike again.</p> <p>The game-changing brand \u2013 which I find impossible not to call Stormer \u2013 was founded in 2009 by Thomas Binggeli, and opened the doors to its solar-powered, state-of-the-art factory in Oerwangen, near Bern, in 2013. From the off, Stromer positioned its electric bike as a car-alternative (maybe that should be a \u201ccarlternative\u201d).

This review is not for you. If, however, you are a motorist who is open to the idea of spending less time in your car (for the health of yourself and the planet, but probably not your wallet \u2013 this is a very expensive bike), then you might be interested to meet the Stromer. It\u2019s a phenomenally fast, dizzyingly innovative and dangerously addictive ride that\u2019s part bicycle and part rocket booster. At the end of my week testing it I couldn\u2019t decide whether I was relieved to hand it back or if I\u2019d ever want to ride my normal bike again. The game-changing brand \u2013 which I find impossible not to call Stormer \u2013 was founded in 2009 by Thomas Binggeli, and opened the doors to its solar-powered, state-of-the-art factory in Oerwangen, near Bern, in 2013. From the off, Stromer positioned its electric bike as a car-alternative (maybe that should be a \u201ccarlternative\u201d).

      "bodyText": "Donald Keene, a renowned scholar of Japanese literature whose writing and translations inspired generations of students with an interest in Japan, has died aged 96. The New York-born Keene, recipient of the country\u2019s highest cultural award, died of heart failure at a hospital in Tokyo early on Sunday, reports said. Keene is best known for his translations of dozens of works of classical and modern Japanese literature, and for winning global recognition for the 11th century Tale of Genji, generally considered to be the world\u2019s first novel. The work by Murasaki Shikibu, Keene wrote in a 2008 memoir, had served as his own introduction to Japanese literature, when, as an 18-year-old student, he bought a two-volume translation for 49 cents in a Times Square bookshop. Keene was instrumental in promoting Japanese studies, a field of academia that was barely recognised when he became an undergraduate student of French and Greek literature at Columbia College in the late 1930s. His prolific output spanned about 25 books in English, including translations of both classical and modern writers \u2013 including his friends the novelists Yukio Mishima and Yasunari Kawabata \u2013 and 30 books in Japanese. His first anthology of Japanese literature was published in 1955, and his biography of the Meiji Emperor appeared in Japanese in 2001 and in English the following year. Keene, a lifelong pacifist, worked as an interpreter for the US navy during the second world war, interrogating Japanese prisoners of war and translating diaries and documents. He earned his PhD from Columbia in 1949, and taught at Cambridge University before returning to Columbia in 1955, where he taught for more than five decades. \u201cProfessor Keene played the leading role in the establishment of Japanese literary studies in the United States and beyond,\u201d the university\u2019s Donald Keene center of Japanese culture said on its website. \u201cThrough his scholarship, translations, and edited anthologies, and through the work of students he trained and inspired, he did more than any other individual to further the study and appreciation of Japanese literature and culture around the world in the postwar era.\u201d In 2008, Keene became the first foreigner to receive the Order of Culture from the Japanese government, in recognition of his contribution to literature. He gave his final lecture as an emeritus professor at Columbia in 2011, the year he settled in Japan in a show of solidarity with a country reeling from the tsunami and nuclear disasters of March that year. \u201cI gradually thought of Japan as a place where I would like to live, and also where I would like to die,\u201d he said in a 2015 interview. Keene became a Japanese citizen the year after he moved to Tokyo, and adopted a Japanese man, Seiki Keene, as his son and heir in 2013.",

Many political journalists recalled Bonner from his time working with ministers in Canberra. Twitter users were quick to recall the \u201cfake tradie\u201d furore that consumed part of the 2016 election campaign. Labor\u2019s election policy, branded a \u201cretirement tax\u201d by the government, aims to stop tax refunds to self-funded retirees who pay no tax but who are entitled to claim a refund for franking credits on shares. On Thursday the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Tony Smith, criticised the chair of a parliamentary franking credits inquiry, the Liberal MP Tim Wilson, by noting he had broken conventions by creating a private website to solicit submissions against Labor\u2019s policy, and by the apparent coordination of meetings with one of its primary opponents. Labor has pushed for Wilson to be referred to the parliamentary privileges committee over alleged politicisation of the inquiry. Wilson authorised a partisan website stoptheretirementtax.com, part-funded by Geoff Wilson, his first-cousin once-removed, which garners submissions opposed to Labor\u2019s policy and signs submitters up to a Wilson Asset Management petition, a company chaired by Geoff Wilson. In September Geoff Wilson boasted to investors he had asked Tim Wilson to schedule inquiry hearings alongside Wilson Asset Management roadshow events to help investors protest against Labor\u2019s policy.",

Convoys of trucks carrying food aid and medical supplies set off for Venezuela from border towns in Colombia and Brazil, joined by opposition leaders and volunteers. Supporters were met with teargas and rubber bullets, and at least three aid trucks near the Colombian border were burned. None of the shipments made it past Venezuelan border blockades. At least four people have died, and almost 300 were injured in clashes with security forces. At least 60 members of the Venezuelan military and police defected at the borders. Protesters took to the street in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, and marched on a military airport. A ship carrying 250 tons of humanitarian aid from Puerto Rico was forced to turn back when the Venezuelan Navy threatened to open fire. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello called this \u201ca direct threat against a humanitarian mission being carried out by American citizens.\u201d Clashes continued along the border. In Pacaraima, Brazil, the Venezuelan national guard responded to rocks and molotov cocktails that never reached them by launching tear gas at about 50 demonstrators. In Cucuta, Colombia, there were rubber bullets, tear gas and casualties. Meanwhile, the state government of the Brazilian border state of Roraima reported that five Venezuelan patients with gunshot wounds were treated in Brazil on Saturday. Embattled president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro rallied his supporters with a speech where he labeled the opposition forces trying to get aid into the country \u201ctraitors\u201d, and denounced alleged interference by the United States. In a joint press conference with the president of Colombia, opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 said the military did not owe loyalty to regime that would burn food in front of hungry people. He called on them to leave their posts and said he would meet with the Lima Group and US vice president Mike Pence on Monday to work out a way forward on the crisis. Opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 has tweeted: \u201cThe events of today oblige me to take a decision \u2013 to propose formally to the international community that we should keep open all options for the liberation of our homeland, which is fighting and will continue to fight. Hope was not born to die Venezuela!\u201d We have an update about the number of those injured today. Civil defense officials in Colombia say at least 285 people have been injured in clashes at border bridge crossings. Condemnation of Maduro\u2019s government and its decision to block aid shipments into the country has been coming in from countries across Latin America, including Argentina, whose government has just released this statement: The Argentine Government strongly condemns the actions of the Maduro regime that prevented the entry of humanitarian aid from neighboring countries, aimed at alleviating the dramatic situation in which millions of Venezuelans are currently living. In the same way, it firmly repudiates the repression deployed by the regime\u2019s forces, which caused several deaths and dozens of wounded. The Argentine Government renews its support to the president-in-charge Juan Guaid\u00f3 and the support to the efforts that it carries out together with the National Assembly to allow the entry of food and medicines destined to alleviate the suffering that the policies of the Maduro regime have imposed on all Venezuelan people. The Argentine president, Mauricio Macri, has tweeted in support of Juan Guaid\u00f3. \u201cThe situation in which Venezuelans live is dramatic,\u201d wrote Macri. \u201cI want to condemn the repression deployed by Maduro and his actions to prevent the Venezuelan people from receiving humanitarian aid.\u201d Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, has been tweeting a lot over the last hour, condemning the actions of Maduro, whom Pompeo called a \u201csick tyrant\u201d. Pompeo accused Maduro of sending gangs of armed thugs out to attack innocent people, adding that the images of burning trucks of aid are \u201csickening\u201d. Here are those tweets: Venezuelan new channel, VPI TV, have this footage, which they say is of a member of the National Guard who defected tonight. In the footage the man claims he was given orders to \u201cmassacre the people\u201d and that Maduro released prisoners from jails to carry out attacks against the people today. This is the first we\u2019re hearing of claims like this and the Guardian will be seeking to verify them. \u2018How many of you have a sick mother?\u2019 Guaid\u00f3 appeals to military to leave Maduro Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido said he will meet US Vice President Mike Pence at a meeting Monday of regional diplomats. The emergency meeting of foreign ministers from the so-called Lima Group of mostly conservative Latin American nations was organized to discuss Venezuela\u2019s crisis. It will take place in Colombia\u2019s capital of Bogota. Guaido, whom the US and some 50 nations recognize as Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader, spoke from Colombian city of Cucuta alongside Colombian President Ivan Duque after a day of deadly clashes with security forces blocking the entry of humanitarian aid amassed on three of Venezuela\u2019s borders. While insisting he wouldn\u2019t give up in his fight to deliver the aid, he didn\u2019t ask supporters to continue risking their lives and make another attempt to break the barricades set up by President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s socialist government. But he did make one more appeal to troops to join the opposition\u2019s fight for power. \u201cHow many of you national guardsmen have a sick mother? How many have kids in school without food,\u201d he said, standing alongside a warehouse where some 200 tons of mostly US-supplied boxes of food and medicine has been stockpiled. The secretary general of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, has been speaking. He calls what has been going on in Venezuela \u201cthe worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life\u201d. Venezuelan journalist Gabriel Bastidas has this translation: \u201cWhile the regime denies aid, children and sick are still dying. It\u2019s the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. Violent killing and injuring people who moved medicine boxes. \u201cIt demonstrated the savagery and barbarity with which the regime acted to prevent the entry of humanitarian aid. The international community must absolutely respond.\u201d He also praised those border guards who abandoned their posts and fled into Colombia, saying: \u201cWe particularly value the military who have joined in recognizing Guaid\u00f3. That will be essential to regaining democracy.\u201d Opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 will be meeting with the Lima Group, which was established in 2017 to find a peaceful end to the Venezuelan crisis, on Monday. Joining them will be US vice-president Mike Pence. Speaking at the joint press conference now, opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 says the military does not owe loyalty to regime that would burn food in front of hungry people. Guaid\u00f3 says he will participate in Group of Lima meeting in Bogota on Monday to try and resolve the situation. Venezuealan journalist Gabriel Bastidas has this translation of sections of the Colombian president\u2019s speech. We\u2019re working on getting you the full text of his, as well as Guaid\u00f3\u2019s speech. \u201cToday we saw how thousands of citizens mobilized to serve their brethren,\u201d said Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez, the president of Colombia. \u201cWe have seen the repression sought by all mechanisms to prevent humanitarian aid. This is the opportunity for the whole world to tell the dictator that it is enough, that the end of oppression has come.\u201d \u201cFaced with the barbaric events that occurred, I asked the Venezuelan volunteers to collect the trucks so as not to expose them to more aggression and to protect the aid. \u201cToday the world witnessed dozens of Venezuelan soldiers crossing the border to offer their allegiance to President Guaid\u00f3.\u201d He says that on Monday there will be a meeting to. discuss a way forward to end the impasse. \u201cToday the dictatorship has sealed its moral and diplomatic defeat. It has become clear to the world that as much violence as they try, Venezuela will regain freedom with the strength of ideas and the mobilization of the country.\u201d The joint press conference held by the president of Colombia, Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez, the secretary general of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, and Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 has begun. Watch live here. Maduro has posted a video of himself driving through the streets of Caracas, we he describes as \u201ccalm\u201d and \u201cquiet\u201d. \u201cCrossing the streets of Caracas \u2013 calm, quiet,\u201d tweeted the president. \u201cI send my greetings and I thank the people of New York for their active solidarity, expressed in the streets, with Venezuela. Peace will prevail!\u201d He thanks those in New York who participated in solidarity protests on Saturday, in which protesters urged the US government to stay out of Venezuela and lift sanctions against the country. Opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 will be giving a press conference in about 20 minutes, alongside the president of Colombia and the secretary general of the Organization of American States. \u201cI ask you all to be attentive,\u201d he says. Hello everyone, this is Kate Lyons taking over the blog from Vivian Ho. Thanks for following along. After a day of violence across Venezuela\u2019s border regions in which at least four people were killed, dozens injured, 60 border guards fled into Colombia seeking asylum, and three aid trucks were burned, the country finds itself at something of a stalemate. Aid still has not reached the people of Venezuela and while the number of border guards leaving their posts has continued to rise through the day, there has not been the mass defection that might have indicated a significant shift in the allegiance of the military. Neither President Nicolas Maduro nor opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 are backing down. Maduro, who appeared at a rally early today, has just shared a video showing his supporters marching in the streets in Caracas, remaking on the \u201cimpressive force of the people\u201d. Whereas Guaid\u00f3 has vowed to \u201cstay in the streets until we win our freedom.\u201d A ship carrying 250 tons of humanitarian aid from Puerto Rico was forced to turn back when the Venezuelan Navy threatened to open fire. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello called this \u201ca direct threat against a humanitarian mission being carried out by American citizens.\u201d Clashes continued along the border. In Pacaraima, Brazil, the Venezuelan national guard responded to rocks and molotov cocktails that never reached them by launching tear gas at about 50 demonstrators. In Cucuta, Colombia, there were rubber bullets, tear gas and casualties. Meanwhile, the state government of the Brazilian border state of Roraima reported that five Venezuelan patients with gunshot wounds were treated in Brazil on Saturday. The number of defections continued to rise, as opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 vowed to \u201cstay in the streets until we win our freedom.\u201d Puerto Rico governor Ricardo Rossello issued a statement on the Venezuelan Navy threatening to open fire on a ship carrying humanitarian aid: \u201cThis is a direct threat against a humanitarian mission being carried out by American citizens,\u201d Rossello said. \u201cThis is unacceptable and shameful.\u201d \u201cI have given instructions that our ship leave the area temporarily in order to ensure the crew\u2019s and passengers\u2019 safety. We have notified our partners in the US government about this serious incident. We are in talks to determine the best course of actino forward.\u201d Opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 confirmed earlier reports that a ship carrying humanitarian aid from Puerto Rico received \u201cthreat of fire from a Navy frigate.\u201d As evening fell on Venezuela, opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 vowed to keep fighting. \u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 wrote on Twitter. \u201cIf they thought we were going to tire, they were wrong.\u201d \u201cWe will stay in the streets until we win our freedom,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 wrote. The number of defectors continues to rise. A ship carrying 250 tons of humanitarian aid from Puerto Rico was forced by the Venezuelan Navy to turn back, according to El Nuevo Diario. The Nicaraguan newspaper reports that a Venezuelan deputy said at a news conference that the ship was \u201cbesieged.\u201d Earlier Saturday, Puerto Rico governor Rossell\u00f3 issued a statement about the ship. \u201cThe objective of this mission is humanitarian and we demand respect for the integrity of the crew and the media who are on the boat,\u201d he said. The Twitter account for the Puerto Rico government then tweeted out the El Nuevo Diario article reporting the failed mission. Journalist Mariana Reyes reports that the ship currently sits in international waters, awaiting instruction. The Venezuelan Navy had threatened to open fire on the ship, she said. Joe Parkin Daniels reports from Cucuta, Colombia: Emily Costa reports from Pacaraima, Brazil: A small number of around 50 demonstrators have thrown rocks and molotov cocktails in the direction of Venezuelan military on the border. Though none of the projectiles reached the military, the Venezuelan national guard reacted by launching tear gas at the demonstrators. The state government of the Brazilian border state of Roraima has updated its news on Venezuelan casualties and said that five Venezuelan patients with gunshot wounds were treated in Brazil on Saturday. All five are in serious condition and were first attended in Pacaraima. They are now being moved to the Roraima General Hospital in Boa Vista. The state government had earlier said four Venezuelans had been treated on Saturday. It said the Roraima General Hospital received nine Venezuelan patients on Friday and named them as Fidel Fernandez, 36, Geber Rivero, 21, Kliver Rivero, 24, Rolando Martinez, 52, Alfredo Perez, 48, Evencio Sosa, 44, Onesimo Fernandez, 48, Lino Benavides and Alger Romero. Kliver Rivero is in intensive care with gunshot wounds to his thorax and abdomen and he has wounds to his liver and intestine. Rolando Martinez is in the trauma unit in a serious condition and breathing with assistance. Alger Romero was released and the others are considered stable. Two others were treated for lesser injuries in Pacaraima on Friday and released. Convoys of trucks carrying food aid and medical supplies set off for Venezuela from border towns in Colombia and Brazil, joined by opposition leaders and volunteers. Supporters were met with teargas and rubber bullets, and at least three aid trucks near the Colombian border were burned. None of the shipments have so far made it past Venezuelan border blockades. At least 23 members of the Venezuelan military and police defected at the borders. At least one person was killed in the town of Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n, near the Venezuelan border with Brazil, where security forces clashed with protesters. Non-profit groups reported that as many as four people may have been killed. Protesters took to the street in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, and marched on a military airport. Embattled president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro rallied his supporters with a speech where he labeled the opposition forces trying to get aid into the country \u201ctraitors\u201d, and denounced alleged interference by the United States. Emily Costa reports from Pacaraima, Brazil: Both aid trucks have left the border and headed back into Pacaraima for what Venezuelan volunteers said were \u201csafety reasons,\u201d following an argument and suspicions over a person taking photos. Patricia Torres reports from Caracas: Supporters of president Nicolas Maduro turned out for a rally where the embattled leader denounced the opposition trying to bring humanitarian aid shipments into the country as \u201ctraitors\u201d and inveighed against the United States. \u201cI came to support president Maduro. I think the humanitarian aid is a trick, a strategy to manipulate us. We aren\u2019t in a crisis or at war, we are just going through difficult times,\u201d said Lenny Campo, 38, a housewife from C\u00fapirain Miranda state. \u201cThe opposition wants everything for themselves, and to end the revolution. If the revolution ends, nothing will be the same and everything president Chavez left for us will be undone.\u201d \u201cI came to demonstrate that we can continue with this revolution. We aren\u2019t going to allow the gringos to come and invade us,\u201d said Aura Zamora, 54, from Acevedo in Miranda state. \u201cWe need the aid, but the problem is that the gringos want to use it as an excuse to invade the country, and we won\u2019t allow that. We can solve our problems ourselves, with our president\u201d Joe Parkin Daniels reports from Cucuta, Colombia: On the Santander bridge separating C\u00facuta and the Venezuelan town of Ure\u00f1a, gangs loyal to Maduro pelted stones at advancing opposition supporters from atop a truck. Smoke billowed, while tear gas was launched from the Venezuelan side towards Colombia, causing the crowds to flee in panic. Ten minutes later the opposition supporters advanced and were met with the same response. Rubber bullets also flew from Venezuela towards Colombia and paramedics carried their victims to a first aid tent on the Colombian side of the border. \u201cI was crossing the bridge when a rubber bullet hit me, said Carlos Juancho, a student from Merida who travelled to help shift the aid across the border, as he kept pressure on a neck wound. \u201cThis is how Maduro treats his people.\u201d Venezuelan forces have fired tear gas at people on the Francisco de Paula Santander bridge between Colombia and Venezuela, according to a Telegraph reporter. \u201cMaduro, you murderer!\u201d one yelled. Opposition forces have pulled back after meeting fierce resistance when trying to get aid trucks across the border from Colombia over the Simon Bolivar bridge, per journalist Dylan Baddour. Opposition leader Juan Guaido charges that the Maduro regime has violated international law through its treatment of aid shipments. \u201cWe keep receiving support from the international community, which has been able to see, with its own eyes, how the usurper regime violates the Geneva convention, where it clearly says that destroying humanitarian aid is a crime against humanity,\u201d he said in a tweet. After Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro declared that he was ending diplomatic relations with Colombia, Colombian vice president Marta Lucia Ramirez shoots back that \u201cMaduro cannot break diplomatic relation that Colombia does not have with him.\u201d \u201cOur government has not named an ambassador there nor do we recognize Maduro\u2019s ambassador,\u201d she said. Colombia, along with other Latin American countries and the US and Europe, recognizes Juan Guaido as the country\u2019s legitimate president. \u201cHe is simply a dictator who occupies Miraflores by force,\u201d Ramirez wrote. The number of deserters from Venezuelan security forces is up to 23, Colombian officials tell Reuters. The defectors include two female officers of the national police, one member of the police Special Actions Force, or FAES, 18 National Guard members, and a driver of an armored car for the National Guard, Colombian immigration told journalist Maibort Petit. The FAES is the special police unit Nicolas Maduro has used to crush dissent. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of seeing my people suffering,\u201d William Camacho, the defector from that unit, said in a video posted by Petit. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go against my countrymen.\u201d US Vice President Mike Pence sent a message of support to Juan Guaido and the forces trying to get humanitarian aid into Venezuela. Emily Costa reports from Pacaraima, Brazil: Following reports of as many as four people killed during protests in the Venezuelan town of Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n, four Venezuelan indigenous people with gunshot wounds have entered Brazil and been taken to the hospital. Three are in the border town of Pacaraima and one has been taken to Boa Vista, state capital of Roraima. One had been hit four times. In a televised speech, Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro called the opposition trying to enter the country with humanitarian aid \u201ctraitors.\u201d He said he would accept aid if it was brought through legal channels, but called food aid attempting to entry the country carcinogenic and \u201crotten.\u201d Maduro told US president Donald Trump, who has recognized Juan Guaido as the country\u2019s legitimate president, to \u201cget your hands off Venezuela.\u201d \u201cI am stronger than ever,\u201d the embattled leader said to cheers from supporters. The non-profit group Foro Penal says that four people have now died in Santa Elena, the Venezuelan town near the border with Brazil. The group\u2019s director, Alberto Romero, called the situation \u201cextremely critical.\u201d National Guard troops have been seen opening fire in the town. Amid the chaos, president Nicolas Maduro is seen dancing on national TV. Three trucks of humanitarian aid are on fire, after Venezuelan forces fired teargas, according to video posted by TV network NTN24. Some boxes of medicine and medical supplies were salvaged from the fire, according to VPItv. Video shows people passing off boxes salvaged from the burning trucks. Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro is reportedly terminating formal diplomatic ties with Colombia and ordering the expulsion of its diplomatic staff from the country. A Miami Herald reporter puts the number of defectors from Venezuelan security forces today at at least 14. Trucks carrying humanitarian aid from Colombia have entered Venezuelan territory, opposition leader Juan Guaido says. But as at the Brazilian border, a border blockade of Venezuelan forces have stopped them from passing any further. Guaido also tweeted about female officers in the national police, who were shown on video crying as a protester appealed to them to let aid through, and who the opposition says have since defected. \u201cThey sent women to the front, thinking that we were going to attack them,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd all they accomplished was to show the world the face of Venezuelan mothers, who have the strength of crying the hunger of their children. They are with us now in Cucuta. Welcome to a free Venezuela!\u201d Emily Costa reports from Pacaraima, Brazil: Thomas Silva, a representative of Juan Guaid\u00f3\u2019s \u2018interim government\u2019 in Pacraraima, said the aid would enter Venezuela peacefully and that border guards would let it through. \u201cIt will go through peacefully, we\u2019re waiting for them to let us in,\u201d he said, adding that Venezuelans on the border were waiting for a \u2018committee\u2019 coming from Santa Elena de Uirar\u00e9n on the Venezuelan side of the border by car, on foot, or \u201cany other way\u201d before attempting to cross. \u201cThey are the ones negotiating,\u201d he said. Clavel Rangel reports: Another protester has been killed in southern Bol\u00edvar state, which so far has seen the worst bloodshed of the last two days. Jose Hernandez, 26, was shot in the border town of Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n. At least 18 others were injured. Local sources said the town hospital was overwhelmed by the numbers of wounded brought to them for treatment. Videos from the town showed national guard forces opening fire in the streets of the town, although it was not confirmed that they had killed Hernandez. Security forces had been trying to disperse local protesters since Friday evening. They were demonstrating against an attack by soldiers earlier that morning. The demonstrators, who at one point took over the airport and held 30 soldiers hostage, were also trying to prevent security forces reaching the border. The area is largely home to Pemon indigenous people, who have come out strongly in support of Guaid\u00f3 and the opposition. Two people died after being shot Friday by the Venezuelan military. There were also reports of pro-government armed gangs operating in a part of the border area, near the Roraima military base. Joe Parkin Daniels reports from Cucuta, Colombia: Volunteers are attempting to get aid across the Tienditas bridge, which connects Colombia and Venezuela. \u201cWe will advance! We are not afraid,\u201d said Nancy Barreto, speaking from a pickup truck to a group of a thousand volunteers and supporters. Volunteers waited in the baking sun just inside the Tienditas complex, some carrying white roses. Some organisers had brought flak jackets. \u201cEveryone feels fear, but from our fear we draw strength,\u201d said Manuel Solarte, a university professor from Caja Seca. \u201cToday is the end of the dictatorship \u2013 so can wait a few hours more.\u201d \u201cI am the voice of every pensioner in Venezuela without the food and medicine we need. And I come in peace, love and God,\u201d said Lucia Kulsky, who stood on the bridge clutching a white rose. \u201cI want to live in a country with hope, Venezuela isn\u2019t that country under Maduro,\u201d said student Ashley Guerrera, who traveled to the bridge with her friend Genesis Gonzalez this morning. \u201cOur brothers and sisters need medicine,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cWe are here to help them get it.\u201d Patricia Torres reports from anti-government protests in Caracas: Milagros Ortiz, 45, a doctor who lives in Catia, an area that was a traditional bastion of support for Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, said with tears in her eyes that in the hospital where she works, there wasn\u2019t enough medicine this week for a patient running a fever of 40C (104F). She was sitting by the border fence of the Carlota air base, but said she wasn\u2019t afraid of the soldiers, she was afraid her patients would keep dying. \u201cI\u2019m afraid to keep living this nightmare,\u201d she said. We don\u2019t have medicines, we don\u2019t have food, we don\u2019t have security.\u201d Ortiz said she didn\u2019t blame the soldiers. \u201cThey are not responsible, they are getting their orders from people who are corrupt.\u201d Legislator Manuela Bolivar asked people to stay calm and not to attack the fence around the base. She also told the protesters that if the military ask them to clear the area they should obey because \u201cwe don\u2019t want violence, we want peace. Violence is not part of our plan.\u201d Student Julio Cesar Ramos predicted that military forces would soon join the opposition. \u201cThis is a critical moment. There are many of us, and I am sure that they [the soldiers] are going to come over to our side,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are young, like me, and I ask them today to join us on the right side of history, and not make themselves responsible for the mistakes of their bosses.\u201d Andrea De Jes\u00fas, 30, an accountant, said her nine-year-old son who has Hunter syndrome has not received treatment in a year. \u201cI\u2019m here because there are so many families, that like mine, need medical help. Children are dying and we need the aid to come into the country now. I would beg the military today to please put their hand on their hearts. This isn\u2019t about politics, it\u2019s about human lives,\u201d she said. Many of the people marching were dressed in white, or wearing the Venezuelan national colours of red, yellow and blue. They carried banners and placards with messages begging for the passage of humanitarian aid. They shouted \u201cYes he can\u201d and \u201cWe are doing well\u201d. A huge crowd walked over 2km from Altamira district to the Carlota military airbase. Five police officers at the outskirts of the rally, who didn\u2019t want to be named, said they didn\u2019t plan to suppress or control the demonstration, but they were worried because they were sure that intelligence operatives were undercover in the crowd. Emily Costa reports from Pacaraima, Brazil: Yuretzi Idrogo, a deputy in Venezuela\u2019s national assembly, was on the border at Pacaraima on Saturday. She lives in Manaus, Brazil since going into exile last October, she said, after denouncing cases of children dying of hunger. \u201cI am here because we need to say to the soldiers that they need to let the aid pass,\u201d she said. \u201cThis aid needs to enter today and everything possible will be done so it does enter.\u201d She said there are four military blockades between the border and the Venezuelan town of Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay here helping until it\u2019s necessary and until the aid enters,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a deputy I demand that they respect our indigenous people.\u201d Trucks carrying aid attempted to cross the Tienditas and San Francisco de Paula bridges connecting Colombia with Venezuela and were met with \u201cstrong repression,\u201d according to tweets from national assembly member Yanet Fermin. She said at least six people were injured, including a a child. Three members of the Venezuelan national police who were seen in a video crying as a protester appealed to them to let humanitarian aid in have now defected, according to National Assembly member Yanet Fermin. Two Venezuelans injured in a confrontation with soldiers on Friday that killed two people and injured over a dozen are in a serious condition in hospital in Brazil, the government of Roraima state said on Saturday. Thirteen people crossed the border for hospital treatment \u2013 nine were treated at the Roraima general hospital in the state capital of Boa Vista, the government said in a statement, and another four in the border town of Pacaraima who were later released. Two people were hit by gunfire and killed after indigenous people in Kumarakapay stopped a military convoy heading for the border they believed was aiming to stop aid from entering. Kleber Perez is in intensive care and has firearm wounds to his thorax and abdomen with multiple wounds to his liver and intestine. Rolando Martinez is sedated and his breathing is being assisted. Lino Benavides is under observation with a moderate cranial trauma, five remain hospitalised and are in stable condition and one was released. Four other people were treated in Pacaraima and released, the state government said in a statement. Opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 met with the Venezuelan national guard members who defected today, according to a photo posted by national assembly member Freddy Guevara. Guevara called them \u201cmilitary patriots\u201d who \u201cput themselves on the side of the people and the constitution\u201d. \u201cBrothers in the armed forces, follow the example of your colleagues, Venezeula is waiting for you,\u201d he said in a tweet. Video from CNN shows a member of the Venezuelan national police silently crying as a volunteer appeals to her to let aid shipments in from Colombia. \u201cThink about your family, your children, every one of your relatives that can\u2019t get food,\u201d the man tells the female officers. \u201cYou are part of history. We are all one Venezuela...Do it for your children, for the sick, for all the children who are dying in the hospital this very day.\u201d Video shows Venezuelan security forces using tear gas against volunteers and opposition politicians who are trying to get the aid shipments across the border from Colombia, on the Simon Bolivar bridge. Venezuelans near the border with Brazil are holding flags as they await the hoped-for arrival of trucks carrying food and medicine. Additional members of the Venezuelan armed forces are defecting on the Simon Bolivar bridge, which connects Venezuela and Colombia. Marchers there approaching the border have been met with tear gas from security forces, journalist Dylan Baddour reports. US national security adviser John Bolton is urging the Venezuelan military to allow aid shipments to enter the country. The US, European and Latin American countries have recognized Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the president of Venezuela. \u201cPresident Guaido is personally leading the effort to bring aid to Venezuelan people. The military has a chance to protect and assist the people of Venezuela, not Maduro and a band of thieves,\u201d Bolton said in a tweet, accompanied by a photo of Guaid\u00f3 aboard an aid truck. \u201cChoose the road of democracy.\u201d Emily Costa reports from Pacaraima, Brazil: Victor Curvelo, 35, is the Venezuelan driver of one of the aid trucks parked at the Brazil-Venezuela border and lives in nearby Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n \u2013 a town just inside Venezuela. He said he spent two hours trying to fix a tire on route with the help of various people, which caused his delay arriving from Roraima state capital Boa Vista. He said he is a volunteer and is not being paid and entered Brazil on Friday with the truck via a clandestine route after trying to get past the blockade on the border. \u201cI did it because I want to help and every Venezuelan has to,\u201d he said. J\u00faris Cabrero, 57, who works for the city government in Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n, is another volunteer planning to help the aid truck get through. \u201cWe are waiting for people to arrive in Santa Elena to receive the aid. People are coming walking, by car, by bicycle,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope many people come here to accompany us and take the aid to the city. The trucks are in Venezuelan territory but we have yet to cross the blockades.\u201d The convoy of trucks carrying humanitarian aid to Venezuela from Colombia will be unloaded on the Colombian side of the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar bridge and transported by human chain across the border, Colombia\u2019s migration agency told Reuters. At the bridge, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Olivares urged military members to allow aid to cross. \u201cWe are going to get through. This is bigger than you and me, it\u2019s the health and the live of millions,\u201d he said, according to the New York Times. \u201cThe trucks are coming, and we are getting in.\u201d Armed gangs in San Antonio, Venezuela attacked journalists from the Venezuelan TV network Venevision, according to the national press workers\u2019 union. Journalist Marine Glod and her cameraman Orlando Uribe were accosted and their camera was taken from them, the group said in a tweet. Thousands of protesters are in the streets in Caracas around La Carlota military airport, calling for humanitarian aid to be allowed to enter the country. Leading media outlets on the Brazilian left have been rallying around the Venezuelan government on Saturday, following the example of Gleisi Hoffmann, president of the Workers\u2019 party founded by jailed former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who attended Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s inauguration in January. \u201cWe recognise the popular vote by which Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was elected,\u201d Hoffman said at the time. Brazilian leftist sites took a similar line, arguing that the humanitarian aid effort is a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d for US interests. On Saturday morning M\u00eddia Ninja, a widely-read, leftist news network with nearly half a million twitter followers, tweeted a Facebook post by Renato Janine Ribeiro \u2013 a professor of ethics and political philosophy at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and briefly education minister under Workers\u2019 party president Dilma Rousseff \u2013 with the instruction: \u201cReflect!\u201d \u201cWar with Venezuela seems imminent. Today is an invasion attempt under the pretext of humanitarian aid. Everybody knows I criticise Maduro. But that\u2019s a long way from backing Trumpo\u2019s invasion with the support of his South American servers. Because NONE of the so-called humanitarian invasions carried out by the USA improved the country invaded: Somalia, Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan,\u201d he posted. \u201cAnd that\u2019s without citing practically all the Latin American countries, which at one point it (the US) attacked.\u201d Leftist media network Jornalistas Livres \u2013 or Free Journalists \u2013 posted a similar line from Caracas on its Facebook site, which has over a million followers, and linked to a video attacking the aid. \u201cHUMANITARIAN AID TO VENEZUELA IS A TROJAN HORSE,\u201d it said. \u201cToday, 23 of February, is the day when the coup monger Juan Guaid\u00f3, who declared himself president of the republic, marked for \u2018humanitarian aid\u2019 to forcibly enter Venezuela. It\u2019s worth remembering that if the USA really wanted to help Venezuela, it would be enough to unblock the accounts of the government and the state oil company PDVSA, because 95 percent of the government\u2019s income depends on money from oil exports.\u201d The Facebook page of leftist site O Cafezinho (The Little Coffee), which has 492,000 followers, posted a video on Saturday from a vegetable market in Caracas with produce visible on the stalls. \u201cThis is a traditional market that happens here in Caracas. The people are on the street, doing their shopping, and life goes on as normal,\u201d said reporter Caio Cl\u00edmaco. \u201cWorth remembering that the war only interests the United States and the Venezuelan opposition.\u201d He did not interview anybody in the market. DMC (Diario do Centro do Mundo \u2013 Diary from the Centre of the World), another independent leftist site - shared a timeline of what described as increasing involvement by the United States in Venezuelan affairs in 2019. The piece was headlined: \u201cHow the USA and the Lima Group turned Venezuela into a barrel of gunpowder.\u201d Emily Costa reports from the Venezuela-Brazil border: Although a truck carrying aid has technically crossed onto Venezuelan territory, it is on the Brazilian side of a border blockade. The truck has not passed customs, and remains blocked by a blockade of Venezuelan national guard. A second truck has also arrived and parked next to the first one in the border area. As aid convoys departed from Colombia, Colombian president Iv\u00e1n Duque has demanded the supplies be allowed to enter. \u201cWe demand that it be permitted to pass in a peaceful manner into Venezuelan territory for the benefit of those who need it,\u201d he said, according to video posted by a journalist, adding that to impede the shipment would be an offense against human rights and could constitute a \u201ccrime\u201d under human rights law. If the aid is denied entry, he said, \u201cthe usurper Nicol\u00e1s Maduro will be responsible for any act of violence\u201d. Hillary Clinton is urging Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to allow humanitarian aid to enter the country peacefully. \u201cPeople are in need of life-saving medicines, children are subsisting on one meal a day, and a peaceful delivery of food and supplies is to the benefit of all,\u201d the former US secretary of state and 2016 presidential candidate said in a tweet. The first shipment of humanitarian aid has successfully crossed the border into Venezuela from Brazil, opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 says in a tweet. \u201cThis is a great accomplishment, Venezuela!\u201d he said. A convoy carrying humanitarian aid has departed for the Venezuelan border from warehouses in Colombia. Opposition president Juan Guaido is aboard one of the trucks. \u201cThe moment is now: From this instant begins the mobilization of president Juan Guaido toward the Venezuelan border, and thus begin all the mobilizations of the country,\u201d the National Assembly wrote in a tweet. Opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 is guaranteeing amnesty to members of the military and security forces who defect, according to video posted by journalist Mariana Reyes. Protesters along Venezuela\u2019s border with Colombia have stolen a red city bus and set it on fire to express outrage over thwarted humanitarian aid deliveries, the Associated Press reports: Flames from the bus blaze in the border town of Urena also caused nearby power lines to spark. Protests broke out early in the day as opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 vowed to move in emergency food and medicine from the United States over objections from President Nicola\u00e1s Maduro. But Guaid\u00f3 and other opposition leaders showed no immediate signs of being able to get the aid from a warehouse in C\u00facuta, Colombia to Venezuela. A demonstrator in Caracas tells VPI TV that police there have also deployed tear gas against marchers, telling them that they didn\u2019t have a permit to march. Clashes have intensified in Urena, on the Venezuelan side of the border with Colombia. Venezuela\u2019s national guard fired tear gas on residents clearing a barricaded border bridge between Venezuela and Colombia. A military outpost near the Venezuela-Brazil border has been taken over by a pro-regime militia, according to VPI TV. Members of the anti-regime national assembly are inside. Clavel Rangel reports from Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela: A second Venezuelan has died from injuries inflicted by the Venezuelan military, when they opened fire on indigenous protesters on Friday. Rolando Garcia had spent the night in intensive care in Brazil, before dying on Saturday morning from his injuries. He was shot while trying to shield his wife, Zoraida Rodriguez, who died soon after the shooting. Both had gunshot injuries to their abdomen. They had not joined the protest, but their house is just beside where the clashes broke out, and they were hit there by stray bullets. Garcia had worked as a guide in the Gran Sabana area, one of the country\u2019s most spectacular and a popular draw for tourists. His employer, the ecotourism NGO Apetoy Tours, remembered him as an \u201cexemplary guide.\u201d \u201cRest in peace Rolando Garcia ... never again a horror like this,\u201d they wrote on Twitter. Four members of the Venezuelan National Guard have defected this morning along the border with Colombia. Three defected at the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar bridge and a fourth guardsman defected on another border bridge, a Colombian immigration official told AFP. A Spectator reporter tweeted a photo of the four guardsmen who deserted their posts and crossed into Colombian territory. \u201cToday begins the real breakdown of Maduro\u2019s regime,\u201d Cliver Alcal\u00e1, a retired general who has joined the opposition, told reporters in Cucuta, according to the Wall Street Journal. \u201cIt will mark a tipping point.\u201d Anggy Polanco reports from Tachira, Venezuela on the \u201cWomen in White\u201d who have been leading protests at the border with Colombia: Venezuela has closed the border with Colombia before. One closure lasted for nearly a year, until the blockade was broken by a newly organised group of protesters known as \u201cthe women in white\u201d. They have grown into a powerful force in Tachira state, and are back at the front of border protests on Saturday, forming a human chain to get food and medicines stockpiled by the opposition into Venezuela, in defiance of a government ban. \u201cThis aid must cross,\u201d said Lucero Valero, 37, an accountant currently working as a manicurist, and one of the main leaders of the movement. The women first came together over frustration over shortages of medicine, food and basic hygiene and cleaning products, easily available in Colombia but already scarce and expensive in Venezuela. \u201cIt began because one woman needed a prescription that she couldn\u2019t find anywhere, and that led to our organisation,\u201d said Valero, who joined a group of around 80 women at the border in late June 2016. They were turned away by the military on that attempt, but instead of being discouraged persuaded 700 women, all dressed in white, to join a second attempt on 5 July. This time they succeed in breaking through two military cordons on the San Francisco international bridge, and reached Colombia so they could buy what they needed. Claudia Perez was key to the success of that protest. Her husband had been stranded on the Colombian side of the border when it closed, and her two daughters, then three- and 15-years-old, were with her in Venezuela. She took her two girls along to the bridge and told her youngest to remove the barrier blocking the crossing, while she pleaded with soldiers, telling them that her daughters didn\u2019t have milk and she was on her period and needed sanitary supplies. The commander of the military blockade eventually let her through, and after that the rest of the group managed to push forward, heading to Colombia. \u201cIt really touched the hearts of the soldiers, there was no aggression. The strategy was to talk to them as mother and daughter,\u201d Perez remembers. \u201cNo one believed we could do it, but we succeed.\u201d Valero says that today the group is more than 1000 strong, and includes women of all ages and backgrounds, from housewives to professionals, and across the political spectrum. Some are even Chavistas who supported former president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez but are frustrated they can no longer get daily necessities. The group is focused on helping families meet their daily needs and aims to stay away from political movements. They were attacked as black-marketeers by a former regional governor, but have also refused to wear T-shirts with the face of an opposition leader. Although it doesn\u2019t currently have any official status, they hope to establish it a charity in future, with a focus on the reconstruction of Venezuela and help for those who need it. \u201cWe want a return to the beautiful Venezuela we knew, where he could get what we needed without having to cross the border.\u201d Emily Costa reports from Pacaraima, Brazil: Maria Belandria, Juan Guaid\u00f3\u2019s \u2018ambassador\u2019 to Brazil, recognised by the Brazilian government as the country\u2019s official representative here, went to the border after Saturday morning\u2019s press conference and talked to some of the Venezuelans gathered there. \u201cThis aid has to arrive. We have Venezuelans waiting for this aid. These [soldiers] have to put their hands on their hearts because this aid goes to them too,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hope the guards open up, as happened in Colombia. This is the hope.\u201d Emma Graham-Harrison and Patricia Torres report from Caracas: In Caracas, opposition supporters are gathering for a march to La Carlotta, a military airport in the capital. They plan to ask soldiers there to defect, and let the aid through, although the latter would be a mostly symbolic decision as no aid is expected to arrive here. The crowd for now is about 1,000 strong, many wearing white, and carrying Venezuelan flags or wearing caps with the national red, blue and yellow. One demostrator, his body painted in national colours, knelt with a sign saying \u201cFor a free Venezuela, for all the fallen, and for our brothers \u2013 may God bless them.\u201d Pro-government forces are also planning rallies in the centre of Caracas. Top Maduro ally Diosdado Cabello implied the government would let individuals carrying aid cross the border, but \u201cno foreign soldier would put a foot inside Venezuela\u201d. Some of the worst violence so far has been in the Venezuelan town of Urena, where protestors stormed a school that security forces were using as a base, stripped some of their uniforms and burned them. They also seized a bus that pro-government organisers had used to bring supporters to the area, and drove it towards the border crossing. In Urena, on the Venezuelan side of the border with Colombia, guardsmen used tear gas to repel marchers from Venezuela\u2019s Women in White, a religious group, according to Bloomberg News. The protesters were rallying people to a border barricade. Three members of the Venezeulan security forces have deserted on the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar bridge, which connects Venezuela with Colombia, the Spectator reports. A sergeant with the Venezuelan police who deserted said many other members of the security forces oppose the government, but are too afraid to leave. \u201cThere is fear, because there you cant talk, you cant say anything against the government,\u201d he said. \u201cI had the courage that many of my colleagues have not had.\u201d The man said he had been thinking about his decision for days. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something I decided overnight,\u201d he said. He called on other members of the security forces to join him, saying that millions of Venezuelans are pitted against a small circle of loyalists to Maduro. At a press conference in the border town of Pacaraima on Saturday morning, Brazil\u2019s foreign minister said the effort to transport aid into Venezuela was well planned. \u201cThis is not an improvised thing. It happened very quickly but it is totally professional,\u201d he said, adding that he hoped the aid effort would continue. \u201cBrazil is ready to continue with this cooperation, as well as the United States and the Lima Group. We want this to be the first movement,\u201d he said, referring to a group of Latin American countries that have backed the Venezuelan opposition. \u201cWe continue hoping that China and Russia and other countries become aware.\u201d Seated beside him, Maria Belandria, appointed by Guaid\u00f3 as \u201cambassador\u201d to Brazil, said they wanted the aid to enter Venezuela and wanted to send a \u201cgreeting to the companions who are on the other side of the border\u201d. In the early hours of Saturday morning she tweeted a video alongside Ara\u00fajo \u2013 who also features on her Twitter profile photo \u2013 and US charge d\u2019affaires William Popp, standing in a warehouse in Boa Vista in front of sacks of supplies. \u201cWe are here with more than 200 tons of medicine and food. Thanks to Brazil, thanks to the United States,\u201d she said. Two trucks left Boa Vista, capital of this northernmost state of Roraima, early on Saturday under escort but so far just one has arrived in the border town. The other burst a tire while on route and is due this morning. The first truck got close to the border but then turned around. \u201cThere are many people here,\u201d said the Guardian\u2019s Emily Costa in Pacaraima. She said the truck \u201cmoved close to the border, then turned around and went back. Everyone thought it would enter.\u201d The trucks are carrying first aid kits, rice and powdered milk, the G1 site reported. The border remains closed. Protests are underway on the Venezuelan side of the border with Colombia, in the city of Urena. Protesters stormed a school occupied by a government militia, according to a New York Times reporter. Some of the militia members joined forces with the protesters. One militia member was seriously injured after falling while trying to escape. A peaceful march was planned in an attempt to diffuse tensions. Joe Parkin Daniels reports from Cucuta, Colombia: Venezuelans have been arriving in the Colombian border town of Cucuta to help shift aid across the border Lizmar Vergara, 22, who lives in Caja Seca, arrived yesterday. \u201cI\u2019m here for the freedom of our country. It\u2019s the most precious, the most beautiful thing. Venezuela is magical and I will never leave so I\u2019m here for its future,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not scared because when they take your bravery they take your freedom. If they shoot at us we carry on, the freedom of Venezuela demands it.\u201d \u201cYou smell that morning air? That is the smell of freedom,\u201d said Nancy Barreto, an activist from from Portuguesa state. She crossed the border yesterday to help shift aid across. Hundreds slept outside Friday night, without tents, and sang the national anthem as dawn broke Some opposition members have gathered at the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar bridge, which connects Colombia with Venezuela, chanting: \u201cLibertad, libertad.\u201d The first trucks have arrived in Pacaraima, on the Brazilian side of the border, carrying aid meant to cross over into Venezuela. Brazil\u2019s foreign minister tweeted a photo with Juan Guaid\u00f3 from the aid concert in Cucuta, Colombia, Friday night. \u201cStill in C\u00facuta, Colombia, with the Interim President of Venezuela, Juan Guaid\u00f3, courageous leader of the democratic transition. Guaid\u00f3 sent greetings and his effusive thanks to President Bolsonaro and to Brazil for the support for a free Venezuela,\u201d he wrote. Here\u2019s a dispatch from Emily Costa, who is in Pacaraima on the Brazilian side of the border: Even with the border between Venezuela and Brazil closed since Thursday night on the orders of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Venezuelans have continued to cross into Brazil in the Northern state of Roraima, walking for hours along clandestine trails. One group of seven people, including two children, arrived on Friday night at around 7pm, after walking for two hours. \u201cWe got a taxi to the trail and then we started walking,\u201d said Antonio Isea, 33, an electrical engineer from Barquisimeto. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t stay there, we had to get to the end of it, it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d Both he and Maria Eugenia Sosa, 34, another electrical engineer from Caracas, were headed for Argentina. \u201cWe were tired but we had to keep going because we already have tickets to carry on the journey,\u201d she said. The group were waiting to register with the Brazilian authorities on Saturday morning. Venezuelans entering said security has been enforced and there are more national guard securing the border and even guarding these secret routes. \u201cI was scared. I had never been through anything like this in my life,\u201d said Clenni Morales, 32, an administrator from Puerto Ordaz who was carrying her five-year-old daughter. Jonas Broer, 33, an industrial engineer traveling with his son of five said he was also scared. \u201cI walked a little and felt safer,\u201d he said. Venezuelans have begun gathering on the Brazilian side of the border in Pacaraima, holding placards made out of cardboard, ready to help. Maritz Ca\u00f1a, 46, was among them. She is unemployed and used to live in Ciudad Bol\u00edvar but migrated to Pacaraima a year ago because of the crisis. \u201cI want to face the struggle for Venezuela, to return to my country,\u201d she said. \u201cI want everything to happen peacefully. I am ready to go walking and carry the aid to the other side. We want the aid to enter, for the people who are dying from hunger, from the lack of medicine. All of us need this.\u201d Good morning. Today in Venezuela, opposition leaders are trying to get shipments of aids into the country, defying a ban by the government in Caracas. Tensions are high on the country\u2019s borders with Colombia and Brazil. Opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 has vowed to cross into the country with thousands of volunteers carrying food and medical supplies. Venezuelan security forces loyal to the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro have been ordered not to let them through. The Guardian has correspondents on the ground in Venezuela, Colombia and Brazil, and we\u2019ll be bringing you developments as they unfold throughout the day. Venezuelans have suffered from years of shortages of food and medicine as the country has been engulfed in an economic crisis. The showdown over aid shipments turned deadly on Friday when a military convoy headed for the southern border with Brazil opened fire on indigenous protesters blocking their way, killing one person and injuring 16. Police fired tear gas on Saturday after clashes broke out among Venezuelans trying to cross into Colombia. The government has closed the border to block shipments of aid. Guaid\u00f3, who has declared himself interim president of Venezuela and is recognized by the United States and Europe, defied a travel ban imposed on him by the government and traveled to the town of C\u00facuta, on the Colombian side of the border, where he appeared at a star studded aid concert on Friday night. The presidents of Chile, Colombia and Paraguay all came to the concert, and tons of aid have been stockpiled in the Colombian town.",

      "bodyText": "At least four people have been killed and hundreds injured in a wave of violence that convulsed Venezuela\u2019s border regions on Saturday, as opposition activists tried to defy a government ban to bring food and medical supplies into the country. After the failed attempt to breach government blockades, opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 declared the fight would continue, and said \u201cwe must keep all our options open for the liberation of our homeland\u201d. He will head to Bogot\u00e1 for a meeting on Monday with US vice-president Mike Pence, and other regional leaders in the Lima Group. Florida senator Marco Rubio responded to Guaid\u00f3\u2019s comments, saying he had spoken to regional leaders. He said President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s regime on Saturday had \u201copened the door to various potential multilateral actions not on the table just 24 hours ago\u201d. Although Guaid\u00f3 did not secure the mass defections he had hoped for, at least 60 border guards deserted their posts and fled into Colombia, as other members of security forces loyal to Maduro used teargas and rubber bullets to force back protesters and halt civilian convoys escorting aid supplies. Three trucks of aid caught fire as they approached the first border checkpoints at the Santander and Sim\u00f3n Bolivar bridges connecting Venezuela to Colombia. It is not clear how those fires were started. There were injuries on both sides of the crossing, with Colombian authorities reporting at least 285 wounded. In the south, opposition activists claimed aid had reached Venezuela, but although two trucks did leave Brazil they stopped just a few metres inside the border, a national guard checkpoint between them and any possible recipients. Beyond the security forces was the town of Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n, which saw the worst of the violence, with both pro-government armed gangs and national guard members taking to the streets to try and disperse opposition supporters. At least four people were killed and 18 injured by gunfire, according to campaign group Foro Penal, and the town\u2019s hospital was overwhelmed by the influx of dead and injured. The first casualty of the aid delivery attempt had come in the same area on Friday, when a military convoy opened fire on indigenous protesters. Humanitarian aid is much-needed in a country racked by hunger, hyperinflation and food shortages. But opposition leaders also hope their attempt to deliver supplies will undermine Maduro and encourage defections from security forces that have largely remained loyal to Caracas. Maduro addressed a rally in the capital, insisting he was \u201cstronger than ever\u201d and calling volunteers trying to ship aid \u201ctraitors\u201d. He denounced the food and medical supplies as an American pretext to destabilise his government, and told the crowd he had broken off diplomatic relations with Colombia because the country was being used for \u201cattacks against Venezuela\u201d. After his speech, as teargas billowed at the country\u2019s borders, he danced with his wife onstage in a bizarre display of nonchalance. Guaid\u00f3, who had declared himself interim president in late January, had claimed a premature victory at about noon local time, announcing that the first aid had already crossed the border from Brazil. But they went only a few metres inside Venezuela, and by evening the two small trucks loaded with donations had driven back into Brazil, citing security concerns. By the end of Saturday, which the opposition had made a deadline for aid shipments to cross the border, it appeared the two sides had settled into an uneasy standoff. Colombia announced late on Saturday that it would close all the border crossings for two days, to check for damage after attempts to take aid across were met with fierce violence. The most serious clashes were on the Santander bridge separating C\u00facuta and the Venezuelan town of Ure\u00f1a. There volunteers escorted aid trucks up to a security cordon but were pushed back by rubber bullets and teargas, while gangs loyal to Maduro and opposition supporters threw stones at each other. \u201cI was crossing the bridge when a rubber bullet hit me,\u201d said Carlos Juancho, a student from Merida, wounded in the neck. \u201cThis is how Maduro treats his people.\u201d The opposition perhaps thought civilian convoys would test how far ordinary soldiers were willing to go to protect the government. Whatever their orders, many were expected to be uneasy about opening fire on unarmed fellow Venezuelans. There were at least 60 members of security forces in the area who crossed the border they were ordered to defend, Colombian immigration officials said. Guaid\u00f3 took to Twitter to encourage others to join them. \u201cIn my position as commander in chief of the armed forces, I declare that soldiers who cross the border will not be considered traitors to their homeland,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 said in a tweet. But there were not enough defections to allow aid to pass the border crossings. Although Guaid\u00f3 has won a wave of popular support and been recognised as Venezuela\u2019s leader by the US and many of its allies, he has so far struggled to persuade the country\u2019s military to back his cause en masse. Promotions and lucrative commercial opportunities have helped keep senior officers loyal, while many in the lower ranks are terrified of being punished for defection. One of the defectors who crossed on Saturday said it had taken courage to leave. \u201cBrother, I have been thinking about this for days,\u201d he said, in a video shared on social media. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something I decided overnight.\u201d Many others in the security forces agreed with him but were too afraid to defect, he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t say anything against the government.\u201d Friday\u2019s attack near the Brazil border suggested the military were under heavy pressure from senior officers. Local officials said the attack was the first time in living memory the armed forces had opened fire on indigenous people in the Gran Sabana area, a tourism hotspot famous for spectacular scenery. The violence began again early on Saturday on the other side of the country, police firing teargas at Venezuelans trying to cross into Colombia in Ure\u00f1a. Most were not protesters but simply heading across for work or personal reasons. \u201cWe are frightened that what happened yesterday at the other border is going to happen here, with people killed and injured,\u201d said Aurora Albarracin, 55. Later in the day, protests in towns on the Venezuelan side of the border also turned violent, with protesters throwing stones and bottles, burning military uniforms and setting a government bus on fire, and riot police responding with teargas. Armed pro-government gangs also opened fire on civilians in the town of San Antonio, wounding at least 11 people. Rallies around the country aimed to persuade soldiers that they could switch sides. In Caracas, marchers headed for the Carlota military airport in the heart of the city. \u201cI would tell the soldiers today: put reason and feeling ahead of your weapons,\u201d said Daniel Bruce, an intensive care doctor who said his hospital didn\u2019t have basic medical supplies. \u201cYou are also Venezuelans and you suffer the same as us when you go to the hospitals,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m marching because I believe in the rebirth of my homeland, and I believe that my patients have a right to humanitarian aid. Today is not about ideology, it is about human lives and dignity.\u201d Additional reporting by Dom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro, Patricia Torres in Caracas and Emily Costa in Pacaraima \u2022 This article was amended on 24 February 2019. An earlier version said the three aid trucks that caught fire were set on fire by teargas grenades, but it is not clear how the fires started.",

Unlike gender and age, mood is harder to determine, sitting at around 80% accuracy.</p> <p>There are now more than 1,600 billboards installed into 41 Westfield centres across Australia and New Zealand. Scentre Group, Westfield Australia\u2019s parent company, emphasises that all data collected is anonymous<strong> </strong>and that they are using facial detection, not facial recognition technology (FRT).</p> <p>This means generic information such as a shopper\u2019s age and gender is collected rather than the technology using photo-matching databases to identify who customers are. A spokesperson would not confirm whether or not Westfield would consider using FRT in the future.</p> <p>Retail companies are increasingly turning to facial detection and facial recognition software to attract and engage a distracted audience. Quividi\u2019s host of international clients include Telstra, 7-Eleven, Coca-Cola, oOH Media and HSBC bank.</p> <p>Terry Hartmann, vice president of Cognitec Asia Pacific, the company that develops \u201cmarket-leading face recognition technologies for customers and government agencies around the world\u201d, says using facial detection commercially is no different to Facebook\u2019s manipulation of users\u2019 online search history for targeted advertising.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not identifying who that person is, you\u2019re just identifying the characteristics of that person.

He says that under optimum lighting and using high-quality photo data bases, FRT is more accurate than humans at identifying faces and can now recognise an individual from millions of photographs.</p> <p>According to Xu, the technology is even more reliable at identifying criminals \u2013 and presumably other people \u2013 than using fingerprints.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/14/drones-dna-and-data-please-dont-give-the-gift-of-privacy-invasion\">Drones, DNA and data: please don't give the gift of privacy invasion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This technology is still in its teething stages within the Australian retail sector, but FRT has significant investment and growth potential.

The global FRT market is worth approximately US$3bn (A$4.1bn) and is expected to grow to US$6bn by 2021. Target and Walmart say they trialed the technology in-store to prevent theft and fraud, while 7-Eleven plan to use it to \u201cidentify loyal customers\u201d.

In these stores shoppers can buy products by simply scanning their faces, while in ATMS and hotels, all it takes is a glance to check in and take out money.

      "bodyText": "If you shop at Westfield, you\u2019ve probably been scanned and recorded by dozens of hidden cameras built into the centres\u2019 digital advertising billboards. The semi-camouflaged cameras can determine not only your age and gender but your mood, cueing up tailored advertisements within seconds, thanks to facial detection technology. Westfield\u2019s Smartscreen network was developed by the French software firm Quividi back in 2015. Their discreet cameras capture blurry images of shoppers and apply statistical analysis to identify audience demographics. And once the billboards have your attention they hit record, sharing your reaction with advertisers. Quividi says their billboards can distinguish shoppers\u2019 gender with 90% precision, five categories of mood from \u201cvery happy to very unhappy\u201d and customers\u2019 age within a five-year bracket. Mood is a particularly valuable insight for advertisers, revealing shoppers\u2019 general sentiment towards a brand and how they feel in particular stores at certain times of the day. Unlike gender and age, mood is harder to determine, sitting at around 80% accuracy. There are now more than 1,600 billboards installed into 41 Westfield centres across Australia and New Zealand. Scentre Group, Westfield Australia\u2019s parent company, emphasises that all data collected is anonymous and that they are using facial detection, not facial recognition technology (FRT). This means generic information such as a shopper\u2019s age and gender is collected rather than the technology using photo-matching databases to identify who customers are. A spokesperson would not confirm whether or not Westfield would consider using FRT in the future. Retail companies are increasingly turning to facial detection and facial recognition software to attract and engage a distracted audience. Quividi\u2019s host of international clients include Telstra, 7-Eleven, Coca-Cola, oOH Media and HSBC bank. Terry Hartmann, vice president of Cognitec Asia Pacific, the company that develops \u201cmarket-leading face recognition technologies for customers and government agencies around the world\u201d, says using facial detection commercially is no different to Facebook\u2019s manipulation of users\u2019 online search history for targeted advertising. \u201cYou\u2019re not identifying who that person is, you\u2019re just identifying the characteristics of that person. That\u2019s no different to Facebook popping up ads you might be interested in and social media picking up people based on their clicking habits or the shopping that they\u2019ve done.\u201d While facial detection could be considered relatively benign, it is a step closer to the more problematic FRT. Dr Dong Xu is the chair in computer engineering at the University of Sydney. He says that under optimum lighting and using high-quality photo data bases, FRT is more accurate than humans at identifying faces and can now recognise an individual from millions of photographs. According to Xu, the technology is even more reliable at identifying criminals \u2013 and presumably other people \u2013 than using fingerprints. This technology is still in its teething stages within the Australian retail sector, but FRT has significant investment and growth potential. International companies including Target, 7-Eleven, Walmart, Google and Facebook are all experimenting with facial recognition. The global FRT market is worth approximately US$3bn (A$4.1bn) and is expected to grow to US$6bn by 2021. Target and Walmart say they trialed the technology in-store to prevent theft and fraud, while 7-Eleven plan to use it to \u201cidentify loyal customers\u201d. Facebook has been using facial recognition since December 2017 to help users \u201cmanage their identity online\u201d while Google has also been using FRT for some time. China is the world\u2019s leader in facial recognition, with more than 176m CCTV cameras. FRT is used for street surveillance and policing but also in China\u2019s \u201ccashless\u201d stores. In these stores shoppers can buy products by simply scanning their faces, while in ATMS and hotels, all it takes is a glance to check in and take out money. Alibaba and Guess are now experimenting with a project called FashionAI. The project would fit FRT into changing room mirrors, allowing customers to see themselves in outfits without actually having to put them on. FRT has a number of beneficial uses. In Canada, it has been used to help those who have identified themselves as problem gamblers. In a number of international airports, the technology is used to speed up checking in and security procedures. And in Australia, it has long been employed by border security at the arrival gates and in national policing efforts to detect suspects from criminal watch lists. But there are major concerns about how to protect the privacy of those whose data is collected. In January a coalition of 85 civil rights groups wrote to Microsoft, Amazon and Google demanding the companies commit not to sell face surveillance technology to governments. When asked, Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, rejected the idea of an outright ban, saying: \u201cA sweeping ban on all government use clearly goes too far and risks being cruel in its humanitarian effect.\u201d He was referring to the reported use of the technology to detect rare diseases and also reunite missing children in India. But Microsoft has acknowledged the concerns about FRT and called for greater government regulation of the use of this technology. In a December 2018 Microsoft blogpost, Smith identified three main problems governments needed to address, namely the risk of bias and discrimination, new intrusions into privacy, and the potential for mass surveillance to \u201cencroach on democratic freedoms\u201d.

      "body": "<p>When she was a child Tricia Walsh used to hide under her bed. She knew she wasn\u2019t safe from anyone who came into the house. She was sexually abused by her father from an early age. Her mother was a violent alcoholic. \u201cShe was so drunk she didn\u2019t know who was coming in and out of my bedroom.\u201d</p> <p>By the age of 12 she had been sexually abused multiple times by relatives and the people who came to her parents\u2019 party house. \u201cI learned that I deserved having my head smashed into the floor, that I must have deserved to have my leg pulled from under my bed. To me it was normal. But they all took something from me that couldn\u2019t be put back together again.\u201d</p> <p>At 12 she attempted to take her own life, at 13 she dropped out of school and fled \u201cinto the arms\u201d of a notorious bikie gang. To numb the pain she started taking drugs. \u201cI became addicted to everything that was out there.\u201d She had her first child at 15 and three more by the time she was 19. When her first child was six months old, Walsh began her prison journey. There would be six more prison sentences over the next 20 years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/27/i-grew-up-with-a-mother-behind-bars-but-her-innocence-wasnt-the-only-lie-i-was-sold\">I grew up with a mother behind bars.

Walsh was 44 by the time she started putting herself back together, and graduated valedictorian for a social work degree at university. All those wasted years.</p> <p>As confronting as it is, Walsh\u2019s story is not an unusual account of a woman\u2019s trajectory into the prison system. It is not even the worst story, but it is a common story.</p> <p>According to research by Sisters Inside, an advocacy group for women in prison, up to 90% of women in prison have been sexually abused and 98% have experienced violence. Emeritus professor Judy Atkinson, a Jiman/Bundjalung woman who has researched women in prisons for decades, says she has never encountered anyone in prison who has not had a violent childhood. She believes 100% of prisoners have a \u201cclear diagnosis of complex trauma\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Time stops when you go through those prison gates. You are taught nothing, you go brain dead</p> <footer> <cite>Kymberley Ranganui, former inmate</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At a time when the crime rate in many Australian states has dropped, we have the highest rate of incarceration, with an overrepresentation of women, 34% of whom are Indigenous. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the general <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4512.0Main+Features1September%20quarter%202018?OpenDocument\">rate for women going into the prison system</a> rose by 10% in the year to September 2018.</p> <p>These women are often predestined for prison from an early age, they have been treated as worthless, they had no chance. At the Sisters Inside conference in Brisbane last November, the stories told by former prisoners all spoke of brutality that started in early childhood, drugs and alcohol as teenagers, institutionalisation, juvenile detention; historical violence that has snowballed down the generations all the way from colonisation.</p> <p>According to the Sisters Inside founder, Debbie Kilroy, prison has become a place for warehousing people with mental illness, disability and substance abuse. \u201cWe know,\u201d says Kilroy, \u201cthat the issues that present for women in prison are about poverty and homelessness. Prison is the default response for poverty, homelessness, mental health, drug addiction, abused women.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that many women in prison can\u2019t even read or write. The incarceration of Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal women has increased 640% in the last 20 years and they are the ones who are the most brutalised.\u201d</p> <p>According to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner, June Oscar, it is a system which \u201cpunishes people for poverty\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d64243b9a90e2ba8a0a31774f12ced9a89cc638b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d64243b9a90e2ba8a0a31774f12ced9a89cc638b/0_0_2454_3564/689.jpg\" alt=\"Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice commissioner June Oscar\" width=\"689\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner June Oscar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>April Long, the national program manager of Shine for Kids, which works with the children of prisoners, says: \u201cThe criminal justice system is full of the women and men who need the most healing and support.\u201d These are women, she says, for whom the world has never been a safe place. Women who are punished over and over again.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we do when multiple systems have failed them,\u201d says Long, \u201cincluding education and health, is that we end up incarcerating them and victimise them even more.\u201d</p> <p>Kymberley Ranganui, now 36, was only 15 when she first went to prison. After suffering childhood abuse she would be in and out for the next 20 years on drug offences.</p> <p>\u201cTime stops when you go through those prison gates,\u201d she says. \u201cYou are taught nothing, you go brain dead.</p> <p>\u201cYou become so institutionalised that you start believing that system is the only place you exist, the only place you matter, you believe these women are your sisters, you can\u2019t adapt to society, you are a product of your own environment.\u201d</p> <p>She says the recidivism rate is high because women come out and are given no support, \u201cnot even a voucher\u201d, and \u201cgo back to their old ways\u201d because they \u201ccan\u2019t cope and don\u2019t know how to do it. They go fuck it, and sometimes go back purposefully.\u201d</p> <p>Ranganui\u2019s son Jakob was only a month old when she was given a two-year sentence at the age of 25. \u201cThey didn\u2019t take anything into consideration, my past history or my pregnancy. I had reports, psychologists coming in with me,\u201d she says.</p> <p>With leaking breasts, on \u201can emotional rollercoaster, I was breaking down, my hormones were everywhere, it is not good physically, mentally, emotionally, having to do a sentence, having to worry about my baby\u201d while she fought both her sentence and to have her son in prison with her. It took six months of anguish to get her child.</p> <p>\u201cIt is in a child\u2019s best interests to be with their mother. Can\u2019t we figure out another way? Why not do a sentence out in the community?\u201d</p> <p>When Ranganui came out of prison with an 18-month-old son, \u201cI was on my own, I didn\u2019t even have food for him or any parenting programs.\u201d</p> <h2>Domestic violence a major cause of women\u2019s incarceration</h2> <p>While no one disputes that violent offenders should be in prison, most women are in prison for relatively minor crimes that come from substance abuse, poverty and desperation.</p> <p>Kilroy points to tough new bail laws women who are on remand, due to the tough new bail laws, because they have been involved in domestic violence but who will not get a custodial sentence.</p> <p>\u201cTwenty per cent of the women on remand are in prison for that. Some of them don\u2019t even have a criminal history or they have a very minor criminal history, but they are languishing in prison on remand for months. By then she has lost the house, the kids, a job, property. You never get any of that back.\u201d</p> <p>Domestic violence directly or indirectly is a major cause of women being incarcerated. Directly when she finally retaliates or indirectly when there is, say, financial abuse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/23/crowdfunding-campaign-to-free-indigenous-women-shocked-by-wa-government-response\">Crowdfunding campaign to free Indigenous women 'shocked' by WA government response</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThen you might offend so you can feed your children or pay for their school uniforms. A woman traumatised by constant violence can starting drinking or using drugs to self-medicate,\u201d says Dr Samantha Jeffries from the School of Criminal Justice at Griffith University.</p> <p>When the police turn up to an incident they can put an order on both people without differentiating who the perpetrator is, or can mistake the victim for the aggressor. \u201cHe is calm,\u201d says Kilroy, \u201cit is \u2018good mate, how are you, mate\u2019, he is a good bloke, you know. She is crying and hysterical and can\u2019t keep it together.\u201d Or she may have breached bail conditions because she changed address in running from a violent situation or be homeless because of it and is not aware of a court date.</p> <p>When a lawyer seeking mitigation for sentencing asks if they have experienced domestic violence, a woman will often say no. Says associate professor Katherine McFarlane of Charles Sturt University: \u201cIf all you have ever known is exploitation and abuse it is not seen as domestic violence. It is normalised.\u201d They can also be protecting the kids who may be with the perpetrator.</p> <p>According to Long, up to 84% of women in prison are mothers. When a woman receives a sentence, so do the children who depend on her and who are \u201cthe invisible victims\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe majority of women who come into custody are mothers who have sole responsibility for the care of children. Educational outcomes are poorer, they are most likely to be living in poverty,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThere are 45,000 kids in our country right now with a parent in prison and an estimated 75,000 who have experienced parental incarceration during their childhood. It is exactly the same trauma and loss as a parent passing away with the added stigma and shame.

      "bodyText": "When she was a child Tricia Walsh used to hide under her bed. She knew she wasn\u2019t safe from anyone who came into the house. She was sexually abused by her father from an early age. Her mother was a violent alcoholic. \u201cShe was so drunk she didn\u2019t know who was coming in and out of my bedroom.\u201d By the age of 12 she had been sexually abused multiple times by relatives and the people who came to her parents\u2019 party house. \u201cI learned that I deserved having my head smashed into the floor, that I must have deserved to have my leg pulled from under my bed. To me it was normal. But they all took something from me that couldn\u2019t be put back together again.\u201d At 12 she attempted to take her own life, at 13 she dropped out of school and fled \u201cinto the arms\u201d of a notorious bikie gang. To numb the pain she started taking drugs. \u201cI became addicted to everything that was out there.\u201d She had her first child at 15 and three more by the time she was 19. When her first child was six months old, Walsh began her prison journey. There would be six more prison sentences over the next 20 years. Her youngest daughter was only 13 when she started her last long stretch, a nine-year sentence for selling drugs, \u201cwhen she most needed her mum. I didn\u2019t know what was happening to her, who was looking after her.\u201d In her grief for her children, in prison \u201cyou count every second of every minute of every hour of every day\u201d. Walsh was 44 by the time she started putting herself back together, and graduated valedictorian for a social work degree at university. All those wasted years. As confronting as it is, Walsh\u2019s story is not an unusual account of a woman\u2019s trajectory into the prison system. It is not even the worst story, but it is a common story. According to research by Sisters Inside, an advocacy group for women in prison, up to 90% of women in prison have been sexually abused and 98% have experienced violence. Emeritus professor Judy Atkinson, a Jiman/Bundjalung woman who has researched women in prisons for decades, says she has never encountered anyone in prison who has not had a violent childhood. She believes 100% of prisoners have a \u201cclear diagnosis of complex trauma\u201d. At a time when the crime rate in many Australian states has dropped, we have the highest rate of incarceration, with an overrepresentation of women, 34% of whom are Indigenous. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the general rate for women going into the prison system rose by 10% in the year to September 2018. These women are often predestined for prison from an early age, they have been treated as worthless, they had no chance. At the Sisters Inside conference in Brisbane last November, the stories told by former prisoners all spoke of brutality that started in early childhood, drugs and alcohol as teenagers, institutionalisation, juvenile detention; historical violence that has snowballed down the generations all the way from colonisation. According to the Sisters Inside founder, Debbie Kilroy, prison has become a place for warehousing people with mental illness, disability and substance abuse. \u201cWe know,\u201d says Kilroy, \u201cthat the issues that present for women in prison are about poverty and homelessness. Prison is the default response for poverty, homelessness, mental health, drug addiction, abused women. \u201cWe know that many women in prison can\u2019t even read or write. The incarceration of Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal women has increased 640% in the last 20 years and they are the ones who are the most brutalised.\u201d According to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner, June Oscar, it is a system which \u201cpunishes people for poverty\u201d. April Long, the national program manager of Shine for Kids, which works with the children of prisoners, says: \u201cThe criminal justice system is full of the women and men who need the most healing and support.\u201d These are women, she says, for whom the world has never been a safe place. Women who are punished over and over again. \u201cWhat we do when multiple systems have failed them,\u201d says Long, \u201cincluding education and health, is that we end up incarcerating them and victimise them even more.\u201d Kymberley Ranganui, now 36, was only 15 when she first went to prison. After suffering childhood abuse she would be in and out for the next 20 years on drug offences. \u201cTime stops when you go through those prison gates,\u201d she says. \u201cYou are taught nothing, you go brain dead. \u201cYou become so institutionalised that you start believing that system is the only place you exist, the only place you matter, you believe these women are your sisters, you can\u2019t adapt to society, you are a product of your own environment.\u201d She says the recidivism rate is high because women come out and are given no support, \u201cnot even a voucher\u201d, and \u201cgo back to their old ways\u201d because they \u201ccan\u2019t cope and don\u2019t know how to do it. They go fuck it, and sometimes go back purposefully.\u201d Ranganui\u2019s son Jakob was only a month old when she was given a two-year sentence at the age of 25. \u201cThey didn\u2019t take anything into consideration, my past history or my pregnancy. I had reports, psychologists coming in with me,\u201d she says. With leaking breasts, on \u201can emotional rollercoaster, I was breaking down, my hormones were everywhere, it is not good physically, mentally, emotionally, having to do a sentence, having to worry about my baby\u201d while she fought both her sentence and to have her son in prison with her. It took six months of anguish to get her child. \u201cIt is in a child\u2019s best interests to be with their mother. Can\u2019t we figure out another way? Why not do a sentence out in the community?\u201d When Ranganui came out of prison with an 18-month-old son, \u201cI was on my own, I didn\u2019t even have food for him or any parenting programs.\u201d Domestic violence a major cause of women\u2019s incarceration While no one disputes that violent offenders should be in prison, most women are in prison for relatively minor crimes that come from substance abuse, poverty and desperation. Kilroy points to tough new bail laws women who are on remand, due to the tough new bail laws, because they have been involved in domestic violence but who will not get a custodial sentence. \u201cTwenty per cent of the women on remand are in prison for that. Some of them don\u2019t even have a criminal history or they have a very minor criminal history, but they are languishing in prison on remand for months. By then she has lost the house, the kids, a job, property. You never get any of that back.\u201d Domestic violence directly or indirectly is a major cause of women being incarcerated. Directly when she finally retaliates or indirectly when there is, say, financial abuse. \u201cThen you might offend so you can feed your children or pay for their school uniforms. A woman traumatised by constant violence can starting drinking or using drugs to self-medicate,\u201d says Dr Samantha Jeffries from the School of Criminal Justice at Griffith University. When the police turn up to an incident they can put an order on both people without differentiating who the perpetrator is, or can mistake the victim for the aggressor. \u201cHe is calm,\u201d says Kilroy, \u201cit is \u2018good mate, how are you, mate\u2019, he is a good bloke, you know. She is crying and hysterical and can\u2019t keep it together.\u201d Or she may have breached bail conditions because she changed address in running from a violent situation or be homeless because of it and is not aware of a court date. When a lawyer seeking mitigation for sentencing asks if they have experienced domestic violence, a woman will often say no. Says associate professor Katherine McFarlane of Charles Sturt University: \u201cIf all you have ever known is exploitation and abuse it is not seen as domestic violence. It is normalised.\u201d They can also be protecting the kids who may be with the perpetrator. According to Long, up to 84% of women in prison are mothers. When a woman receives a sentence, so do the children who depend on her and who are \u201cthe invisible victims\u201d. \u201cThe majority of women who come into custody are mothers who have sole responsibility for the care of children. Educational outcomes are poorer, they are most likely to be living in poverty,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are 45,000 kids in our country right now with a parent in prison and an estimated 75,000 who have experienced parental incarceration during their childhood. It is exactly the same trauma and loss as a parent passing away with the added stigma and shame. These are the most disadvantaged and vulnerable people in our community.\u201d Children can end up in out of home care, which causes the mother huge anxiety as she has often come through the foster care system herself and knows about the abuse that was the start of her own journey into the justice system, she said. When she came out of prison Tricia Walsh found that \u201cmy two girls were in extremely violent relationships, being stabbed, being beaten. That was my role modelling. My boy ran away to Sydney because he didn\u2019t want to be known as my son. But now I want to live my life creating a space where my grandchildren can be safe. All I want is their safety.\u201d Now an activist, Vickie Roach came into the foster care system when she was two-and-a-half years old and removed from her mother who was in hospital having a baby and who had been stolen herself. \u201cAs teenagers we were treated as absolute peak offenders because of that initial criminal charge.\u201d Roach would be in and out of prison for three decades before she turned her life around and got a masters degree in writing from Swinburne University. \u201cNowadays,\u201d she says, \u201c50% of the children we have locked up in this country have been in out of home care. Research suggests that the links between the child protection system, juvenile justice system and adult incarceration are so strong that they could be considered as key drivers to adult incarceration. The risk increases if you are Aboriginal. Aboriginal children represent 90% of all kids on care and protection orders and placed into care. It is one of the most pressing human rights challenges facing Australia today.\u201d \u201cThat is a big concern,\u201d says Long, \u201cchildren of prisoners are six times more likely to end up in prison. Children should not be punished for the actions of their parents, they are innocent, they haven\u2019t committed a crime. \u201cBut they suffer family fragmentation, identity issues, financial distress, lack of money coming into the house, isolation. We see a lot of intergenerational offending and that is a cycle we want to break, we don\u2019t want jail to become normalised for these kids.\u201d These are kids, says Long, who might be stealing simply to feed themselves. Australia is a signatory to the United Nations rules for the treatment of women prisoners and non-custodial measures for women offenders, known as the Bangkok rules. But those who work with the judicial system say the rules where detention is a last resort are rarely implemented in Australia. At the intersection between the criminal justice system and welfare, the criminal justice system always triumphs.

The report cited an unnamed official as the source of the information. Given coal is Australia\u2019s biggest export earner, the news from Reuters sent the Australian dollar tumbling, and senior government figures in Canberra scrambling to ascertain the truth of the report. Late on Friday a spokesman from the ministry of foreign affairs in China said the Reuters report was untrue.

The foreign ministry spokesman said the purpose of the testing was \u201cto better protect the legitimate interests and rights of Chinese importers and the environmental safety\u201d. Birmingham said on Sunday the Australia/China relationship was on a constructive footing, and he said he had conveyed to Chinese officials the importance of keeping coal moving through the ports. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just important for Australian businesses, it\u2019s important for the Chinese businesses which rely on this product,\u201d the trade minister said.

But the shadow environment minister argues that he can\u2019t telegraph a firm disposition about what he might do about the approvals in the future without making a prejudgment that could render any subsequent decision unlawful. Adani has flared again as a political problem for Labor federally because key unions have made public interventions over the past week arguing that the project should be supported by the Queensland Labor government \u2013 interventions that have been leapt on by Coalition frontbenchers who see opportunity to bolster the Morrison government\u2019s political position in central Queensland in the coming election. While the government is blasting Labor from a pro-coal, pro-jobs position, Labor is also under sustained pressure from the environment movement, the Greens and progressive activist groups to toughen its stance against a project which has become a proxy for action on climate change in the national political debate. Burke told the ABC on Sunday morning there were \u201cdeep problems with the way the Liberal government has handled the environmental approvals\u201d. \u201cFrom the environmental end, I have always been sceptical of the project,\u201d Burke said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about from what\u2019s been reported the government doesn\u2019t appear to have followed the law with respect to the use of the water trigger.\u201d The shadow minister referenced the sustained pressure from the Greens and environmentalists for Labor to adopt a more definitive position on the project, but Burke said he was not, because of his portfolio responsibilities, in a position to be definitive. \u201cIt is unlawful for it to be prejudged.\u201d In explaining his stance, Burke referenced a long-running saga in the 2000s in which a Liberal environment minister had to overturn his own decision to block a $220m windfarm project to save orange-bellied parrots after a federal court appeal. Burke has been telegraphing problems with the environmental approvals since taking the portfolio. Last year he called for a federal investigation after sensitive wetlands were contaminated near the Great Barrier Reef after Cyclone Debbie, pointing out that environmental approvals for Adani\u2019s Abbot Point terminal placed conditions on the project, including the downstream impacts on the Caley Valley wetlands. Bill Shorten signalled publicly, and privately to environmental activists at the start of 2018, that federal Labor was looking to toughen its position against the controversial project. During that period, which coincided with the Batman byelection in Victoria, the Australian Conservation Foundation gave Shorten legal advice arguing that the commonwealth environment minister has discretion to revoke the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act approval for Adani \u201con at least two grounds\u201d. The first ground would be \u201cnew information of the consecutive bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, indicating increased sensitivity to greenhouse gas emissions\u201d and the second would be \u201cnew information of the insufficiency of offsets for the endangered black-throated finch, indicating a threat to the continued survival of the species from the Carmichael project\u201d. Shorten pulled back from those public signals of equivocation after encountering internal opposition to toughening up the position on Adani, with some colleagues concerned about the implications for sovereign risk, and also the electoral fallout in central Queensland. Labor\u2019s position on the project has been the mine should not go ahead if it doesn\u2019t stack up environmentally or commercially, and taxpayers should not provide support.

I dominated pretty much every single every round. I believe I proved the doubters wrong tonight. They said I was going to get my head jabbed off. It was the most important fight of my career.

Eubank\u2019s energy levels rose at the halfway point and he rocked DeGale in centre ring to edge the sixth. Just as he appeared to be falling behind, DeGale came to life in the seventh, only to lose concentration again.</p> <p>The younger man now looked dominant for longer stretches and the normally elusive Degale was stopping more than his share of punches, although stop-start nature of the contest did not make for a great spectacle.</p> <p>DeGale poked out his tongue at the end of each round but did not often enough follow the gesture with anything substantial, his contributions speculative single-shot assaults. </p> <p>By most estimates, DeGale entered the championship rounds in deficit \u2013 and the spark remained missing, with his right eye leaking blood again.

A polite athlete who might more appropriately be called Gentleman Joe, Joyce was merciless as he doused the ambitions of the 40-year-old Stiverne, who lasted less than a minute in his previous outing, two Novembers ago against Deontay Wilder.

Since 2010 no player has won more times on the PGA Tour from a trailingposition before a Sunday ball was struck. McIlroy is aiming for win number eight in that category. Johnson won this WGC in 2017; McIlroy is chasing a first success since prevailing in emphatic style at Bay Hill last March.</p> <p>McIlroy\u2019s problem on Saturday was that every time he seemed to make headway Johnson summoned a fresh spirit. A Johnson wobble at the 10th, where he took a double-bogey six, as McIlroy produced a birdie cut a five-shot lead to two. Johnson\u2019s response was forceful; he picked up shots on his next two holes.</p> <p>The Northern Irishman produced one of the shots of the tournament from under a tree and 275 yards out at the par-five 15th. Johnson, meanwhile, had pulled his approach left. Johnson\u2019s short-game magic followed, with his glorious chip assisted by green contours finishing within tap-in range. While McIlroy missed his eagle putt, the trading of birdie fours actually felt like a win for Johnson. The American inflicted another blow on McIlroy one hole from home, courtesy of a birdie two.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s 66 was two shots better than McIlroy\u2019s third-day display. Sixteen under par plays 12 under par. From such a position Johnson will naturally be the favourite \u2013 but he has displayed a historic tendency to wobble if engaged in the kind of scrap McIlroy will relish.</p> <p>Patrick Reed, the Masters champion, blasted himself into contention thanks to a 64. \u201cI\u2019m naturally an aggressive player as it is and I feel like I played pretty aggressively so far on this golf course,\u201d Reed said. Somewhat surprisingly, he has not won since donning the Green Jacket last April. Reed is now nine under par and therefore part of the group, which also includes Cameron Smith, Sergio Garc\u00eda and Patrick Cantlay, closest to the pair at the leaderboard\u2019s summit. Ian Poulter\u2019s 69 ensured he joined Kiradech Aphibarnrat at eight under.</p> <p>Tiger Woods had aspirations of a final Sunday grouping when holding just a five-iron for his approach to the 15th. The 14-times major winner was eight under at that juncture. The stuff of golfing nightmares followed. Woods found a greenside bunker and was to four-putt. Three of those arrived from 4ft. The eventual double-bogey, which was followed by another dropped shot, did not end Woods\u2019s hopes of a 19th WGC crown but he requires Sunday snookers from a position of minus six. Unusually for Woods but in what was undoubtedly an indication of his state of mind, he skipped post-round media duties.</p> <p>Lee Westwood\u2019s bid to make what would be a 19th Masters appearance received a boost courtesy of a third-round 65. Westwood started this event as the 60th ranked player in the world; the top 50 at the end of March earn an invite from Augusta National.</p> <p>Jordan Spieth\u2019s struggles, though, continue. The Texan posted a second 75 in three rounds to move to plus six for the tournament. With the Masters, previously a Spieth specialism, moving into view the scenario is ominous; his best result in this 2018-19 season is a share of 35th.</p>",
