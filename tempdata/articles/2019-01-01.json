Women hold 20 of the Liberal party\u2019s 68 seats across both houses of parliament, a number which could drop to six at the next election, given how many of those seats in the lower house are marginal. The Liberal party and its Coalition partner, the Nationals, which counts just two women MPs in its ranks, have struggled in recent months to deal with what MPs have termed \u201cthe women problem\u201d, following a series of sex scandals, allegations of harassment and women losing preselection to men. But Sarah Henderson, backed by Linda Reynolds in an editorial, have both told the Australian the Liberal party can be proud of its record on women, claiming it has done more than the Labor party to advance gender parity. That claim was ridiculed by Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, who pointed out Labor had twice as many women in parliament as the Liberals. Henderson, a Victorian MP who holds the Coalition\u2019s most marginal seat, Corangamite, by just 0.03%, said she did not experience any bullying or intimidation during the August leadership spill, despite several of her colleagues having reported harassment, and the party establishing an independent complaints process in the wake of the reports. \u201cIn my view, being lobbied for votes does not constitute bullying,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cI can\u2019t walk in anyone else\u2019s shoes, I can only speak about my experience. But I can certainly say that being lobbied for votes is an integral part of a political process and it does not constitute bullying.\u201d Henderson\u2019s comments came just days after her former Liberal colleague Julia Banks gave an interview to the Australian Women\u2019s Weekly, where she once again spoke of the bullying and intimidation she said MPs were subjected to during the leadership spill. In her editorial, Reynolds repeated the argument she made several times last year; that a quota system, like the one Labor instigated, which has led to almost 50% women representation, did not help create cultural change. Reynolds said without the quota, she believed the number of women in Labor ranks would revert to what they once were, as nothing had been done to encourage a natural cultural shift within the party\u2019s core. \u201cQuotas in and of themselves are a quick fix, but they do not change the structural and cultural barriers in an organisation. In the absence of other organisational transformations, when quotas are removed the changes do not stick,\u201d she wrote. Plibersek said those justifications were laughable. \u201cLabor has more than double the number of women the Liberals have in the parliament and about the twice the number of women on our front bench,\u201d she said. \u201cThat speaks for itself. \u201cOver the last five years, all Scott Morrison and the Liberals have done is deliver policies that disadvantage women. The Liberals tried five times to slash paid parental leave, and called working mums \u2018rorters\u2019 and \u2018double dippers\u2019. \u201cThe Liberals argued against increases to the minimum wage that substantially benefit women \u2026 and they also tried to cut around $35m from Community Legal Centres that provide crucial legal services to family violence victims.\u201d In September, several Liberal women MPs wore red on the same day, in a sartorial protest against the treatment of women, inspired by the red shoes Julie Bishop wore as she announced her resignation from the front bench, following Scott Morrison\u2019s ascent to the prime minister\u2019s suite. Henderson pointed to the women\u2019s economic statement, reinstated as part of the budget by Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, who, in a meeting with Morrison and Victorian MPs following the November state election, reportedly said the Liberal party was viewed as \u201chomophobic, anti-women, climate change deniers\u201d. O\u2019Dwyer has not disputed the reports, but, pressed in question time that same month, said she believed the Coalition to be \u201cthe natural government for Australian women\u201d. Privately, O\u2019Dwyer had lobbied for an independent complaints review process to be established within the Liberal party\u2019s federal and state executives to deal with the issue, which Morrison, attempting to stem the damaging ongoing flow of allegations, agreed to in September, the same day as the red sartorial protest.",

Happy New Year everyone and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s leg-by-leg coverage of this year\u2019s PDC World Championship final, a decider that will be contested by Michael van Gerwen and Michael Smith.</p> <p>Ranked No1, Van Gerwen is hoping to win his third world title, having previously triumphed in 2014 and 2017. The Dutchman is the red-hot favourite to prevail over Smith, from St Helens and ranked nine places below. Before this year, Smith had never advanced further than the quarter-final he lost against Raymond van Barneveld in 2016. Tonight\u2019s match begins around 8.20pm (GMT) and it\u2019s the best of 13 sets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e9982a8a2cc2b0999fe87d993e31ed3de7fbaec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e9982a8a2cc2b0999fe87d993e31ed3de7fbaec/0_0_2700_1417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandra Palace\" width=\"1000\" height=\"525\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ally Pally \u2013 the calm before the beer-swamped fancy dress storm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Duncan/ProSports/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-01T18:32:55.705Z\">at 6.32pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

Michael van Gerwen speaks: \u201cThis is the best feeling you can have,\u201d he says on Sky. \u201cI have worked for this so long and everyone knows I\u2019ve had a difficult year. I\u2019ve played good but I haven\u2019t performed as well as I could have done so to win this trophy it\u2019s phenomenal. This means a lot to me.\u201d It was far from a classic final: Both players seemed extremely nervous and neither gave a decent account of themselves. While there\u2019s no shame in losing to Van Gerwen, Michael Smith will be extremely disappointed that he didn\u2019t play anywhere near as well as he could have this evening. He had chances at doubles to win more sets, but he just couldn\u2019t hit them. They\u2019re not hanging about: Barry Hearn comes on and presents Michael Smith with his runner-up cheque for \u00a3200,000. He\u2019s applauded by the crowd. Moments later, Michael van Gerwen receives the trophy for the third time and holds it aloft under an explosion of ticker-tape. Michael Van Gerwen 7-3 Michael Smith Michael van Gerwen leaves himself double 16 and nails it on his second \u2013 or was it third \u2013 attempt to take the title!!! Sets: Van Gerwen 6-3 Smith. Legs: 2-1* Van Gerwen misses a match dart on double 16 and Smith keeps himself in the contest with an arrow into tops. Sets: Van Gerwen 6-3 Smith. Legs: *2-0 A 180 from Smith leaves him on 49 for the leg, but he misses his 26th, 27th and 28th darts at doubles. Van Gerwen punishes him accordingly to leave himself one leg from victory. Sets: Van Gerwen 6-3 Smith. Legs: 1-0* Van Gerwen wins the opening leg of the 10th set against the throw to put himself in the box-seat. Sets: Van Gerwen 6-3 Smith. Legs: *2-3 Smith takes the set!!! He had missed double seven and that looked the end. But unable to find the treble he needs, Michael van Gerwen is unable to put himself on a double and Smith takes advantage at the second time of asking. He\u2019s still swinging. Sets: Van Gerwen 6-2 Smith. Legs: 2-2* Smith hangs in there with a magnificent 72 checkout just after his 11th 180. Brave darts, but perhaps too little too late. Sets: Van Gerwen 6-2 Smith. Legs: 2-1* Crikey! Van Gerwen wins the leg before I\u2019ve finished typing up the last one. It was a massacre and he nails double 12 at the first time of asking. Sets: Van Gerwen 6-2 Smith. Legs: 1-1* Michael Smith takes this one with an accidental double 20 followed by double 10. Even he doesn\u2019t look too interested any more. All he can do is keep trying to win one log after another. \u201cIf he thinks he has to win the next five sets he\u2019ll just drive himself crazy,\u201d says Wayne Mardle. Sets: Van Gerwen 6-2 Smith. Legs: *1-0 Van Gerwen has the throw in what could be the final set of the match. He wins the opening leg at his leisure. There\u2019s barely a murmur from the crowd, who seem to have lost all interest. Sets: Van Gerwen 6-2 Smith. Legs: 3-2* Having been let in when Van Gerwen missed a double to take the set, Smith fails to spear the bull, double 10 and double 5 to nick it!!! AAAAGGHHHH!!! HOW MANY CHANCES DO YOU NEED?!?!?!?!? Michael van Gerwen eventually puts him out of his misery and finds himself one set away from winning his third world title. Sets: Van Gerwen 5-2 Smith. Legs: *2-2 Van Gerwen wins with a minimum of fuss, but Smith now has the throw in the final leg of the set. Sets: Van Gerwen 5-2 Smith. Legs: 1-2* A 93-out gives Smith the leg, but on Sky Sports, Wayne Mardle is criticising him for his poor choice of trebles. \u201cYou can\u2019t go for the wrong treble and hope you get two of them,\u201d he says. \u201cSet up play is as important as any other play.\u201d Sets: Van Gerwen 5-2 Smith. Legs: *1-1 Van Gerwen misses four at double 10 before winning the leg at his fifth attempt. Sets: Van Gerwen 5-2 Smith. Legs: 0-1* With both players performing well below their best, Van Gerwen finds himself just two sets from victory. Having taken a flurry of punches, he played his best darts of the match for that seventh set and quietened a crowd that had been briefly awoken from its slumber. Smith misses a double nine to take the opening leg, but Van Gerwen doesn\u2019t punish him. Smith nails his third attempt at double 18 to take the leg. Sets: Van Gerwen 5-2 Smith. Legs: 3-1* A mightily relieved looking Michael Van Gerwen takes the seventh set to leave himself two away from victory. Smith had him under the cosh, briefly, but was unable to capitalise on his run of four massive legs. He\u2019ll need to dig extremely deep to mount another comeback. Sets: Van Gerwen 4-2 Smith. Legs: *2-1 Van Gerwen continues to weather the storm, albeit unimpressively. He misses two doubles before taking double eight to go ahead in the set. Sets: Van Gerwen 4-2 Smith. Legs: 1-1* Apologies - I was a leg ahead of myself there. Smith wins leg two of set No7 with a 66 checkout on double top. Sets: Van Gerwen 4-2 Smith. Legs: *1-0 Smith misses a double 13 to take five legs on the spin and Van Gerwen stops the tide for now. Sets: Van Gerwen 4-2 Smith. Legs: 0-3* Averaging 110 in the set, Smith wins No6 with double top. The fightback is on and he looks a player transformed!!! Sets: Van Gerwen 4-1 Smith. Legs: *0-2 Interesting! Very interesting! Back to back three-figure out-shots and bullseye finishes from Smith leave Van Gerwen visibly rattled and get the crowd on their feet. This time he checks out on 124. Sets: Van Gerwen 4-1 Smith. Legs: 0-1* Having clawed back one set, Smith has the throw as he tries to win a second. Michael van Gerwen is not - repeat, not - playing well tonight and is under huge pressure to win this final. If Smith wins another set, his opponent will be sweating. Smith takes out 127 , finishing on the bull to take first blood in this set. Van Gerwen 4-1 Smith. Legs: *2-3 Hallelujah! Smith gives himself a chance, however slim, by taking the fifth set with an excellent checkout of 124. Each of his final three darts were roared home by the crowd and he turns to milk their applause accordingly. They\u2019ve woken up and finally he has too - can he mount some sort of comeback? We\u2019ll find out soon enough. Sets: Van Gerwen 4-0 Smith. Legs: 2-2* Van Gerwen comes up short on an 170 outshot, hitting 25 when in need of the bull after consecutive treble 20s. Smith keeps himself in the set. Sets: Van Gerwen 4-0 Smith. Legs: *2-1 Van Gerwen takes the leg at his first attempt, spearing double 16. He has now won two-thirds of the 21 legs that have been played in this very dreary, flat final. Sets: Van Gerwen 4-0 Smith. Legs: 1-1* When your luck\u2019s out, your luck\u2019s out. Smith knocks one of his own darts out of the T20 bed with another and both hit the floor. He gets away with it and takes the leg. Neither player is anywhere near their best here, but Van Gerwen is still bossing proceedings. Sets: Van Gerwen 4-0 Smith. Legs: *1-0 With more than half his night\u2019s work done, Van Gerwen is rubbing the Bully Boy\u2019s nose in the dirt. Without playing particularly well, Mighty Mike is giving him at absolute pummelling on the Alexandra Palace oche. He missed four darts at double 12 in the last leg of set No4 and needs a massive improvement. Van Gerwen wins the first leg of set No5 as the crowd threaten to fall asleep. Sets: Van Gerwen 4-0 Smith. Legs: 3-2* Van Gerwen pulls one well wide of the bull and lets in Smith. He gives himself a chance with double 12, but misses. Between them, the players miss six consecutive darts at doubles before Van Gerwen wins the leg and his fourth consecutive set. Smith is doing himself no favours whatsoever here. His nerves look shot. He\u2019s been ahead just twice in one of the four sets we\u2019ve played thus far. Sets: Van Gerwen 3-0 Smith. Legs: *2-2 Van Gerwen has missed more doubles than Smith and is chugging along with a low - by his standards - average of 102.5. Nevertheless, he\u2019s completely dominant and spears another double 20 to restore parity in this set. Sets: Van Gerwen 3-0 Smith. Legs: 1-2* Smith has a 116 outshot but pulls all three darts. Van Gerwen fails to capitalise and leaves him three shots at double 20. He sinks the second one. Sets: Van Gerwen 3-0 Smith. Legs: *1-1 The crowd amuse themselves with a sing-song as another fairly boring leg ends with Van Gerwen spiking double 20. He is in complete control of this match. Sets: Van Gerwen 3-0 Smith. Legs: 0-1* Smith holds his throw to lead in a set for the first time. It\u2019s a start ... and a long overdue one at that. Sets: Van Gerwen 3-0 Smith. Legs: 3-1* Michael van Gerwen leaves himself double top and takes it out on his second attempt after more appalling darts from Smith, who just can\u2019t find his rhythm. Sets: Van Gerwen 2-0 Smith. Legs: 2-1* Smith keeps the set going after Van Gerwen missed double 16 to take three in a row. Sets: Van Gerwen 2-0 Smith. Legs: *2-0 Smith loses another leg and continues to look nervous. He pulled three dartas in a row below the treble 20 wire in that leg. Sets: Van Gerwen 2-0 Smith. Legs: *1-0 Van Gerwen throws six poor early darts, but once again Smith fails to punish his inaccuracy. He has a 134 outshot and leaves himself tops. He gets it with his third dart. Another leg in the bank and he has the throw in this set - it\u2019s already looking ominous for Smith, who is shanking arrows all over the place. The atmosphere at Ally Pally is very flat, as the crowd were expecting more bang for their buck. Sets: Van Gerwen 2-0 Smith. Legs: 3-1* Three poor darts from Van Gerwen let Smith in but he misses with two darts at double 10. Not good enough - he has missed a shocking 10 darts at doubles in the opening two sets and they\u2019ve cost him dearly. Sets: Van Gerwen 1-0 Smith. Legs: *2-1 Van Gerwen scores his second maximum of the match, but misses the bull for the leg. Smith bangs one into double 16 at the second attempt to keep himself in the set. Sets: Van Gerwen 1-0 Smith. Legs: *2-0 This final has failed to ignite thus far, but if Smith can win an early set, the place will erupt. It\u2019s crucial he doesn\u2019t fall too far behind. Van Gerwen takes the leg with another three-figure outshot of 126, finishing on double 18. Sets: Van Gerwen 1-0 Smith. Legs: 1-0* Having left the stage for a brief interval, the players return for the second set. After throwing a few warm-up darts, Michael Smith opens with 60, but isn\u2019t punished. He misses the bull to take the leg and is left with 25 after Van Gerwen fails to take out 170. Not good enough and a double 10 for Van Gerwen is enough for the Dutchman to win the leg against the throw. Sets: Van Gerwen 1-0 Smith. Legs: 3-2* Van Gerwen takes the opening set. He missed another dart for it, this time missing double 12. Another dart sails into the 12 bed but he makes no mistake on double six and takes the set by the odd leg of the five. Sets: Van Gerwen 0-0 Smith. Legs: *2-2 Smith takes consecutive legs, nailing double three after Van Gerwen had missed his second shot for the set in the opening set. Sets: Van Gerwen 0-0 Smith. Legs: 2-1* Van Gerwen misses double four, letting in Smith to hit bullseye and take his first leg of the match with a 90 outshot. The pair had exchanged 180s earlier in the leg. Sets: Van Gerwen 0-0 Smith. Legs: *2-0 Smith throws the first maximum of the match but loses the leg. Van Gerwen gets two shots at a double and after missing 16s, hits 8s after Smith had missed a 70 checkout. Sets: Van Gerwen 0-0 Smith. Legs: 1-0* A great start by Van Gerwen, who finishes on a bull to take out a 129 checkout and take the first leg. Game on! Michael van Gerwen has the throw in the first leg and throws 174 with his second three darts. \u201cStand up if you love the darts!\u201d roars the crowd, rising to their feet. Mighty Michael van Gerwen joins him: The Dutchman walks on to a chorus of Seven Nation Army from the White Stripes and boos from a boozed up crowd who have obviously decided who they want to win. Everyone loves an underdog and Michael Smith is undoubtedly in that role tonight. Van Gerwen looks a little bit nervous, Smith to the manor born. Michael \u201cThe Bullyboy\u201d Smith makes his entrance: He makes his way to the stage and blows kisses to the crowd as the stage dancers do their thing to the accompaniment of a pyrotechnic show. Not long now: Master of Ceremonies John McDonald, who I\u2019m obliged to say once saw me throw 100 and said \u201cgood darts, mate\u201d when I pulled them out of the board, is introducing the players ... Gary Anderson speaks: Having admitted he \u201cgot an awful whupping\u201d from MVG in the semi-final, the Flying Scotsman, two-times world champion and massively good egg says he\u2019s confident his friend Michael Smith can beat the Dutchman tonight. \u201cTonight is the night the boy becomes a man,\u201d he tells Sky\u2019s Laura Woods. \u201cThis is the night he\u2019s been waiting for for 10 years.\u201d The players are at the Palace: Michael Smith turned up dressed casually, looking relaxed with a rucksack slung over one shoulder and a young mini-me who I\u2019m guessing is his son by his side. Father and son were sporting identical fin haircuts and looking like they meant business. On Sky Sports, the pundits reckon he has every chance of beating tonight\u2019s favourite. \u201cHe has to stay with Van Gerwen in the first two sets,\u201d says Rod Harrington.

Or at the very least, let\u2019s watch darts! Or read about somebody else watching darts! Happy New Year everyone and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s leg-by-leg coverage of this year\u2019s PDC World Championship final, a decider that will be contested by Michael van Gerwen and Michael Smith. Ranked No1, Van Gerwen is hoping to win his third world title, having previously triumphed in 2014 and 2017. The Dutchman is the red-hot favourite to prevail over Smith, from St Helens and ranked nine places below. Before this year, Smith had never advanced further than the quarter-final he lost against Raymond van Barneveld in 2016. Tonight\u2019s match begins around 8.20pm (GMT) and it\u2019s the best of 13 sets.",

Unfortunately, Dr Icy Lake has seen what is expected of psychiatrists in police procedurals and remains unmoved. \u201cThis is a tawdry form of manipulation,\u201d she says frostily. \u201cI expected better.\u201d Fortunately, it\u2019s all a front and they are able to tap her phone as she arranges to meet James in the woods and usher him to safety and follow her there. Unfortunately, It all goes wrong and they lose their man. Fortunately for the viewer, there are two tremendous twists thereafter that promise to power us comfortably through the next three episodes and into the new year. Luther too, maybe, if he buys a bigger coat in the sales.",

      "body": "<h2>\u2018I learned to think like a Dalek a long time ago\u2019</h2> \n<p>Happy Who Year! I had mixed feelings about the festive special moving to the new year \u2013 not least because I worried it would ruin Christmas. But after 13 years, the yuletide themes were getting increasingly random, veering from romcom to superhero caper. Perhaps last year\u2019s Twice Upon a Time, with its depiction of the first world war Christmas armistice, was the right way to end that tradition?</p> \n<p>I\u2019m happy to report that was probably the case. Resolution is, by light years, the best episode of this new era. Speculation has been burning that the reported title was a fake out this episode would actually be called Resolution of the Daleks. After everything from Evil of the Daleks to Asylum of the Daleks, it wasn\u2019t a bad guess \u2013 especially as the return of the Pepperpots was out of the bag, to those who were looking. Chris Chibnall stopped short of doing that, but still, what an absolute delight. The whole business in the ninth century and the archaeologists was a convoluted way to avoid any mention of the big reveal ahead of time. But I didn\u2019t really care, because it worked.</p> \n<p>It was a noble intention of Chibnall to launch his tenure as a jumping-in point for new fans, dispensing with old monsters and continuity. But the powering force of Nu-Who since 2005 has been its ability to power forward while immersing itself in the world\u2019s rich history. More than that, the Daleks\u2019 return afforded Jodie\u2019s Thirteen a gravitas she has often been missing, taking the character back to the deep, visceral fear of these creatures that 55 years of story has sustained.<strong> </strong>Too often, she has been left to goof around, namedropping Pythagoras and discussing her love of custard creams. To paraphrase another great Doctor: you can always judge a woman by the quality of her enemies.</p> \n<p>I was reminded of the 2005 highlight Dalek from writer Robert Shearman. The way that episode hammered home the danger and menace and unadulterated hatred within a single Dalek <em>made</em> Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor, just as this did for Jodie Whittaker. And that menace has not always been true of the Daleks (more below). Now, and it has taken a while, the Doctor is truly back in business.</p> \n<h2><strong>\u2018Family isn\u2019t just about DNA. It\u2019s about what you do. And you haven\u2019t done enough\u2019</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c1b63b55ccf2bd0f774841e98d691fada2348a1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c1b63b55ccf2bd0f774841e98d691fada2348a1/0_287_4300_2580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The longest scene ever shown in Doctor Who \u2026 Ryan in the cafe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The longest scene ever shown in Doctor Who? \u2026 Ryan in the cafe.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Pardon/BBC</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I don\u2019t view TV with a stopwatch, but I\u2019m pretty sure that two-hander between Ryan and his dad in the cafe was one of the longest scenes ever shown in Doctor Who. More extraordinary because it wasn\u2019t a set piece, but an eviscerating attempt at mending broken father-son bonds. Chibnall tends to ramp up the emotion as a writer, but the Ryan and Graham story has sometimes felt laboured. Here, we got the resolution of the title, as Aaron reveals himself, somewhat surprisingly, as a good egg (though it is lost on me how he finished off the Dalek with a microwave). One thing though: even after a marathon 19 consecutive New Year\u2019s days, it was still out of character for Ryan to be calling Graham \u201cGramps\u201d after choking on the word \u201cGrandad\u201d just weeks ago. </p> \n<h2><strong>Life aboard the Tardis</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49560bd79540f081c3f3ead48465862e542a7956\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49560bd79540f081c3f3ead48465862e542a7956/0_326_4300_2579/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Is Yaz the most underused companion in Doctor Who history? \u2026 The Doctor with the Yaz, Mitch, Ryan and Graham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Is Yaz the most underused companion in Doctor Who history? \u2026 the Doctor with Yaz, Mitch, Ryan and Graham.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophie Mutevelian/BBC</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>All this Resolution leaves is Yaz, the most underused companion in Doctor Who history. It\u2019s a shame, because Mandip Gill is a talented actor overshadowed by the Graham-Ryan-Grace arc of this series, and the Yaz-centric Demons of the Punjab is widely regarded as the highlight episode. Now, at least, she appears to have something to do \u2013 namely be the Doctor\u2019s PA. It strikes me that their she-mance is the main relationship between the Doctor and her friends; we don\u2019t see much at all between her and the boys. Let\u2019s just hope Yaz gets more to do next series. </p> \n<h2><strong>Fear factor</strong></h2> \n<p>In what will probably be the most controversial element of this episode, history has been rewritten in the shape of a steampunk recon Dalek. The plunger on its right arm has been replaced with a far more menacing claw. It was historically a triumph of writing that a saltshaker armed with a plunger and a whisk could pass for the most dangerous creature in the universe. And Russell T Davies did come up with some imaginatively murderous functions for that plunger. But this reinvention of the Daleks has truly reinstated their menace. </p> \n<h2><strong>Mysteries, questions and continuity</strong></h2> \n<p>There was a lovely throwback to The Day of the Doctor when UNIT\u2019s Black Archive was plundered. But no sooner than that, we discovered that the Unified Intelligence Taskforce had been disbanded. But with UNIT disbanded and Torchwood an awkward distant memory, it is now down to Team Tardis alone to defend the Earth. I hope Kate Stewart and Petronella Osgood got decent military payouts.</p> \n<h2><strong>Deeper into the vortex</strong></h2> \n<p>\u2022 Who said we weren\u2019t getting a Christmas special this year? If you haven\u2019t caught it yet, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06vy9sj\">check out this lovely Santa-themed animation</a>. The last time the Doctor knowingly met Santa was in the 2014 special Last Christmas, with Saint Nick portrayed by Nick Frost.</p> \n<p>\u2022 I got a Killing Eve frisson from the giant CAPSLOCK location bumpers in the opening sequence, which made me happy.<br><br>\u2022 By quite some margin, this was Chibnall\u2019s biggest body count of the series. I expect he enjoyed it.</p> \n<h2><strong>Next time</strong></h2> \n<p>That\u2019s all the Doctor Who we\u2019re getting in 2019. We\u2019re promised a new series \u201cearly in 2020\u201d, so at least it\u2019s not the full two-year gap we\u2019ve had in the past. What we do know is that all of Team Tardis will be returning for series 38/12. And since they\u2019re getting into their stride, that\u2019s something to look forward to.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom

      "bodyText": "\u2018I learned to think like a Dalek a long time ago\u2019 Happy Who Year! I had mixed feelings about the festive special moving to the new year \u2013 not least because I worried it would ruin Christmas. But after 13 years, the yuletide themes were getting increasingly random, veering from romcom to superhero caper. Perhaps last year\u2019s Twice Upon a Time, with its depiction of the first world war Christmas armistice, was the right way to end that tradition? I\u2019m happy to report that was probably the case. Resolution is, by light years, the best episode of this new era. Speculation has been burning that the reported title was a fake out this episode would actually be called Resolution of the Daleks. After everything from Evil of the Daleks to Asylum of the Daleks, it wasn\u2019t a bad guess \u2013 especially as the return of the Pepperpots was out of the bag, to those who were looking. Chris Chibnall stopped short of doing that, but still, what an absolute delight. The whole business in the ninth century and the archaeologists was a convoluted way to avoid any mention of the big reveal ahead of time. But I didn\u2019t really care, because it worked. It was a noble intention of Chibnall to launch his tenure as a jumping-in point for new fans, dispensing with old monsters and continuity. But the powering force of Nu-Who since 2005 has been its ability to power forward while immersing itself in the world\u2019s rich history. More than that, the Daleks\u2019 return afforded Jodie\u2019s Thirteen a gravitas she has often been missing, taking the character back to the deep, visceral fear of these creatures that 55 years of story has sustained. Too often, she has been left to goof around, namedropping Pythagoras and discussing her love of custard creams. To paraphrase another great Doctor: you can always judge a woman by the quality of her enemies. I was reminded of the 2005 highlight Dalek from writer Robert Shearman. The way that episode hammered home the danger and menace and unadulterated hatred within a single Dalek made Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor, just as this did for Jodie Whittaker. And that menace has not always been true of the Daleks (more below). Now, and it has taken a while, the Doctor is truly back in business. \u2018Family isn\u2019t just about DNA. It\u2019s about what you do. And you haven\u2019t done enough\u2019 I don\u2019t view TV with a stopwatch, but I\u2019m pretty sure that two-hander between Ryan and his dad in the cafe was one of the longest scenes ever shown in Doctor Who. More extraordinary because it wasn\u2019t a set piece, but an eviscerating attempt at mending broken father-son bonds. Chibnall tends to ramp up the emotion as a writer, but the Ryan and Graham story has sometimes felt laboured. Here, we got the resolution of the title, as Aaron reveals himself, somewhat surprisingly, as a good egg (though it is lost on me how he finished off the Dalek with a microwave). One thing though: even after a marathon 19 consecutive New Year\u2019s days, it was still out of character for Ryan to be calling Graham \u201cGramps\u201d after choking on the word \u201cGrandad\u201d just weeks ago. Life aboard the Tardis All this Resolution leaves is Yaz, the most underused companion in Doctor Who history. It\u2019s a shame, because Mandip Gill is a talented actor overshadowed by the Graham-Ryan-Grace arc of this series, and the Yaz-centric Demons of the Punjab is widely regarded as the highlight episode. Now, at least, she appears to have something to do \u2013 namely be the Doctor\u2019s PA. It strikes me that their she-mance is the main relationship between the Doctor and her friends; we don\u2019t see much at all between her and the boys. Let\u2019s just hope Yaz gets more to do next series. Fear factor In what will probably be the most controversial element of this episode, history has been rewritten in the shape of a steampunk recon Dalek. The plunger on its right arm has been replaced with a far more menacing claw. It was historically a triumph of writing that a saltshaker armed with a plunger and a whisk could pass for the most dangerous creature in the universe. And Russell T Davies did come up with some imaginatively murderous functions for that plunger. But this reinvention of the Daleks has truly reinstated their menace. Mysteries, questions and continuity There was a lovely throwback to The Day of the Doctor when UNIT\u2019s Black Archive was plundered. But no sooner than that, we discovered that the Unified Intelligence Taskforce had been disbanded. But with UNIT disbanded and Torchwood an awkward distant memory, it is now down to Team Tardis alone to defend the Earth. I hope Kate Stewart and Petronella Osgood got decent military payouts. Deeper into the vortex \u2022 Who said we weren\u2019t getting a Christmas special this year? If you haven\u2019t caught it yet, check out this lovely Santa-themed animation. The last time the Doctor knowingly met Santa was in the 2014 special Last Christmas, with Saint Nick portrayed by Nick Frost. \u2022 I got a Killing Eve frisson from the giant CAPSLOCK location bumpers in the opening sequence, which made me happy. \u2022 By quite some margin, this was Chibnall\u2019s biggest body count of the series. I expect he enjoyed it. Next time That\u2019s all the Doctor Who we\u2019re getting in 2019. We\u2019re promised a new series \u201cearly in 2020\u201d, so at least it\u2019s not the full two-year gap we\u2019ve had in the past. What we do know is that all of Team Tardis will be returning for series 38/12. And since they\u2019re getting into their stride, that\u2019s something to look forward to.",

Swann, who is responsible for most of the institute\u2019s FOI requests, said most rejections were attributed to too many documents being included in the initial search.</p> <p>Swann said most agencies were helpful in refining requests, but others seemed to deliberately cast \u201ca very wide net\u201d for documents.</p> <p>\u201cThe result is so many documents they can\u2019t process it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Last year, Swann filed a FOI request to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, searching for documents that showed the Australian government attempting to secure the support of foreign governments or foreign investors for the Adani coalmine. After much back and forth, Swann was informed no documents matched his search.</p> <p>It was later revealed that ministers had in fact written to the Chinese government welcoming foreign investment and promoting the Adani coalmine. So Swann took the case to the information commissioner.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the information commissioner struggles with the level of resourcing they are given and their internal priorities are not necessarily their own priorities. They struggled with the workload and that\u2019s resulted in that external review is still only just been looked at now.\u201d</p> <p>Swann said he believes most FOI officers were trying to promote a culture of disclosure but were limited in their ability to do so. Without additional support and given the external reviewer is underresourced, agencies lose their incentive to proactively share information.</p> <p>\u201cIntentional or not, the incentive for disclosure is being reduced when the chance of getting a slap on the wrist is reduced.\u201d</p> <p>The crossbench senator Rex Patrick recently introduced amendments to the FOI act, in an attempt to address some of the system\u2019s fundamental failings. The changes failed to win the support of a committee dominated by the two major parties.</p> <p>Patrick said his amendments were designed to make FOI more user-friendly.</p> <p>He said FOI had weaknesses as a democratic tool, questioning how ordinary citizens could use the system effectively, if journalists, politicians and researchers struggled.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the problems we have with FOI is it can take a year, maybe more, to get access to anything with any complexity and information has a temporal value to it. What you really want is real-time access.\u201d</p> <p>His bill seeks to force the government to fill all three roles of information commissioner, privacy commissioner and freedom of information commissioner, which are all currently performed by a single commissioner. Patrick said it would assist applicants seeking FOI reviews in the appeals tribunal and force agencies to reveal their spending on legal advice fighting FOI requests.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my view that everything that the government does, they do so for public purpose and funded by the public service. And therefore everything that is produced by government belongs to the public.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/foiguru/status/1064773593744064512\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Senate committee hearing last week on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Senator_Patrick?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Senator_Patrick</a>&#39;s bill to improve <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FOIA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FOIA</a> reveals two different worlds- some users of the act think things have never been worse; gov witnesses think things are going pretty well.<a href=\"https://t.co/sAIMXSaEJH\">https://t.co/sAIMXSaEJH</a></p>&mdash; Peter Timmins (@foiguru) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/foiguru/status/1064773593744064512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 20, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The federal government is not the only jurisdiction where basic FOI reforms are failing to get traction.</p> <p>In NSW, recent amendments to the state\u2019s government information public access scheme enshrined the right of agencies to ask that requests to be made by \u201csnail mail\u201d.

A month-long investigation into the operation of freedom of information (FOI) laws has identified systemic problems causing vast volumes of government information to be kept secret. Guardian Australia has found: FOI refusals are at their highest level since records began in 2010-11, spiking recently due to the secrecy of the Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility (Naif), the agency that gave conditional approval to lend Adani $1bn in taxpayers\u2019 money. Naif rejected 99.4% of the FOI requests it received.

Journalist and author William Summers has been battling to obtain a copy of Parliament House lunch menus for two months without success because the Department of Parliamentary Services is not beholden to FOI laws. Lockout campaigner and academic Tony Brown was wrongly blocked from receiving a hotelier\u2019s submission to a recent inquiry into Newcastle\u2019s lockout laws because the NSW Department of Industry indicated it had promised the publican it would remain secret, in a submission seen by Guardian Australia. In the past year, heavy redactions have prevented the public knowing whether Australians are fighting as mercenaries in the bitter conflict in Yemen. The dealings between Australian companies and sanctioned elements of the North Korean regime have been hidden, as have communications between Australia and the UK about the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Academics, journalists, crossbenchers and anti-corruption campaigners are now calling for change, urging the government to overhaul Australia\u2019s FOI laws to improve transparency. Lawyer Peter Timmins, a respected FOI expert and former diplomat, wants to see a comprehensive review of Australia\u2019s FOI laws to make them \u201cfit for the 21st century\u201d. \u201cThe government has been sitting on a review since 2013 when Allan Hawke undertook a review of the act and his first recommendation was there needed to be a full review of FOI legislation, and a rewrite of the act in a way that made it more understandable and accessible,\u201d Timmins said. \u201cThat\u2019s never happened.\u201d Last financial year was particularly poor for government transparency.

The commissioner, Angelene Falk, has repeatedly warned the office\u2019s absorption of a growing workload with a limited workforce was creating \u201cchallenges\u201d. \u201cThe workload is increasing, we\u2019ve had increases on freedom of information and privacy year on year, particularly over last three years, and we\u2019ve worked very effectively at identifying efficiencies,\u201d Falk told Senate estimates in October. \u201cBut in terms of our ability to absorb, if you like, the downstream effects of new proposals that occur, that is becoming more challenging.\u201d Australia Institute researcher Tom Swann said he had noticed an increase in delays and rejections, particularly in the past couple of years. Swann, who is responsible for most of the institute\u2019s FOI requests, said most rejections were attributed to too many documents being included in the initial search. Swann said most agencies were helpful in refining requests, but others seemed to deliberately cast \u201ca very wide net\u201d for documents. \u201cThe result is so many documents they can\u2019t process it,\u201d he said. Last year, Swann filed a FOI request to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, searching for documents that showed the Australian government attempting to secure the support of foreign governments or foreign investors for the Adani coalmine. After much back and forth, Swann was informed no documents matched his search. It was later revealed that ministers had in fact written to the Chinese government welcoming foreign investment and promoting the Adani coalmine. So Swann took the case to the information commissioner. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the information commissioner struggles with the level of resourcing they are given and their internal priorities are not necessarily their own priorities. They struggled with the workload and that\u2019s resulted in that external review is still only just been looked at now.\u201d Swann said he believes most FOI officers were trying to promote a culture of disclosure but were limited in their ability to do so. Without additional support and given the external reviewer is underresourced, agencies lose their incentive to proactively share information. \u201cIntentional or not, the incentive for disclosure is being reduced when the chance of getting a slap on the wrist is reduced.\u201d The crossbench senator Rex Patrick recently introduced amendments to the FOI act, in an attempt to address some of the system\u2019s fundamental failings. The changes failed to win the support of a committee dominated by the two major parties. Patrick said his amendments were designed to make FOI more user-friendly. He said FOI had weaknesses as a democratic tool, questioning how ordinary citizens could use the system effectively, if journalists, politicians and researchers struggled. \u201cOne of the problems we have with FOI is it can take a year, maybe more, to get access to anything with any complexity and information has a temporal value to it. What you really want is real-time access.\u201d His bill seeks to force the government to fill all three roles of information commissioner, privacy commissioner and freedom of information commissioner, which are all currently performed by a single commissioner. Patrick said it would assist applicants seeking FOI reviews in the appeals tribunal and force agencies to reveal their spending on legal advice fighting FOI requests. \u201cIt\u2019s my view that everything that the government does, they do so for public purpose and funded by the public service. And therefore everything that is produced by government belongs to the public.\u201d The federal government is not the only jurisdiction where basic FOI reforms are failing to get traction. In NSW, recent amendments to the state\u2019s government information public access scheme enshrined the right of agencies to ask that requests to be made by \u201csnail mail\u201d. The opposition, led by the shadow attorney general, Paul Lynch, had urged the government to compel government agencies to take requests electronically. \u2022 This reporting is supported by the Susan McKinnon Foundation through the Guardian Civic Journalism Trust",

China\u2019s likely view of our foreign interference laws is off-limits, department rules</h2> <p>Foreign affairs is always a tricky topic to illuminate with FOI. Documents <a href=\"http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/foia1982222/s33.html\">affecting the relations with a foreign state</a> are kept from the reach of the public by Australia\u2019s Freedom of Information Act. So it\u2019s perhaps not surprising that an FOI request for documents about the impact of Australia\u2019s foreign interference crackdown on relations with China was not particularly successful.</p> <p>But the release is particularly galling for the heavy use of redactions.

Coal and climate change not matters of public interest?</h2> <p>One of the most prohibitive aspects of FOI is the cost. Apply for documents, and you will almost certainly be charged a fee. It\u2019s often not a lot, maybe $200, but it\u2019s just enough to deter shrinking newsrooms and smaller not-for-profits, who can\u2019t risk wasting money on a request that may prove useless.</p> <p>To get past fees, media agencies routinely rely on having them waived because the material is in the public interest. It doesn\u2019t always go to plan.</p> <p>In one recent case, Australian Associated Press argued the government ought to release documents on Australia\u2019s support for a new coal mine in Papua New Guinea because coal was linked with higher emissions and climate change, a matter of clear public interest. The journalist argued:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I contend it is both in the general public interest and in the interest of a substantial section of the public for these documents to be released.</p> <p>Climate change is a huge problem facing the world.

It decided the fee must be paid and charged $200 to process seven documents. Again, just enough to deter reporters with shrinking newsroom budgets.</p> <p>So AAP took it to the tribunal. It didn\u2019t take the tribunal long to decide that coal and climate change were, in fact, matters of public interest.

The United Nations has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/28/all-sides-in-yemen-may-be-responsible-for-war-crimes-say-un-experts\">accused the coalition led by the UAE and Saudi Arabia</a> of killing thousands of civilians in airstrikes, torturing detainees, using child soldiers and raping civilians.</p> <p>The defence department was asked for details on Australia\u2019s arms exports to the UAE. The <a href=\"http://www.defence.gov.au/FOI/Docs/Disclosures/090_1819_Documents.pdf\">released documents were so heavily redacted</a> that they were practically useless, unless you know precisely <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-13/australias-secret-backing-for-nations-fighting-bloody-yemen-war/10600912\">what you are looking for</a>.

      "bodyText": "Jair Bolsonaro has announced Brazil\u2019s \u201cliberation from socialism, inverted values, the bloated state and political correctness\u201d after being sworn in as the country\u2019s 42nd president. His words delighted a crowd of more than 100,000 \u2013 many of whom had travelled to its modernist capital for the event, convinced the far-right populist can rescue their troubled country from virulent corruption, rising violent crime and economic doldrums. The former army captain and his wife Michelle waved to crowds from an open-topped Rolls-Royce before he and his vice-president, retired army general Hamilton Mour\u00e3o, were sworn in at congress. In a brief speech to the chamber of deputies, Bolsonaro thanked God for surviving from a near-fatal knife attack during the election campaign and invited lawmakers to help Brazil free itself from \u201ccorruption, criminality and economic irresponsibility and ideological submission\u201d. \u201cWe have a unique opportunity before us to reconstruct our country and rescue the hope of our compatriots,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to unite the people, rescue the family, respect religions and our Judeo-Christian tradition, combat gender ideology, conserving our values.\u201d He also referred to campaign promises such as freeing up gun possession. \u201cGood citizens deserve the means to defend themselves,\u201d he said. Bolsonaro said he was counting on congress support to provide \u201clegal support\u201d for police to do their work; he has promised impunity for police who kill criminals. \u201cThey deserve it and must be respected,\u201d he said. Bolsonaro has enjoyed the support of Brazil\u2019s powerful agribusiness sector, which he said will have an \u201cincrease in efficiency\u201d with \u201cless bureaucracy\u201d \u2013 words which will alarm environmentalists and indigenous activists concerned by his plans to streamline environmental licensing and allow commercial mining and farming on protected indigenous reserves. These fears seem justified, in one of his first acts as president, just hours after being sworn in, Bolsonaro took the power to identify and demarcate indigenous reserves from the National Indian Foundation (Funai), giving it to the ministry of agriculture, according to local media reports. He also took aim at the leftist Workers\u2019 party he has painted as communists responsible for all Brazil\u2019s ills, from crime to corruption. \u201cIrresponsibility conducted us to the worst ethical, moral and economic crisis in our history,\u201d he said. Minutes afterwards, Donald Trump tweeted that Bolsonaro had made a \u201cgreat inauguration speech\u201d, adding: \u201cThe U.S.A is with you!\u201d Shortly afterwards, Bolsonaro\u2019s Twitter account replied: \u201cDear Mr. President @realDonaldTrump, I truly appreciate your words of encouragement.

He rode a wave of righteous anger to power provoked by sweeping corruption scandals and economic recession that Bolsonaro blamed on the leftist Workers\u2019 party that ran Brazil for 13 years.

However the prospect of Russia being banned from the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo seems slim after the president of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, used his new year message to say the Russia Olympic Committee had already been punished enough. \u201cIn Pyeongchang we sanctioned the systematic manipulation of the anti-doping system in Russia during the Olympic Winter Games Sochi 2014,\u201d said Bach . \u201cThe IOC sanctioned those entities involved, proportional to their levels of responsibility \u2013 with its suspension from Pyeongchang 2018, the Russian Olympic Committee has served its sanction.\u201d Many athletes, however, remain angry that Wada and the IOC has not been tougher on Russia given the country has never formally admitted to a sophisticated state-sponsored doping programme involving more than 1,000 athletes and 30 sports. That anger was reflected by a statement from the UK Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s athlete commission, which joined Usada in calling for Russia to again be declared non-compliant. \u201cUnfortunately the Russian government has clearly not fulfilled its promise,\u201d it said. \u201cThe Russian state need to prove unequivocally that they have learned from the biggest doping scandal under Wada\u2019s watch, and that they will from this date forward be committed to a drug-free, transparent regime across international sport. Otherwise the Wada compliance review committee and the Wada executive committee must now immediately declare Rusada non-compliant. \u201cWada\u2019s leadership has the opportunity to stand up for the interests of athletes, their families, their fans and their sport. In the name of sport, it is time to do what is right.\u201d",

It comes three months after the brutal killing of the Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi \u2013 which US senators have blamed on the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman \u2013 and as the war in Yemen continues to devastate the country. The American comedian Hasan Minhaj was critical of the Saudi heir in an episode of the standup show Patriot Act, delivering a wide-ranging monologue mocking the Saudis\u2019 evolving account of what happened inside the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul in October, when the journalist was killed. \u201cThe Saudis were struggling to explain his disappearance: they said he left the consulate safely, then they used a body double to make it seem like he was alive,\u201d Minhaj, an American-born Muslim of Indian descent, said. \u201cAt one point they were saying he died in a fist fight, Jackie Chan-style.

It added that the Saudi telecoms regulator cited a cyber-crime law that states that \u201cproduction, preparation, transmission, or storage of material impinging on public order, religious values, public morals, and privacy, through the information network or computers\u201d is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine not exceeding SR3m ($800,000). The episode can still be seen in other parts of the world \u2013 and in Saudi Arabia on YouTube \u2013 yet it is likely to raise pressing new questions about the limits of free online expression and the responsibility of western companies to uphold liberal values.

      "bodyText": "And with that, farewell. Enjoy the remainder of your New Year\u2019s Day. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow with coverage of the Wednesday games. Cheers for reading! Ben Fisher was at the Cardiff City Stadium. Here\u2019s his match report from there: Here\u2019s the updated league table. Spurs almost certainly won\u2019t win the league, but they\u2019re six points behind Liverpool and if Manchester City win on Thursday then we\u2019ll at least have a proper title race. Cardiff could be back into the bottom three if results go against them tomorrow. Well, that was pretty straightforward for Spurs. The game was basically over by the 12th minute, when Eriksen made things 2-0, and finished off by Son 14 minutes later. You could say that Cardiff didn\u2019t turn up and Neil Warnock is likely to be pretty miffed by the whole thing, but this may well have just been one of those games where the better collection of players won. Peeeeeeeeeeep. 90 mins + 2: Big diagonal from Sissoko finds Rose, who bombs forward like Spurs desperately need a goal. The ball finds its way to Kane on the edge of the box, he twists hither and thither looking for some space, which he finds and shoots left-footed, but it goes a bit too high and a bit too wide. 90 mins + 1: Mendez-Laing tries a cross from the right, finds Morrison but his header goes wide. 90 mins: Three minutes of added time to come. 89 mins: Sissoko drives down the right and is slipped in by Kane. The Frenchman tip-toes his way into the area, weighs up the passing options then shoots, but sends it way over the bar. 86 mins: Well look who we have here: it\u2019s big Fernando Llorente, earning himself some appearance money by replacing Alli for the last few minutes. 85 mins: \u201cDid you know that Son\u2019s &amp; Etheridge\u2019s national sides (South Korea &amp; The Philippines) are in the same group in the Asian Cup?\u201d writes David Spurr. I did not know that actually, but they won\u2019t actually face each other - Etheridge has been left out of the Philippines squad by your pal and mine Sven Goran Eriksson so he can concentrate on his Cardiff duties. 83 mins: Hoilett tries a hugely ambitious shot from way out, but is sails over. Spurs then attack after some hairy passing in their own box, Alli finds Eriksen with a fine through-ball, Eriksen then in turn plays in Kane but he tries to take it round Etheridge with no joy. Kane went down, with no hope of actually winning a penalty, and he might have been lucky to get away without a telling off/booking for a dive. 82 mins: Gunnarson drives into the box from the right, he challenges with Skipp and both men take a handful of the other\u2019s shirt. Gunnarson goes down and half-expects a penalty, but at the very least wants a corner after Alli put the ball behind. But no, goal-kick apparently. 80 mins: Cardiff in the wars: Gunnarson and Bamba both go down separately requiring treatment, but both look like they\u2019ll be OK to carry on. 79 mins: Alli takes a touch so delightful that, if you could award goals during games based only on aesthetics, would almost be worth a hat-trick. Eriksen skimmed a pass from deep out to Alli on the left, and he flicks it first time, with the outside of his right foot, inside and past Manga. He takes a little too long over the shot and it\u2019s blocked, but by golly that was lovely. 77 mins: \u201cDo you think the lack of subs thing relates to Spurs\u2019 main problem in any title challenge?\u201d writes Adam Hirst, who I should say sent his email before they actually did make a change. \u201cThey\u2019re good for the first team but nowhere near the others for the quality of the squad members. That\u2019s why they didn\u2019t rotate for the Wolves game and suffered for it.\u201d 76 mins: Change for Spurs, as Oliver Skipp replaces Son. 72 mins: Before that corner is taken, Cardiff take off Bobby Decordova Reid and replace him with Nathaniel Mendez-Laing. After it\u2019s taken, Morrison rises and heads into the six yard box, Gunnarson attempts to help it on with his head, misses, but still forces Lloris into a save after the ball slides off his back. What an enjoyably comical goal that would have been. 71 mins: Basically all of Cardiff\u2019s threat in the second-half has come from the left and Hoilett: he jinks down the flank and crosses, which he mishits but Lloris still has to palm the ball over the bar, lest he let a flukey one in. 69 mins: Quite surprising that Spurs haven\u2019t made some changes by now. Most of the key men will get a rest for the FA Cup game against Tranmere, but in a season where they\u2019re still playing in four competitions, every chance to have a breather should be taken. 67 mins: Rose feeds Kane in the box who is being so tightly marked by Manga the Cardiff man is basically in his shorts. Kane still manages to wiggle free enough to shoot, but Manga blocks it. 66 mins: Sensational then awful stuff from Bamba, who shimmies out of a tight situation with a Cruyff turn, only for his pass to be intercepted and set Son away. However, he gets the ball caught under his feet a bit and his shot, after a deflection, is saved by Etheridge. 64 mins: Kane again, and he has two shots this time after a low cross from Son. The second is blocked in the area by Bamba, speaking of whom... 62 mins: Kane advances down the right channel and launches an ambitious ol\u2019 shot from about 30 yards out. It goes not a million miles wide, but wide nonetheless. 61 mins: There\u2019s Hoilett again, chasing Sanchez down and whipping the ball off his toes. However, he has to wait for support and when it arrives, his cross into the middle doesn\u2019t beat the first man. 58 mins: Camarasa has sunk to the turf and seemingly decided that he can no longer continue. Not sure what the problem is but Joe Ralls will replace him. 55 mins: Hoilett has been sparky since coming on: he clips a cross to the back post from the left but it\u2019s just too strong for any of the Cardiff attackers. Spurs counter at pace, but the crowd are delighted as Arter stops Kane with a hard but fair challenge, and then again as Gunnarsson muscles Alli out. 53 mins: Bamba takes Son out by treading heavily on his foot while trying to nip in front of him to take the ball, and looks absolutely mystified why a free-kick is given, so you can imagine his reaction after a yellow card is flashed. Entirely correct decision, though. 52 mins: Chance for Cardiff: Paterson drifts out to the right wing and his cross is deflected, bounces around the box and somehow finds its way to Hoilett at the back stick. He gets in front of Tripper and heads towards goal, but Lloris dives to his right to save. 49 mins: Sky are trying to keep us all watching this one, but it\u2019s optimistic. Obviously you should continue following this blog, though. What else are you going to do? 48 mins: Sanchez goes to ground as if taken out by a grouse hunter with a shotgun, but at worst he was grazed by Reid as the Cardiff man slipped over. Curious little episode, that. 46 mins: We\u2019re away again. Are we about to witness the comeback of the season? No, almost certainly not. The players are back out. Cardiff are making a change: Josh Murphy has been hooked, and Junior Hoilett is on in his stead. Too easy for Spurs. Cardiff are doing exactly what Neil Warnock told them not to, which is to allow a big team to trample all over them in the early stages and rendering the remainder of the game entirely pointless. After the Manchester United game the other week Warnock said Cardiff were lucky not to lose by seven or eight: looks similar this time. Peeeeeeeep. 44 mins: Spurs winding down the half by keeping the ball for a long spell. You\u2019d imagine they\u2019ll do this for most of the second-half too. 41 mins: Cardiff get a free-kick out on the left which Camarasa booms over to the back post looking for Paterson, but again a defender (Alli, this time) gets in front of him to head away. On Sky Alan Smith, who would know about these things, reckons Paterson isn\u2019t attacking these headers with enough gusto and decisiveness. It is worth remembering that Paterson is still learning the centre-forward game in the Premier League, which is a bit like learning to fly in an A380. 39 mins: Spurs have a corner from the right which is half-cleared by Cardiff, and they then win a free-kick after Sanchez barges Cunningham to the floor. On the touchline, Warnock already looks like a manager thinking about other things. 38 mins: Here\u2019s Jeremy Dresner again: \u201cSpurs can still challenge themselves by bringing on the Skipps of the squad and seeing if those players can hold and slow down a game second half.\u201d You\u2019d think that if managers were allowed to make 11 subs, Pochettino would do exactly that at the break. 37 mins: Kane lays one off to Alli but the midfielder can\u2019t collect it properly. 34 mins: Football is a team game, the sum of individual abilities rarely actually directly translating to how a match pans out. This, however, looks like Champions League quality players beating Championship ones. 32 mins: Warnock will presumably be spitting feathers at this - not so much that they\u2019re losing, more that they\u2019re doing exactly what he warned them not to do, which was to essentially surrender the game in the early stages. They try to get back into things with a corner, but Camarasa\u2019s delivery is dreadful. 31 mins: Sometimes football is weird. 29 mins: Son goes pretty close to another, rifling an always-rising shot over the bar from the edge of the box. 28 mins: This is interesting. Although the pitch won\u2019t be a problem: the new White Hart Lane is so hi-tech that they have a completely separate retractable field for NFL use, hosting those games always having been part of the business plan. 26 mins: Sissoko wins the ball from Cunningham in midfield, passes to Kane who lays it off to Son. On the right side of the box, Son is given too much time by Morrison to shoot, which he does low and across the keeper, into the bottom corner. Too easy. 25 mins: Spurs have been knocking the ball around for fun so far. After a few such passes Trippier slides it down the right side of the area for Alli, who tries to check back in and set up a shot, but Bamba swoops in and tackles. 23 mins: Not saying they think the game is already over, but the Spurs fans are doing that thing where they go through the repertoire of songs about each individual player in the team. 20 mins: Jeremy Dresner is a fan of that Eriksen goal: \u201cEriksen didn\u2019t just give the keeper the eyes he had time to negotiate a deal on the eyes with the keepers agent. Write a book about that deal then put the ball in the net.\u201d 17 mins: That was Eriksen\u2019s 19th goal from outside the area since joining Spurs in 2013 - apparently no player has got more such strikes in that time. 14 mins: Warnock looked resolutely unimpressed on the touchline after that goal, as he inevitably would be. Not just that they\u2019re 2-0 down and the game is basically gone by the 12th minute, but while Eriksen moved brilliantly to set up his shot, the Cardiff defence did stand off him rather. 12 mins: Kane slides a pass through to Son, who squares to Eriksen. He has to check slightly as Arter half-blocks the pass, but he creates a little space for himself with the most subtle shuffle on the left side of the area, about 20 yards out, and drags a shot inside the near post when Cardiff keeper Neil Etheridge was probably expecting him to curl it the other way. That actually was a really terrific goal. 11 mins: Murphy stands a lovely hanging cross up to the back post looking for Paterson, but Rose defends brilliantly by getting there first and heading behind, knowing he was going to get clattered by the big Scot straight afterwards. 9 mins: Son attacks down the left but after he cuts back a pass to Alli in the middle, a heavy touch from the England man gives Cardiff a chance to counter. They don\u2019t do much with that counter, but the early signs are that they\u2019ve responded reasonably well to that early goal. 7 mins: Maybe Morrison was thrown off his game by an adorable child. 5 mins: One for you fact fans: Kane has now scored against every Premier League team he\u2019s faced. 4 mins: Quite apart from the manner of the goal, the comic timing could hardly have been better, Neil Warnock\u2019s pre-match words about not conceding a goal in the first three minutes again hanging in the air in a speech bubble. 3 mins: What a shambles of a goal. Trippier swings a cross into the box, it bobbles around a bit, Morrison tries to clear it but his effort gets as far as Harry Kane\u2019s shin, from where it bounces into the net. They all count. A screamer! Sort of. 1 min: We\u2019re off. Cardiff are in all blue and kicking from left to right. Spurs are wearing white jerseys, dark blue knickerbockers and white stockings. The teams are out. The atmosphere sounds good. Calum Paterson\u2019s facial hair is expanding by the week. We\u2019re on. Alex Scott on Sky is making the point that Son Heung-min is in such good form that he\u2019s impossible to leave out. Which is true, on the face of things, but there was a reasonable case to give him a rest in this one, with the longer-term in mind. He\u2019ll be off to the Asian Cup after the Manchester United game and will probably come back absolutely knackered, physically and mentally in February some time. Spurs will need him at the back end of the season, so every chance they get to give him a day off now, they need. Mauricio Pochettino speaks: \u201cI see the possibilities like always. The decision is to be strong and try to win the game. We have a similar XI to the one against Wolverhampton, but always our mentality is to win. We have to be protagonists and try to dominate the game. The challenge for us is to recover the feelings we lost in the last 20 minutes against Wolves.\u201d Neil Warnock speaks: \u201cWe\u2019re obviously really pleased about [being out of the relegation zone]. We were favourites to finish bottom. We\u2019ve just got to do better than the last time we played a big team - we got battered against Man United. We\u2019re a lot more confident, we\u2019re playing better football, but it\u2019s games like this that test us. We\u2019ve got to be better than against United, giving them a start like conceding a goal after three minutes.\u201d It\u2019s a pretty obvious thing to say but the job Neil Warnock has done at Cardiff has been utterly phenomenal. The team playing today looks, simply on the basis of talent and prior reputation, like a mid-table Championship side: to have them in the Premier League in the first place is exceptional, but for them to be outside of the relegation zone with over half of the season gone is utterly extraordinary. Only Jurgen Klopp can rival him for manager of the season so far. \u201cWow,\u201d exclaims Marie Meyer. \u201cThat is some theory you advanced in your intro. So remarkable it deserves its own theme tune.\u201d That Spurs side is surprising and not surprising at the same time. On the one hand it\u2019s their best available XI, but on the other the only change from the Wolves defeat is Danny Rose coming in for Ben Davies. Presumably the hope is to get this one boxed off early, maybe make a few subs then rest the big guns against Tranmere in the FA Cup. I\u2019ve written the team out in a 4-2-3-1 but it might equally be a 4-4-2 with a midfield diamond. Cardiff City Etheridge; Manga, Morrison, Bamba, Cunningham; Gunnarson, Arter; Murphy, Camarasa, Decordova-Reid; Paterson. Subs: Smithies, Peltier, Bennett, Ralls, Mendez-Laing, Madine, Hoilett. Tottenham Hotspur Lloris; Trippier, Alderweireld, Sanchez, Rose; Winks, Sissoko; Eriksen, Dele, Son; Kane. Subs: Gazzaniga, Davies, Foyth, Walker-Peters, Skipp, Lucas, Llorente. Referee: Kevin Friend (Leicestershire) It might not be the end of the world for Tottenham if they lose tonight. In the medium/long-term, at least. Not ideal, sure, but they\u2019re not going to win the league anyway and probably will still finish in the top four, assuming a defeat doesn\u2019t trigger a complete collapse. But a couple of \u2018well-timed\u2019 losses, following being turned over by Wolves at the weekend, might introduce a bit of urgency into their transfer window. Plus, it might make some other clubs a little less likely to go after their manager, you never know. Maybe that\u2019s nonsense. After all - and here\u2019s a hot take showing a deep understanding of the game for you - winning games is generally better than losing games. And the potential up sides mentioned do rely on Daniel Levy not being extremely stubborn, which is optimistic. But still. There\u2019s every chance Cardiff could give them a bop on the nose too. Neil Warnock\u2019s side are good at home and are likely to attack Spurs, which was a problem against Wolves. Still, let\u2019s all rub our eyes and welcome in the New Year with the Chris Gunter Derby. Stay tuned. Kick-off: 17.30 GMT",

      "body": "<p>Harry Kane was again on the receiving end of new year\u2019s honours after helping Tottenham Hotspur turn up the heat on their title rivals by snatching back second place in the Premier League. Four days after being awarded an MBE, Kane opened the scoring after 141 seconds and, in doing so, broke his duck against Cardiff City at the fourth time of asking, having netted against every other one of the 27 top-flight teams he has faced.</p> <p>Kane was the catalyst in a game that was over inside half an hour, feeding Son Heung-min for Spurs\u2019 slick third after having a hand in the buildup to a typically classy Christian Eriksen strike from the edge of the box.</p> <p>Jolted back into being the hunter as opposed to the hunted, Spurs seemed to enjoy themselves. Mauricio Pochettino had challenged his players to rise to the role of protagonists here and, while they remain six points off the summit having played an extra game, they issued a timely reminder to Manchester City and Liverpool, who meet on Thursday, that they are determined to make life as interesting as possible.</p> <p>Pochettino will be a keen observer \u2013 a neutral, he said, though victory for Pep Guardiola\u2019s side would surely enhance Spurs\u2019 chances in the title race. After<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/29/tottenham-wolves-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\"> slipping up against Wolves</a>, a trip to south Wales had the makings of another difficult evening against a promoted team. It proved anything but as Spurs, impeccably led by Kane, blew away a desperately porous defence with three goals in 26 first-half minutes, feasting on a calamitous Cardiff collapse. Kane got the ball rolling before Eriksen\u2019s assassin-like finish and an arrowed effort by Son sealed the most routine of victories.</p> <p>For Cardiff, this was yet another damning defeat against one of the league\u2019s big-hitters, with Spurs sapping the life out of a side hoping to build on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/29/leicester-city-cardiff-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">character-building win at Leicester</a>.</p> <p>Cardiff\u2019s record against the league\u2019s so-called \u201cbig six\u201d was naturally a concern, having lost their previous 14 meetings, the latest of which was a 5-1 \u201cbattering\u201d, as Neil Warnock put it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/22/cardiff-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">against Manchester United</a> last month.</p> <p>He would have been right to fear this would go the same way when Kane struck the opener, with the ball bobbling in off his right shin after Sean Morrison\u2019s failed clearance under pressure from Dele Alli, before Eriksen doubled Spurs\u2019 lead on 12 minutes. Warnock had warned his players \u201cnot to breathe\u201d on the opposition but they afforded them too much respect altogether. This was so easy for Spurs. The pained grimace on Warnock\u2019s face said as much.</p> <p>Cardiff passed up their best spell before Spurs\u2019 killer second, the returning Danny Rose leaping highest at the back post to head away Josh Murphy\u2019s high cross with Callum Paterson, the Cardiff forward, for company, a minute after Toby Alderweireld cut out Murphy\u2019s low ball.</p> <p>Kane, who started and finished the opener and had a hand in the second and third too, freed Moussa Sissoko down the right with a spearing, sweeping through-ball. Sissoko centred for Son, who fed Eriksen. Harry Arter went to ground as the Dane composed himself, teasing Bruno Ecuele Manga by dragging the ball back and forth, and giving Neil Etheridge the eyes as he shaped to bend an effort into the far corner before rolling a cunning low strike inside the near post.</p> <p>Any of the feelgood factor that Cardiff had fostered from that last-gasp victory at Leicester last weekend had certainly wilted by the time Son added a simple third. Kane was again involved, effortlessly pushing a first-time pass into the path of his teammate after more good running by the formidable Sissoko down Tottenham\u2019s right. Son dispatched another rising effort over the bar moments later but it did not matter. The game was done and dusted with an hour to play.</p> <p>Kane would have scored a second himself but for a superb block by Morrison, the Cardiff captain, midway through the second half. When Spurs did opt to grind through the gears, with the game already out of sight, Kane was at the heart of everything. Sol Bamba ran into trouble on the halfway line, with Sissoko cutting out his hopeful pass and picking out the striker. Again Cardiff were exposed, Etheridge faced with four Spurs forwards, but back came Bamba to deflect Son\u2019s low effort on to the Cardiff goalkeeper\u2019s shoulder and away.</p> <p>Then Aron Gunnarsson acrobatically denied a probing Alli in the box. Cardiff had failed this test miserably but, with 15 minutes left to play, it was time for Spurs to experiment. Fernando Llorente made a late cameo, in place of Alli, while the 18-year-old Oliver Skipp replaced Son, the academy graduate gaining some more valuable minutes before his likely involvement against Tranmere Rovers in the FA Cup on Friday. The League Two side could do with making that match somewhat less of a stroll.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Harry Kane was again on the receiving end of new year\u2019s honours after helping Tottenham Hotspur turn up the heat on their title rivals by snatching back second place in the Premier League. Four days after being awarded an MBE, Kane opened the scoring after 141 seconds and, in doing so, broke his duck against Cardiff City at the fourth time of asking, having netted against every other one of the 27 top-flight teams he has faced. Kane was the catalyst in a game that was over inside half an hour, feeding Son Heung-min for Spurs\u2019 slick third after having a hand in the buildup to a typically classy Christian Eriksen strike from the edge of the box. Jolted back into being the hunter as opposed to the hunted, Spurs seemed to enjoy themselves. Mauricio Pochettino had challenged his players to rise to the role of protagonists here and, while they remain six points off the summit having played an extra game, they issued a timely reminder to Manchester City and Liverpool, who meet on Thursday, that they are determined to make life as interesting as possible. Pochettino will be a keen observer \u2013 a neutral, he said, though victory for Pep Guardiola\u2019s side would surely enhance Spurs\u2019 chances in the title race. After slipping up against Wolves, a trip to south Wales had the makings of another difficult evening against a promoted team. It proved anything but as Spurs, impeccably led by Kane, blew away a desperately porous defence with three goals in 26 first-half minutes, feasting on a calamitous Cardiff collapse. Kane got the ball rolling before Eriksen\u2019s assassin-like finish and an arrowed effort by Son sealed the most routine of victories. For Cardiff, this was yet another damning defeat against one of the league\u2019s big-hitters, with Spurs sapping the life out of a side hoping to build on a character-building win at Leicester. Cardiff\u2019s record against the league\u2019s so-called \u201cbig six\u201d was naturally a concern, having lost their previous 14 meetings, the latest of which was a 5-1 \u201cbattering\u201d, as Neil Warnock put it, against Manchester United last month. He would have been right to fear this would go the same way when Kane struck the opener, with the ball bobbling in off his right shin after Sean Morrison\u2019s failed clearance under pressure from Dele Alli, before Eriksen doubled Spurs\u2019 lead on 12 minutes. Warnock had warned his players \u201cnot to breathe\u201d on the opposition but they afforded them too much respect altogether. This was so easy for Spurs. The pained grimace on Warnock\u2019s face said as much. Cardiff passed up their best spell before Spurs\u2019 killer second, the returning Danny Rose leaping highest at the back post to head away Josh Murphy\u2019s high cross with Callum Paterson, the Cardiff forward, for company, a minute after Toby Alderweireld cut out Murphy\u2019s low ball. Kane, who started and finished the opener and had a hand in the second and third too, freed Moussa Sissoko down the right with a spearing, sweeping through-ball. Sissoko centred for Son, who fed Eriksen. Harry Arter went to ground as the Dane composed himself, teasing Bruno Ecuele Manga by dragging the ball back and forth, and giving Neil Etheridge the eyes as he shaped to bend an effort into the far corner before rolling a cunning low strike inside the near post. Any of the feelgood factor that Cardiff had fostered from that last-gasp victory at Leicester last weekend had certainly wilted by the time Son added a simple third. Kane was again involved, effortlessly pushing a first-time pass into the path of his teammate after more good running by the formidable Sissoko down Tottenham\u2019s right. Son dispatched another rising effort over the bar moments later but it did not matter. The game was done and dusted with an hour to play. Kane would have scored a second himself but for a superb block by Morrison, the Cardiff captain, midway through the second half. When Spurs did opt to grind through the gears, with the game already out of sight, Kane was at the heart of everything. Sol Bamba ran into trouble on the halfway line, with Sissoko cutting out his hopeful pass and picking out the striker. Again Cardiff were exposed, Etheridge faced with four Spurs forwards, but back came Bamba to deflect Son\u2019s low effort on to the Cardiff goalkeeper\u2019s shoulder and away. Then Aron Gunnarsson acrobatically denied a probing Alli in the box. Cardiff had failed this test miserably but, with 15 minutes left to play, it was time for Spurs to experiment. Fernando Llorente made a late cameo, in place of Alli, while the 18-year-old Oliver Skipp replaced Son, the academy graduate gaining some more valuable minutes before his likely involvement against Tranmere Rovers in the FA Cup on Friday. The League Two side could do with making that match somewhat less of a stroll.",

However, Ronan Curtis headed Pompey back in front five minutes later and they held on for maximum points as the visitors dropped to the bottom of the table. Second-placed Luton were held in a goalless draw at home to Barnsley, who remain fourth as a result. </p> <p>Sunderland top scorer Josh Maja fired Aiden McGeady\u2019s assist into the bottom corner midway through the first half to hand his side a 1-0 win at Blackpool to strengthen their hold on third. </p> <p>Lee Novak netted a brace as high-flying Peterborough suffered a shock 2-0 defeat against lowly Scunthorpe and slipped out of the play-off places as a result, while the Iron remain in the relegation zone on goal difference. <br></p> <p>John Marquis scored twice to make it 18 goals for the season as Doncaster moved into the play-offs thanks to a comprehensive 5-0 victory at home to Rochdale. Alfie May headed the hosts ahead in the opening minute, while Ali Crawford doubled their tally midway through the first half before Marquis netted either side of half-time and James Coppinger\u2019s late header added the gloss. </p> <p>Bradford made it four wins from their last five league games to move up to 20th following a comfortable 3-0 victory at home to 10-man Accrington. Lewis O\u2019Brien opened the scoring as he fired Eoin Doyle\u2019s assist into the top corner from outside the 18-yard box before the latter added a second on the half-hour for his fourth goal in five games. That second goal came moments after Offrande Zanzala was sent off for the away side, while Connor Wood scored a third just after the break to seal the win. </p> <p>Charlton edged Walsall 2-1 thanks to Karlan Ahearne-Grant\u2019s 12th goal this term just six minutes in and Lyle Taylor\u2019s ninth-minute penalty, while Andy Cook reduced the deficit two minutes into the second half. </p> <p>Plymouth moved off the bottom thanks to a 3-0 win over Oxford with Antoni Sarcevic on target after nine minutes before Ruben Lameiras added a brace. Sam Mantom and Taylor Moore scored as 10-man Southend claimed a 2-0 victory over Gillingham after losing Theo Robinson to a second yellow card late on. </p> <p>Coventry moved up a spot to eighth after a 2-0 win at Wycombe following Conor Chaplin\u2019s opening penalty and an effort from Jonson Clarke-Harris. Bristol Rovers and Burton played out a 0-0 draw while Shrewsbury\u2019s clash at home to Fleetwood was also goalless.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c2ba140e4b0cebe7617e405\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-01T17:22:26.166Z\">5.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Aitor Karanka talks to Sky, after his Nottingham Forest side beat Leeds 4-2:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was difficult to explain because when they equalised, when they came back, I thought it was going to be difficult but the energy, the power was amazing and in the same way we did against Villa, today at home has been amazing for me, the players and the crowd.

Here\u2019s a report on Nottingham Forest\u2019s rollicking win over Leeds: Defender Denis Odoi said the defeat was a \u201creality check\u201d for Fulham. \u201cI think we showed we can play football but it\u2019s a reality check also,\u201d he said. \u201cAt 2-1 we were still pushing. We thought 2-2 might be possible. After 3-1 it was just disappointment.\u201d The Cottagers remain 19th but are just a point behind the two sides above them, although having now played a match more. Odoi added: \u201cThe league is still on and we have every chance to stay in it.\u201d Here\u2019s Claudio Ranieri on Fulham\u2019s defeat at Arsenal: First half an hour before the first goal we created two great chances, and the Arsenal crowd was, \u2018Oh, what\u2019s happening?\u2019 and started to boo their players. But their first chance, they scored because we made mistakes in the middle of the box. Second half, again mistakes. After we reopened the match, and created another two chances to draw the match. But when you make mistakes \u2026 after were are a little tired, and we don\u2019t have the quality of Arsenal. I think we have to improve some things, but I\u2019m very pleased with my players because they tried to do their best. That is important. Here\u2019s the Press Association\u2019s League One review: Portsmouth extended their lead at the top of Sky Bet League One to five points after edging a late 2-1 victory over struggling AFC Wimbledon at Fratton Park. Jamal Lowe netted his third goal in two games with an eighth-minute opener for the hosts but his effort was cancelled out by Kwesi Appiah 15 minutes from time to threaten a shock result. However, Ronan Curtis headed Pompey back in front five minutes later and they held on for maximum points as the visitors dropped to the bottom of the table. Second-placed Luton were held in a goalless draw at home to Barnsley, who remain fourth as a result. Sunderland top scorer Josh Maja fired Aiden McGeady\u2019s assist into the bottom corner midway through the first half to hand his side a 1-0 win at Blackpool to strengthen their hold on third. Lee Novak netted a brace as high-flying Peterborough suffered a shock 2-0 defeat against lowly Scunthorpe and slipped out of the play-off places as a result, while the Iron remain in the relegation zone on goal difference. John Marquis scored twice to make it 18 goals for the season as Doncaster moved into the play-offs thanks to a comprehensive 5-0 victory at home to Rochdale. Alfie May headed the hosts ahead in the opening minute, while Ali Crawford doubled their tally midway through the first half before Marquis netted either side of half-time and James Coppinger\u2019s late header added the gloss. Bradford made it four wins from their last five league games to move up to 20th following a comfortable 3-0 victory at home to 10-man Accrington. Lewis O\u2019Brien opened the scoring as he fired Eoin Doyle\u2019s assist into the top corner from outside the 18-yard box before the latter added a second on the half-hour for his fourth goal in five games. That second goal came moments after Offrande Zanzala was sent off for the away side, while Connor Wood scored a third just after the break to seal the win. Charlton edged Walsall 2-1 thanks to Karlan Ahearne-Grant\u2019s 12th goal this term just six minutes in and Lyle Taylor\u2019s ninth-minute penalty, while Andy Cook reduced the deficit two minutes into the second half. Plymouth moved off the bottom thanks to a 3-0 win over Oxford with Antoni Sarcevic on target after nine minutes before Ruben Lameiras added a brace. Sam Mantom and Taylor Moore scored as 10-man Southend claimed a 2-0 victory over Gillingham after losing Theo Robinson to a second yellow card late on. Coventry moved up a spot to eighth after a 2-0 win at Wycombe following Conor Chaplin\u2019s opening penalty and an effort from Jonson Clarke-Harris. Bristol Rovers and Burton played out a 0-0 draw while Shrewsbury\u2019s clash at home to Fleetwood was also goalless. Aitor Karanka talks to Sky, after his Nottingham Forest side beat Leeds 4-2: It was difficult to explain because when they equalised, when they came back, I thought it was going to be difficult but the energy, the power was amazing and in the same way we did against Villa, today at home has been amazing for me, the players and the crowd. They deserved a performance like today. Before this game there were several reports that he would be sacked if he failed to win this game. He is asked about those reports, and whether he would appreciate it if the board were to make a public statement backing him: I don\u2019t care about anything. I care about my job and my players. Here\u2019s Amy Lawrence\u2019s match report from the Emirates Stadium on Arsenal 4-1 Fulham: Having wobbled and tumbled over a challenging Christmas week, Arsenal got back on the bike. They did so a little gingerly, but ended an afternoon spent sparring with Fulham buoyed by the restorative power of points and goals. Much more here: The former Liverpool winger Peter Thompson died yesterday, aged 76. Here\u2019s his obituary: The final whistle goes at Villa Park, where Aston Villa have drawn 2-2 with QPR, and that is the final 3pm kick-off to finish. Nick Miller is dealing with Cardiff v Tottenham \u2013 join him here if you like. Or stay with me while I cover the fall-out of a dramatic day of thrilling action, or at least a bit of it. It\u2019s all over at the City Ground, where Nottingham Forest have beaten Leeds 4-2. And it\u2019s all over at Brentford, where Norwich have been held to a draw. Leeds\u2019 lead at the top of the Championship is thus trimmed to two points, but with West Brom losing at Blackburn yet again none of the top three (as was) has won. In League Two the leaders, Lincoln City, were 1-0 up at home to Port Vale in stoppage time, whereupon Manny Oyeleke scored what sounds like a superb equaliser. Ipswich\u2019s comeback didn\u2019t quite come back far enough: it\u2019s finished 2-3 there with Millwall holding on to victory. It\u2019s always a happy new year at Arsenal: Into stoppage time at Brentford, and there will be five minutes of it! Plenty of time for a winner there! No lack of action here. Five goals and there probably should have been twice as many, but it was comfortable for Arsenal in the end. It\u2019s all over at Hull, where Bolton\u2019s torture is finally over and Hull have won 6-0. A team that one once in 11 matches in all competitions between August and September, and was 23rd in the table in November, has now won six of their last seven and drawn the other! Ipswich could still salvage something from their game against \u2013 it\u2019s now 2-3, Kayden Jackson scoring from roughly 23 yards! Norwich have equalised at Brentford! It\u2019s a corner on the left, which drops inside a crowded area and is poked in by, um, someone. It\u2019s given to Timm Klose, and the Canaries have six minutes (plus stoppages) to find their traditional dramatic late winner. It was almost 4-3 at the City Ground, where Robinson has just headed against his own post, but the ball went the right side of it from his point of view. Also 6-0 up now are MK Dons, who were three up against Cambridge after 12 minutes and have taken a disappointing 73 minutes over their second trio. It\u2019s Hull 6-0 Bolton now, a free-kick on the right bouncing through to the far post, where it\u2019s headed back across goal and Nouha Dicko heads in from four yards! A left-wing corner is headed clear, but at the edge of the area it all gets a bit messy. A fulham player heads it back in the wrong direction, it pings off a few legs and falls to Sokratis, who plays Aubameyang in on the right of the area, and his shot hits a defender\u2019s shin and loops into the net! It\u2019s Nottingham Forest 4-2 Leeds! And surely it\u2019s all over now! Murphy, on the halfway line, is played down the left, he passes infield to Ben Osborn and he does just fantastically to take it past Forshaw with a fabulous first touch with his left foot, before sending a right-foot shot across goal and into the top corner! The intrigue at Arsenal is that Ramsey had come on just a couple of minutes before that goal, replacing Lacazette. When the board went up and Lacazette\u2019s name was read out, the crowd produced a chorus of furious booing. Preston have pulled a goal back at Rotherham, Lukas Nmecha making it 2-1. Kolasinac crosses low from the left, Aubameyang meets it but his shot hits the post, rebounds out to Ramsey, and he controls and fires in! Ipswich are now 3-1 down at home to Ipswich, and Rotherham 2-0 up at home to Preston. It\u2019s Nottingham Forest 3-2 Leeds United! A corner from the left is headed down by Murphy at the far post, and it bounces just beyond the goalkeeper\u2019s reach and squeezes inside the post! Reading have scored a goal! Callum Harriott makes it Reading 1-4 against Swansea. It\u2019s Hull 5-0 Bolton now. Jarrod Bowen takes the ball at the edge of the area, controls it with his right foot, and scores with his left. Enough now. Stop. Have some pity. Nottingham Forest equalise! It\u2019s a corner from the left, headed into the air at the near post by a Leeds player, headed down at the far post by a Forest player, and it drops to Colback, 15 yards from goal, who lashes it in first-time! Plymouth are now 3-0 up at home to Oxford, and Ruben Lameiras has scored his second goal of the day! Ten-man Leeds have taken the lead! The ball is chipped into the area from the right, volleyed back across goal from beyond the far post, and Ezgjan Alioski smashes in a close-range volley! It\u2019s Nottingham Forest 1-2 Leeds! Now they have scored! It\u2019s a fine build-up that ends with the ball driven low across the area and Kamara, just on as a sub, scoring at the far post! Fulham should have scored! Again! This time Mitrovic meets a cross from the right and, six yards from goal, heads low but straight at the keeper! Hull are 4-0 up against Bolton. There are backheels in the build-up and everything, carnival football to see in the new year. Chris Martin caps a smart exchange of passes with a goal. Oooh! Roofe comes close to giving 10-man Leeds the lead at Nottingham Forest, running onto a long pass, controlling brilliantly as Pantilimon runs out, and then lifting over the keeper but wide of goal! Hull have made it 3-0 now, Kamil Grosicki scoring his second goal of the afternoon with a low drive. Another penalty, this at Blackburn where Jay Rodriguez has scored from the spot to bring West Brom back into the match at 2-1. Hull are surely on their way to a fifth successive victory, Evandro putting them 2-0 up at home to Bolton. In further equalising news, Millwall have made it 1-1 at Ipswich, Shane Ferguson sending the goalkeeper the wrong way from the spot. Middlesbrough have equalised at Derby, and QPR have gone 2-1 up at Aston Villa, Eberechi Eze finishing excellently when found just inside the area by a pull-back from the right! Ten-man Leeds equalise at Nottingham Forest! Jack Clarke scores it, beating Pantilimon with a smart low shot at the near post. The goalkeeper should probably have stopped that, but he took so long going down to save it I think he\u2019s still in motion. Billy Sharp\u2019s goal for Sheffield United was his 220th in the league, making him the top scorer in England\u2019s top four divisions this century. Arsenal extend their lead, again after a left-wing throw-in. Aubameyang feeds Kolasinac, who pulls back to Lacazette, on his own on the penalty spot, who controls and then lashes in! That means Sheffield United, as things stand, will go third in the Championship table, and they celebrate with a third goal, Billy Sharp scoring with ludicrous ease from a low centre from the right! Blackburn take the lead against third-place West Brom, Charlie Mulgrew\u2019s corner from the right wing curling straight in at the far post! Good news for one Sheffield side but bad news for the other, Che Adams equalising for Birmingham at Sheffield Wednesday. It\u2019s a classic route one strike, a long ball flicked on to Adams, who finishes very well. Sheffield United go 2-0 up at Wigan, Mark Duffy snaffling their second, and the Blades could go third today. Oly McBurnie has put Swansea 4-0 up at Reading, blasting home a penalty after Routledge is fouled in the box. At the Emirates, Fulham get the second half started. Plymouth are 2-0 up at home to Oxford, Ruben Lameiras scoring a second in the 41st minute (long enough ago for me to have already told you about it, really, but better late than never). It should really be 2-2, perhaps 2-3, but Granit Xhaka is the only person to stick the ball in the onion bag and thus Arsenal take a slender lead into the break. Rotherham are beating Preston 1-0, Will Vaulks smashing in a fabulous blunderbuss free-kick in first-half stoppage time. Mike van der Hoorn puts Swansea 3-0 up at Reading, ghosting in unmarked at the far post to turn in a left-wing free-kick. Leeds go down to 10 men at Nottingham Forest! Kalvin Phillips dives in two-footed in a bid to win the ball off/break the legs of Adl\u00e8ne Gu\u00e9dioura, and the referee barely hesitates before raising the red card! Cowabunga! Luke Freeman has equalised for QPR against Aston Villa, lashing an unstoppable shot into the net from 25 yards! Bristol City have scored at Stoke! Famara Diedhiou with it, heading in smartly from a right-wing cross. Definitely kit-assisted, obviously. Xhaka misses the chance to score a second! From a throw-in Arsenal work the ball into the left side of the area, it\u2019s pulled back by Kolasinac to Xhaka, level with the near post and perhaps seven hards out, but his shot is saved by Sergio Rico, who came out quickly to make the Arsenal man\u2019s life difficult. Fulham go close again! A cross from the right goes deflects into the air and just past Mitrovic, but it\u2019s then crossed again from the left and this time Mitrovic heads it towards goal, but Leno saves! Leeds go close at Forest! It\u2019s a corner on the right, flicked on at the near post and it flies across goal, just past the toe of Roofe at the far post, and wide! The defender on the far post threw out a leg and got a very slight touch on the ball as it went through, and that\u2019s what stopped Roofe from converting. Talking of struggling teams, Swansea have gone 2-0 up at Reading. It\u2019s extremely messy, Connor Roberts eventually turning home after a bit of ping-pong. Hull are winning again! Kamil Grosicki has given them the lead at home to struggling Bolton. It\u2019s a low cross from the right, and Grosicki hits it into a defender, collects the rebound, and this time lashes it into the roof of the net! That was a fine late run into the box from Xhaka, one that no Fulham player seemed inclined to track, but coming not 90 seconds after Sessegnon\u2019s miss that\u2019s got to smart. Instead it\u2019s Arsenal who steal the lead! Granit Xhaka, also completely unmarked, turns in Iwobi\u2019s cross from the left! Unbelievable miss! Fulham really should be in the lead now, after Schurrle plays the ball into the box and Sessegnon runs onto it at the far post, entirely free of any kind of marking. It\u2019s a straightforward tap-in, but somehow he misses it completely! The Championship leaders are losing, and so are the side in second! Brentford take a 1-0 lead over Norwich after a corner is headed in by Julian Jeanvier! Aston Villa take the lead against QPR! It\u2019s Tammy Abraham\u2019s 15th of the season, taking him level with Neal Maupay, Teemu Pukki and Billy Sharp at the top of the Championship scoring charts! He could hardly miss, after McGinn\u2019s chipped cross dropped onto his head five yards out. Sheffield Wednesday have taken the lead against Birmingham! It\u2019s a bit scrappy, but a tidy finish from Steven Fletcher, spinning and hooking the ball past the keeper after Bannan\u2019s free-kick was headed down by Lees. Sessegnon has had the best chance of the game so far at Arsenal, but curled his shot just wide. It remains 0-0 there. Twelve minutes played in Milton Keynes, and MK Dons are already 3-0 up against Cambridge United. Chuks Aneke has scored the third. A big goal at the bottom of League One, where Plymouth have taken the lead at home to Oxford, Antoni Sarcevic scoring in the ninth minute. Bristol City are 11th in the league but seventh (level on points with Derby, but one behind on goal difference) away from home. This is surely kit-related. I\u2019ll put an action shot in here in due course, but here are the kits laid out in the dressing-room pre-match, though you miss the impact of the green shorts. Stoke have won and failed to convert a penalty, Afobe shooting low to his right but the goalkeeper going the right way and saving really quite easily. Bristol City\u2019s away kit really is quite shocking, and I\u2019m not surprised that some opponents find themselves discombobulated. Leeds have fallen behind to Nottingham Forest! Jack Colback has got the goal, latching on to a hopelessly underpowered back-pass, rounding the goalkeeper and smacking the ball home! At Arsenal, Aubameyang scoops over from close range. It was a sharp chance, under pressure at the near post as he met Iwobi\u2019s low cross, and he couldn\u2019t quite divert the ball goalwards. Still in the Championship, Jack Lancaster has curled a left-footed shot across goal and in at the far post to put Ipswich ahead against Millwall! Oli McBurnie has given Swansea an early lead at Reading, heading in a right-wing cross. We\u2019ve already had a goal! Wilson has put Derby ahead at home to Middlesbrough, lashing a left-footed shot in at the near post in the second minute! At the Emirates, there will be a minute\u2019s silence before kick-off in memory of Peter Hill-Wood, Arsenal\u2019s former chairman, who died last week. Here\u2019s Andy Hunter\u2019s match report from Goodison Park: And here\u2019s some more music. Kick-off in 15 minutes! Our big transfer window interactive is online now, and will be updated throughout the month. Already three deals worth \u00a323m have been added today: It\u2019s all over at Goodison Park, and Leicester have gone and won another one! The Foxes go seventh, though Wolves and potentially also Watford could overtake them over the next couple of days. The early Premier League kick-off is very close to a conclusion, with Leicester leading 1-0 at Goodison Park. Meanwhile, here\u2019s some more music: Here are the line-ups from the one top flight 3pm kick-off, at the Emirates Stadium: Arsenal: Leno, Papastathopoulos, Koscielny, Mustafi, Maitland-Niles, Guendouzi, Xhaka, Kolasinac, Iwobi, Aubameyang, Lacazette. Subs: Cech, Elneny, Ramsey, Torreira, Lichtsteiner, Nketiah, Saka. Fulham: Sergio Rico, Odoi, Le Marchand, Ream, Christie, Cairney, Cisse, Bryan, Schurrle, Mitrovic, Ryan Sessegnon. Subs: Bettinelli, Johansen, Ayite, Vietto, Fosu-Mensah, Seri, Kamara. Referee: Graham Scott. It being the first day of a new year, I might throw in a few of my favourite pieces of music from the last 12 months while we wait for kick-off. This might be No1, released in the first few days of last year and just magnificent from first to last. Team news should be dropping in the next few minutes. Given the constraints enforced by time, space and logic I can\u2019t put up all the EFL line-ups, but do let me know if there are any you\u2019re particularly keen to see. Welcome to the year\u2019s very first clockwatch! Let\u2019s crack on with it, then: today\u2019s Football League fixtures (3pm kick-offs unless stated): Premier League We\u2019ve only got one top-flight game to think about this afternoon, so let\u2019s hope it\u2019s a good one. Arsenal v Fulham Cardiff v Tottenham Hotspur (5.30pm) Everton v Leicester (12.30pm) Championship The top three all slipped up on Saturday, and all are away today, against the teams 17th, 18th and 20th in the last-six-game form table \u2013 though Blackburn, who host West Brom, have done reasonably well at home of late, losing only one of their last six (to Norwich just before Christmas), a run that started with victory over Leeds back in October. Hull, unbeaten in seven and on a run of four consecutive victories, have a good chance of extending that run at home to a Bolton side that has won once in 15 games. Above is a picture of Nottingham Forest\u2019s City Ground this afternoon \u2013 the pasture looks a little ragged down near that corner flag. Aston Villa v QPR Blackburn v West Brom Brentford v Norwich Derby v Middlesbrough Hull v Bolton Ipswich v Millwall Nottm Forest v Leeds Reading v Swansea Rotherham v Preston North End Sheff Wed v Birmingham Stoke v Bristol City Wigan v Sheff Utd League One Portsmouth extended their lead at the top on Saturday with a rambunctious 5-2 win at Fleetwood while Luton could only draw at Walsall, and today are at home to Wimbledon. Their home record is not that great \u2013 four teams have won more points than them \u2013 but the 23rd-placed Dons might not be the team to test it. Luton, unbeaten at home this season with 10 wins in 12, host fourth-placed Barnsley. Bottom-placed Plymouth could do with three points against Oxford, who are five points ahead in 20th. Above is a new year-themed picture from Peterborough, who play Scunthorpe this afternoon. Blackpool v Sunderland Bradford v Accrington Stanley Bristol Rovers v Burton Albion Charlton v Walsall Doncaster v Rochdale Luton v Barnsley Peterborough v Scunthorpe Plymouth v Oxford Utd Portsmouth v AFC Wimbledon Shrewsbury v Fleetwood Town Southend v Gillingham Wycombe v Coventry League Two Other than Grimsby\u2019s game against Mansfield \u2013 the top two teams in the division on form \u2013 which having kicked off early will be over by 3pm, today\u2019s League Two fixtures are largely devoid of spice, with none of the promotion-chasing teams playing rivals while towards the bottom the best you\u2019ll get is Yeovil v Cheltenham, 21st v 19th. Yeovil are four points ahead of the bottom two, with the best goal difference in the bottom half of the table (thanks largely to 4-0 and 6-0 away wins over Notts and Newport Counties, the most recent of which happened nearly four months ago). Above is a picture taken this afternoon of the New Lawn, where Forest Green play Northampton today. Bury v Crewe Crawley Town v Colchester Forest Green v Northampton Grimsby v Mansfield (1pm) Lincoln City v Port Vale Macclesfield v Tranmere Milton Keynes Dons v Cambridge Utd Morecambe v Carlisle Oldham v Notts County Stevenage v Newport County Swindon v Exeter Yeovil v Cheltenham",

The golden generation are now silver foxes leaving behind a cohort lacking celebrity.

Goalkeeper Mat Ryan is arguably the Australian performing at the highest level week in week out, while the captain is an unfashionable defensive utility. Football Federation Australia\u2019s marketing department is not overwhelmed with unifying assets.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s the Asian issue. Australia enjoys a relationship with the continent that could still politely be described as arm\u2019s length, and this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/may/19/asian-benefits-yet-to-transpire-as-australian-football-struggles-to-cash-in\">includes in football</a>, where opportunities for integration are abundant.

The English pundit provoked outrage by describing the Asian Cup as \u201cMickey Mouse football\u201d, using as illustration Australia\u2019s presumed ability to \u201cpump Jordan\u201d without Tom Rogic, their most creative attacker.</p> <p>Irate responses channeled the indignation that came from the Socceroos being patronisingly viewed below the Old Firm in football\u2019s global pecking order. A more satisfying riposte would have been to assert the stature of the Asian Cup, the growing quality of Asian football, and stressing the capabilities of Jordan; their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSrcEMDOqIU\">victory over Denmark</a> last year perhaps, or their ability to emerge from Rijeka as recently as October with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obM1mXvKjFA\">only a 2-1 reverse</a> at the hands of World Cup finalists Croatia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/14/mathew-leckie-anything-can-happen-at-the-asian-cup\">Mathew Leckie: 'Anything can happen at the Asian Cup' | Robert Kidd</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Sutton\u2019s offhand dismissal of Australia\u2019s confederation rivals fits the stereotype here as much as it does in the UK. To many, Australia\u2019s Asian Cup opponents - especially during the group phase - are unfamiliar, unheralded and consequently overlooked as a competitive threat.</p> <p>The yearning for glamour from Europe and South America shows no sign of abating, creating an appetite destined never to be sated. Instead, the long-term project must be to shine brighter lights on the likes of Jordan, Syria and Palestine, to generate comparable levels of interest and excitement in rivalries that will recur each World Cup and Asian Cup cycle. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/05/socceroos-sweat-on-world-cup-hopes-after-scraping-win-over-thailand\">Thailand surprised the Socceroos</a> home and away during World Cup qualifying there was a sense of bemusement at the level of performance. We should be thrilled at the rising standards and what that means for the competitiveness of the region; our region.</p> <p>All of which makes Arnold\u2019s task this month in the UAE unenviable and difficult. As coach of the defending champions he has to welcome <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/feb/02/asian-cup-socceroos-joe-gorman-analysis\">the burden of favouritism </a>despite a depleted transitional squad.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any sport that unites the nation quite like the Socceroos,\u201d enthuses Graham Arnold on a skillfully compiled hype reel for Fox Sports\u2019 coverage of the Asian Cup. It\u2019s a bullish statement but one that may struggle to find justification over the next few weeks as Australia\u2019s men\u2019s national football team competes in its biggest event outside the World Cup. Logistics are far from conducive to unifying the country. 10pm AEDT is the most family friendly kick-off time during the tournament with matches at the business end of proceedings taking place in the witching hours. Add to that, all the action from the United Arab Emirates is exclusively on pay TV. An absence of star power remains a hindrance to the Socceroos infiltrating the mainstream. The golden generation are now silver foxes leaving behind a cohort lacking celebrity. Much was made of Tim Cahill\u2019s ubiquity in pre-World Cup commercial activity but even he is no longer around to lend his familiar face. This will be the first open-age tournament without Cahill since the 2002 OFC Nations Cup. Untimely injuries to the likes of Daniel Arzani and Aaron Mooy have compounded this challenge, as has the ongoing struggle to find a first-choice striker the country can identify as a synonym for goals, the sport\u2019s most recognisable commodity. Goalkeeper Mat Ryan is arguably the Australian performing at the highest level week in week out, while the captain is an unfashionable defensive utility. Football Federation Australia\u2019s marketing department is not overwhelmed with unifying assets. And then there\u2019s the Asian issue. Australia enjoys a relationship with the continent that could still politely be described as arm\u2019s length, and this includes in football, where opportunities for integration are abundant. Asian players remain a rarity in the A-League, the Asian Champions League is neglected, and the demand for information about neighbouring leagues is far from overwhelming, despite Australia being well-served by a growing number of knowledgeable voices on the topic. An example of the peculiarities of Australia\u2019s place in Asian football arrived recently when Chris Sutton slipped into troll mode. The English pundit provoked outrage by describing the Asian Cup as \u201cMickey Mouse football\u201d, using as illustration Australia\u2019s presumed ability to \u201cpump Jordan\u201d without Tom Rogic, their most creative attacker. Irate responses channeled the indignation that came from the Socceroos being patronisingly viewed below the Old Firm in football\u2019s global pecking order. A more satisfying riposte would have been to assert the stature of the Asian Cup, the growing quality of Asian football, and stressing the capabilities of Jordan; their victory over Denmark last year perhaps, or their ability to emerge from Rijeka as recently as October with only a 2-1 reverse at the hands of World Cup finalists Croatia. But Sutton\u2019s offhand dismissal of Australia\u2019s confederation rivals fits the stereotype here as much as it does in the UK. To many, Australia\u2019s Asian Cup opponents - especially during the group phase - are unfamiliar, unheralded and consequently overlooked as a competitive threat. The yearning for glamour from Europe and South America shows no sign of abating, creating an appetite destined never to be sated. Instead, the long-term project must be to shine brighter lights on the likes of Jordan, Syria and Palestine, to generate comparable levels of interest and excitement in rivalries that will recur each World Cup and Asian Cup cycle. When Thailand surprised the Socceroos home and away during World Cup qualifying there was a sense of bemusement at the level of performance. We should be thrilled at the rising standards and what that means for the competitiveness of the region; our region. All of which makes Arnold\u2019s task this month in the UAE unenviable and difficult. As coach of the defending champions he has to welcome the burden of favouritism despite a depleted transitional squad. He has to convince skeptics the group phase, let alone the knockouts, will be no cakewalk, despite the expected procession. The afterglow of winning the whole kit and kaboodle soon wore off for his predecessor and sympathy will be in short supply if those achievements are not repeated. The odds are stacked against him.",

      "body": "<p>Making predictions in the world of business and economics is a fool\u2019s errand but that\u2019s no reason not to have a crack at it. Here are some things to look out for in 2019, which could be a rollercoaster ride.</p> \n<h2><strong>Global gloom and doom</strong></h2> \n<p>How about global recession, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/21/australian-stock-market-two-year-low-tech-energy-wall-street-ftse-dollar-us-uk\">US-China trade war</a> and a chaotic Brexit for starters? Any or all of these could cast a shadow over people and businesses the world over.</p> \n<p>The greatest unknown for British business and the economy lies in the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/31/carmakers-not-ready-for-brexit-says-smmt-as-uk-sales-fall\">automotive industry has warned</a> that production lines could be halted and investment choked off, while Airbus said it would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/22/airbus-plans-uk-cuts-amid-fears-of-hard-brexit-impact\">forced to cut jobs</a> and pull billions of pounds in UK spending. Between them, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/28/uk-car-industry-airbus-back-pm-brexit-deal-eu\">carmakers and the European aerospace giant</a> support around 1m jobs. That\u2019s before one begins to assess the impact on industries such as pharmaceuticals, aviation, food and drink or London\u2019s financial sector.</p> \n<p>Then there\u2019s the prospect that the early skirmishes of a Sino-US trade war <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/18/the-guardian-view-on-us-china-trade-wars-careful-what-you-start\">turn into full-blown hostility</a>. There\u2019s no telling what Donald Trump will do or say next so any optimism that the spectre of mutually assured destruction will bring everyone back from the brink seems naive.</p> \n<p>Trade wars, coupled with higher interest rates in major economies such as the US, could place greater drag on a global economy that already seems to be cooling, particularly in Europe and Asia. However, respected economist Nouriel Roubini has said a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/13/recession-2020-financial-crisis-nouriel-roubini\">crash won\u2019t come until 2020</a>. You\u2019ve got to take your crumbs of comfort where you can.</p> \n<h2><strong>The next Carillion?</strong></h2> \n<p>Ever since the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/16/recklessness-hubris-and-greed-carillion-slammed-by-mps\"> outsourcing and construction firm\u2019s ignominious collapse</a> a year ago, pundits and short-sellers have been placing bets on who will be next. The two companies mentioned most often in the same breath as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/carillion\">Carillion</a> are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/20/kier-investors-shun-efforts-to-raise-264m-in-funds\">Kier</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/10/interserve-shares-rescue-plan-carillion\">Interserve</a>. Both insist they have taken pre-emptive steps to avoid a similar fate. But there were some concerning words in Kier\u2019s explanation for having to go cap in hand to shareholders for \u00a3250m. It warned that banks were pulling back from lending to the construction industry \u2013 words that will have sent shivers down the spine of anyone who remembers the last financial crisis.</p> \n<h2><strong>Fracking hell</strong></h2> \n<p>Cuadrilla became the first company to frack for gas since 2011 this year, drilling near Blackpool, Lancashire. Rivals are set to follow suit, with iGas probably the most likely to get fracking in 2019 and petrochemicals giant Ineos also champing at the bit. If Cuadrilla\u2019s experience is anything to go by though, this could mean <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/11/fracking-blackpool-tremor-cuadrilla\">minor earthquakes</a> in and around the areas where hydraulic fracturing \u2013 to give it its full name \u2013 takes place. If tremors become commonplace, 2019 could well be the year in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fracking\">fracking</a> becomes politically unpalatable in the UK for the foreseeable future.</p> \n<h2><strong>Ryanair revolution</strong></h2> \n<p>Ever since Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/30/ryanair-deal-uk-pilots-union-balps\">agreed to recognise trade unions</a>, he\u2019s been at war with them. The year 2018 involved<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/07/ryanair-strikes-their-brand-is-built-on-being-reliable-bastards\"> disruptive strike action by pilots and cabin crew</a>, leading to flight cancellations. Ryanair has made some concessions on pay and conditions but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/24/michael-o-leary-profile-ryanair-boss-controversy\">O\u2019Leary isn\u2019t the sort of man</a> to let anyone else have the last word, branding his pilots \u201ca bunch of layabouts\u201d in December. How long can labour relations remain this poor before something has to give? Could 2019 be the year that O\u2019Leary steps down?</p> \n<h2><strong>High street, low sales</strong></h2> \n<p>It\u2019s hard to imagine how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/09/embattled-high-street-retailers-call-for-help-as-closures-soar\">conditions on the high street</a> could get much worse. Failures in 2018 included Maplin\u2019s, Toys R Us, House of Fraser and Poundworld. Now Debenhams is in a difficult position. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8113512b-8ee0-49dc-80d3-0b56df87e441\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What\u2019s the problem?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Physical retailers have been hit by a combination of changing habits, rising costs and broader economic problems as well as the coronavirus pandemic. In the past few years names such as Mothercare, Karen Millen, Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have disappeared from the UK high street as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. Companies such as Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \"stuff\" as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Uncertainty about the economy has also slowed the housing market and linked makeovers of homes. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit and the coronavirus, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high street presence want the government to change business rates to even up the tax burden with online players and to adapt more quickly to the rapidly changing market. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges, which they say put off shoppers. Many businesses which deal with complex supply chains also want additional help with the new red tape and import charges imposed after Boris Johnson's Brexit deal saddled them with extra costs.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the December 2019 Queen's speech, the government announced plans for further reform of business rates including more frequent revaluations and increasing the discount for small retailers, pubs, cinemas and music venues to 50% from one-third. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \"future high streets fund\" under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Brexit contingency plans, including stockpiling of goods, are already costing retailers money. Consumers are reining in spending. Weakness in the housing market means homewares may continue to suffer, while fashion sales remain in the doldrums. The government has offered little sign of relief on punishing business rates, while the threat posed to traditional stores by lightly taxed online giants is unlikely to abate.</p> \n<h2><strong>Reefer madness</strong></h2> \n<p>Predictions for 2019 have offered precious few reasons to giggle uncontrollably so far but here\u2019s one. The liberalisation of cannabis laws in North America presents <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/03/cannabis-industry-legalization-who-is-making-money\">huge opportunities for big business</a>. Marlboro cigarette company Altria has agreed to invest $1.9bn in cannabis firm Cronos, while Budweiser owner AB InBev is working with Canadian pot firm Tilray on a $100m research deal into non-alcoholic drinks containing the active ingredients of cannabis, THC and CBD. </p> \n<p>However, you look at it, 2018 has been a high point (apologies) for the cannabis industry. Marijuana smokers are legion and the US market is gigantic. Expect interest and investment to surge in 2019.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Bank battles</strong></h2> \n<p>Legal battles lie ahead for former Barclays\u2019 executives and Lloyds, raising the mouth-watering prospect of finding out which is the tougher opponent for the might of the financial sector, the Serious Fraud Office or television presenter Noel Edmonds.</p> \n<p>The SFO is set to begin its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/20/barclays-four-charged-bankers-sfo-john-varley\">case against bankers</a> including former Barclays chief executive John Varley over the bank\u2019s fundraising deals in the Middle East at the height of the credit crunch.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/19/noel-edmonds-likely-to-file-60m-lloyds-lawsuit-on-wednesday\">Edmonds\u2019 \u00a360m suit</a> against Lloyds for alleged fraud at HBOS is set to continue, with the TV star preparing to file his legal claim. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Making predictions in the world of business and economics is a fool\u2019s errand but that\u2019s no reason not to have a crack at it. Here are some things to look out for in 2019, which could be a rollercoaster ride. Global gloom and doom How about global recession, a US-China trade war and a chaotic Brexit for starters? Any or all of these could cast a shadow over people and businesses the world over. The greatest unknown for British business and the economy lies in the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. The automotive industry has warned that production lines could be halted and investment choked off, while Airbus said it would be forced to cut jobs and pull billions of pounds in UK spending. Between them, carmakers and the European aerospace giant support around 1m jobs. That\u2019s before one begins to assess the impact on industries such as pharmaceuticals, aviation, food and drink or London\u2019s financial sector. Then there\u2019s the prospect that the early skirmishes of a Sino-US trade war turn into full-blown hostility. There\u2019s no telling what Donald Trump will do or say next so any optimism that the spectre of mutually assured destruction will bring everyone back from the brink seems naive. Trade wars, coupled with higher interest rates in major economies such as the US, could place greater drag on a global economy that already seems to be cooling, particularly in Europe and Asia. However, respected economist Nouriel Roubini has said a crash won\u2019t come until 2020. You\u2019ve got to take your crumbs of comfort where you can. The next Carillion? Ever since the outsourcing and construction firm\u2019s ignominious collapse a year ago, pundits and short-sellers have been placing bets on who will be next. The two companies mentioned most often in the same breath as Carillion are Kier and Interserve. Both insist they have taken pre-emptive steps to avoid a similar fate. But there were some concerning words in Kier\u2019s explanation for having to go cap in hand to shareholders for \u00a3250m. It warned that banks were pulling back from lending to the construction industry \u2013 words that will have sent shivers down the spine of anyone who remembers the last financial crisis. Fracking hell Cuadrilla became the first company to frack for gas since 2011 this year, drilling near Blackpool, Lancashire. Rivals are set to follow suit, with iGas probably the most likely to get fracking in 2019 and petrochemicals giant Ineos also champing at the bit. If Cuadrilla\u2019s experience is anything to go by though, this could mean minor earthquakes in and around the areas where hydraulic fracturing \u2013 to give it its full name \u2013 takes place. If tremors become commonplace, 2019 could well be the year in which fracking becomes politically unpalatable in the UK for the foreseeable future. Ryanair revolution Ever since Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary agreed to recognise trade unions, he\u2019s been at war with them. The year 2018 involved disruptive strike action by pilots and cabin crew, leading to flight cancellations. Ryanair has made some concessions on pay and conditions but O\u2019Leary isn\u2019t the sort of man to let anyone else have the last word, branding his pilots \u201ca bunch of layabouts\u201d in December. How long can labour relations remain this poor before something has to give? Could 2019 be the year that O\u2019Leary steps down? High street, low sales It\u2019s hard to imagine how conditions on the high street could get much worse. Failures in 2018 included Maplin\u2019s, Toys R Us, House of Fraser and Poundworld. Now Debenhams is in a difficult position. Brexit contingency plans, including stockpiling of goods, are already costing retailers money. Consumers are reining in spending. Weakness in the housing market means homewares may continue to suffer, while fashion sales remain in the doldrums. The government has offered little sign of relief on punishing business rates, while the threat posed to traditional stores by lightly taxed online giants is unlikely to abate. Reefer madness Predictions for 2019 have offered precious few reasons to giggle uncontrollably so far but here\u2019s one. The liberalisation of cannabis laws in North America presents huge opportunities for big business. Marlboro cigarette company Altria has agreed to invest $1.9bn in cannabis firm Cronos, while Budweiser owner AB InBev is working with Canadian pot firm Tilray on a $100m research deal into non-alcoholic drinks containing the active ingredients of cannabis, THC and CBD. However, you look at it, 2018 has been a high point (apologies) for the cannabis industry. Marijuana smokers are legion and the US market is gigantic. Expect interest and investment to surge in 2019. Bank battles Legal battles lie ahead for former Barclays\u2019 executives and Lloyds, raising the mouth-watering prospect of finding out which is the tougher opponent for the might of the financial sector, the Serious Fraud Office or television presenter Noel Edmonds. The SFO is set to begin its case against bankers including former Barclays chief executive John Varley over the bank\u2019s fundraising deals in the Middle East at the height of the credit crunch. Meanwhile, Edmonds\u2019 \u00a360m suit against Lloyds for alleged fraud at HBOS is set to continue, with the TV star preparing to file his legal claim.",

Both the opposition and ruling coalition have claimed victory in the elections \u2013 the third poll since 2002 and the end of a civil war in which millions died. The election, which some observers hope may bring a measure of political stability to the vast central African country, was marred by widespread logistics problems, insecurity and an outbreak of Ebola. Millions were left unable to vote. Barnab\u00e9 Kikaya Bin Karubi, a senior adviser to the outgoing president, Joseph Kabila, said internet and SMS services were cut on Monday to preserve public order after \u201cfictitious results\u201d began circulating on social media. \u201cThat could lead us straight toward chaos,\u201d Kikaya told Reuters, adding that the connections would remain cut until the publication of preliminary results on 6 January.

The election, which passed off mostly peacefully, could bring about the central African country\u2019s first ostensibly democratic transition of power in its troubled history and chart a road to a better future. Others fear renewed instability if the opposition rejects the results and calls for protests. Already delayed by two years, the poll was postponed by a further week to allow more time to overcome logistical challenges in a country of 80 million inhabitants spread over an area the size of western Europe with almost no metalled roads. Kabila\u2019s second electoral mandate expired in 2016 and he only reluctantly called new elections under pressure from regional powers.

      "body": "<p>Imagine a shopper in an electronics store. Look, there\u2019s a Fitbit display, with its \u201cactivity bands\u201d which measure your steps and show details. Or, more pricey, its Versa smartwatch. Perhaps to save money, just buy the activity band? But wait \u2026 just over there are some generic activity bands, and they\u2019re cheaper. Maybe save some money with those.</p> <p>Move along a bit, and there are GoPro cameras. But once again, there are some slightly cheaper models beside them; not well-known brands, but a camera is a camera, surely? Further along, there\u2019s a Parrot drone. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/06/how-smart-speakers-stole-the-show-from-smartphones\">Next to those is a Sonos speaker, which works with Amazon\u2019s Alexa</a>. But beside it is a cheaper Amazon Echo, and a voice-controlled Google Home, and a Siri-enabled Apple HomePod. Why would you go with the smaller brand, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/nov/24/amazon-echo-or-google-home-smart-speaker\">faced with those offerings from tech\u2019s behemoths?</a> Or, at the previous displays, why not just buy the cheaper models?</p> <p>That\u2019s the challenge for many consumer electronics firms. Not how to make things, or how to distribute them and get them in front of potential buyers. It\u2019s how to make a profit. Out of Fitbit, GoPro, Parrot and Sonos \u2013 each operating in different parts of the consumer electronics business \u2013 only Sonos made an operating profit in the last financial quarter, and all four have made a cumulative operating loss so far this year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/09/the-20-best-gadgets-of-2018\">The 20 best gadgets of 2018</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Making a profit in hardware has always been difficult. By contrast, in software, all the significant costs are in development; reproduction and distribution are trivial \u2013 a digital copy is perfect, and the internet will transport 0s and 1s anywhere, effectively for free. If your product is free and ad-supported, you don\u2019t even need anti-piracy measures; you want people to copy it and use it. Software companies typically have gross margins of around 80%, and operating profits of 40% or so.</p> <p>In hardware, though, the world now seems full of companies living by the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u2019s mantra that \u201cyour [profit] margin is my opportunity\u201d. Indeed, Amazon is one of the reasons why long-term profit is more elusive: it provides a means for small startups to distribute products without formal warehousing arrangements, and compete with bigger businesses at lower cost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"730aa454a8aea7d4934ab688c1afda09e6633776\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/730aa454a8aea7d4934ab688c1afda09e6633776/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shenzhen, southern China\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shenzhen, southern China - the global hub for consumer hardware manufacturers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: bingfengwu/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That, together with the rise of a gigantic electronic manufacturing capability in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, about an hour\u2019s drive north of Hong Kong, has made the modern hardware business one where only those with huge reserves of capital and brand recognition can hope to thrive. Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, and Sony can probably rely on their brand name; after that, it\u2019s survival of the fittest.</p> <p>So is it already game over for GoPro and the rest? None is a newcomer. GoPro was founded in 2002 by Nick Woodman, who wanted to capture better pictures of a surfing trip to Australia; it came to market in June 2014. Sonos was also founded in 2002, focusing on multi-room high-quality sound, and came to the market earlier in 2018. Fitbit was set up in March 2007, and joined the stock market in June 2015. Parrot is the oldest of them all, founded in 1994 and has made many consumer electronics products, including a voice-recognition system (in 1995) and a Bluetooth-based hands-free kit for cars in 2000.</p> <p>Parrot got into drones, both for consumers and business, in 2010 and early in 2018, its chief executive and co-founder, Henri Seydoux, confidently called the drone market \u201cthe emergence of a new industry with global strategic and economic stakes\u201d. By November, though, he was contemplating a 40% year-on-year crash in revenues. The shares sank to an all-time low of \u20ac1.58 (\u00a31.44) \u2013 down from \u20ac37 in 2015 \u2013 valuing Parrot at less than its cash reserves. Seydoux insists the consumer drone market is just \u201ctaking a break\u201d.</p> <p>Fitbit is struggling to move away from fitness bands \u2013 simple devices that record steps and calories burnt \u2013 where low-cost Chinese products are swamping the market. It is trying to shift into smartwatches, which are higher-priced, have more uses and generate higher customer loyalty. But it\u2019s not easy; in the first nine months of the year it sold 8.4m fitness bands \u2013 and 2.8m smartwatches. The opportunity is there: Fitbit has 25m users who pay a subscription to its services, and could be future smartwatch buyers. But in the most recent quarter it made a $200m (\u00a3157m) operating loss on sales of $940m and over the past eight quarters it has made a net loss of $624m. Its shares, which hit $47 soon after its IPO in 2015, are now $4.97.</p> <p>GoPro has managed to stabilise its unit sales, at about 1m per quarter, but profitability has remained elusive. So it is trying to encourage owners on to a subscription offering, at $5 per month; so far 185,000 have signed up, generating about $11.1m a year. That\u2019s about the same revenue as selling an extra 44,000 cameras \u2013 but the profit on subscriptions, as with software, is far higher than on the hardware. Its shares are currently at $4.24, down from $87 in 2014.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1644e9db9d6cc083bd2c346aac1aa616511086bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1644e9db9d6cc083bd2c346aac1aa616511086bc/58_0_4354_2614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A new GoPro Karma foldable drone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A new GoPro Karma foldable drone.

I might buy a GoPro, but I don\u2019t need it on a daily basis if I have a smartphone. Same with Parrot \u2013 it\u2019s a very niche segment. These companies were so eager to get to an IPO that they took advantage of the hype around their category, but haven\u2019t been able to reinvent themselves, and they need to do that to keep alive.\u201d</p> <p>The risk for such companies is that they are consigned to the virtual, or real, cupboard under the stairs to gather dust, while smartphone capability expands to take on functions that once needed a separate device.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/02/stationery-pads-gadgets-pens-trade-fair\">Yet it\u2019s never been easier to make and sell hardware. </a>Crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo provide easy ways to find early adopters who will stake money on entrepreneurs with unproven designs, which can then be realised in Shenzhen. The Pebble smartwatch raised $10.3m as a Kickstarter project in 2012, then its biggest-ever fundraising; it topped that in 2015, raising $20.3m for a newer model. Yet in December 2016 it announced it would close, citing financial trouble. (Fitbit bought its intellectual property \u2013 essentially, the smartwatch software \u2013 for $23m.) \u201cCrowdfunding sites are great for attracting early adopters, but the majority of consumers don\u2019t go there,\u201d says Jeronimo. \u201cIt misleads companies into thinking their category is going to explode.\u201d</p> <p>Even while it tried to expand beyond those early adopters, Pebble\u2019s problem (which is now also Fitbit\u2019s problem) was that Apple launched its own smartwatch in 2015, and quickly became the largest smartwatch maker. Sonos, similarly, found that a market it once had to itself \u2013 multi-room speakers streaming music and radio from the internet \u2013 turned into a jostling match with Amazon in 2014, followed by Google and most recently, Apple. Suddenly, everyone is making a \u201csmart speaker\u201d, and Sonos\u2019s hardware-only model has come into sharp focus because it doesn\u2019t have a native voice assistant (it is adding Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s \u2018OK Google\u2019).</p> <p>The ability for the big players to squash smaller players isn\u2019t unique to hardware; Facebook has tried to do it to rivals such as Snapchat.

      "bodyText": "Imagine a shopper in an electronics store. Look, there\u2019s a Fitbit display, with its \u201cactivity bands\u201d which measure your steps and show details. Or, more pricey, its Versa smartwatch. Perhaps to save money, just buy the activity band? But wait \u2026 just over there are some generic activity bands, and they\u2019re cheaper. Maybe save some money with those. Move along a bit, and there are GoPro cameras. But once again, there are some slightly cheaper models beside them; not well-known brands, but a camera is a camera, surely? Further along, there\u2019s a Parrot drone. Next to those is a Sonos speaker, which works with Amazon\u2019s Alexa. But beside it is a cheaper Amazon Echo, and a voice-controlled Google Home, and a Siri-enabled Apple HomePod. Why would you go with the smaller brand, faced with those offerings from tech\u2019s behemoths? Or, at the previous displays, why not just buy the cheaper models? That\u2019s the challenge for many consumer electronics firms. Not how to make things, or how to distribute them and get them in front of potential buyers. It\u2019s how to make a profit. Out of Fitbit, GoPro, Parrot and Sonos \u2013 each operating in different parts of the consumer electronics business \u2013 only Sonos made an operating profit in the last financial quarter, and all four have made a cumulative operating loss so far this year. Making a profit in hardware has always been difficult. By contrast, in software, all the significant costs are in development; reproduction and distribution are trivial \u2013 a digital copy is perfect, and the internet will transport 0s and 1s anywhere, effectively for free. If your product is free and ad-supported, you don\u2019t even need anti-piracy measures; you want people to copy it and use it. Software companies typically have gross margins of around 80%, and operating profits of 40% or so. In hardware, though, the world now seems full of companies living by the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u2019s mantra that \u201cyour [profit] margin is my opportunity\u201d. Indeed, Amazon is one of the reasons why long-term profit is more elusive: it provides a means for small startups to distribute products without formal warehousing arrangements, and compete with bigger businesses at lower cost. That, together with the rise of a gigantic electronic manufacturing capability in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, about an hour\u2019s drive north of Hong Kong, has made the modern hardware business one where only those with huge reserves of capital and brand recognition can hope to thrive. Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, and Sony can probably rely on their brand name; after that, it\u2019s survival of the fittest. So is it already game over for GoPro and the rest? None is a newcomer. GoPro was founded in 2002 by Nick Woodman, who wanted to capture better pictures of a surfing trip to Australia; it came to market in June 2014. Sonos was also founded in 2002, focusing on multi-room high-quality sound, and came to the market earlier in 2018. Fitbit was set up in March 2007, and joined the stock market in June 2015. Parrot is the oldest of them all, founded in 1994 and has made many consumer electronics products, including a voice-recognition system (in 1995) and a Bluetooth-based hands-free kit for cars in 2000. Parrot got into drones, both for consumers and business, in 2010 and early in 2018, its chief executive and co-founder, Henri Seydoux, confidently called the drone market \u201cthe emergence of a new industry with global strategic and economic stakes\u201d. By November, though, he was contemplating a 40% year-on-year crash in revenues. The shares sank to an all-time low of \u20ac1.58 (\u00a31.44) \u2013 down from \u20ac37 in 2015 \u2013 valuing Parrot at less than its cash reserves. Seydoux insists the consumer drone market is just \u201ctaking a break\u201d. Fitbit is struggling to move away from fitness bands \u2013 simple devices that record steps and calories burnt \u2013 where low-cost Chinese products are swamping the market. It is trying to shift into smartwatches, which are higher-priced, have more uses and generate higher customer loyalty. But it\u2019s not easy; in the first nine months of the year it sold 8.4m fitness bands \u2013 and 2.8m smartwatches. The opportunity is there: Fitbit has 25m users who pay a subscription to its services, and could be future smartwatch buyers. But in the most recent quarter it made a $200m (\u00a3157m) operating loss on sales of $940m and over the past eight quarters it has made a net loss of $624m. Its shares, which hit $47 soon after its IPO in 2015, are now $4.97. GoPro has managed to stabilise its unit sales, at about 1m per quarter, but profitability has remained elusive. So it is trying to encourage owners on to a subscription offering, at $5 per month; so far 185,000 have signed up, generating about $11.1m a year. That\u2019s about the same revenue as selling an extra 44,000 cameras \u2013 but the profit on subscriptions, as with software, is far higher than on the hardware. Its shares are currently at $4.24, down from $87 in 2014. \u201cIt\u2019s harder for any company that focuses mainly on hardware to survive in the long term,\u201d says Francisco Jeronimo, a smartphone analyst for the research group IDC. \u201cBut the big problem for many of these companies is that there isn\u2019t a strong incentive to keep buying them. I might buy a GoPro, but I don\u2019t need it on a daily basis if I have a smartphone. Same with Parrot \u2013 it\u2019s a very niche segment. These companies were so eager to get to an IPO that they took advantage of the hype around their category, but haven\u2019t been able to reinvent themselves, and they need to do that to keep alive.\u201d The risk for such companies is that they are consigned to the virtual, or real, cupboard under the stairs to gather dust, while smartphone capability expands to take on functions that once needed a separate device. Yet it\u2019s never been easier to make and sell hardware. Crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo provide easy ways to find early adopters who will stake money on entrepreneurs with unproven designs, which can then be realised in Shenzhen. The Pebble smartwatch raised $10.3m as a Kickstarter project in 2012, then its biggest-ever fundraising; it topped that in 2015, raising $20.3m for a newer model. Yet in December 2016 it announced it would close, citing financial trouble. (Fitbit bought its intellectual property \u2013 essentially, the smartwatch software \u2013 for $23m.) \u201cCrowdfunding sites are great for attracting early adopters, but the majority of consumers don\u2019t go there,\u201d says Jeronimo. \u201cIt misleads companies into thinking their category is going to explode.\u201d Even while it tried to expand beyond those early adopters, Pebble\u2019s problem (which is now also Fitbit\u2019s problem) was that Apple launched its own smartwatch in 2015, and quickly became the largest smartwatch maker. Sonos, similarly, found that a market it once had to itself \u2013 multi-room speakers streaming music and radio from the internet \u2013 turned into a jostling match with Amazon in 2014, followed by Google and most recently, Apple. Suddenly, everyone is making a \u201csmart speaker\u201d, and Sonos\u2019s hardware-only model has come into sharp focus because it doesn\u2019t have a native voice assistant (it is adding Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s \u2018OK Google\u2019). The ability for the big players to squash smaller players isn\u2019t unique to hardware; Facebook has tried to do it to rivals such as Snapchat. But in hardware, firms such as Sonos find themselves assaulted by both the big brands and the unheard-of ones leveraging Shenzhen and Amazon\u2019s distribution. Sonos\u2019s response has been to insist that people will move upmarket, to its better sound quality. It is also looking for collaborations, most notably with Ikea, whose fruits are promised in 2019. Patrick Spence, the Sonos CEO, is confident he can rely on the existing Sonos user base of 20m devices across 7.4m households. \u201cWe have a strong base of existing customers that we can tap into and have a good relationship with,\u201d he said in November. \u201cAnd so, I think that puts us at an advantage, [compared with rivals] quite frankly.\u201d But Amazon is coming up fast: it is reckoned to have 35m of its Echo devices installed in the US alone. The squeeze on smaller hardware players has played out before, in PCs and smartphones. In the mid-1990s, the PC market was dominated by American companies such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Gateway, Apple, Compaq, NCR, Packard Bell and Zenith. As manufacturing costs in the US rose, they shifted production to Taiwan, South Korea and, gradually, China \u2013 only to be usurped by local rivals using that manufacturing expertise and building international distribution networks. Now, only Dell, HP and Apple remain; the three other biggest PC makers are Acer and Asus, of Taiwan, and China\u2019s Lenovo. Similarly in smartphones, the early advantage that American companies such as BlackBerry and Motorola had in 2009 was quickly eroded as the market expanded. Now there are hundreds of Chinese companies offering smartphones.

      "bodyText": "US supreme court chief justice John Roberts is using his annual report on the federal judiciary to highlight the steps the branch has taken to combat inappropriate conduct in the workplace. In December 2017, Roberts asked that a working group be put together to examine the judiciary\u2019s workplace conduct policies. His request followed news reports about prominent federal appeals court judge Alex Kozinski, who retired following multiple accusations by women, including former law clerks, that he had touched them inappropriately, made lewd comments and showed them pornography. The working group of judges and judiciary officials that Roberts asked be convened issued a report in June, finding that inappropriate conduct is not widespread among the judiciary branch\u2019s 30,000 employees but also is \u201cnot limited to a few isolated instances\u201d. The group offered a range of recommendations for further action. Roberts, in his New Year\u2019s Eve report issued just before midnight, endorsed those recommendations, which focus on revising the codes of conduct the judiciary has for judges and employees, streamlining the process for identifying and correcting misconduct, and expanding training programs aimed at preventing inappropriate behavior. Roberts did not say anything in the report about the sexual assault allegations that nearly derailed the confirmation of the court\u2019s newest justice, Brett Kavanaugh, and enraged many. In testimony before senators in September, psychology professor Dr Christine Blasey Ford alleged that a drunken Kavanaugh violently restrained her and attempted to rape her at a party when they were teenagers. Kavanaugh denied the allegations. Also, last year, before he became a supreme court nominee, Kavanaugh hired the son of Kozinski, a close friend, to serve as his clerk, even though the clerk, Clayton Kozinski, had not earned a spot on the Yale Law Journal, as almost all of Kavanaugh\u2019s previous Yale clerks had. The decision to hire Clayton Kozinski smacked of the kind of cronyism that is rife in federal courts. It was especially common for Kavanaugh, who not only had a reputation for hiring \u201cmodel-like\u201d female clerks, but also the children of powerful friends and allies. Roberts, meanwhile, noted that the working group did not give the judiciary branch \u201ca completely clean bill of health\u201d and that it concluded that when misconduct happens it is \u201cmore likely to take the form of incivility or disrespect than overt sexual harassment\u201d and \u201cfrequently goes unreported\u201d. Roberts noted that since the working group\u2019s report was issued, changes to the judiciary\u2019s code of conduct and disciplinary procedures have been proposed, including enlarging the definition of workplace misconduct. Other changes include lengthening the time that employees have to report misconduct. The administrative office of the United States courts, which oversees the day-to-day operation of the federal courts, has also created an office of judicial integrity to monitor workplace conduct issues. Individual federal courts have also been studying their workplaces and adopting changes, and Roberts said the supreme court would also add to its existing policies and training programs. The working group Roberts instituted will remain in place for the next year to monitor progress. \u201cThe job is not finished until we have done all that we can to ensure that all of our employees are treated with fairness, dignity and respect,\u201d Roberts wrote.",

Paul Baker Director, Vector Research Limited, Birmingham \u2022 You write that \u201cGlasgow\u2019s year as European capital of culture [in 1990] can certainly be seen as one of a complex series of factors that have turned the city into the powerhouse of art, music and theatre that it remains today\u201d. Perhaps a rather more important factor is that Glasgow was one of the twin cities of the Scottish Enlightenment. Glasgow was a powerhouse of art, music, theatre and culture for centuries before it was awarded the status of European capital of culture. Please note that I write this as a committed Scottish European.

      "bodyText": "Venus Unwrapped This is the start of a year-long celebration of female composers at Kings Place. The history of women in music, from medieval times to the present day, will be traced in 60 events featuring more than 100 composers. It all begins with a portrait of Barbara Strozzi, contemporary of Monteverdi and pupil of Cavalli. Kings Place, London, 10 January and throughout 2019 The Queen of Spades Since his Verdi at Covent Garden and Debussy at Glyndebourne, director Stefan Herheim is no longer an unknown quantity in the UK. And his startling 2016 staging of Tchaikovsky\u2019s Queen of Spades, first seen in Amsterdam, which makes the composer himself the central character, promises to be a highlight of the Royal Opera season. Royal Opera House, London, 13 January-1 February SoundState The Southbank Centre\u2019s new festival of contemporary music packs a lot into five days. Ensemble Modern joins the SBC\u2019s resident orchestras, flautist Claire Chase and composers Rebecca Saunders and Du Yun are featured artists, while the premieres include works by Louis Andriessen, Helen Grime, Dai Fujikura and Anders Hillborg. Southbank Centre, London, 16-20 January Anthropocene Scottish Opera\u2019s latest commission sees composer Stuart MacRae and writer Louise Walsh\u2019s most ambitious collaboration yet. Anthropocene is set on an expedition to Greenland, when an Arctic research team discovers something unexpected beneath the ice. Matthew Richardson directs the premiere, with Stuart Stratford conducting. Theatre Royal, Glasgow, 24, 26 January, then touring K\u00e1tya Kabanov\u00e1 Given the sheer breadth of the repertory nowadays, it\u2019s remarkable that three versions of the same Jan\u00e1\u010dek opera should be opening in the UK within a few weeks. Opera North revive Tim Albery\u2019s 2007 production, while those at the Royal Opera and Scottish Opera are brand new, directed by Richard Jones and Stephen Lawless respectively. Opera North: Grand Theatre, Leeds, 2-27 February, then touring; Royal Opera: Royal Opera House, London, 4-26 February; Scottish Opera: Theatre Royal, Glasgow, 12-16 March, Festival theatre, Edinburgh, 21 and 23 March Thomas Larcher Larcher\u2019s music may not be very well known here so far, but with a residency at the Aldeburgh festival this coming summer, and three works included in the BBC Symphony Orchestra\u2019s current Barbican season, that is going to change. Karina Cannellakis conducts the UK premiere of Larcher\u2019s Alle Tage, while his Insomnia begins Sakari Oramo\u2019s concert. Barbican, London, 8 February and 22 February Un Ballo in Maschera Welsh National Opera\u2019s departing artistic director David Pountney and former music director Carlo Rizzi continue their Verdi series with one of his most enigmatic masterpieces. They opt for the American version of the Ballo score, with Glyn Hughes Jones as Riccardo, Mary Elizabeth Williams as Amelia and Roland Wood as Renato. Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff, 9-23 February, then touring Berlioz With 2019 short on big musical centenaries, the 150th anniversary of the death of Berlioz features prominently. Manchester is the early focus, with concert performances of the dramatic legend The Damnation of Faust and the opera B\u00e9atrice et B\u00e9n\u00e9dict, while in Glasgow the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra plays the rarely heard sequel to the Symphonie Fantastique, L\u00e9lio. Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, 10 February (Damnation of Faust) , 16 February (B\u00e9atrice et B\u00e9n\u00e9dict); City Halls, Glasgow, 17 February (L\u00e9lio) Into the Little Hill A concert performance of George Benjamin\u2019s first foray into music theatre, his bewitching retelling of the Pied Piper story, with Anu Komsi and Helena Rasker as the soloists, is the focus of the composer\u2019s concert with Ensemble Modern, which also features the premiere of a commission from Cathy Milliken and works by Christian Mason and Luigi Dallapiccola. Wigmore Hall, London, 5 March Haitink at 90 Bernard Haitink has been part of London musical life for so long he has associations with almost all the capital\u2019s orchestras. But in recent years he has appeared most regularly with the London Symphony Orchestra, and it\u2019s with them he is celebrating his 90th birthday, conducting the fourth symphonies of Bruckner and Mahler, alongside concertos by Mozart and Dvorak.

Their last album, Dose Your Dreams, was an 18-track conceptual work that returned to the character of David, from 2011\u2019s similarly sprawling David Comes to Life, and took in everything from prog rock and psychedelia to industrial music and disco.

In the intervening period, drummer John Bradbury has died, guitarist Roddy Byers and vocalist Neville Staple have left. How the remaining trio \u2013 vocalist Terry Hall, guitarist Lynval Golding and bassist Horace Panter \u2013 will fare without them is an intriguing question, although early reports are promising.<br><em>Released 1 February</em></p> <h2>Jimothy Lacoste</h2> <p>The videos Jimothy Lacoste has uploaded to YouTube have become something of a talking point in recent months: are his optimistic lyrics, guileless rapping style and exuberant dancing for real, or one of those impenetrable millennial gags where irony is piled on irony? He insists it\u2019s the former; whatever the answer, there is something undeniably charming and catchy about his music.<br><em>Tour begins 6 February, <a href=\"https://www.kingtuts.co.uk/jimothy-lacoste\">King Tut\u2019s Wah Wah Hut, Glasgow</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adc7e23ea9ff461002d5dc102876217c5765e4a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adc7e23ea9ff461002d5dc102876217c5765e4a1/0_1161_3768_4213/894.jpg\" alt=\"Jimothy Lacoste.\" width=\"894\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Optimistic \u2026 Jimothy Lacoste.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Gerrish/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>AJ Tracey: AJ Tracey</h2> <p>Expectations are high for the debut album by the rapper formerly known as Looney. Last year, his self-released single Butterflies made the Top 20, and its dancefloor inflections provide a clue to his eponymously titled album\u2019s sound. Keen for his brand of grime to reflect his Trinidadian roots, he has said the album also features a soca influence and, perhaps a little unexpectedly, tracks inspired by country and western.<br><em>Released 8 February</em></p> <h2>Lamont Dozier</h2> <p>A rare UK tour from a genuine soul legend \u2013 both as part of Motown\u2019s world-beating Holland-Dozier-Holland writing team and as a solo artist whose 70s oeuvre, not least the oft-covered Going Back to My Roots, should not be overshadowed by the songs he wrote for others. The tour promises \u201creimagined\u201d versions of his umpteen hits in an intimate, \u201cunplugged\u201d format, interspersed with Dozier telling the stories behind the songs.<br><em>Tour begins 13 February, <a href=\"http://theoldmarket.com/shows/lamont-dozier-support-jo-harman/\">Old Market, Hove</a></em></p> <h2>Post Malone</h2> <p>Should you ever wonder about precisely how much power critics exert over public taste, consider the case of Post Malone, the face-tattoo-bedecked Texan rapper. Released to a widespread yell of horror from reviewers, his second album, Beerbongs and Bentleys, went on to break streaming records on Spotify and reached No 1 on both sides of the Atlantic, making this forthcoming arena tour look not unlike a victory lap.<br><em>Tour begins 14 February, <a href=\"http://3arena.ie/artist/post-malone/2518\">3Arena, Dublin</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4be8890917d3b5e63589529ae7c963b645318674\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4be8890917d3b5e63589529ae7c963b645318674/0_388_4862_2716/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Post Malone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"559\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Breaking records \u2026 Post Malone</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Troye Sivan</h2> <p>As pop stars who rose to fame on television talent shows go, Troye Sivan cuts a pleasingly irregular figure. His second album, Bloom, put his queerness front and centre, quoted Smiths lyrics, featured songs about Grindr and losing one\u2019s virginity as a bottom, and was noticeably influenced by ethereal gothic collective This Mortal Coil. The world could use more pop stars like him.<br><em>Tour begins 23 February, <a href=\"https://academymusicgroup.com/o2academyglasgow/events/1237476/troye-sivan-bloom-tour-tickets\">O2 Academy, Glasgow</a></em></p> <h2>Twenty One Pilots</h2> <p>Trench, the darker, more intense 2018 follow-up to Twenty One Pilots\u2019 multi-platinum breakthrough album Blurryface \u2013 home to ubiquitous millennial moping anthem Stressed Out \u2013 attracted surprisingly strong reviews. The inevitable subsequent arena tour reaches Britain this year: apparently their live show tends towards the spectacular and comes packed with stunts, including something called \u201cvertical crowd surfing\u201d.<br><em>Tour begins 27 February, <a href=\"https://www.resortsworldarena.co.uk/whats-on/twenty-one-pilots/\">Genting Arena, Birmingham</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb4e3a67c6cf6e9f20a4888791044161f98f261b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb4e3a67c6cf6e9f20a4888791044161f98f261b/0_0_5612_3741/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stunts \u2026 Twenty One Pilots\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stunts \u2026 Twenty One Pilots</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Weezer: Weezer</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2018/aug/10/weezer-toto-hash-pipe-africa-inside-story-music-unlikely-love-in\">Weezer</a> frontman Rivers Cuomo has been talking about the US alt-rock quartet\u2019s 12th studio album since before their 11th studio album came out. Intended as a darker counterpart to 2016\u2019s Weezer (The White Album), it was briefly put on hold in favour of the electronically inclined Pacific Daydream. It will be seeing the light of day in March, produced by Dave Sitek and apparently sounding like \u201cthe Beach Boys gone bad\u201d.<br><em>Released 1 March</em></p> <h2>Our Girl</h2> <p>These are not the best of times for what would once have been called indie rock, but Brighton based Our Girl \u2013 another project from Soph Nathan of the Mercury-nominated Big Moon \u2013 bucked the trend with Stranger Today, an atmospheric, potent album packed with great songs recalling the kind of thing 4AD would have released in the late 80s. You can catch glimpses of Pixies and shoegazing about their sound, but there\u2019s a uniqueness and character to it that transcends their influences.<br><em><a href=\"http://weareourgirl.co.uk/home\">Tour</a> begins 4 March, Jacaranda Records Phase One, Liverpool</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"018f0fffcfd71fb44a51e83cb809baa787b4deea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/018f0fffcfd71fb44a51e83cb809baa787b4deea/0_1203_5021_4972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Our Girl.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"990\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Character \u2026 Our Girl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hollie Fernando</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Kamasi Washington</h2> <p>It\u2019s perhaps unfair to lay a resurgence of mainstream interest in jazz at the door of one artist, but there is no doubting the impact of Kamasi Washington\u2019s two sprawling albums, The Epic and Heaven and Earth, and his collaborations with Kendrick Lamar and Run the Jewels. The proof that he draws in a far wider audience than usual without compromising his sound or ambition is that he\u2019s playing a venue the size of Brixton Academy.<br><em><a href=\"https://academymusicgroup.com/o2academybrixton/events/1238590/kamasi-washington-tickets\">Brixton Academy, London</a>, 5 March</em></p> <h2>George Ezra</h2> <p>Of all the fresh-faced, gravel-voiced, acoustic-guitar-toting singer-songwriters who emerged in Ed Sheeran\u2019s wake, George Ezra, perhaps unexpectedly, has proved the most successful. His second album, Staying at Tamara\u2019s, spawned last summer\u2019s most ubiquitous single, Shotgun, and sold half a million copies \u2013 evidence of his ability to unite a section of the market that would once have been called teenyboppers with a more mature, Radio 2-friendly audience. So the crowd at these gigs should be intriguing.<br><em>Tour begins 7 March, <a href=\"https://www.metroradioarena.co.uk/events/george-ezra/\">Metro Radio Arena, Newcastle</a></em></p> <h2>Yxng Bane</h2> <p>A one-off date from Larry Cummings Kiala, yet another east London rapper who has stormed the charts without the aid of a record label. His career kicked off with a dancehall remake of Ed Sheeran\u2019s Shape of You; his sound juggles trap and drill, afro swing and bashment; the screams from the crowd evident at his 2018 gigs suggest pin-up status is upon him. This London show will be his biggest British solo gig to date.<br><em><a href=\"https://academymusicgroup.com/o2academybrixton/events/1238837/yxng-bane-tickets\">Brixton Academy, London</a>, 15 March</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0579ecf562d6ad14403b2476efbc7517280e552e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0579ecf562d6ad14403b2476efbc7517280e552e/0_416_3648_4795/761.jpg\" alt=\"Yxng Bane.\" width=\"761\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pin-up status \u2026 Yxng Bane.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jake Hateley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Nao</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/26/nao-saturn-review\">Nao\u2019s second album, Saturn</a>, was among 2018\u2019s most charming. Less synth-based than her debut, beautifully poised between mainstream R&amp;B, funk, heartstring-tugging ballads and something more psychedelic and leftfield, it avoided the obvious in favour of forging a gently eccentric individual path.<br><em>Tour begins 20 March, <a href=\"https://www.alberthallmanchester.com/event/nao/\">Albert Hall, Manchester</a></em></p> <h2>The Internet</h2> <p>Of all the artists to emerge from the sprawling Odd Future collective, the Internet are, by some distance, the most musically intriguing. While Tyler, the Creator is still capable of grabbing the headlines through his lyrics, Syd and Matt Martian\u2019s band have taken a less controversial route, releasing a string of hugely inventive and futuristic funk/soul albums: last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/22/the-internet-hive-mind-review\">Hive Mind</a> was typically great.<br><em>Tour begins 21 March, <a href=\"https://academymusicgroup.com/o2academybrixton/events/1230745/internet-tickets\">Brixton Academy, London</a></em></p> <h2>Idles</h2> <p>Idles\u2019 second album, Joy As An Act of Resistance, made a big enough impact to warrant some writers dubbing them \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/15/im-not-the-next-billy-bragg-on-the-road-with-idles-joe-talbot\">the most important band in Britain</a>\u201d. Certainly, their arty, jagged take on punk carries a ferocious power, while Joe Talbot\u2019s lyrics hold up a mirror to contemporary Britain with slashing wit and a real tenderness. But they\u2019re a band who are really best experienced live in all their chaotic, tumultuous glory.<br><em>Tour begins 26 March, <a href=\"https://www.leadmill.co.uk/event/idles/\">Leadmill, Sheffield</a></em></p> <h2>Julia Jacklin</h2> <p>Julia Jacklin\u2019s 2016 album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/06/julia-jacklin-dont-let-the-kids-win-review-transgressive\">Don\u2019t Let the Kids Win</a> was a minor masterpiece of off-kilter singer-songwriter quirkiness, its idiosyncrasies charming rather than irritating: witty songs about drugged-out boyfriends and wishing Zach Braff and Catherine Deneuve were her parents, with a country-ish lilt to the music. The forthcoming follow-up, Crushing, promises a \u201crejection of expectations\u201d \u2013 starker, more personal, fewer laughs \u2013 but the single Body was still spine-tingling, and a handful of UK dates last November sold out.<br><em>Tour begins 26 March, <a href=\"https://www.thehauntbrighton.co.uk/juliajacklin\">Haunt, Brighton</a></em></p> <h2>Ray BLK</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/11/why-i-love-ray-blk-crush-bim-adewunmi\">Ray BLK</a> won the BBC\u2019s Sound of 2017 poll, the first unsigned artist to do so. As perhaps should have been expected from an artist whose debut release was an EP based on Miss Havisham from Dickens\u2019s Great Expectations, the path she has followed since has been intriguingly serpentine, some distance from the standard pop-R&amp;B approach. Last year\u2019s Empress, an eight-track project that featured Stormzy, offered ample evidence of her talent.<br><em><a href=\"https://academymusicgroup.com/o2forumkentishtown/events/1215039/ray-blk-tickets\">Kentish Town Forum, London</a>, 28 March</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b01913d73aebb6d3415c087e7c86f9a41f20b401\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b01913d73aebb6d3415c087e7c86f9a41f20b401/0_815_4234_4387/965.jpg\" alt=\"Ray BLK.\" width=\"965\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Serpentine \u2026 Ray BLK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivia Rose</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Giorgio Moroder</h2> <p>This sounds compellingly bizarre: the 78-year-old electronic pioneer heads out on his first tour, in which he will \u201cconduct, play the vocoder, electronic effects and sounds, play the piano\u201d and \u201cshare personal stories that have never left the walls of his studio before\u201d. Titled A Celebration of the 80s, it will also feature a tribute to his most famous collaborator, Donna Summer.<br><em>Tour begins 1 April, <a href=\"https://www.thsh.co.uk/event/giorgio-moroder\">Birmingham Symphony Hall</a></em></p> <h2>Stefflon Don</h2> <p>Stefflon Don is one of the few British MCs who appear to be making headway in the US, thanks partly to her collaborations with Demi Lovato, Future and French Montana, and partly, one suspects, because her flow is less obviously London-accented than her grime peers. She is the first UK artist ever to be included in hip-hop magazine XXL\u2019s prestigious Freshman Class guide to future stars. Her live performances, too, are more spectacular and pop-facing than her grimier peers.<br><em>Tour begins 13 April, <a href=\"https://www.luu.org.uk/union-events/2019/april/stefflon-don-13042019/\">Stylus, Leeds</a></em></p>",

The tour promises \u201creimagined\u201d versions of his umpteen hits in an intimate, \u201cunplugged\u201d format, interspersed with Dozier telling the stories behind the songs. Tour begins 13 February, Old Market, Hove Post Malone Should you ever wonder about precisely how much power critics exert over public taste, consider the case of Post Malone, the face-tattoo-bedecked Texan rapper. Released to a widespread yell of horror from reviewers, his second album, Beerbongs and Bentleys, went on to break streaming records on Spotify and reached No 1 on both sides of the Atlantic, making this forthcoming arena tour look not unlike a victory lap. Tour begins 14 February, 3Arena, Dublin Troye Sivan As pop stars who rose to fame on television talent shows go, Troye Sivan cuts a pleasingly irregular figure. His second album, Bloom, put his queerness front and centre, quoted Smiths lyrics, featured songs about Grindr and losing one\u2019s virginity as a bottom, and was noticeably influenced by ethereal gothic collective This Mortal Coil. The world could use more pop stars like him. Tour begins 23 February, O2 Academy, Glasgow Twenty One Pilots Trench, the darker, more intense 2018 follow-up to Twenty One Pilots\u2019 multi-platinum breakthrough album Blurryface \u2013 home to ubiquitous millennial moping anthem Stressed Out \u2013 attracted surprisingly strong reviews. The inevitable subsequent arena tour reaches Britain this year: apparently their live show tends towards the spectacular and comes packed with stunts, including something called \u201cvertical crowd surfing\u201d. Tour begins 27 February, Genting Arena, Birmingham Weezer: Weezer Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo has been talking about the US alt-rock quartet\u2019s 12th studio album since before their 11th studio album came out. Intended as a darker counterpart to 2016\u2019s Weezer (The White Album), it was briefly put on hold in favour of the electronically inclined Pacific Daydream. It will be seeing the light of day in March, produced by Dave Sitek and apparently sounding like \u201cthe Beach Boys gone bad\u201d. Released 1 March Our Girl These are not the best of times for what would once have been called indie rock, but Brighton based Our Girl \u2013 another project from Soph Nathan of the Mercury-nominated Big Moon \u2013 bucked the trend with Stranger Today, an atmospheric, potent album packed with great songs recalling the kind of thing 4AD would have released in the late 80s. You can catch glimpses of Pixies and shoegazing about their sound, but there\u2019s a uniqueness and character to it that transcends their influences. Tour begins 4 March, Jacaranda Records Phase One, Liverpool Kamasi Washington It\u2019s perhaps unfair to lay a resurgence of mainstream interest in jazz at the door of one artist, but there is no doubting the impact of Kamasi Washington\u2019s two sprawling albums, The Epic and Heaven and Earth, and his collaborations with Kendrick Lamar and Run the Jewels. The proof that he draws in a far wider audience than usual without compromising his sound or ambition is that he\u2019s playing a venue the size of Brixton Academy. Brixton Academy, London, 5 March George Ezra Of all the fresh-faced, gravel-voiced, acoustic-guitar-toting singer-songwriters who emerged in Ed Sheeran\u2019s wake, George Ezra, perhaps unexpectedly, has proved the most successful. His second album, Staying at Tamara\u2019s, spawned last summer\u2019s most ubiquitous single, Shotgun, and sold half a million copies \u2013 evidence of his ability to unite a section of the market that would once have been called teenyboppers with a more mature, Radio 2-friendly audience. So the crowd at these gigs should be intriguing. Tour begins 7 March, Metro Radio Arena, Newcastle Yxng Bane A one-off date from Larry Cummings Kiala, yet another east London rapper who has stormed the charts without the aid of a record label. His career kicked off with a dancehall remake of Ed Sheeran\u2019s Shape of You; his sound juggles trap and drill, afro swing and bashment; the screams from the crowd evident at his 2018 gigs suggest pin-up status is upon him. This London show will be his biggest British solo gig to date. Brixton Academy, London, 15 March Nao Nao\u2019s second album, Saturn, was among 2018\u2019s most charming. Less synth-based than her debut, beautifully poised between mainstream R&amp;B, funk, heartstring-tugging ballads and something more psychedelic and leftfield, it avoided the obvious in favour of forging a gently eccentric individual path. Tour begins 20 March, Albert Hall, Manchester The Internet Of all the artists to emerge from the sprawling Odd Future collective, the Internet are, by some distance, the most musically intriguing. While Tyler, the Creator is still capable of grabbing the headlines through his lyrics, Syd and Matt Martian\u2019s band have taken a less controversial route, releasing a string of hugely inventive and futuristic funk/soul albums: last year\u2019s Hive Mind was typically great. Tour begins 21 March, Brixton Academy, London Idles Idles\u2019 second album, Joy As An Act of Resistance, made a big enough impact to warrant some writers dubbing them \u201cthe most important band in Britain\u201d. Certainly, their arty, jagged take on punk carries a ferocious power, while Joe Talbot\u2019s lyrics hold up a mirror to contemporary Britain with slashing wit and a real tenderness. But they\u2019re a band who are really best experienced live in all their chaotic, tumultuous glory. Tour begins 26 March, Leadmill, Sheffield Julia Jacklin Julia Jacklin\u2019s 2016 album Don\u2019t Let the Kids Win was a minor masterpiece of off-kilter singer-songwriter quirkiness, its idiosyncrasies charming rather than irritating: witty songs about drugged-out boyfriends and wishing Zach Braff and Catherine Deneuve were her parents, with a country-ish lilt to the music. The forthcoming follow-up, Crushing, promises a \u201crejection of expectations\u201d \u2013 starker, more personal, fewer laughs \u2013 but the single Body was still spine-tingling, and a handful of UK dates last November sold out. Tour begins 26 March, Haunt, Brighton Ray BLK Ray BLK won the BBC\u2019s Sound of 2017 poll, the first unsigned artist to do so. As perhaps should have been expected from an artist whose debut release was an EP based on Miss Havisham from Dickens\u2019s Great Expectations, the path she has followed since has been intriguingly serpentine, some distance from the standard pop-R&amp;B approach. Last year\u2019s Empress, an eight-track project that featured Stormzy, offered ample evidence of her talent. Kentish Town Forum, London, 28 March Giorgio Moroder This sounds compellingly bizarre: the 78-year-old electronic pioneer heads out on his first tour, in which he will \u201cconduct, play the vocoder, electronic effects and sounds, play the piano\u201d and \u201cshare personal stories that have never left the walls of his studio before\u201d. Titled A Celebration of the 80s, it will also feature a tribute to his most famous collaborator, Donna Summer. Tour begins 1 April, Birmingham Symphony Hall Stefflon Don Stefflon Don is one of the few British MCs who appear to be making headway in the US, thanks partly to her collaborations with Demi Lovato, Future and French Montana, and partly, one suspects, because her flow is less obviously London-accented than her grime peers. She is the first UK artist ever to be included in hip-hop magazine XXL\u2019s prestigious Freshman Class guide to future stars. Her live performances, too, are more spectacular and pop-facing than her grimier peers. Tour begins 13 April, Stylus, Leeds",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for your company, enjoy the rest of the day. What does that mean for the actual Hopman Cup? Team USA are bottom of Group B, which is led by all-conquering Switzerland, who look on course for Saturday\u2019s final. The competition resumes tomorrow with France v Germany. Andy Murray has been in action in Brisbane as the tennis world decamps to Australia. And here\u2019s that aforementioned selfie. Which followed this: Roger and Serena speak, before taking a selfie together (yes, really). RF: \u201cIt was great fun. What a pleasure. What an honour. Thank you for making it possible.\u201d SW: \u201cIt was a great experience. I\u2019m sorry it had to finish; I was just warming up. It was such fun, we grew up together. It was super cool. I wanted to take pictures and bring my baby out.\u201d RF: \u201cI was nervous about the serve. It was nerve-wracking, too. I thought I had got to win this point but it is Serena Williams. I made the serve and I missed the area and I want to thank you for missing the ball.\u201d SW: \u201cThis guy is great, both off the court and on the court. I think his serve is super-underestimated. It\u2019s a killer serve, you can\u2019t read it. I watched him all the time and I never knew how amazing it was.\u201d History was made and Federer was the victor though Serena, it has to be said, was not at her best. Time to worry about that shoulder? Second set tie-break: First to five, remember, with no need to win by two. There is some confusion over who serves when. The USA pair sure to 2-0. Then another Serena error makes it 2-1. Then Tiafoe makes a mistake from a fine Bencic daisycutter to make it 2-2. Serena recovers her fire to smash an overhead to make it 3-2. Tiafoe thought he had won an ace for 4-2 but VAR shows he was fractions out. Federer makes it 3-3 and then serves. It goes to 4-3 and match point. Then his superb, angled volley off Tiafoe\u2019s return gives the Americans no chance. And that\u2019s it! Second set: Bencic/Federer* 3-3 Williams/Tiafoe (*denotes server): Federer serves to Williams from the start. Serena keeps feeling her right shoulder; she has not been at her best today. Federer serves straight to 40-0. Then Tiafoe\u2019s failed return of a Federer volley takes us into the tie-break. Second set: Bencic/Federer 2-3 Williams/Tiafoe* (*denotes server): Tiafoe serves again, and Bencic misses a chance for a winner at 15-15. Williams does the same in the very next point. A Federer error makes it 40-30 to the Americans. Then Serena has a winning chance as Federer makes a mess of a lob. That leaves a deciding point which Tiafoe holds after Federer\u2019s return comes back to him. A nervy hold for the Americans. Second set: Bencic/Federer* 1-2 Williams/Tiafoe (*denotes server): Bencic serves and the first flurry sees Tiafoe smash the ball into Federer\u2019s chops. No real harm done and it\u2019s all smiles. The crowd giggle as only a tennis crowd can. Bencic is pushed to 15-30 and then makes a fine serve to level. Her next shot is not good, as she skews the ball into the house lights. Federer comes to the rescue. Here is the deciding point from this Fast4 malarkey: and Bencic booms an ace past Williams. Great stuff from her after going a little wobbly. Second set: Bencic/Federer 1-2 Williams/Tiafoe* (*denotes server): Serena serves now, and commits her own double fault. Then she and Federer get involved in a rally, he at the net, she at the baseline. Tiafoe fluffs his lines for the smash and the game goes to 30-30. Then Bencic makes a mess of her own chance to smash home and win a break point. Bencic goes long with a return to hand the Americans the lead in this set. Second set: Bencic/Federer* 1-1 Williams/Tiafoe (*denotes server): Federer serves once more. A battle at the net ends up with the ball smashing off Tiafoe. There is some banter and japery as he falls swanlike to the floor. This *is* a friendly, after all. Meanwhile, the Federer serve fails him as he double faults. Then comes a beauty for 40-15, then another that Serena can only drift into Bencic\u2019s orbit. The game is claimed with a smash. Second set: Bencic/Federer 0-1 Williams/Tiafoe* (*denotes server): Tiafoe serves first again. Which is something of a surprise. He is receiving plenty of advice from Serena though it is her error that takes it to 30-30. Bencic misses a winner to miss out on a break point. And Serena, at the net, takes the game with a crashing overhead. First set: Bencic/Federer* 4-2 Williams/Tiafoe (*denotes server): Federer serves. And hits a winner on his second serve. Tiafoe has no answer to the next, to make it 15-15. Then Federer takes control. He wins the set with a crashed forehand that Serena can only wallop low into the net. First set: Bencic/Federer 3-2 Williams/Tiafoe* (*denotes server): Tiafoe and Federer exchange some volleys; the American wins the first duel. Then Federer\u2019s sharp volley, from hip-level, has Serena shouting out in anguish. A Bencic return gives the Swiss break point at 15-40. Then Tiafoe\u2019s error hands the game over. Federer will serve for the set. First set: Bencic/Federer* 2-2 Williams/Tiafoe (*denotes server): Bencic is last to serve. She catches out both opponents with her first two serves. Tiafoe, though, does some great work to charge forward and pick up the ball to make it 15-30. Then comes a punched Federer volley for 40-15. A double fault from Bencic is untimely but she recovers herself to win the next point with some sharp volleying. First set: Bencic/Federer 1-2 Williams/Tiafoe* (*denotes server): Williams serves now. And Tiafoe\u2019s smash bludgeons the ball beyond Bencic for 30-0. Serena launches a bomb at Federer for her first serve. It goes out. The second serve catches him out, though. Then Serena claims the game with a serve down the centre line. First set: Bencic/Federer* 1-1 Williams/Tiafoe (*denotes server): Federer serves first for the Swiss team. Serena\u2019s first attempt at a winner on his serve goes wide. Then Tiafoe plays a neat, angled drop shot to make it 15-15. Federer then beats Williams on his serve. Tiafoe fails with the next Federer serve, and Serena cannot return his wide-angled serve to level up the match. First set: Bencic/Federer 0-1 Williams/Tiafoe* (*denotes server): Tiafoe serves first. And the first point sees Federer, at the back of the court, chase down a Williams smash. Then Federer makes a mess of his own smash but then it goes to 15-30. A smart volley at the net from Serena makes it 30-30. Then a good serve from Tiafoe takes it to 40-30, which is served out. They are knocking up. The first question is who will serve first for the Americans? And after that, will Williams be able to ace Federer? The toss is made and Tiafoe and Williams will serve first. A reminder from the TV graphics that the two greats have won $200m in prize money between them. Add in the endorsements and all the rest of it, and you are perhaps looking at half a billion dollars. And on second are Tiafoe and Williams. Plenty of smiles for them too. Federer looks cool, as per usual as he takes to the court. Bencic, his partner, looks remarkably smiley considering what befell her just a few minutes ago, particularly in that second set. Here come the players. House of Pain\u2019s Jump Around - AKA the worst record ever made and a pox on any occasion - is the current soundtrack. The crowd are getting revved up for this one. And with good reason, as this is something of a historic occasion. How are they getting revved up? They are dancing to The Village People\u2019s YMCA. Federer is just as excited as Serena ahead of this meeting of legends. Reminder that the mixed doubles will be a Fast4 match. What does that mean? Wikipedia takes the strain. \u201cThe shortened format offers a \u201cfast\u201d alternative to tennis, with four points, four games and four rules: there are no advantage scores, lets are played, tie-breakers apply at three games all and the first to four games wins the set.\u201d And if we have a tie-break? \u201cSimilar to 12 point tiebreaker but with a few format changes especially on service order. First player to 5 points. Each player serves twice starting in deuce court switching sides after 4 points. At 4-all, a coin toss by the umpire (or racquet spin if none is present) determines who will serve the ninth point with the receiving player choosing sides on the final point.\u201d Got that? Good. Serena speaks: She played really well. I knew I could play better; that was always in my mind. [On the mixed doubles] It\u2019s super exciting and I just feel honoured to be on the same court as him. He has had a fantastic career and it\u2019s not done yet. We are the exact same, we have been there since the Nineties. Regardless of what happens, this is a moment I will always cherish. What that means is that we do go down to the mixed doubles and that first ever meeting between Serena and Federer will be \u2018live\u2019. Williams tries to get the job done quickly with two powerful serves taking her to 30-0. A wild backhand takes Bencic back to 30-15. Bencic calls the ball out and stops running as she asks for the VAR. She is right. 30-30 it is. Then comes match point after a huge Serena serve. She needs a second serve, though. And then comes a similar challenge from Serena, but she is wrong. The ball was in. Some smiles between the players. At deuce comes a big serve then it\u2019s another second service on the second serve. After a short rally, Bencic hits the ball out. Her challenge is in vain. It\u2019s now 5-3 to Williams in the final set. Serena challenges a shot that was called out. Bencic was beaten and the Williams radar is in full working order. Then she rips a shot that beats Bencic at the net. The Swiss player then serves out with two excellent serves. It\u2019s 5-2 but that took a long while; Williams\u2019 level has dropped a little as she closes in on victory. Perhaps she has an eye on the mixed doubles ahead but some loose play in evidence. And there is a scream of agony as she concedes a break point with a wild slash at the ball. Then she manages to save it when Bencic is a little too timid when a winner was there for the taking. It goes to deuce twice over. Then comes a trademark thrash down the line to save another break point and a wide serve that catches Bencic out. Another deuce, though, beckons after a howler of a missed winner. Some anger with herself after an ace pings through and then another serve blasts through Bencic\u2019s racket. Bencic has not given up just yet; to go 30-0 up she hits the ball straight at Serena, and then goes to 40-15 with a lovely, sweeping winner. The game is claimed with some ease, and it\u2019s 4-2. Nasty slip by Bencic, who has had her fair share of injuries over the years, but she gets up to play a lob that catches Serena out. Serena, though, roars \u201ccome on!\u201d in true style as she makes it back to 30-30. Then comes 40-30 via an ace. And the game and 4-1 arrives via a Bencic miss. The agony piling on for Bencic? She looks bewildered as she makes another error. She does, though, battle back to go 40-30 up. And then serves well to win the game. Perhaps she is not finished just yet. Williams sends Bencic around the houses with some cool and calm stroke play as she serves to love to go 3-0 up. Nice and easy. Too easy; Bencic looks gone. Bencic, perhaps understandably, has lost something of the lustre she showed in that golden run of points and games. Williams bludgeoned a winner to claim a break point and then Bencic double faults. That\u2019s 2-0 to Williams. And the road to victory has opened up. Williams serves out the first game in the third set with some ease, and looks far calmer than when the pressure went on in the latter part of that second set. A break in play sees Bencic get lost on the way to the dressing room, which doesn\u2019t bode well for her state of mind. That was a big chance blown in that final break. She barely offered up a defence to Serena. Bencic misses a big winner to put Williams 30-15 up. And she knows it, too. Then comes an error as she nets a ball she would expect to thrash home. Then, she fails to put pressure on the next point. Bencic fell apart at the moment of truth. Serena keeps the volume high but this time she is triumphant as she sees out her service game to go 5-4 up. There were a couple of double faults thrown in, though. She can claim the second set with a break in the next. A wail of agony from Serena as she misses a service return. Whatever happens now, she does not look in the best of nick; plenty to work on ahead of Melbourne it would seem. Another howl of indignation marks Bencic making it 4-4. Williams pulls herself off the ropes to go 4-3 up. Bencic\u2019s wiles take her to 30-0 up and a break seems likely. But the game swings back to 30-30. And then 40-30, when Bencic goes for a misses a big winner. The quality of service from Bencic has been of seven-star level. What she lack in power is made up for with the variation and skid she puts on the ball. She cruises to a hold ad it\u2019s 3-3. Serena is making plenty of noise out on the court; she knows she is in a real battle. There may be questions over her mobility, too. But nevertheless, she serves out to go 3-2 up. Bencic is not yet for wavering. Her serve continues to be excellent. And she wins the four game to go 2-2, with Serena making a real mess of the return for game point. Bencic runs into the net to concede a point when Serena had made a desperate block volley. That proves to be the key point of a game the American wins to go 2-1 up in the second set. Bencic\u2019s serving is catching Williams out time and again; her second serve to go to 40-0 has Serena calling out in anguish. The Swiss player serves out to love for 1-1. Serena tries to lift herself after the break. That big guns come out with some fearsome hitting. And she serves out to win the first game of the second set to 15. Another Williams error makes it 11 points in a row. Then it\u2019s 12. And that equals a set point for Bencic, which Williams saves for number 13. The next point, though sees Williams go long. What a turnaround: it\u2019s 5-4 to Bencic! Serena responds with venom in her own serve but her level of intensity appears to have dropped off. She faces a break point, having decided not to challenge a point that was hers and called out. And loses that, broken to love. That\u2019s four games in succession for Bencic. It\u2019s 4-4! Bencic begins her service game with three excellent serves and then Williams makes an error on the fourth. Serena, all of a sudden, looks the flustered one. Well well! Bencic has broken Serena and we are back on serve. It\u2019s 3-4 and back with serve. Bencic has not given up just yet and serves far better to take it to 2-4. As these two are set to meet in the doubles later on, she cannot just let this slip away. Bencic holds her serve to 15 for 1-3. Some relief in her eyes and the crowd show their approval. Nobody likes a walkover though 4-1 to Serena is soon to arrive. A slight wobble at the start of Serena\u2019s second service game but she blasts back from 30-0 down. Bencic is being overwhelmed and looks overwhelmed but does scrape to deuce but another salvo takes it to 3-0. Serena holds her serve with gusto, and the serve itself looks in full working order for 2019. She needs to win here, of course. And she breaks Bencic to go 2-0 up, having done so to love. This may be a brief affair. Some New Year\u2019s R-Fed for your delight and delectation. Belinda Bencic is in the tunnel, looking relaxed as she waits for Serena. Plenty of smiles; Federer lifted the pressure with that win. In fact, she doesn\u2019t even wait for Williams and walks on to court. Serena, wired for sound with some decorous headphones, steps out. And looks hugely confident. The response from the crowd is suitably loud. Serena elects to serve first. \u201cI hope I don\u2019t get injured from here until the doubles,\u201d deadpans Federer. \u201cI\u2019ll stay on the bike and keep the engine on. I had a really late night last night on New Year\u2019s Eve \u2026 I\u2019m joking,\u201d he laughs. \u201cAnd what a match \u2013 I\u2019m really looking forward to playing Serena here in Perth.\u201d The crowd like that. Right, I\u2019m going to hand over to my colleague John Brewin now, who will keep you up to speed with the score between Serena Williams and Belinda Bencic before taking you through the mixed doubles game-by-game. Tiafoe ends a run of seven games against him to get a game on the board but he can\u2019t break Federer, who takes the first singles match for Switzerland with minimum fuss, winning to love. He was tested in the first set and then the youngster crumbled as he found form. It\u2019s happened to many against the great man. Tiafoe will have to regroup for mixed doubles. \u201cI played another good match, I\u2019m very happy. It\u2019s quick conditions. He has a big first serve. He was going big on his second serve in that match too.\u201d Federer is back in the groove now. He\u2019s found his rhythm and is sending the youngster scuttling back and forth in vain attempts to put out fires. He holds, breaks him again and then holds again with little trouble to take a 5-0 lead. Federer looks like he wants to conserve some energy for mixed doubles. He starts to turn the screw and races into a 2-0 lead in the second set. Tiafone battles to save two breaks points against Federer but he can\u2019t save the third. Like the pro he is, Federer moves through the gears when it matters most. He gives Tiafoe the runaround, forcing his opponent into a couple of errors and taking the game to 30-40. The youngster cracks and hands the set to Federer. This is a decent match. Federer is not having it all his own way and is still trying to force one too many shots against the powerful Tiafoe. It\u2019s 4-4. Federer hasn\u2019t been at his slick best here, looking a little rusty at times as he calibrates for a new season. He\u2019s made five unforced errors to the youngster\u2019s four. He still has little trouble holding serve, mind, and takes a 2-1 lead before Tiafoe works his socks off to level at 2-2. We won\u2019t be updating this liveblog game-by-game until the mixed doubles when, hopefully, the tie will still be in the balance, but we will keep you up to speed with the scores from the two singles matches. I can tell you that it\u2019s 1-1 after a plucky first game by the big-serving Tiafoe, who held after being taken to deuce. Roger Federer takes little over two minutes to win his first game to love against Tiafoe, not giving his young opponent a sniff. Switzerland are the defending champions in the Hopman Cup. They won their first match so they can afford a slip-up but the USA unexpectedly lost to Greece so need to win here to have any chance of progressing to Saturday\u2019s final.

His idea was quite simple: he wanted to breed a rose that combined the rosette-shaped flowers and fragrance of Old Roses such as gallicas, albas and damasks, with the repeat-flowering characteristics of Hybrid Tea roses such as the bestselling Peace. While that might sound straightforward, it was to take him decades to achieve his goal.</p> <p>By the beginning of the 20th century Hybrid Tea roses had all but supplanted Old Roses in the garden, thanks to their compact form, the fact that they flowered in several flushes throughout the summer and the huge range of colours available.</p> <p>Unfortunately it is very often the case in plant hybridisation that one characteristic is enhanced at the expense of another, and while some Hybrid Tea varieties retained a wonderful fragrance, many of them had no scent whatsoever.</p> <p>In addition, it was difficult to incorporate such awkward, angular plants into any garden landscape other than a dedicated rose bed, which for half the year consisted of nothing but brown twigs and stems.</p> <p>Old Roses also had their problems. They bloomed only once and tended to have a limited colour palette, from white through to dark pink and mauve. From a breeder\u2019s point of view they were also hard work: seed was not always produced, or if it materialised did not always germinate.

      "body": "<p>My friend Janet Summerton, who has died aged 79, spent much of her working life devoted to primary and then higher education as part of her career in the world of arts and culture.</p> <p>Born in Solihull, West Midlands, to Edwin Summerton, who worked in insurance, and his wife, Maggie (nee Jones), Janet emigrated with her family to Canada after the end of the second world war when she was seven, settling in Vancouver.</p> <p>She went to <a href=\"https://westvancouverschools.ca/westvancouver-secondary/\" title=\"\">West Vancouver secondary school</a> and then trained as a teacher, initially working in primary education and eventually as principal of an experimental school in the city. After five years in that post, and ready for a change, she left to set up a couple of small business ventures, one designing and manufacturing a portable loom and another running her own catering outlet.</p> <p>In the mid-1970s she became coordinator of the Circle Craft Arts Co-op in Vancouver and a decade later she moved back to Britain to begin a PhD at City University, London, focusing on designer craft practices. </p> <p>From the early 90s she taught arts and cultural management at City, as well as at Dartington College of Arts in Devon. From 1994 she led the certificate course in arts management at Sussex University in Brighton, East Sussex, convening the MA in arts and cultural management there until 2004. In \u201cretirement\u201d she continued with freelance work in research, university teaching and training until her 70th year in 2008.</p> <p>A twinkly, wise woman with a huge capacity for supporting others, her thinking was radical and humane. She also communicated brilliantly in her many papers and publications. </p> <p>On a night train in France, en route to an opera festival in 1985, Janet met Ken Goodwin, who had just taken early retirement from BT. Their connection was instantaneous and they were a very close couple for 32 years, marrying in 1991. With shared interests in music, food and putting the world to rights, they drew in a wide and eclectic circle of friends. Janet became an important part of Ken\u2019s family. She also remained close to her sister, Ann, and their mother, Maggie, who moved from Vancouver to live with the couple.</p> <p>Once living in Brighton, Janet became involved with several local cultural organisations. She rediscovered her love of textile work, exhibiting with others, and also opened up her house as part of <a href=\"https://aoh.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Brighton Artists\u2019 Open Houses</a> festival.</p> <p>She is survived by Ken, three stepchildren, Nick, Rod and Caroline, her nieces, Heather and Kim, and her nephew Robert. Ann died last year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "My friend Janet Summerton, who has died aged 79, spent much of her working life devoted to primary and then higher education as part of her career in the world of arts and culture. Born in Solihull, West Midlands, to Edwin Summerton, who worked in insurance, and his wife, Maggie (nee Jones), Janet emigrated with her family to Canada after the end of the second world war when she was seven, settling in Vancouver. She went to West Vancouver secondary school and then trained as a teacher, initially working in primary education and eventually as principal of an experimental school in the city. After five years in that post, and ready for a change, she left to set up a couple of small business ventures, one designing and manufacturing a portable loom and another running her own catering outlet. In the mid-1970s she became coordinator of the Circle Craft Arts Co-op in Vancouver and a decade later she moved back to Britain to begin a PhD at City University, London, focusing on designer craft practices. From the early 90s she taught arts and cultural management at City, as well as at Dartington College of Arts in Devon. From 1994 she led the certificate course in arts management at Sussex University in Brighton, East Sussex, convening the MA in arts and cultural management there until 2004. In \u201cretirement\u201d she continued with freelance work in research, university teaching and training until her 70th year in 2008. A twinkly, wise woman with a huge capacity for supporting others, her thinking was radical and humane. She also communicated brilliantly in her many papers and publications. On a night train in France, en route to an opera festival in 1985, Janet met Ken Goodwin, who had just taken early retirement from BT. Their connection was instantaneous and they were a very close couple for 32 years, marrying in 1991. With shared interests in music, food and putting the world to rights, they drew in a wide and eclectic circle of friends. Janet became an important part of Ken\u2019s family. She also remained close to her sister, Ann, and their mother, Maggie, who moved from Vancouver to live with the couple. Once living in Brighton, Janet became involved with several local cultural organisations. She rediscovered her love of textile work, exhibiting with others, and also opened up her house as part of Brighton Artists\u2019 Open Houses festival. She is survived by Ken, three stepchildren, Nick, Rod and Caroline, her nieces, Heather and Kim, and her nephew Robert. Ann died last year.",

Graeme Souness on Sky offers a defence of Puel, who he calls a \u201cfootball man\u201d who doesn\u2019t have \u201cthe waffle and toffee that seems to be around so much these days\u201d. He\u2019s a \u201ccommon-sense football person\u201d, he says. He may have a point. The one thing I would say that probably works against Puel is how quiet he is. I wonder if that\u2019s why Vardy had to run over to the touchline to get instructions off him. Maybe the whispering Frenchman should be given a megaphone to get his in-match tactical tweaks across to his players. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c2b797be4b02fb91ff0c5f3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-01T14:33:57.466Z\">2.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jamie Vardy, the matchwinner, speaks:</strong> \u201cI think we needed to put the last performance behind us. To come away in new year and get three points was a great start.\u201d On what he said when he spoke to Puel on the touchline in the first half: \u201cI just asked the manager what was the plan in stopping them in the build up from the back. The boss told me to get some information on to [his teammates] and in the second half we pressed better. Ricky [Ricardo] found me with a great pass and thankfully it went in.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c2b783be4b0cebe7617e2b5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-01T14:29:25.302Z\">2.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Claude Puel must be mightily relieved to have won that.</strong> Even if the owners aren\u2019t happy with him, while Leicester sit in seventh it\u2019s hard for them to sack him. His tactical switch in bringing Albrighton on for Ghezzal helped to win the game. Digne could not get forwards in the second half and Albrighton\u2019s wing play gave Everton\u2019s defence more to think about and afforded Vardy just al little more space. Jonny Evans was a rock at the back too and Ben Chilwell impressed as ever. But Puel\u2019s so lucky to have a striker who is as lethal as Vardy. One half-chance, one goal. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c2b7761e4b072dc52e66a21\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-01T14:24:07.106Z\">2.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Full-time: Everton 0-1 Leicester</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Peep! And that\u2019s that. A really poor game is brought to an end. Leicester move up to seventh after a deserved win thanks to an improved second-half performance in which Albrighton helped spark snappier forward play. Everton are booed off. They were awful. They had zero creativity until Bernard came on and Keane\u2019s horrific touch at the back cost them the game. They\u2019re down to 10th and Silva has some thinking to do about how to get his side back on track. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f10735989a26ed551eecf6f43fb46923a880eff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f10735989a26ed551eecf6f43fb46923a880eff/0_8_1815_1174/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A poor festive run for Everton and Marco Silva.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poor festive run for Everton and Marco Silva.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-01T14:26:59.060Z\">at 2.26pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c2b7739e4b0cebe7617e2a8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-01T14:21:17.074Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90+2 min: </strong>Vardy, who was lethal when it most mattered, is replaced by Gray.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c2b76c3e4b0cebe7617e2a5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-01T14:20:31.944Z\">2.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90+1 min:</strong> Everton almost score!

Both have had topsy-turvy seasons so far. Everton looked like they were making steady progress until the defeat at Liverpool, in which they played well. Following that they have lost four, drawn two and won only once (heavily at Burnley on Boxing Day). They were beaten by Brighton last time out. </p> <p>As for Leicester, the two wondrous results against Chelsea and Manchester City were quickly forgotten at the King Power Stadium as boos rang out following the 1-0 defeat by Cardiff last weekend. Claude Puel still very much looks like a manager expecting the chop even if that is ludicrous given their league position. Leicester\u2019s natural home should be somewhere between 10th and seventh \u2013 so, exactly where they are now.</p> <p>Lifting the club back up to seventh today would surely help his case given that to achieve anything better than that would mean usurping clubs with much greater wealth. The miraculous title win really has skewed expectations at the King Power. Puel is a victim of his own mid-table consistency. The French Curbs? Somebody has to deal with the transition of the title-winning side into regular Premier League mainstays, though. The French Curbs? As for Silva, a win would get disgruntled Toffees back on side, not that his job is under threat, but with the talent he has at his disposal finishing Best of the Rest would be a decent first season for him. And the football has improved. Well, it had to, didn\u2019t it Sam?

      "bodyText": "Claude Puel was supposedly the manager under pressure at Goodison Park yet Leicester City look in rude health in comparison to Everton under Marco Silva. The hosts were booed off following another dreadful display and a fifth defeat in eight games inflicted by Jamie Vardy\u2019s clinical second-half strike. Silva starts the new year in need of new ideas. Read on below \u2026 I\u2019m off now. Thanks for sticking with me, if you did. Football can only get better in 2019. What a strange team Leicester are. In their last five they have lost at Palace and at home against Cardiff and won at Chelsea, at home against Manchester City and away at Everton. Graeme Souness on Sky offers a defence of Puel, who he calls a \u201cfootball man\u201d who doesn\u2019t have \u201cthe waffle and toffee that seems to be around so much these days\u201d. He\u2019s a \u201ccommon-sense football person\u201d, he says. He may have a point. The one thing I would say that probably works against Puel is how quiet he is. I wonder if that\u2019s why Vardy had to run over to the touchline to get instructions off him. Maybe the whispering Frenchman should be given a megaphone to get his in-match tactical tweaks across to his players. Jamie Vardy, the matchwinner, speaks: \u201cI think we needed to put the last performance behind us. To come away in new year and get three points was a great start.\u201d On what he said when he spoke to Puel on the touchline in the first half: \u201cI just asked the manager what was the plan in stopping them in the build up from the back. The boss told me to get some information on to [his teammates] and in the second half we pressed better. Ricky [Ricardo] found me with a great pass and thankfully it went in.\u201d Claude Puel must be mightily relieved to have won that. Even if the owners aren\u2019t happy with him, while Leicester sit in seventh it\u2019s hard for them to sack him. His tactical switch in bringing Albrighton on for Ghezzal helped to win the game. Digne could not get forwards in the second half and Albrighton\u2019s wing play gave Everton\u2019s defence more to think about and afforded Vardy just al little more space. Jonny Evans was a rock at the back too and Ben Chilwell impressed as ever. But Puel\u2019s so lucky to have a striker who is as lethal as Vardy. One half-chance, one goal. Peep! And that\u2019s that. A really poor game is brought to an end. Leicester move up to seventh after a deserved win thanks to an improved second-half performance in which Albrighton helped spark snappier forward play. Everton are booed off. They were awful. They had zero creativity until Bernard came on and Keane\u2019s horrific touch at the back cost them the game. They\u2019re down to 10th and Silva has some thinking to do about how to get his side back on track. 90+2 min: Vardy, who was lethal when it most mattered, is replaced by Gray. 90+1 min: Everton almost score! Bernard whips a great corner in that Keane heads back across goal. Tosun nips in at the back post and heads across Schmeichel, who spreads himself starfish-style, like his dad, to claw the ball away. That\u2019s the first proper save he has had to make. It looks like he\u2019s won the three points for Leicester. 90 min: A dire match will have another three minutes added to it. And Everton have won a corner. Could they? 89 min: Tosun has a speculative shot from the edge of the area blocked and Leicester look like they\u2019e going to go clear in seventh. Unless Everton get the ball to Bernard it\u2019s hard to imagine them creating another chance. 86 min: Bernard dances inside Chilwell brilliantly and drills a low cross into the six-yard box but no Everton player bothers their behind to get on the end of it. The fans in the Gwladys street are up in arms. That was wonderful wing play. 85 min: Kenny wallops a cross into the stands. that kind of sums up Everton\u2019s performance. They\u2019ve been abysmal. Kenny has in fact been one of the few has done OK. 83 min: Chilwell whips in a delicious free-kick to the back post, where Maguire nips in ahead of Zouma and sidefoots over from six yards. That\u2019s a really poor miss. He holds his head in his hands. And that\u2019s no mean feat considering the size of it. 81 min: Tosun clatters Mendy and is booked for his trouble. The free-kick is swung to the backpost by Albrighton (who has impressed since coming on) where Maguire heads the ball on to Keane\u2019s arm. Keane did not handle it intentionally but his arm was in an unnatural position and penalties have been given for less. The irate Leicester fans and Maguire certainly think so. 79 min: Chilwell strides through the Everton defence like a latterday Lothar Mattheus. He almost looks embarrassed to find himself on the edge of the box, from where he hits a tentative right-footed shot straight at Pickford. 77 min: Mendy gets the btter of Bernard in a midfield tussle and pings a diagonal ball towards Albrighton, but Zouma stretches out a long limb to get an important touch on the ball ahead of the Leicester winger, who was waiting to pounce. 75 min: Everton are building a head of steam. Bernard twists inside and out just inside the box and then dinks a ball across to Richarlison, whose shot from 12 yards is blocked. Then Everton gain possession and win a free-kick 25 yards out after a late tackle from Evans for which the defender is booked. Sigurdsson\u2019s free-kick clips the wall, though. That was poor for a player with such an impressive dead-ball game. 72 min: Ricardo Pereira fizzes a cross into teh near-post that causes Pickford all kinds of problems. Whether he was put off by the ball being so close to his near post or not, I\u2019m unsure, but the England goalkeeper should have kept hold of it but instead spilled it to Ndidi. The Leicester midfielder is so close to the byline that he can\u2019t turn and find a teammmate, though. 70 min: Chilwell stretches his legs and skidaddles up the left wing and wins a corner. Albrighton swings it in, but it drifts out of play on the back post before Maguire can head it back into the box. 69 min: Walcott, who has done a great job of hiding in plain sight this afternoon, is replaced by the barrel-chested Cenk Tosun. 68 min: Vardy is becoming a growing threat on the inside-left channel. He has the beating of Keane or Zouma for pace every time the ball is zipped into that channel. As Everton push forwards, they will leave more space in behind for Vardy to exploit. 67 min: It\u2019s wasted by Digne though, slammed into the wall when a cross was the much better option. 64 min: Vardy is wasteful in possession after Leicester broke promisingly. He was trying to find Ricardo Pereira inside him but his pass went awry and almost landed at Albrighton\u2019s feet instead. As it happens, Everton clear. Silva really has to work out what his best defensive line up is. It was three at the back in the past two games with a return to a back four today. This formation has not helped them much defensively nor in an attacking sense. They have a free-kick now 35 yards out on the left in a good position for an inswinging cross. 62 min: Sigurdsson has a pot-shot that is touched over by Schmeichel. Leicester defend the corner well. Evans has marshalled the Leicester defence with authority this afternoon. 61 min: Tom Davies, who was stripped and ready to come on, has been stood down by Silva. Bernard, a zippy attacking player, is now getting ready to come on. He replaces Gomes. So Everton may play with only one holding midfielder instead of two now. 59 min: This is a horrible moment for Keane. Schmeichel clears and the ball is headed back to Keane from Walcott. But Keane\u2019s touch is horrific, bouncing not once, but twice, off the centre-back and landing at Ricardo Pereira\u2019s feet. he plays a first time pass into the channel for Vardy, who beats Zouma in a foot race before drilling a left-footed shot into the corner. A brilliant finish. He\u2019s not had a scrap all afternoon until that chance. A goal. At last! 55 min: Gomes finds Digne again with a lovely, disguised pass. This is a brilliant attempt to stave off a substitution. Digne\u2019s cross is deflected for another corner. Another corner that is cleared, this time by Vardy. 54 min: Gomes, perhaps owing to the knowledge that he is about to be hooked, wins the ball back in midfield like a terrier and finds Digne on the left, who wins a corner. It\u2019s cleared at the near post, though. 53 min: Silva\u2019s had enough already. It looks like Tom Davies is going to come on for Gomes. He should at least raise the tempo in midfield. 51 min: Even the cultured Gomes has caught the bug. He\u2019s booked for hoofing Mendy in the air for no good reason whatsoever. 49 min: Leicester have started the half better than Everton. They work the ball forwards with a series of short, simple accurate passes. Albrighton curls a teasing cross in from the right that Pickford struggles to catch and claws to the back post. Ricardo Pereira picks up possession and is ushered away from goal but his cross back into the box is cleared. 46 min: Thud! Donk! Whack! Clonk! The low winter sun may be one excuse for the inability of players to play a simple pass to a teammate. They are all much better than this. Ndidi is the latest to give the ball away. 45 min: The second half is under way #prayforthesecondhalf Ghezzal, who did the square root of sod all in that half, is replaced by Albrighton. The Everton soundsystem appears to be playing some banging house music. They should leave it on throughout the game. It could help raise the tempo. Some thoughts on a classic half of football at Goodison Vardy had nine touches in that half. I\u2019m surprised it was as many as that. Anyway, here\u2019s an email: \u201cHappy New Year!\u201d whoops Adam Kline-Schoder. \u201cSince nothing much seems to be happening in this \u2018intriguing tactical battle\u2019 besides weak passes being sent generously straight to the opposition, I\u2019ll take the opportunity to ask: if Man City need a defensive midfielder, why aren\u2019t they looking at Gueye? Skilled on the ball, good eye for a pass, positionally disciplined \u2026 his height, maybe? Or perhaps being 29 they don\u2019t see him as a long-term replacement?\u201d Pep being Pep, I suspect he is looking to buy a full-back who he can convert into a holding player. Seriously though, Gueye is good in that role but I think Guardiola would want a defensive midfielder with more variety in his passing. And, as you say, one who may be a year or two younger. I hope this game isn\u2019t an indication of the kind of year we can expect in 2019. I\u2019m getting a tea. I\u2019d get something stronger if I could. Back shortly. 45 min: There will be one minute of added time. Added time that no one wants. Not even the players \u2013 and definitely not the poor fans at Goodison. 43 min: Ricardo Pereira cuts inside Gomes and fires a right-footed shot a yard wide. It was a poor effort but compared to some of the dross that we have seen in this game it was one of the better poor efforts. Everton then break and win a corner after a Walcott cross is deflected wide. Digne curls a testing ball in in and Schmeichel punches clear with authority. 40 min: Vardy pushes Zouma in the back over near the byline and the Everton defender slips and then clatters into the hoardings while conceding a corner. He looks like he\u2019s in trouble but thankfully clambers back to his feet after catching his breath. Ghezzal\u2019s corner is defended well at the near post by Zouma. But the ball lands back at Ghezzal\u2019s feet. He fizzes another cross in that is turned behind for another corner. This one is played in deep, headed back by Vardy to Maguire, who nods a header up into the air towards goal that Pickford collects comfortably. 37 min: Pereira stretches his legs down the left flank. It\u2019s a pacy run but Kenny sticks to his task and concedes a throw. Ghezzal then picks up possession (it may be one of his first touches) and punts the ball into the Gwladys Street end. The top six have nothing to fear from these two on this evidence. 34 min: And now Simpson fouls Richarlison. The Everton forward could put in a bullying claim here. Everton probe around the edge of the Leicester box and get nowhere so Zouma wallops a shot well over from 30 yards. 31 min: Digne\u2019s delivery is fizzed in with rare quality but Calvert-Lewin\u2019s header bounces off the floor and straight into Schmeichel\u2019s hands. 29 min: Choudhury body-checks Richarlison and is booked by Atkinson. This is dire stuff. Free-kick to Everton near the left touchline. 26 min: Simpson steams into Digne and gives a free-kick away. Everton quickly concede possession. Maguire gives the ball away and then Richarlison\u2019s scream can be heard as Evans slides into the Brazilian, winning the ball but following through on the Everton forward, who was side on and left his left leg at the mercy of Evans\u2019s studs. That should have been a yellow card. Maybe Martin Atkinson is as sleepy as the crowd and players. He didn\u2019t even give a free-kick. Thankfully, the magic sponge has worked and Richarlison is able to continue. 25 min: Has there ever been a good early kick-off on new year\u2019s day? And I don\u2019t mean lads going at each other outside pubs. Everton are doing most of the attacking here but most of their attacking involves getting to the edge of the box and giving the ball away. Kenny, the best player on the pitch so far (not saying much), crosses towards the front post,where Calvert-Lewin heads wide from a difficult angle. 22 min: \u201cI know it\u2019s only been 19 minutes, but this is the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen on a football pitch,\u201d writes Rob Edwards. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if both managers are fired before half time and have their coaching badges ripped up by Yorkshire terriers.\u201d 19 min: A chance at last! Kenny cracks a first-time shot at goal almost as fiercely as he contested the tackle with Mendy and watches the ball thud against the right angle of post and crossbar. That\u2019s lifted the home crowd. It was a thunderous hit that came after Leicester failed to clear a routine low cross from the left. 17 min: Kenny thunders into a tackle on Mendy that must leave the Leicester player\u2019s bones rattling. No foul is given. He did win the ball but he also followed through a bit and left Mendy on the deck. He gets back up gingerly. 16 min: A corner for Leicester. A corner that is cleared easily. Deary me. Does nobody want seventh place and A Europa League qualifier? Ah, maybe that answers a few questions. 14 min: \u201cGregg, I\u2019m watching the game with my 10-year-old daughter and we\u2019re having a hard time telling the teams apart. Also, the players keep passing the ball to the other team. She thinks the players can\u2019t tell blue from bluish-gray either \u2026 is our television off or is this a really poor choice of away colours?\u201d Not a great choice of away kit no, but that\u2019s still no excuse for the poor quality of this game. They both look like a pair of teams with actors pretending to be footballers. There are so many mistakes being made. 12 min: Maguire gifts a sloppy pass out of defence to Sigurdsson, mid-way inside the Leicester half. Sigurdsson pounces on it and drills a pass to Richarlison, lingering in the box, but his right-footed shot at goal slams into Evans\u2019s chest and is eventually cleared. 10 min: Vardy smashes a wild shot into space. Not a classic this one. The year 2019 can do much, much better than this. 8 min: Everton have raised the tempo at last. Digne has a couple of plucky runs down the left that cause Leicester some mild concern and then Sigurdsson intends to play Walcott in behind the Liecester defence but it\u2019s overhit and runs through to Schmeichel. 6 min: Gueye fouls Pereira in the middle of the pitch \u2013 and that\u2019s about the most exciting thing that has happened so far. Both teams are moving about like the New Year zombies I saw paroling the streets of Kings Cross at 7.45 this morning. 4 min: \u201cHow would Ben\u00edtez do at a big, league-winning club like Leicester?\u201d asks Rowan Sweeney. \u201cAside from a short (and largely forgettable, Europa League aside) stint at Chelsea he\u2019s an unknown when managing the elite.\u201d I\u2019m guessing this is a joke Rowan but maybe not. Are his two La Liga titles, FA Cup and Champions League asides too? 2 min: It\u2019s quiet at Goodison. An early start on new year\u2019s day isn\u2019t conducive to creating a good atmosphere. Everton have had most of the ball so far but it\u2019s mostly sterile possession in deep areas. 1 min: We\u2019re under way at Goodison. Everton, in royal blue, are shooting from right to left on my screen. Leicester, in their grey away strip, are shooting the other way. There\u2019s a minute\u2019s applause for Evertonians who lost their lives in 2018. It\u2019s a poignant moment for Leicester fans too, who had a traumatic 2018. From what I\u2019ve seen of Andr\u00e9 Gomes this season, he\u2019s a very good player, but there are doubts about how fit he is and how he is coping with the heavy workload of games. If he\u2019s fit I fully expect him to dictate play with Gueye doing the running alongside him as one of two holding players. Getting Gueye fully fit after injury will help Everton\u2019s cause no end too. The two of them seem like a perfectly balanced midfield duo. The theme tune from Z-Cars quivers through the chill early-afternoon air at Goodison, which means the teams are trotting out of the tunnel. We\u2019ll have football soon. Who will win the first Premier League match of 2019? Stay tuned to find out. I wish I could grow hair like Hamza Choudhury. When I was 11 I had a perm. Yes, really. I loved it. Too thin on top these days, alas. There were reports this morning that Rafael Ben\u00edtez is a target for Leicester City. What do you make of that Leicester fans? Rafa has done a great job at Newcastle and is a high-profile manager who has been successful but if Puel\u2019s slower style of football is the problem, Ben\u00edtez\u2019s emphasis on controlling games might not be that different, stylistically. Here\u2019s Everton manager Marco Silva: \u201cI\u2019m always confident in our squad and the work we are doing but there has not been consistency in the last few games. We know the Premier League is tough and new year is very busy. In this moment we have to use rotation. It is impossible if you keep playing the same XI. The players cannot recover in the right way to be 100%. Of course it\u2019s not good to change five, six, seven players [either].\u201d And here\u2019s Leicester\u2019s Whispering Claude Puel on the four changes he\u2019s made: \u201cIt\u2019s to try and keep a good balance. We need to manage the physical condition of the players. Some players can come into the game from the bench.\u201d Thanks Claude. Any new year resolutions, footballing or otherwise? Is that something people still do? I\u2019m not one for denying myself something I enjoy if there\u2019s no good reason. My January won\u2019t be dry. It won\u2019t be soaking wet either. So Everton boss Marco Silva makes three changes to his starting line-up from Saturday\u2019s 1-0 defeat at Brighton. Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Gylfi Sigurdsson and Jonjoe Kenny \u2013 whose last appearance was against the Foxes in early October \u2013 come into the team, with Bernard, Seamus Coleman and Yerry Mina dropping to the bench. Ot looks like Silva is going to line up with a back four, having started with three men in central defence for the last two games. Leicester\u2019s starting XI shows four adjustments from their 1-0 loss to Cardiff as Rachid Ghezzal, Hamza Choudhury, Jonny Evans and Danny Simpson replace Demarai Gray, James Maddison, Marc Albrighton and Caglar Soyuncu. Everton: Pickford, Kenny, Keane, Zouma, Digne, Andr\u00e9 Gomes, Gueye, Walcott, Sigurdsson, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin. Subs: Baines, Mina, Tosun, Bernard, Stekelenburg, Coleman, Davies. Leicester: Schmeichel, Simpson, Maguire, Evans, Chilwell, Mendy, Choudhury, Ndidi, Ricardo Pereira, Vardy, Ghezzal. Subs: Soyuncu, Gray, Maddison, Albrighton, Ward, Okazaki, Fuchs. Referee: Martin Atkinson (Yorkshire of the western variety) Happy new year readers! And what better way to start it than with the salivating prospect of two teams with ambitions to finish seventh going head-to-head at Goodison Park. Both have had topsy-turvy seasons so far. Everton looked like they were making steady progress until the defeat at Liverpool, in which they played well. Following that they have lost four, drawn two and won only once (heavily at Burnley on Boxing Day). They were beaten by Brighton last time out. As for Leicester, the two wondrous results against Chelsea and Manchester City were quickly forgotten at the King Power Stadium as boos rang out following the 1-0 defeat by Cardiff last weekend. Claude Puel still very much looks like a manager expecting the chop even if that is ludicrous given their league position. Leicester\u2019s natural home should be somewhere between 10th and seventh \u2013 so, exactly where they are now. Lifting the club back up to seventh today would surely help his case given that to achieve anything better than that would mean usurping clubs with much greater wealth. The miraculous title win really has skewed expectations at the King Power. Puel is a victim of his own mid-table consistency. The French Curbs? Somebody has to deal with the transition of the title-winning side into regular Premier League mainstays, though. The French Curbs? As for Silva, a win would get disgruntled Toffees back on side, not that his job is under threat, but with the talent he has at his disposal finishing Best of the Rest would be a decent first season for him. And the football has improved. Well, it had to, didn\u2019t it Sam? I\u2019ll be back with team news shortly. My prediction: Everton 2-2 Leicester And here\u2019s some pre-match reading:",

      "bodyText": "It was a softball question at a campaign trail press conference: what would Jair Bolsonaro do on his first day as president? Brazil\u2019s preeminent provocateur wrestled it straight into a Trumpian whirlpool of bluster and barminess. First, Bolsonaro \u2013 then still an outsider in the race for power \u2013 savaged Beijing. \u201cOpen your eyes, because the Chinese are buying Brazil!\u201d he warned the Guardian after the question during a trip to the Amazon last spring. Then, he pondered his own nation, declaring: \u201c[Brazil is like] a patient whose \u2026 whole body needs amputating.\u201d Finally, the far-right firebrand embarked on a jumbled three-minute rollick through issues including Brazilian politics (\u201can embarrassment!\u201d), the country itself (\u201ca load of rubbish!\u201d), English NGOs (\u201ca joke\u201d), Donald Trump (\u201cI\u2019m an admirer\u201d) and Israel (\u201cI\u2019ve been there \u2026 they raise fish in the desert!\u201d) before concluding his harangue with the six-word pledge that would define his insurgent campaign: \u201cWe are going to change Brazil!\u201d It was vintage Bolsonaro: pugnacious, largely nonsensical and yet strangely engrossing \u2013 and perhaps a good guide to how the most unlikely president in Brazilian history will govern for the next four years. Few doubt the far-right populist \u2013 who took power on Tuesday \u2013 is serious about transforming the world\u2019s fourth largest democracy or that his presidency will be an unpredictable and ill-tempered affair. Perhaps no area faces a greater shake-up than the environment. To the horror of the environmentalists he so loathes, Bolsonaro has repeatedly signalled a desire to roll back environmental protections and make it easier to destroy the world\u2019s biggest rainforest. Deeds have accompanied those words. Since his stunning election, Bolsonaro has ditched plans to host key UN climate talks next year and appointed a foreign minister who believes climate change is a Marxist plot. As president, he looks set to take a sledgehammer to Brazil\u2019s hard-earned reputation as a global leader in the fight against climate change and herald a new era of wrecking in the Amazon. Foreign policy will also be upended, as Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil seeks a snug and historic allegiance with Donald Trump\u2019s US and jettisons longstanding friendships with nations ruled by leftists, such as Cuba and Venezuela. \u201cEverything we can legally and democratically do against these countries, we will do,\u201d Bolsonaro recently vowed. Bolsonaro\u2019s English-speaking son, Eduardo, appears poised to play a super-sized role in Brasilia\u2019s pivot to the White House, positioning himself as South American answer to Jared Kushner. Since his father\u2019s election, he has hobnobbed with Ted Cruz and Steve Bannon in the US and repeatedly assailed Venezuela\u2019s \u201cnarco-dictator\u201d president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Expect regional tensions to soar in 2019 as Trump and the Bolsonaros gang up on the disintegrating Bolivarian revolution and Maduro responds in increasingly bellicose fashion. On the domestic front, dramatic changes loom, too, as Bolsonaro \u2013 egged on by the powerful, ultra-conservative evangelists to whom he owes his election \u2013 strives to lead Brazil down a profoundly reactionary path. His decision to name Damares Alves, an anti-abortion evangelical preacher, as head of a new ministry overseeing Brazilian women, families, human rights and indigenous communities is a harbinger of the intolerance and conservatism ahead. The mere prospect of a Bolsonaro presidency has already sent same-sex couples rushing to the altar for fear they might lose such rights once the proud homophobe takes power. With Bolsonaro in office, expect bigotry, hate crime \u2013 and resistance from Brazil\u2019s vibrant civil society \u2013 to increase. Brazil is already one of Latin America\u2019s most violent societies, suffering a record 63,880 homicides in 2017, but under Brazil\u2019s pro-gun president things are almost certain to get worse. Bolsonaro campaigned as a law and order candidate, vowing to use brute force and bullets to slay the drug traffickers behind much of that violence. But he appears to have no real plan to reduce crime beyond fighting violence with violence, and he is almost certain to fail. Instead, by legitimising the police\u2019s use of deadly force, Bolsonaro\u2019s pro-repression rhetoric is likely to accelerate the already rampant killing. Rio de Janeiro, whose newly elected, pro-Bolsonaro governor has called for helicopter-borne snipers to be used to execute rifle-carrying criminals \u2013 is likely to suffer particularly. More than 1,400 people were reportedly gunned down by Rio police in 2018 \u2013 a death every five-and-a-half hours. With Bolsonaro\u2019s blessing, the body count will rise. In the final month before Tuesday\u2019s inauguration, Brazil\u2019s incoming president has hosted weekly Facebook Live broadcasts detailing his controversial and eccentric plans: a crackdown on immigrants who refuse to abandon their own culture and supposedly conspire to marry Brazilian children; a crusade against \u201cunproductive\u201d journalists and leftists who question him; doing away with indigenous reserves because he is convinced Brazil\u2019s tribespeople no longer wish to be stuck \u201cin the Stone Age\u201d. \u201cThe big day is arriving \u2013 1 January!\u201d Bolsonaro beamed in one recent webcast. It is a date millions of progressive Brazilians have viewed with dread.",

Another fan sent him pottery she said Ballerini\u2019s recording had helped her to create. A couple who were stranded by snow for weeks said the My Struggle recordings helped them survive the winter.</p> <p>Some take issue with Ballerini\u2019s description of it as a new art form. The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) has run a a talking books service for more than 80 years.</p> <p>Daryl Chapman, the studios manager at the RNIB, says: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say narration is a new art form, rather one that\u2019s been evolving over time.\u201d</p> <p>Oral storytelling dates back to the earliest days of human language. \u201cCultures often venerated professional story tellers even though they weren\u2019t generating new stories so much as re-telling the old ones,\u201d says Joseph Devlin, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London. </p> <p>Devlin\u2019s research found listening to stories increased people\u2019s emotional engagement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/21/listen-and-weep-audiobooks-outdo-films-in-emotional-engagement\">more than watching video</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI agree with Ballerini that there is an intimacy in the audio format. As a listener you engage more by virtue of co-creating the content with the narrator.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Stokes, the founder of the blog <a href=\"https://audiobookreviewer.com/\">Audiobook Reviewer</a>, says: \u201cIn less than 10 years, the world of audiobooks has exploded. Using smartphones enables listeners, authors, and narrators to connect on many different levels.\u201d</p> <p>He cites the example of <a href=\"http://www.soundbooththeater.com/\">Soundbooth Theatre</a>, which runs live narrations based on YouTube requests, allowing audiences to have a say on how characters are read.</p> <p>Knausgaard approved the casting of Ballerini to read his books, but the two men have never met. \u201cI was afraid meeting the man would shatter some things, and I\u2019ve not even listened to him speak,\u201d Ballerini says.</p> <p>But now that the project is complete, he is keen to meet someone he regards as \u201cthe author I was born to narrate\u201d. Ballerini treasures a signed copy of book three of the series in which Knausgaard describes him as \u201cmy American voice\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/edoballerini/status/1066362961181270017\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Had the thought this was a \u201cbad\u201d year because I missed out on two film projects I wanted.

It was like he was opening a window for me to see my own life. Maybe that\u2019s the case with a lot of people, which is why the books are so compelling.\u201d</p> <p>He says the experience of reading the 3,600 pages aloud was like \u201ca big therapy session\u201d, and admits to dreaming about Knausgaard and incidents in the books.</p> <p>Sarah Shrubb, an audio publisher at Little, Brown Book Group, says narrators often break down in tears reading aloud in the studio, especially when authors are reading their own work.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly difficult and you don\u2019t have the feedback of an audience. It\u2019s just you and the microphone creating these amazing soundscapes in your head. You have to play all of the characters and all their voices, and to be able to do them well is a real art form.\u201d</p> <p>Shrubb says drama schools are beginning to take notice. \u201cIt is becoming an art form that is being taught in colleges. It is not just something actors do between jobs, it\u2019s a career.\u201d</p> <p>Ballerini acknowledges that his view of the status of audiobooks is an unusual one. \u201cTo describe an audiobook as being the largest thing of someone\u2019s career is probably a new kind of claim,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is one that I stand by.\u201d</p>",

The Italian-American actor Edoardo Ballerini has recorded more than 250 titles in an audiobook boom that has seen sales double in five years.

Some take issue with Ballerini\u2019s description of it as a new art form. The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) has run a a talking books service for more than 80 years. Daryl Chapman, the studios manager at the RNIB, says: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say narration is a new art form, rather one that\u2019s been evolving over time.\u201d Oral storytelling dates back to the earliest days of human language. \u201cCultures often venerated professional story tellers even though they weren\u2019t generating new stories so much as re-telling the old ones,\u201d says Joseph Devlin, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London. Devlin\u2019s research found listening to stories increased people\u2019s emotional engagement more than watching video. \u201cI agree with Ballerini that there is an intimacy in the audio format. As a listener you engage more by virtue of co-creating the content with the narrator.\u201d Paul Stokes, the founder of the blog Audiobook Reviewer, says: \u201cIn less than 10 years, the world of audiobooks has exploded. Using smartphones enables listeners, authors, and narrators to connect on many different levels.\u201d He cites the example of Soundbooth Theatre, which runs live narrations based on YouTube requests, allowing audiences to have a say on how characters are read. Knausgaard approved the casting of Ballerini to read his books, but the two men have never met. \u201cI was afraid meeting the man would shatter some things, and I\u2019ve not even listened to him speak,\u201d Ballerini says. But now that the project is complete, he is keen to meet someone he regards as \u201cthe author I was born to narrate\u201d. Ballerini treasures a signed copy of book three of the series in which Knausgaard describes him as \u201cmy American voice\u201d. Ballerini says he sometimes found it difficult to get out of character, when channelling Knausgaard. \u201cI felt like it had gotten under my skin so deeply. It was like he was opening a window for me to see my own life. Maybe that\u2019s the case with a lot of people, which is why the books are so compelling.\u201d He says the experience of reading the 3,600 pages aloud was like \u201ca big therapy session\u201d, and admits to dreaming about Knausgaard and incidents in the books. Sarah Shrubb, an audio publisher at Little, Brown Book Group, says narrators often break down in tears reading aloud in the studio, especially when authors are reading their own work. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly difficult and you don\u2019t have the feedback of an audience. It\u2019s just you and the microphone creating these amazing soundscapes in your head. You have to play all of the characters and all their voices, and to be able to do them well is a real art form.\u201d Shrubb says drama schools are beginning to take notice. \u201cIt is becoming an art form that is being taught in colleges. It is not just something actors do between jobs, it\u2019s a career.\u201d Ballerini acknowledges that his view of the status of audiobooks is an unusual one. \u201cTo describe an audiobook as being the largest thing of someone\u2019s career is probably a new kind of claim,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is one that I stand by.\u201d",

It\u2019s the sort of thing that doesn\u2019t happen in Salisbury; it doesn\u2019t happen anywhere, actually.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no rulebook. You are working in a multilayered, multidisciplinary space, working across government. You\u2019ve got an investigation running, you\u2019ve got a public health process running. We were also dealing with an issue of national security, which is a gamechanger in the way you operate and way you think.\u201d</p> <p>Working closely with Public Health England, one of Daszkiewicz\u2019s key roles was to try to say whether the people of Salisbury were safe. The oft-repeated line was that the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/public-health-england-statement-regarding-events-in-salisbury\">risk to residents was \u201clow\u201d</a>, but this claim was undermined by the sight of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/14/police-five-key-locations-salisbury-in-skripal-attempted-case\">service personnel in hazmat suits</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere was an apparent contradiction between the low-risk message and the hazmat suits,\u201d Daszkiewicz said. The job of public health officials became more difficult when Rowley and Sturgess fell ill. The message that the risk was low no longer seemed convincing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There isn\u2019t widespread anxiety, but there is that constant need for reassurance for answers</p> <footer> <cite>Tracy Daszkiewicz</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t unsay what was said,\u201d Daszkiewicz said. \u201cMessages were given with the best intentions at the time. I didn\u2019t agree with all of them. You have to go out with messages that are as reassuring as possible within the boundaries of truth.\u201d</p> <p>Having learned from the Salisbury attack, the agencies swung into action in Amesbury to explain and reassure. \u201cFor me, the key point was becoming very visible to the Amesbury community as quickly as possible. We had moved into the rounds of a same but different incident. Losing Miss Sturgess is the biggest tragedy in this \u2013 three children have lost their mum,\u201d Daszkiewicz said.</p> <p>Helping the people of Salisbury and Amesbury is a long-term job. \u201cWe usually see patterns of emotional wellbeing changing at about the six-to-eight months mark,\u201d she said. This has happened in Wiltshire, where people are coming forward wanting to talk about what happened.</p> <p>\u201cThere are more conversations now,\u201d Daszkiewicz said. \u201cIt\u2019s not high levels of distress, just conversations, questions. It could be that someone lives close to one of the sites or were working at one of the places that the Skripals visited. There isn\u2019t widespread anxiety, but there is that constant need for reassurance for answers.\u201d Checks will be carried out for at least five years, she added. \u201cSupport systems will need to be in place for as long as it takes. It\u2019s an unknown.\u201d</p> <p>But are Salisbury and Amesbury safe now? \u201cWe\u2019ve worked closely with a range of professionals. I think the people of Salisbury and Amesbury can live their lives safely. What has happened is unprecedented. We\u2019ve lost somebody, it\u2019s incredibly sad. I swing from getting on with it and being incredibly angry at the impact on our community. I\u2019ve seen the impact on people who just want their lives back.

To have the international media, looking at little Salisbury was just so strange. It didn\u2019t occur to us we were in risk or danger, but for the general public it was different.</p> <p>\u201cSome businesses were closed, others were reporting a 40-50% drop in footfall. Visits to the cathedral and other attractions were down. We would have calls from people saying \u2018We\u2019re worried, we\u2019re not coming in\u2019, and we would tell them, \u2018Well, we\u2019re here, we\u2019re not foaming at the mouth\u2019. It was very difficult.</p> <p>\u201cWe battled on. We were just beginning to pick up and put it behind us when Charlie and Dawn fell ill. The consequences for Dawn were horrendous.\u201d</p> <p>Consultants have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/28/salisbury-rebrand-consultants-novichok-poisonings\">brought in to \u201crebrand\u201d Salisbury</a> as it attempts to recover. \u201cYou can\u2019t rename it or anything like that,\u201d Tribbeck said. \u201cBut the idea is to look at what Salisbury is and what Salisbury means \u2013 gathering a picture of where we\u2019re at. It\u2019s about how to communicate what is special about Salisbury, how to conceptualise that and communicate that message to local people and the wider world. That\u2019s what rebranding is about.\u201d</p> <p>Tribbeck was born in Salisbury and began working on Saturdays in the shop when she was 14. \u201cSalisbury is unique. We are a city but we\u2019re small, so we have the friendliness, that nice personal feel. You can walk down the street and people will say hello to you. We call it \u2018Smallsbury\u2019 because everyone knows everyone. There\u2019s an overgrown village feel to it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The suspects probably walked past the shopfront of HR Tribbeck &amp; Son, which was established in 1905 by Rachel\u2019s great grandfather Herbert. \u201cOne of the CCTV images of them was on the bridge just over there. I still have trouble believing it did happen here. It\u2019s like something out of James Bond,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI feel quite cross. I almost feel quite insulted they could come to our city, do something like that and think they could get away with it.

We had our recovery plan in draft by the end of the first week and were sharing it with government the week after.\u201d</p> <p>Cunningham said there was frustration over some of the outlandish stories that emerged in the media. \u201cWe had to bite our lip at some of them and gently bang our heads against a wall. You can\u2019t always put the truth on the table. What we were trying to do was get as much information out to the public as we could. That\u2019s why we <a href=\"http://wiltshire.gov.uk/news/articles/two-community-meetings\">organised all the community meetings</a>,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At those public meetings, people asked how the authorities could be sure they were safe. \u201cI think we were pretty open and honest,\u201d said Cunningham. \u201cWe had to follow the evidence and advice.\u201d The alternative would have been to shut down the city, the county, the ports the novichok may have been moved through.</p> <p>The city is not back to normal yet. By the end of 2018, 1m fewer visits will have been made to Salisbury compared with 2017.

Salisbury was a targeted attack that caused collateral damage to the city. I don\u2019t think anyone thought there would be such a callous disregard from the perpetrators that they would discard their weapon in a public space for someone to find. What they did [to the Skripals] was callous, but to leave the weapon in the city was shocking,\u201d Cunningham said.</p> <p>He paid tribute to the strength of Wiltshire, a county that is proud of its military history, particularly its links to the British army. \u201cThe population is used to the military. We didn\u2019t have that additional factor of people being scared by the sight of troops on the street, which could have been a factor elsewhere,\u201d Cunningham added.</p> <p>A striking aspect of the poisonings has been the dedication of public servants. \u201cWe do these jobs because we believe in public service,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do it for the satisfaction of delivering for the people of Wiltshire.

      "bodyText": "On Sunday 4 March 2018, emergency services were called to what they believed was a straightforward medical incident \u2013 a middle-aged man and a young woman who had been taken ill on a bench in the Maltings shopping centre in Salisbury. It turned out to be anything but routine. The man was the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and the woman was his daughter, Yulia. They were the victims of a nerve agent attack blamed on a Russian hit squad. A police officer, DS Nick Bailey, was also poisoned when he went to search Skripal\u2019s house in Salisbury, and Charlie Rowley and Dawn Sturgess were taken ill at the end of June in the town of Amesbury, eight miles north of Salisbury, when they apparently found a container of the nerve agent novichok disguised as a perfume bottle. Sturgess sprayed some of it on her skin and died. As the area hopes for a simpler 2019, four people reflect on an extraordinary period for Salisbury and Amesbury, and express their hopes for an overdue period of normality and revival. Tracy Daszkiewicz, the director of public health at Wiltshire council In the run-up to the novichok attack, Salisbury had been dealing with a wintry storm known as the beast from the east. \u201cOn the Monday morning [5 March], we had just finished dealing with the snow,\u201d Daszkiewicz said. \u201cWe knew straight away what had happened in Salisbury was unprecedented. It\u2019s the sort of thing that doesn\u2019t happen in Salisbury; it doesn\u2019t happen anywhere, actually. \u201cThere\u2019s no rulebook. You are working in a multilayered, multidisciplinary space, working across government. You\u2019ve got an investigation running, you\u2019ve got a public health process running. We were also dealing with an issue of national security, which is a gamechanger in the way you operate and way you think.\u201d Working closely with Public Health England, one of Daszkiewicz\u2019s key roles was to try to say whether the people of Salisbury were safe. The oft-repeated line was that the risk to residents was \u201clow\u201d, but this claim was undermined by the sight of service personnel in hazmat suits. \u201cThere was an apparent contradiction between the low-risk message and the hazmat suits,\u201d Daszkiewicz said. The job of public health officials became more difficult when Rowley and Sturgess fell ill. The message that the risk was low no longer seemed convincing. \u201cYou can\u2019t unsay what was said,\u201d Daszkiewicz said. \u201cMessages were given with the best intentions at the time. I didn\u2019t agree with all of them. You have to go out with messages that are as reassuring as possible within the boundaries of truth.\u201d Having learned from the Salisbury attack, the agencies swung into action in Amesbury to explain and reassure. \u201cFor me, the key point was becoming very visible to the Amesbury community as quickly as possible. We had moved into the rounds of a same but different incident. Losing Miss Sturgess is the biggest tragedy in this \u2013 three children have lost their mum,\u201d Daszkiewicz said. Helping the people of Salisbury and Amesbury is a long-term job. \u201cWe usually see patterns of emotional wellbeing changing at about the six-to-eight months mark,\u201d she said. This has happened in Wiltshire, where people are coming forward wanting to talk about what happened. \u201cThere are more conversations now,\u201d Daszkiewicz said. \u201cIt\u2019s not high levels of distress, just conversations, questions. It could be that someone lives close to one of the sites or were working at one of the places that the Skripals visited. There isn\u2019t widespread anxiety, but there is that constant need for reassurance for answers.\u201d Checks will be carried out for at least five years, she added. \u201cSupport systems will need to be in place for as long as it takes. It\u2019s an unknown.\u201d But are Salisbury and Amesbury safe now? \u201cWe\u2019ve worked closely with a range of professionals. I think the people of Salisbury and Amesbury can live their lives safely. What has happened is unprecedented. We\u2019ve lost somebody, it\u2019s incredibly sad. I swing from getting on with it and being incredibly angry at the impact on our community. I\u2019ve seen the impact on people who just want their lives back. There\u2019s something nice about normal and ordinary. I see it as my job to give them back that. Rachel Tribbeck, a partner at the Salisbury jewellers HR Tribbeck &amp; Son Shop owners tried to carry on regardless in the days after the attack. \u201cTo begin with, we didn\u2019t realise the magnitude of what had happened,\u201d Tribbeck said. \u201cLife carried on as normal, but then it kept gathering momentum. To have the international media, looking at little Salisbury was just so strange. It didn\u2019t occur to us we were in risk or danger, but for the general public it was different. \u201cSome businesses were closed, others were reporting a 40-50% drop in footfall. Visits to the cathedral and other attractions were down. We would have calls from people saying \u2018We\u2019re worried, we\u2019re not coming in\u2019, and we would tell them, \u2018Well, we\u2019re here, we\u2019re not foaming at the mouth\u2019. It was very difficult. \u201cWe battled on. We were just beginning to pick up and put it behind us when Charlie and Dawn fell ill. The consequences for Dawn were horrendous.\u201d Consultants have been brought in to \u201crebrand\u201d Salisbury as it attempts to recover. \u201cYou can\u2019t rename it or anything like that,\u201d Tribbeck said. \u201cBut the idea is to look at what Salisbury is and what Salisbury means \u2013 gathering a picture of where we\u2019re at. It\u2019s about how to communicate what is special about Salisbury, how to conceptualise that and communicate that message to local people and the wider world. That\u2019s what rebranding is about.\u201d Tribbeck was born in Salisbury and began working on Saturdays in the shop when she was 14. \u201cSalisbury is unique. We are a city but we\u2019re small, so we have the friendliness, that nice personal feel. You can walk down the street and people will say hello to you. We call it \u2018Smallsbury\u2019 because everyone knows everyone. There\u2019s an overgrown village feel to it,\u201d she said. The suspects probably walked past the shopfront of HR Tribbeck &amp; Son, which was established in 1905 by Rachel\u2019s great grandfather Herbert. \u201cOne of the CCTV images of them was on the bridge just over there. I still have trouble believing it did happen here. It\u2019s like something out of James Bond,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel quite cross. I almost feel quite insulted they could come to our city, do something like that and think they could get away with it. What makes me really angry is the way they discarded this perfume bottle for someone else to pick up. That showed a complete lack of any humanity.\u201d Alistair Cunningham, the chairman of the South Wiltshire recovery coordination group Within days of the attack, planning for recovery began. \u201cWe\u2019d been dealing with the beast from the east,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cThe snow went away, we felt we\u2019ve done well and straight into this. \u201cFrom the first week, we were looking at recovery.

Not only the conflict in Syria but also ongoing persecution in countries such as Sudan, Eritrea and Afghanistan has prompted record numbers of refugees to flee for their lives.</p> <p>To put the hundred or so refugees reported to have crossed the Channel to the UK since Christmas Day into perspective: in 2015 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-44660699\" title=\"\">1,015,078 refugees</a> arrived in Europe, more than 800,000 trafficked by sea from Turkey to Greece. Since then the numbers reaching Europe have plummeted. From the beginning of this year until mid\u2011September <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-44660699\" title=\"\">20,120 arrived in Italy</a>, down from 180,000 in 2016 and 20,760 arrived in Greece.</p> <p>The number of clandestine <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/migrants-channel-refugees-crossing-uk-boats-home-office-asylum-seekers-a8704351.html\" title=\"\">arrivals at UK southern coastal ports</a> in 2017-18 was 1,832, a 23% decrease on the 2,366 of these arrivals the previous year.</p> <p>Rather than hand-wringing about the latest refugee attempts to reach safety, Javid et al should be congratulating themselves on how effectively they have reduced migration to Europe.</p> <p>The government is right that there has been a (small) spike in Channel crossings in the past few days but this is likely to be a result of our effective policy to hermetically seal the previous lorry and train routes in Calais that refugees were using without attracting daily headlines.</p> <p>In the UK the <a href=\"https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN01403\" title=\"\">numbers claiming asylum</a> have gone down dramatically from a high of 84,132 in 2002. In 2015 there were 32,733 claims. The third quarter of 2018 reveals 7,444 claims. Whatever the fourth-quarter statistics will show when they are published early this year, those claiming asylum by crossing the Channel are likely to be a small percentage of the overall stats.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is easy for these politicians to condemn the gangs of traffickers cashing in on human misery.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But this is so much more than a numbers game. The collapse in the number of refugees reaching Europe is certainly not due to a resolution of conflicts in global trouble spots leading to more people happily staying at home. It is due to a deliberate raft of policies promulgated by EU countries, including the UK, to shore up Fortress Europe. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/08/eu-turkey-refugee-deal-qa\" title=\"\">deal signed between the European Union and Turkey</a> in March 2016 specified that everyone who arrived in Greece from Turkey must claim asylum on arrival. Those who didn\u2019t or whose asylum claims were rejected were sent back to Turkey. To address the exodus from countries such as Eritrea and Sudan, the <a href=\"https://www.khartoumprocess.net/about/the-khartoum-process\" title=\"\">Khartoum Process</a> was established \u2013 political cooperation among countries along the migration route between the Horn of Africa and Europe. The <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/regions/africa/eu-emergency-trust-fund-africa_en\" title=\"\">EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa</a> claims to promote stability and address the root causes of irregular migration. All of these initiatives can be summarised simply with the words push back.</p> <p>Europe does not want these refugees. It doesn\u2019t matter how \u201cdeserving\u201d they are and whether or not they qualify for our protection under the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.33_GC-IV-EN.pdf\" title=\"\">Geneva convention</a>. Doing the decent human thing and offering sanctuary to those fleeing persecution in Syria, Eritrea, Sudan and Afghanistan does not play out well politically at home. Some of those pushed back can go home without risking their lives. But many cannot. Eritrea \u2013 described as Africa\u2019s North Korea, where indefinite military service is mandatory and where Pentecostal Christians cannot practise their religion \u2013 will not accept forced returnees. Thanks to push back, many refugees from Eritrea and other conflict zones are now holed up in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/20/child-refugees-facing-abuse-in-libyan-detention-centres\" title=\"\">horrendous detention centres in Libya</a>, to which the UK contributes funds.

      "bodyText": "The \u201cmajor incident\u201d is well and truly under way. Sajid Javid has signalled just how seriously he is taking the recent spike in refugee crossings across the Channel by interrupting his holiday to deal with the crisis. All manner of plans are now being devised to shore up our borders. Around 100 people have crossed the Channel since Christmas Day but while the government ramps up concern about this sudden \u201cnew\u201d development \u2013 actually something that has been occurring since 2017 \u2013 context is lacking. The past few years has seen the worst refugee crisis since the second world war. Not only the conflict in Syria but also ongoing persecution in countries such as Sudan, Eritrea and Afghanistan has prompted record numbers of refugees to flee for their lives. To put the hundred or so refugees reported to have crossed the Channel to the UK since Christmas Day into perspective: in 2015 1,015,078 refugees arrived in Europe, more than 800,000 trafficked by sea from Turkey to Greece. Since then the numbers reaching Europe have plummeted. From the beginning of this year until mid\u2011September 20,120 arrived in Italy, down from 180,000 in 2016 and 20,760 arrived in Greece. The number of clandestine arrivals at UK southern coastal ports in 2017-18 was 1,832, a 23% decrease on the 2,366 of these arrivals the previous year. Rather than hand-wringing about the latest refugee attempts to reach safety, Javid et al should be congratulating themselves on how effectively they have reduced migration to Europe. The government is right that there has been a (small) spike in Channel crossings in the past few days but this is likely to be a result of our effective policy to hermetically seal the previous lorry and train routes in Calais that refugees were using without attracting daily headlines. In the UK the numbers claiming asylum have gone down dramatically from a high of 84,132 in 2002. In 2015 there were 32,733 claims. The third quarter of 2018 reveals 7,444 claims. Whatever the fourth-quarter statistics will show when they are published early this year, those claiming asylum by crossing the Channel are likely to be a small percentage of the overall stats. But this is so much more than a numbers game. The collapse in the number of refugees reaching Europe is certainly not due to a resolution of conflicts in global trouble spots leading to more people happily staying at home. It is due to a deliberate raft of policies promulgated by EU countries, including the UK, to shore up Fortress Europe. A deal signed between the European Union and Turkey in March 2016 specified that everyone who arrived in Greece from Turkey must claim asylum on arrival. Those who didn\u2019t or whose asylum claims were rejected were sent back to Turkey. To address the exodus from countries such as Eritrea and Sudan, the Khartoum Process was established \u2013 political cooperation among countries along the migration route between the Horn of Africa and Europe. The EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa claims to promote stability and address the root causes of irregular migration. All of these initiatives can be summarised simply with the words push back. Europe does not want these refugees. It doesn\u2019t matter how \u201cdeserving\u201d they are and whether or not they qualify for our protection under the Geneva convention. Doing the decent human thing and offering sanctuary to those fleeing persecution in Syria, Eritrea, Sudan and Afghanistan does not play out well politically at home. Some of those pushed back can go home without risking their lives. But many cannot. Eritrea \u2013 described as Africa\u2019s North Korea, where indefinite military service is mandatory and where Pentecostal Christians cannot practise their religion \u2013 will not accept forced returnees. Thanks to push back, many refugees from Eritrea and other conflict zones are now holed up in horrendous detention centres in Libya, to which the UK contributes funds. They cannot go back nor can they move forward. Some are dying unrecorded in these hellholes \u2013 those who continue to live are suffering beyond measure. But our politicians are refusing to answer questions about their fate honestly. There are hollow words and crocodile tears about the dangers of refugees risking their lives making hazardous sea crossings, yet our politicians have declined to offer them a safe alternative. This is the real crisis, not the hundred people who have crossed the Channel in the past few days. It is easy for these politicians to condemn the gangs of traffickers cashing in on human misery. But our governments could put these gangs out of business and alleviate the mass of human suffering by opening up legal routes to sanctuary, shared fairly across every EU country.

      "body": "<p>I\u2019ve been running for about five years. I started because I wanted to get fitter and I carried on because it worked. When you\u2019re in your 50s, with a job that is mostly sitting on your arse, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/30/there-is-a-thrill-to-seeing-your-stomach-getting-flatter-why-i-run\" title=\"\">you have to do <em>something</em></a>.</p> <p>Running suits my lifestyle. I live in London, about 14km (nine miles) from work, so when I\u2019m feeling energetic I can run all the way there in about 1hr 20min. The city being what it is, I couldn\u2019t get there much faster by public transport. Other days, I can squeeze six or seven kilometres into my lunchbreak. In a good week, I can notch up 40km without totally neglecting my wife, stepkids, cat and dog.</p> <p>But lately I\u2019ve been having doubts. One of the nicest things about doing a sport \u2013 for me, at least \u2013 is the knowledge that you\u2019re getting better: that you\u2019re running faster, or longer, or more elegantly. I\u2019m not. Too many outings are just a little bit slower than the one before. I\u2019ve got in the habit of signing up for races and then not turning up since I know I\u2019ll disappoint myself.</p> <p>Which is why, one chilly October morning, I find myself on an appallingly steep hill, running up and down it as fast as I can before the sun is up. It\u2019s why, on another pre-dawn morning, I am in a deserted park, sprinting and resting, sprinting and resting until I think my lungs will burst. And it\u2019s why, for the first time in my life, I buy a barbell and start watching weightlifting videos.</p> <p>There\u2019s a plan to all this and it comes from Jenny Tomei, the personal trainer I\u2019ve asked to get me out of my rut. A keen runner herself, Jenny has spent more than an hour quizzing me about how I eat (OK), how much I sleep (not nearly enough) and how much I drink (the less said, the better), as well as how much and how fast I run, how I warm up and what other exercise I take. She has also watched me run, so she can look at my technique. Apparently, although it\u2019s OK to kick up my heels as high I do \u2013 Mo Farah does it \u2013 I shouldn\u2019t bounce quite so much.</p> <p>Together we come up with a tough but achievable target: that in two months I will run my fastest-ever 16km. It\u2019s a goal that appeals because as well as being a classic distance in its own right \u2013 10 miles in old money \u2013 it\u2019s a bit more than my usual long runs. After that, I tell myself, going back to 14km will be a doddle. And all I will have to do is put myself through hell for eight weeks.</p> <p>I exaggerate. Jenny doesn\u2019t ask me to do anything I can\u2019t, but she does push me harder than I would have pushed myself. Which, I suppose, is the point.</p> <p>My new schedule features runs of 10-15km on Monday and Friday, separated by two much shorter outings that emphasise hill climbs and sprints. To stop me getting bored over the weekends, there\u2019s that weightlifting: 50 <a href=\"https://www.coachmag.co.uk/exercises/leg-exercises/3720/romanian-deadlifts-unlock-your-leg-muscles\" title=\"\">Romanian deadlifts</a>, which involve raising a 60kg barbell, straight-legged, from my shins to mid-thigh. This should do wonders for my hamstrings, glutes, lower back and hips.</p> <p>There\u2019s a lot I don\u2019t like the sound of \u2013 but that has been true of every running plan I\u2019ve tried to follow. Infuriatingly, most experts insist that if you want to get faster over long distances you must first get faster over short distances. In other words, you have to do a lot of sprinting \u2013 even if, like me, you hate it \u2013 or mix it with slower running in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2015/jun/09/fartlek-swedens-gift-to-running\" title=\"\">what\u2019s known as fartlek</a>. Jenny\u2019s plan has plenty of this, too, but this time I\u2019m determined to follow the plan properly, rather than ignore the bits I don\u2019t like.</p> <p>What I do like about this plan is that it has been built for me. Like all running programmes, it starts gently then ramps up, with the longer outings getting longer and faster, and the shorter ones featuring more sprinting and less resting. But having two long runs during the week is a big deviation from the standard routine of one long one on a Saturday or Sunday. It\u2019s a great fit with my combination of chronic insomnia and runnable commute. That\u2019s something you don\u2019t get off the peg.</p> <p>My motto for the next few months comes from Nietzsche: what does not kill us makes us stronger. Although I\u2019ll never enjoy sprinting, which is why I haven\u2019t done it since school, I discover I can do it, and it has the great virtue of being over quickly. When I mention this to Jenny, she cuts the recovery time I\u2019m allowed between sprints. I\u2019m happy with this. If I have to be out in the cold and dark, I would rather be running than just standing there and shiver-sweating.</p> <p>There\u2019s another thing I like about Jenny\u2019s plan: she wants me to eat more. Although I could do with losing a few kilos (see photos), she doesn\u2019t approve of my habit of running on an empty stomach. Even first thing in the morning, she says, I need something light and easily digested.</p> <p>I\u2019m not entirely convinced, as eating shortly before exercise makes me worry about <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1488162/Well-Paula-thats-one-way-to-stop-them-talking-about-Athens.html\" title=\"\">coming over all Paula Radcliffe</a>, but on the mornings I\u2019m running I cram in a porridge bar or a piece of toast and peanut butter the minute I\u2019m up. It works: my long runs seem easier than they used to, presumably because I have some fuel for my muscles. And though I struggle with my speed, it\u2019s not because I\u2019m too slow.</p> <p>My target pace \u2013 which we call the \u201crace pace\u201d, though the only person I\u2019ll be competing with is my old, slow self \u2013 is about 5min 10sec a kilometre, which would not be fast for many seasoned runners. It\u2019s about 20sec quicker than my previous best over the same distance<strong><em>.</em></strong></p> <p>Perhaps because of all the sprinting \u2013 when I go flat out, with no attempt to keep anything in reserve \u2013 I keep running too fast, however much I try to slow down. Soon I am averaging 5min 9sec on the long runs, then 5min 3sec and 5min 2sec. These aren\u2019t the full 16km, and I usually feel close to collapse by the end, but I am confident that once I learn to pace myself, I will hit that 5min 10sec target for the full 16km, and probably beat it.</p> <p>And then it all goes bosoms-up. Three weeks before race day, I get a sharp pain in my groin. I cut that run short, have a few days off, think things are getting better \u2026 and then, as I\u2019m starting another set of sprints, I get that stabbing pain again. It\u2019s there whenever I lift my knee high \u2013 not just when I\u2019m running, but also when I\u2019m stepping in and out of my pants.</p> <p>A physio tells me I\u2019ve injured my hip flexors, high up in the inner thigh, then gives me a painful massage and prescribes a lot of stretches and exercises that will eventually correct the problem and make me less injury-prone.</p> <p>But that\u2019s for the long term. In the meantime, that 16km race is not going to happen. When this sinks in, I spend several hours feeling angry, frustrated and sorry for myself.</p> <p>Then I pull myself together. This setback is annoying, but that\u2019s all. It\u2019s not the first injury I\u2019ve had, and this training has shown me that, no, I\u2019m not doomed to get slower and slower \u2013 at least not just yet.</p> <p>I sign up for a half-marathon in the spring, by which time I plan to be fully healed and race-ready. And I text Jenny: \u201cI need you to do me another plan \u2026\u201d</p> <p><em>Jenny Tomei is at </em><a href=\"https://www.jennytomei.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>jennytomei.co.uk</em></a></p>",

The programme of sponsoring catwalks for emerging designers, along with the lavish champagne-soaked hospitality that became a symbol of Green\u2019s status, was already being pegged back by the beginning of this year.</p> <p>While few tears have been shed for Green, the decline of Topshop illustrates another shift in fashion: the end of a golden age of the high street. From the early 00s to the beginning of this decade, Topshop was the poster child for a fashion culture in which glamour and newness were democratised and made available to shoppers on a mass budget for the first time. Catwalk images had previously been a closely guarded secret in the months during which clothes shown at fashion week went into production, which meant high street retailers operated on a six-month time lag, unable to begin work on high street versions of the \u201cnew look\u201d until the designer clothes went on sale.</p> <p>The internet changed all that. Images became immediately available, enabling savvy high street teams to interpret the trends and deliver them to suit their customers just as fast as Bond Street. Topshop \u2013 thanks to a talented and largely female team led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/31/former-senior-executive-alleges-sir-philip-green-was-a-bully\">Jane Shepherdson</a> \u2013 exploited this opportunity better than anyone else, delivering up to the minute, well-priced fashion.</p> <p>Green\u2019s heavily stage-managed front row photo opportunities signified more than just the roarings of his rampant ego. Having Vogue cover girls attend a Topshop fashion show reflected a time when fashion\u2019s class system appeared to have melted away.</p> <p>It was not to last. The latest hemlines, as decreed by the most chic designers in Paris or the colour-dominating catwalks in Milan, had once been thrilling plot twists that kept fashion customers hooked. Now that all of fashion\u2019s secrets were out in the open, these plot twists \u2013 otherwise known as trends \u2013 lost their power over women\u2019s shopping habits.</p> <p>Topshop\u2019s cachet had been based on being the closest a high street shopper could get to catwalk fashion. But in making it accessible to all, Topshop helped devalue the currency of biannual trends, and the audience ebbed away to find excitement elsewhere \u2013 in street style, streetwear, or Instagram, in a new generation of social media-oriented brands.</p> <p>At the same time, a growing awareness of the conditions of workers producing fast fashion and of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jun/24/ten-ways-to-make-fashion-greener\">environmental impact of throwaway styles</a> dimmed the lustre of fashion as a playground for all. The current crisis has been brought about by a man of whom few are fond, but in its pomp Topshop was a shop millions of women adored.</p>",

Catwalk images had previously been a closely guarded secret in the months during which clothes shown at fashion week went into production, which meant high street retailers operated on a six-month time lag, unable to begin work on high street versions of the \u201cnew look\u201d until the designer clothes went on sale. The internet changed all that. Images became immediately available, enabling savvy high street teams to interpret the trends and deliver them to suit their customers just as fast as Bond Street. Topshop \u2013 thanks to a talented and largely female team led by Jane Shepherdson \u2013 exploited this opportunity better than anyone else, delivering up to the minute, well-priced fashion. Green\u2019s heavily stage-managed front row photo opportunities signified more than just the roarings of his rampant ego. Having Vogue cover girls attend a Topshop fashion show reflected a time when fashion\u2019s class system appeared to have melted away. It was not to last. The latest hemlines, as decreed by the most chic designers in Paris or the colour-dominating catwalks in Milan, had once been thrilling plot twists that kept fashion customers hooked. Now that all of fashion\u2019s secrets were out in the open, these plot twists \u2013 otherwise known as trends \u2013 lost their power over women\u2019s shopping habits. Topshop\u2019s cachet had been based on being the closest a high street shopper could get to catwalk fashion. But in making it accessible to all, Topshop helped devalue the currency of biannual trends, and the audience ebbed away to find excitement elsewhere \u2013 in street style, streetwear, or Instagram, in a new generation of social media-oriented brands. At the same time, a growing awareness of the conditions of workers producing fast fashion and of the environmental impact of throwaway styles dimmed the lustre of fashion as a playground for all. The current crisis has been brought about by a man of whom few are fond, but in its pomp Topshop was a shop millions of women adored.",

His innocence is undoubted and we trust that his rights will be respected.\u201d</p> <p>A BorgWarner representative confirmed that Whelan was employed as the company\u2019s global security director, responsible for overseeing security at the company\u2019s facilities in Michigan and \u201cother company locations around the world\u201d.</p> <p>It is not clear whether any US officials have seen Whelan since his arrest. The family said they had been in contact with their congressional representatives, the US embassy and the state epartment, where many officials were on furlough due to the US government shutdown.</p> <p>The family said they believed a 72-hour window for the US government to be able to visit Whelan had already started and they had not been in contact with anyone who had seen or been in contact with Whelan since 5pm (Moscow time) on 28 December.</p> <p>\u201cWe are hoping he will be able to return home soon,\u201d the family said.</p> <p>The wedding party had been staying at the Metropol hotel in Moscow.</p> <p>Whelan\u2019s arrest came just weeks after a Russian national <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/10/maria-butina-russian-agent-nra-kremlin-infiltrate-plead-guilty\">named Maria Butina</a> pleaded guilty to secretly acting as a Russian agent in the US.

      "bodyText": "The American man who was detained in Russia on accusations of being a spy is a retired marine who was visiting Moscow to attend a wedding, according to his family. In a statement released on Tuesday morning, the family of Paul Whelan said the last time anyone had contact with him was on 28 December, the night before the wedding he was due to attend. Russia\u2019s domestic security service announced on Monday that it had arrested an American on Friday who was \u201ccarrying out an act of espionage\u201d. A statement in Russian did not provide further details about the individual who was detained or information about the alleged spying, but his name appeared to transliterate as Paul Whelan. The US state department declined to comment on whether the detained individual was a former marine, but in response to a question from the Guardian it said it was aware that a US citizen had been detained, had been notified of his detention by the Russian ministry of foreign affairs, and said it was seeking access to the individual. \u201cDue to privacy considerations, we have no additional information to provide at this time,\u201d the department said. In an email to the Guardian, Whelan\u2019s twin brother, David, said Whelan was attending the wedding of a fellow former marine, who was marrying a Russian woman. Whelan\u2019s family said he had been to Russia \u201cnumerous times\u201d, as far back as 2007, and was currently working on a corporate security team for BorgWarner, which is listed online as a Michigan-based maker of automative industry components. David Whelan said his brother had previously been to Russia as a visitor and for his work for Kelly Services, a management consultancy. The Guardian could not immediately verify the accuracy of the family\u2019s statement. Whelan\u2019s previous trips to Russia, his brother said, were only for short visits and he had limited Russian language abilities \u201cother than to be able to get around\u201d. \u201cThis visit was entirely for pleasure, from what I understand,\u201d his brother said. The family said they had learned of Whelan\u2019s arrest on Monday after reading the news reports. \u201cWe noticed that he was not in communication on the 28th, which was very much out of character for him even when he was traveling,\u201d the family said. \u201cWe are deeply concerned for his safety and wellbeing. His innocence is undoubted and we trust that his rights will be respected.\u201d A BorgWarner representative confirmed that Whelan was employed as the company\u2019s global security director, responsible for overseeing security at the company\u2019s facilities in Michigan and \u201cother company locations around the world\u201d. It is not clear whether any US officials have seen Whelan since his arrest. The family said they had been in contact with their congressional representatives, the US embassy and the state epartment, where many officials were on furlough due to the US government shutdown. The family said they believed a 72-hour window for the US government to be able to visit Whelan had already started and they had not been in contact with anyone who had seen or been in contact with Whelan since 5pm (Moscow time) on 28 December. \u201cWe are hoping he will be able to return home soon,\u201d the family said. The wedding party had been staying at the Metropol hotel in Moscow. Whelan\u2019s arrest came just weeks after a Russian national named Maria Butina pleaded guilty to secretly acting as a Russian agent in the US. It is not clear whether Whelan\u2019s detention was an attempt to retaliate for Butina\u2019s arrest, which is a sore point in US-Russian relations.",

What it looked like was a guy in his 60s with a woman of similar age and another guy all dressed in black. \u201cIt looked like they were having a fight, but she was screaming in this blood-curdling way. I saw police in hi-vis come towards him. He came towards me. I looked down and saw he had a kitchen knife with a black handle with a good 12-inch blade. It was just fear, pure fear.\u201d Clack claimed he heard the man shouting \u201cAllah\u201d during the attack. \u201cHe shouted it before, he shouted it during it \u2013 Allah. The guy, his exact words were, he said: \u2018As long as you keep bombing other countries, this sort of shit is going to keep happening.\u2019\u201d He said police used a stun gun and pepper spray on the man before several officers jumped on him. \u201cIt was scary. I have never been so scared in my life. Someone with a knife six to eight feet away, he had just stabbed someone. It was the proximity. It just highlights the fact that it can happen anywhere.\u201d The North West ambulance service said it sent three vehicles to the incident and took all three victims to hospital for treatment. While the station was closed after the attack, the city\u2019s fireworks display in Albert Square went ahead after security was increased. There have been no major terrorist attacks in the UK for the past year but MI5 and the police say they are dealing with 700 investigations into suspected terrorism. In 2017, there were five terrorist attacks \u2013 four in London and one in Manchester. The terrorism threat level for the UK remains at severe, meaning an attack is deemed to be highly likely.",

      "body": "<p>It was a coincidence that the MCC scheduled its winter 1918 committee meeting on 12 November, though if pressed Lord Hawke might have professed it presentiment and canny planning. Either way, on the very first day after the armistice, the MCC\u2019s ordinary committee got together to get on with the business of organising the next domestic schedule. They had a lot to talk about. Through four years of war, there had been no county cricket at all. Now it was back, no one seemed to agree exactly what it should be. Opinion was split. On the one side were the reactionaries, on the other, the reformists.</p> <p>Which is a row that seems to have been around as long as the game itself. The old joke is that the English invented cricket to give themselves some conception of eternity, but really they did it so they\u2019d have something to bicker about during it. There\u2019s always talk that something must be done. And occasionally something actually is, something more than the constant tinkering and tampering with schedules and formats that means no two seasons ever seem to be quite alike, something significant, like the launch of the Sunday league or the T20 trophy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/27/england-world-cup-ashes-cricket-uncertain-2020\">Thrilling England must captivate nation before cricket\u2019s uncertain 2020</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 1919, the Bolsheviks wanted to enlarge the stumps, extend the overs, and expand the playing hours, to cover the pitches, cut the matches, shrink the bats, reduce the playing days, and limit the number of professional players. Someone even suggested they ban all the left-handed batsmen, just to save the minutes wasted changing the field over. A century before Twenty20, the Observer argued the MCC should organise three-hour county matches, because \u201cthe normal attendances on the county cricket grounds would be doubled after the tea interval if spectators were assured 90 minutes of healthy hitting\u201d.</p> <p>The MCC did what any good English institution would in such circumstances, and set up yet another committee to investigate. It was a stormy winter, with much frothing, seething and spluttering. At the national papers, over-worked letters editors must have consoled themselves with dreams of what they might buy with all the overtime they were earning. Eventually, the pronouncement came down that all matches would now last two days rather than three, and that playing hours would be stretched till 7.30pm, \u201cto give workers an opportunity of seeing more of the game\u201d. Everything else would remain the same, except for tea, which, in the most drastic step yet, would now be taken on the field \u201cto save time\u201d.</p> <p>So 1919 was one of the great revolutionary seasons in the history of English cricket. And now, 100 years later, we\u2019re about to have another. Two, in fact, back-to-back. This time, the outbreak of reformist zeal is an overdue attempt to blow the game out the doldrums its been in for the last decade, when participation has dropped, and public enthusiasm dwindled. The remedies the ECB has come up with now are even more radical than the MCC\u2019s 1919 plan to speed up the tea break.</p> <p>Between this April and September 2020, there will be a World Cup and the Ashes, as well as an overhaul of the county championship, and the launch of a new format, The Hundred. There can\u2019t have been a run of summers quite like it.</p> <p>The ECB has been building towards these two seasons for the last four years.

      "bodyText": "It was a coincidence that the MCC scheduled its winter 1918 committee meeting on 12 November, though if pressed Lord Hawke might have professed it presentiment and canny planning. Either way, on the very first day after the armistice, the MCC\u2019s ordinary committee got together to get on with the business of organising the next domestic schedule. They had a lot to talk about. Through four years of war, there had been no county cricket at all. Now it was back, no one seemed to agree exactly what it should be. Opinion was split. On the one side were the reactionaries, on the other, the reformists. Which is a row that seems to have been around as long as the game itself. The old joke is that the English invented cricket to give themselves some conception of eternity, but really they did it so they\u2019d have something to bicker about during it. There\u2019s always talk that something must be done. And occasionally something actually is, something more than the constant tinkering and tampering with schedules and formats that means no two seasons ever seem to be quite alike, something significant, like the launch of the Sunday league or the T20 trophy. In 1919, the Bolsheviks wanted to enlarge the stumps, extend the overs, and expand the playing hours, to cover the pitches, cut the matches, shrink the bats, reduce the playing days, and limit the number of professional players. Someone even suggested they ban all the left-handed batsmen, just to save the minutes wasted changing the field over. A century before Twenty20, the Observer argued the MCC should organise three-hour county matches, because \u201cthe normal attendances on the county cricket grounds would be doubled after the tea interval if spectators were assured 90 minutes of healthy hitting\u201d. The MCC did what any good English institution would in such circumstances, and set up yet another committee to investigate. It was a stormy winter, with much frothing, seething and spluttering. At the national papers, over-worked letters editors must have consoled themselves with dreams of what they might buy with all the overtime they were earning. Eventually, the pronouncement came down that all matches would now last two days rather than three, and that playing hours would be stretched till 7.30pm, \u201cto give workers an opportunity of seeing more of the game\u201d. Everything else would remain the same, except for tea, which, in the most drastic step yet, would now be taken on the field \u201cto save time\u201d. So 1919 was one of the great revolutionary seasons in the history of English cricket. And now, 100 years later, we\u2019re about to have another. Two, in fact, back-to-back. This time, the outbreak of reformist zeal is an overdue attempt to blow the game out the doldrums its been in for the last decade, when participation has dropped, and public enthusiasm dwindled. The remedies the ECB has come up with now are even more radical than the MCC\u2019s 1919 plan to speed up the tea break. Between this April and September 2020, there will be a World Cup and the Ashes, as well as an overhaul of the county championship, and the launch of a new format, The Hundred. There can\u2019t have been a run of summers quite like it. The ECB has been building towards these two seasons for the last four years. It\u2019s restructured the central contract system to make sure limited-overs players were earning as much, or more, as Test match specialists, and encouraged players to prioritise the IPL. They hired Trevor Bayliss, because, as their old director of cricket Andrew Strauss said over and again back then, he was such a good limited-overs coach. And it\u2019s stuck with him since, even while the Test team stalled, because the ODI side was playing better than ever. The county championship, meanwhile, was stripped of its star players and shunted away from high summer so that everyone could play limited-overs cricket when the sun was out. Next year, it will change again. The 50-over competition is crammed into May, the T20 Blast final jammed into late September, and the championship split into chunks and spread out around the out-grounds to make room for the World Cup. The ECB at least had a good argument for doing all this, even if it wasn\u2019t one everyone liked. The tournament is, as CEO Tom Harrison has said, a \u201conce-in-a-generation\u201d opportunity. Whisper it, but it feels like the ECB is well set to take advantage of it. Then there\u2019s The Hundred.

In a wide-ranging interview, Lewis also mused about everything from the four-day week to universal basic income, and how to ensure the rapid technological innovation of the \u201cfourth industrial revolution\u201d benefits the wider public.

But the former army reservist and TV reporter does not fit the mould of a career politician and has repeatedly charged headlong into controversy. In 2016, as shadow defence secretary, he clashed with Corbyn\u2019s close aide Seumas Milne over last-minute changes to a party conference speech.

Lewis, who postponed his wedding to defend a wafer-thin majority in the 2017 general election, and recently became a father for the first time, said he found the BBC documentary Blue Planet too unsettling to watch. \u201cI couldn\u2019t watch BP for a long time, until I started doing this job, because I knew in my heart that Blue Planet, as beautiful as it was, at the end they would always have the human impact, and I struggled to watch it because I felt so powerless,\u201d he said.

Digging with a garden shovel and jackknife, Kathy Wankel unearthed a complete T rex arm. A local expert excavated the rest.

If they came across something that was already dead they would scavenge. But they also were truly predatory at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>Stomping on and biting the hapless triceratops, the T rex is not alone in playing to the gallery.

So we\u2019ve got predatory scenes like with our T-rex, which is clearly a dramatic moment, but then we also have ones where they\u2019re slumbering or gently scratching the side of the face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b2a531fbbdae4795c04ce24bd1fdb49a5c5d634\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b2a531fbbdae4795c04ce24bd1fdb49a5c5d634/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The new dinosaur and fossil hall at the National Museum of Natural History.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The new dinosaur and fossil hall at the National Museum of Natural History.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jocelyn Augustino/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to capture all phases of life, not just the most dramatic.

The idea is to make them both scientifically accurate and make you start thinking about them as a living organism that lived in a real place in an ecosystem with other living things around it, just like organisms do today.\u201d</p> <p>Other highlights in what is billed as the most visited room in the most visited natural history museum in the world include the first fossil to be given the name Stegosaurus as well as a Mastodon rearing up under a quotation from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/jun/22/darwinbicentenary.evolution\">Charles Darwin:</a> \u201cFrom so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\u201d There are also some new acquisitions.

The Smithsonian Institution\u2019s 19 museums and zoo contain everything from Abraham Lincoln\u2019s last silk stovepipe hat to Charles Lindbergh\u2019s Spirit of St Louis, but there had always been a T rex-shaped hole in the collection. Visitors to the old hall had to make do with a cast replica. But 30 years ago a Montana rancher, hiking with her family on land managed by the US army corps of engineers in the Hell Creek Formation, made a startling discovery. Digging with a garden shovel and jackknife, Kathy Wankel unearthed a complete T rex arm. A local expert excavated the rest. In 2014 the specimen was loaned to the Smithsonian for 50 years and now the skeleton has been assembled. It is an especially important T rex because of \u201call the debate about why the tiny little arms\u201d, said Starrs, project manager in the museum\u2019s office of exhibits. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complete specimen for T rexes and it has the most complete arm ever found, including all digits, which helped advance science because this is an ongoing question: how coulda truly predatory dinosaur can take down prey if its arms are almost vestigial looking? \u201cWe present this as a question of open science in the exhibition because it really isn\u2019t fully resolved, but they were probably scavengers and predators both, so they were just the perfect eating machine. If they came across something that was already dead they would scavenge. But they also were truly predatory at the same time.\u201d Stomping on and biting the hapless triceratops, the T rex is not alone in playing to the gallery. Starrs (\u201cI have kids so of course I love Jurassic Park\u201d) explained: \u201cIt definitely was an important goal of ours that we wanted things to be as lifelike as possible, which doesn\u2019t always mean high drama. So we\u2019ve got predatory scenes like with our T-rex, which is clearly a dramatic moment, but then we also have ones where they\u2019re slumbering or gently scratching the side of the face. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to capture all phases of life, not just the most dramatic. Our Allosaurus is where we decided to take a predator and put it in in a surprising pose, a nesting scene, so it\u2019s sitting with a clutch of eggs within its protective tail curve. The idea is to make them both scientifically accurate and make you start thinking about them as a living organism that lived in a real place in an ecosystem with other living things around it, just like organisms do today.\u201d Other highlights in what is billed as the most visited room in the most visited natural history museum in the world include the first fossil to be given the name Stegosaurus as well as a Mastodon rearing up under a quotation from Charles Darwin: \u201cFrom so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\u201d There are also some new acquisitions. Starrs said cryptically: \u201cThe most exciting one was a recent gift I can\u2019t really talk about but it\u2019s going to be great when visitors see it.\u201d During the hall\u2019s shutdown, all specimens were removed for conservation and study by Smithsonian scientists in a network of specially created labs and storage units in the bowels of the museum (\u201cNo social media post please\u201d reads a sign with red lines through Facebook, Twitter and camera symbols). The biggest and heaviest fossils were disassembled and transported to \u201cdino builders\u201d Research Casting International near Toronto in Canada, where they were repositioned into more scientifically accurate poses. In some cases it was almost like a second excavation. A Gorgosaurus skull, for example, that had been half-embedded in plaster during a previous preservation process turned out to have a complete other side with even a full row of teeth. The first Ceratosaurus ever found, tantalisingly inaccessible to scientists for more than a century because it was half-buried in a museum wall, was labouriously extracted with hammer and chisel and power tools. Steve Jabo, a preparator proudly surveying the Ceratosaurus cast that will be displayed on its back in a losing fight against the Stegosaurus, explained: \u201cIt was locked in the wall in 1910. We didn\u2019t know what the back would look like. The skull was smashed flat \u2013 it just happens geologically \u2013 but we had a guy who makes moulds reinflate it to 3D instead of being pancaked.\u201d The gallery will depict life on earth\u2019s epic journey of more than 3.7bn years, teasing out themes and fundamental questions around natural selection, ecosystems changes and mass extinctions. It also comes with a timely message about the impact of us. Starrs said: \u201cWe\u2019re using the past as a point of entry and understanding the human footprint on the planet today. That\u2019s revolutionary. \u201cAre we headed to another mass extinction and are we driving that as a species? It was an asteroid and now is it humans? We tackle these questions in the exhibition which I\u2019ve never seen done in a fossil hall before.\u201d Yet the hall will carry David Koch\u2019s name. He and his brother Charles have sent at least $100m directly to 84 groups denying climate change science since 1997, according to Greenpeace. David Koch\u2019s donation comes at a time when museums are under greater scrutiny than ever over their sources of funding. Last April protesters gathered at the Smithsonian\u2019s Arthur M Sackler Gallery of Art to focus attention on what they claim is the wealthy family\u2019s role in the opioid crisis. Randall Kremer, the director of public affairs at the Natural History Museum, said: \u201cThe question certainly comes up but we don\u2019t vet our donors on anything more than whether they believe in the mission. In the case of Mr Koch, he\u2019s been on the board of the museum for a decade and is one of the preeminent philanthropists in the United States. Beyond that, it\u2019s not an issue.\u201d",

Macron \u2013 whose approval ratings have plummeted in 2018 as he failed to shake the label \u201cpresident of the rich\u201d and faced an unprecedented citizens\u2019 protest movement \u2013 went on the offensive in his televised new year\u2019s speech. He deliberately did not name the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement that has been demonstrating against the government at road blockades and weekly city centre protests for six weeks. But he criticised what he called a minority who, he said, claimed to be the voice of the people but were in fact \u201cmegaphones of a hateful crowd who have lashed out at elected politicians, security forces, journalists, Jews, foreigners, homosexuals\u201d. Macron said this hatefulness was \u201cthe negation of France\u201d and that \u201cour future depends on our capacity to love each other and to love our nation.\u201d He said he had \u201cseen the unthinkable and heard the unacceptable\u201d in recent weeks and that \u201corder\u201d in France would be maintained. Macron spoke as more than 147,000 security forces were mobilised across the country for new year\u2019s celebrations, not just because of the terrorist threat in France but also because authorities feared surprise demonstrations by anti-government protestrs. About 300,000 tourists and revellers were expected on the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es on New Year\u2019s Eve for Paris\u2019s annual light show, which is projected on to the Arc de Triomphe and was the target of protesters this month.

But he said it had been brewing for a long time \u2013 implying he did not accept the blame but instead laid responsibility on decades of mass unemployment and what he has called years of political stagnation. Macron tried to channel the positivity of the anger, saying it \u201cshowed us that we\u2019re not resigned to anything, that our country wants to build a better future\u201d. He was careful to use the words \u201cus\u201d and \u201cwe\u201d to avoid appearing cut off from the public mood. After he was mocked for the staid style of a recent televised speech aimed at calming the protests, which was delivered seated at a desk in a gilded room, this time Macron stood up in a more modern room in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. After some in Macron\u2019s shrinking supporter base feared he would step back from his manifesto promise of structural reforms because of the unrest, the president went on the offensive, vowing to press on with his plans to overhaul the social welfare state and social protection in 2019, beginning with changes to unemployment benefits. He said of his changes so far, including loosening of labour laws: \u201cThe results can\u2019t be immediate, and impatience \u2013 which I share \u2013 can\u2019t justify any kind of giving up.\u201d He repeated his argument that unbridled, lawless \u201cultra free-market\u201d capitalism was at its end, suggesting he wanted to reinvent a new form of responsible globalisation in a Europe that \u201cprotects\u201d.

Distinct. Neat. An island race. The British Isles. The departure of Eire, the decades long counter-insurgency in Ulster, resurgent Scottish and Welsh nationalism, all inconvenient, all ignored. Splendid isolation, the myth of an imperial Britain standing aloof from Europe in the late 19th century, is their nirvana. Hence the absurd, barely disguised references to empire revivified. There was little splendid about Britain\u2019s isolation just over a century ago. It meant that things happened, without Britain having any control. Prussia forged a German superstate. Britain\u2019s two greatest imperial rivals, Russia and France, became close allies. The neighbourhood got a lot tougher while Britons placed their faith in Royal Navy battleships in the Channel.</p> <p>Our greatest statesmen and women have understood our vulnerability to what happens on the continent. They have tried to shape events there, rather than watch as spectators, sitting it out and passively accepting the result. Elizabeth intervened to stop the Spanish superpower consolidate its grip on the low countries. William, Anne and the Duke of Marlborough revolutionised the English and British state to thwart Louis XIV\u2019s dream of universal empire. A reluctant David Lloyd George was persuaded that imperial Germany represented an intolerable threat in August 1914. For them, isolation was impotence.</p> <p>We do not get to decide. We do not get to suspend the lunar pull of Europe. We get to argue, negotiate, win, compromise and lose until the end of time. Leaving the European Union is not an end.

In the 17th century, while Peter the Great worked thousands of his subjects to death building a French-designed baroque capital in Saint Petersburg, the Stuarts built a mighty new St Paul\u2019s in similar style. They lured Anthony Van Dyck and Peter Paul Rubens to beautify their court and founded the Royal Society to compete with the \u201cphilosophical societies\u201d of France. Britain and Russia were both transformed by ideas emanating from Europe \u2013 from the writings of Nicolaus Copernicus who fired the creativity of Isaac Newton and unleashed a scientific revolution in the former, to those of Karl Marx that sparked a communist one in the latter. The capillaries of the nostalgic right fizz with the heady drugs peddled by 19th century nationalists: one people, one nation. Distinct. Neat. An island race. The British Isles. The departure of Eire, the decades long counter-insurgency in Ulster, resurgent Scottish and Welsh nationalism, all inconvenient, all ignored. Splendid isolation, the myth of an imperial Britain standing aloof from Europe in the late 19th century, is their nirvana. Hence the absurd, barely disguised references to empire revivified. There was little splendid about Britain\u2019s isolation just over a century ago. It meant that things happened, without Britain having any control. Prussia forged a German superstate. Britain\u2019s two greatest imperial rivals, Russia and France, became close allies. The neighbourhood got a lot tougher while Britons placed their faith in Royal Navy battleships in the Channel. Our greatest statesmen and women have understood our vulnerability to what happens on the continent. They have tried to shape events there, rather than watch as spectators, sitting it out and passively accepting the result. Elizabeth intervened to stop the Spanish superpower consolidate its grip on the low countries. William, Anne and the Duke of Marlborough revolutionised the English and British state to thwart Louis XIV\u2019s dream of universal empire. A reluctant David Lloyd George was persuaded that imperial Germany represented an intolerable threat in August 1914. For them, isolation was impotence. We do not get to decide. We do not get to suspend the lunar pull of Europe. We get to argue, negotiate, win, compromise and lose until the end of time. Leaving the European Union is not an end. It is the beginning of more wrangling, more competition, collaboration and codependence. \u2022 Dan Snow is a television presenter and historian",

      "bodyText": "Jill Ellis did not ponder the question for long. The USA\u2019s English-born manager had just been asked if France 2019 would be the most competitive Women\u2019s World Cup to date and her answer spoke volumes. \u201cIs it going to the hardest to win?\u201d mused the coach who led her adopted country to glory in Canada four years ago. \u201cWell, every World Cup should be bigger and better than the one before and, in terms of the standard of the teams alone, I think France is going to be a spectacular tournament.\u201d With 24 countries competing across nine venues from Valenciennes to Montpellier and Le Havre to Grenoble, the tournament has doubled in size since the USA beat Norway at Fifa\u2019s first formal World Cup, in China in 1991. Back then media coverage was limited. As recently as Canada 2015 only three UK newspapers sent dedicated reporters to watch England secure a bronze medal \u2013 but that will change in France where British journalists are scheduled to descend on masse. Some will arrive in Nice \u2013 where Phil Neville\u2019s England face Shelley Kerr\u2019s Scotland in their opening game on 9 June ready to cast critical eyes over a branch of the sport they may be new to. The challenge confronting England\u2019s Fran Kirby, Scotland\u2019s Kim Little and their fellow star players is to capture the hearts and minds of both the mainstream media and British television audiences. The reaction at home could well determine whether England\u2019s newly all professional Women\u2019s Super League finally starts attracting the attendances and commercial deals required for long term sustainability. \u201cWomen\u2019s football is at a bit of a tipping point at the moment,\u201d says Casey Stoney, the former England captain turned Manchester United manager. \u201cIf England win this World Cup it might just tip it to where we want it to go. It\u2019s going to be an exciting tournament in a good timezone for television.\u201d The final, in Lyon on 7 July, could perhaps do with a tranformative Brandi Chastain-type moment. No one should underestimate the importance of a sultry Californian summer\u2019s evening in 1999 and the single swipe of Chastain\u2019s left foot which converted a penalty against China to win the USA the World Cup. As she celebrated by whipping off her shirt to reveal a black sports bra, the 90,185 crowd - a record live attendance for an international women\u2019s sporting event - inside Pasadena\u2019s Rosebowl swayed to Jennifer Lopez\u2019s Let\u2019s Get Loud. Admittedly Chastain\u2019s iconic cameo would eventually be seen as a starting gun for evolution rather than revolution but, temporarily at least, the world woke up to female football\u2019s potential. Sponsors facilitated a North American professional league only to find its durability would prove the sort of mirage more usually found in the Mojave desert. Two decades on, the US league is in its third incarnation, the previous two having folded, while the WSL is Europe\u2019s sole professional divison. The latter\u2019s inaugural season has attracted stubbornly low crowds, often in the hundreds for high calibre games. It is easy to see why the Football Association is so desperate for England to secure the World Cup trophy it feels would galvanise the domestic game. These days Neville\u2019s star players, Lyon\u2019s Lucy Bronze among them, can command six-figure salaries from club and central England contracts but a little lower down the pecking order, a sense of fragility feels pervasive. Tellingly, the majority of players at WSL Yeovil earn the minimum wage with such inequality and insecurity at least seeming in step with some of the wider world\u2019s troubles. With somewhat unfortunate timing, December\u2019s glitzy tournament draw in Paris \u2013 which placed England and a Scotland side participating in their first finals in the same initial group as the not to be underestimated 2011 winners and 2015 finalists Japan \u2013 coincided with a weekend of violent anti government protests across France\u2019s capital. If the gilets jaunes will presumably be appeased by June and the bubble wrap surrounding Fifa events invariably transforms tournament venues into temporary Narnias, terrorism remains a threat. The men\u2019s 2016 European Championship finals passed off peacefully but France\u2019s security services remain mindful of the danger. Such fears were evident in a stadium lift at Valenciennes in October 2017 when England played a friendly against France and an armed policeman spotted a journalist apparently lacking an identifying \u201cmedia personnel\u201d lanyard. It had merely become hidden beneath a coat but the speed with which the officer readied his gun seemed instructive. Neville is currently honing England\u2019s preparations to out-manoeuvre fellow contenders, including the US, Germany, Canada, Australia, Japan and France in securing prize money worth $4m to the winners - or $34m less than Didier Deschamps\u2019s men earned for triumphing at Russia 2019. While Neville needs to prove he is as smart a tactician as his predecessor Mark Sampson \u2013 sacked for non-football reasons \u2013 France\u2019s Corinne Diacre is under pressure to emulate Deschamps\u2019 achievement. After spending three largely successful years as the first woman to coach a French men\u2019s team, second tier Clermont, she should be tough enough to get the best from a talented, yet arguably flaky, squad yet remains cautious. \u201cMy objective is to at least reach the semi-finals but we\u2019re outsiders,\u201d says Diacre. \u201cThe USA are favourites, they have a winning culture.\u201d",

After all, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, it\u2019s now 2019. Our new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/30/trump-america-this-isnt-normal\">reality</a> is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin\">doing everything it can</a> to wipe the smiles off our faces and it feels like there\u2019s plenty <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/30/things-to-watch-out-for-in-2019-doom-and-plenty-of-gloom?CMP=twt_gu\">more dolour to come</a>. But in this fortunate corner of the internet, we can take refuge. We can even spread a little light, taking our lead from none other than the immortal PG Wodehouse, who wrote in Something Fresh:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cAs we grow older and realise more clearly the limitations of human happiness, we come to see that the only real and abiding pleasure in life is to give pleasure to other people.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The fact that this line was actually the cue for various witticisms and sarcasms about the mercilessly efficient secretary Baxter and his failure to take pleasure in anything should only encourage us. Wodehouse was serious about spreading joy \u2013 even when he was joking. Something Fresh (the very first Blandings Castle novel) was written and published during the painful early years of the first world war, and must have given its many readers much needed respite. Wodehouse himself didn\u2019t go overboard on such reflections, but perhaps the state of the world was on his mind when he wrote the following about \u201cyoung idiot\u201d Freddie Threepwood:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cHis was a life which lacked, perhaps, the sublimer emotions which raised Man to the level of the gods, but it was undeniably an extremely happy one. He never experienced the thrill of ambition fulfilled, but, on the other hand, he never knew the agony of ambition frustrated. His name, when he died, would not live for ever in England\u2019s annals; he was spared the pain of worrying about this by the fact that he had no desire to live for ever in England\u2019s annals. He was possibly as nearly contented a human being can be in this century of alarms and excursions.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Again, Wodehouse was joking \u2013 but you can understand how a few hours spent in the company of the Honourable Freddie might come as a relief from worrying about the world.</p> <p>Just in case you think I\u2019m advocating too hard for Wodehouse this month, I\u2019m also happy to admit that there are other writers who have also written funny books. Perhaps not <em>quite</em> as funny as Plum, but still wonderful to read. In fact, this could be one of the broadest categories we\u2019ve ever had on the Reading group, offering us a range stretching at least as far back as Aristophanes and his strap-on willies, up to the potential contenders for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/10/helen-lederer-launches-prize-for-funny-female-writers-comedy-women-in-print\">the new Comedy women in print prize</a>.</p> <p>Since I\u2019ve already pushed a personal favourite, I\u2019ll suggest others: Evelyn Waugh\u2019s outstanding Sword Of Honour trilogy, a novel from Anthony Powell\u2019s A Dance To The Music Of Time sequence, or anything by the late great Terry Pratchett.

That said, here are our best guesses for the year ahead.</p> <h2><strong>Diageo</strong></h2> <p>The year could well be one of economic turmoil. If so, investors will rush to store their money in more defensive stocks that are unlikely to be hit too hard by Brexit, trade wars or a global slowdown. A fall in discretionary spending would still affect Diageo, which ended the year at \u00a327.95, but the booze giant also has a good international spread, meaning stronger markets can help offset weaker ones. Let\u2019s face it, if times get tough we may all have good reason to drown our sorrows. <strong>Rob Davies</strong></p> <h2><strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong></h2> <p>GSK surprised investors by announcing a break-up of the business in December, giving it something it had long been clamouring for. The drugmaker will spin off its Panadol and Sensodyne consumer healthcare unit into a joint venture with Pfizer within three years, retaining majority control. It is the second bold move by chief executive Emma Walmsley, after the acquisition of US cancer specialist Tesaro for a hefty \u00a34bn. The deal shows Walmsley is serious about beefing up GSK\u2019s pharma business, and its new HIV 2-drug regimen and shingles vaccine Shingrix look promising. GSK, at \u00a314.91, has also given assurances on the 2019 dividend. <strong>Julia Kollewe</strong></p> <h2><strong>Iberdrola</strong></h2> <p>At \u20ac7.02, ScottishPower\u2019s giant Spanish-listed owner looks a good bet for 2019. The company\u2019s global push into wind and solar has seen it performing strongly in recent years, and this looks set to continue. In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/16/scottish-power-wind-drax-sale-uk-energy-firms\">ScottishPower has exited fossil fuel power</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/19/scottishpower-to-invest-in-solar-energy-for-the-first-time\">said it will bid in a key government auction</a> for offshore windfarm subsidies. The UK energy price cap will hit its supply business, but that\u2019s a wrinkle in an otherwise attractive prospect. <strong>Adam Vaughan</strong></p> <h2><strong>Segro</strong></h2> <p>The storm clouds might be gathering for the global economy with Britain at the centre ahead of Brexit, but one potential safe haven for investors could be the industrial warehouse sector. With a growing number of UK companies stockpiling in preparation for possible border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit, warehouse space is in demand. Consumers are also shifting their shopping online, raising demand for industrial \u201cshed\u201d space to handle internet orders. </p> <p>Although it\u2019s already had a good few years, Segro, at 588.6p, could benefit further as the biggest warehousing company in the FTSE 100. It also benefits from diversity, with locations outside the UK in Germany, France, Poland and elsewhere across the EU. <strong>Richard Partington</strong></p> <h2><strong>BT</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/btgroup\">BT</a>\u2019s new boss Philip Jansen arrives on 1 February with a mandate to revive the embattled telecoms group. Outgoing chief executive Gavin Patterson has already started the job, having announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/10/bt-to-axe-13000-jobs-and-move-out-of-london-hq\">13,000 job cuts </a> over a three-year period as part of a \u00a31.5bn cost-cutting drive. It falls to Jansen to address lingering strategic questions, such as the future of its Openreach subsidiary, after shareholders \u2014 and activist investor Greenlight Capital \u2014 pushed for a spin off this year. He will also have to decide whether its multibillion pound sports broadcasting rights strategy is a good use of shareholders\u2019 cash. At 238.1p, there could be plenty to get the shares moving. <strong>Zoe Wood</strong></p> <h2><strong>Burford Capital</strong></h2> <p>Investors in the UK and beyond have reason to be nervous going into 2019, but one company which has a good claim to be better protected than most against Brexit turmoil or the end of an ageing business cycle is Burford Capital. The litigation funder picks juicy court cases it thinks will result in big payouts and backs them with the cash \u2013 more than $3bn so far \u2013 to hire top barristers. Scale and diversification are key in this game, and Aim-listed Burford, at \u00a316.56, is eyeing an enormous and little-served international market. When the tide goes out some companies are left exposed \u2013 and the lawyers (mostly) win. <strong>Jasper Jolly</strong></p> <h2><strong>Johnson Matthey</strong></h2> <p>The year brings huge uncertainty but the quest for cleaner air and reduced emissions will surely remain high on the global agenda. Johnson Matthey, the sustainable technologies expert, could be well positioned to benefit. Not only is it a leading maker of catalytic converters at a time when European and Chinese regulators are tightening emission rules, it is also developing materials for the rapidly growing area of electric batteries. The company is not immune to the impact of a no-deal Brexit, but it does benefit from a global footprint and diverse sector spread. In November, the company hiked the interim dividend, signalling confidence in its earning potential. At \u00a327.99, it could be one to watch. <strong>Angela Monaghan</strong></p> <h2><strong>Morrisons</strong></h2> <p>Morrisons enjoyed a steady 2018 and has a number of tricks up its sleeve as shoppers uncertain about the impact of Brexit rein in spending. New areas of growth for the supermarket chain including wholesale via Amazon and petrol stations could help to offset competition from the likes of Aldi, Lidl and Tesco. The company is well placed to pick up stores that may have to be offloaded by rivals Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s if their merger goes ahead and the shares, at 213.3p, are also underpinned by rumours of a bid from Amazon. Problems with its deal with McColls and supply difficulties caused by Brexit are potential risks, but the management team seem well prepared to deal with them. <strong>Sarah Butler</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/12/sharetips-zip/giv-3902QT3eCKba7mLj/\" data-alt=\"2018 predictions\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/12/sharetips-zip/giv-3902QT3eCKba7mLj/\">2018 predictions</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>Sumo Group</strong></h2> <p>Video games are a massive global market, with more than 2 billion players supporting an industry that is expected to grow from $138bn (\u00a3109bn) this year to $180bn by 2021. Sheffield-based Sumo Group is one of more than 2,200 UK-based games makers hoping to capitalise on that growth. Sumo develops games in partnership with major industry players, such as Sony, Microsoft and Sega, creating products including Little Big Planet 3 for Sony and Sonic and Sega All-Stars. At 118.5p, its shares have climbed more than 3% in 2018 \u2013 although it was trading at more than 180p at one point last year \u2013 with stockbroker Peel Hunt placing a target of 200p on the Aim-listed business. It is an expanding (if loss-making) business, having made two acquisitions last year, and it is protected by customer contracts that have a duration of between 18 and 48 months. <strong>Dan Milmo</strong></p> <h2><strong>Sage Group</strong></h2> <p>Sage Group, at 601.4p, has not bombed since the Brexit vote \u2013 although it has recently warned on margins. It is the sort of established company that gives you some kind of confidence that it might not lose you all your money. The accountancy software firm also has a new chief executive, who you assume is trying to make his mark. And it has just announced decent profits, albeit warning about profitability in the future. Not exactly a screaming buy, admittedly. But let\u2019s face it. This is a guessing game, even at the best of times. <strong>Simon Goodley</strong></p>",

Ultimately, only a judge can decide whether a company or organisation has broken the law.\u201d The campaign group Which? says that the law is clear \u2013 to stop customers being penalised for paying by card \u2013 and traders should be called out for flouting it. \u201cWe are hearing stories of people continuing to pay card fees, with some companies still passing on extra charges to their customers,\u201d says Gareth Shaw of Which? \u201cThe government and regulator need to closely monitor the impact of the ban, as well as look at the interchange fee regulation and the charges companies pay for processing card payments, to ensure that the reforms have the positive outcome for consumers originally intended.\u201d If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

      "body": "<p>I used to think I was pretty great at French: I could handle a subjunctive and disdained the myriad mangled pronunciations of \u201cmillefeuille\u201d on Masterchef. I lived in French-speaking Brussels for 12 years and have a French husband who still tolerates me misgendering the dishwasher after 24 years. My inflated sense of my abilities was bolstered over the years by compliments from surprised French people. Admittedly, the bar is pitifully low for Brits speaking a foreign language: like <a href=\"https://www.samueljohnson.com/dogwalk.html\" title=\"\">Samuel Johnson\u2019s dog walking on its hind legs</a>, it\u2019s not done well but people are surprised it\u2019s done at all.</p> <p>In recent years, however, I have let things slide. My French has become trashy: it\u2019s the language of reality and cooking shows (my staple French televisual diet) and easy chat with indulgent friends. I fear I speak French like Joey Essex speaks English, and since we moved back to the UK this year things have got worse. My only French conversation here is with my husband and it runs a well-worn course: who should empty the bin; why we have no money; which of our teenage sons hates us more. When I try to express something complex, I get stuck mid-sentence, unable to express my thoughts clearly. Words that used to be there, waiting to be used, are awol and I have developed a horrible habit of just saying them in English. My husband understands, so who cares?</p> <p>But I care. I can\u2019t bear to lose my French; it\u2019s part of who I am. I even wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/30/emma-beddington-well-always-have-paris-review\" title=\"\">a book about it</a>, for God\u2019s sake. I want to speak the language of Moli\u00e8re, if not like Moli\u00e8re then at least like a reasonably articulate adult. So I resolve to not just stop the rot but reverse it. This will involve a multi-pronged approach: online lessons plus conversation classes, supplemented by a diet of French podcasts and reading, including my third attempt at Les Mis\u00e9rables.</p> <p><em>Au boulot</em> \u2013 to work!</p> <h2>Week one</h2> <p>I take the Institut Fran\u00e7ais\u2019s <a href=\"https://frenchcourses.org.uk/\" title=\"\">online test</a> to check my level. It doesn\u2019t seem difficult but my result \u2013 \u201cfirst step to C1\u201d \u2013 is mortifying. I assumed I had C1 (the second-highest level of <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages/level-descriptions\" title=\"\">European official language qualification</a>) in the bag, but if this test could talk it would be saying: \u201c<em>Bof.</em>\u201d</p> <p>My first online lessons cheer me up: <a href=\"https://www.frantastique.com/en\" title=\"\">Frantastique</a> (a learning platform developed with the Institut Fran\u00e7ais, tagline: \u201cSurrender to French\u201d) is a riot. In my first session, I watch a short cartoon in which anarchic aliens incomprehensibly revive a naked, frozen Victor Hugo (beard preserving his modesty), after which I answer grammar and vocabulary questions about it. I enjoy it so much, I do seven lessons in one sitting: Victor visits the alien canteen, but the lack of mustard makes everyone so angry they head to Earth to find more. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ve learned \u2013 aliens love mustard? \u2013 but I\u2019m keen for more.</p> <p>One-to-one conversation classes at the <a href=\"http://www.alliancedeyork.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Alliance Fran\u00e7aise</a> (which has the mission of promoting French language and culture abroad) are a more serious affair. Christine Grimaud-Brown, my teacher and the director of the York branch, sends me an article on the 21st-century perception of time, no less, to prepare for our first session. It starts off as a relaxed chat and Christine doesn\u2019t correct my mistakes (I secretly yearn for this), but we soon get into fairly abstract territory and speaking to a stranger makes me raise my game. I can tell this will be useful.</p> <p>For extra speaking practice, I try the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise\u2019s Caf\u00e9 Conversation, a twice-weekly chat for French speakers, with a native facilitator. Anything goes, topic wise: on my first session, we cover cricket (including whether French has a word for \u201cwicket\u201d), pantomimes and green energy; later discussions range from Alzheimer\u2019s to cemeteries and Christmas cake. Levels vary although, broadly, the demographic is at the upper end of the scale: my French is tested explaining \u201cpi\u00f1ata\u201d (\u201ca paper animal in which sweets are placed. One strikes the animal with a stick\u201d) and \u201cHamilton\u201d (\u201ca popular musical of the American revolution utilising <em>le rap</em>\u201d) to other attendees and to universal confusion. I love it, though, and show off dreadfully.</p> <p>On my morning dog walks, I plunge into the rigorous world of <a href=\"https://www.lenouvelespritpublic.fr/\" title=\"\">Le Nouvel Esprit Public</a>, a geopolitics podcast featuring the kind of French intellectuals who would dip Melvyn Bragg in their <em>caf\u00e9 au lait</em> and eat him for breakfast. They speak in fluid, impassioned sentences about the US midterms or the Italian budget. It\u2019s exactly the kind of French I aspire to. I also enjoy <a href=\"http://passion-medievistes.lepodcast.fr/\" title=\"\">Passions M\u00e9di\u00e9vistes</a>, in which medievalists describe their esoteric research, but it precipitates a minor existential crisis: why aren\u2019t I researching dragons in medieval prayer books? \u201c<em>J\u2019ai rat\u00e9 ma vie</em>,\u201d (my life is a failure) I mutter, Frenchly.</p> <h2>Week two</h2> <p>Frantastique continues to entertain: Victor Hugo throws a wild party and the aliens hold a pro-mustard demo (\u201c<em>Libert\u00e9, Fraternit\u00e9, Moutarde,</em>\u201d reads one placard). Regrettably but predictably, I have become obsessed with my marks. The questions aren\u2019t difficult but I keep making stupid mistakes, to my own fury. Occasionally I feel hard done by: one afternoon my husband comes home to find me incandescent, brandishing a screengrab of a wood-burning stove.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I hiss angrily.</p> <p>\u201cEr, <em>un</em><em> po\u00eale</em>?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a <em>four</em> is it? I lost a mark for not calling it an oven!\u201d</p> <p>My conversation class with Christine is about art, so I read the heap of articles she provides, then write an excruciatingly bad essay. It reads like the work of a pretentious but dim 12-year old. \u201cWhat is art?\u201d I say clunkily, before attempting to describe a Marina Abramovi\u0107 performance (\u201cShe washes the bloody bones of a cow for three days\u201d), giving myself the giggles. In class, though, I really enjoy our discussion, and occasionally feel my lazy synapses creak into action, finding the right word or expression.</p> <p>My reading is patchy. Ga\u00ebl Faye\u2019s excellent novel Petit Pays, about the genocide in Burundi, teaches me \u201cthreadbare\u201d, \u201ccalabash\u201d and \u201cserval\u201d (admittedly, I don\u2019t know what the last two actually are). Les Mis\u00e9rables, however, induces instant deep sleep and \u2013 now that Frantastique has transformed Victor Hugo into a tiny, naked sex god in my mind \u2013 floridly peculiar dreams.</p> <h2>Week three</h2> <p>I test some new podcasts, including <a href=\"https://www.nouvellesecoutes.fr/vieille-branche/\" title=\"\">Vieille Branche</a>, a series of interviews with older, outspoken and fascinating French public figures (I especially enjoy 88-year-old S&amp;M mistress Catherine Robbe-Grillet). At the other end of the spectrum, I fall in love with <a href=\"https://louiemedia.com/entre/\" title=\"\">Entre</a>: tender, funny conversations with Justine, a sparky and delightful 11-year-old grappling with school, friendships and family. Each episode is five to 10 minutes long, perfect for learners.</p> <p>In class, we discuss fake news. I feel relaxed talking to Christine, but I notice she has a skilful way of pushing me into expressing more complex ideas with her questions. \u201cDoes society still care about truth?\u201d she asks. Or: \u201cIs national character a product of language or vice versa?\u201d Sometimes I answer fluently; sometimes I end up stumbling and stuck.</p> <p>There are signs of progress. I finally stagger up a level on Frantastique, despite my constant blunders. At Caf\u00e9 Conversation, in my capacity as class swot (<em>fayot</em>), I am asked to translate \u201cpick your brain\u201d, \u201cquirky\u201d and \u201callotment\u201d and as I slalom between shoals of tourists when I leave, a hissed \u201c<em>Pardon</em>\u201d comes to my lips rather than the usual Yorkshire tut.</p> <h2>Week four</h2> <p>My Frantastique experience draws to an ignominious close as I cravenly resort to cheating on the spelling of \u201c<em>environnemental</em>\u201d. Worse, I get 47% one day, due to my apparent inability to follow simple instructions conjugating the imperfect. I will miss Victor, and G\u00e9rard, a drooling, mustard-crazed alien blob on whom I have a bit of a crush.</p> <p>Has my French improved? My general knowledge certainly has: I know more about Breton medieval government, the artist Paul S\u00e9rusier and Armenian politics than I ever anticipated. On one glorious occasion in class, I supplied a word Christine had forgotten (\u201c<em>l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer</em>\u201d, legislate). I have barely started Les Mis\u00e9rables, but already have some vocabulary that would be handy if I were a low-ranking cleric in Restoration France.</p> <p>Even so, when I retake the Institut Fran\u00e7ais test, I get that maddening \u201cfirst step to C1\u201d again. <em>J\u2019suis d\u00e9g</em>, as I would say in Joey Essex French. I\u2019m gutted, but I shouldn\u2019t be. \u201cAt your level, progress is much more subtle,\u201d Christine reassures me. I do think something has started to shift: now when my husband and I watch the news, I find myself moved to launch into fluent sentences of Gallic vitriol at the sight of Jacob Rees-Mogg rather than Anglo-Saxon expletives. Better still, I have been powerfully reminded what I love about France and French: that fiercely cerebral public culture and the sheer beauty of its words. In one podcast someone casually uses \u201c<em>lacustr</em>e\u201d (lacustrine, meaning of or relating to lakes); it\u2019s so lovely I have to stop and write it down. By Victor Hugo\u2019s beard, I will rise above my trash French and become the kind of person who says <em>lacustr</em>e.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7fa9e9413d1bea0177b55cb01bcb35fa78b361c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fa9e9413d1bea0177b55cb01bcb35fa78b361c1/0_0_5265_3494/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jupiter, king of the gods ... to be jupit\u00e9rien is to be haughty in the manner of Emmanuel Macron.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jupiter, king of the gods ... to be <em>jupit\u00e9rien </em>is to be haughty in the manner of Emmanuel Macron.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How to sound \u2018with it\u2019 in French \u2026</h2> <p><strong>From vloggeuse to startupeur or swag, most \u201chip\u201d French words are English ones: chatbot, queer and cosplay all entered the Petit Robert dictionary this year. But here are a few that keep a Gallic flavour.</strong></p> <p><strong>Mecspliquer </strong>To mansplain. A <em>mot-valise</em> (portmanteau word) composed of <em>mec</em> (guy) and <em>expliquer</em> (to explain).</p> <p><strong>Lourd</strong> Literally \u201cheavy\u201d, and generally used to mean tiresome, but now, in an adult-bamboozling plot twist, it means good, pleasing. <em>C\u2019est du lourd</em> or <em>\u00e7a envoie du lourd</em> = it is impressive. The <em>verlan</em> (backwards slang) version, <em>relou</em>, is still used to mean annoying, or a pain. All clear? <em>Clair comme de l\u2019eau de boudin</em> (as clear as black pudding water, another great expression).</p> <p><strong>PTDR </strong><em>P\u00e9t\u00e9 de rire</em>, literally \u201cbroken with mirth\u201d, the French LOL. Although, of course, most French people use \u201cLOL\u201d.</p> <p><strong>P\u00e9cho</strong> To seduce, get together with, hook up. <em>Verlan</em> of <em>choper</em> (to seize or get).</p> <p><strong>J\u2019ai le seum</strong> I am displeased/angry/disappointed.</p> <p><strong>J\u2019ai failli p\u00e9cho ce gars, mais il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 me mecspliquer ma propre th\u00e8se doctorale. C\u2019est archi-relou, j\u2019ai le seum.</strong> I nearly hooked up with this guy, but he started to mansplain my own PhD thesis to me. It\u2019s such a pain, I\u2019m gutted.</p> <h2>\u2026 and how to sound like an intellectual</h2> <p><strong>Give your conversation a soup\u00e7on of Left Bank va-va-vo</strong><strong>om.</strong></p> <p><strong>Langage \u00e9pic\u00e8ne </strong>Also known as <em>\u00e9criture inclusive</em>, this controversial but increasingly popular typography style uses a <em>point m\u00e9dian</em>, a sort of decimal point, to create gender-neutral nouns. So a person reading this would be <em>un\u00b7e lecteur\u00b7rice</em> and the person writing it would be be <em>un\u00b7e journaliste </em>(or <em>un\u00b7e idiot\u00b7e</em>). Last year the French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, banned the <em>point m\u00e9dian</em> in official documents with an inflammatory declaration that \u201cthe masculine is a neutral form\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Jupit\u00e9rien</strong> From Jupiter, king of the gods. Applied to Emmanuel Macron\u2019s presidential style (he used the term to contrast with the more down-to-earth approach of his predecessor, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande), it implies a degree of deliberate distance and grandeur and is now used by his critics to suggest he is haughty or arrogant. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/call-me-mr-president-emmanuel-macron-scolds-teenager\" title=\"\">Telling a teenager to call you \u201cMonsieur le Pr\u00e9sident\u201d</a> = <em>jupit\u00e9rien</em>.</p> <p><strong>Cart\u00e9sien</strong> My go-to word to sound intelligent in French. Derived from philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes, it\u2019s used generically to mean \u201clogical\u201d or \u201crational\u201d. <em>Du point de vue purement cart\u00e9sien</em> (from a purely rational perspective) is a good (inflammatory) start to a sentence in a French argument.</p> <p><strong>Charge mentale </strong>Mental load or burden. A hot topic of feminist debate following the publication last year of cartoonist Emma\u2019s Fallait Demander \u2013 You Should Have Asked \u2013 on women\u2019s experience of continually having to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/02/drawn-from-experience-meet-the-feminist-author-whose-comic-strips-hit-home\" title=\"\">anticipate and meet their families\u2019 myriad needs</a>. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chargementale\" title=\"\">Twitter account @chargementale</a> collates some of the most egregious examples of paternal ineptitude encountered by doctors in French paediatrics.</p> <p><strong>J\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 voir tout le temps des crabes autour de moi</strong> I started to see crabs around me all the time. Not an everyday expression, but handy if you wish to reproduce Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s ill-advised 1970s experiment with mescaline. Life as a French intellectual is a dangerous business.</p>",

Ga\u00ebl Faye\u2019s excellent novel Petit Pays, about the genocide in Burundi, teaches me \u201cthreadbare\u201d, \u201ccalabash\u201d and \u201cserval\u201d (admittedly, I don\u2019t know what the last two actually are). Les Mis\u00e9rables, however, induces instant deep sleep and \u2013 now that Frantastique has transformed Victor Hugo into a tiny, naked sex god in my mind \u2013 floridly peculiar dreams. Week three I test some new podcasts, including Vieille Branche, a series of interviews with older, outspoken and fascinating French public figures (I especially enjoy 88-year-old S&amp;M mistress Catherine Robbe-Grillet). At the other end of the spectrum, I fall in love with Entre: tender, funny conversations with Justine, a sparky and delightful 11-year-old grappling with school, friendships and family. Each episode is five to 10 minutes long, perfect for learners. In class, we discuss fake news. I feel relaxed talking to Christine, but I notice she has a skilful way of pushing me into expressing more complex ideas with her questions. \u201cDoes society still care about truth?\u201d she asks. Or: \u201cIs national character a product of language or vice versa?\u201d Sometimes I answer fluently; sometimes I end up stumbling and stuck. There are signs of progress. I finally stagger up a level on Frantastique, despite my constant blunders. At Caf\u00e9 Conversation, in my capacity as class swot (fayot), I am asked to translate \u201cpick your brain\u201d, \u201cquirky\u201d and \u201callotment\u201d and as I slalom between shoals of tourists when I leave, a hissed \u201cPardon\u201d comes to my lips rather than the usual Yorkshire tut. Week four My Frantastique experience draws to an ignominious close as I cravenly resort to cheating on the spelling of \u201cenvironnemental\u201d. Worse, I get 47% one day, due to my apparent inability to follow simple instructions conjugating the imperfect. I will miss Victor, and G\u00e9rard, a drooling, mustard-crazed alien blob on whom I have a bit of a crush. Has my French improved? My general knowledge certainly has: I know more about Breton medieval government, the artist Paul S\u00e9rusier and Armenian politics than I ever anticipated. On one glorious occasion in class, I supplied a word Christine had forgotten (\u201cl\u00e9gif\u00e9rer\u201d, legislate). I have barely started Les Mis\u00e9rables, but already have some vocabulary that would be handy if I were a low-ranking cleric in Restoration France. Even so, when I retake the Institut Fran\u00e7ais test, I get that maddening \u201cfirst step to C1\u201d again. J\u2019suis d\u00e9g, as I would say in Joey Essex French. I\u2019m gutted, but I shouldn\u2019t be. \u201cAt your level, progress is much more subtle,\u201d Christine reassures me. I do think something has started to shift: now when my husband and I watch the news, I find myself moved to launch into fluent sentences of Gallic vitriol at the sight of Jacob Rees-Mogg rather than Anglo-Saxon expletives. Better still, I have been powerfully reminded what I love about France and French: that fiercely cerebral public culture and the sheer beauty of its words. In one podcast someone casually uses \u201clacustre\u201d (lacustrine, meaning of or relating to lakes); it\u2019s so lovely I have to stop and write it down. By Victor Hugo\u2019s beard, I will rise above my trash French and become the kind of person who says lacustre. How to sound \u2018with it\u2019 in French \u2026 From vloggeuse to startupeur or swag, most \u201chip\u201d French words are English ones: chatbot, queer and cosplay all entered the Petit Robert dictionary this year. But here are a few that keep a Gallic flavour. Mecspliquer To mansplain. A mot-valise (portmanteau word) composed of mec (guy) and expliquer (to explain). Lourd Literally \u201cheavy\u201d, and generally used to mean tiresome, but now, in an adult-bamboozling plot twist, it means good, pleasing. C\u2019est du lourd or \u00e7a envoie du lourd = it is impressive. The verlan (backwards slang) version, relou, is still used to mean annoying, or a pain. All clear? Clair comme de l\u2019eau de boudin (as clear as black pudding water, another great expression). PTDR P\u00e9t\u00e9 de rire, literally \u201cbroken with mirth\u201d, the French LOL. Although, of course, most French people use \u201cLOL\u201d. P\u00e9cho To seduce, get together with, hook up. Verlan of choper (to seize or get). J\u2019ai le seum I am displeased/angry/disappointed. J\u2019ai failli p\u00e9cho ce gars, mais il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 me mecspliquer ma propre th\u00e8se doctorale. C\u2019est archi-relou, j\u2019ai le seum. I nearly hooked up with this guy, but he started to mansplain my own PhD thesis to me. It\u2019s such a pain, I\u2019m gutted. \u2026 and how to sound like an intellectual Give your conversation a soup\u00e7on of Left Bank va-va-voom. Langage \u00e9pic\u00e8ne Also known as \u00e9criture inclusive, this controversial but increasingly popular typography style uses a point m\u00e9dian, a sort of decimal point, to create gender-neutral nouns. So a person reading this would be un\u00b7e lecteur\u00b7rice and the person writing it would be be un\u00b7e journaliste (or un\u00b7e idiot\u00b7e). Last year the French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, banned the point m\u00e9dian in official documents with an inflammatory declaration that \u201cthe masculine is a neutral form\u201d. Jupit\u00e9rien From Jupiter, king of the gods. Applied to Emmanuel Macron\u2019s presidential style (he used the term to contrast with the more down-to-earth approach of his predecessor, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande), it implies a degree of deliberate distance and grandeur and is now used by his critics to suggest he is haughty or arrogant. Telling a teenager to call you \u201cMonsieur le Pr\u00e9sident\u201d = jupit\u00e9rien. Cart\u00e9sien My go-to word to sound intelligent in French. Derived from philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes, it\u2019s used generically to mean \u201clogical\u201d or \u201crational\u201d. Du point de vue purement cart\u00e9sien (from a purely rational perspective) is a good (inflammatory) start to a sentence in a French argument. Charge mentale Mental load or burden. A hot topic of feminist debate following the publication last year of cartoonist Emma\u2019s Fallait Demander \u2013 You Should Have Asked \u2013 on women\u2019s experience of continually having to anticipate and meet their families\u2019 myriad needs. The Twitter account @chargementale collates some of the most egregious examples of paternal ineptitude encountered by doctors in French paediatrics. J\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 voir tout le temps des crabes autour de moi I started to see crabs around me all the time. Not an everyday expression, but handy if you wish to reproduce Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s ill-advised 1970s experiment with mescaline. Life as a French intellectual is a dangerous business.",

      "bodyText": "Trust Kate Bush, never one to explain, to complicate the straightforward lyrics collection. She doesn\u2019t annotate this anthology, unlike Neil Tennant\u2019s recent Faber edition. Instead, subtler direction follows an introduction by author David Mitchell, who wrote the spoken-word parts of Bush\u2019s 2014 Before the Dawn performances. Mitchell intermingles charming fannish detail with close textual analysis that illuminates familiar songs: it is God, he points out, not the devil, who allows the man and woman to exchange their sexual experiences on Running Up That Hill, an act of divinity rather than transgression. But Mitchell is wrong on one key point. \u201cKate\u2019s the opposite of a confessional singer-songwriter in the mould of Joni Mitchell during her Blue period,\u201d he asserts. \u201cYou don\u2019t learn much about Kate from her songs.\u201d Which begs the question of how we might know a songwriter. It\u2019s true that Bush\u2019s personal life is so opaque that an interview betraying her Netflix habits offered grounding intimacy. Another where she described Theresa May as \u201cthe best thing that\u2019s happened to us in a long time\u201d burst a bubble some fans were keen to preserve. More dispiriting than partisan matters was her opinion that \u201cit is great to have a woman in charge of the country\u201d. If Bush\u2019s songwriting tells us anything, it\u2019s that her understanding of gender and power is typically more complex. This understanding is one thread of How to Be Invisible, which splits selections from her catalogue across 10 newly curated sections, offering no clear framing devices. (Only Aerial\u2019s A Sky of Honey suite and Hounds of Love\u2019s second side, The Ninth Wave, remain intact.) Here is how we might find her, wedding Snowflake and Hounds of Love into a consideration of the perils of succumbing to love; contemplating alchemy and evolution from Cloudbusting, about a child losing faith in a parent, to Bertie, a tribute to how her son transformed her life. She addresses loss movingly: Aerial\u2019s A Coral Room finds the memory of her late mother in \u201cher little brown jug\u201d; The Fog, from The Sensual World, asks how to love when its objects are transient. Houdini and Get Out of My House bookend her strident interrogation in how to remain open to pleasure but protected from deception. Two sections dwell on gender. Joanni, her portrait of Joan of Arc, is juxtaposed with an indictment of masculine warmongering (Army Dreamers). Later, Bush explores masculine and feminine perspectives, contemplating desire (Reaching Out) and obligation (Night of the Swallow), never reaching trite conclusions. If there is one to be drawn from How to Be Invisible, it isn\u2019t that Bush is unknowable, but that life is: how much can we ever know about love, ourselves, the things we lose? She is never cowed by the uncertainty. Her songwriting suggests the only way to weather it is with curiosity; applying silliness as courageously as literary seriousness, balancing spiritual insight alongside unabashed carnality, domestic truth alongside fantasy, never concerned by contradictions. Desire runs wild in the final section: Mrs Bartolozzi\u2019s sexual laundry fantasia; the wily, windy Wuthering Heights. This headstrong pursuit has guided Bush. The question is not what we can learn about her, but what we might learn from following her lead. \u2022 How to Be Invisible by Kate Bush is published by Faber (\u00a314.99).

      "body": "<p>The Royal Academy of Engineering Africa prize, now in its fifth year, has shortlisted 16 African inventors from six countries to receive funding, training and mentoring for projects intended to revolutionise sectors from agriculture and science to women\u2019s health. The winner will be awarded \u00a325,000 and the three runners up will receive \u00a310,000 each.</p> <p>From smart gloves that turn sign language into audio speech, to water harvesting systems that change air into drinking water, five inventors on course to transform the continent for the better spoke to the Guardian about their innovations.</p> <h2>Kenya: Sign-IO</h2> <p>Roy Allela\u2019s six-year-old niece was born deaf. She found it difficult to communicate with her family, none of whom knew sign language. So Allela \u2013 a 25-year-old Kenyan technology evangelist who works for Intel and tutors data science at Oxford University \u2013 invented smart gloves that convert sign language movements into audio speech.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aaa377180fb34cc8ae11aabf743dfa2660c19cf4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaa377180fb34cc8ae11aabf743dfa2660c19cf4/0_0_7360_4907/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roy Allela is developing a glove that translates sign language to speech via a bluetooth-enabled smartphone.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roy Allela has developed a glove that translates sign language to speech via a bluetooth-enabled smartphone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brett Eloff/Royal Academy of Engineering</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The gloves \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.royallela.com/iot/sign-language-glove/\">named Sign-IO</a> \u2013 have flex sensors stitched on to each finger. The sensors quantify the bend of the fingers and process the letter being signed. The gloves are paired via Bluetooth to a mobile phone application that Allela also developed, which then vocalises the letters.</p> <p>\u201cMy niece wears the gloves, pairs them to her phone or mine, then starts signing and I\u2019m able to understand what she\u2019s saying,\u201d says Allela. \u201cLike all sign language users, she\u2019s very good at lip reading, so she doesn\u2019t need me to sign back.\u201d</p> <p>Allela piloted the gloves at a special needs school in rural Migori county, south-west Kenya, where feedback helped inform one of the most important aspects of the gloves: the speed at which the language is converted into audio.</p> <p>\u201cPeople speak at different speeds and it\u2019s the same with people who sign: some are really fast, others are slow, so we integrated that into the mobile application so that it\u2019s comfortable for anyone to use it.\u201d</p> <p>Users can also set the language, gender and pitch of the vocalisation through the app, with accuracy results averaging 93%, says Allela. Perhaps most importantly, the gloves can be packaged in any style the user wants, whether that\u2019s a princess glove or a Spider-Man one, he says. \u201cIt fights the stigma associated with being deaf and having a speech impediment. If the gloves look cool, every kid will want to know why you have them on.\u201d</p> <p>The gloves recently won the hardware trailblazer award from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and Allela is using the prize money to land more accurate vocal predictions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf73911a10238bb41c7d9c3729582fa3f07bfa9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf73911a10238bb41c7d9c3729582fa3f07bfa9c/0_0_7360_4907/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sign-IO app, which vocalises letters signed by the person wearing the gloves.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sign-IO app, which vocalises words signed by the person wearing the gloves.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brett Eloff/Royal Academy of Engineering</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His goal is to place at least two pairs of gloves in every special needs school in Kenya, and believes they could be used to help the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/deafness-and-hearing-loss\">34 million children worldwide who suffer disabling hearing loss</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI was trying to envision how my niece\u2019s life would be if she had the same opportunities as everyone else in education, employment, all aspects of life,\u201d says Allela.</p> <p>\u201cThe general public in Kenya doesn\u2019t understand sign language so when she goes out, she always needs a translator. Picture over the long term that dependency, how much that plagues or impairs her progress in life \u2026 when it affects you personally, you see how hard people have it in life. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve really strived to develop this project to completion.\u201d</p> <h2>South Africa: Pelebox smart lockers</h2> <p>When Neo Hutiri was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2014, the South African engineer was forced to spend three hours every two weeks waiting at his local clinic just to collect his medication. Queuing alongside patients requiring chronic therapy for health issues ranging from cancer to Aids, Hutiri wondered how he could apply technology to the problem and ease the burden for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica\">South Africa</a>\u2019s overrun public hospitals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"77180d96b794b7fdb7a1800bcec13f288958a211\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77180d96b794b7fdb7a1800bcec13f288958a211/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neo Hutiri with his Pelebox smart locker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neo Hutiri with his Pelebox smart locker, which is designed to cut down the amount of time that patients have to wait for their medication.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Oatway/Royal Academy of Engineering</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe have the biggest antiretroviral [ARV] therapy programme in the world: over 4.6m patients receive ARVs and with chronic therapy treatments like this you have to visit the facility every month to receive medication,\u201d says Hutiri.</p> <p>\u201cIt dawned on me that patients are spending a lot of time \u2013 4.3m man hours in total every month \u2013 just waiting in queues. So my initial hypothesis was to take patients\u2019 waiting time from three hours to under two minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Hutiri\u2019s first move was to automate the filing system as much as possible by designing the <a href=\"https://www.pelebox.com/locker.html\">Pelebox</a> (<em>pele</em> for fast in Setswana), a smart locker that acts as a self-service kiosk. The locker is stocked by health workers, who scan a patient\u2019s medication into a specialised cubicle. The number of the locker and a one-time pin are sent directly to the patient\u2019s mobile phone, with the pin allowing the user to open the locker.</p> <p>South Africa\u2019s pharmaceutical council was intrigued by the Pelebox, but needed reassurance that the right medications would be delivered to the right patients, every single time. Hutiri piloted the project in Pretoria last year and was overjoyed at the results: 4,700 medications were delivered at a 100% success rate \u2013 and with an average collection time of under 36 seconds, says Hutiri.</p> <p>The 30-year-old entrepreneur has now signed a contract with the department of health to roll the lockers out in eight of South Africa\u2019s nine provinces, a feat he is hugely proud of.</p> <p>\u201cEighty-three percent of the South African population relies on state-funded care \u2013 my parents are within that population and on long-term medication \u2013 but they get short-handed because there isn\u2019t enough of an incentive for entrepreneurs in my sector to serve them as they tend to be low-income,\u201d says Hutiri.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to design something that you could place as easily in [the affluent area of] Sandton as in a township. I wanted the product to stand out because then the patients feel a high degree of pride, they think: \u2018This product was designed for me\u2019. When you treat people with respect, they pass that respect on to others.\u201d</p> <h2>Uganda: <strong>The Vertical Farm</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/19/kampala-uganda-rooftop-farming-vertical-gardening-urbanisation\">More than two-thirds</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/uganda\">Uganda</a>\u2019s population engages in farming, but rapid population growth in the capital, Kampala, means that not everyone who would like to grow their own fruit and veg has the space or land to do so.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"22ca65f4299a7179d20798e31073facf69d5100d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22ca65f4299a7179d20798e31073facf69d5100d/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Matovu with his Vertical Farm\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Matovu with his Vertical Farm, designed to hold up to 200 plants.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Oatway/Royal Academy of Engineering</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was the issue faced by Paul Matovu, who was born into a family of 20 children and raised for a short time by his grandparents in rural Uganda, where he learned all about growing crops. After returning to Kampala as a cash-strapped university student, he began looking for space-saving ways to grow his own food. His solution was the \u201cfarm in a box\u201d, a sustainably sourced timber box measuring 90cm wide by 90cm high that can hold up to 200 plants.</p> <p>The farms currently retail at 300,000 shillings (\u00a364), a high price for the average Ugandan, says Matovu, but as the boxes produce food worth 1.29m shillings (\u00a3275) every year, costs can be quickly recouped. The farms also have a wormery in their middle to compost household waste, the castings of which can then be used to fertilise the crops, helping to keep inputs low but still organic, he says.</p> <p>\u201cOur goal is to roll out the farms to the wealthy, because they do not mind how expensive the boxes are, and to produce three to five farms per day,\u201d says Matovu. \u201cThen we can subsidise sales to the poor.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cddc0696780e9b15415d0bf967aaf7b0abd50e36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cddc0696780e9b15415d0bf967aaf7b0abd50e36/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Vertical Farm Box\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The farm boxes have a wormery in their middle to compost household waste, which can then be used to fertilise the crops.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Oatway/Royal Academy of Engineering</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Kenya: Chanjo Plus</h2> <p>In 2015, Kenyan Collince Oluoch was working as a community health worker in Nairobi, knocking door-to-door to register children for a national immunisation drive. The work was tedious and difficult: every volunteer was required to register 200 children, but because some families were at work or out shopping or had simply moved away, the targets couldn\u2019t always be met.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2faaab2785385dcefd780d20023369659219be1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2faaab2785385dcefd780d20023369659219be1c/0_0_7292_4861/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Collince Oluoch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Collince Oluoch\u2019s mobile platform helps improve the identification and registration of children targeted for life-saving vaccinations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brett Eloff/Royal Academy of Engineering</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Oluoch, 27, was faced with a choice: to invent names of children to meet the target (as many other health workers were doing), or to modify the existing pen-and-paper registration system into a digital database. He opted for the latter, and in 2016 built <a href=\"https://www.chanjoplus.com/\">Chanjo Plus</a>, an online vaccination platform that could be accessed by health clinics and hospitals across the country.</p> <p>\u201cThe initial plan was to have an accountable platform to put the faces behind the numbers,\u201d says Oluoch. \u201cWe have universal health coverage in Kenya and the aim is that by 2030 we will <a href=\"http://www.ke.undp.org/content/kenya/en/home/presscenter/pressreleases/2016/leave-no-one-behind--kenya-government-gives-road-map-to-implemen.html\">leave no one behind</a>. But how do you leave no one behind if you don\u2019t even know who everyone is?\u201d</p> <p>The database uses information compiled by community health workers to build a digital identity for each child, with details on which vaccinations were given and when and where they were given. These records can then be pulled up by any public health clinic anywhere, making it easy to identify which children are falling through the immunisation gaps and provide real-time data on vaccination drives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74b6d48336ee25ee0e24451c597bd86f7a5d13e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74b6d48336ee25ee0e24451c597bd86f7a5d13e7/0_0_7280_4853/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chanjo Plus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Across sub-Saharan Africa, one in five children still don\u2019t have access to life-saving vaccines.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brett Eloff/Royal Academy of Engineering</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chanjo Plus has so far enrolled 10,000 children at three clinics in Nairobi, and aims to scale up with the ministry of health to target the <a href=\"http://www.awcfs.org/index.php/component/k2/item/662-kenyan-children-set-to-benefit-from-a-new-vaccine\">1.5 million children</a> born in Kenya every year, says Oluoch.

      "bodyText": "The Royal Academy of Engineering Africa prize, now in its fifth year, has shortlisted 16 African inventors from six countries to receive funding, training and mentoring for projects intended to revolutionise sectors from agriculture and science to women\u2019s health. The winner will be awarded \u00a325,000 and the three runners up will receive \u00a310,000 each. From smart gloves that turn sign language into audio speech, to water harvesting systems that change air into drinking water, five inventors on course to transform the continent for the better spoke to the Guardian about their innovations. Kenya: Sign-IO Roy Allela\u2019s six-year-old niece was born deaf. She found it difficult to communicate with her family, none of whom knew sign language. So Allela \u2013 a 25-year-old Kenyan technology evangelist who works for Intel and tutors data science at Oxford University \u2013 invented smart gloves that convert sign language movements into audio speech. The gloves \u2013 named Sign-IO \u2013 have flex sensors stitched on to each finger. The sensors quantify the bend of the fingers and process the letter being signed. The gloves are paired via Bluetooth to a mobile phone application that Allela also developed, which then vocalises the letters. \u201cMy niece wears the gloves, pairs them to her phone or mine, then starts signing and I\u2019m able to understand what she\u2019s saying,\u201d says Allela. \u201cLike all sign language users, she\u2019s very good at lip reading, so she doesn\u2019t need me to sign back.\u201d Allela piloted the gloves at a special needs school in rural Migori county, south-west Kenya, where feedback helped inform one of the most important aspects of the gloves: the speed at which the language is converted into audio. \u201cPeople speak at different speeds and it\u2019s the same with people who sign: some are really fast, others are slow, so we integrated that into the mobile application so that it\u2019s comfortable for anyone to use it.\u201d Users can also set the language, gender and pitch of the vocalisation through the app, with accuracy results averaging 93%, says Allela. Perhaps most importantly, the gloves can be packaged in any style the user wants, whether that\u2019s a princess glove or a Spider-Man one, he says. \u201cIt fights the stigma associated with being deaf and having a speech impediment. If the gloves look cool, every kid will want to know why you have them on.\u201d The gloves recently won the hardware trailblazer award from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and Allela is using the prize money to land more accurate vocal predictions. His goal is to place at least two pairs of gloves in every special needs school in Kenya, and believes they could be used to help the 34 million children worldwide who suffer disabling hearing loss. \u201cI was trying to envision how my niece\u2019s life would be if she had the same opportunities as everyone else in education, employment, all aspects of life,\u201d says Allela. \u201cThe general public in Kenya doesn\u2019t understand sign language so when she goes out, she always needs a translator. Picture over the long term that dependency, how much that plagues or impairs her progress in life \u2026 when it affects you personally, you see how hard people have it in life. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve really strived to develop this project to completion.\u201d South Africa: Pelebox smart lockers When Neo Hutiri was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2014, the South African engineer was forced to spend three hours every two weeks waiting at his local clinic just to collect his medication. Queuing alongside patients requiring chronic therapy for health issues ranging from cancer to Aids, Hutiri wondered how he could apply technology to the problem and ease the burden for South Africa\u2019s overrun public hospitals. \u201cWe have the biggest antiretroviral [ARV] therapy programme in the world: over 4.6m patients receive ARVs and with chronic therapy treatments like this you have to visit the facility every month to receive medication,\u201d says Hutiri. \u201cIt dawned on me that patients are spending a lot of time \u2013 4.3m man hours in total every month \u2013 just waiting in queues. So my initial hypothesis was to take patients\u2019 waiting time from three hours to under two minutes.\u201d Hutiri\u2019s first move was to automate the filing system as much as possible by designing the Pelebox (pele for fast in Setswana), a smart locker that acts as a self-service kiosk. The locker is stocked by health workers, who scan a patient\u2019s medication into a specialised cubicle. The number of the locker and a one-time pin are sent directly to the patient\u2019s mobile phone, with the pin allowing the user to open the locker. South Africa\u2019s pharmaceutical council was intrigued by the Pelebox, but needed reassurance that the right medications would be delivered to the right patients, every single time. Hutiri piloted the project in Pretoria last year and was overjoyed at the results: 4,700 medications were delivered at a 100% success rate \u2013 and with an average collection time of under 36 seconds, says Hutiri. The 30-year-old entrepreneur has now signed a contract with the department of health to roll the lockers out in eight of South Africa\u2019s nine provinces, a feat he is hugely proud of. \u201cEighty-three percent of the South African population relies on state-funded care \u2013 my parents are within that population and on long-term medication \u2013 but they get short-handed because there isn\u2019t enough of an incentive for entrepreneurs in my sector to serve them as they tend to be low-income,\u201d says Hutiri. \u201cI wanted to design something that you could place as easily in [the affluent area of] Sandton as in a township. I wanted the product to stand out because then the patients feel a high degree of pride, they think: \u2018This product was designed for me\u2019. When you treat people with respect, they pass that respect on to others.\u201d Uganda: The Vertical Farm More than two-thirds of Uganda\u2019s population engages in farming, but rapid population growth in the capital, Kampala, means that not everyone who would like to grow their own fruit and veg has the space or land to do so. This was the issue faced by Paul Matovu, who was born into a family of 20 children and raised for a short time by his grandparents in rural Uganda, where he learned all about growing crops. After returning to Kampala as a cash-strapped university student, he began looking for space-saving ways to grow his own food. His solution was the \u201cfarm in a box\u201d, a sustainably sourced timber box measuring 90cm wide by 90cm high that can hold up to 200 plants. The farms currently retail at 300,000 shillings (\u00a364), a high price for the average Ugandan, says Matovu, but as the boxes produce food worth 1.29m shillings (\u00a3275) every year, costs can be quickly recouped. The farms also have a wormery in their middle to compost household waste, the castings of which can then be used to fertilise the crops, helping to keep inputs low but still organic, he says. \u201cOur goal is to roll out the farms to the wealthy, because they do not mind how expensive the boxes are, and to produce three to five farms per day,\u201d says Matovu. \u201cThen we can subsidise sales to the poor.\u201d Kenya: Chanjo Plus In 2015, Kenyan Collince Oluoch was working as a community health worker in Nairobi, knocking door-to-door to register children for a national immunisation drive. The work was tedious and difficult: every volunteer was required to register 200 children, but because some families were at work or out shopping or had simply moved away, the targets couldn\u2019t always be met. Oluoch, 27, was faced with a choice: to invent names of children to meet the target (as many other health workers were doing), or to modify the existing pen-and-paper registration system into a digital database. He opted for the latter, and in 2016 built Chanjo Plus, an online vaccination platform that could be accessed by health clinics and hospitals across the country. \u201cThe initial plan was to have an accountable platform to put the faces behind the numbers,\u201d says Oluoch. \u201cWe have universal health coverage in Kenya and the aim is that by 2030 we will leave no one behind. But how do you leave no one behind if you don\u2019t even know who everyone is?\u201d The database uses information compiled by community health workers to build a digital identity for each child, with details on which vaccinations were given and when and where they were given. These records can then be pulled up by any public health clinic anywhere, making it easy to identify which children are falling through the immunisation gaps and provide real-time data on vaccination drives. Chanjo Plus has so far enrolled 10,000 children at three clinics in Nairobi, and aims to scale up with the ministry of health to target the 1.5 million children born in Kenya every year, says Oluoch. He then hopes it can be a platform used across sub-Saharan Africa, where one in five children still don\u2019t have access to life-saving vaccines. \u201cPeople are still dying because of measles, polio, diarrhoea, and pneumonia \u2013 diseases that can be prevented and should not be causing deaths now. Getting every child access to vaccines translates into healthy lives for families: it means poverty reduction and greater access to education.\u201d Kenya: Majik Water When Beth Koigi moved into her university dormitory in eastern Kenya, she was horrified that the water coming out of the tap was filthy and laden with bacteria. Within months, she had built her first filter and was soon selling filters to others. When drought hit in 2016 and water restrictions saw Koigi\u2019s water supply turned off entirely, she began thinking about water scarcity and its relation to climate change. \u201cGoing for months without any tap water became a very bad situation,\u201d she says. \u201cWhere I used to live, we didn\u2019t get any tap water at all, so even doing simple things like going to the toilet \u2013 I would go to the mall instead. Having no water at all is worse than just having unpurified water, so I started thinking about a way to not have to rely on the council.\u201d While on a four-month programme at the Silicon Valley-based thinktank Singularity University, Koigi, 27, joined up with two other women \u2013 American environmental scientist Anastasia Kaschenko and British economist Clare Sewell \u2013 to create Majik Water, which captures water from the air and converts it into drinking water using solar technology. The device \u2013 which won first prize this year at the EDF Africa awards \u2013 could provide a solution for the 1.8 billion people predicted to have a shortage of water by 2025, according to the UN, says Kaschenko. \u201cThere\u2019s an interesting relationship between climate change and the water in the atmosphere,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s six times more water in the air than in all the rivers in the world. With every 1F increase in temperature, water begins to evaporate on the ground but increases by about 4% in the atmosphere, and that\u2019s water that\u2019s not being tapped.\u201d Majik Water \u2013 from the Swahili maji for water and \u201ck\u201d for kuna (harvest) \u2013 uses desiccants such as silica gels to draw water from the air. The gels are then heated up with solar power to release the water. The current system can generate up to 10 litres of filtered water per day, with the team looking to scale up to 100-litre systems at a cost of only \u00a30.08 per 10 litres. The solar panels used for the prototype are the most expensive input on the device, says Koigi, who is looking for ways to drive those costs down.",

      "body": "<p>Margaret Ferguson\u2019s family home on the Isle of Lewis was crowded with portraits. There were more than a hundred, and each was of a man looking out from the canvas. Veterans of the first world war, each man drowned on the same night, on the same boat, a short distance from safety.</p> <p>In heavy seas and a pitch-black night, an overcrowded steam yacht taking them home on leave, the Iolaire, struck a treacherous reef known as the Beasts of Holm in the early hours of New Year\u2019s Day 1919. They were barely a mile from Stornoway harbour and 50 yards from the shore, and of the 280 men on board, only 79 survived.</p> <p>It remains the UK\u2019s worst peacetime maritime disaster since the sinking of the Titanic \u2013 and is being marked by an official ceremony on Tuesday. Yet a century on, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/08/stornoway-remembrance-day-commemorations-scotland-world-war-one-iolaire\">the Iolaire story</a> is barely known beyond the Western Isles, despite its scale and horror.</p> <p>Its memory was suppressed too for generations on Lewis: every family, in a still tightly knit community, was either directly affected or knew someone who had died.

The tears are just below the surface,\u201d Ferguson said.</p> <p>Ferguson, a painter and a widely respected family doctor on Lewis for the last 30 years, said she felt compelled to make the portraits, using black and white family photographs and an archived roll of honour from the Stornoway Gazette, published in the 1920s.

They were propped up on furniture, hung from walls, stacked against walls. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking in the family, saying that there are so many ghosts in the house,\u201d she said. \u201cMy father finds it very difficult to go into the room with them.\u201d</p> <p>As she worked on each image, \u201cI kept thinking I was honouring this man and what he went through, and his family,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I got a bit upset towards the end. It was a very intense experience, especially when I paint the eyes. It feels as if he\u2019s in the room with you.\u201d</p> <p>Ian Stephen, a poet and former Stornoway coastguard whose career began in a coastguard station overlooking the Beasts of Holm, believes everyone on Lewis knows the stories.</p> <p>There are accounts of drenched, numb survivors immediately walking home across the moors in the storm, too traumatised to wait for help; of women who rushed to the shore to find their sons\u2019 and brothers\u2019 inert bodies among the rocks or surf, their baggage and presents strewn over the sand; of the stream of coffins being taken by horse and cart to be buried every day throughout the following week.</p> <p>His great-uncle, John Smith, was one of those who died. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t talked about much. We were just aware there was a connection to the Iolaire. It\u2019s only recently that it sunk home that was my grandfather\u2019s brother,\u201d Stephen said.</p> <p>\u201cPart of the reason for the silence is the enormity of the tragedy; having lived through that hell [of war], they were so close to the shore.\u201d</p> <p>All the men had spent the war at sea, on minesweepers, battlecruisers and destroyers. Some had already survived sinkings under enemy fire. Many, often volunteers who had joined the naval reserve, had navigated the narrow channel where the Iolaire struck the rocks as fishermen in civilian life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bc388edf739354e39f70aa45bfc10f1c0069ef2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bc388edf739354e39f70aa45bfc10f1c0069ef2/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A monument on the Beasts of Holm reef\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A monument on the Beasts of Holm, the reef where disaster struck.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the disaster had one hero, John Finlay Macleod, a boat builder from Ness who was on board the Iolaire that night. He saved nearly 40 lives by diving into the churning seas with a rope, then used it to pull a thick hawser taut between the yacht and the beach as a lifeline for survivors.</p> <p>Malcolm Macdonald, the co-author of an authoritative new study of the disaster, <a href=\"http://www.hebrideswriter.com/2018/10/04/the-darkest-dawn-the-story-of-the-iolaire-tragedy/\">The Darkest Dawn</a>, believes the community-wide trauma was amplified by the heavy wartime losses the Western Isles had already experienced, which in turn contributed to further waves of emigration and economic decline in the 1920s.</p> <p>Lewis and Harris, the two northern islands of the Western Isles, had a population of 34,600 in 1911. Macdonald estimates about 1,500 of those were killed during the war, and with another 201 lost on the Iolaire, that was an immense cumulative loss of young men and fathers.</p> <p>Although the official board of inquiry refused to find fault, Macdonald and Stephen believe the Iolaire\u2019s commander and navigating officer made colossal navigational errors, taking the wrong course and failing to correct it in time, in a force 8 gale.</p> <p>Now aged 70, Macdonald, whose grandfather was among those who died, recalls it was never discussed when he was a child but he has recently been touring schools to discuss his book. \u201cEveryone seems to want to open up and hear the full story. Young children at the schools I have spoken at all sit silently, listening, but then the questions, questions, questions keep pouring out,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Margaret Ferguson\u2019s family home on the Isle of Lewis was crowded with portraits. There were more than a hundred, and each was of a man looking out from the canvas. Veterans of the first world war, each man drowned on the same night, on the same boat, a short distance from safety. In heavy seas and a pitch-black night, an overcrowded steam yacht taking them home on leave, the Iolaire, struck a treacherous reef known as the Beasts of Holm in the early hours of New Year\u2019s Day 1919. They were barely a mile from Stornoway harbour and 50 yards from the shore, and of the 280 men on board, only 79 survived. It remains the UK\u2019s worst peacetime maritime disaster since the sinking of the Titanic \u2013 and is being marked by an official ceremony on Tuesday. Yet a century on, the Iolaire story is barely known beyond the Western Isles, despite its scale and horror. Its memory was suppressed too for generations on Lewis: every family, in a still tightly knit community, was either directly affected or knew someone who had died. Until quite recently, it was rarely, if ever, discussed. \u201cIt is very, very deep within us. In fact, when I think about it, I get a tightness in my chest. The tears are just below the surface,\u201d Ferguson said. Ferguson, a painter and a widely respected family doctor on Lewis for the last 30 years, said she felt compelled to make the portraits, using black and white family photographs and an archived roll of honour from the Stornoway Gazette, published in the 1920s. Her great-great uncle, Alexander Mackenzie, is among them. She stored the pictures in her family\u2019s uninhabited ancestral home on the Point peninsula, which overlooks the seas the Iolaire sailed that night, before being exhibited in Stornoway from 31 December until 2 March, one of a series of commemorative events to mark the centenary of the disaster. In Stornoway harbour, 280 illuminated columns are fixed on to the seabed, sketching the outline of the Iolaire\u2019s hull: 201 of those columns have been lit in blue for those who died while 79 remain white for those who survived. Designed by Malcolm MacLean and Torcuil Crichton, the lighting effect on the artwork, named She\u00f2l an Iolaire, Gaelic for \u201cthe Iolaire sailed\u201d, changes as the tide comes in and recedes. The commemorations, among the last being staged to mark the centenary of the first world war, include a New Year\u2019s Day service overlooking the site, which will be attended by Prince Charles and Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister. Ferguson believes Lewis has begun to come to terms with the tragedy; even so, the portraits were kept temporarily in the family home because no one lives there. They were propped up on furniture, hung from walls, stacked against walls. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking in the family, saying that there are so many ghosts in the house,\u201d she said. \u201cMy father finds it very difficult to go into the room with them.\u201d As she worked on each image, \u201cI kept thinking I was honouring this man and what he went through, and his family,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I got a bit upset towards the end. It was a very intense experience, especially when I paint the eyes. It feels as if he\u2019s in the room with you.\u201d Ian Stephen, a poet and former Stornoway coastguard whose career began in a coastguard station overlooking the Beasts of Holm, believes everyone on Lewis knows the stories. There are accounts of drenched, numb survivors immediately walking home across the moors in the storm, too traumatised to wait for help; of women who rushed to the shore to find their sons\u2019 and brothers\u2019 inert bodies among the rocks or surf, their baggage and presents strewn over the sand; of the stream of coffins being taken by horse and cart to be buried every day throughout the following week. His great-uncle, John Smith, was one of those who died. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t talked about much. We were just aware there was a connection to the Iolaire. It\u2019s only recently that it sunk home that was my grandfather\u2019s brother,\u201d Stephen said. \u201cPart of the reason for the silence is the enormity of the tragedy; having lived through that hell [of war], they were so close to the shore.\u201d All the men had spent the war at sea, on minesweepers, battlecruisers and destroyers. Some had already survived sinkings under enemy fire. Many, often volunteers who had joined the naval reserve, had navigated the narrow channel where the Iolaire struck the rocks as fishermen in civilian life. But the disaster had one hero, John Finlay Macleod, a boat builder from Ness who was on board the Iolaire that night. He saved nearly 40 lives by diving into the churning seas with a rope, then used it to pull a thick hawser taut between the yacht and the beach as a lifeline for survivors. Malcolm Macdonald, the co-author of an authoritative new study of the disaster, The Darkest Dawn, believes the community-wide trauma was amplified by the heavy wartime losses the Western Isles had already experienced, which in turn contributed to further waves of emigration and economic decline in the 1920s. Lewis and Harris, the two northern islands of the Western Isles, had a population of 34,600 in 1911. Macdonald estimates about 1,500 of those were killed during the war, and with another 201 lost on the Iolaire, that was an immense cumulative loss of young men and fathers. Although the official board of inquiry refused to find fault, Macdonald and Stephen believe the Iolaire\u2019s commander and navigating officer made colossal navigational errors, taking the wrong course and failing to correct it in time, in a force 8 gale. Now aged 70, Macdonald, whose grandfather was among those who died, recalls it was never discussed when he was a child but he has recently been touring schools to discuss his book. \u201cEveryone seems to want to open up and hear the full story. Young children at the schools I have spoken at all sit silently, listening, but then the questions, questions, questions keep pouring out,\u201d he said.",

A Guardian investigation revealed how Newcross Healthcare, which made \u00a321m in pre-tax profits in 2017, not only failed to give sick pay to carers or nurses but also issued punitive fines when unwell workers cancelled shifts without 24 hours\u2019 notice. Now a whistleblower who worked as a business centre manager for the firm has described an intense sales environment at the company, which employs 7,000 staff providing temporary nurses and care workers for hospitals and residential care homes. The whistleblower, who quit the firm in 2018, alleges: Regional managers pressured branches to impose fines on sick employees, even if they knew absences were genuine. Care homes were forced to send home sick agency staff who had turned up because they were afraid of being docked wages. Managers were put up in a five-star hotel in Gibraltar each year for a \u201clavish\u201d sales bash where awards would be given out. Managers were tasked with repeatedly cold-calling care and nursing homes to book in shifts for agency workers, with a target of achieving 3,000 hours of shifts a week. The industry watchdog, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), has said it has contacted Newcross and is considering taking action. It said: \u201cIt is essential that providers take all necessary steps to ensure that people receiving care are not put at risk.\u201d The whistleblower, who did not wish to be named, was one of around 60 business centre managers at branches around the country tasked with filling thousands of hours of shifts a week for agency nurses and carers supplied to local homes and hospitals.

      "bodyText": "The midterm elections brought an end to a period of one-party rule in Washington. In January, Donald Trump will face a newly empowered House Democratic majority eager to take him on. The incoming Democratic committee chairs have vowed rigorous oversight of Trump and his administration. Armed with committee gavels, they will now have the power and resources to pursue investigations, issue subpoenas and compel testimony. Trump in response has threatened to adopt a \u201cwarlike\u201d posture, signaling a tumultuous end to an already-volatile first term. Here are the men and women most likely to torment the president. Elijah Cummings Incoming chair of the House committee on oversight and government reform As the ranking Democrat on the committee, Cummings has sat through his share of Republican-led investigations into the Obama administration. Now the outspoken 67-year-old will wield one of the most powerful gavels in Washington. The son of two former sharecroppers who moved from the south, Cummings was born and raised in Baltimore, a city he now represents in Congress. He practiced law and served for 14 years in the Maryland house of delegates before being elected to Congress in 1996. In January, Cummings will become one of the Democrats\u2019 chief investigators into the Trump administration. He describes his approach as having \u201ctwo tracks\u201d. One track will scrutinize the executive branch, including whether Trump has profited from the presidency; a decision to add a citizenship question to the US census; and hush payments made to women with whom Trump allegedly had affairs. A second track will focus on reforms such as overhauling the US postal service and lowering prescription drug prices. Cummings has been wary of calls to impeach Trump. Rather than issuing subpoenas \u201clike somebody\u2019s handing out candy on Halloween\u201d, the Democrat says he prefers a more judicious approach. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for retribution,\u201d Cummings told ABC News. \u201cLife is too short.\u201d Adam Schiff Incoming chair of the House permanent select committee on intelligence Schiff is one of Trump\u2019s most combative political opponents. Mocked by the president as \u201cLiddle Adam Schiff\u201d \u2013 a barb that was recently modified to \u201cLittle Adam Schitt\u201d \u2013 the California Democrat was at the center of the House\u2019s deeply partisan investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Schiff began his career as a prosecutor with the Los Angeles division of the US attorney\u2019s office in 1987. He gained prominence by prosecuting a case against the first FBI agent to be indicted for espionage against the United States. (The agent was convicted of passing classified information to the Soviet Union for money.) He was elected to Congress in 2000 after serving in the California state senate. Schiff, 58, is a leading attack dog on the Russia investigation and obstruction of justice. The Democrat has said he will examine whether Russia has financial leverage over the president through its investments in Trump\u2019s business empire, something Trump says would \u201ccross a red line\u201d. Schiff recently said: \u201cIf the president\u2019s business is trying to curry favor with the Kremlin, we can\u2019t ignore that.\u201d The congressman has also signaled that he will seek more information about whether Trump sought to obstruct the FBI\u2019s investigation into the president\u2019s dealings with Moscow when he fired its director James Comey. He also hasn\u2019t ruled out calling Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr, to testify in a public hearing. Jerrold Nadler Incoming chair of the House judiciary committee The New York Democrat, universally known as \u201cJerry\u201d, will chair the House judiciary committee, which has jurisdiction over key policy areas but will be watched closely for its role in any impeachment proceedings. Nadler\u2019s political career began in 1977 as a New York assemblyman while he was still attending Fordham Law School. He was elected to Congress in 1992, and represents Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side, Wall Street and parts of Brooklyn. Long before Trump came to Washington, he and Nadler sparred over a real estate venture proposed by Trump that Nadler forcefully opposed. In his book The America We Deserve, Trump later described Nadler as \u201cone of the most egregious hacks in contemporary politics\u201d. Known as a steady hand, Nadler had been careful about broaching the topic of impeachment, dismissing such discussions as \u201cpremature\u201d. However, in December Nadler said court filings stating that Trump directed Cohen to pay hush money \u201cwould be impeachable offenses\u201d. Nadler, 71, has outlined an expansive list of subjects his committee will scrutinize, including Russian interference in the 2016 election; the policy on separating immigrant families at the southern border; the justice department\u2019s failure to defend the Affordable Care Act; the allegations of sexual misconduct and perjury by the supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh; a rise in antisemitic and hate crime incidents since Trump\u2019s election, and the appointment of acting US attorney general Matthew Whitaker after the forced resignation of Jeff Sessions. Maxine Waters Incoming chair of the House financial services committee Waters, or \u201cAuntie Maxine\u201d as she is affectionately known by her supporters in the anti-Trump \u201cresistance\u201d movement, is a frequent target of the president. Insulted by Trump as \u201ccrazy\u201d and an \u201cextraordinarily low IQ person\u201d, the 80-year-old Democrat from California has earned her hard-charging reputation by fighting fire with fire. She has called Trump an \u201cimmoral, indecent, &amp; inhumane thug\u201d who \u201cloves Putin\u201d and \u201cgenuflects for Kim Jong-un\u201d. The verbal volleys may only get worse as she assumes the top spot on the House financial services committee next year. Waters has consistently demanded information about Trump\u2019s private bank dealings and possible connections to Russia. As chairwoman, she will have the power to demand answers from Trump\u2019s biggest lender, Deutsche Bank. She could also increase scrutiny on the nation\u2019s biggest banks and Wall Street. Waters has called for more regulation of banks and could use her power to slow efforts by the Trump administration to roll back regulations on the financial institutions. Waters was one of the first Democrats in Washington to call for the president\u2019s impeachment. She will be the first woman to chair the financial services committee. Richard Neal Incoming chair of the House ways and means committee As chairman of the powerful tax-writing committee, the long-serving Massachusetts Democrat is preparing to lead the fight for the release of Trump\u2019s tax returns. Neal told the Washington Post that he will start by requesting Trump voluntarily release his tax returns. In the likely event Trump does not acquiesce, Neal, 69, says he will file a legal request with the treasury department to release the returns to a select group of lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Neal expects the effort will ultimately end up in federal court. Neal will also use his perch to defend social security, Medicare and Medicaid, federal programs that have personal resonance with him. His parents died when he was young, and Neal and his sisters relied on social security survivor benefit checks. He was elected to Congress in 1988 after serving as a city councilor and mayor of Springfield. He became the ranking Democrat on the committee in 2016. An outspoken opponent of the Republican tax overhaul, Neal has said he also plans to convene hearings on tax policy as well as healthcare and trade.",

In 2016, when it seemed that Facebook\u2019s challenges were still largely technological, he set out to build his own smart home system.

      "bodyText": "When Mark Zuckerberg began his annual \u201cpersonal challenges\u201d in 2009, he set the bar pretty low: he dressed like an adult every day for a year. Subsequent challenges were squarely in the realm of achievable New Year\u2019s resolutions, from reading a book every two weeks and running a mile a day to starting to learn Mandarin and sending thank you notes. But as Zuckerberg has transitioned his public image from the kid cosplaying as a business executive to the no-longer-quite-a-kid cosplaying as a statesman, his personal challenges have become something of a bellwether for how he is thinking about Facebook\u2019s future. In 2016, when it seemed that Facebook\u2019s challenges were still largely technological, he set out to build his own smart home system. In 2017, when political polarization was still being chalked up to filter bubbles, he embarked on a road trip around the US. And in 2018, when fake news and foreign interference were dominating headlines, he promised to buckle down and \u201cfocus on fixing\u201d all of the various \u201cissues\u201d that had left the one-time prodigy looking more and more like a pariah. Twelve months later, it seems that for the first time, Zuckerberg has failed to meet his goal. Not only has he not fixed Facebook, the list of problems with the social network has grown so long that it\u2019s getting harder to find people who think the company is even fixable. So this year, we asked a number of writers, technologists, politicians, activists and comedians to answer two questions: What do you predict Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s 2019 personal challenge will be? What do you think Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s 2019 personal challenge should be? Here\u2019s what they said \u2026 Ellen Pao, CEO and co-founder of Project Include Will be: Spend time with people he wants to connect with, perhaps employees or maybe his family. Should be: Hire more people of color at the executive level, reporting directly to him. Bring more people of color, especially women of color, on to the Facebook board \u2026 Learn about the history of harassment on the internet over the past decade and a half from people targeted, from Pizzagate to Gamergate \u2013 and pay them for their time. Meet with the people in Myanmar and in India who have been victims of harassment from Facebook and WhatsApp. Tom Watson, deputy leader of the Labour party Will be: Continue to evade parliamentary scrutiny and personal responsibility for Facebook\u2019s problems. Should be: Have a productive life having resigned from the company he founded to leave a new leadership team to clean up his mess. Anand Giridharadas, author of Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World Will be: Some trivial act of personal development that gives him an aura of moral growth without actually reforming the troubled mind and soul of his that helped put a demagogue in charge of America. Should be: Resigning from Facebook \u2013 and bringing Sheryl Sandberg with him, so she can spend all her time convincing women that patriarchy is really just a posture problem. Then he should reorient his charitable foundation. It should stop trying to end all disease and refocus on healing the plague that Facebook has become. It should stop trying to transform education and refocus on educating billionaire techies with huge power but limited moral imaginations. Jessica Powell, author and former Google executive Will be: A further commitment this year to improving the platform. Should be: Mark would have an easier time tackling Facebook\u2019s problems if he could better understand them on a human level \u2013 not as data points. Just as he set off two years ago to visit all 50 states, he should set out to visit 50 people who were personally affected by all the bullying, hate speech, ethnic cleansing and live-streamed suicides that have occurred on his platform. Ro Khanna, congressman from Silicon Valley Will be: Being more willing to admit error. Should be: Building social media tools that will strengthen democracy. Siva Vaidhyanathan, author of Anti-Social Media Will be: Trying to learn yet another language in 2019. If he\u2019s self-aware in any way he will choose to master Burmese so he can better understand the genocide his platforms amplify. Should be: Understanding his own company. I could send him a substantial reading list of scholarship that assesses the influence of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp in the world. Zuckerberg could take a three-month sabbatical to digest all that work. Better than that, Zuckerberg could take a two-year sabbatical from Facebook, enroll at the University of Virginia, and finish his bachelor\u2019s degree under my direction. That would serve him \u2013 and his company and all its users \u2013 better than just about anything else he could do. Matt Klinman, comedian Will be: To finally leave Facebook: \u201cIt\u2019s just not fun here any more, at first Facebook was about hanging out with my friends and sharing cool stuff. But now, most of my friends have quit and the ones that haven\u2019t are, no offense, just the most narcissistic crazy ones addicted to the fake positive reinforcement they get. I think about all the people in my life who I actually respect and I\u2019m like \u2018I never see those people at Facebook any more.\u201d Should be: Spend the entire next year as one of those poor outsourced contractors who has to sit there for 10 hours a day looking at all the violent and pedophilic images people report. He should feel the trauma of being on the ground level of his giant editor-less libertarian media dystopia. Jillian York, free expression director at Electronic Frontier Foundation Will be: Something vague that won\u2019t require any real accountability, like \u201cdo better\u201d. Should be: Speaking for myself? Find a new job. Dennys Antonialli, executive director of InternetLab, Brazil Should be: Take local contexts into account when shaping global policies to regulate content. This will require a more meaningful engagement with civil society around the world: understanding their issues and listening to their concerns is the only way to make Facebook a safer and better place. Zuckerberg should listen to an activist every day. Rachel Coldicutt, CEO of doteveryone Will be: Working out how artificial intelligence can safeguard democracy. Should be: Breaking up Facebook into at least three smaller companies, while he steps away from the computer and focuses on learning something more low risk for the rest of humanity, like falconry maybe, or macram\u00e9. Leslie Miley, former CTO of Obama Foundation Will be: Work more closely with news organizations and public policy orgs to better understand the reach, scope and impact of Facebook\u2019s machinations. Should be: Resign and find a pursuit that will teach him humility and help him find his moral compass. Daphne Keller, director at Stanford Center for Internet and Society Will be: Something humble, modest, and quantifiable \u2013 like maybe \u201cspend a day in the shoes of a frontline employee in every major team at Facebook\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Laptops and phones, winter coats and scarves, a hubbub of different languages. A row of cameras sits on a bench. John Roberts of Fox News has a steely expression as he clutches a mic. Jim Acosta of CNN, press pass reinstated after his run-in with the president last year, speaks simultaneously to his own viewers: \u201cWe\u2019ll see how much time we have Sarah Sanders. As we\u2019ve seen in recent weeks, these briefings can end very quickly.\u201d Then a voice on the public-address system: \u201cThe press briefing will begin at 1.20pm. Thank you.\u201d The hundred-or-so journalists crammed into the seats and aisles erupt in knowing laughs and groans. Sanders eventually enters at 1.35pm. It will be the White House press secretary\u2019s sole briefing in the whole of November \u2013 a paltry total she will match in December. The question-and-answer session was described as must-see television in the early months of the Trump administration, gripping millions of viewers and earning the accolade of parody on the TV variety show Saturday Night Live. But now the daily press briefing is no more. It has effectively become a monthly press briefing, raising concerns that it might soon disappear altogether. \u201cThat would be a tragedy and a campaign point in 2020,\u201d said Anthony Scaramucci, who served as White House communications director for 11 days in 2017. \u201cI pray that that does not happen. For the president to be successful, you don\u2019t want that to be a campaign talking point in 2020. The American people intuitively know that there needs to be an open communication between the White House and the free press.\u201d The first official White House press secretary was George Akerson under President Herbert Hoover in 1929. In recent decades the position became best known to the outside world for the briefing, in which the press secretary stands at a podium and fields questions from reporters in a briefing room (formerly a swimming pool) in the west wing. Few have made such an explosive start as Sean Spicer, whose debut briefing in January 2017 included a tirade at the media and the now-infamous assertion about Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration: \u201cThis was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2013 period \u2013 both in person and around the globe.\u201d Spicer\u2019s briefings became a compulsive, car-crash spectacle. There was fluster, ill-fitting suits, gaffes such as \u201cHolocaust centres\u201d and Melissa McCarthy\u2019s deathless impression of him with motorised lectern on Saturday Night Live. Scaramucci said: \u201cThey were must-watch television because he made a decision that he was going to lie and so everyone knew he was lying. There was a contradiction to the press briefing. Every Spice Girl has a nickname. His was Liar Spice.\u201d When Spicer was replaced by Sarah Sanders, the ship steadied, even though the falsehoods and acrimonious exchanges did not. Briefings became scarcer and lost the old momentum. It was like a long-running TV series that had passed its prime but did not know when to quit.

The president normally hosts a flamboyant black-tie gala at his private Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach. But this year he\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/29/trump-white-house-shutdown-skip-mar-lago-new-years-gala/2439837002/\">rattling around</a> the White House in Washington, apparently waiting for a deal from Democrats to fund his promised wall on the border with Mexico - a deal that is not forthcoming. The federal government is now in its 10th day of being partially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/31/trump-mexico-border-wall-government-shutdown-funding\">shut down</a>, after Trump refused to back away from his demand for taxpayers\u2019 money for the wall and Congress declined to acquiesce. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bf80edd6b373d9505c69f5dd2adc37719bf66de\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bf80edd6b373d9505c69f5dd2adc37719bf66de/0_0_4134_2756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Donald Trump makes a statement on the possible government shutdown before signing criminal just reform legislation in the Oval Office of the White House, in Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Donald Trump makes a statement on the possible government shutdown before signing criminal just reform legislation in the Oval Office of the White House, in Washington.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1079763419908243456\">tweeted</a> earlier on New Year\u2019s Eve: \u201cI\u2019m in the Oval Office.

Putin visited the city to oversee rescue efforts.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ea7c99fdfba9b32d61a7666f7a9eeca9de0193f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ea7c99fdfba9b32d61a7666f7a9eeca9de0193f/0_287_6478_3888/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rescue workers at the site of an apartment building collapse in the city of Magnitogorsk.

From Samoa to Sydney to Santiago, it\u2019s been 20 hours of ringing in 2019. Who had the best fireworks? Is it ever worth donning a diaper to stand in Times Square? Just how embarrassing is it that Sydney projected 2018 onto the Harbour Bridge? Questions abound. For those of you on the west coast of the US, and in Hawaii, there\u2019s still 3 to 6 hours left of 2018. The rest of us are way out ahead in 2019. Happy New Year everyone, we hope you enjoyed it. And finally, pictures of the big moment from New York: From Toronto: And from Vina del Mar in Chile Here\u2019s the aftermath of Russell Crowe\u2019s party: While we wait for pictures to come in from the Americas, here\u2019s the best of Australia\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations Sorry, that earlier post should say \u201cHappy annually recurring day that carries no scientific significance whatsoever!\u201d Happy New Year to New York, Boston, Miami, Toronto, Havana, Bogota and Lima! Some pictures of New Year\u2019s Day in Japan \u2013 where people are visiting the Meiji Shrine in Tokyo. Half an hour until midnight on the US east coast, Toronto, Cuba, Venezuela and Peru. Here are the expectant crowds in New York, doing their best to cope with the rain. Earlier today, the US military deleted a New Year\u2019s tweet where they used a tenuous link to the Times Square ball to joke about dropping bombs. The tweet, from the official account of US Strategic Command, featured footage of a B-2 bomber dropping Massive Ordnance Penetrators \u2013 known as \u201cbunker busters\u201d. \u201cTimes Square tradition rings in the New Year by dropping the big ball,\u201d it said. \u201cIf ever needed, we are #ready to drop something much, much bigger.\u201d The account quickly deleted the tweet, and said sorry. In more unlikely pairings, Australian football legend Tim Cahill is hanging out with pop star Rita Ora. Happy New Year to Venezuala, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana and Nova Scotia, Canada! Here\u2019s the Arc de Triomphe, with accompanying laser show and techno beats. In other news, former wrestler Hulk Hogan is hanging out with pop star Dua Lipa. More phenomenal images from Brazil: Happy New Year from Kanye West. Three fantastic matching pictures from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: Frankfurt, Germany: And Rotterdam, The Netherlands: Happy New Year to Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Suriname! Here\u2019s something a lot better \u2013 the video wrap of London\u2019s celebrations: And for something even sadder, here\u2019s video game streamer Ninja \u2013 who is performing this year in Times Square \u2013 trying and completely failing to get the crowd to floss. \u201cI wanna see some movement,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing enough movement.\u201d Disneyland in Anaheim, California may have to cancel this year\u2019s fireworks. And meanwhile on the east coast, partygoers in New York are waiting in Times Square. It\u2019s raining, 7C (45F), and some of them can\u2019t even see the ball. Many Times Square revellers also wear adult diapers so they can get in early and grab the best spots \u2013 once you\u2019re in a cordoned off section, you can\u2019t get out until the ball drops. Here\u2019s a preview of events in California from Dani Anguiano: In California, residents are ringing in the new year with large celebrations in across the state. 200,000 are expected to gather along San Francisco\u2019s waterfront for midnight fireworks, while in Los Angeles revellers are flocking downtown for the city\u2019s annual countdown, which will feature musical performances and large displays of art from local schoolchildren. Southern California is experiencing chilly and blustery weather, which is expected to last into the new year, posing a challenge for spectators at celebratory events like Pasadena\u2019s 130th annual Rose parade. Off the coast, there were several reports of funnel clouds, including around San Diego. The National Weather Service said the clouds, despite their resemblance, were not tornadoes as that requires contact with the ground. Meanwhile, prominent Californians shared their memories of the year, and best wishes for 2019. Senator Kamala Harris, widely considered a 2020 presidential contender, highlighted Dr Christine Blasey Ford and increased representation of women in Congress. Harris and other prominent Democrats also used New Year\u2019s Eve to criticize Trump over the government shutdown, which will continue into 2019, and has been causing chaos at California\u2019s beloved national parks during the holiday season. Happy New Year to Brazil! Watch below for footage of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Copacabana beach. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has used his New Years message to extend a welcome to all \u201cone million EU citizens\u201d in the city. The Arc de Triomphe in Paris The Parthenon in Athens The Colosseum in Rome And here are (some of) the best pictures from across Europe. Berlin\u2019s Brandenburg Gate: The Balmoral Hotel clock in Edinburgh \u2013 just as it struck midnight: Fireworks over the Kremlin in Moscow: The pictures are in from London: In Sydney, last night\u2019s fireworks organisers are shaking their heads after they accidentally projected the wrong year onto the Sydney Harbour Bridge. As the clock struck 12 on the biggest New Year\u2019s celebration in Australia*, the iconic bridge lit up, 8.5 tonnes of fireworks flew over the Opera House...and two giant pylons read \u201cHappy New Year 2018!\u201d, instead of 2019. It\u2019s morning now, and revellers are sharing pictures of last night\u2019s embarrassing typo with glee. Sydney\u2019s harbourside fireworks are the city\u2019s biggest public event of the year, one of the earliest major fireworks in the world, and this year cost $5.8m. *sorry Melbourne Happy New Year! London\u2019s fireworks are live, here: More from New York, courtesy of Joanna Walters: Donald Trump is set for an unusually quiet, even lonely, New Year\u2019s Eve in a divided America. The president normally hosts a flamboyant black-tie gala at his private Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach. But this year he\u2019s rattling around the White House in Washington, apparently waiting for a deal from Democrats to fund his promised wall on the border with Mexico - a deal that is not forthcoming. The federal government is now in its 10th day of being partially shut down, after Trump refused to back away from his demand for taxpayers\u2019 money for the wall and Congress declined to acquiesce. He tweeted earlier on New Year\u2019s Eve: \u201cI\u2019m in the Oval Office. Democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for border security, including the wall\u2026\u201d The sound of presidential typing must have echoed off the walls, then rustled through the red, fake Christmas trees, into the political void. Trump is scheduled to do a TV interview on Fox News later in the evening, some time after 10PM local time (3AM GMT), when he is likely once again to try to blame his government shut down on the Democrats - and may possibly speak to his desolate New Year\u2019s Eve at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Perhaps later he\u2019ll curl up with a cheeseburger and re-read his own book The Art of the Deal. But the party will just be getting started at Mar-a-Lago, a little more subdued than usual as the divisive Trump presidency continues to upset many people, even in Florida. But according to one club member talking to Vanity Fair, it will be more pleasant for some without its traditional, larger-than-life host. Photos are in from Turkey. Nairobi is celebrating an \u201ceventful, memorable and meaningful\u201d year. There\u2019s just two hours to go until 2019, in the UK! Still time to finish writing those resolutions. Elsewhere in the world, the midnight bells just struck in Cairo, Athens, Bucharest and Johannesburg. Brussels, Madrid, Paris, Rome and Algiers will enjoy their last moments of 2018 in less than an hour. This year\u2019s Hogmanay celebrates the ties between Scotland and Europe as the UK prepares to leave the EU in 2019, its organisers have told the Press Association. Bands, DJs, street performers, dancers, acrobats and fire eaters from Scotland and mainland Europe are scheduled to perform at the street party, one of the largest in the world, which is running for several hours, until well after the midnight bells fall silent. Revellers can enjoy music across three stages, with Scottish favourite Gerry Cinnamon appearing on the Waverley stage, Judge Jules leading the DJ stage in Castle Street and Elephant Sessions set to take to the stage in South St David Street. At midnight, German band Meute will provide the soundtrack to the fireworks display from Edinburgh Castle while Eurodance outfit Snap! are set to perform on one of the stages in the first minutes of 2019. Meanwhile, Franz Ferdinand - supported by Metronomy and Free Love - will headline the Concert in the Gardens ahead of midnight at the foot of Castle Rock while some of the country\u2019s top ceilidh bands are to play at Ceilidh under the Castle. First in the queue to see Franz Ferdinand were Jessica Cassino, 37, from Brooklyn, New York, and 28-year-old Alina Entelis, from Israel. \u201cI love Franz Ferdinand. Edinburgh\u2019s beautiful, I love it,\u201d said Cassino. \u201cI\u2019ll be back next year.\u201d Entelis, who is currently studying in London, said: \u201cWhen I started looking at the Franz Ferdinand concert, I saw a bunch of other events going on. I was participating in the torchlight procession on Sunday and I loved it. \u201cI feel like Edinburgh is the best place to be on New Year\u2019s Eve right now. Everybody is jealous of me back home! I\u2019ve been here once before and I loved it, and I was really looking forward to coming back. I think it\u2019s magical and I\u2019ve recommended it to a bunch of my friends.\u201d The crowd featured first-time visitors, return visitors and those with family links to Scotland. It was the first time in Edinburgh for couple Myriam Malquin, 25, and David Maheo, 26, from Brittany in France. Maheo said: \u201cWe wanted to go to a European capital for New Year. We saw that there was a big party in Edinburgh, so we came. It\u2019s great. It\u2019s very interesting to see the castle, all the buildings.\u201d Georgina McGuire, 26, from Woking in Surrey, praised the friendliness of the local residents. \u201cI love Edinburgh - there are good vibes and lots of sparkle. Everyone is so friendly,\u201d she said. Michelle Rossiter, 30, a speech therapist from Sydney, currently working in London, said: \u201cMy heritage is from Scotland, my grandmother, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. \u201cWe\u2019ve already met some Scottish people, some Edinburgh locals, and they\u2019re all really friendly. I\u2019m looking forward to the concert. Sydney has some pretty good fireworks, and I am looking forward to fireworks over the castle, but the concert, definitely, is the main thing I\u2019m excited about.\u201d Scotland\u2019s Europe minister Ben Macpherson said: \u201cEdinburgh is one of the world\u2019s best-known cities for bringing in the New Year. Few places celebrate quite like Scotland - the home of the world-renowned Hogmanay celebrations. \u201cScotland\u2019s ties with our European and international friends and neighbours stretch back many centuries, and this year\u2019s celebrations reflect those ties of friendship, business, culture and commerce - strong ties that the Scottish Government and so many others are determined to see endure, whatever the New Year holds in terms of the Brexit process.\u201d Elsewhere in Scotland, Inverness is hosting Scotland\u2019s biggest free Hogmanay celebration while celebrations are also taking place in centres such as Aberdeen and Stirling. More from Russia: As President Macron delivered his New Year\u2019s Eve address, demonstrators clad in high-visibility yellow vests gathered in Paris and other major cities to demand more measures in favour of the working poor and a greater say for ordinary people in the running of the country, in the form of citizen-sponsored referendums. French police faced down protestors wearing yellow vests as they seemingly planned to celebrate the new year on the Aquitaine bridge in Bordeaux, south western France. Almost 150,000 security force members have been deployed around France to keep the peace. It is expected that hundreds of cars will be set alight this evening in what has become a grim annual ritual that ties up police officers. I will post a full report of Macron\u2019s speech from our correspondent Angelique Chrisafis shortly. Photos from Astana, \u201cone of the strangest capital cities on Earth\u201d, Kazakhstan. The fireworks in Russia, live! Putin struck a defiant tone in his national address and called on Russian\u2019s to work together and become more prosperous just moments before the firework display. The Observer columnist of Peep Show stardom, David Mitchell, has bade farewell to 2019 with some less than sincere \u2013 yet oddly plausible \u2013 predictions. Several photos have just come through from Allepo, which the Syrian government recaptured last year. In case you missed it: Hong Kong welcomed the new year with a pyrotechnics show over Victoria Harbour, while Taiwan\u2019s capital held a firework display around the Taipei 101 skyscraper. In South Korea, a traditional bell-tolling ceremony was held near City Hall in Seoul, and North Koreans watched fireworks and a music performance in Pyongyang. Sydney Harbour in Australia held its biggest ever show. In New Zealand, colourful fireworks burst from the top of the Auckland Sky Tower \u201cHogmanay\u201d festivities are in full swing in the Scottish capital with a traditional ceilidh folk music dance for kilt-wearing revellers under Edinburgh Castle. A whisky-fuelled street party was due to be attended by tens of thousands of people in the main Princes street thoroughfare before a concert by the Glasgow indie outfit Franz Ferdinand and a firework display. \u201cHogmanay\u201d is the Scots word for \u201clast day of the year\u201d and its origins stretch all the way back to the Vikings\u2019 winter solstice celebrations. Partying in Edinburgh began on Sunday with a torch-lit procession through the city and is set to end on New Year\u2019s Day with a \u201cloony dook\u201d - or \u201ccrazy dip\u201d - in the River Forth beneath its three famous bridges. A collection of celebratory photos from south Asia. Its 2019 in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Oman, Azerbaijan and Mauritius. Dubai\u2019s fireworks display, interspersed with state propaganda, is well worth watching back in full. The fireworks replace last year\u2019s somewhat anticlimactic LED lightshow that ran down the facade of the 828-metre tower. Beneath a photo of Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of the Emirate of Dubai, read a statement proclaiming: \u201cFuture generations will look at our achievements and follow in our footsteps.\u201d The words \u2018respect\u2019, \u2018wisdom\u2019, and \u2018sustainability\u2019 were then beamed down the world\u2019s tallest tower, the Burj Khalifa, before the \u2018Year of Zayed\u2019 was announced. Cafes and restaurants with a view of the Burj Khalifa charge a premium for their locale on New Year\u2019s Eve. Casual sandwich chain Pret a Manger, for example, charges $817 for a table of four. That price gets you hot and cold drinks and some canapes. For burgers near the action, fast food chain Five Guys charged $408 per person for unlimited burgers, hotdogs, fries, milkshakes and soda. Elsewhere in the United Arab Emirates, the emirate of Ras al-Khaimah attempted to set a new Guinness World Record with the longest straight-line display of fireworks reaching 7.35 miles. You have to pay close attention to the world\u2019s time zone\u2019s when live-blogging New Year\u2019s eve celebrations, and it brings into sharp focus the fact some cities are heralding the beginning of 2019 at different hours even though they sit on the same longitude. But why? More here on the origins of the world\u2019s time zones. They were first decided at an 1884 conference attended by around 40 states. London\u2019s sold-out New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks show will show Europe that the capital will remain \u201copen-minded\u201d and \u201coutward looking\u201d post-Brexit, Sadiq Khan has said. The London mayor said politicians in Westminster have given the world the impression that Britain is \u201cinsular, inward looking\u201d, and emphasised the theme of the night\u2019s programme that \u201cLondon is open\u201d. He said he hoped this year\u2019s event would \u201csend a message of support\u201d to the more than one million European citizens who call London their home. \u201cWell one of the things which upset many, many Londoners and many people across our country and in Europe is the tone and language used by politicians in Westminster, giving the impression we\u2019re insular, inward looking, not welcoming to Europeans,\u201d he said on New Year\u2019s eve. \u201cI think the Government\u2019s made a mess of negotiations with the European Union. Bearing in mind Parliament can\u2019t resolve the issue of how we will leave the European Union, we should allow the public to take back control with the option of staying in European Union, or accepting the deal made by the government.\u201d He vowed that London would remain the same after March 29 2019, adding: \u201cWhat tonight is about is showing the world, while they\u2019re watching us, that we\u2019re going to carry on being open-minded, outward looking, pluralistic\u201d. Tonight\u2019s about celebrating who we are as a city. We, in my opinion, are one of the greatest cities in the world, one of the reason we are one of the greatest cities in the world is because of the contribution made by Europeans. I think diversity is a strength and I think what tonight is about is celebrating that diversity. I hope that members of Parliament, members of the Government will see the fireworks tonight, will listen to the soundtrack and will reflect on what sort of country they want to live in post-March. The Thames-side display will bring together more than 100,000 spectators to watch the largest annual firework display in Europe, including eight tonnes of fireworks. Big Ben will return to action to start the countdown after remaining silent for the year during renovation works. The Metropolitan Police advised ticket-holders to pack lightly and only bring essentials, as no backpacks or suitcases will be allowed into the event. The event will be broadcast on BBC One. New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations are underway in Hajduszoboszlo, 200km east of Budapest, in Hungary ahead of midnight. Tradition-keepers are cracking whips in line with 16th century traditions. According to folklore, local people chased away the Turkish army from the settlement with the sounds of cowbells and whips. New Year\u2019s Eve in the US is all about \u201cthe drop\u201d, reports Joanna Walters in New York. Lacking a Big Ben, Sydney Harbour Bridge fireworks or even the pips on Radio Four, Americans basically ignore local global icons such as the Empire State Building and have always turned to New York\u2019s Times Square to mark the new year. Millions watch - crammed on the streets in person, freezing and without toilets, or on TV - a giant crystal, illuminated ball descending down a pole at midnight, high above the heart of New York City. But many places across the US refuse to rely on the New York ball drop and have devised their own versions to mark midnight - but always involving a \u2018drop\u2019, according to this CNN report. Idaho, the state most famous for producing spuds, has the New Year\u2019s Eve potato drop. In the state capital, Boise, a giant, glowing fibre glass potato will be lowered on the stroke of 2019. Tallapoosa, in the state of Georgia, celebrates with a \u2018possum drop\u2019 - a stuffed possum is lowered inside a ball at midnight. Alabamians in the city of Mobile enjoy a moonpie drop. A 600-pound (270 kilo) imitation version of this beloved southern US snack - crafted from chocolate, marshmallow and sweet crackers - is lowered on New Year\u2019s Eve after a giant version of the real thing is cut up and eaten by the crowds. California wine country enjoys a grape drop, with a giant bunch of said fruit, while it\u2019s party central in Florida, where different locations celebrate the passing of the old year with, variously, a flip-flop drop, a conch shell drop, a pirate\u2019s wench drop (don\u2019t ask, but it\u2019s a live human), and an oversized lime wedge dropping into a giant margarita glass. Tuna, a huge, illuminated version of a wall-eye fish, a large donut and a watermelon are \u2018dropped\u2019 in other parts of the country. For anyone looking to toast the arrival of 2019, this is how to open a bottle of champagne according to racing driver Lando Norris. A breathtaking displayer earlier in Kuala Lumpur. Indians are celebrating the New Year on the streets of New Delhi. Earlier today photographers captured the spectacular final sunset of 2018 in the south Asian state. A quick round up on at how people are ushering in 2019, courtesy of the Associated Press: As Russians raised toasts to celebrate across the country\u2019s 11 time zones, President Vladimir Putin stressed the need to rely on internal resources to improve living standards. In a televised address just before midnight, Putin said that \u201cwe can achieve positive results only through our own efforts and well-coordinated teamwork.\u201d Raising life quality remains the top priority, he said, adding that it\u2019s necessary to tap domestic resources to achieve the goal as \u201cthere wasn\u2019t and there won\u2019t be anyone to help.\u201d The statement sounded like an oblique reference to continuing Russia-West tensions and Western sanctions. The nation\u2019s festive mood was marred by the collapse of an apartment building Monday in Magnitogorsk that killed at least four. Putin visited the city to oversee rescue efforts. While many Thai\u2019s celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve with fireworks, hundreds travelled to Takien Temple in a suburb of Bangkok to lie inside coffins for traditional funeral rituals. Participants believe the ceremony symbolizing death and rebirth helps rid them of bad luck and allows them to be born again for a fresh start in the new year. They held flowers and incense in their hands as monks covered them with pink sheets and chanted prayers for the dead. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t scary or anything. It is our belief that it will help us get rid of bad luck and bring good fortune to our life,\u201d said Busaba Yookong, who came to the temple with her family. Dozens of people have been injured in the Philippines ahead of New Year\u2019s Eve, after powerful firecrackers were set off despite a government scare campaign and threats of arrests. The Department of Health said it has recorded more than 50 firecracker injuries in the past 10 days, which is expected to increase overnight when Filipinos usher in 2019. Officials have urged centralized fireworks displays to discourage wild and sometimes fatal merrymaking. The notorious tradition, worsened by celebratory gunfire that turned deadly, stems from a Chinese-influenced belief that noise drives away evil and misfortune. Earlier on Monday, suspected Muslim militants remotely detonated a bomb near the entrance of a mall in Cotabato as people did last-minute shopping ahead of celebrations, killing at least two and wounding nearly 30, officials said. Japanese usually welcome the New Year with a visit to a temple or shrine, but some 30,000 people at Saitama Super Arena did it with Floyd Mayweather. The American boxer soundly defeated his opponent, Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa, in the first round of what was billed as three rounds of entertainment with no official record, meaning both fighters still retain their undefeated tallies. \u201cI told Tenshin to hold your head up high,\u201d Mayweather said of his advice after the bout. Nasukawa was floored three times in the first round, and although he kept getting up, teetering, his father in the corner threw in the towel. New Year\u2019s Eve isn\u2019t celebrated widely in mainland China, where the lunar New Year in February is a more important holiday, but countdown events were held in major cities, and some of the faithful headed to Buddhist temples for bell-ringing and prayers. Beijing was holding a gala with VIP guests at the main site of the 2008 Summer Olympics. The event looked ahead to the 2022 Winter Games, which also will be held in the Chinese capital. Happy New Year to people in Nepal, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Bhutan. I\u2019ll post photos as and when they come in. India and Sri Lanka are next up in a few minutes. What a time to be alive. It is now 2019 in Bangladesh following yesterday\u2019s election which saw the prime minister Sheikh Hasina secure her third consecutive term in a landslide victory that the opposition alliance condemned as \u201cfarcical\u201d. It claimed the vote was marred by violence and intimidation, amid accusations of vote rigging. The New Year\u2019s celebrations in Dhaka tonight are likely to be somewhat muted. An English-language newspaper announced earlier today a series of restrictions on freedom of assembly and movement. According to The Daily Star, those included: No meeting, gathering or celebration on rooftops, roads, flyovers or public place No open air cultural programme or function allowed Fireworks not allowed at any place People can enter Gulshan area through Kakoli crossing and Amtoli crossing, but after 6:00pm they have to show their ID cards Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) has discouraged people who live in other areas from entering Gulshan, Banani, Baridhara and Dhaka University area After 6:00pm no one would be allowed to remain in Hatirjheel area Residents of Gulshan, Banani and Baridhara are requested to return in their respective homes before 8:00pm on December 31 DMP will take measures to control narcotics Bars would remain closed after 6:00pm City dwellers are requested not to carry any licensed arms in public places on December 31 from 6:00pm to 6:00am of January 1 A police drone will be keeping watch over New Year\u2019s celebrations in New York\u2019s Times Square for the first ever time. The Associated Press have more here in this lengthy, but very interesting report: The unmanned eye-in-the-sky is the latest wrinkle in the New York City Police Department\u2019s ever-evolving plan to keep revelers and \u201cRockin\u2019 Eve\u201d host Ryan Seacrest safe. About 7,000 police officers will be on duty for Monday night\u2019s festivities in Times Square, including counterterrorism teams with long guns and bomb-sniffing dogs. Police cars and sand-filled sanitation trucks will be positioned to stop vehicles from driving into the crowd. And, above it all, a remote-controlled quadcopter will be giving police a unique view of the merriment and any potential mayhem. It\u2019s the first time the NYPD is sending up a drone for a big event. \u201cThat\u2019s going to give us a visual aid and the flexibility of being able to move a camera to a certain spot with great rapidity through a tremendous crowd,\u201d Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism John Miller said. Police are also harnessing new technology to detect drones that aren\u2019t authorized to fly. The NYPD\u2019s drone adds to a vast array of visual surveillance that includes more than 1,200 fixed cameras and feeds from police helicopters circling above. The department started using drones this month. It says they\u2019ll mainly be used for search-and-rescue missions, documenting crime scenes and monitoring large events. Several of the NYPD\u2019s drones are equipped with thermal-imaging and 3D-mapping capabilities and strong camera lenses that can greatly magnify a subject. For safety, Chief of Department Terence Monahan said the New Year\u2019s Eve drone will be tethered to a building and flown in a cordoned-off area so that no one gets hurt if it happens to fall. The drone will never fly directly above the crowd, he said. Unlike a helicopter, a drone is small and makes little noise. Between the sounds of performers like Christina Aguilera and Bastille and the confetti that\u2019ll be swirling at midnight, Monahan said some spectators might not even notice it. \u201cOnce it\u2019s up in the air, it will probably be hard to see,\u201d he said. Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill said there are no known, credible threats to the city or the New Year\u2019s Eve event. He encouraged spectators to remain vigilant and to alert officers if they suspect something is awry. \u201cThere\u2019s probably going to be a cop within 10 feet of you,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIf you see something, you can go right to them directly.\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday that the city is expecting \u201cup to 2 million people in Times Square itself\u201d for the ball drop, repeating a figure often cited by city officials, organizers and television broadcasters. Crowd-size experts say it\u2019s impossible to cram that many people into the area, a bow-tie-shaped zone running five blocks between Broadway and 7th Avenue, and that the real total is likely fewer than 100,000. No matter how many people actually show up, they\u2019ll all be screened with metal detectors at security checkpoints and funneled into penned off areas to prevent overcrowding. Umbrellas, backpacks and coolers are banned, but those kitschy \u201c2019\u201d glasses are most definitely allowed in. And there won\u2019t be any popping champagne at midnight. The NYPD says alcohol is strictly prohibited. That might be for the best. There aren\u2019t any bathrooms, and anyone leaving the secure area won\u2019t be allowed back to their original spot. That means they\u2019ll risk missing the ball drop or having to squint hard to see it from a faraway vantage point. Like last year, the NYPD is embedding detectives in hotels around Times Square in an attempt to thwart a potential attack like the one in Las Vegas last year in which a gunman shooting from a hotel room killed 59 people at an outdoor country music festival. Here we have photos from Singapore, where 2019 was welcomed around an hour and a half ago. The sky over Bangkok, Thailand, has been lit up by a spectacular fireworks display as the south-east Asian country ushers in the 2019. In Jakarta, Indonesia, crowds gathered at the Hotel Kempinski for the countdown. Elsewhere in the capital, the city\u2019s government organised a free mass wedding for more than 500 poor Indonesian couples who may not possess official documents such as birth of marriage certificates, hamstringing their efforts to tie the knot \u2013 until now! I\u2019ll be taking over the blog now from colleagues, feel free to get in touch on Twitter if there is anything we might have missed from across the world this evening. Have a happy 2019! As the UK gear\u2019s up for the biggest party of the year, the London Ambulance Service has tweeted a plea to revellers to drink responsibly so they do not have to rely on their services. The New Year has been welcomed in in Hong Kong. China\u2019s President Xi Jinping has delivered a New year message in which he declared that the pace of reform in China will not stagnate and that the country\u2019s door will be opened wider to the outside world. Xi has repeatedly pledged his support for reform this year, as China marks 40 years since landmark changes to its economic model, amid mounting pressure to improve market access for foreign companies as a trade war with the United States weighs. In a speech carried by all major state media, Xi said that in 2018 China had pushed more than 100 important reform measures. \u201cThe world has seen a China whose reforms and opening up have gathered speed...,\u201d Xi said. \u201cOur pace of reforms will not stagnate, and the door to opening up will widen further.\u201d Xi made no specific mention of the trade war with the United States, noting that 2019 would bring \u201copportunities and challenges\u201d. It\u2019s going to be a big year for the world\u2019s second largest economy - this Guardian piece has the lowdown on some of the challenges - not least, as ever, on the Human Rights front. In particular, security is expected to be tight on June 4 as the Chinese and the rest of the world remember the killing of several hundred civilians during a military crackdown on democratic protest in 1989 in Tiananmen Square. The Pope has been adding his voice to the end of year messages: As it happens, the pope\u2019s tweet comes at the end of a year of upheaval in the Holy See\u2019s communications structure, which continued today with the resignations of the Vatican spokesman and his deputy over disagreements on strategy. A brief Vatican statement gave no reason for the resignations. Spokesman Greg Burke, an American, tweeted that he and his Spanish deputy, Paloma Garcia Ovejero, had quit to let Pope Francis appoint a new team in what was a \u201ctime of transition\u201d. A Vatican source quoted by Reuters said both Burke and Ovejero had wanted more autonomy from the Vatican department that oversees all communications, known as the Dicastery for Communications. In the Philippines, dozens of people have been injured by firecrackers ahead of New Year\u2019s Eve, when many across the country set off powerful firecrackers in one of Asia\u2019s most violent celebrations despite a government scare campaign and threats of arrests. The Department of Health said it has recorded more than 50 firecracker-caused injuries in the last 10 days, which is expected to increase overnight when Filipinos usher in 2019 with a bang. Although still a concern, the figure is significantly lower than a year ago, partly because fewer Filipinos have purchased firecrackers due to hard economic times. Officials have urged centralized fireworks displays to discourage wild and sometimes fatal merry-making. The notorious tradition, worsened by celebratory gunfire that turned deadly, stems from a Chinese-influenced belief that noise drives away evil and misfortune. The World Health Organisation has been suggesting some alternative methods of celebration: New Year celebrations are working their way across other countries, including North Korea. Reuters have been streaming events in the DPRK here: Tokyo has also been celebrating Some New Year\u2019s Even messages have already been released by political figures, including this one from Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn: and Scotland\u2019s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable Theresa May has yet to put one out on twitter. Downing Street have released this 2018 Diary Highlights video, although it is fairly sparing on mentions of Brexit other than including footage of the prime minister making a statement in the House of Commons at the end. Suzanne Moore has written a piece for the Guardian in which she says that she\u2019ll be raising a glass in 2019 to the \u201cmany great and good women out there who shine light into the darkness,\u201d to #MeToo, and \u201cto a world in which we keep fighting for basic freedoms\u201d. She adds: Because we can win. We can beat the fundamentalists. Think of that glorious day in May in Ireland when women finally won the right to control their own bodies. Think about how that felt \u2026 and hold on to that feeling. We are just beginning. On the topic of Ireland and its voters\u2019 legalisation of abortion, the first day of 2019 sees the referendum result become a legal reality. Terminations will be legal up to 12 weeks\u2019 gestation for the first time in the history of the state. Ireland\u2019s health minister today described the introduction of abortion services in the country from January 1 as \u201cmomentous\u201d. Simon Harris also said he is confident there are enough GPs to provide the service. \u201c(It) is really a momentous day,\u201d he said \u201cAbortion is a very sensitive issue. We\u2019re talking about women in crisis pregnancies... we\u2019re talking about people in very, very difficult situations. Up until now... their options have been to travel or to go on the internet. All that changes (as of January 1).\u201d It follows a referendum in May which paved the way for the liberalisation of the country\u2019s strict abortion laws. Some 66.4% of the electorate voted to repeal an amendment in the Irish constitution, which effectively banned the termination of pregnancies, and replace it with legislation to introduce abortions up to 12 weeks without restriction. More than 147,000 security forces will be deployed to New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations across France as gilets jaunes anti-government protesters were expected on the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris and Emmanuel Macron prepared a televised address on his plans for 2019 amid plummeting approval ratings and continuing unrest. Tens of thousands of police officers, military personnel, civil security guards and firefighters will be stationed in major cities in part due to the ongoing terrorist threat after a gunman killed five people at Strasbourg\u2019s Christmas market earlier this month. But security has also been reinforced in Paris and cities including Bordeaux and Nice in case of surprise anti-government protests by the gilets jaunes \u2013 or \u201cyellow vests\u201d \u2013 movement. Anti-government demonstrators are continuing to barricade roundabouts and motorway tollbooths and still come to major cities each Saturday to protest for better pay and conditions and against what they see as Macron\u2019s arrogance and disconnection from real-life and his tax policies in favour of the rich. Regular protests in Paris and other cities have led to violent skirmishes with police, car-burnings and attacks on shops and banks (Read on). Organisers of the Times Square ball drop, New York City\u2019s traditional New Year\u2019s ceremony, have invited a group of journalists to press the ceremonial button. Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance, said in a statement it was \u201cfitting to celebrate free press and free speech as we reflect on where we\u2019ve been during the past year and what it is we value most as a society\u201d. Among the group will be Karen Attiah, who as global opinions editor of the Washington Post oversaw the work of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi writer resident in the US who was murdered and dismembered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. The death of Khashoggi has been perhaps the highest-profile incident in a year for of worrying developments for press freedom around the world. Attiah has become a prominent voice in attempts to hold to account Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, accused of responsibility for the murder, and his allies in the Trump White House. The group of journalists onstage as midnight approaches will be accompanied by Joel Simon, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a group which has had a busy year under an onslaught of criticism from President Donald Trump. Among institutions regularly derided by the president as \u201cfake news\u201d, the New York Times will be represented by deputy managing editor Rebecca Blumenstein, CNN will send anchor Alisyn Camerota, and NBC will provide Lester Holt, the anchor who famously interviewed Trump about his firing of FBI director James Comey, an event at the heart of the Mueller investigation into Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow. In September, CNN was among targets of explosive devices allegedly sent in the mail by a fervent Trump supporter. The Times Square celebrations will feature the usual celebrities and singers, with Snoop Dogg, Sting and Christina Aguilera booked to do their spangly thing. Forecasters have predicted a more comfortable evening than last year, which was one of the coldest on record. This time, rain will be possible as the gathered throng sees Bebe Rexha sing Imagine, by John Lennon, before the traditional new year countdown. Jeff Straus, president of Countdown Entertainment, which produces the Times Square show, said: \u201cAs the ball drops, the special guests will lead the 60-second countdown to 2019 joined by millions of revelers with a message of unity and harmony for the new year. \u201cWe thank the news organisations and the journalists for helping us celebrate journalism and press freedom around the world.\u201d The British author Philip Hoare has written a piece in which he considers how the environmental damage being inflicted on the planet has briefly slowed down over the past week and a half, and how new possibilities are still possible. It\u2019s fairly brief and worth a read. Here\u2019s a snatch: But now, for a few days, that insatiable human speed has slowed down. Like a sudden fall of snow, it\u2019s as if the turning has forced an amnesty between us and the rest of creation. In the interregnum that this end of the year creates, the natural world briefly resumes its sway. We have time to peer up at the moon, see shooting stars, smell air that isn\u2019t filled with diesel fumes; some of us even dare to swim in the sea, relishing the barbaric cold for the way that it reminds us we are physical beings, alive and mortal, and the way that the tides determine another kind of timetable. It awaits a new start. Lying on our backs, we might look up at the night sky where stories began, as John Berger said. Got to say though, Sydney did look fairly spectacular. Emergency services in the UK are gearing up for their busiest night of the year. The Metropolitan Police advised ticket-holders for tonight\u2019s fireworks show to pack lightly and only bring essentials, as no backpacks or suitcases will be allowed into the event. The event will be broadcast on BBC One for those who were unable to buy a ticket. In London, the silence that has mostly enveloped Big Ben since renovation work began on it in August 2017 will be broken tonight as the temporary bells ring out from inside the scaffolding As with Edinburgh, Brexit appears to be very much in the background to the shape of this year\u2019s celebrations in the city. London\u2019s sold-out New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks show will be a celebration of the capital\u2019s relationship with Europe, Sadiq Khan has said. As part of the mayor\u2019s London Is Open campaign, his office said the event will send a message of support to the more than one million European citizens living in the capital. Khan has previously expressed his backing for a People\u2019s Vote and has voiced his concerns over the effects of a no-deal Brexit on the capital. The display will bring together more than 100,000 spectators to watch the largest annual firework display in Europe, including eight tonnes of fireworks. Of course, the new year has also hit other Australian cities including Melbourne... not that there seems to be any sort of rivalry or anything about how they ring it in... It\u2019s 2019 in Sydney, where Reuters are broadcasting the fireworks display live New Year\u2019s Eve isn\u2019t celebrated that widely in mainland China, where the lunar New Year in February is a more important holiday, but countdown events were being held in major cities and some of the faithful headed to Buddhist temples for bell-ringing and prayers. The city of Beijing was holding a gala with VIP guests at the main site of the 2008 Summer Olympics. The event looked ahead to the 2022 Winter Games, which also will be held in the Chinese capital. Additional police were deployed in parts of Shanghai, where a New Year\u2019s Eve stampede in 2014 killed 36 people. In Beijing, outdoor revelers had to brave temperatures well below freezing. President Xi Jingping, in a message broadcast at the top of the evening news, outlined the country\u2019s achievements over the past year and said that by hosting a series of multinational meetings in 2018, \u201cwe have put forward China\u2019s proposals and sent out China\u2019s voice.\u201d In Hong Kong, festive lights on the city\u2019s iconic skyscrapers provided the backdrop for a fireworks, music and light show over Victoria Harbor on a chilly evening. About 300,000 people were expected to line the waterfront. The new year is also nearing in Korea, where, after an eventful year that saw three inter-Korean summits and the easing of tensions over North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, South Koreans enter 2019 with hopes that the hard-won detente will expand into a stable peace. Thousands of South Koreans were expected to fill the streets of the capital, Seoul, for a traditional bell-tolling ceremony near City Hall to usher in the new year. Dignitaries picked to ring the old Bosingak bell at midnight include famous surgeon Lee Guk-jong, who successfully operated on a North Korean soldier who escaped to South Korea in 2017 in a hail of bullets fired by his comrades. Elsewhere, about 10,000 people were expected to attend the tolling of a \u201cpeace bell\u201d at Imjingak, a pavilion near the border with North Korea. In the north, Leader Kim Jong Un is expected to give his annual address on New Year\u2019s Day laying out the country\u2019s priorities for the year ahead. The speech is often the best gauge of what the North Korean leadership is focused on and what tone it will take in its dealings with the outside world. Kim\u2019s speech it will be parsed carefully for clues about his thinking on denuclearization talks with Washington and a second summit with President Donald Trump, relations with South Korea, and North Korea\u2019s efforts to get out from under international sanctions as it tries to build its domestic economy. The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, has issued a bleak New Year\u2019s message that called climate change an existential threat and warned that \u201cit\u2019s time to seize our last best chance.\u201d He noted growing intolerance, geo-political divisions and inequality, resulting in people \u201cquestioning a world in which a handful of people hold the same wealth as half of humanity.\u201d \u201cBut there are also reasons for hope,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we begin this New Year, let\u2019s resolve to confront threats, defend human dignity and build a better future together.\u201d Linking the fate of nations like Kiribati with New Year\u2019s resolutions for a moment, the Extinction Rebellion climate protest group is urging people to \u2018Rebel for Life on Earth\u2019 as their resolution. From 1st to 7th January 2019, it is inviting anyone interested to take part in Extinction Rebellion\u2019s \u2018Rebel for Life on Earth\u2019 campaign. Douglas Rogers, one of Extinction Rebellion organisers, said: Complementing Extinction Rebellion\u2019s nonviolent peaceful protests which aim to highlight the stark reality of government and media inaction in the face of human-caused ecological collapse, this January we are asking people to take time to reflect on their personal and collective relationship with different aspects of the foundations of life on earth. We\u2019re still waiting (and might be in perpetuity) on the first images to come in showing New Year on the Pacific island nation of Kiribati, the first in the world to welcome the new year. Made up of low-lying atolls which straggle along the equator, celebrations are likely to have been on the muted side however after its people spent 2018 on the frontline of the battle against climate change. Much of the nation\u2019s land mass, occupied by 110,000 people, is endangered by rising seas which have inundated coastal villages. The rising oceans have turned fresh water sources brackish, imperilling communities and raising doubts the nation will exist at the next New Year. Former President Anote Tong said the only future for Kiribati may be mass migration. The new year was welcomed in the capital, Tarawa, with church services and mostly quiet private celebrations, reports the Associated press. If you\u2019re curious about Kiribati, or indeed, care about the very real existential challenges it faces in the decades ahead you could do worse than read this piece from the Guardian\u2019s Kate Lyons about Tong\u2019s work to advocate for more robust action on climate change. The New Year\u2019s resolutions have started to filter through... Next up is Australia, where the cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra will be celebrating in around an hour and half from now. On the other side of the world, meanwhile, preparations are at an advanced stage for what is still one of the best known and oldest events: Edinburgh\u2019s Hogmanay As the clock ticks down towards Brexit, organisers say this year\u2019s event in the Scottish capital celebrates the ties between Scotland and Europe as the UK prepares to leave the EU in 2019. Bands, DJs, street performers, dancers, acrobats and fire eaters from Scotland and mainland Europe will be performing at the street party, which starts at 7.30pm. There will be music across three stages, with Gerry Cinnamon headlining the Waverley stage, Judge Jules headlining the DJ stage in Castle Street and Elephant Sessions on stage in South St David Street. Franz Ferdinand will headline the Concert in the Gardens at the foot of Castle Rock, supported by Metronomy and Free Love, while some of the country\u2019s top ceilidh bands will play at Ceilidh under the Castle. The three-day festival opened on Sunday with the traditional torchlight procession, culminating in Holyrood Park where the outline of Scotland was lit up. Something else to look out for now in 2019? A return trip to the UK by Donald Trump. The possibility was floated in an interview this morning with the BBC by the US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson. Asked whether the state visit promised last year by Theresa May could be rescheduled to coincide with a commemoration of the end of the second world war in May, Johnson told Nick Robinson on the Today Programme: \u201cBetween you and me, I think that would be a good time.\u201d Which also (possibly?) means the return of... It\u2019s a few minutes to midnight now in New Zealand (where Auckland Council has promised to turn a deaf ear to New Year\u2019s Eve noise complaints). The New Zealand Herald reports that the council has said it will not be attending any party noise complaints between 6pm on December 31, 2018 and 2am on January 1, 2019. Meanwhile, folks have been getting in the mood. So they\u2019ve just said hello to 2019 in the Pacific. Next up is New Zealand in less than an hour\u2019s time, before they crack open the champagne in Australia (or just pull the duvet a bit tighter over the head.. depending on your style) It\u2019s been a fairly soggy run-up in Sydney however, where thousands of people waiting to watch the New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks around the harbour were battered by torrential rain as a thunderstorm swept in. There\u2019s also been some disquiet about those famous fireworks. Sydney\u2019s lord mayor, Clover Moore, has called ticketed New Year\u2019s Eve events around the city\u2019s harbour an \u201coutrageous\u201d money-making exercise by the state government. Tomorrow meanwhile sees the inauguration of Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right, pro-gun, pro-torture populist elected in 2018. He\u2019ll begin a four year term in office, to the joy of some, to the horror of others. Either way, he\u2019s going to somewhat unavoidable in 2019, so here he is in his own words: Now the world has dipped its toe into 2019, here\u2019s a look ahead to the new year\u2019s elections, anniversaries, awards, contests \u2013 and ( unavoidably?) Brexit Some of the key first news events of the year include the first meeting - in a few days - of the USA\u2019s 116th Congress after Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives last year. February in particular looks like it might... er... be interesting. NT7, a two-to-four kilometre-wide asteroid discovered by astronomers in 2002, is expected to pass close to Earth. Nasa representatives have said there is no chance of a collision. That\u2019s on the day of the month. So Happy New Year, Samoa (and Kiritimati), where the memories of this time last year aren\u2019t exactly the best. The year started with a few that consumed a large part of the Fa\u2019asootauloa Pati building at Vaitele. Here\u2019s a look back at the nation\u2019s year from the Samoa Observer: Fans enjoy the music at the Wondergarden Festival during the celebrations at Silo Park in Auckland, New Zealand. As we await the first fireworks of 2019, here a selection of some of the defining image of 2018, from California wildfires and an erupting volcano to a close-up crocodile snap For many though, it might be hard to look past this one of US border agents detaining a Honduran mother and child. So, feeling optimistic? We\u2019re on the cusp of a new year and the first celebrations are set to break out in the Pacific on Christmas Island and Samoa, where clocks hit midnight in less than 15 minutes. Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the new year festivities as they roll inexorably around the globe. We\u2019ll be bringing you the highlights, images and resolutions over the course of today and tonight. It\u2019s been a year where - if you\u2019re in the UK and the US - the headlines have been dominated by Donald Trump and Brexit. Around the world the headlines have included a horrific conflict in Yemen, the ongoing conflict in Syria, \u2018Yellow Vest\u2019 protests in France, the election of a new, far right, president in Brazil, the Khashoggi affair, a US-China trade war, the migrant caravan making its way across Mexico towards the US border and rising global temperatures as people have felt the impact of heatwaves and wildfires. Bear with us as we may have left out a few. There have also been moments of clear, unambiguous joy of course. If you\u2019re French, it might have been your World Cup Win. Or, think of the rescue of 12 young Thai footballers and their coach after they were trapped in flooded caves, for example. And now we\u2019re about step into 2019. Ever get the feeling that you need to tighten your seatbelt a bit?",

The three main architects \u2013 Greenblatt, Friedman and Jared Kushner \u2013 all come from a business background and their position has been to treat the conflict like a<strong> </strong>deal.

A European diplomat in Jerusalem told the Guardian on condition of anonymity that it was \u201cdistinctly possible that we could get to the end of Trump\u2019s presidency with no [peace] proposals\u201d. With few predicting success, Palestinians are presented with two options: accepting a plan drafted by the least receptive US administration to their cause since peace efforts began, or continuing to face punitive measures. If the plan is rejected out of hand, the status quo \u2013 in which Israel entrenches its occupation of the West Bank and continues to enforce a blockade on Gaza \u2013 will remain. However, US officials insist that there are genuine peace efforts. The three main architects \u2013 Greenblatt, Friedman and Jared Kushner \u2013 all come from a business background and their position has been to treat the conflict like a deal. With economic incentives they hope to convince a side that has historically prioritised issues of principle, such as the right of refugees to return to their homes or to call Jerusalem their capital. \u201cThere is no reason the Palestinians (in both the West Bank and Gaza) can\u2019t enjoy economic success and integrate into a thriving regional economy \u2013 if they let us help,\u201d the trio wrote in a Washington Post op-ed in July. Trump also sees any negotiations as transactional, saying he has to force the Palestinians to reach an agreement by weakening their hand through aid cuts. The president referred to his Jerusalem declaration as a bargaining \u201cchip\u201d taken away from the Palestinians. In a message sent a year ago to other senior officials on cutting funding to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, Kushner wrote in internal emails obtained by Foreign Policy: \u201cOur goal can\u2019t be to keep things stable and as they are \u2026 Sometimes you have to strategically risk breaking things in order to get there.\u201d Shortly after Greenblatt was appointed last year, Tania Hary, the executive director at Gisha, an Israeli non-profit that promotes the freedom of movement of Palestinians, said her office started receiving calls from his team asking questions on the economy in Gaza, which has been kept under an Israel blockade for a decade. Greenblatt does not cite the blockade as a reason for the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, but focuses blame on its rulers, Hamas, and the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, which has blocked funding to the enclave. \u201cMy impression at the time was that I was being approached by business-minded people who thought they could solve a problem from a business perspective,\u201d Hary said. \u201cThey recognised that there were obstacles to growth that included restrictions on movement and access,\u201d she said, adding that her advice was that Gaza\u2019s problems cannot be solved by keeping it isolated from the West Bank and Israel. But then they stopped calling. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if that [message] carried through.\u201d",

Concern about teething problems has deterred many GPs from signing up to abortion services.</p> <p>An online consultation by the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) found that 43% were unwilling because of concerns about the rollout, especially \u201creferral pathways\u201d to secondary care involving ultrasound and hospital services.</p> <p>Tony Cox, the ICGP\u2019s medical director, said: \u201cA small but significant group, particularly younger GPs, see the introduction of abortion services as a significant milestone for women\u2019s health services in Ireland.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe the majority of members are concerned that the introduction has been rushed, that the referral pathways won\u2019t be in place for a while, but are optimistic that it will settle down and that the media interest will subside, and the 24-hour helpline will work smoothly.\u201d </p>",

The Irish president, Michael Higgins, signed the regulation of termination of pregnancy bill into law on 20 December, paving the way for services to open in January. Campaigners have hailed it as an overdue breakthrough for women\u2019s rights and equality. Under the new system, GPs will provide abortions to women up to nine weeks pregnant and hospitals will perform terminations at between nine and 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, abortions will be allowed only in exceptional circumstances. The service will be largely free, with the state paying GPs approximately \u20ac400 per patient. As the rollout nears, all sides are apprehensive. Pro-choice groups criticised a mandatory three-day \u201ccooling off\u201d period for women who request abortions, calling it a sop to anti-abortion activists that lacked any medical basis. They also worry about uncertainty over those seeking abortions after 12 weeks, estimated in about 17% of cases. \u201cWe expect there will be a significant cohort of women who won\u2019t be catered for,\u201d said Murphy. She expected hundreds of such cases to end up in British clinics this year. Anti-abortion advocates have been dismayed, saying the referendum was not a mandate for abortion on demand. Brendan Leahy, the bishop of Limerick, said Ireland was experiencing an \u201cinglorious watermark\u201d. Doctors, nurses, counsellors and administrators worry about bottlenecks and confusion in a health service already creaking from dysfunction and long waiting lists. A 24-hour, seven-day helpline will direct women to local GPs who provide abortions. Concern about teething problems has deterred many GPs from signing up to abortion services. An online consultation by the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) found that 43% were unwilling because of concerns about the rollout, especially \u201creferral pathways\u201d to secondary care involving ultrasound and hospital services. Tony Cox, the ICGP\u2019s medical director, said: \u201cA small but significant group, particularly younger GPs, see the introduction of abortion services as a significant milestone for women\u2019s health services in Ireland. \u201cWe believe the majority of members are concerned that the introduction has been rushed, that the referral pathways won\u2019t be in place for a while, but are optimistic that it will settle down and that the media interest will subside, and the 24-hour helpline will work smoothly.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Senator Elizabeth Warren jumped into the race for president on Monday, announcing she is forming an exploratory committee for 2020. \u201cI\u2019m in this fight all the way,\u201d she said on Monday afternoon. The Massachusetts Democrat, known for her critiques of big banks and corporations, became the first major candidate to declare her intentions with a video posted online on New Year\u2019s Eve. \u201cAmerica\u2019s middle class is under attack,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice.\u201d Warren, 69, is entering what is likely to be a crowded Democratic primary field seeking to take on Donald Trump. Those considering bids include a slew of fellow senators such as Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, the former vice-president, and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. In her four and a half minute announcement video, Warren stressed the economic populist message that has brought her to national prominence. She mixed old family photos with charts showing the declining middle-class share of income and the gap between black and white household wealth, and discussed her upbringing in Oklahoma and her family\u2019s struggle to make ends meet after her father had a heart attack that left him unable to work. \u201cWorking families today face a lot tougher path than my family did,\u201d she said. \u201cOur government\u2019s supposed to work for all of us, but instead it has become a tool for the wealthy and well-connected.\u201d Warren did not mention Trump by name in the video, but it showed images of him along with allies Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon and Fox News personalities Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity. The video says: \u201cThe whole scam is propped up by an echo chamber of fear and hate designed to distract and divide us \u2013 people who will do or say anything to hang on to power.\u201d Warren, a former law professor, gained prominence for her critique of Wall Street after the 2008 financial crash, and proposed what became the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She ran for the Senate in 2012, defeating incumbent Republican Scott Brown. As a senator, she has proposed legislation to overhaul the way corporations operate, requiring them to obtain government charters to operate and consider their public\u2019s interests rather than just those of their shareholders. She gained fans for standing up to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell on the Senate floor, turning his admonishment of her \u2013 \u201cNevertheless, she persisted\u201d \u2013 into a slogan. But Warren has suffered significant missteps as well, and become a favorite target for conservative critics who paint her as the the epitome of the east coast, academic liberal elite they often disparage. She drew criticism for the release of a DNA test intended to prove her Native American heritage, which offended some Native American groups and led to doubts about her political acumen. The Cherokee nation secretary of state, Chuck Hoskin Jr, called her move \u201cinappropriate and wrong\u201d and said: \u201cSenator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage.\u201d She is also a favorite target of Trump, whose taunts calling her \u201cPocahontas\u201d prompted the DNA test. He has also labeled her \u201cGoofy Elizabeth Warren\u201d. Commenting on Warren\u2019s 2020 announcement in an interview with Fox News, set to air late on New Year\u2019s Eve, Trump said he would \u201clove to run against her\u201d. \u201cSo, we\u2019ll see how she does. I wish her well, I hope she does well.\u201d Even in her heavily Democratic home state, Warren is a polarizing figure. The editorial board of the Boston Globe, noting that she won re-election with fewer votes than Republican Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker, encouraged her not to run for president. \u201cThose are warning signs from the voters who know her best,\u201d the paper wrote. \u201cWhile Warren is an effective and impactful senator with an important voice nationally, she has become a divisive figure. A unifying voice is what the country needs now after the polarizing politics of Donald Trump.\u201d At a press conference Monday afternoon near her Cambridge home where she was joined by her husband and dog, Warren brushed off concerns she could be too polarizing to be elected. \u201cWhen we show \u2013 not just tell, but show \u2013 what Democrats can get out there and make happen, I think that\u2019s how we win,\u201d she said. \u201cThe problem we\u2019ve got right now in Washington is that works great for those who\u2019ve got money to buy influence, and I\u2019m fighting against that, and you bet that\u2019s going to make a lot of people unhappy.\u201d Forming an exploratory committee will allow Warren to begin raising money for the presidential campaign. In past campaigns, she has had success raising small-dollar donations. Trump has said he would welcome a run against Warren. \u201cI hope she\u2019s running for president, because I think she\u2019d be very easy,\u201d he said in October. \u201cI hope that she is running.

In October the NSW parliament passed laws to allow survivors to seek justice and sue unincorporated organisations, including churches, following recommendations by the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. The laws came into effect on 1 January and are retrospective, allowing past victims to seek justice. \u201cI\u2019m pleased my first item of business in 2019 is to condemn the \u2018Ellis defence\u2019 to the scrapheap and create a fairer civil litigation system for all child abuse survivors,\u201d the NSW attorney general, Mark Speakman, said. \u201cThis means all survivors of institutional child abuse in NSW will now have the same access to compensation through civil litigation, no matter what kind of organisation is responsible.\u201d Previously, churches were protected from being sued by a legal precedent which said a church, the assets of which are held in a trust, could not be sued because it did not legally exist. The precedent was set when the Catholic church won a legal battle against John Ellis, a former altar boy who was sexually abused at the age of 13 by the former Bass Hill parish priest Father Aidan Duggan. Ellis sued Duggan, the trustees of the Roman Catholic church for the archdiocese of Sydney, and Cardinal George Pell, but the NSW court of appeal found Pell and the trustees were not proper defendants in the proceedings. It ruled the trustees didn\u2019t control Duggan and weren\u2019t responsible for his conduct, and couldn\u2019t be sued. Duggan died in 2004, soon after proceedings commenced, and Ellis was left with no one to sue over the abuse he suffered. Under the new laws an institution must now identify a defendant with sufficient assets to pay any potential claim, or have the court appoint associated trustees who can access trust property. \u201cWe are now going to see a pathway to justice for survivors of abuse that they haven\u2019t had in the past,\u201d said Ellis. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long, long battle.\u201d He told the ABC he had felt a sense of responsibility because his case put it \u201cin black and white\u201d that the church could not be sued, but in the years since, and particularly during the royal commission, he felt very supported.

Priorities are likely to include climate change, the Global Partnership for Education, towards which Macron pledged \u20ac500m (\u00a3452m) of funding, and migration.</p> <p>The G7\u2019s larger cousin, the G20, will meet in Japan in June.

It is possible once the impact of slowing growth in China and rising interest rates are put together, since most of the momentum after the financial crash of 2008 was based on cheap borrowing and the rapid expansion of Chinese trade.

      "bodyText": "A year is much more than just 365 days, or one orbit of the Earth around the sun. One year produces so many events and human stories that in 2018 alone, the Guardian published more than 73,000 news articles. Much of what happens is unpredictable. But with 2019 only hours old, there are a few things that can confidently be foretold. Politics and elections Brexit may be clear as mud, but if it\u2019s making you queasy then here are a few fixed political points in the year to steady the balance. It\u2019s a busy year for elections, with four of the world\u2019s most populous democracies holding votes. Europe holds parliamentary elections from 23-26 May to elect 705 new MEPs. Watch closely to see how well the populist far-right does. It\u2019s been gaining ground across the continent, but will the attentions of Steve Bannon, formerly of Breitbart and the Trump White house, help or hinder? Before that, Nigerians head to the polls in February. Sitting president Muhammadu Buhari faces a record 78 opposition candidates, some of whom accuse him of failing to deal adequately with corruption. Following an illness earlier this year and five months spent recuperating in London, there have also been bizarre suggestions that he has been replaced by a body double. That would certainly make campaigning in the world\u2019s seventh most populous country easier. Other major democracies going to the polls include India, where Narendra Modi is seeking a second term, and Indonesia, where the one-term incumbent faces a challenge from yet another rightwing populist candidate. Speaking of rightwing populists, Brazil\u2019s newly elected and controversial president Jair Bolsonaro takes office on 1 January. Other notable votes take place in Thailand (February), South Africa (May), Argentina (October) and Canada (October). And finally, in Japan, Emperor Akihito will abdicate in April owing to health concerns after heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer. This will be the first time a Japanese emperor has abdicated in two centuries. What summits are there to climb? The last time France hosted the G7 summit of the world\u2019s most industrialised nations in 2011, migration was a fringe issue, Emmanuel Macron was a little-known investment banker and the riots were happening across the channel in the UK. This time around, President Macron will welcome his peers to Biarritz in August. Priorities are likely to include climate change, the Global Partnership for Education, towards which Macron pledged \u20ac500m (\u00a3452m) of funding, and migration. The G7\u2019s larger cousin, the G20, will meet in Japan in June. Founded after the financial crash of 2008, the summit promotes cooperation and a focus on global financial markets. The G20 has been criticised for becoming \u201ca stage for an increasing number of authoritarian and populist leaders who are there to perform for their restive followers back home\u201d. According to the Guardian\u2019s economics editor Phillip Inman, this year\u2019s version will be \u201cincreasingly hampered by Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist policies\u201d. Another year means another COP \u2013 the abbreviation for the annual UN climate summits that warn, with increasing severity, how imperilled we are by our carbon addiction. Alas, this year\u2019s host, Brazil, has pulled out owing to \u201cbudget restrictions\u201d. If the summit goes ahead, discussion will surely centre on Trump\u2019s continued disavowal of the Paris agreement, and a review of the 2030 UN Sustainable Development goals, four years on from their implementation. The Women Deliver conference, which is held once every two years on women\u2019s equality and gender rights, will take place in June in Canada, with Justin Trudeau billed to speak \u2013 the first time a sitting leader of a country has done so. What anniversaries and milestones are coming up? As 2018 marked the 100th anniversary of the first world war armistice, so 2019 will see the 100th anniversary of the Treaty of Versailles, the formal end of the conflict. It is also the 70th anniversary of the founding of Nato, the collective defence pact originally set up to \u201ckeep the Russians out, the Americans in and the Germans down\u201d. The internet is poised to pass a notable milestone meanwhile, with predictions that the number of global users will pass the 50% mark in 2019. In the US, for the first time ever the population will have more people older than age 60 than younger than age 18. In births and deaths, 2019 is the 500th anniversary of the death of original renaissance man Leonardo Da Vinci and the 200th anniversary of the birth of Queen Victoria. It also marks the 250th anniversary of Captain Cook reaching New Zealand, and the 20th anniversary of the creation of the euro. What\u2019s happening in science? This year will mark the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin\u2019s moon landing. No human has been back since 1972. Perhaps a moment to rekindle interest in our cosmological outrider. The year will also see the first private spacecraft from SpaceX and Boeing take crews to the International Space Station. There will also be the first images of a black hole from the Event Horizon telescope, and the first results from the ESA\u2019s Trace Gas Orbiter probe, which is circling Mars to work out if methane plumes are due to life on the planet. Back on Earth, the landmark agreement to redefine the kilogram will come into place in May. Rather than being tied to a lump of metal stored in a Parisian vault, the new definition will be a reflection of Planck\u2019s constant, a number rooted in the quantum world. The weight is over. 2019 could see the first birth in the UK of a baby with DNA from three parents. The process of mitochondrial transfer was legalised in Britain in 2015 and Professor Alison Murdoch has since been pioneering the technique in Newcastle, with the first woman selected to take part in the process this year. John Vary, a futurologist at John Lewis\u2019s Innovation Labs, notes some broader, science fiction-style developments which may also intrigue us in 2019. \u201cIn 2019, we could reach a point where customers can share their DNA with shops so that retailers can tailor products to a customer\u2019s genetics or ancestry,\u201d he predicts. \u201cWaitrose &amp; Partners is piloting DnaNudge, an app which will use shoppers\u2019 DNA to help them make healthier choices while food shopping. Another example is OME Health, which offers health plans built on a person\u2019s gut microbiome, genetics blood markers and other health data.\u201d Will there be a global recession?

Without these two essential elements, the major economies are heading for trouble. Most doomsayer analysts consider 2020 a more likely year for a slump, with the seeds sown in 2019 by poor policy making.\u201d The World Bank is predicting a global slowdown in 2019, as the stimulative impact of Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts wane in the US and China is forced to restrict borrowing by state and private businesses. Central banks are also poised to tighten monetary policies. \u201cThe US Federal Reserve is due to increase interest rates at least twice in 2019,\u201d Inman says. \u201cIt is also expected to further unwind its quantitative easing policy. An increase in the cost of borrowing is already hitting the US housing market which is reaching levels of distress last seen in the run up to the 2008 financial crash.\u201d The World Trade Organisation could be unableto judge trade disputes between countries in 2019. When he took office, Donald Trump blocked the appointment of judges to the WTO to replace retirees, leaving a large number of vacancies. The WTO needs a minimum number of legal experts to judge cases and could be inquorate as early as spring 2019. What should I buy in 2019? There will be no shortage of new technological releases in 2019. Samsung is due to launch follow-ups to its critically acclaimed Galaxy S and Note series, while Apple will be announcing a new iPhone in September, and Google the Pixel 4 phone in October. Amazon will be announcing new products in September, likely to be iterations of its home management Echo devices, and Apple will unveil new Macs and tablets in October. In terms of tech developments, the Guardian\u2019s assistant technology editor Samuel Gibbs predicts that the biggest advance will come in the form of flexible screens in 2019. Futurologist John Vary adds that the voice search enabled by products such as Google Home and Amazon\u2019s Alexa will develop to \u201cenable people to find items however they describe them and in any language\u201d. While augmented reality could enhance personalised shopping to mean \u201csmart home tech could act as your own shopper, alerting retailers in advance when you\u2019re looking for a product,\u201d he says. What can I (binge) watch? With Channel 4 moving to new headquarters in Leeds in 2019, the Guardian\u2019s TV editor, Lanre Bakare, picks the fourth season of comedy Catastrophe and Brexit: The Uncivil War, as ones to watch on the channel next year. Catastrophe tells the story of a couple raising a child conceived in a one night stand. The two-hour Brexit drama meanwhile stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Leave campaigner Dominic Cummings, and is based on first-hand accounts of the campaigns leading up to Britain\u2019s referendum on leaving the EU in 2016. Further recommendations include big-budget sequels \u2013 the final season of fantasy thriller Game of Thrones, airing on Sky Atlantic in April. There\u2019s also the third season of the brooding American noir True Detective in January. Moonlight Oscar winner Mahershala Ali takes the lead from season two\u2019s Colin Farrell and Rachel McAdams. Finally, everyone\u2019s favourite local Norwich radio presenter returns to the BBC with a satirical take on a live talk show in February on This Time \u2026 With Alan Partridge. On the big screen there is a volley of new releases to look out for. With 2018 being a record-breaking year for box office takings, major studios will be hoping to replicate their success with a slate of blockbusters: a live-action Lion King in July, Captain Marvel in May \u2013 the franchise\u2019s first female-led film \u2013 Toy Story 4 in June, Terminator 6 and Frozen 2 in November, and the final instalment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy, Star Wars IX, in December. The Guardian\u2019s film editor Catherine Shoard\u2019s picks include King\u2019s Speech director Tom Hooper\u2019s adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Cats, starring Idris Elba, Taylor Swift, Judi Dench and Ian McKellen. There is also the Downton Abbey movie; Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman, starring Godfathers Al Pacino and Robert De Niro; Get Out director Jordan Peele\u2019s latest horror, Us; an adaptation of Donna Tartt\u2019s novel The Goldfinch starring Nicole Kidman; and Greta Gerwig\u2019s adaptation of Little Women, starring 2018\u2019s newcomer Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. Valued at more than $93bn, the games industry almost doubles the revenue of the international film industry, and the Guardian\u2019s games editor Keza MacDonald has some selections for 2019. Keza picks out Harry Potter Go, made by the creators of Pok\u00e9mon Go, as \u201canother potential world-conquering mobile game\u201d, she says, this time based on the Harry Potter universe. There is also Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice \u2013 a horror samurai game from the director of Dark Souls, \u201cone of the best games of the decade\u201d, according to MacDonald; and The Last of Us Part 2, an \u201cintense, cinematic game about a survivor of a world-decimating outbreak \u2013 far from the usual boring zombie story\u201d. Further reading Adele by Leila Slimani (February) One of the runaway bestsellers of 2016 was Slimani\u2019s Lullaby, a chilling tale of a homicidal immigrant nanny, and Slimani hopes to continue this success with a new novel telling the story of a sex-addicted Parisian journalist. Black Leopard, Red Wolf by Marlon James (February) Marlon James releases the follow-up to his Man Booker Prize-winning 2015 novel, A Brief History of Seven Killings. With Black Leopard, James creates an imaginary ancient world built on African mythology to tell the story of a hunter tracking a lost child. It is the first in a new trilogy, Dark Star. The Liar by Ayelet Gundar-Goshen (March) Israeli author Gundar-Goshen pens her third novel on a teenage girl who accuses an older minor celebrity of sexual assault. A fictionalised tale building on the #MeToo movement of 2017-18. The Other Americans by Laila Lalami (March) Pulitzer prize finalist Lalami writes a novel charting the American immigrant experience through the eyes of a Moroccan family living in California. It is already earning praise from the likes of JM Coetzee. Clear Bright Future by Paul Mason (April) Journalist Paul Mason follows up on 2016\u2019s Postcapitalism, which formulated a collapse of capitalism as we know it, with a theorisation of what makes us human and how we are still capable of changing the future. The Heartland by Nathan Filer (April) Former mental health nurse Nathan Filer publishes his second book, a collection of first-person encounters and essays on the diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia.",

Yet Farrell remains England\u2019s most important player and their leader talisman with the World Cup nine months away. His degree in management and leadership, which included a 12,000-word essay on reflective learning, proves Farrell is more than just a fierce competitor.

Did he learn much about himself? \u201cDefinitely. Not anything too new and drastic, just deeper understanding about everything you do.\u201d</p> <p>Farrell has always been a leader with the loudest voice on the training field and during games. Even when he made his Saracens debut, 11 days after turning 17 in 2008, Farrell expressed himself. Has he become even more vocal since becoming England\u2019s captain? \u201cNo. I hope I\u2019ve got better but I don\u2019t think the captaincy changes me much.

That\u2019s a good thing for me.\u201d</p> <p>Farrell was not very calm when, shortly after this interview, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tmo-the-monday-overview-owen-farrells-ref-chat-backfires-7868jz870\" title=\"\">he fell out with the referee Tom Foley</a> during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/22/exeter-saracens-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">Saracens\u2019 defeat by Exeter Chiefs</a> on 22 December.

That feeling of being uptight or angry can\u2019t last.\u201d</p> <p>Most leaders, especially coaches and captains, find it difficult to switch off after a big game. Does Farrell also struggle? \u201cI\u2019m a lot better at it now than I was. It helps that I love thinking about the game. At the same time, when stuff doesn\u2019t go quite right and I get uptight I can carry it home.\u201d</p> <p>2018 was a difficult year for England. Having won successive Six Nations championships under Jones, including the grand slam in 2016, they finished second bottom last season \u2013 losing three consecutive matches. Farrell then captained England on their summer tour of South Africa where they lost the opening two Tests, having built clear leads in both games. They missed key players but England looked adrift. Since an improved autumn, when they won three out of four games, has Farrell been able to identify what went so wrong in that five-match slump?</p> <p>\u201cSometimes it can be about confidence. You lose a couple of tight ones and things get hard. Sometimes you can be too desperate to win games and therefore you play on the edge and do things you wouldn\u2019t normally do. Like the penalty count. Nobody wants to give penalties away but when your confidence is low, and you\u2019re a bit too desperate, you can\u2019t help but do that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBut when you get a couple of wins the confidence returns, probably without you knowing it.

You don\u2019t go into a game thinking I\u2019m not confident. You always think you\u2019re going to win. But in big games, like the autumn, it comes down to fine margins.\u201d</p> <p>It is easy to imagine that a driven Farrell would take defeat badly. \u201cThe initial reaction is yes. But the main thing for me is that a loss offers a lot. It probably shouldn\u2019t be this way but a loss probably opens more doors for you than a win. To really buy into something, and to take it to another level, you sometimes need a loss. We had that last year at Saracens when we lost seven on the bounce. We <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/01/dan-leavy-inspires-leinster-to-beat-holders-saracens-in-champions-cup\" title=\"\">suffered a big loss in Europe against Leinster</a> in a quarter-final but we opened up, came back strong and it allowed us to play like we did for the rest of the season.

That regenerated optimism also seems to be surging through England as another Six Nations and the World Cup loom. \u201cDefinitely. We\u2019re excited. People are always going to drag it towards the World Cup and, of course, that\u2019s what everyone is aiming at. But we\u2019re looking at what we can do now to improve.

Acknowledging that the festive period can be stressful for some families \u2013 \u201csometimes we get on each other\u2019s nerves\u201d \u2013 the archbishop drew parallels with wider society.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re wonderfully much more diverse than we used to be. Yet we disagree on many things. And we are struggling with how to disagree well. Turn on the television, read the news, and you see a lot that could tempt you to despair,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cHope lies in our capacity to approach this new year in a spirit of openness towards each other.

      "bodyText": "The archbishop of Canterbury has urged the country to start 2019 in a \u201cnew spirit of openness towards each other\u201d in an attempt to overcome the struggles and divisions of recent years. Justin Welby was delivering a new year message from Lambeth Palace, his London base. Acknowledging that the festive period can be stressful for some families \u2013 \u201csometimes we get on each other\u2019s nerves\u201d \u2013 the archbishop drew parallels with wider society. \u201cWe\u2019re wonderfully much more diverse than we used to be. Yet we disagree on many things. And we are struggling with how to disagree well. Turn on the television, read the news, and you see a lot that could tempt you to despair,\u201d he said. \u201cHope lies in our capacity to approach this new year in a spirit of openness towards each other. Committed to discovering more of what it means to be citizens together, even amid great challenges and changes. \u201cThat will involve choosing to see ourselves as neighbours, as fellow citizens, as communities each with something to contribute. It will mean gathering around our common values, a common vision and a commitment to one another. \u201cWith the struggles and divisions of recent years, that will not be easy. But that difficult work is part of the joy and blessing of being a community.\u201d In recent weeks, Welby has spoken of the need to \u201ccalm down the hatreds\u201d over Brexit, and for reconciliation and restraint, while acknowledging it could take 10 years for the fractures to heal after \u201cso much bitterness\u201d. The archbishop is known to have voted remain in the 2015 referendum on the UK\u2019s membership of the European Union but has said the outcome must be respected and people with different views must reconcile. Reconciliation \u201cinvolves regret and repentance, it involves acknowledging where things went wrong, where you went wrong, where the other went wrong, it involves truth seeking, it is a process that is cautiously piled layer upon layer upon layer until you\u2019ve built this bridge across the gap,\u201d he told ITV in the run-up to Christmas. In his new year address, Welby spoke of the community of young people from around the world who spend almost a year at Lambeth Palace in prayer and contemplation, alongside charity work. The St Anselm\u2019s community, which Welby set up three years ago, comprises 15-20 people from different Christian traditions who have given up conventional work and study. Last year, there were 200 applications. Welby described the project as an experiment. He said: \u201cSince 2015 we\u2019ve been bringing together young Christians from around the world to live as a community for 10 months. \u201cThey have an extraordinary range of backgrounds, cultures and opinions. They live together, cook together, volunteer with charities together, pray together and \u2013 because they\u2019re human \u2013 they clash together. \u201cThat can be over something as small as the washing-up, or as big as their politics. They are united by one thing: their faith in Jesus Christ \u2026 In this community, I find it so powerful that these remarkably different people decide to choose each other.\u201d In September, Welby said there was a renewed interest in religious communities in the UK. \u201cWe are witnessing a revival of interest in community life in its different forms: celibate and non-celibate, communal and dispersed, traditional and experimental,\u201d he wrote in the Church Times. Religious community offered an ancient and powerful answer to modern-day commitment-phobia and isolation, he said.",

      "body": "<p>The judiciary needs to be more diverse so that the public feel those on the bench are genuinely \u201cour judges\u201d rather than \u201cbeings from another planet\u201d, the president of the supreme court has said.</p> <p>In an interview to mark the centenary of the 1919 act that dismantled barriers preventing women from entering the professions, Lady Hale called for a more balanced gender representation on the UK\u2019s highest court as well as swifter progress promoting those from minority ethnic backgrounds and with \u201cless privileged lives\u201d.</p> <p>Women working in law and other professions are increasingly aware and resentful of earning less than men, said Hale, who is the court\u2019s first female president since its creation 10 years ago. She also described the compulsory retirement age of 70 for judges as a \u201cwaste of talent\u201d.</p> <p>This year, 2019, marks the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the creation of the supreme court. Hale said she believed in its first decade the court had improved the accessibility and transparency of the legal system while establishing its independence more \u201cvisibly\u201d.</p> <p>Based in a neo-gothic building opposite parliament, the supreme court has pioneered live-streaming its proceedings, welcomes visitors, holds public exhibitions and prints comprehensible summaries of its complex judgments.Hale has supported the pursuit of gender equality as consistently as she can within the constitutional restraints of her position. There are currently three female justices on the UK\u2019s 12-seat supreme court \u2013 a rapid advancement on the position up until mid-2017 when she was the only woman. But how many women should there be?</p> <p>\u201cRuth Bader Ginsburg [the long-serving US supreme court justice, when asked the same question] famously said: \u2018When there are nine\u2019. There are [only] nine justices on the US supreme court bench,\u201d Hale explained. \u201cMy own view is up to a quarter [on the UK supreme court] is an important breakthrough but that there\u2019s no right number of justices of either gender. An ideal balance would be at least 60/40 either way. And so we still have a little way to go towards that.\u201d</p> <p>There are several reasons for desiring a more diverse judiciary in terms of gender balance, ethnicity and social background, Hale said. The most important of these is so the public can \u201clook at the judges and say \u2018They are our judges\u2019,\u201d rather than seeing them as \u201cbeings from another planet\u201d.</p> <p>In the high court, court of appeal and supreme court, a quarter of judges are women. Among district judges, around a third are female. Diversity, Hale said, also helps by bringing \u201cdifferent perspectives to the discussion\u201d, particularly on a \u201ccollegiate\u201d court. \u201cWe are all products of our background and our experiences, so the greater the diversity, the better.\u201d</p> <p>Having more than one woman on the supreme court had demonstrated that \u201cwomen are as different to one another as men are\u201d she said, acknowledging that it had been \u201crefreshing\u201d to sit with other women.</p> <p>While overt discrimination is illegal, there remain hurdles to overcome. \u201cWe do have in this country a gender pay gap to worry about,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more pay is [delivered] through individual negotiation rather than collective agreement, the greater the risk of imbalance.</p> <p>\u201c[Women] are just waking up to the fact that they are not being paid as much. I have heard terrible stories about even successful women barristers being offered out by their [chamber] clerks at less than their male equivalents. That\u2019s an area where there\u2019s still work to do.\u201d</p> <p>Sexual harassment has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/02/sexual-harassment-at-the-bar-not-being-reported-over-career-fears-says-barrister\">caused problems for women at the bar</a>, Hale said. She had not personally experienced problems during her career, she said, but was aware of its sexist culture \u2013 at least in the past.</p> <p>\u201cI do recall that when I was being elected to the northern circuit they required young women being elected to get on the table [as an initiation rite],\u201d she said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t require me to get on the table. [I don\u2019t know] whether they thought I could not get up or whether [it was because] I was already married to a member of the circuit.\u201d</p> <p>More progress was needed in advancing people from ethnic minority backgrounds into the higher judiciary, Hale said. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that [the pace of promotion] is slower: it is [only] more recently that members of ethnic minorities have joined the legal profession in larger numbers. Although there\u2019s definitely a way to go, [the discrepancy] may not be as bad as we thought.\u201d</p> <p>There is already a strong presence of ethnic minority judges in tribunals, county courts and among district judges, she said. \u201cThe way we can try and improve diversity in the higher echelons is being more open to transfers from other [courts]. And there have been appointments from the upper tier [tribunals] to the high court. So that is beginning to happen [though] it\u2019s still quite slow.\u201d</p> <p>She hoped the judiciary would attract \u201cmore people who have had less privileged lives\u201d. Hale added: \u201cI have had a privileged life [but] I don\u2019t come from a privileged background and that is helpful. I have experienced various disappointments and setbacks in my life. I think all of this is quite helpful.\u201d</p> <p>Lady Hale does not approve of positive discrimination, chiefly because \u201cno one wants to feel they have got the job in any way other than on their own merits\u201d. Better outreach efforts to encourage candidates are more productive, she said.</p> <p>Now 73, she is one of a small number of judges appointed before 1995 who are permitted to stay on the bench until they reach the age of 75. All those appointed since then have to retire at 70. Hale follows her predecessor, Lord Neuberger, in questioning that rule given the current shortage of high court judges.</p> <p>\u201c[He] called for the retirement age to go back to 75 and there\u2019s obviously a case for that,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a waste of talent.\u201d It would help solve the \u201cdifficulty of recruiting to the high court bench so that people could be attracted after the most expensive years of life\u201d, she said. \u201cMy husband sat until he was 75 in a \u2026 property tribunal and no one could possibly doubt he still had a huge amount to offer.\u201d</p> <p>The argument against extending the compulsory retirement age has been that it creates \u201cbed blocking\u201d, slowing the progress of younger judges up the career ladder.</p> <p>\u201cThe longer the old, white men [stay on] \u2026 the fewer posts there are for the younger more diverse judges,\u201d she said. \u201cBut given the recruitment problems, I\u2019m not sure that holds good. It does seem rather sad in these days to have a [retirement] age of 70.\u201d</p> <p>This year the supreme court, having visited Edinburgh and Belfast, is due to sit in Wales. Hale, who was born in Yorkshire, would like to hear cases outside London in the north of England and the West Country.</p> <p>One of her proudest moments, Hale said, was the article 50 case in 2016 that decided the course of Brexit amid a political and media furore. Following the high court decision, the judges were condemned as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d for ruling against the government.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of the [article 50, Gina] Miller case because it was a classic constitutional issue about what the government could do and what parliament could do,\u201d Hale explained. \u201cIt was reminiscent of the 17th-century battle between parliament and the king. We were reinforcing principles that had been established then.\u201d</p> <p>Moving the law lords out of parliament and into a separate supreme court had made \u201cjudicial independence more visible\u201d, she said. The way the media treated the article 50 case at the supreme court was very different to coverage of what happened in the high court, Hale said.</p> <p>This month the supreme court will host a display celebrating the centenary of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act, which enabled women to join the legal profession and others.</p> <p>After Brexit the supreme court is unlikely to continue referring questions about EU law to the European court of justice in Luxembourg. \u201cWe shall have to work it out for ourselves,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether it will be for the better or worse, we don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 2 January 2019 to note that 2019 marks the 10th anniversary of the supreme court and to add in more details from Hale\u2019s interview reflecting on its achievements.</p>",

The way the media treated the article 50 case at the supreme court was very different to coverage of what happened in the high court, Hale said. This month the supreme court will host a display celebrating the centenary of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act, which enabled women to join the legal profession and others. After Brexit the supreme court is unlikely to continue referring questions about EU law to the European court of justice in Luxembourg. \u201cWe shall have to work it out for ourselves,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether it will be for the better or worse, we don\u2019t know.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 2 January 2019 to note that 2019 marks the 10th anniversary of the supreme court and to add in more details from Hale\u2019s interview reflecting on its achievements.",
