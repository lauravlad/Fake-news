      "bodyText": "The European Union is poised to take control of Britain\u2019s exit by rejecting Theresa May\u2019s request for a three-month delay and setting a new withdrawal date of no later than 22 May. The prime minister is seeking an extension of the negotiating period to 30 June to allow the necessary legislation to be passed should she finally get MPs to back her deal next week. But EU ambassadors at a meeting late on Wednesday night agreed that the risks of having the UK as a member state beyond 23 May, when European elections are due, were too high. Sources said that during the discussions some member states favoured a longer period and some a shorter one, but that the room coalesced around 22 May as the absolute limit. The heads of state and government will hold a discussion on Thursday afternoon after being addressed by May, and will have to agree unanimously on the extension on the date to be written into its summit communique. \u201cThe 22nd of May has to be the limit,\u201d one senior diplomat said. \u201cThe reason is that there has got to be a very clear message from the European council. Yes to a short extension on condition that the prime minister passes her deal through the Commons. But beyond that it is utterly complicated. It cannot be done without British MEPs having been elected.\u201d The European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, told the Guardian: \u201cThere will be a problem with June. It is absolutely not in the interests of the European Union for it to beyond the date of the European elections.\u201d Unusually, draft council conclusions \u2013 the summit communique issued at the end of meetings of the leaders \u2013 were not circulated among the ambassadors. Sources said the EU\u2019s leaders would have a freewheeling debate about the extension request. The position taken by the ambassadors represents a shift in mood of the member states, who had been reluctant to accept the European commission\u2019s conclusion that an extension could not go beyond 23 May without British MEPs being elected. The EU\u2019s legal service had indicated that 1 July was the real \u201clegal backstop\u201d for an extension, as the parliament convenes on 2 July. But the chaos in Westminster has convinced the EU capitals of the dangers that the UK would end up remaining a member state beyond even then without British MEPs having been elected. Such a result could leave the EU\u2019s institutions in \u201cparalysis\u201d, the bloc\u2019s lawyers have advised. The prime minister\u2019s insistence, in her letter seeking an extension and in the Commons, that she would not hold elections while in Downing Street helped to crystallise the EU\u2019s thinking, sources said. The ambassadors on Wednesday night agreed that the Strasbourg papers, in which the EU has offered fresh assurances over the temporary nature of the Irish backstop, would be adopted by the leaders. There was a debate among the diplomats over whether the EU would write a date into their summit communique on Thursday, and it was eventually agreed that they should. There remains a chance that the extension could be even shorter than 22 May, as the British authorities would need time to organise elections. But a delay of a few weeks would be likely to solve little, senior diplomats argued. \u201cIt would be useless,\u201d said one.

Here a few of tonight\u2019s highlights at a glance:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, announced earlier tonight that the EU will only back a short extension of the 29 March Brexit deadline if Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal deal passes in parliament next week, which many believe makes a no-deal exit from the bloc more likely. <br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Jeremy Corbyn walked out of a meeting with opposition leaders the PM had invited to because Chuka Umunna, who left Labour to form The Independent Group last month, was in attendance. The Labour leader\u2019s snub has earned substantial criticism. <br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Theresa May held a short speech at Downing Street this evening, after unsuccessfully trying to have a constructive meeting with Brexiter MPs she hoped to swing. In her speech, the PM pointed the finger at MPs and blamed parliament for the delay in reaching a decision. It has not been well-received, to say the least: Several Labour MPs have since accused May of having stirred up hatred towards members of parliament with her remarks. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>A number of MPs and pundits have said they believe May has probably gambled away any chance of receiving renewed support for her deal by blaming MPs alone for the deadlock. Hell knows what\u2019s next. <br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>I\u2019m going to leave it at a remark Channel4\u2019s Jon Snow made a while ago, shortly after her speech: <br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jonsnowC4/status/1108471419044839425\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Theresa May tells the British People \u2018I\u2019m on your side\u201d ...which side is that?

I agree. I am on your side. <br>\u201cIt is now time for MPs to decide. <br>\u201cSo, today, I have written to Donald Tusk the President of the European Council to request a short extension of article 50 up to 30 June to give MPs the time to make a final choice. <br>\u201cDo they want to leave the EU with a deal which delivers on the result of the referendum, that takes control of our money borders and laws while protecting jobs and our national security? <br>\u201cDo they want to leave without a deal, or do they not want to leave at all causing potentially irreparable damage to public trust not just in this generation of politicians but to our entire democratic process? <br>\u201cIt is high time we made a decision. <br>\u201cSo far, Parliament has done everything possible to avoid making a choice. <br>\u201cMotion after motion and amendment after amendment has been tabled without Parliament ever deciding what it wants. <br>\u201cAll MPs have been willing to say is what they do not want. <br>\u201cI passionately hope MPs will find a way to back the deal I\u2019ve negotiated with the EU, a deal that delivers on the result of the referendum and is the very best deal negotiable. <br>\u201cAnd I will continue to work night and day to secure the support of my colleagues, the DUP and others for this deal. <br>\u201cBut I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than the 30th of June. <br>\u201cSome argue that I\u2019m making the wrong choice and I should ask for a longer extension to the end of the year or beyond to give more time for politicians to argue over the way forward. <br>\u201cThat would mean asking you to vote in European elections nearly three years after our country decided to leave. <br>\u201cWhat kind of message would that send? And just how bitter and divisive would that election campaign be at a time when the country desperately needs bringing back together. <br>\u201cSome have suggested holding a second referendum. <br>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s what you want and it is not what I want. <br>\u201cWe asked you the question already and you\u2019ve given us your answer. <br>\u201cNow you want us to get on with it. <br>\u201cAnd that is what I am determined to do.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-20T22:12:11.198Z\">at 10.12pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c92ac5ce4b0480f6c022cb6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-20T21:18:34.356Z\">9.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Sunday Times\u2019 Tim Shipman also seems to be among those the Prime Minister\u2019s speech has failed to capture, and fears MPs will not be overly enthusiastic either: <br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ShippersUnbound/status/1108472970605969408\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">May\u2019s statement based very heavily on No10 polling showing that even leave voters want an end to parliamentary bickering and get on with Brexit.

Brexiters used to keep a tally of how many times she had said this in the Commons, and <a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/bill-cash-and-peter-bone-on-theresa-may-brexit-betrayal-1-5907600\">at the last count it was 108.</a></p> \n  <p>Then, towards the end of February, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/feb/25/brexit-latest-news-developments-theresa-may-increasingly-likely-to-accept-article-50-extension-minister-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-5c73a81ee4b0cc09362e2eaa#block-5c73a81ee4b0cc09362e2eaa\">May started saying it was \u201cwithin our grasp\u201d to leave the EU on 29 March.</a> That was the first public hint from her that she would seek an article 50 extension.</p> \n  <p>The decisive shift came last week. After MPs voted on Tuesday for the second time to reject May\u2019s deal, and on Wednesday (in a non-binding vote) to reject no deal, May told MPs that, if they did not pass her deal soon, the alternative would have to be a long article 50 extension. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/13/brexit-mps-to-vote-on-leaving-the-eu-with-no-deal-politics-live?page=with:block-5c89626ae4b0cf92e5a56846#block-5c89626ae4b0cf92e5a56846\">She said:</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If the house finds a way in the coming days to support a deal, it would allow the government to seek a short limited technical extension to article 50 to provide time to pass the necessary legislation and ratify the agreement we have reached with the EU.</p> \n   <p>But let me be clear, such a short technical extension is only likely to be on offer if we have a deal in place.</p> \n   <p>Therefore, the house has to understand and accept that, if it is not willing to support a deal in the coming days, and as it is not willing to support leaving without a deal on 29 March, then it is suggesting that there will need to be a much longer extension to article 50. Such an extension would undoubtedly require the United Kingdom to hold European parliament elections in May 2019.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In other words, May now appears to be poised to ask for a short extension of the kind that she told MPs last week would not be on offer if the deal were not passed.</p> \n  <p>The government firmed up this position <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/14/brexit-mps-to-vote-on-delaying-departure-from-european-union-politics-live?page=with:block-5c8a995be4b016d23425c012#block-5c8a995be4b016d23425c012\">in the motion it put to the Commons for debate on Thursday.</a> That motion said that, if MPs had passed the deal by today, the government would definitely seek a one-off article 50 extension until 30 June. It did not say that, if the deal was not passed, the government would definitely seek a long article 50 extension; in other words, it did not commit the PM to requesting a long delay. But it said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[If MPs do not pass the deal by 20 March] it is highly likely that the European council at its meeting the following day would require a clear purpose for any extension, not least to determine its length, and that any extension beyond 30 June 2019 would require the United Kingdom to hold European parliament elections in May 2019.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>MPs were left with the clear impression that May would be seeking a long extension, and this is what <strong>David Lidington</strong>, the Cabinet Office minister and May\u2019s de facto deputy, said when he opened the debate for the government. <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2019-03-14/debates/74319E9E-D222-474C-8182-34997A16C472/UK%E2%80%99SWithdrawalFromTheEuropeanUnion\">He told MPs:</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If for whatever reason that [MPs passing the deal, and the EU subsequently agreeing a short extension] proves not to be possible, we would be faced with the prospect of choosing only a long extension ...</p> \n   <p>If the house has not come together around a deal by Thursday next week, the only viable extension would be a long one. We would have to hold the European parliament elections, and the government would facilitate a process with the house to consider the potential ways forward to reach a majority.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>To coincide with the debate, the government also published <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/785962/190314_-_PARAMETERS_OF_EXTENDING_ARTICLE_50_-_FINAL.pdf\">a two-page paper (pdf) </a>explaining what it said where the two options available to MPs: a short, technical extension of article 50, if May\u2019s deal gets passed in time for the EU summit; or \u201ca longer extension, if a deal is not approved before the March European council, to provide time for the government and parliament to determine what course of action the UK should pursue and take that forward, and which would require the UK to participate in the European parliament (EP) elections.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-20T10:44:16.101Z\">at 10.44am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c920d27e4b0e8eadf780c3c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-20T09:58:20.505Z\">9.58am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is from<strong> Sir Keir Starmer</strong>, the shadow Brexit secretary, on Theresa May\u2019s decision to rule out asking for a long extension to article 50.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The prime minister appears to be pursing a course of action that her own deputy last week described as reckless. </p> \n   <p>Theresa May is desperate once again to impose a binary choice between her deal and no deal despite parliament clearly ruling out both of those options last week. </p> \n   <p>What the government should be doing is showing real leadership, making good on their commitment to break the deadlock and secure an extension with a genuine purpose.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01960b5f60da8552328c183597ecdea10fb2693f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01960b5f60da8552328c183597ecdea10fb2693f/0_53_5442_3265/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keir Starmer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keir Starmer</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-20T10:45:10.153Z\">at 10.45am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c920deae4b0a5422e638148\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-20T09:55:53.833Z\">9.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And these are from RTE\u2019s Europe editor <strong>Tony Connolly</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tconnellyRTE/status/1108297859751952385\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Senior EU official: We have not received any letter to President Tusk, and have not received a request from the UK of the extension of A50 in any other form.

Rather than welcome the news that Theresa May has ruled out asking for a long article 50 extension, he said \u201cany delay\u201d would cause problems for the party. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is real, real resistance and concern in the Conservative party, not just in parliament but on a much wider spectrum around the country in the run-up to the May elections. This will without question cannon into the May elections and cause real issues and concerns on the doorstep. </p> \n   <p>Any delay creates a bow wave of problems, not just for the government here but for the governing party and, frankly, for all those people who voted to leave thinking ... we would leave on March 29.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Duncan Smith is almost certainly right about opinion in the Conservative party.

May changed her position in response to a revolt from Brexiters in her party, in cabinet and in parliament generally, who told May a lengthy article 50 delay would be unacceptable. This is what a Number 10 source said this morning confirming May\u2019s decision. The source said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>PM won\u2019t be asking for a long extension.

      "bodyText": "I am going to wrap this up now. Here a few of tonight\u2019s highlights at a glance: The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, announced earlier tonight that the EU will only back a short extension of the 29 March Brexit deadline if Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal deal passes in parliament next week, which many believe makes a no-deal exit from the bloc more likely. Jeremy Corbyn walked out of a meeting with opposition leaders the PM had invited to because Chuka Umunna, who left Labour to form The Independent Group last month, was in attendance. The Labour leader\u2019s snub has earned substantial criticism. Theresa May held a short speech at Downing Street this evening, after unsuccessfully trying to have a constructive meeting with Brexiter MPs she hoped to swing. In her speech, the PM pointed the finger at MPs and blamed parliament for the delay in reaching a decision. It has not been well-received, to say the least: Several Labour MPs have since accused May of having stirred up hatred towards members of parliament with her remarks. A number of MPs and pundits have said they believe May has probably gambled away any chance of receiving renewed support for her deal by blaming MPs alone for the deadlock. Hell knows what\u2019s next. I\u2019m going to leave it at a remark Channel4\u2019s Jon Snow made a while ago, shortly after her speech: Thanks everyone for reading and commenting, and huge thanks to all the Guardian moderators who have worked hard to make this live blog not lose countenance. Good night! The summary of Beth Rigby, deputy political editor of Sky News, is blistering: TalkRadio presenter John Nicolson: Nigel Farage embraces the apparent theme of the evening and resorts to pretty graphic threats against Theresa May and her party in tomorrow\u2019s Telegraph: That does sound like a reasonable question. The former foreign secretary William Hague has just warned on Peston that a general election is now more likely: Let\u2019s take a look at how tomorrow\u2019s frontpages have digested the evening. The Daily Express comes out with a rather gentle \u201cPM tells \u2018tired\u2019 Britain: I\u2019m on your side\u201d. The i-paper is comparatively quite a bit less polite: The Daily Mail has settled for a surprisingly neutral \u201dWe\u2019re on a no deal knife edge\u201d: The Guardian goes with \u201cMay: Don\u2019t blame me for Brexit crisis, blame MPs\u201d: The Daily Telegraph\u2019s \u201cMay \u2018on bended knee\u2019 to the EU\u201d is also pretty accusatory: The Financial Times\u2019 \u201cMay pleads with rival parties to save deal as EU issues ultimatum\u201d is a slightly different takeaway The Independent clearly has had enough of all this: In all the excitement, let\u2019s not forget that Speaker John Bercow has not actually approved a third vote on May\u2019s Brexit deal yet. As BBC Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis points out, it is not quite clear yet what kind of change to the deal Bercow would consider \u201csubstantial\u201d enough. Tomorrow\u2019s The Times frontpage appears to side with Wes Streeting et al. Extraordinary. Labour MP Wes Streeting has accused the Prime Minister of having incited hatred against MPs, and possibly even violence. Labour MPs Luke Pollard, Diana Johnson and Roberta Blackman-Woods seem to agree: \u201cBuckle up,\u201d the Times political editor, Henry Zeffman, says. Judging from the reactions of various MPs, a win for the prime minister and her deal next week seems increasingly unlikely. Paul Waugh from HuffPost and my colleague Jessica Elgot report the PM had an incredibly negative meeting with switcher Brexiter MPs just before her speech, who called for her resignation: My colleagues Rowena Mason and Heather Stewart have summed up the current state of despair in the Conservative party, which seems to only have been exacerbated by May\u2019s address tonight. The fact that Theresa May has used her speech to point the finger at MPs could massively backfire, pundits seem to suggest, one of them being the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg: And Jessica Elgot seems to agree: A petition to revoke article 50 and remain in the EU is taking off and has reached nearly 200,000 signatures, most in the last few hours. Revoke article 50 is trending on Twitter. According to the BBC\u2019s Chris Mason the DUP remains unimpressed and is set to block May\u2019s deal again: Here the the PM\u2019s full statement: \u201cNearly three years have passed since the public voted to leave the European Union. \u201cIt was the biggest democratic exercise in our country\u2019s history. \u201cI came to office on a promise to deliver on that verdict. \u201cIn March 2017 I triggered the Article 50 process for the UK to exit the EU and parliament supported it overwhelmingly. \u201cTwo years on, MPs have been unable to agree on a way to implement the UK\u2019s withdrawal. \u201cAs a result, we will now not leave on time with a deal on 29 March. \u201cThis delay is a matter of great personal regret for me. \u201cAnd of this I am absolutely sure: You, the public, have had enough. \u201cYou\u2019re tired of the infighting, you\u2019re tired of the political games and the arcane procedural rows, tired of MPs talking about nothing else but Brexit when you have real concerns about our children\u2019s schools, our National Health Service, knife crime. \u201cYou want this stage of the Brexit process to be over and done with. I agree. I am on your side. \u201cIt is now time for MPs to decide. \u201cSo, today, I have written to Donald Tusk the President of the European Council to request a short extension of article 50 up to 30 June to give MPs the time to make a final choice. \u201cDo they want to leave the EU with a deal which delivers on the result of the referendum, that takes control of our money borders and laws while protecting jobs and our national security? \u201cDo they want to leave without a deal, or do they not want to leave at all causing potentially irreparable damage to public trust not just in this generation of politicians but to our entire democratic process? \u201cIt is high time we made a decision. \u201cSo far, Parliament has done everything possible to avoid making a choice. \u201cMotion after motion and amendment after amendment has been tabled without Parliament ever deciding what it wants. \u201cAll MPs have been willing to say is what they do not want. \u201cI passionately hope MPs will find a way to back the deal I\u2019ve negotiated with the EU, a deal that delivers on the result of the referendum and is the very best deal negotiable. \u201cAnd I will continue to work night and day to secure the support of my colleagues, the DUP and others for this deal. \u201cBut I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than the 30th of June. \u201cSome argue that I\u2019m making the wrong choice and I should ask for a longer extension to the end of the year or beyond to give more time for politicians to argue over the way forward. \u201cThat would mean asking you to vote in European elections nearly three years after our country decided to leave. \u201cWhat kind of message would that send? And just how bitter and divisive would that election campaign be at a time when the country desperately needs bringing back together. \u201cSome have suggested holding a second referendum. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s what you want and it is not what I want. \u201cWe asked you the question already and you\u2019ve given us your answer. \u201cNow you want us to get on with it. \u201cAnd that is what I am determined to do.\u201d The Sunday Times\u2019 Tim Shipman also seems to be among those the Prime Minister\u2019s speech has failed to capture, and fears MPs will not be overly enthusiastic either: Chuka Umunna MP makes the case for indicative votes: Faisal Islam, political editor at Sky News, does not believe the PM chose her words very wisely, given that she has never relied more on the support of MPs: Nothing really novel in May\u2019s statement. MP\u2019s face a \u201cfinal choice\u201d, the PM emphasises. Buzzfeed\u2019s Europe editor Alberto Nardelli seems particularly underwhelmed by the PM\u2019s speech: Dominic Grieve MP tells the BBC that he will not be bullied by anybody in Government to support something he does not believe in. Adds his \u201cpreferred option\u201d remains to hold a second referendum. May statement over. She said her deal was \u201cthe best deal negotiable\u201d, and attacked MPs for failing to make a decision, urging that it was \u201chigh time\u201d they made up their minds. \u201cI am on your side\u201d, she said, addressing the British people. PM\u2019s statement has started. It is \u201cof great personal regret\u201d that Britain is not leaving on March 29, she says. So this just seems to have happened, according to a tweet of the Guardian\u2019s Brexit correspondent: At least Fraser Nelson, editor of The Spectator, still has the nerve for a bit of humour. Corbyn keeps getting flak from all sides, here from Peter Grant from the SNP: The PM is running late and is rumoured to be keeping things short and snappy. Theresa May is expected to make her statement shortly in Downing Street. It hails criticism for Corbyn\u2019s stunt, here from Jo Swinson, deputy leader of the Lib Dems: This fresh from my colleague Dan Sabbagh: The Guardian\u2019s Brexit correspondent, Lisa O\u2019Carroll, has written an update on the UK\u2019s emergency plan for a no-deal Brexit, carrying the prosaic name \u201cOperation Yellowhammer\u201d. Nick Eardley, political correspondent at the BBC, shares a few glimpses into what went down at that failed meeting between party leaders: The gloves have clearly come off. Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall just slapped the PM with another damning verdict: This just in from my colleague Jessica Elgot: Press Association reports that Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s walkout from the cross-party meeting: \u201cThat is rather a strange way to behave in a national crisis.\u201d Chuka Umunna, spokesman for the Independent Group, said: \u201cI find it extraordinary behaviour in a national crisis.\u201d Reactions of shock to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s refusal to participate in a meeting with other party leaders that the PM invited earlier are starting to populate Twitter. This from the Daily Mail\u2019s Claire Ellicott: A Labour spokesperson just said about the incident: It was not the meeting that had been agreed and the terms were broken. Downing Street is in such chaos that they were unable to manage their own proposed meeting. We are in discussions with No 10 about holding the bilateral meeting with the PM that Jeremy proposed at PMQs. This just in from the Sunday Times\u2019 political editor, Tim Shipman: Nicholas Cecil, the Evening Standard\u2019s deputy political editor, is predicting a bleak future for the PM and her third attempt to drag her deal over the line \u2013 this time with the help of Labour MPs. Downing Street has confirmed that Theresa May will make a statement at 20:15 GMT. My colleague Libby Brooks, the Guardian Scotland correspondent, is tweeting that Ian Blackford and Liz Saville-Roberts, the Westminster leaders of the SNP and Plaid, along with Lib Dem leader Vince Cable and the Green\u2019s Caroline Lucas have just released another joint statement, calling for parliament to sit in continuous session \u201cuntil it can reach a decision and set out a clear plan\u201d, with the revocation of article 50 as a last resort. Libby says it\u2019s worth remembering that it was the dogged work of a cross-party group of Scottish parliamentarians who took a court action to establish it was possible for the UK to unilaterally revoke article 50 all the way to the ECJ last December. The full statement says: We agree that the House of Commons must formulate a plan that will give the EU Council the confidence to agree a longer extension beyond 30 June, so that by the end of next week legislation can be in place to prevent a no-deal exit. Parliament should now sit in continuous session until it can reach a decision and set out a clear plan. We will be pushing for the House of Commons to support a referendum on remaining in the EU, others will put forward their own positions. If the Commons cannot agree, as a last resort we would be prepared to take steps to secure a parliamentary vote on the revocation of article 50. The prime minister must not be allowed to bully MPs into a choice between her bad deal and no deal. That would make Brexit a choice between disaster and catastrophe, and that would be a failure of truly historic proportions.\u201d Conservative MP Dominic Grieve has caused a Twitterstorm with a scathing speech he gave in the Commons earlier. Angela Smith MP seems to be a particularly big fan: My colleague Timothy Garton Ash has written a piece on why the EU might indeed grant a long extension in the end - if May\u2019s deal fails again. Hello everyone, I\u2019m taking over from my colleague Andrew Sparrow, who has provided some excellent summaries of the latest Brexit developments. Things seem to be changing by the minute, and the evening promises to not get boring any time soon \u2013 commiserations to those trapped on a wifi-free Eurostar. Jeremy Corbyn is expected to make a TV appearance in a about an hour, and Theresa May is due to make a statement \u2013 possibly in the Commons \u2013 at 8pm. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, has now released the text of the letter he has sent to EU leaders ahead of the summit starting tomorrow. Mostly it repeats what he said earlier, but there is some slightly different language on how long an extension might last. He says: In the light of the consultations that I have been conducting over the past days, I believe that we could consider a short extension conditional on a positive vote on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons. The question remains open as to the duration of such an extension. Prime Minister May\u2019s proposal, of the 30th of June, which has its merits, creates a series of questions of a legal and political nature. We will discuss it in detail tomorrow. When it comes to the approval of the Strasbourg agreement, I believe that this is possible, and in my view it does not create risks. Especially if it were to help the ratification process in the UK. Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, has a good Twitter thread on the significance of Tusk\u2019s statement. It starts here. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Jedidajah Otte is taking over now. The Labour MPs Lisa Nandy and Gareth Snell have tabled an amendment for next week\u2019s Brexit vote that would ensure that the Commons gets to vote on the negotiating mandate for the next stage of the Brexit talks covering the future trade relationship, that the PM has to make statements to the Commons about the talks every three months and that the PM cannot sign off an agreement without Commons approval. As my colleague Dan Sabbagh reports, if the government were to accept it, some Labour MPs could be persuaded to back the deal. And Sky\u2019s Kate McCann has a (sideways) version of the text. This is from Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman. France, Spain and Belgium are ready to veto a Brexit extension, the Press Association understands. The PA report goes on: Sources have said France, Spain, Belgium and maybe Italy stand prepared to reject an extension without evidence Parliament is now ready to accept a deal and \u201cthe deadlock can be broken\u201d. Some member states worry there is no point to an extension as, even after 1,000 days of negotiation, Theresa May\u2019s deal keeps being rejected and the EU cannot move any further towards the UK. One source said: \u201cWe\u2019re not against an extension per se but we need to have two things - first a demonstration that the situation has changed and there is a guarantee the extension is for something and second that an extension won\u2019t be detrimental to the EU. \u201cYes, a no-deal Brexit would be damaging and it\u2019s absolutely not what we want but I think we\u2019re ready to go to this situation because there are only two solutions - either a deal is accepted or there is no deal. \u201cThe deal has been rejected and it keeps being rejected so if we come to no-deal then so be it.\u201d It is understood French president Emmanuel Macron believes Brexit is holding up his plans for radical reform of the EU and needs to be brought to a conclusion. My colleague Jon Henley has more on what the EU feels about Britain and its handling of Brexit in this article. Downing Street said the meeting of party leaders at 6pm was in order to discuss the prime minister\u2019s letter to Donald Tusk. \u201cThe prime minister has always been very clear about her willingness to engage,\u201d her spokesman said. He went on: We have reached out to leaders of all the opposition groups, including the TIG. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the extension letter but I\u2019m sure they will raise other issues. Green party leader Caroline Lucas said she would ask the prime minister to withdraw her letter to Tusk, criticising May for only seeking consensus after the letter had been sent. She said Long after her letter to Donald Tusk found its way onto social media and without even bothering to send a copy to MPs, she has decided to invite us for a meeting about it. She sent her ERG-influenced request to extend article 50 to hold her party together, and now she is attempting to placate the rest of us by pretending to hear our concerns. In the Commons emergency debate Heidi Allen, the former Tory who now sits as an Independent Group MP, said that although Donald Tusk was saying MPs must pass the Brexit deal next week for the UK to get a short extension (see 4.38pm), \u201cclearly that is not going to happen\u201d. She added: \u201cThis government is on the edge of bringing this country down.\u201d Instead the government should allow \u201cindicative votes\u201d in the Commons immediately, with MPs given a free vote, so they can have their say and \u201cstop this madness now\u201d, she said. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, has urged the EU to cut the British government \u201csome slack\u201d in its attempt to get a Brexit deal through parliament. He said: There is a real risk of no deal happening by accident \u2026 it\u2019s time now to cut the British government some slack when it comes to their request for an extension. Speaking at a press conference in Dublin, Varadkar said he had an open mind about the length of any extension. I don\u2019t have a definitive view on how long an extension would be \u2026 [but] would prefer to see this resolved sooner rather than later. The conciliatory rhetoric however did little to ease pressure on Theresa May. Varadkar said nothing to contradict Donald Tusk\u2019s edict and insisted the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, could not be changed. The slack, in other words, is mighty short. And here is a take on Donald Tusk\u2019s statement from the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil. In the Commons the Labour MP Ian Murray says it has been confirmed that Theresa May will make a statement outside the chamber at 8pm. Can she be made to address the Commons? John Bercow, the Speaker, says it is up to May to decide whether she addresses the Commons. He says if May were to address the Commons, that would be well received. Here is some comment from journalists on Donald Tusk\u2019s statement. From Sky\u2019s Adam Boulton From the Mirror\u2019s Kevin Maguire From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the FT\u2019s Jim Pickard From Politico Europe\u2019s Charlie Cooper Back in the Commons, Anna Soubry, the former Tory who is now an Independent Group MP, says there are reports that, after meeting the opposition parties tonight for the first time as a group, Theresa May will make a statement to the media at around 8pm. Soubry says that shows May is treating the Commons with contempt. Here is the Donald Tusk statement. Today I received a letter from Prime Minister May, in which she addresses the European council with two requests: to approve the so-called Strasbourg agreement between the UK and the European commission, and to extend the Article 50 period until 30 June 2019. Just now I had a phone call with Prime Minister May about these proposals. In the light of the consultations that I have conducted over the past days, I believe that a short extension would be possible. But it would be conditional on a positive vote on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons. The question remains open as to the duration of such an extension. At this time, I do not foresee an extraordinary European council. If the leaders approve my recommendations and there is a positive vote in the House of Commons next week, we can finalise and formalise the decision on extension in the written procedure. However, if there is such a need, I will not hesitate to invite the members of the European council for a meeting to Brussels next week. Although Brexit fatigue is increasingly visible and justified, we cannot give up seeking until the very last moment a positive solution - of course, without opening up the withdrawal agreement. We have reacted with patience and goodwill to numerous turns of events and I am confident that also now we will not lack the same patience and goodwill at this most critical point in this process. Donald Tusk\u2019s ultimatum has dramatically telescoped events. MPs now face a choice between passing Theresa May\u2019s deal next week, and a no-deal Brexit. (See 4.12pm.) Tusk did not explicitly rule out a long article 50 extension. But Theresa May\u2019s comments earlier today effectively rule this out while she remains PM (see 12.08pm), and this mean the prospect of the Commons getting the time to use \u201cindicative votes\u201d to find an alternative Brexit solution may have been killed off. Hardline Tory Brexiters will welcome this ultimatum, because they believe a no-deal Brexit is better than Theresa May\u2019s deal and the prospect of Brexit now being delayed until after May now seems very slim. Having the end of next week as a very hard deadline now creates a dilemma for Labour MPs. They are strongly opposed to May\u2019s deal but, unlike some Tory Brexiters in the European Research Group, they are alarmed at what a no-deal Brexit might mean for their constituents. Given that at least 20 ERG Tories are certain to carry on voting against May\u2019s deal (and it could be many more), May will only pass her deal with Labour help. The DUP will be in a quandary too. Nothing said by May or Tusk today suggests they are going to get much new in the form of backstop concessions. Like the ERG, they are philosophically comfortable with a no-deal Brexit. But the economy in Northern Ireland would suffer disproportionately in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and the DUP may be more nervous than the ERG about taking responsibility for a scenario that could put some of their constituents out of business. Tusk says he will not give up trying to find a deal until the end. He says he will maintain goodwill until the end. And that is it. I will post the full quotes shortly. Donald Tusk says he got the letter from Theresa May today. He spoke to her just now, he says. In the light of his consultations, he says a short, extension will be possible. But it will be conditional on a positive vote on the withdrawal agreement in the Commons. Tusk says EU will only give the UK a short article 50 extension if MPs pass the Brexit deal. He says, if there is a positive vote in the Commons next week, the extension can be finalised using a written procedure. But, if needed, he will call a summit next week. Tusk will not take questions, we\u2019re told. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, is making a press statement now. Barclay says he thinks having no Brexit is more damaging to the UK than a no-deal Brexit would be. Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, says article 50 should be extended to the end of this year, at the minimum. That is the minimum amount of time needed for MPs to sort this out, he claims. In the Commons Barclay says Labour has not said what length extension it wants. He challenges the party to respond, but Starmer does not take the bait. Catherine McKinnell, a Labour backbencher, does intervene. She says business wants article 50 to be extended long enough to allow MPs to agree on an alternative approach. Barclay says Starmer wants a second referendum. But Starmer cannot say what the question would be, and he has not persuaded his party\u2019s front bench to back the policy, Barclay claims. In the Commons Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, is responding to Starmer in the emergency debate. Labour\u2019s Wes Streeting has just intervened to say that, for all her faults, at least when Theresa May speaks at the dispatch box, people think she means what she says. Streeting says the same cannot be said for Barclay, who urged MPs to back the government motion last week proposing an article 50 extension only to vote against it himself. This is from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. In Brussels some EU officials are now saying that EU leaders will not even take a decision about extending article 50 tomorrow - because Theresa May sent her letter too late. This is from my colleague Daniel Boffey. This is from the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge. And this is from RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly. Back in the Commons Starmer has just repeated what David Lidington said in the Commons on Thursday last week about it being \u201cdownright reckless\u201d to seek a short article 50 extension without a deal being passed. This is from Sky\u2019s Adam Boulton. And this is from the Mirror\u2019s Mikey Smith. The \u00c9lys\u00e9e stressed on Wednesday that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, had not yet taken a decision on May\u2019s extension request and would wait until the European council meeting on Thursday, where May is expected to explain her strategy. \u201cNo decision will be taken by France before the European council,\u201d a source in Macron\u2019s office said. Paris will then confer with other EU leaders on its response to the extension request. Starmer says that Theresa May\u2019s letter to Donald Tusk (see 12.21pm and 2.06pm) implies that she just wants to bring the same deal back for a third vote. Starmer says the main problem with Theresa May\u2019s strategy is that she seems to think the \u201cblinkered approach\u201d she has adopted up to now can just be pursued for another three months. That approach has \u201cfailed badly\u201d, he says. He says the Commons needs a different approach. The French foreign minister has said categorically that Paris could say no to May\u2019s request for an extension if the prime minister does not set out a clear plan for the withdrawal agreement to be ratified by parliament. The pro-European Emmanuel Macron, who is seeking EU reform and wants to avoid his term being bogged down in Brexit, is happy for France to take the hardest line in voicing EU exasperation. The foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told the French parliament on Wedsnesday afternoon: Our position is to send a simple and clear message to the British. He said there were only two ways to leave the EU \u2013 ratify the withdrawal agreement or a no-deal exit. He said if the withdrawal agreement wasn\u2019t ratified by parliament, \u201cthe central scenario is a no-deal exit. We\u2019re ready\u201d. Le Drian said France would examine the extension request in terms of protecting EU interests. France needed three things: First, that a short technical extension clearly sets out the path to the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. Second, that the UK \u201cis very clear that the withdrawal agreement will not be renegotiated and will be preserved in its entirety\u201d. Third, that the UK does not take part in European elections. He stated, that if May could not present \u201csufficient guarantees of the credibility of her strategy\u201d that will lead to the extension being refused and a no-deal exit. An official at the Elysee palace warned this week: Playing for time just for the sake of playing for time would not constitute a project or strategy. Now is not the time for procrastinating. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is opening the emergency debate on Brexit. He starts by saying Theresa May should be in the Commons herself to hear or respond to the debate. He says he agrees with what Ed Miliband said at PMQs about May herself being a \u201croadblock\u201d to Brexit solution. My colleague Jessica Elgot has more on Theresa May\u2019s meeting with opposition party leaders later. It will be odd if Jeremy Corbyn doesn\u2019t turn up. He was asking for a meeting with Theresa May today only a few hours ago at PMQs. (See 12.10pm.) Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, will make a statement about Brexit later, at 4pm UK time. This is from my colleague Angelique Chrisafis, with more on what the French are saying about an article 50 extension. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is making his application for an emergency debate on Brexit. John Bercow, the Speaker, says he will allow the debate. The Tory MP Peter Bone objects. But more than 40 opposition MPs stood up, which means the debate can go ahead under the standing order 24 rule. Bercow says SO24 debates normally take place on the following day, but he can allow them to take place immediately, and the debate will start soon, after the 10-minute rule bill. In the Commons Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader, has just said she has been invited to a meeting at Number 10 later. According to the Sun\u2019s Hugo Gye, all opposition leaders have been called in. In the Commons the three urgent questions are now over. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, is making a point of order now. He says the nation is in crisis, and time is short, and that he has written to the PM saying the Commons should sit on Saturday to find a way forward for Brexit. John Bercow, the Speaker, says a Saturday sitting would be possible. But it would require a resolution of the house. He says such a resolution could be put to the Commons tomorrow or on Friday. That would be possible in procedural terms, he says. But he says he is not saying he thinks the government would agree. Anna Soubry, the former Tory who is now an Independent Group MP, says the People\u2019s Vote march is happening on Saturday. If the Commons were sitting, MPs would be able to go out and meet the marchers, she says. And this Le Point report has more on Emmanuel Macron\u2019s stance on an article 50 extension. This is how the article starts. Pour Macron, c\u2019est d\u00e9cid\u00e9 : il faut ... refuser aux Britanniques tout report du Brexit, pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 la date du 29 mars. C\u2019est en tout cas la position qu\u2019il exprimera jeudi lors du Conseil europ\u00e9en. And this is how that gets translated by DeepL, with some tidying up from me. For Macron, it is decided: we must ... refuse to allow the British to postpone the Brexit, scheduled for 29 March. In any case, this is the position he will express on Thursday at the European council. The French government is taking a tough stance on the possibility of extending article 50. Reuters snapped these two lines a few minutes ago. FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER: OUR MESSAGE ON BREXIT IS CLEAR: RATIFY THE DEAL OR LEAVE WITHOUT AN AGREEMENT FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER: IF MAY CANNOT OFFER GUARANTEES HER BREXIT DEAL WILL BE PASSED IN BRITISH PARLIAMENT THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL WILL TURN DOWN HER EXTENSION REQUEST And earlier the French government spokesman, Benjamin Griveaux, said: France\u2019s position is simple: the British prime minister must explain to us for how long and what for, and offer us guarantees. A delay is therefore not automatic nor certain. The Evening Standard is splashing on Theresa May\u2019s comment that as prime minister she is not willing to delay Brexit beyond 30 June. (See 12.08pm.) They are interpreting it as a threat to resign if MPs insist on a longer delay. The only drawback with this is that it is not entirely clear at whom such a threat might be directed. Most of the MPs likely to favour a longer article 50 extension would be quite happy to see May resign, not least because that might precipitate a general election. Here are the key points from Theresa May\u2019s letter to Donald Tusk, president of the European council. (See 12.21pm.) May is requesting an extension of article 50 until 30 June. She says she intends to hold a new vote on her deal \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. This implies that she is downgrading the plan, set out by David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister on Thursday, for the government to spend two weeks after the EU summit allowing MPs \u201cindicative votes\u201d on alternative ways forward. (At the lobby briefing No 10 said this process would still go ahead, but implied that the next vote on the deal would come first.) As Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam reports, it was only because of the Lidington pledge that the government avoided defeat on a Hilary Benn amendment that would have allowed the Commons to take charge of the indicative votes process. She blames John Bercow, and his ruling about \u201cno repeat votes\u201d, for the government\u2019s failure to hold a third vote on her Brexit deal this week. (This is probably only partially true; even before Bercow anounced his decision on Monday, there were reports that the prospects of a vote were fading, because the government and the DUP had failed to clinch a deal.) She implies that she will not accept a longer article 50 extension, saying this would require the UK to take part in the European elections and that she does not think that would be in either the UK or the EU\u2019s interests, but she does not categorically say that this will not happen. MLex\u2019s Matthew Holehouse thinks this is significant. However, in PMQs May also said that \u201cas prime minister\u201d she was not prepared to delay Brexit any further than 30 June, implying this was a resigning matter for her. (See 12.08pm.) Here are some lines from the Number 10 post-PMQs briefing. From my colleague Heather Stewart From the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, is seeking to limit the Brexit delay until the 23 May, to avoid the possibility of the UK remaining a member state but without MEPs. A spokesman said Juncker had in a call told the prime minister, who has set the 30 June as her preferred end date to an extension in her letter of request, that the British would need to have representatives in the European parliament if it stayed a member state into June. The spokesman said: President Juncker said to the prime minister that he thinks it\u2019s a good idea she sets out her thoughts to the leaders ahead of the EU Council. However, the president has clearly warned the prime minister against including a date for the extension that will be after the European parliament elections. That\u2019s why he repeated in this call his advice, which he set out in his letter on March 11, that the withdrawal has to be complete before May 23, otherwise we risk facing institutional difficulties and legal uncertainty, given the European elections date. European elections have to be held if the extension date is beyond May 23. This is the position of the commission and this is what the president informed the prime minister again. Earlier on Wednesday, a leaked letter circulated among the EU\u2019s 28 commissioners reiterated Juncker\u2019s position that the extension had to be limited if elections in Britain were to be avoided. (See 12.49pm.) PMQs - snap verdict: Sometimes the PMQs experience is so wretched for a prime minister that you wonder why they don\u2019t curl up and hide under the dispatch box. Any normal human being would. But, somehow, Theresa May managed to keep going \u2013 a tribute either to her fortitude, or her stubbornness or her detachment from reality, according to your perspective. But even admirers would have to concede that her authority is shot. May\u2019s central problem is that she has abandoned a stance she was defending just last Wednesday (see 10.32am) and, even though she has U-turned under pressure from Brexiters, they were damning, horrified at the prospect of even a short article 50 extension. (Eg, see Peter Bone at 12.27pm and Richard Drax at 12.45pm.) But remainers were withering too. In fact, on Brexit, not a single MP stood up to defend her. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s broad-brush critique was perfectly sound, but his decision to start by asking for a meeting today was ill-advised (because May was entitled to respond that he has been dodging a meeting for weeks) and, considering the extent of May\u2019s humiliation, he did not really make the most of the opportunity available. Ian Blackford\u2019s questions were more focused. But the most memorable interventions came from the Labour old guard, especially Ed Miliband and Yvette Cooper, pleading desperately for the house to allowed some sort of indicative votes procedure. To no avail ... Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle says May often mentions the referendum, but she does not mention the general election, which denied her a majority, and she does not mention the two defeats her deal has suffered. She urges May to stop \u201cbanging her head against a brick wall\u201d and to allow MPs to find an alternative. Instead May is kowtowing to \u201cBrextremists\u201d, she says. May says 80% of the votes cast at the election were cast for parties that stood on a platform of honouring the referendum result. Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper says May\u2019s plan has been rejected twice. She says what May is doing is \u201cdeeply dangerous\u201d for the national interest. Calling for MPs to be allowed indicative votes, she says: \u201cI beg the prime minister to think again.\u201d UPDATE: Here is the full quote. This is from Reuters. It is the report that Catherine West was referring to a few minutes ago. (See 12.37pm.) The European commission opposes extending British membership of the European Union to June 30, as British prime minister Theresa May proposed on Wednesday, according to an EU document seen by Reuters. In a note on the Brexit process reviewed by the commission at its weekly meeting on Wednesday, officials wrote that leaders meeting May at a summit on Thursday faced a \u201cbinary\u201d choice of a short delay of Brexit from 29 March to before 23 May or a long delay to at least the end of this year, with Britain obliged to hold an election on 23 May for European parliament lawmakers. \u201cAny extension offered to the United Kingdom should either last until 23 May 2019 or should be significantly longer and require European elections,\u201d the document said. \u201cThis is the only way of protecting the functioning of the EU institutions and their ability to take decisions.\u201d EU states which were due to receive additional legislative seats after Brexit would need to know by mid- to late-April if they would be denied those seats because Britain was staying. The note also said that in any extended membership, Britain should, \u201cin a spirit of loyal cooperation\u201d, commit to \u201cconstructive abstention\u201d on key issues, such as the EU\u2019s long-term budget and filling top EU posts after the May election. Richard Drax, a Tory Brexiter, says May gave a firm commitment that the UK would leav the EU on 29 March. What guarantee can she give that, if there is an extension, the UK will leave by 30 June? May says no deal has not been taken off the table. The EU has been very clear that it will not let the UK remain in the EU if it does not hold European elections. Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, says May is the \u201croadblock\u201d to a solution. He says it is \u201cblindingly obvious\u201d that May should allow MPs to hold indicative votes, to find a way forward. May says it has been open to the house already to debate Brexit alternatives. She says it has debated other plans, and they have been rejected. Sir Oliver Letwin, a Conservative, asks May to confirm that the full length of the extension available to the UK will be available to MPs. May says, if her deal is rejected again, the house will have to decide how to proceed. (Letwin seemed to be asking for an assurance that the UK would not leave the EU before 30 June without a deal. May effectively sidestepped the question.) Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, asks if May will arrange for indicative votes next week so that MPs can find out what Brexit plan they can agree on. May says MPs have already had many opportunities to vote for Brexit alternatives. MPs have voted against a customs union and against a second referendum. She says she is clear about her intention to bring forward another motion. Labour\u2019s Catherine West says the EU is just offering an extension until 23 May, or until 2019. She asks May to back calls for a second referendum. May says she continues to think that, having asked the public for their view, MPs must do what they voted for. The Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle says May opposed repealing section 28, even though that led to LGBT people like himself being stigmatised in schools. Just today Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, took the same approach, saying parents should be able to choose when their children are \u201cexposed\u201d to LGBT education, he says. He asks May to reject Leadsom\u2019s comments. May says she will write to Russell-Moyle explaining the government\u2019s policy on LGBT education. Here is the full text of May\u2019s letter to Tusk requesting an article 50 extension. The Tory Brexiter Peter Bone says May will be betraying the British people if she extends article 50. May says she always wanted to leave on 29 March. But she wants to leave with a negotiated deal. That requires an extension until 30 June. She says at this point the house must decide what it wants. For the record, here is the full \u201creckless\u201d quote from David Lidington in the Brexit debate last week. In the absence of a deal, seeking such a short and, critically, one-off extension would be downright reckless and completely at odds with the position that this house adopted only last night, making a no-deal scenario far more, rather than less, likely. Not only that, but from everything we have heard from the EU, both in public and in private, it is a proposal it would not accept. In the Commons Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Wesminster, says that David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, said last week that seeking a short article 50 extension without MPs having passed a deal would be \u201cdownright reckless\u201d. Does May agree? May says the SNP have always wanted to stop Brexit. She says it cannot be delayed for much longer. Blackford says May\u2019s deal has been rejected twice, in the biggest and fourth biggest government defeats in parliamentary history. The only solution is to give the decision back to the people. May says parliament gave this decision to the people. Here is a more readable version of the letter to Tusk. Corbyn says today marks 1,000 days since the referendum. May is running down the clock, he says. But she has failed to convince MPs that her deal is anything other than a failure. People are frustrated by her approach. Will May give the public a chance to reject the deal and vote out the government? May says Corbyn\u2019s answer shows he does not respect the referendum result. May accuses Corbyn of disrespecting democracy by wanting to hold a second referendum. May\u2019s letter to Tusk is out. Corbyn says Labour\u2019s plan got more support in the Commons than May\u2019s. He says May said last week the EU would only allow an article 50 extension for a clear purpose. What is it? May says, if Corbyn had listened to her first answer, she would have heard. Corbyn says May proposed meaningful vote 3 (MV3). But the Commons rejected this. He says Lidington said last week it would be reckless to do what May is doing now. Is she being reckless? May says she has no idea what Labour wants. She says she is opposed to a long extension. It would mean taking part in the European elections, and it would mean hours and days of the Commons contemplating its navel on Europe. She says the Commons has indulged itself on Europe for too long. Corbyn says the CBI said the vote to extend article 50 was a dose of common sense. Will May compromise? May says the Commons has voted on and rejected leaving with no deal, Labour\u2019s deal and a customs union. It wants a deal, she says. Jeremy Corbyn starts by also condemning the New Zealand terror attack, and sending condolences to those affected by the cyclone in Africa. He says the UK is in a \u201cnational crisis\u201d. He is meeting MPs to discuss alternative approaches, and is going to Brussels tomorrow. Will May meet him today to discuss this? May says it is a bit rich for Corbyn to call for a meeting today, when he has been refusing meetings with May for days and days. And Corbyn refused to allow David Lidington to meet Keir Starmer, she says. She says Labour MPs want to avoid Brexit. May is updating MPs on Brexit. She says MPs voted for a short extension on Thursday. She says she does not think holding European elections would be in anyone\u2019s interests. That would be unacceptable, she says. She has written to President Tusk saying the UK wants an extension of article 50 until 30 June. The government will hold another meaningful vote, she says. As prime minister, I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than 30 June. May confirms that her letter requesting an article 50 extension will only propose delaying Brexit until 30 June. She says as PM she is not willing to delay Brexit beyond 30 June. Theresa May starts by condemning the \u201cappalling and cowardly attack\u201d in Christchurch on Friday. There can be no place for the appalling ideology behind this, she says. And she thanks the emergency services for how they handled the Stanwell attack at the weekend. She expresses her shock at the devastation caused by the cyclone in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. PMQs is about to start. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. I normally post a snap summary straight after the May/Corbyn exchanges, because in normal circumstances that is what attracts most interest, but today May v the Commons a whole is probably more interesting, and so I will post the snap summary at the end. And, on the subject of Labour and the length of a possible article 50 extension (see 11.46am), here is a question from a reader BTL. My response: it probably depends who you talk to in Labour. Quite how in favour of a second referendum they are is a matter of debate, with different people interpreting the party\u2019s carefully-worded comments on this subject in strikingly different ways. But there has always been an unresolved tension between Labour\u2019s notional support for an referendum (which would take at least five months to organise, according to a through Constitution Unit analysis), and its desire to avoid a long article 50 extension. You can hold a referendum, or avoid a long article 50 extension, but you can\u2019t do both. The request for an emergency debate on Brexit will come from Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, not the backbencher Alison McGovern. And this is from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. More from my colleague Dan Sabbagh on the People\u2019s Vote march. The People\u2019s Vote campaign has announced the names of some celebrities who are sponsoring coaches from their home towns to bring supporters to the march in London on Saturday. They include actor Jason Isaacs (Liverpool); broadcaster Joan Bakewell (Manchester); advertising executive and film producer Trevor Beattie (Birmingham); comedian and actor Steve Coogan (Manchester); businessman and chair of Stoke City FC Peter Coates (Stoke); Joe Hemani, chairman of tech firm Westcoast PLC and vice president of Chelsea FC (more than one coach); actor Natascha McElhone (Brighton); TV cook and majority shareholder of Norwich City Football Club Delia Smith (Norwich); and actor Sir Patrick Stewart (Huddersfield). The writer and director, Armando Iannucci, who is sponsoring a coach from Oxford to help get campaigners to the Put it to the People march on Saturday 23. Voters have been left befuddled and bemused by what\u2019s going on in Westminster and I think the only sensible thing left is to put whatever Brexit deal parliament comes up with to the voters one last time. It\u2019s just one more vote to settle matters; what\u2019s the problem? The prime minister\u2019s now on to her third. There are three urgent questions today. All three have been tabled by Conservatives, fuelling suspicions that the government is trying to fill up the Commons timetable \u2013 perhaps to delay any emergency debate on Brexit. All but three of the 20 MPs who spoke at last night\u2019s 80-strong meeting of the European Research Group, demanded that she quit, Christopher Hope reports at the Telegraph. This is from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. The Labour leadership has never explicitly backed a long article 50 extension. When Yvette Cooper put forward her first bill designed to enable parliament to take control of the Brexit process, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s main objection to it was that it proposed a nine-month article 50 extension and the party only decided to back it after being assured that that date could be changed. These are from my colleague Daniel Boffey. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope. Labour is backing calls for an emergency debate on Brexit, the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar reports. The Labour MP Alison McGovern is requesting an emergency debate on Brexit, under standing order 24 (S024), the Press Association is reporting. Under the SO24 procedure, John Bercow, the Speaker, has to decide whether he will hear a request for an emergency debate. The MP calling for one makes a very short speech in the chamber making the case for a debate and then the Speaker either accept or refuses, subject to MPs agreeing. If he does agree, the debate would take place this afternoon, or tomorrow. Normally SO24 debates attract little interest because they are usually on a neutral motion (a relatively bland, non-committal motion that cannot be amended). But interestingly, in the Commons on Monday, Bercow hinted that there could be a way of making them more muscular. In response to a question from Labour\u2019s Helen Goodman, he said: [Goodman] should look closely at the standing order no 24 procedure. What she says about it [ie, that the motion must be in neutral terms] is true, but I think that she should reflect upon the opportunities that the standing order No 24 procedure presents, because the opportunities are fuller than has traditionally been acknowledged or taken advantage of by members of the House of Commons. As Sir Keir Starmer points out (see 9.58am), what Number 10 is now saying about ruling out asking for a long article 50 extension (see 8.45am) is very hard to square with what the government was saying last week. For months or years Theresa May\u2019s line was that the UK would leave the EU on 29 March. Brexiters used to keep a tally of how many times she had said this in the Commons, and at the last count it was 108. Then, towards the end of February, May started saying it was \u201cwithin our grasp\u201d to leave the EU on 29 March. That was the first public hint from her that she would seek an article 50 extension. The decisive shift came last week. After MPs voted on Tuesday for the second time to reject May\u2019s deal, and on Wednesday (in a non-binding vote) to reject no deal, May told MPs that, if they did not pass her deal soon, the alternative would have to be a long article 50 extension. She said: If the house finds a way in the coming days to support a deal, it would allow the government to seek a short limited technical extension to article 50 to provide time to pass the necessary legislation and ratify the agreement we have reached with the EU. But let me be clear, such a short technical extension is only likely to be on offer if we have a deal in place. Therefore, the house has to understand and accept that, if it is not willing to support a deal in the coming days, and as it is not willing to support leaving without a deal on 29 March, then it is suggesting that there will need to be a much longer extension to article 50. Such an extension would undoubtedly require the United Kingdom to hold European parliament elections in May 2019. In other words, May now appears to be poised to ask for a short extension of the kind that she told MPs last week would not be on offer if the deal were not passed. The government firmed up this position in the motion it put to the Commons for debate on Thursday. That motion said that, if MPs had passed the deal by today, the government would definitely seek a one-off article 50 extension until 30 June. It did not say that, if the deal was not passed, the government would definitely seek a long article 50 extension; in other words, it did not commit the PM to requesting a long delay. But it said: [If MPs do not pass the deal by 20 March] it is highly likely that the European council at its meeting the following day would require a clear purpose for any extension, not least to determine its length, and that any extension beyond 30 June 2019 would require the United Kingdom to hold European parliament elections in May 2019. MPs were left with the clear impression that May would be seeking a long extension, and this is what David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and May\u2019s de facto deputy, said when he opened the debate for the government. He told MPs: If for whatever reason that [MPs passing the deal, and the EU subsequently agreeing a short extension] proves not to be possible, we would be faced with the prospect of choosing only a long extension ... If the house has not come together around a deal by Thursday next week, the only viable extension would be a long one. We would have to hold the European parliament elections, and the government would facilitate a process with the house to consider the potential ways forward to reach a majority. To coincide with the debate, the government also published a two-page paper (pdf) explaining what it said where the two options available to MPs: a short, technical extension of article 50, if May\u2019s deal gets passed in time for the EU summit; or \u201ca longer extension, if a deal is not approved before the March European council, to provide time for the government and parliament to determine what course of action the UK should pursue and take that forward, and which would require the UK to participate in the European parliament (EP) elections.\u201d This is from Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, on Theresa May\u2019s decision to rule out asking for a long extension to article 50. The prime minister appears to be pursing a course of action that her own deputy last week described as reckless. Theresa May is desperate once again to impose a binary choice between her deal and no deal despite parliament clearly ruling out both of those options last week. What the government should be doing is showing real leadership, making good on their commitment to break the deadlock and secure an extension with a genuine purpose. And these are from RTE\u2019s Europe editor Tony Connolly From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg Jeremy Corbyn will throw himself into the middle of the negotiations with the EU by holding talks with Michel Barnier in Brussels just hours before Theresa May seeks to persuade leaders at a summit to accept a short delay to Brexit, my colleague Daniel Boffey reports. Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative Brexiter and a former party leader, was on the Today programme this morning. Rather than welcome the news that Theresa May has ruled out asking for a long article 50 extension, he said \u201cany delay\u201d would cause problems for the party. He explained: There is real, real resistance and concern in the Conservative party, not just in parliament but on a much wider spectrum around the country in the run-up to the May elections. This will without question cannon into the May elections and cause real issues and concerns on the doorstep. Any delay creates a bow wave of problems, not just for the government here but for the governing party and, frankly, for all those people who voted to leave thinking ... we would leave on March 29. Duncan Smith is almost certainly right about opinion in the Conservative party. The ConservativeHome website regularly surveys a Conservative party members, and the results are seen as a fairly reliable guide to party opinion. When it asked members recently if they thought MPs should vote for an article 50 extension, 78% said no. And 83% of members said MPs should keep a no-deal Brexit as an option. Last week May appeared to take the no-deal option off the table by saying that, if MPs did not vote for her deal, the alternative would be a long article 50 extension, with MPs exploring alternative options (ie, a softer Brexit). These survey findings help to explain why May (who is more emotionally attached to her party than many people who have become prime minister, and who does not want to see it split) performed a U-turn overnight, putting no deal back in play. Here are some more lines from Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s interview with the German radio station DLF. Juncker, the president of the European commission, indicated that the EU would not offer any more concessions to the UK. He said: I am ready for any movement, but we have already moved intensively towards Britain. There isn\u2019t any more ... We are not in a state of war with the UK, but a state of negotiation. But the negotiations are finished. He said the EU and the UK would be \u201cin the hands of God\u201d if there were no deal by the end of March. He said: [Months set aside for a short article 50 extension] would have to produce, as an end result, an agreement from the British parliament to the [agreement] text which is before them. If that doesn\u2019t happen, and if Great Britain does not leave at the end of March, then we are, I am sorry to say, in the hands of God. And I think even God sometimes reaches a limit to his patience. Q: As a devout Christian, have you said prayers for Brexit? Leadsom says her faith is a private matter. Q: Do we need prayers? We always do, Leadsom says. And that\u2019s it. The phone-in is over. Leadsom says she has had concerns about how the EU has handled the Brexit negotiations. She says the onus is on the EU to offer more on the backstop. Q: Do you think the EU has bullied the prime minister? Leadsom says she cannot comment on that. But she says she does not think Theresa May feels she has been bullied. Q: Are we in a constitutional crisis following John Bercow\u2019s ruling? Leadsom says she does not see it that way. Q: So Robert Buckland, the solicitor general, who said the country was in a constitutional crisis was wrong? Leadsom says Buckland may have had his reasons for what he said. But she does not see it like that. She says she thinks a majority of MPs could vote to hold a third meaningful vote, regardless of the Bercow ruling. And she suggests a new meaningful vote could take place next week. Leadsom has also refused to deny a report saying she told cabinet yesterday: This used to be the cabinet that would deliver Brexit - and now from what I\u2019m hearing, it\u2019s not. She has also refused to rule out running for Conservative leader. And she hinted that she would resign if Theresa May did opt for a nine-month article 50 extension. Asked if she would stay in government in those circumstances, she refused to give that commitment. More from the Leadsom phone-in. In her LBC phone-in Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has confirmed that Theresa May will ask for a short extension of article 50. She would not say what length extension the government would be requesting, but she said the UK could not be participating in the European elections. It\u2019s absolutely essential we\u2019re out of the EU before the European elections. It would be extraordinary for the people who voted to leave the EU to find us fielding candidates for these next elections... [Theresa May is] absolutely working her socks off to get to that point, so, in seeking a short extension, she and her cabinet will be determined to get further progress on the meaningful vote so we can get her deal voted through in parliament. The elections take place from Thursday 23 May to Sunday 26 May (in the UK they would be on the Thursday, but other countries vote on Sundays), but the parliament is not due to meet until the beginning of July. At the latest, the UK would have to be out of the EU by then, although there is also an argument that it would need to be out before polling day. Good morning, and the Brexit news is breaking thick and fast. Theresa May has ruled out asking for a long extension to article 50. This is a remarkable shift from last week, when she led MPs to believe that, if they refused to pass her Brexit deal this week, she would have to ask for a long extension. May changed her position in response to a revolt from Brexiters in her party, in cabinet and in parliament generally, who told May a lengthy article 50 delay would be unacceptable. This is what a Number 10 source said this morning confirming May\u2019s decision. The source said: PM won\u2019t be asking for a long extension. There is a case for giving Parliament a bit more time to agree a way forward, but the people of this country have been waiting nearly three years now. They are fed up with Parliament\u2019s failure to take a decision and the PM shares their frustration. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, has said that a decision on extending article 50 is unlikely to be taken at this week\u2019s EU summit. Speaking to the German radio station DLF, Juncker said: We will probably have to meet again next week, because Mrs May has not got agreement for anything either in her cabinet or her parliament. As long as we don\u2019t know what Great Britain will say yes to, we can\u2019t come to a resolution. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, and one of the Tory Brexiters who argued strongly against a long article 50 extension, is on LBC now. Here is the agenda for the day. 8.30am: Andrea Leadsom, the Brexiter leader of the Commons, holds a phone-in on LBC. 9am: MPs backing the \u201cCommon Market 2.0\u201d Brexit plan hold a press conference. 10am: The People\u2019s Vote campaign holds a press conference 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. And at some point today, of course, May will be writing to Donald Tusk, president of the European council, formally requesting an article 50 extension. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up, at around 6pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news.

I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.
