      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson was on Monday night accused of presiding over a cover-up after it emerged that No 10 refused to clear the publication of a potentially incendiary report examining Russian infiltration in British politics, including the Conservative party. Downing Street indicated on Monday that it would not allow a 50-page dossier from the intelligence and security committee to be published before the election, prompting a string of complaints over its suppression. The committee\u2019s chairman, Dominic Grieve, called the decision \u201cjaw dropping\u201d, saying no reason for the refusal had been given, while Labour and Scottish National party politicians accused No 10 of refusing to recognise the scale of Russian meddling. Fresh evidence has also emerged of attempts by the Kremlin to infiltrate the Conservatives by a senior Russian diplomat suspected of espionage, who spent five years in London cultivating leading Tories including Johnson himself. It can now be revealed that Sergey Nalobin \u2013 who once described the future prime minister as \u201cour good friend\u201d \u2013 lives in a Moscow apartment block known as the \u201cFSB house\u201d because it houses so many employees from the Kremlin\u2019s main spy agency. The committee\u2019s report is based on analysis from Britain\u2019s intelligence agencies, as well as third-party experts such as the former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, and is subject to a final clearance from Downing Street. That has to come before parliament is dissolved on Tuesday if it is to be released ahead of the election. Downing Street sources stated that was not now expected to happen in time, claiming the sign-off process typically takes six weeks. A No 10 spokesman added: \u201cThere are processes reports such as this have to go through before publication, and the committee is well-informed of these.\u201d However, it is understood the dossier has already been approved by the intelligence agencies themselves as part of a long clearance process that began in late March. Downing Street was sent a final draft on 17 October and had been expected to sign off the report by the end of last week. Grieve said: \u201cThe protocols are quite clear. If the prime minister has a good reason for preventing publication he should explain to the committee what it is, and do it within 10 days of him receiving the report. If not, it should be published.\u201d The dossier specifically examines Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 EU referendum. Members of the committee \u2013 which meets in secret because of the sensitivity of its work \u2013 had wanted to make recommendations to introduce greater safeguards ahead of the December poll. Ian Lucas, a Labour MP who sits on the culture media and sport select committee, which has conducted related inquiries into the conduct of the EU referendum said \u201cthe government needs to come clean about its view on Russian interference in British politics\u201d. Ministers have argued that there are no examples of successful Russian interference in UK elections, but Lucas said that this needed to be properly tested: \u201cThis decision looks like it is designed to avoid proper scrutiny of what we actually know.\u201d Allegations that Moscow money has flowed into the Conservative party via emigres living in the UK making high-profile donations, were also heard by the committee \u2013 although the party has consistently denied receiving money improperly.

Committee members were also briefed on an extraordinary \u2013 and for a while an apparently successful \u2013 attempt to penetrate Conservative circles by Nalobin, who instigated a pro-Kremlin parliamentary group, the Conservative Friends of Russia. During his time in the UK, Nalobin went to exclusive Tory fundraising events and met senior Conservatives. In January 2014 he posed for a photograph with Johnson at an event at city hall in London. Nalobin posted it on Twitter, writing in a caption that the then mayor was \u201cour good friend\u201d who said \u201cwarm words\u201d about Russians. Conservative Friends of Russia held its 2012 launch party in the Russian ambassador\u2019s Kensington garden, with about 250 Russian and British guests present, including Tories who went on to play a prominent role in the referendum campaign. One was Matthew Elliott, now chief executive of pro-Brexit group Vote Leave, alongside Dominic Cummings, now the prime minister\u2019s chief strategist. Another guest was Johnson\u2019s future girlfriend Carrie Symonds, a Tory party activist. At the time she worked in the office of John Whittingdale, the pro-Brexit MP who was the group\u2019s honorary vice-president. The group collapsed after revelations of Nalobin\u2019s alleged ties with the Kremlin\u2019s SVR foreign intelligence agency. Over the weekend, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, raised questions over Cummings\u2019 connections to Russia, and the levels of security vetting to which he had been subject, after an official whistleblower raised concerns with her. Thornberry asked if Cummings had been asked about his relationship with members of Conservative Friends of Russia, as well as the purpose of his three-year period of work in post-communist Russia between 1994 and 1997. The Guardian\u2019s investigation was carried out with the The Insider, an independent Russian news website. Property records show that Nalobin owns an apartment at Michurinskiy Prospect 27, in south-west Moscow. The block\u2019s ties with state spying are so well established that sellers are able to advertise their properties in the \u201cFSB house\u201d at above market rates. Peers held a special debate about the withheld dossier, after an urgent question from the cross-bench peer David Anderson, a national security expert, who insisted the delay was unjustified. \u201cIt invites, I\u2019m afraid, suspicion of the government and its motives,\u201d he said. Earl Howe, responding for the government, told peers: \u201cThe length of time that the government had had for this report is not at all unusual. It was delivered on 17 October \u2013 that is not a very long time ago. And the prime minister is entitled to take his view on what the report contains.\u201d Stewart McDonald, the SNP\u2019s defence spokesman, said: \u201cParliament is about to be sent packing into a general election without fully understanding the extent to which Russia has meddled in our most recent democratic electoral events.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Huw Edwards has been confirmed as the host of the BBC\u2019s election night coverage, taking one of the most high-profile jobs in British broadcasting more than five years after he was first linked with it. He had originally been expected to succeed David Dimbleby as the face of the BBC\u2019s election programme in time for the 2015 general election, only for BBC bosses to give Dimbleby one final chance to host the show. The former Question Time host showed no interest in handing over the baton and successfully remained in the hot seat for both the 2016 EU referendum and the 2017 general election coverage. Other BBC presenters due to have leading roles in the coverage include Reeta Chakrabarti, Andrew Neil, Tina Daheley and Jeremy Vine. Vine will be responsible for the swingometer, while the website will be publishing semi-automated journalism in stories on the election results for all 650 constituencies. The BBC is preparing for criticism of its news coverage from all sides during the election, as political parties realise the effectiveness of rallying supporters by blaming the media for negative coverage. The BBC\u2019s head of news, Fran Unsworth, has already felt the need to warn audiences that during the election \u201ceveryone will hear people on BBC News they don\u2019t agree with, and opinions they don\u2019t share\u201d. She said putting a particular political candidate on air did not indicate bias: \u201cInterviewing is not \u2018platforming\u2019 and reporting someone\u2019s words isn\u2019t an endorsement of what they\u2019ve said.\u201d She said the BBC\u2019s journalists would be willing to call out falsehoods: \u201cOur aim is to achieve due impartiality. That means understanding that not all issues are \u2018on the one hand, on the other hand\u2019. We do not support \u2018false balance\u2019. There are facts and there are judgments to be made. And we will make them where that is appropriate.\u201d Although the BBC is promising that Neil will interview party leaders one-on-one, it is still negotiating over party leader debates. Both Labour and the Conservatives are keen to only participate in head-to-head debates that exclude the Brexit party, Lib Dems and the SNP. ITV has already struck a deal for a head-to-head debate between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson on 19 November but the BBC may find it harder as a publicly funded broadcaster to exclude smaller parties. This will be one of few recent elections without the involvement of a member of the Dimbleby family, who have been central to televised coverage of British general elections since 1955, when Richard Dimbleby began hosting the BBC\u2019s programming. David Dimbleby first appeared on a BBC election night broadcast as a junior reporter in 1964 alongside his father, who died the following year. This created a 15-year interregnum during which the public had to cope without a Dimbleby hosting the broadcast before David was promoted to the top job in time for Margaret Thatcher\u2019s first victory in 1979. David\u2019s brother, Jonathan, the former host of Radio 4\u2019s Any Questions, anchored ITV\u2019s election night coverage between 1997 and 2005, meaning that for almost a decade terrestrial viewers had no choice but to learn the election results from a Dimbleby. In another first for the BBC, Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis will front the coverage of the second day, after Edwards ends his broadcast \u2013 making her the first woman to be a sole anchor of the corporation\u2019s general election programme. Previously, Edwards hosted the second day\u2019s coverage while Maitlis monitored the exit polls and results using a giant touchscreen. Although other women have been involved in the BBC\u2019s general election programmes, with Fiona Bruce being the first in 2001, it is believed that none have been the main host during the two days of coverage. Maitlis said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of a day that will be more defining of our political futures than this one. This is not just about which seats change hands, but which party leaders stay or go, whether we remain in or exit the EU, and the fundamental direction of the entire United Kingdom. We will witness first-hand what the electorate make of the choices laid before them \u2013 and I can\u2019t wait to be fronting a day that will be challenging, exhilarating, exhausting and probably game-changing.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been criticised for misleading voters over the Tories\u2019 record on the NHS, after he sent letters to voters in swing seats that selectively quoted a charity. The letter, sent out across marginal seats such as High Peak and Reading West, highlighted comments from various media sources and charities praising the long-term plan for the NHS, which was set out before Johnson took office. One of the highlighted quotes, from Sarb Bajwa, the chief executive of the British Psychological Society, lauded the plan for a \u201cclear commitment to mental health through increased spending and introducing access standards\u201d. But Johnson\u2019s letter missed off subsequent parts of the quote saying that there was \u201cstill a long way to go\u201d, though the plan showed the NHS was listening to concerns about mental health provision. It also highlighted the need for \u201cimmediate action for children and young people\u2019s services as they have become woefully underfunded and overstretched\u201d and for mental health provision outside the NHS to be resourced effectively. A BPS spokesperson said: \u201cThe BPS works to promote excellence in psychology and support the psychological workforce. We remain entirely politically neutral and were unaware that this comment had been taken from our website and used out of context as a political endorsement.\u201d Another quote on the letter comes from the BBC website, showing just the headline: \u201cNHS long-term plan: Focus on prevention \u2018could save 500,000 lives\u2019.\u201d The article refers to concerns from unions that staffing shortages could undermine the ambitions and a comment from Dr Nick Scriven, the president of the Society of Acute Medicine, saying he was \u201cstaggered\u201d that the plans overlooked acute and emergency care and hospital capacity. The British Heart Foundation, a charity also quoted in the letter, said it had not been consulted about its inclusion on the election material, but it would work with any government of the day on the NHS long-term plan, which it supported. Jonathan Ashworth, Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary, said: \u201cThe truth is the Tories have spent a decade running down our NHS, cutting over 15,000 beds, starving the NHS of cash, privatising key services and failing to recruit the extra nurses, doctors and staff needed. \u201cThey now even risk the NHS being sold off in a Trump trade deal that will cost our NHS \u00a3500m a week. No one will believe this desperate spin from Boris Johnson.\u201d The government has denied that the NHS is any way \u201cup for sale\u201d, and said it \u201ccould not agree to any proposals on medicines pricing or access that would put NHS finances at risk or reduce clinician and patient choice\u201d. Johnson has put the NHS at the centre of the Conservatives\u2019 campaign, despite Labour traditionally being more trusted on the health service and the likelihood that the government will be blamed for any winter crisis that emerges as a result of squeezed services. Tory MPs are nervous about the move, but the party\u2019s strategists believe Johnson is associated by voters with prioritising the NHS because of the highly controversial Vote Leave pledge to spend \u00a3350m a week on the health service after Brexit. On Monday, Ashworth released research showing the number of operations cancelled due to staffing issues and equipment failures in the health service had increased by a third in two years. The Conservatives contested the way he presented the information, saying Labour\u2019s own freedom of information figures showed that the number of cancelled operations overall fell last year. Earlier, Chris Hopson, the head of the organisation representing NHS trusts, called for parties to avoid \u201ccheap political slogans\u201d about health during the general election campaign, and instead engage in a rational debate about the best way to fund and manage the service. The chief executive of NHS Providers stressed that his organisation was politically neutral and not seeking to criticise any party. But pointing to examples of potentially misleading campaigning, Hopson noted that the level of NHS funding increases promised by the Conservatives would do no more than maintain current provision, rather than take the NHS to \u201csunlit uplands\u201d. Asked about Labour\u2019s warnings on NHS privatisation, Hopson said the debate on outsourcing had to be framed around the point that some private provision was seen as working well; for example, hospices. \u201cWhat really worries us, if you look back over the last four or five elections, the debates about our health and care systems have generated extreme amounts of heat and very little light,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cWhat we\u2019re very keen to do is ensure that as we start to think about that debate in the general election campaign, we frame it in the right way.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>From the politicians who reluctantly voted for it, to the millions who must now make a choice and cast their vote, everybody surely knows it: this is a very, very weird election. I mean that not just in terms of the borderline absurd timing, nor the sense that it will not resolve the fundamentals of Brexit, but much deeper tensions and contradictions.</p> <p>Large chunks of the public seem weary, and ill-disposed to both main parties; to ask a lot of people who they might vote for is to invite long sighs and eye-rolls, and suggestions that the whole thing is ridiculous. It has always been the case that when politicians, party activists and the media dissolve in excitement and passion, most people tend to keep their distance. But now the gap is so big, and political outcomes seemingly so random, that there is a resulting sense of big events happening almost by accident.</p> <p>The fact that the media carries on with rituals unchanged in 50 years \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7626753/The-10-crunch-battleground-seats-decide-2019-December-general-election.html\" title=\"\">identify the target seats!</a> <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/shelagh-fogarty/professor-john-curtice-makes-surprising-prediction/\" title=\"\">Bring on the psephologists! </a>Do 10-second vox pops! \u2013 only compounds the oddness. The best example of the absurdity of what passes for the national conversation is the attention still paid to opinion polling: on Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/general-election-poll-double-trouble-for-boris-johnson-after-bounce-in-corbyn-support-and-remain-electoral-pact-0nbttwvwd\" title=\"\">reports suggested the Tories were variously leading Labour by eight, 16 and 12 percentage points</a>. Meanwhile, Nigel Farage was on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show again. At the same time, the stakes could not be higher: one way or another, it\u2019s clear that this contest will mark a historic tipping point not just for politics, but the future of the country.</p> <p>What is it all actually about? As in 2017, there are at least three elections going on at once: the contest about Brexit \u2013 and the ludicrous idea that we will soon \u201cget it done\u201d \u2013 conceived by the Tories and pounced on by the Liberal Democrats; Labour\u2019s great debate about austerity and inequality \u2013 and the mixture of both, woven through with the question of independence, defining the battle in Scotland, and centred on the Scottish National party.</p> <p>The extent to which the public buys into these narratives is open to question: three years of anticlimactic pantomime over Brexit have only increased people\u2019s distance from politics, and 40-odd years of dealignment and waning loyalties apparently mean that <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/nearly-half-of-voters-will-switch-parties-at-next-general-election-rs7ffsf9z\" title=\"\">nearly half of us might switch to a different party from the one we backed in 2017</a>. Thanks to our creaking electoral system, support for the newly energised Lib Dems, the Brexit party and the Greens could have no end of unforeseen consequences, or very few at all. All that is certain is that those staunchly partisan voices that echo around social media are in a small, somewhat freakish minority: far more people are politically on the move, almost constantly.</p> <p>Thanks to the means we now use to communicate, what is going on is probably more complicated still.

      "bodyText": "From the politicians who reluctantly voted for it, to the millions who must now make a choice and cast their vote, everybody surely knows it: this is a very, very weird election. I mean that not just in terms of the borderline absurd timing, nor the sense that it will not resolve the fundamentals of Brexit, but much deeper tensions and contradictions. Large chunks of the public seem weary, and ill-disposed to both main parties; to ask a lot of people who they might vote for is to invite long sighs and eye-rolls, and suggestions that the whole thing is ridiculous. It has always been the case that when politicians, party activists and the media dissolve in excitement and passion, most people tend to keep their distance. But now the gap is so big, and political outcomes seemingly so random, that there is a resulting sense of big events happening almost by accident. The fact that the media carries on with rituals unchanged in 50 years \u2013 identify the target seats! Bring on the psephologists! Do 10-second vox pops! \u2013 only compounds the oddness. The best example of the absurdity of what passes for the national conversation is the attention still paid to opinion polling: on Sunday, reports suggested the Tories were variously leading Labour by eight, 16 and 12 percentage points. Meanwhile, Nigel Farage was on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show again. At the same time, the stakes could not be higher: one way or another, it\u2019s clear that this contest will mark a historic tipping point not just for politics, but the future of the country. What is it all actually about? As in 2017, there are at least three elections going on at once: the contest about Brexit \u2013 and the ludicrous idea that we will soon \u201cget it done\u201d \u2013 conceived by the Tories and pounced on by the Liberal Democrats; Labour\u2019s great debate about austerity and inequality \u2013 and the mixture of both, woven through with the question of independence, defining the battle in Scotland, and centred on the Scottish National party. The extent to which the public buys into these narratives is open to question: three years of anticlimactic pantomime over Brexit have only increased people\u2019s distance from politics, and 40-odd years of dealignment and waning loyalties apparently mean that nearly half of us might switch to a different party from the one we backed in 2017. Thanks to our creaking electoral system, support for the newly energised Lib Dems, the Brexit party and the Greens could have no end of unforeseen consequences, or very few at all. All that is certain is that those staunchly partisan voices that echo around social media are in a small, somewhat freakish minority: far more people are politically on the move, almost constantly. Thanks to the means we now use to communicate, what is going on is probably more complicated still. Thousands \u2013 millions? \u2013 of personalised micro-campaigns are already unfolding on people\u2019s social media feeds, defined by many forces and voices way beyond the party machines and the traditional media, and often beyond anyone\u2019s control. Two years ago, a big part of Theresa May\u2019s undoing was the way that an avalanche of mocking memes quickly rendered her a laughing stock; similar things will happen this time, but it is not yet clear who they will affect, and how. Twitter may have suddenly banned political advertising, but that probably means there is all the more reason for plenty of actors to use the subterfuge of bots, fake accounts, and all the rest. We know that CTF Partners, the lobbying firm run by Boris Johnson\u2019s confidant Lynton Crosby, was recently caught overseeing pro-Brexit Facebook ads purporting to be the work of grassroots activists. We know too that the Conservative party has hired people closely connected to CTF, well versed in the most slippery online campaigning techniques. This weekend brought the unsurprising news that Facebook\u2019s policy of allowing lies in political adverts will apply to the UK, which will obviously suit plenty of people just fine.

      "body": "<p>The troubled People\u2019s Vote campaign is to begin spending a \u00a31m election war chest this week despite a continuing internal feud in part about whether it should back more Labour candidates.</p> <p>More than half of the anti-Brexit campaign\u2019s staff are still on strike after the its chairman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/28/peoples-vote-senior-figures-forced-out\">Roland Rudd, sacked its chief executive, James McGrory, and its director of communications, Tom Baldwin</a>, over strategy.</p> <p>The campaign is, however, ploughing on with its attempt to influence the election by backing dozens of pro-EU MPs with thousand of pounds worth of funding. Despite its well-publicised infighting, the campaign says it has received \u00a3200,000 in donations in the last two days.</p> <p>The first recipient is set to be the former attorney general, Dominic Grieve, who is standing as an independent in his Beaconsfield constituency following his expulsion from the Conservative party over Brexit.</p> <p>Others receiving cash will be candidates on the People\u2019s Vote list of 100 marginal seats where it plans to tell remain supporters to vote tactically. Opponents of the strategy say that in some of these seats the campaign has shifted away from backing Labour candidates based on polling from the Best for Britain campaign rather its own research.</p> <p>The campaign\u2019s official tactical voting recommendations are also due to be published this week.</p> <p>Patrick Heneghan, the new chief executive of the People\u2019s Vote, said the campaign would \u201cstrain every sinew to stop Boris Johnson getting a majority\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe will be encouraging voters to get out in record numbers and back the candidate in each constituency with the best chance of defeating the Conservatives provided, at minimum, they support a People\u2019s Vote.\u201d</p> <p>The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, who backs a second referendum, urged the campaign to act on its own data. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/03/civil-war-in-peoples-vote-puts-at-risk-tactical-voting-for-referendum\">She told the Observer</a>: \u201cThis election, there will be a big tactical vote for Labour by those who want to stop Boris Johnson forcing his hard Brexit and a new era of austerity on our country. Liberal Democrat boasts that they can win hundreds of seats are not supported by the independent analysis done by the People\u2019s Vote campaign.\u201d</p> <p>The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, suggested talks over a \u201cremain alliance\u201d are continuing, after a report in the Sunday Times said a pact could be formed in up to 60 constituencies</p> <p>Swinson said the numbers were not accurate, but the concept of an alliance still stands among parties who want to prevent Brexit.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/02/brecon-radnorshire-byelection-lib-dems-jane-dodds-win-cuts-johnson-commons-majority-to-one\">Brecon and Radnorshire byelection</a> in Wales the Greens and Plaid Cymru stood down for the Lib Dem candidate, Jane Dodds, who went on to win. The area voted almost exactly 52% leave to 48% remain.</p> <p>The Lib Dems have already been announced that they will not field a candidate against Grieve in Beaconsfield.</p> <p>The party has also called for the rules on leaders\u2019 debates in elections to be written into law. This follows comments from Swinson that her exclusion from debate slots on prime time television was sexist.</p> <p>In an interview with Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News, she said: \u201cIf you look at the 2010 election and the run-up to that election, the Liberal Democrats were polling a similar amount as we are now, actually we are now much closer to the other parties in terms of the poll rating and in that election we had Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg.

      "bodyText": "The troubled People\u2019s Vote campaign is to begin spending a \u00a31m election war chest this week despite a continuing internal feud in part about whether it should back more Labour candidates. More than half of the anti-Brexit campaign\u2019s staff are still on strike after the its chairman, Roland Rudd, sacked its chief executive, James McGrory, and its director of communications, Tom Baldwin, over strategy. The campaign is, however, ploughing on with its attempt to influence the election by backing dozens of pro-EU MPs with thousand of pounds worth of funding. Despite its well-publicised infighting, the campaign says it has received \u00a3200,000 in donations in the last two days. The first recipient is set to be the former attorney general, Dominic Grieve, who is standing as an independent in his Beaconsfield constituency following his expulsion from the Conservative party over Brexit. Others receiving cash will be candidates on the People\u2019s Vote list of 100 marginal seats where it plans to tell remain supporters to vote tactically. Opponents of the strategy say that in some of these seats the campaign has shifted away from backing Labour candidates based on polling from the Best for Britain campaign rather its own research. The campaign\u2019s official tactical voting recommendations are also due to be published this week. Patrick Heneghan, the new chief executive of the People\u2019s Vote, said the campaign would \u201cstrain every sinew to stop Boris Johnson getting a majority\u201d. \u201cWe will be encouraging voters to get out in record numbers and back the candidate in each constituency with the best chance of defeating the Conservatives provided, at minimum, they support a People\u2019s Vote.\u201d The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, who backs a second referendum, urged the campaign to act on its own data. She told the Observer: \u201cThis election, there will be a big tactical vote for Labour by those who want to stop Boris Johnson forcing his hard Brexit and a new era of austerity on our country. Liberal Democrat boasts that they can win hundreds of seats are not supported by the independent analysis done by the People\u2019s Vote campaign.\u201d The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, suggested talks over a \u201cremain alliance\u201d are continuing, after a report in the Sunday Times said a pact could be formed in up to 60 constituencies Swinson said the numbers were not accurate, but the concept of an alliance still stands among parties who want to prevent Brexit. In the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection in Wales the Greens and Plaid Cymru stood down for the Lib Dem candidate, Jane Dodds, who went on to win. The area voted almost exactly 52% leave to 48% remain. The Lib Dems have already been announced that they will not field a candidate against Grieve in Beaconsfield. The party has also called for the rules on leaders\u2019 debates in elections to be written into law. This follows comments from Swinson that her exclusion from debate slots on prime time television was sexist. In an interview with Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News, she said: \u201cIf you look at the 2010 election and the run-up to that election, the Liberal Democrats were polling a similar amount as we are now, actually we are now much closer to the other parties in terms of the poll rating and in that election we had Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg. Spot the difference.\u201d Ed Davey, the Lib Dems\u2019 deputy leader, said: \u201cIt should not be in the gift of any political party to decide whether the public deserve the opportunity to scrutinise those who seek to lead this country. That is why TV debates should be mandatory, and the format should be decided by an independent commission. \u201cThe current situation in which the Labour and Conservative parties stitch up how debates work is utterly intolerable.\u201d Davey\u2019s comments come after ITV\u2019s decision that its leaders debate would be a head-to-head involving Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson. The Lib Dems have 19 seats in the current parliament. Swinson said: \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that in the vast majority of constituencies the party of remain that is going to be best placed to win that seat would be the Liberal Democrats but it is not universally the case.\u201d",
