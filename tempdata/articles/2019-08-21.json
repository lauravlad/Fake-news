Dorothy Byrne said Johnson\u2019s shift towards publishing his own videos on Facebook rather than giving sit-down interviews to journalists reminded her of the Russian president, \u201cwho also likes to talk directly to the nation\u201d.

Johnson has declined to be interviewed by the broadcaster in recent months and did not take part in Channel 4\u2019s Conservative leadership debate, with his aides casting doubt on its impartiality.

Byrne also used her speech to call out Johnson\u2019s strategy chief, Dominic Cummings, describing him as \u201cthe UK\u2019s most famous recipient of EU farming subsidies\u201d, while criticising a number of Vote Leave claims about the supposed benefits of Brexit. Byrne said it was time for the television industry to collectively demand politicians give proper interviews, suggesting Johnson was copying the tactics of \u201cMr Chlorinated Chicken himself, Donald Trump\u201d.

During a friendly press conference on his first overseas visit as PM, which was notable for the absence of any comments from Johnson or <strong>Angela Merkel</strong> critical of each other\u2019s Brexit positions, Merkel at one point appeared to set Johnson a 30 day deadline. She said that the backstop had always been a \u201cfallback position\u201d and would only come into effect if no other solution could be agreed that would protect the \u201cintegrity of the single market\u201d. She went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If one is able to solve this conundrum, if one finds this solution, we said we would probably find it in the next two years to come but we can also maybe find it in the next 30 days to come. Then we are one step further in the right direction and we have to obviously put our all into this.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Her reference to 30 days may just have been an acknowledgment that, if there is going to be a Brexit deal, the elements of it will have to be in place well in time for the next EU summit scheduled in mid-October, which means it would have to be coming together by mid-September anyway. Johnson gratefully accepted this challenge. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You [Merkel] rightly say the onus is on us to produce those solutions, those ideas, to show how we can address the issue of the Northern Irish border and that is what we want to do. I must say I am very glad listening to you tonight Angela to hear that at least the conversations that matter can now properly begin. You have set a very blistering timetable of 30 days - if I understood you correctly, I am more than happy with that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>His admission that the \u201conus\u201d was on him to find a solution was significant because until now the UK government has been arguing that it is up to the EU to shift first, by abandoning its stance on the backstop.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson claimed there was \u201cample scope\u201d for a Brexit deal.</strong> Citing <a href=\"https://www.prosperity-uk.com/aacabout/\">the report from the Alternative Arrangements Commission</a>, he said alternatives to the backstop were available. And he criticised Theresa May\u2019s government for not pushing them strongly. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think what we need to do is remove it whole and entire - the backstop - and then work, as Chancellor Merkel says, on the alternative arrangements. </p> \n   <p>There are abundant solutions which are proffered, which have already been discussed. I don\u2019t think, to be fair, they have so far been very actively proposed over the last three years by the British government. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Explaining what the ideas in the Alternative Arrangements Commission report involve, Johnson said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We do think there are alternative arrangements that could readily be used to address the problem of frictionless trade at the Northern Irish border and you\u2019ll have heard them before, whether it is trusted trader schemes or electronic pre-clearing, all that type of solution and more besides is what we will be wanting to discuss.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>David Henig</strong>, the former civil servant who heads the UK Trade Policy Project, thinks Johnson\u2019s optimism is misplaced.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DavidHenigUK/status/1164222936552738824\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Remember the EU did not think the Alternative Arrangements Commission work was a basis for replacing the backstop.

She did not use any language critical of Johnson at all, and she stressed that she remained open to any solution that might provide a workable alternative to the backstop. At one point she talked about how it might be possible to find a solution within the next 30 days and Johnson - whose entire professional training revolved around quickly spotting a headline buried in Eurobabble - immediately flagged this up to journalists, implying this was his \u201cwin\u201d from the press conference: \u201cMerkel gives UK 30 days to solve Brexit.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Whether this is anything more than cosmetic, though, remains to be seen. It may count for very little. Merkel\u2019s tone was helpful, but on substance she gave nothing away at all. The fundamental problems are just the same as they have always been, there is nothing in the Alternative Arrangements Commission report cited by Johnson that has not already been closely studied by Brussels and rejected as an inadequate alternative to the backstop, and both parties are under pressure to appear reasonable because they do not want to take the blame for the inevitable voter backlash that would follow a no-deal Brexit. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/27/donald-trump-and-theresa-may-hold-joint-white-house-press-conference-politics-live?page=with:block-588baa30e4b0860ce556955e#block-588baa30e4b0860ce556955e\">Theresa May\u2019s first press conference with Donald Trump was deemed a success.</a> But that turned out to be a very poor guide to how their relationship eventually developed.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3d98e3933030eec0963a7293ea402d539c0b00d\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3d98e3933030eec0963a7293ea402d539c0b00d/0_23_4510_2706/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel at the Chancellery in Berlin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel at the Chancellery in Berlin.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clemens Bilan/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-22T07:39:38.324Z\">at 8.39am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d5d74608f08a0805bcc20d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-21T16:45:19.738Z\">5.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Johnson says he has watched a lot of EU negotiations.</p> \n  <p>What seems impossible at first - irresistible force meets immoveable object - turns out to be possible right at the end.</p> \n  <p>He says the solutions often coming in the final furlong, when the horses change places.</p> \n  <p>In response to a question on Russia, he says he has yet to be convinced that it is right for Russia to rejoin G7.

Johnson explained his reason for using the term in <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/826166/20190819_PM_letter_to_His_Excellency_Mr_Donald_Tusk.pdf\">his letter (pdf)</a> to Donald Tusk, the European council president, on Monday. Hogan said this was a \u201cstrange\u201d decision coming from \u201can unelected prime minister\u201d. (Johnson became PM after 92,000 Tory members voted for him in a leadership contest, not after winning a general election.) Hogan went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We should recall that the backstop was agreed by a prime minister who was democratically elected.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hogan said the EU \u201cwill not buckle\u201d in response to pressure from the UK.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>From the EU side, nothing has changed.

What could possibly go wrong? Well, Basil Fawlty-style, he could start banging on about the second world war. It would not be entirely out of character. During the EU referendum campaign three years ago Johnson provoked criticism by saying that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/16/tories-divided-by-boris-johnsons-eu-hitler-comparison\">the EU had the same goal as Hitler in wanting to create an European superstate</a>, and only last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/03/tory-leadership-latest-news-boris-johnson-pmqs-accuses-of-dog-whistle-politics-over-plan-to-curb-sin-taxes-live-news?page=with:block-5d1c9c4c8f088a7392738097#block-5d1c9c4c8f088a7392738097\">one of Johnson\u2019s Tory Brexiter allies was complaining in the Commons about Germany being too powerful.</a></p> \n  <p>In reality, it is hard to imagine Johnson being quite that crass. But the war still has a powerful grip on the British public imagination (it is hard to understand the Brexit vote without reference to the second world war\u2019s place in the national story) and this surfaced again only last week when Johnson claimed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/14/johnson-hits-out-at-terrible-collaboration-of-mps-and-eu-trying-to-block-brexit\">there was \u201ca terrible collaboration going on between people who think they can block Brexit in parliament and our European friends\u201d.</a> Readers from abroad may struggle to understand what the fuss was about, but in the UK, particularly for anyone over the age of 50, it is impossible to hear the word \u201ccollaborator\u201d without associating it with supporting the Nazis.</p> \n  <p>That explains why <strong>Robert Jenrick</strong>, the housing secretary, had problems this morning when John Humprhys asked him on the Today programme if he supported Johnson\u2019s use of the word last week. At first Jenrick tried to reframe the question, saying:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The point that the prime minister was making, which I 100% agree with ...</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Humphrys tried again.

It is not in the national interest, at this moment in time, to undermine the prime minister\u2019s hand as we enter this period of negotiations.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Humphrys asked a third time if Jenrick viewed Tory MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit as collaborators. Jenrick replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What I\u2019m saying is that all members of parliament, particularly Conservatives, need to support the prime minister to help us in these final preparations ...</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Humphrys pointed out that Jenrick was continuing to avoid the question. For a fourth time, he asked if Jenrick was supporting the PM. Jenrick replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m explaining the prime minister\u2019s words, which I 100% support. I\u2019ve always believed that you have to give the prime minister the strongest hand, he can have in these negotiations. And that means ensuring that we leave on 31 October. That is the only route to a real renegotiation in the weeks ahead.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>So Jenrick claimed that he 100% supported Johnson\u2019s language \u2013 even though he obviously didn\u2019t, because he was not willing to use the word collaborator. </p> \n  <p>What Jenrick did do, though, was repeat the claim made by Johnson yesterday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/20/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnsons-backstop-offer-to-eu-dismissed-by-labour-as-fantasyland-wish-list-live-news?page=with:block-5d5c22c48f081cf11cf19f5b#block-5d5c22c48f081cf11cf19f5b\">Tory MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit were undermining the PM\u2019s renegotiation.</a></p> \n  <p>Johnson is due in Berlin at about 5pm UK time.

      "bodyText": "Here are the main points from the press conference. Boris Johnson accepted that he had 30 days to persuade the EU that there was a viable alternative to the backstop. For the first time, he seemed to accept that it was up to the UK to come up with a solution, not the EU. During a friendly press conference on his first overseas visit as PM, which was notable for the absence of any comments from Johnson or Angela Merkel critical of each other\u2019s Brexit positions, Merkel at one point appeared to set Johnson a 30 day deadline. She said that the backstop had always been a \u201cfallback position\u201d and would only come into effect if no other solution could be agreed that would protect the \u201cintegrity of the single market\u201d. She went on: If one is able to solve this conundrum, if one finds this solution, we said we would probably find it in the next two years to come but we can also maybe find it in the next 30 days to come. Then we are one step further in the right direction and we have to obviously put our all into this. Her reference to 30 days may just have been an acknowledgment that, if there is going to be a Brexit deal, the elements of it will have to be in place well in time for the next EU summit scheduled in mid-October, which means it would have to be coming together by mid-September anyway. Johnson gratefully accepted this challenge. He said: You [Merkel] rightly say the onus is on us to produce those solutions, those ideas, to show how we can address the issue of the Northern Irish border and that is what we want to do. I must say I am very glad listening to you tonight Angela to hear that at least the conversations that matter can now properly begin. You have set a very blistering timetable of 30 days - if I understood you correctly, I am more than happy with that. His admission that the \u201conus\u201d was on him to find a solution was significant because until now the UK government has been arguing that it is up to the EU to shift first, by abandoning its stance on the backstop. Johnson claimed there was \u201cample scope\u201d for a Brexit deal. Citing the report from the Alternative Arrangements Commission, he said alternatives to the backstop were available. And he criticised Theresa May\u2019s government for not pushing them strongly. He said: I think what we need to do is remove it whole and entire - the backstop - and then work, as Chancellor Merkel says, on the alternative arrangements. There are abundant solutions which are proffered, which have already been discussed. I don\u2019t think, to be fair, they have so far been very actively proposed over the last three years by the British government. Explaining what the ideas in the Alternative Arrangements Commission report involve, Johnson said: We do think there are alternative arrangements that could readily be used to address the problem of frictionless trade at the Northern Irish border and you\u2019ll have heard them before, whether it is trusted trader schemes or electronic pre-clearing, all that type of solution and more besides is what we will be wanting to discuss. David Henig, the former civil servant who heads the UK Trade Policy Project, thinks Johnson\u2019s optimism is misplaced. Johnson claimed EU negotiations often resulted in a surprise agreement at the last minute. He said: I have, in my life, watched a lot of European negotiations and, believe me, it looks at first as though it is, you know, irresistible force and immovable object. What in my experience happens is that people find a way through and I think that if we approach this with sufficient patience and optimism, as I say, we can get this done and it is in the final furlong generally when the horses change places and the winning deal appears. Henig thinks Johnson is wrong about this too. Johnson and Merkel agreed that it would not be right to readmit Russia to the G7 now. Asked about this, Johnson said: I am aware of the moves to reintegrate Russia into the G7 ... I just have to say that given what happened in Salisbury in Wiltshire, given the use of chemical weapons on British soil, given the continuing instability, civil war, the war in Ukraine, given Russia\u2019s provocations, not just in Ukraine but in many other places, I must say I am very much with Chancellor Merkel in thinking that the case has yet to be made out for Russia to return to the G7. And Merkel said: As the situation is today I would say there is not yet sufficient progress for saying the reasons we had in 2014 [for excluding Russia] are obsolete. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here is Jeremy Cliffe, the Economist\u2019s Brussels bureau chief, and former Berlin correspondent, on the Merkel/Johnson press conference. From my colleague Owen Gibson Here is the \u201c30 days\u201d quote from Angela Merkel. If one is able to solve this conundrum, if one finds this solution, we said we would probably find it in the next two years to come but we can also maybe find it in the next 30 days to come. Then we are one step further in the right direction and we have to obviously put our all into this. A reader has been in touch to explain the German phrase that Boris Johnson used during the press conference that seemed to cause Angela Merkel some amusement. (See 5.30pm.) And this is what other journalists and commentators are saying about the press conference. From the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming From the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley From the Eurasia consultancy\u2019s Mujtaba Rahman From Sky\u2019s Rob Powell From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn From the BBC\u2019s Jenny Hill From the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope I will post a summary of the main quotes from the press conference shortly. Boris Johnson will be pleased with that. Angela Merkel has always been one of the EU leaders most solicitous towards the UK in the Brexit process, and this afternoon there was a very stark contrast between her tone and that adopted, for example, by the Irish European commissioner Phil Hogan (see 3.21pm) or the unnamed French government official briefing the media (see 3.45pm). She did not use any language critical of Johnson at all, and she stressed that she remained open to any solution that might provide a workable alternative to the backstop. At one point she talked about how it might be possible to find a solution within the next 30 days and Johnson - whose entire professional training revolved around quickly spotting a headline buried in Eurobabble - immediately flagged this up to journalists, implying this was his \u201cwin\u201d from the press conference: \u201cMerkel gives UK 30 days to solve Brexit.\u201d Whether this is anything more than cosmetic, though, remains to be seen. It may count for very little. Merkel\u2019s tone was helpful, but on substance she gave nothing away at all. The fundamental problems are just the same as they have always been, there is nothing in the Alternative Arrangements Commission report cited by Johnson that has not already been closely studied by Brussels and rejected as an inadequate alternative to the backstop, and both parties are under pressure to appear reasonable because they do not want to take the blame for the inevitable voter backlash that would follow a no-deal Brexit. Theresa May\u2019s first press conference with Donald Trump was deemed a success. But that turned out to be a very poor guide to how their relationship eventually developed. Johnson says he has watched a lot of EU negotiations. What seems impossible at first - irresistible force meets immoveable object - turns out to be possible right at the end. He says the solutions often coming in the final furlong, when the horses change places. In response to a question on Russia, he says he has yet to be convinced that it is right for Russia to rejoin G7. He says this is one area where the UK and Germany agree. And that\u2019s it. Merkel says they have to get off to work. Q: Doesn\u2019t the basis problem remain - the EU will not change its position, and the UK won\u2019t either? Merkel says that question cannot be answered today. She says she sees \u201cpossibilities\u201d through changes to the political declaration. Merkel suggests changing the political declaration on the future UK-EU relationship could provide a solution to the backstop problem. Johnson says he will be discussing alternatives to the backstop with Merkel. He refers to the \u201cexcellent\u201d Alternative Arrangements Commission report which sets some of these out. Johnson says under no circumstances will the UK impose checks at the border in Ireland. The government thinks it can manage the border without checks, he says. He says he is not attracted to having a time limit on the backstop. There are other flaws with it, he says. Johnson says even with a time limit, the backstop would still be unacceptable. He says the alternatives to the backstop have not been actively proposed over the last three years by the British government. Johnson suggests May did not do enough to push alternatives to the backstop. Merkel says the commission is negotiation on behalf of the EU 27. The EU 27 want to have a uniform, consistent position, she says. She says the UK also needs to say what its ideas are. She says it is not her job as German chancellor to understand all the issues relating to the Northern Ireland/Ireland border. So it is up to the UK to suggest ideas, she says. She says she wants to protect the integrity of the single market. Q: [To Merkel] Why won\u2019t you change the backstop when it won\u2019t get through parliament? Merkel says she follows the debate in the UK. She knows the problem. But the backstop is there to solve a problem, she says. She suggests that if another solution to the border problem could be found, she would be amenable. But she suggests it would have to be workable. They have a lot to discuss tonight, she says. Q: [To Johnson] The EU says it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. So will you compromise -or is this trip just posturing before you blame the EU? Johnson says he thinks there is \u201cample scope\u201d to do a deal. Johnson says there is \u201cample scope\u201d to do a Brexit deal. He says the backstop \u201cplainly has to go\u201d. But if we can get rid of it, we can make progress very quickly indeed, he says. Boris Johnson says thank you for that \u201camazing welcome\u201d he received. He has not had one like that in his life, he says. (He has never been abroad as prime minister, so that is not particularly surprising.) Johnson says Germany and the UK are \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d. They work together in Nato, in tackling climate change, and in addressing the threats to the natural worl. This evening they will discuss Russia, China, Iran, Hong Kong - and many other subjects. And of course they are \u201cfated\u201d to discuss Brexit, he says. He says he wants to stress that he believes he can get a deal. He uses a German word to make his point, which Merkel seems to find amusing. But the UK cannot be trapped in the legal order of the EU without having any say in it, he says. That is why the backstop must be removed. He says he is absolutely committed to the protection of the 3m EU nationals in the UK. Back in the press conference Merkel says she and Johnson will be talking about foreign policy as well as about Brexit. From my colleague Kate Connelly in Berlin Angela Merkel and Boris Johnson are holding their press conference. Merkel says they have a lot on their plate to discuss. She says she hopes and prays relations with the UK will continue to be friendly after Brexit. From the Germany point of view, a negotiated Brexit would be welcome. But Germany is also prepared for a no deal, she says. Jeremy Corbyn has written to the leaders of other opposition parties, and to some backbenchers, inviting them to a meeting in his office next week to discuss what can be done to stop a no-deal Brexit. According to Labour, his letter says: Further to our correspondence last week, I would like to invite you to a meeting to discuss all tactics available to prevent no deal. The country is heading into a constitutional and political storm, so it is vital that we meet urgently, before parliament returns. The chaos and dislocation of Boris Johnson\u2019s No Deal Brexit is real and threatening, as the government\u2019s leaked Operation Yellowhammer dossier makes crystal clear. That\u2019s why we must do everything we can to stop it. I hope you are able to attend the meeting, which we will hold in my office on Tuesday 27th August at 12pm. Please confirm your attendance by email. Yours sincerely, Jeremy Corbyn The letter has gone to the following party or party group leaders at Westminster: Ian Blackford (SNP); Jo Swinson (Lib Dems); Liz Saville Roberts (Plaid Cymru); and Anna Soubry (the Independent Group for Change). It has also gone to the Green MP Caroline Lucas, the Tories Guto Bebb, Dominic Grieve and Oliver Letwin, and to the former Tory-turned-independent Nick Boles. Turning away from Berlin for a moment, the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam says that, when he was in Holyhead earlier, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said that the new government was revising the tariff schedule for a no-deal Brexit published earlier this year when Theresa May was PM. The Operation Yellowhammer report leaked at the weekend said that the plan to have zero tariffs on oil imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit would lead to the closure of two refineries in the UK, because they would no longer be able to compete. Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel will be holding a short press conference soon. According to Sky\u2019s Sam Coates, who is in Berlin, there were a few people protesting as Boris Johnson arrived. Boris Johnson has arrived. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has now arrived for the welcome ceremony. There is a live feed at the top of this blog. Here are some pictures from Berlin, where the Germans are getting ready to welcome Boris Johnson who is due to arrive at the Chancellery quite soon. France believes a no deal exit is now the \u201cmost likely\u201d Brexit scenario after Johnson demanded the EU reopen the withdrawal agreement and drop the Irish backstop. A French official said: If the UK considers that having a backstop is absolutely excluded, that is its right, but in that case it limits the possibility of reaching an agreement. The official added: The idea of saying \u2018there\u2019s not a deal, so I won\u2019t pay\u2019 does not work. We cannot imagine that a country like the UK would back out of an international commitment. From Bloomberg\u2019s Jess Shankleman This is from Jenny Hill, the BBC\u2019s Berlin correspondent. Reuters has some more news alerts from the French government briefing also attended by Bloomberg. (See 3.26pm.) They\u2019re capped up, because that\u2019s how Reuters sends them out on the news wires. EU POSITION ON BREXIT WON\u2019T CHANGE EVEN IN CASE OF PRESSURE FROM TRUMP - FRENCH OFFICIAL EVEN IN CASE OF NO-DEAL, EU WILL CONSIDER BREXIT BILL TO BE DUE - FRENCH OFFICIAL EU WOULD PROBABLY ACCEPT TO GRANT BRITAIN A DELAY ON BREXIT TO HOLD NEW ELECTIONS - FRENCH OFFICIAL BRITAIN SHOULD HAVE NO DOUBT FRANCE, GERMANY AND OTHER EU COUNTRIES ARE TOTALLY UNITED - FRENCH OFFICIAL Boris Johnson is meeting Emmanuel Macron, the French president, tomorrow, and this briefing will ratchet up the tension in advance. The point about the Brexit bill is particularly important. Johnson has repeatedly said that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the government will have an extra \u00a339bn (the Brexit bill payable to the EU) available - even though his own attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, has said that this is not true. The French government is now working on the assumption that a no-deal Brexit is the most likely outcome, Bloomberg is reporting. Phil Hogan, the European commissioner for agriculture and an Irish politician from Leo Varadkar\u2019s Fine Gael party, has launched what the Irish Independent (rightly) describes as a \u201cscathing attack\u201d on Boris Johnson. He was speaking this morning at an event in Carlingford in Ireland. Hogan\u2019s own account of his message on Twitter is bland and unexceptional. But the Irish Independent\u2019s Hugh O\u2019Connell has filed a report based on a text of what Hogan was planning to say, and the quotes are very strong. Here are the main points. Hogan said that a no-deal Brexit would create a \u201cfoul atmosphere\u201d between the UK and the EU. He said: If the UK fails to prevent a crash-out Brexit they should be under no illusion regarding the foul atmosphere they will create with their EU partners and the serious consequences this will have for negotiating any future trade agreement. He accused Johnson of \u201cgambling with peace\u201d in relation to Northern Ireland. He cited Churchill - one of Johnson\u2019s hero - to explain why a no-deal Brexit would be do damaging. Hogan said: The UK government needs to take responsibility for its choices before it is too late. Prime Minister Johnson\u2019s hero is Winston Churchill and he seems to view himself as a modern day Churchill. However, in the event of a no deal Brexit, the UK government\u2019s only Churchilian legacy will be \u2013\u2018never have so few done so much damage to so many\u2019. Hogan dismissed Johnson as an \u201cunelected prime minister\u201d. EU leaders have been angered by Johnson\u2019s decision to describe the backstop as \u201cundemocratic\u201d, despite the fact that it was agreed by EU leaders and Theresa May, implementing a commitment made by the UK government in the joint report of December 2017 when Johnson was foreign secretary. Johnson explained his reason for using the term in his letter (pdf) to Donald Tusk, the European council president, on Monday. Hogan said this was a \u201cstrange\u201d decision coming from \u201can unelected prime minister\u201d. (Johnson became PM after 92,000 Tory members voted for him in a leadership contest, not after winning a general election.) Hogan went on: We should recall that the backstop was agreed by a prime minister who was democratically elected. Hogan said the EU \u201cwill not buckle\u201d in response to pressure from the UK. He said: From the EU side, nothing has changed. We will hold the line. We have made detailed contingency plans for every outcome and we will not be found wanting. Contrary to what the UK government may wish, the EU will not buckle. Our response to Prime Minister Johnson\u2019s letter is simple: We share his stated commitment to an orderly Brexit and to upholding the Good Friday agreement. We reiterate that the backstop is a necessary, legally operative solution to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland and we deeply regret that the new UK government wants to replace a legally operative solution with a commitment to try to find a solution - yet to be found- by the end of the transition period. He accused Johnson of putting \u201cthe best interests of the Tory Party ahead of the best interests of the UK\u201d. He said, three years after the vote to leave the EU, Brussels still did not know what kind of Brexit Britain wanted. He said: More than three years on from the referendum, we still have no clear idea about what kind of Brexit the UK wants. And the UK is running out of time to make up its mind. This is from my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels. Speaking during his visit to the port of Holyhead Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal Brexit planning, was also asked what he thought the chances of no deal were. He replied: Different people put a different statistical likelihood on it. My view is that there is a chance that it might happen therefore we need to be ready for it and many of the things that we would do anyway as we leave the single market and the customs union we would do or need to do in the event of leaving without a deal. He also stressed that \u201cgoodwill on all sides\u201d would be required for the \u201calternative arrangements\u201d favoured by the government as a replacement for the backstop in Northern Ireland to work. He explained: There are a series of particular facilitations and easements that can be introduced alongside technology which can help ensure that we have as effective a flow of goods over the Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland border as businesses will need. It all depends on the willingness of the EU, in particular the European commission, to commit to making sure that some of the work that\u2019s already being done is expedited. Asked if it would be possible for that work to be done before October 31, Gove replied: If the EU commit to this approach then it\u2019s perfectly possible for us to have a transition or implementation period and then to work on all the steps that are required in order to give confidence that we can continue to have a solution of the island of Ireland that works in everyone\u2019s interest. As the anti-Brexit campaign group, Led By Donkeys, has been pointing out this month, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal Brexit planning, has in the past admitted that no deal would be undesirable. Today, on a visit to Holyhead in Wales, where he was inspecting Brexit planning at the port, he stressed that he still wanted a deal with the EU. Asked about his previous comments about a no-deal Brexit, he told the BBC: Well, we have to leave. We voted to leave ... I\u2019ve made it clear throughout that we have to honour the vote. Politicians don\u2019t get to choose the votes that they honour. People voted to leave. It is better to leave with a deal. That is the government\u2019s policy. But if the choice is no Brexit or Brexit and no deal, then I would choose Brexit and no deal, and I\u2019ve always been clear on that point. EU net migration to the UK is higher than previously thought, the Office for National Statistics has admitted, prompting experts to claim that the numbers have been \u201csystematically\u201d under-estimated. As the Press Association reports, the ONS said it under-estimated levels of EU migration to the UK, affecting figures on the number of migrants from EU8 countries - like Poland - since 2016. Migration from countries outside the EU has been over-stated, the ONS added. In an announcement it said: In the year ending March 2016 - the latest point at which we have adjusted data available - EU net migration is around 16% higher than our published estimate. In the year ending March 2016, net migration is around 13% lower than our published estimate. As a result the ONS has downgraded the status of its quarterly immigration figures it compiles to \u201cexperimental\u201d, the Press Association reports. Boris Johnson has been making a series of election-style announcements since he became prime minister, and Number 10 must have been hoping to see Conservative poll ratings lift as a result. The evidence suggests he is having some effect. In a post on his UK Polling Report blog yesterday Anthony Wells listed the five August polls then available, all giving the Tories a lead over Labour varying from three points to nine points. \u201cWe\u2019re now at a point where the most recent polls from all the regular polling companies show the Conservatives back ahead,\u201d Wells wrote. Since then there have been two more polls giving the Tories a big lead. Last night YouGov released a second August poll, putting the Conservatives on 30% and Labour on 21%. And today Kantar has released a poll suggesting the Tories are 14 points ahead. It puts them on 42%, with Labour on 28%, the Lib Dems on 15% and the Brexit party on 5%. Jo Swinson, the new Lib Dem leader, has appointed what she describes as a shadow cabinet (which is not to be confused with the shadow cabinet, the one appointed by Jeremy Corbyn). Sir Ed Davey, her rival for the leadership, will speak for the party on Treasury and business matters. Chuka Umunna, the former Labour MP who had been holding the Treasury brief, will speak for the party on foreign affairs, international development and international trade. And Christine Jardine will speak for the party will speak for the party on home affairs, justice and equalities. Sir Vince Cable, the former leader, will speak for the party on health and social care. The full list of appointments is here. The EU27 are united over Brexit, the European commission said today. At its regular daily briefing, commenting on Boris Johnson\u2019s meetings with Angela Merkel this evening and Emmanuel Macron tomorrow, the commission spokeswoman, Natasha Bertaud, said: It\u2019s normal that our member states meet and talk to one another. Beyond this, the EU27 have had from the outset - and continue to have now - one single, united position on Brexit matters. A major critic of the HS2 scheme has been appointed deputy chair of the government review of its viability launched today, my colleague Gwyn Topham reports. Lord Berkeley, a railway expert and Labour peer, has repeatedly challenged the Department for Transport\u2019s cost figures and warned that the budgets were spiralling out of control. Here is Gwyn\u2019s story. Number 10 is knocking down the Sun story claiming Boris Johnson would like Ireland to temporarily derogate from the EU single market (see 10.17am), according to the Brexit specialist Mujtaba Rahman from the Eurasia consultancy. A former German ambassador to the UK, Thomas Matussek, told the Today programme this morning, that British ministers could be \u201cin for a nasty surprise\u201d if they think the EU will make Brexit concessions at the last minute. Asked about the possibility of the EU backing down, he said: Well I think this time it might be wrong [to assume the EU will shift at the last minute] because I think it\u2019s important, if you try to put yourself into the shoes of your partner, and the clear assessment of the interests of both sides indicate that there are certain issues on which the EU cannot budge and these are the four freedoms. So I think they might be in for a nasty surprise. The EU was committed to the backstop, he explained. We cannot throw Ireland under the bus. What message would that send to other members of the EU family if we gave up that sort of loyalty and solidarity? Gerald Vernon-Jackson, the leader of Portsmouth council, has called the government\u2019s \u00a39m no-deal funding pledge to councils \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d and said his own council alone had spent \u00a34m preparing the port for potentially thousands more lorries attempting to exit, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister and minister for foreign affairs, told RTE\u2019s Radio One this morning that a no-deal Brexit was becoming \u201cfar more likely\u201d. He explained: There is a consequence to the approach that the British government is taking and that consequence is that they are making a no-deal far more likely. There is a reason why Boris Johnson is visiting Berlin today and Paris tomorrow, to try to talk to EU leaders about finding a way forward. I think he will get a very consistent message from EU leaders that the negotiations over the last two to three years are not going to be abandoned now. We will try and find a way to give the reassurance and clarification that Boris Johnson needs to sell a deal. We will try and be imaginative about that and be helpful on that. Coveney also insisted that Ireland would not abandon the backstop just on the basis of a \u201cpromise\u201d from Boris Johnson that the UK and the EU might find an alternative means of avoiding a hard border in the future. He said: We are not going to abandon a solution that we know works for some kind of promise on the basis of trust that we will all work together to try and find a solution and muddle on in the future to solve the border. If we do that, what we will be doing is we will creating collateral damage in Ireland to solve a problem in Westminster and for the next number of years, the border issue will dominate Irish politics, north and south because we haven\u2019t resolved it in the way we that know we can. We are not in the business of facilitating the UK effectively moving away from commitments they have made to Ireland and the EU to protect the Good Friday agreement, to protect an all-island economy, and to replace that with some sort of make-shift deal in the weeks before a no-deal, that isn\u2019t what we are going to do. During the Tory leadership contest Boris Johnson said he wanted to review the case for HS2. That review is now going ahead. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has announced it in a statement this morning. The review will be conducted by the former HS2 Ltd chairman Douglas Oakervee and it will the consider \u201cwhether and how HS2 should proceed\u201d. The full terms of reference are here (pdf). Shapps said: The prime minister has been clear that transport infrastructure has the potential to drive economic growth, redistribute opportunity and support towns and cities across the UK, but that investments must be subject to continuous assessment of their costs and benefits. That\u2019s why we are undertaking this independent and rigorous review of HS2. Douglas Oakervee and his expert panel will consider all the evidence available, and provide the department with clear advice on the future of the project. The terms of reference make it clear that cancelling the whole project would be an option. During the leadership contest there were claims that, in his private meetings with Tory MPs, Johnson was giving some of them the impression that he wanted to continue with HS2, while leaving others with the impression that he wanted to scrap the project. On the subject of the backstop, Jon Sopel, the BBC\u2019s North America editor, has an imaginative solution. Sopel is, of course, joking. But, according to the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn, Boris Johnson is considering a plan almost as improbable. Newton Dunn says the PM believes the backstop problem could be solved not by Northern Ireland remaining in the EU single market, but by Ireland leaving it (temporarily). Perhaps this is a joke too, but these days it is getting hard to tell ... Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, chair of the German parliament\u2019s foreign affairs committee and an Angela Merkel ally, has used Twitter this morning to restate his view (reported in our overnight story) that Boris Johnson would have been better off not writing the letter to Donald Tusk released on Monday. Robert Jenrick, a former Treasury minister, was promoted to the cabinet as housing secretary after supporting Boris Johnson enthusiastically in the Tory leadership contest. But his performance on the Today programme this morning is getting some harsh reviews on Twitter. From the former Sun editor David Yelland From the Times columnist David Aaronovitich From the Labour MP Barry Sheerman From the former Labour Europe minister Denis MacShane Boris Johnson is making his first visit abroad as prime minister today when he visits Berlin for dinner with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. What could possibly go wrong? Well, Basil Fawlty-style, he could start banging on about the second world war. It would not be entirely out of character. During the EU referendum campaign three years ago Johnson provoked criticism by saying that the EU had the same goal as Hitler in wanting to create an European superstate, and only last month one of Johnson\u2019s Tory Brexiter allies was complaining in the Commons about Germany being too powerful. In reality, it is hard to imagine Johnson being quite that crass. But the war still has a powerful grip on the British public imagination (it is hard to understand the Brexit vote without reference to the second world war\u2019s place in the national story) and this surfaced again only last week when Johnson claimed there was \u201ca terrible collaboration going on between people who think they can block Brexit in parliament and our European friends\u201d. Readers from abroad may struggle to understand what the fuss was about, but in the UK, particularly for anyone over the age of 50, it is impossible to hear the word \u201ccollaborator\u201d without associating it with supporting the Nazis. That explains why Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, had problems this morning when John Humprhys asked him on the Today programme if he supported Johnson\u2019s use of the word last week. At first Jenrick tried to reframe the question, saying: The point that the prime minister was making, which I 100% agree with ... Humphrys tried again. Did Jenrick agree with the use of the word collaboration? Jenrick replied: I agree with the prime minister ... It is not in the national interest, at this moment in time, to undermine the prime minister\u2019s hand as we enter this period of negotiations. Humphrys asked a third time if Jenrick viewed Tory MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit as collaborators. Jenrick replied: What I\u2019m saying is that all members of parliament, particularly Conservatives, need to support the prime minister to help us in these final preparations ... Humphrys pointed out that Jenrick was continuing to avoid the question. For a fourth time, he asked if Jenrick was supporting the PM. Jenrick replied: I\u2019m explaining the prime minister\u2019s words, which I 100% support. I\u2019ve always believed that you have to give the prime minister the strongest hand, he can have in these negotiations. And that means ensuring that we leave on 31 October. That is the only route to a real renegotiation in the weeks ahead. So Jenrick claimed that he 100% supported Johnson\u2019s language \u2013 even though he obviously didn\u2019t, because he was not willing to use the word collaborator. What Jenrick did do, though, was repeat the claim made by Johnson yesterday that Tory MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit were undermining the PM\u2019s renegotiation. Johnson is due in Berlin at about 5pm UK time. Here is my colleague Philip Oltermann\u2019s preview story. There is not a lot else in the diary today, although Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, is visiting Holyhead port to review preparations for a no-deal Brexit. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "body": "<p>The historian <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/A-J-P-Taylor\" title=\"\">AJP Taylor</a> argued that Europe was plunged into the first world war by the inexorable operation of train timetables. He was not ignoring historic rivalries between the continent\u2019s great powers, nor truncating the sequence of diplomatic failures that turned competition into military confrontation. But at a critical moment, carefully laid mobilisation plans could not be deactivated. Escalation to calamity proceeded metaphorically and literally on rails.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even with a century of hindsight it is impossible to discern a point of no return in the runup to the first world war</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Reading about the summer of 1914 in the summer of 2019 is salutary in conflicting ways. It is a reminder to keep anxiety about Brexit in perspective. There are times when the language of bloody apocalypse is justified. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/18/cost-no-deal-mps-operation-yellowhammer-brexit\" title=\"\">Operation Yellowhammer</a> is not one of them. But there are echoes of an older, bloodier emergency: the nation\u2019s course irreversibly changed by a combination of cultural complacency, political pomposity, bogus patriotism and unthinking submission to the timetable.</p> <p>Years before Archduke Franz Ferdinand was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/08/first-world-war-franz-ferdinand-sarajevo\" title=\"\">assassinated</a>, most statesmen across the continent thought a European war would sooner or later have to be fought. Some expected it would be glorious and short. Others anticipated the horror but said it would be spiritually purgative. As martial drums grew louder, pacifist voices grew fainter. A fog of fatalism descended. The nature of the question shifted from averting possible cataclysm to managing one that seemed inevitable.</p> <p>Even with a century of hindsight it is impossible to discern a point of no return, a junction at which all future paths, by whatever gradient or circuitous route, converged on disaster. If history doesn\u2019t afford that view, how are we to know in real time when such a moment is close, or has been passed?</p> <p>Sometimes a weight of bad choices already made presses down on politicians, driving them deeper into an error that they see plainly enough. \u201cI am in blood/ Stepped in so far that should I wade no more/ Returning were as tedious as go o\u2019er,\u201d Macbeth tells his wife at the midpoint of his tragedy.</p> <p>There is a less poetic version of the same thought captured on a 1964 tape-recording of a conversation between United States president Lyndon Johnson and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/McGeorge-Bundy\" title=\"\">McGeorge Bundy</a>, his national security adviser. The choice was between propping up the corrupt South Vietnamese regime or abandoning it to the Viet Cong. One path led to military quagmire, the other to pillory at home for surrendering Asia to communism. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth fighting for and I don\u2019t think we can get out,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest damn mess.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/20/brexit-free-movement-cutoff-plans-worse-than-windrush-says-abbott\">Brexit free-movement cutoff plans worse than Windrush, says Abbott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What felt like limited choices was really the limit placed on imagination by misjudgments inherited from predecessors: military hubris, ignorance of Vietnamese history, misapplication of cold war ideology to a post-colonial liberation struggle. Johnson then added his own mistakes. By the time US national humiliation was complete in the mid-1970s, it was a bipartisan monument assembled across political generations.</p> <p>Brexit is not a military atrocity, and there is no moral equivalence implied by comparison with Vietnam. Still, I sense that our incumbent Johnson is also trapped in the midway point of a longer tragedy, the parameters of which we are unable to grasp. That perspective will always elude the prime minister because he adheres to the 19th-century view that history is made by great men (and is enough of a narcissist to count himself among them).</p> <p>Intuitively, the return of parliament next month feels like the beginning of a final act. In truth, we cannot plot the current moment on a narrative arc that bends out of sight into the future. Many pro-Europeans expected that by this point public opinion would have shifted definitively against Brexit. The strategic folly of surrendering a lead role in a continental power bloc was advertised in every scene during the article 50 negotiations, alongside lurid examples of prominent leavers\u2019 mendacity. But the great Damascene moment has not come. It might never come. An orderly transition is still available. Gloomy forecasts can be wrong. In turbulent scenarios there will be foreign capitals, collaborationist civil servants and defeatist remainers to blame.</p> <p>Zoom out still further, and Brexit could look like the prelude to a wider unravelling. If the European project is rattled by financial crisis and fractured by vandalistic nationalism, the debate will be whether Britain was wise to get out when it did, or criminal in failing to stay at the critical juncture. One side will celebrate Brexit as a heroic leap from the fire escape, the other will deplore it as the arsonist spark that ignited an inferno.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/20/donald-tusk-rejects-boris-johnsons-bid-to-remove-the-backstop-brexit\">Donald Tusk rejects Boris Johnson request to remove backstop</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If, by contrast, the EU is resilient and our neighbours flourish, it might still take many years for the foolishness of Britain\u2019s self-relegation to be accepted as fact. The error will have to be composted under a layer of events, mulched by transitions of power until it beds down as consensus. Sometimes it needs a new generation of politicians to call some policy a bad business from the start because they weren\u2019t there at the start.</p> <p>We are transfixed by frenzy on the stage before us: manoeuvres in anticipation of a no-confidence vote. We suppose that all possible routes are still open. Pro-Europeans must hope that there is a way back, that it is not a just a choice of gradient on the downward slide. Yet I sense fatalism creeping into formerly strident anti-Brexit voices. I glimpse shudders of dread that events are being driven not by the MPs who will vote in the coming weeks but by a critical mass of cowardice, ignorance and ideological prejudice that was reached months ago, maybe years. The past is harrying the present.</p> <p>It could be an illusion. I hope I am wrong. But already it feels as if decisions not yet taken this autumn are shrouded in a mist of inevitability \u2013 the accretion of a million mistakes already made. Looking back, maybe historians will judge that the point of no return, the laying of the rails, happened long before the summer of 2019.</p> <p>\u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "The historian AJP Taylor argued that Europe was plunged into the first world war by the inexorable operation of train timetables. He was not ignoring historic rivalries between the continent\u2019s great powers, nor truncating the sequence of diplomatic failures that turned competition into military confrontation. But at a critical moment, carefully laid mobilisation plans could not be deactivated. Escalation to calamity proceeded metaphorically and literally on rails. Reading about the summer of 1914 in the summer of 2019 is salutary in conflicting ways. It is a reminder to keep anxiety about Brexit in perspective. There are times when the language of bloody apocalypse is justified. Operation Yellowhammer is not one of them. But there are echoes of an older, bloodier emergency: the nation\u2019s course irreversibly changed by a combination of cultural complacency, political pomposity, bogus patriotism and unthinking submission to the timetable. Years before Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated, most statesmen across the continent thought a European war would sooner or later have to be fought. Some expected it would be glorious and short. Others anticipated the horror but said it would be spiritually purgative. As martial drums grew louder, pacifist voices grew fainter. A fog of fatalism descended. The nature of the question shifted from averting possible cataclysm to managing one that seemed inevitable. Even with a century of hindsight it is impossible to discern a point of no return, a junction at which all future paths, by whatever gradient or circuitous route, converged on disaster. If history doesn\u2019t afford that view, how are we to know in real time when such a moment is close, or has been passed? Sometimes a weight of bad choices already made presses down on politicians, driving them deeper into an error that they see plainly enough. \u201cI am in blood/ Stepped in so far that should I wade no more/ Returning were as tedious as go o\u2019er,\u201d Macbeth tells his wife at the midpoint of his tragedy. There is a less poetic version of the same thought captured on a 1964 tape-recording of a conversation between United States president Lyndon Johnson and McGeorge Bundy, his national security adviser. The choice was between propping up the corrupt South Vietnamese regime or abandoning it to the Viet Cong. One path led to military quagmire, the other to pillory at home for surrendering Asia to communism. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth fighting for and I don\u2019t think we can get out,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest damn mess.\u201d What felt like limited choices was really the limit placed on imagination by misjudgments inherited from predecessors: military hubris, ignorance of Vietnamese history, misapplication of cold war ideology to a post-colonial liberation struggle. Johnson then added his own mistakes. By the time US national humiliation was complete in the mid-1970s, it was a bipartisan monument assembled across political generations. Brexit is not a military atrocity, and there is no moral equivalence implied by comparison with Vietnam. Still, I sense that our incumbent Johnson is also trapped in the midway point of a longer tragedy, the parameters of which we are unable to grasp. That perspective will always elude the prime minister because he adheres to the 19th-century view that history is made by great men (and is enough of a narcissist to count himself among them). Intuitively, the return of parliament next month feels like the beginning of a final act. In truth, we cannot plot the current moment on a narrative arc that bends out of sight into the future. Many pro-Europeans expected that by this point public opinion would have shifted definitively against Brexit. The strategic folly of surrendering a lead role in a continental power bloc was advertised in every scene during the article 50 negotiations, alongside lurid examples of prominent leavers\u2019 mendacity. But the great Damascene moment has not come. It might never come. An orderly transition is still available. Gloomy forecasts can be wrong. In turbulent scenarios there will be foreign capitals, collaborationist civil servants and defeatist remainers to blame. Zoom out still further, and Brexit could look like the prelude to a wider unravelling. If the European project is rattled by financial crisis and fractured by vandalistic nationalism, the debate will be whether Britain was wise to get out when it did, or criminal in failing to stay at the critical juncture. One side will celebrate Brexit as a heroic leap from the fire escape, the other will deplore it as the arsonist spark that ignited an inferno. If, by contrast, the EU is resilient and our neighbours flourish, it might still take many years for the foolishness of Britain\u2019s self-relegation to be accepted as fact. The error will have to be composted under a layer of events, mulched by transitions of power until it beds down as consensus. Sometimes it needs a new generation of politicians to call some policy a bad business from the start because they weren\u2019t there at the start. We are transfixed by frenzy on the stage before us: manoeuvres in anticipation of a no-confidence vote. We suppose that all possible routes are still open. Pro-Europeans must hope that there is a way back, that it is not a just a choice of gradient on the downward slide. Yet I sense fatalism creeping into formerly strident anti-Brexit voices. I glimpse shudders of dread that events are being driven not by the MPs who will vote in the coming weeks but by a critical mass of cowardice, ignorance and ideological prejudice that was reached months ago, maybe years. The past is harrying the present. It could be an illusion. I hope I am wrong. But already it feels as if decisions not yet taken this autumn are shrouded in a mist of inevitability \u2013 the accretion of a million mistakes already made. Looking back, maybe historians will judge that the point of no return, the laying of the rails, happened long before the summer of 2019. \u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

In a four-page letter published on Monday night, Johnson called on the EU to scrap the backstop, calling the last-resort solution for a seamless border on the island of Ireland anti-democratic and \u201cinconsistent with the sovereignty of the UK as a state\u201d. The British prime minister\u2019s first official proposal to the EU since taking office last month has been met with responses ranging from indifference to incredulity in the German capital, with senior officials saying it showed Westminster\u2019s debate on the withdrawal agreement to be stuck on the same arguments of the so-called Brady amendment, which the EU rejected in January. \u201cThe British prime minister starts his letter by saying he is personally committed to finding an agreement, but there is no sign in the rest of the letter that this is actually the case,\u201d said R\u00f6ttgen, a delegate for the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU). \u201cTo suggest the backstop could weaken the Good Friday agreement \u2013 that\u2019s strong stuff. \u201cIf Johnson really wanted to achieve something on his visits to Paris and Berlin, he would have been well advised against writing this letter.\u201d Johnson will receive military honours outside Angela Merkel\u2019s chancellory at 6pm CET on Wednesday, followed by a meeting in which the two leaders will discuss bilateral and European policy issues. \u201cMerkel is politically and emotionally well inclined towards the British, and her willingness to maintain friendly relations between the two countries will be on display on Wednesday,\u201d said R\u00f6ttgen. \u201cBut the extent to which the Johnson government is prepared to humiliate itself for a trade deal with the USA has not gone unnoticed in Berlin.\u201d A failure to reach an agreement over the terms of Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union would lead to the UK crashing out of the bloc on 31 October.

Legislation has been prepared to ensure British people and their family members living in Germany will receive residence permits if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, irrespective of the Home Office\u2019s latest plans for EU citizens in the UK. Behind the scenes, however, there are concerns that the potential crises emerging from a hard Brexit are too complex to be adequately prepared for, and that Germany\u2019s export-focused economy could be fatally hit at a time when it is already being squeezed by a trade war between China and the US.
