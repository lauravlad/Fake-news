      "body": "<p>So, Boris Johnson fears that the Conservatives may face extinction if they delay Brexit (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/04/boris-johnson-tories-must-deliver-brexit-or-face-extinction\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 5 June). He may be right, on this at least, but for the wrong reasons. The fact is that the decline of the Conservatives, and of Labour, is a long-term process which began 60 years ago and may only now have reached its culmination. Both main parties have underestimated the consequences of this decline. The result is that the transformation in party voting seen in the Euro elections and since may be permanent.</p> <p>British politics has long been seen as dominated by two big parties, each with a block of loyal supporters, and a small number of \u201cfloating\u201d voters between them. This was an accurate picture of elections in the early 1950s, when over 80% of the electorate voted Labour or Tory. But this two-party domination began to weaken from the late 50s, a trend that has continued ever since. Turnout fell as fewer people were enthused by the main parties. The growth of this pool of unattached electors gave space for Liberal and Liberal/SDP \u201crevivals\u201d, the growth of nationalist parties in Scotland and Wales, and now the rise of the Green party and the Ukip/Farage phenomenon.</p> <p>The decay of two-party domination had been obscured by the first-past-the-post voting system, with changes in voting not fully reflected in parliament. Certainly, the fall in turnout, and in electoral registration, had no apparent political impact. But most people are no longer loyal Labour or Tory voters. The traditional sources of loyalty to these two parties, based partly on social class, are now not the main motivation in voting.</p> <p>The referendum revealed a new and passionate division between two broadly equal-sized parts of the electorate. This cleavage is based on real divisions of interest and between sets of values. The intensity of the feelings on both sides has pushed the remnants of former loyalties aside, and this change is probably permanent. Neither Labour nor the Conservative party is unambiguously identified with one or other side of this new fundamental cleavage in British political opinion.

Modern conservatism and social democracy/socialism arise from the class struggles characterising late 19th- and 20th-century mass industrial society. The core question was how to distribute wealth through variations in property ownership and rights. The growth-based economic model, within which that debate was centred, is being overtaken by the reality of climate emergency.</p> <p>This involves a completely new mindset and culture. The political future requires replacing the residual elements of the \u201cgrowth society\u201d, with its emphasis on consumption \u2013 whether individual or collective \u2013 and the freedom to do so, with the \u201csustainable society\u201d, a post-consumerist society where social justice hangs on the ability of society to preserve the environment and harness technology to this overarching aim. Social democracy/socialism has to ditch its obsession with industrial growth and contribute its traditional emphasis on social justice. It must add itself to the green movement.</p> <p>Part of the process of getting there requires, sadly, a preliminary conflict between the emerging green movement and the reactionary last gasps of conservatism, displayed by nationalist populist parties, whose chief characteristic is to act as a brake on social change often accompanied by climate emergency denial.
