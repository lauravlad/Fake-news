Since then, the Conservative party\u2019s rightwing nationalists have repeatedly tried to defeat the deal and to oust May. They have dominated the airwaves and won some famous victories along the way, but in the end, they have decisively lost the war.</p> \n<p>For the right, the aim was to bend the Tory party to their obsessional will. They have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/11/ignore-backbenchers-jacob-rees-mogg-may-tells-eu\" title=\"\">failed to do that</a>. Instead they may have wrecked their party.</p> \n<p>Their aim too was to drive the UK out of the EU without a deal of the kind signed by May or any of the economic safeguards Labour and other opponents demand. That is not now going to happen. Wednesday\u2019s agreement in Brussels makes that clear.</p> \n<p>May and her deal are very badly battered. But they both survive. The rightwing nationalists react as if these are mere details. They talk as if they will still capture the party leadership over breakfast, rewrite the Brexit deal at lunchtime, abolish the Northern Ireland backstop at tea, and win a general election on a populist English nationalist and deregulatory platform in the evening. It is all a fantasy. They have lost. Their strategy is bust.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f548612f-9f39-489e-92d5-4e18715022eb\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Donald Tusk has proposed a 'flexible extension' to Article 50. Under the plan the UK\u2019s nominal last day in the EU would likely be 10 April 2020, but Britain would be expected to leave well before then, as soon as a withdrawal agree had been ratified by the UK parliament.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Their bravado comes from a failure to understand the subtle change in mood that is happening in parliament and, to a degree, in the country. Even if they capture the leadership, which is not certain, their other triumphs are wholly imaginary. There is no majority for no deal among Tories, let alone among MPs more generally. On the contrary, the majority against the go-it-aloners is growing. Their bluff has been called, and they are too foolish and too dogmatic to realise it.</p> \n<p>May\u2019s decision to open talks with Labour was a watershed. Its importance was widely underestimated, because May herself is underestimated, albeit for understandable reasons. In fact, the approach to Labour marked May\u2019s acceptance that the Tory-facing Brexit strategy she had pursued for 30 months had failed. The EU leaders see this, even if the British political class sometimes fails to. It was one of the key factors in another notably statesmanlike approach by the EU27 in Brussels and by Donald Tusk in particular.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6c273031-e13e-4a58-b1e7-65cabeda069c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_mT75X8xJ54?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The object of her turn towards Labour is to find a more moderate Brexit that Labour and others could vote for. The possibility that she may succeed in doing this is too easily dismissed. These talks matter. May refuses to talk about erasing red lines, but it will have to happen \u2013 and it is. There is little doubt that the two big parties are fairly close on some form of customs union. The EU has explicitly said it would accept that.</p> \n<p>Another key point is the need to stop any future hard-Brexiteer Tory leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/11/ignore-backbenchers-jacob-rees-mogg-may-tells-eu\" title=\"\">shredding a bipartisan agreement</a>. This issue is causing trouble in the talks. The simplest answer is for the Tories not to vote for such a leader in the first place, or for the public to defeat them in a general election. Another would be to give the deal treaty status with the EU. But why not also require any major change of policy to obtain the support of all four constituent parts of the United Kingdom before it can be implemented? No unionist could oppose that. Even the SNP would have to back it.</p> \n<p>May\u2019s turn to Labour has also opened up possibilities that she has always adamantly opposed. Much the most important is that, merely by talking, she has put a second referendum \u2013 in which Britain may vote to remain \u2013 into the realms of the possible for the first time since 2016.</p> \n<p>Jeremy Corbyn does not want Britain to remain in the EU either. But his party overwhelmingly does, and the wider public mood on this issue is growing much more insistent. A second vote is the only realistic means of obtaining that outcome. And Labour has to keep its soft Brexit supporters and its anti-Brexit supporters on board. So any Tory-Labour agreement, therefore, has to address the second vote issue in some way.</p> \n<p>There are many options on this. May\u2019s mantra in her Commons statement today was that it can be raised as an amendment to any wider agreement. But a much stronger commitment would probably be a precondition for any Labour buy-in. Most Labour people want no Brexit rather than a softer one, so a second vote will be a decisive issue when the talks resume. The point to note is that the issue has now reached the top table.</p> \n<p>May faces a dilemma over timetabling. The Tory party is desperate not to hold European elections on 23 May. It fears derision, desertion and defeat if it has to go through with them. May made her own opposition explicit in her <a href=\"https://content.guardianapis.com/atom/media/6c273031-e13e-4a58-b1e7-65cabeda069c\" title=\"\">Commons statement</a>. Labour can probably be a bit more sanguine \u2013 the polls look less bad for them. Ministers therefore fear that Labour will spin the process out, so the government is forced to make further concessions.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/11/what-does-the-brexit-delay-mean-for-politics-business-and-citizens\">What does a Brexit delay mean for politics, business, citizens and the EU?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But 23 May could be an opportunity too. Most previous European elections have contained no debate at all about Europe, with the contests seen as an opportunity to kick the governing parties without suffering any penalty. This time could be very different, since there would be an intense argument about Europe, and the parties would face serious questions about their policies. That would be tough for both the Tories and Labour \u2013 and rightly so.</p> \n<p>Today, the Berlin-based <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.eu/page/ECFR281_EU_COHESION_MONITOR_2019.pdf?amp%3Bqid=6615638\" title=\"\">European Council on Foreign Relations</a> published research showing British attitudes towards the European project have become more positive over the past decade. The UK is second only to Finland in feeling increasingly European. The 2016 referendum may have done more for our European consciousness than all the preceding years of neglect.</p> \n<p>The one big plus of the past five months is that British voters have become much better informed about Europe and have thought more deeply about the issues. Last month\u2019s march and parliamentary petitions showed the effect. So did the quality of those long House of Commons debates. There seems little doubt about the direction in which public opinion is gradually moving. These European elections could reflect it. It is time to be more confident again about Britain\u2019s place in Europe. It\u2019s time to go for it.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p>",

It was one of the key factors in another notably statesmanlike approach by the EU27 in Brussels and by Donald Tusk in particular. The object of her turn towards Labour is to find a more moderate Brexit that Labour and others could vote for. The possibility that she may succeed in doing this is too easily dismissed. These talks matter. May refuses to talk about erasing red lines, but it will have to happen \u2013 and it is. There is little doubt that the two big parties are fairly close on some form of customs union. The EU has explicitly said it would accept that. Another key point is the need to stop any future hard-Brexiteer Tory leader shredding a bipartisan agreement. This issue is causing trouble in the talks. The simplest answer is for the Tories not to vote for such a leader in the first place, or for the public to defeat them in a general election. Another would be to give the deal treaty status with the EU. But why not also require any major change of policy to obtain the support of all four constituent parts of the United Kingdom before it can be implemented? No unionist could oppose that. Even the SNP would have to back it. May\u2019s turn to Labour has also opened up possibilities that she has always adamantly opposed. Much the most important is that, merely by talking, she has put a second referendum \u2013 in which Britain may vote to remain \u2013 into the realms of the possible for the first time since 2016. Jeremy Corbyn does not want Britain to remain in the EU either. But his party overwhelmingly does, and the wider public mood on this issue is growing much more insistent. A second vote is the only realistic means of obtaining that outcome. And Labour has to keep its soft Brexit supporters and its anti-Brexit supporters on board. So any Tory-Labour agreement, therefore, has to address the second vote issue in some way. There are many options on this. May\u2019s mantra in her Commons statement today was that it can be raised as an amendment to any wider agreement. But a much stronger commitment would probably be a precondition for any Labour buy-in. Most Labour people want no Brexit rather than a softer one, so a second vote will be a decisive issue when the talks resume. The point to note is that the issue has now reached the top table. May faces a dilemma over timetabling. The Tory party is desperate not to hold European elections on 23 May. It fears derision, desertion and defeat if it has to go through with them. May made her own opposition explicit in her Commons statement. Labour can probably be a bit more sanguine \u2013 the polls look less bad for them. Ministers therefore fear that Labour will spin the process out, so the government is forced to make further concessions. But 23 May could be an opportunity too. Most previous European elections have contained no debate at all about Europe, with the contests seen as an opportunity to kick the governing parties without suffering any penalty. This time could be very different, since there would be an intense argument about Europe, and the parties would face serious questions about their policies. That would be tough for both the Tories and Labour \u2013 and rightly so. Today, the Berlin-based European Council on Foreign Relations published research showing British attitudes towards the European project have become more positive over the past decade. The UK is second only to Finland in feeling increasingly European. The 2016 referendum may have done more for our European consciousness than all the preceding years of neglect. The one big plus of the past five months is that British voters have become much better informed about Europe and have thought more deeply about the issues. Last month\u2019s march and parliamentary petitions showed the effect. So did the quality of those long House of Commons debates. There seems little doubt about the direction in which public opinion is gradually moving. These European elections could reflect it. It is time to be more confident again about Britain\u2019s place in Europe. It\u2019s time to go for it. \u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist",

Two weeks ago, on 29 March, when the UK was supposed to be leaving the EU but article 50 had been extended for two weeks, there were large protests in Parliament Square involving thousands of people furious that their Brexit was not happening. Last night Theresa May accepted another extension, not for two weeks but for almost seven months. And yet in the Commons the Brexiter response was close to subdued.</p> \n  <p>True, <strong>Sir Bill Cash</strong>, the veteran Tory Brexiter, asked May if she would resign, and a few other Brexit hardliners criticised her in strong terms. But there was a lot less bile and rage than we have from them in some previous exchanges, many of the most senior Brexiters were not present or did not speak, and overall May sounded a bit more resilient than she has done of late. It probably had a lot to do with the fact that many MPs are feeling knackered. But the absence of a mighty backlash may also reflect an awareness amongst Brexiters that, although they would love to get rid of the prime minister, at present they don\u2019t have the leverage to do so.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points from the exchanges.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>May urged MPs to use the Easter recess to consider their \u201cnational duty\u201d and reflect on how they might find a solution to the Brexit impasse. </strong>She also claimed it was still possible to pass the withdrawal agreement in time to prevent the UK having to take part in European elections. In <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-european-council-11-april-2019\">her opening statement</a> she said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>So let us use the opportunity of the recess to reflect on the decisions that will have to be made swiftly on our return after Easter. And let us then resolve to find a way through this impasse.</p> \n   <p>So that we can leave the European Union with a deal as soon as possible.</p> \n   <p>So that we can avoid having to hold those European parliamentary elections.</p> \n   <p>And above all, so that we can fulfil the democratic decision of the referendum, deliver Brexit and move our country forward.</p> \n   <p>This is our national duty as elected members of this House \u2013 and nothing today is more pressing or more vital.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>May brushed aside a call from Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter, to resign.</strong> Cash asked May:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Does the prime minister appreciate the anger that her abject surrender last night has generated across the country, having broken promises 100 times not to extend the time? ... Will she resign?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>May said Cash knew the answer to that. She also brushed aside a complaint from <strong>P</strong><strong>eter Bone</strong>, another Tory Brexiter, who asked her whether she still stood by what she told him at PMQs three weeks ago about how she would not consider delaying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> beyond 30 June while she was still PM.

There is some talk around of extending this session beyond two years. Can I say, I think many in this house, including on this bench, would regard that as something that is not acceptable?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>May refused to give Dodds the assurance he wanted, although when Labour\u2019s <strong>Chris Bryant</strong> raised the same issue, she said her focus was on getting her deal through parliament. Even though the DUP are the Tories\u2019 confidence and supply partners, May also responded robustly when the DUP MP <strong>Sammy Wilson</strong> accused her of always giving in to the EU.

Does the Yvette Cooper Bill protect us indefinitely from a No Deal Brexit? (In October, if we're still in an impasse, would May or any PM have to come back to Parliament and be forced to request another extension? If the answer is that we're not protected indefinitely, presumably Cooper and co could re-run this week's exercise. I.e. The fact that there's a majority against No Deal, in both the Commons and the Lords, does give us lasting protection - unless the EU itself eventually chucks us out?).</p>\n     </div> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The Cooper bill was a one-off. After the vote on Tuesday, it ceases to have effect.</p> \n  <p>So it does not rule out a no-deal in October.</p> \n  <p>And it never fully ruled out a no-deal this week either, despite some claims to the contrary. All it did was ensure that the PM would have to hold a vote on extending article 50, making it impossible for Theresa May to go to the EU proposing no-deal on 12 April against the wishes of MPs. There was always a risk the EU could have refused a further extension, despite the Commons vote on Tuesday.</p> \n  <p>But your main point is right. If a majority of MPs now can force a Cooper-style bill onto the statute book against the wishes of the government, it is likely that the same will be true in the autumn (although by then we may have a different Speaker, who may be less indulgent of such procedural initiatives.)</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5caf31f28f08bc7376aeb32d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-11T12:26:51.319Z\">1.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon,</strong> Scotland\u2019s first minister, has written<a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/news/letter-to-the-prime-minister-1/\"> an open letter to Theresa May </a>urging her not to waste the \u201cgift of more time\u201d given to the UK by the EU.

      "bodyText": "Sometimes the most significant event is the one that does not happen. Two weeks ago, on 29 March, when the UK was supposed to be leaving the EU but article 50 had been extended for two weeks, there were large protests in Parliament Square involving thousands of people furious that their Brexit was not happening. Last night Theresa May accepted another extension, not for two weeks but for almost seven months. And yet in the Commons the Brexiter response was close to subdued. True, Sir Bill Cash, the veteran Tory Brexiter, asked May if she would resign, and a few other Brexit hardliners criticised her in strong terms. But there was a lot less bile and rage than we have from them in some previous exchanges, many of the most senior Brexiters were not present or did not speak, and overall May sounded a bit more resilient than she has done of late. It probably had a lot to do with the fact that many MPs are feeling knackered. But the absence of a mighty backlash may also reflect an awareness amongst Brexiters that, although they would love to get rid of the prime minister, at present they don\u2019t have the leverage to do so. Here are the main points from the exchanges. May urged MPs to use the Easter recess to consider their \u201cnational duty\u201d and reflect on how they might find a solution to the Brexit impasse. She also claimed it was still possible to pass the withdrawal agreement in time to prevent the UK having to take part in European elections. In her opening statement she said: So let us use the opportunity of the recess to reflect on the decisions that will have to be made swiftly on our return after Easter. And let us then resolve to find a way through this impasse. So that we can leave the European Union with a deal as soon as possible. So that we can avoid having to hold those European parliamentary elections. And above all, so that we can fulfil the democratic decision of the referendum, deliver Brexit and move our country forward. This is our national duty as elected members of this House \u2013 and nothing today is more pressing or more vital. May brushed aside a call from Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter, to resign. Cash asked May: Does the prime minister appreciate the anger that her abject surrender last night has generated across the country, having broken promises 100 times not to extend the time? ... Will she resign? May said Cash knew the answer to that. She also brushed aside a complaint from Peter Bone, another Tory Brexiter, who asked her whether she still stood by what she told him at PMQs three weeks ago about how she would not consider delaying Brexit beyond 30 June while she was still PM. (See 2.24pm.) She refused to rule out applying for a further article 50 extension in the autumn. (See 3.04pm.) She claimed there was more agreement between Labour and the Conservatives on the customs union than people realised. She said: I think there is actually more agreement in relation to a customs union than is often given credit for when different language is used. We\u2019ve been very clear that we want to obtain the benefits of a customs union - no tariffs, no rules of origin checks and no quotas - while being able to operate our own independent trade policy. The Labour party has said they want a say in trade policy - the question is how we ensure we can provide for this country to be in charge of its trade policy in the future. She risked angering the DUP by refusing to rule out extending this session of parliament until the autumn. The issue was raised by Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, who told May: The current session of parliament is due to end sometime soon. There is some talk around of extending this session beyond two years. Can I say, I think many in this house, including on this bench, would regard that as something that is not acceptable? May refused to give Dodds the assurance he wanted, although when Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant raised the same issue, she said her focus was on getting her deal through parliament. Even though the DUP are the Tories\u2019 confidence and supply partners, May also responded robustly when the DUP MP Sammy Wilson accused her of always giving in to the EU. (See 2.43pm.) That\u2019s all from me for today. And until after Easter, because I will be off. But colleagues will be writing the blog in my place for the next week. Thanks for the comments. Talks with Labour will not continue \u201cfor the sake of it\u201d if both sides cannot agree a deal and party leaders would instead attempt to agree a way to get a parliamentary majority for a Brexit outcome, Downing Street has said. Labour officials are meeting Theresa May\u2019s chief of staff Gavin Barwell this afternoon, which is likely to lead to further talks between ministers and their opposites on Friday. Theresa May\u2019s spokesman said the hope was to agree a deal that meant the UK could leave the EU before June 30, the date the prime minister has previously said she would not to extend beyond. At a lobby briefing, he went on: If we work at pace, the House of Commons can come together, we can agree a deal, ratify it and get out before having to do EU parliamentary elections. There is an opportunity here and we ought not to lose sight of that. We have already started the process with the leader of the opposition and it\u2019s right we see that continue to what we hope will be a successful conclusion. We have stressed the urgency because there is an opportunity to avoid EU elections and to bring a resolution for greater certainty. Bluntly, we will not continue to talk for the sake of it. But we believe the discussion and dialogue we are having is valuable and we want to see that continue while we think we are making progress. We are invested in this and [the PM] told fellow leaders last night ... this is not the usual way of doing things in British politics, it\u2019s much more familiar to some EU leaders in the way that they work but it\u2019s not very typical for the House of Commons. Should that not come to fruition, there would be a way, if we could agree a process with the Labour party\u2019s participation, for the house to express its preference on options and she also made the point that in any event, we will have to introduce and agree and pass the withdrawal agreement bill. A plan has been discussed with Labour, though not agreed, to bring forward the withdrawal agreement bill, which could be a way to attempt to bypass a meaningful vote in parliament and allow MPs to amend the bill as a route to try to achieve a parliamentary majority. Downing Street said it wanted to come to agreement with Labour about how the process for finding parliamentary consensus would work. \u201cWe have tried this twice before and we hope by working with the opposition in a more bipartisan way we can arrive at a series of options that allow us to avoid a situation where the house is asked for its verdict and, bluntly, can\u2019t come up with one,\u201d May\u2019s spokesman said. Number 10 said it would not be a waste of time for MPs to now have a short break from Westminster. \u201cFundamentally, people could use a break,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cEverybody should take a break in a way they feel is most appropriate.\u201d Asked if the PM is planning on taking a holiday, Downing Street hinted that a break could be on the cards. \u201cWe will come back to you with her plans,\u201d her spokesman said. Emmanuel Macron\u2019s tough-guy stance at the EU summit \u2013 refusing the UK a much longer Brexit extension \u2013 was partly down to the French president\u2019s personality, but his reasoning was political, my colleague Angelique Chrisafis explains in an analysis of why Macron acted as he did at last night\u2019s summit. Here article is here. Nicola Sturgeon has written to Theresa May asking her to include the SNP government in ongoing Brexit talks with Labour, as the first minister confirmed that she is now ready to set out her long-awaited plans for a second independence referendum to the Scottish parliament after it returns from Easter recess. In the letter to May, Sturgeon wrote: \u201cWe now have the gift of more time from the EU, and that must be used constructively to re-set the UK government approach. Your ongoing talks with the leader of the opposition should now broaden to include other parties, the devolved administrations, business and civic society, and open up the range of options on the table in an effort to reach a genuine consensus.\u201d Earlier in the day, in an interview with Bauer Radio, Sturgeon said: Obviously we still don\u2019t have clarity about the future of the UK but I\u2019ve always said that when we got to the end of this phase of negotiations I would set out my thinking on where or what that meant for Scotland. Had parliament been recalled today I would have had the opportunity to make a statement in general about the implications of Brexit, so after the recess I will take stock with the Scottish parliament about the implications of last night\u2019s developments ... and what it means for Scotland in the longer term. The way the Easter holidays have fallen mean that Sturgeon will face some pressure of time: Holyrood recess officially ends on April 23rd, and SNP spring conference \u2013 where a heated debate is anticipated around the question of which currency an independent Scotland should use \u2013 is the following weekend. Sturgeon has pledged to set out her plans before parliament in the first instance, but has been under pressure from party activists and some senior parliamentarians who want her to hold a second independence referendum as soon as possible. Charles Walker, a Tory, says May take a few days off. And the chief whip should get some sleep too. May says she thinks it will be good for all MPs to reflect on what happens next away from the chamber. And that\u2019s it. The PM\u2019s statement is over. I will post a summary soon. Rehman Chishti, a Conservative, says taking part in the European elections will give legitimacy to far-right extremists. May says she wants to ensure the UK does not need to participate in those elections. The Conservative MP Derek Thomas asks if it still the plan for the transition period to end in December 2020. May says that the transition can still end at the end of 2020, and that the government will work to ensure it does. Asked if she can be sure that he European parliament will ratify any deal in a timely way, and that it will not hold things up to force the UK to participate in the European elections, May says the European parliament can ratify the deal before Westminster has. May says she is grateful to EU leaders who attended the summit yesterday. Some broke off election campaigning, and one postponed a trip to Vietnam to be there. Labour\u2019s Rupa Huq says she will back May\u2019s deal if it is subject to a confirmatory referendum. That is her compromise. What is May\u2019s? May says constituents want to be able to move on. Having a second referendum would not allow that, she says. Labour\u2019s Seema Malhotra asks who May will include in the forum she plans to set up to consider what happens next with Brexit. May says first she needs to pass her deal. After that, in the second stage of the process, she will engage with businesses, unions and civil society. Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy asks May if she agrees that the best way to consult on what should happen next with Brexit would be to hold a citizens\u2019 assembly. May says she will soon make an announcement on how she will solicit views on what should happen next. Here are some lines from the Number 10 afternoon lobby briefing, from the Times\u2019 Sam Coates, the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope and ITV\u2019s Carl Dinnen. Martin Vickers, a Conservative, asks for an assurance that May will never seek a further article 50 extension. May thanks Vickers for supporting the deal, but she ignores his question. May refuses to rule out applying for a further article 50 extension. Labour\u2019s Mary Creagh says May will not get a stable majority for any Brexit legislation in the Commons unless she includes plans for a people\u2019s vote, which she says is Labour policy passed at conference. Jonathan Djanogly, a Conservative, asks if there is a structure to the talks with Labour. Will MPs know more after the recess? May says, if the UK is to pass a deal in time to stop it needing to take part in the European elections, a timetable will apply. Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant asks May is she plans to keep this session of parliament going until 31 October. May says her focus with parliamentary time at the moment is getting her deal passed. Antoinette Sandbach, a Tory pro-European, says her constituents are pleased to see the government in talks with Labour. She says a survey after the referendum showed only 35% of people who voted leave thought that would mean leaving the single market and the customs union. And she tells May he confidence and supply partners, the DUP, are undermining confidence and not supply the votes. Labour\u2019s Karen Buck asks May when she will decide whether she can bring forward an EU withdrawal agreement bill. May says it will depend how the talks with Labour go. Sammy Wilson, the DUP MP, asks May to name any issues on which the UK said no to the EU. May says she resisted a Northern Ireland-only customs union, and she resisted demands for an exit bill of \u00a3100bn. Alistair Burt, the Tory pro-European, asks May if she will allow free votes in an indicative votes process. May thanks Burt, who resigned recently from the government, for his work as a minister. But she sidesteps his question. Labour\u2019s Owen Smith says May would get her deal through parliament if she attached a people\u2019s vote to it. May says she has already covered this. Chuka Umunna, the former Labour MP who now sits with the Independent Group, says May has put her party before her country. Will May face down Brexiters in her party and consider a people\u2019s vote. May says she has answered this already. Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock asks for an assurance that full membership of the single market through the EEA will be an option in any indicative ballot. May says the UK does not need to be a full member of the single market to gets its benefits. Richard Harrington, the Tory pro-European, asks May if she will use a preferential voting system if she needs to hold indicative ballots. May says she would discuss this with Labour. There are a number of options, she says. But she would want a system that provided a clear result. Labour\u2019s Peter Kyle says MPs seem increasingly fearful of the electorate. Isn\u2019t it time for MPs to investigate how they can use public ballots to bring people through ballots, and how they can lead people with facts? May pays tribute to the way Kyle has championed a confirmatory ballot. But she says no one is running scared of the electorate. Many people would see a second referendum as a sign of bad faith, she says. May says she thinks a second referendum would increase division just at the time when the government needs to bring people together. Labour\u2019s Stephen Doughty says trying to decouple a vote on her deal from a vote on a confirmatory vote will not be acceptable to many Labour MPs. May says she thinks MPs agree they do need to deliver Brexit. Mark Francois, the Tory Brexiter, says \u201cperseverance is a virtue, but sheer obstinacy is not\u201d. What will May do if Corbyn collapses the talks and calls a confidence motion? May says she will continue to argue for the Conservatives to remain in office. UPDATE: This is from the former Labour MP Ian Austin, who now sits as an independent. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, says wasting the new extension on a Tory leadership contest would be \u201can unforgivable act of self-indulgence\u201d. Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden says May has now acknowledged no-deal is unacceptable. But for two years she said that was better than a bad deal. By saying this, she normalised the unacceptable. May says she wants MPs to approve a good deal. Peter Bone, the Tory Brexiter, says May told him at PMQs last month she would not consider delaying Brexit beyond 30 June while she was PM. May says the Commons can honour that commitment by voting for a deal before 30 June. Labour\u2019s Liz Kendall tells May that \u201cone more heave\u201d won\u2019t work. This extension should be used for a purpose. So will she put her deal to a referendum? May says the way to break the deadlock is to pass her deal. Here is some Twitter comment on what Nigel Dodds said about the prospect of this session of parliament being extended. (See 2.07pm.) From Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall Anna Soubry, the former Tory who is now an Independent Group MP, says she welcomes the extension, because it allows more time for a people\u2019s vote. On which issue is May willing to compromise? May says she is talking about this with Labour. Steve Baker, the leading Tory Brexiter, says the government relies on the votes of the DUP. If it pushes through the withdrawal agreement with the backstop, will it rely on Labour votes in confidence motions. May laughs. She says what she is doing with Labour is unprecedented. But she wants to get her deal through, she says. UPDATE: Baker later posted this on Twitter. Labour\u2019s Kate Hoey asks May if she accepts any responsibility for signing up to a backstop that MPs would not support. May says she thinks the backstop is something that should never be used and need never be used. Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper asks May if she is willing to consider a common external tariff with the EU (a key part of a customs union). May says the Commons has rejected a range of options. On a customs union, there is \u201cmore agreement [between the Tories and Labour] than is often given credit for\u201d, she says. She says the language used sometimes obscures this. She says she wants this country to be in charge of its trade policy in the future. May claims Labour and the Tories agree more on a customs union than people realise. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminister, says the EU said they would not offer an article 50 extension without a credible plan as to what the UK would do next, and without stringent conditions. But the EU backed down, and offered an extension without either of those applying. He says May should learn the lesson, and push for changes to the backstop. And he says extending this session of parliament until the autumn would not be acceptable. DUP warns May not to try extending current session of parliament. May says the UK has repeatedly pushed for changes to the backstop. Sir Patrick McLoughlin, the Tory former chief whip, says Jeremy Corbyn refused an offer of cross-party talks some time ago. May says there was not \u201cthe same level of interest\u201d when she first offered cross-party talks to Corbyn. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, asks May to get officials to prepare a timetable for a second referendum. May says the house has already rejected this plan twice. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter, asks May if she understands the anger people feel about this \u201cabject surrender\u201d last night. \u201cWill she resign?\u201d May says she thinks Cash knows the answer to that. She admits that she often said she wanted the UK to leave on 29 March. She voted for that, she says. She also voted to leave on 22 May. But other MPs did not, and so that is why a further extension was necessary. Bill Cash says May should resign. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says Brexit has been a \u201ctotal fiasco\u201d. He says it is an irony the EU has got the UK out of this mess. He asks May if she has offered Labour a second referendum in the cross-party talks. May says she has not offered a second referendum. Her position on this has not changed, and the idea has been rejected twice by MPs. But, she says, as Brexit legislation goes through the Commons, she expects MPs to push for a vote on this. Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, urges May to ignore some of the more vicious attacks on her from their more rightwing colleagues. He asks May if she accepts that the minimum needed for a compromise will be some sort of customs arrangement, and some sort of regulatory alignment. May says the political declaration already says the UK wants to keep the advantages of a customs union. May is responding to Corbyn. She says she is not prepared just to accept Labour\u2019s policy. And Labour is not prepared just to accept hers. This takes compromise on both sides, she says. Jeremy Corbyn is responding now. He says having to ask for a second extension is a sign of the government\u2019s failure. He says a third of May\u2019s MPs voted against her proposed extension earlier this week. He welcomes May\u2019s decision to open talks with Labour. But the invitation did not come at the 11th hour; it came at five past midnight - after the original Brexit deadline, he says. He says the talks have been serious. But if they are to succeed, there will have to be compromise. That is why he was disappointed by Liam Fox\u2019s letter this week. It was an attempt to scupper Labour\u2019s proposal for a customs union. Only yesterday the taoiseach said it was credible and negotiable, he says. He says, if Labour\u2019s Brexit is not possible, all options should be on the table, including a public vote. He says May said she would stand down after a deal is passed. But Labour has no idea who might replace her, he says. He says some of the candidates would scrap the Human Rights Act, rip up \u201cburdensome regulations\u201d, accept no-deal or use Brexit \u201cto create a race to the bottom\u201d. May says some leaders argued for stringent conditions on the UK while it remains an EU member. But, says May, she argued against it. She said there was only one tier of EU membership. She says she told EU leaders that, while the UK remains a member of the EU, it will continue to play a constructive role. That is the sort of country we are, she says. She says she continues to hold talks with Labour. That is not the normal practice in UK politics, but she wants to break the deadlock, she says. She says she hopes to reach a compromise deal with Labour. But, if that is not possible, she will put a small number of options to MPs for indicative votes. She says she will agree to bound by the results, provided Labour agrees to that too. She says the EU has confirmed that it is willing to reconsider the political declaration. She says she knows the whole country is frustrated by this delay. And she understands how this is putting MPs under immense pressure. She urges MPs to use the recess to reflect on this, and consider how they can get out of this impasse. This is their national duty, she says Theresa May is now making a statement about last night\u2019s EU summit. She says she asked for an extension until 30 June. But she says she also asked for an assurance that, if the UK passed the deal before then, it could leave immediately. She says the discussions at the summit were difficult. Many EU countries are frustrated with the impasse, she says. She says many leaders wanted a long extension. The result was a compromise, she says - an extension until 31 October, with a review in June. But the UK could still leave earlier, and it could avoid having to take part in the European elections, she says. Here\u2019s a question from BTL. Does the Yvette Cooper bill rule out a no-deal Brexit for good? The Cooper bill was a one-off. After the vote on Tuesday, it ceases to have effect. So it does not rule out a no-deal in October. And it never fully ruled out a no-deal this week either, despite some claims to the contrary. All it did was ensure that the PM would have to hold a vote on extending article 50, making it impossible for Theresa May to go to the EU proposing no-deal on 12 April against the wishes of MPs. There was always a risk the EU could have refused a further extension, despite the Commons vote on Tuesday. But your main point is right. If a majority of MPs now can force a Cooper-style bill onto the statute book against the wishes of the government, it is likely that the same will be true in the autumn (although by then we may have a different Speaker, who may be less indulgent of such procedural initiatives.) Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has written an open letter to Theresa May urging her not to waste the \u201cgift of more time\u201d given to the UK by the EU. Here\u2019s an extract. We now have the gift of more time from the EU, and that must be used constructively to re-set the UK government approach. Your ongoing talks with the leader of the opposition should now broaden to include other parties, the devolved administrations, business and civic society, and open up the range of options on the table in an effort to reach a genuine consensus. If such talks are to stand any chance of success you must be prepared to recognise in particular that it is essential for Scotland, at the very least, to stay inside the single market and continue to benefit from freedom of movement. Speaking in the Irish parliament, Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy prime minister and foreign minister, said that a no-deal Brexit now looked \u201cless likely\u201d than it did a week ago. He explained: I want to reassure people that if we do face a no-deal Brexit, which looks less likely today than it did last week, we will be ready to support farm families through what will be a difficult period of change and disruption. For an alternative view, see Mujtaba Rahman at 10.49am. On another point of order the Labour MP Chris Bryant has just said in the Commons that there is a rumour that the government intends to keep this session of parliament running until 31 October. Sessions of parliament normally last a year, but after the 2017 general election the government announced that the first session of this parliament would last two years. John Bercow, the Speaker, said he had not been told when the government intends to wrap up this session. In the Commons Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter, has just used a point of order to say the Commons should sit tomorrow to debate the order changing the date of Brexit in the EU Withdrawal Act following the decision last night to extend article 50. He described the decision last night as \u201cabject surrender\u201d, and said not holding a debate was \u201ccowardice and chicanery\u201d. MPs held a debate when the exit date was originally changed from 29 March to 12 April or 22 May. But, as an amendment to the Yvette Cooper bill that was passed on Monday, the government changed the procedure. Previously the date had to be changed under secondary legislation using the affirmative resolution procedure, which meant there had to be a vote first. Now it can be changed under the negative resolution procedure, which means the change goes through unless MPs pass a motion to annul. Speaking at an Institute for Government event this morning, Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the CBI, said that businesses would not be \u201cdancing in the streets\u201d over the Brexit delay until 31 October. She said the new delay would provide \u201cbrief relief\u201d for businesses worried about the \u201ccliff edge\u201d of a no deal. But she went on: It will be quickly followed by frustration, exasperation, we\u2019re still here. Six months will come around extremely quickly and I think members will already be thinking \u2018but that\u2019s the run-up to Christmas\u2019. I\u2019m afraid there will be no dancing in the streets around this and I wouldn\u2019t expect much in the way of ramming down of no-deal planning. Fairbairn also said that the government should use the next fews months to set up a process to find an acceptable Brexit compromise. And that had to involve more than just Labour and the government holding talks, she said. Our huge hope off the back of this six-month reprieve is that it\u2019s used to set up a process and it\u2019s not just people locked in a room on their own which we\u2019ve seen in the last few days. She said there should be a three to four-month initiative bringing together civic society and wider stakeholders to discuss Brexit. It could ask the question \u2018what kind of Brexit do we want?\u2019 We should have done it two years ago, why don\u2019t we do it now? Me personally, I might have liked a slightly longer extension to enable that to happen, but actually this focuses minds. This sounds a bit like Gordon Brown\u2019s proposal for a people\u2019s royal commission to find a version of Brexit acceptable to the country. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, had a meeting in Brussels today with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator. She was accompanied by the Tory Brexiters Owen Paterson and Iain Duncan Smith. Afterwards she said: We wanted to have the unionist voice heard so that he could hear the impact of the backstop and what it will do to the balance in Northern Ireland. We had good engagement around that issue today. Duncan Smith said they had told Barnier about \u201calternative arrangements\u201d to the backstop, and \u201cwhat possibilities there were around the border\u201d Asked if she still had confidence in Theresa May, Foster said: As you know the confidence and supply agreement that we signed was with the Conservative party and whoever the leader of the party is we will work with. We believe in national stability. We want to see Brexit delivered. This is from my colleague Jessica Elgot. During questions in the Commons earlier, Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, said the government was willing to \u201clisten\u201d to requests for a second referendum. The SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry asked him what discussions the cabinet had had about holding a second referendum. Cox said he would not comment on what came up at cabinet, but he went on: What I can say is this; the discussions that are currently going forward, with the Labour Party, with the opposition, are being pursued in good faith, there are no preconditions to it. And of course we will listen to any suggestions that are made, whether it be about a second referendum or any other matter, to see if we can find common ground in the interest of the country to leave the European Union as swiftly as possible. After the Commons business statement there will be a statement on discrimination in football. The prime minister\u2019s statement on Brexit will come after that, which means it begin at some point after 1pm. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has just confirmed that, if MPs a motion on the order paper today, the house will rise for the Easter recess this afternoon and not return until Tuesday 23 April. And she has just announced the business for the first week after Easter, which does not include any Brexit indicative votes, or the introduction of the long-awaited EU withdrawal agreement bill. What should happen next with Brexit? Here is a Guardian Opinion panel, with answers from Simon Jenkins, Sonia Sodha, Stella Creasy and Henry Newman. This is from the Conservative MP Johnny Mercer. Mercer is the backbencher who last year described his own government as a \u201cshitshow\u201d, and so you can understand why he might not be enormously popular with the whips. There is no formal process available to Conservative MPs if they want to remove Theresa May as leader in the immediate future because under party rules a new no confidence vote is not allowed until December. But Francis Elliott, the Times\u2019 political editor, argues that with a new Queen\u2019s speech due in the spring, May does face an existential threat. Here is an extract from his Times article (paywall). The end of the parliamentary session also triggers a review of the Conservative government\u2019s confidence and supply agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party, which was struck after the 2017 snap election in which the Tories lost their overall majority. The deal states that both parties are required to review its \u201caims, principles and implementation\u201d. The break clause was one reason why Mrs May decided to announce that the parliamentary session would last for two years, rather than the usual one year, in June 2017. In the present climate, with the DUP implacably opposed to the Brexit deal as it stands, it is all but impossible to see the party issuing another guarantee to support a government led by Mrs May. The ability to win a Commons vote approving a Queen\u2019s Speech is a necessary condition for a viable government, but without a formal deal with the DUP Mrs May could not be certain it would pass. Mujtaba Rahman, the former European commission official who writes well-regarded Brexit analyis for the Eurasia Group consultancy, thinks that as a result of last night\u2019s EU decison, the chances of a delayed no-deal have increased, \u2018perhaps substantially\u201d. He makes a persuasive argument, in this short Twitter thread. MS are members states. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter and chair of the European Research Group, which is pushing for a harder Brexit, was asked by reporters about the latest Brexit delay as he left home. He told them: I thought the prime minister said a few weeks ago that she wouldn\u2019t agree to any extension and now we are getting quite a long one. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea and it is not delivering on the referendum result. People expected to leave on March 29 and here we are heading towards Halloween. There\u2019s some symbolism in that I think. He also said both main parties were not honouring the promises they made at the last election. We should have left the European Union already and that\u2019s what we need to deliver on. The Conservative party was elected on a mandate of leaving the customs union, leaving the single market, and the prime minister needs to remember the votes that she won in that election, that gave her her mandate. And the Labour party said at the same time it was committed to implementing the result of the referendum, so I think we are in a difficult political situation. But Rees-Mogg also said he was not calling for Theresa May to resign. He explained: I was involved in the vote of no confidence last year and I lost that, so I accept she is the leader of the Conservative party and the prime minister. I am not involved in any leadership efforts to remove her. Here is a sensible question from BTL. There are two main reasons. First, you need to pass legislation for a referendum, but not for a general election. This can take several months, and time needs to be allowed for the Electoral Commission to test the question being asked. Second, under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act (PPERA), there is a minimum 10-week period for the campaign. This allows time for the Electoral Commission to appoint a lead campaign group on either side - not something required in a general election. This paper (pdf), from the Constitution Unit, explains it all in a lot more detail. Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said the EU had fulfilled its fundamental obligation to safeguard the unity of the 27 while also working to build the best possible relationship with the UK after Brexit. S\u00e1nchez said his government had \u201cdone its homework\u201d when it came to preparing for a no-deal Brexit, and renewed his criticism of the Brexit campaign. He said: The most important lesson we need to learn from what\u2019s happening in the UK is that when decision-making processes, based on lies, are put in the hands of the people, societies \u2013 in this case British society \u2013 wind up down a blind alley. We in the EU need to be conscious of the scale of the challenge British society is facing and we need to try to help it reach an agreement. Dates may vary, but the important thing is to give British politics the time it needs to find its way out of a situation that stems from a referendum held three years ago. On Sky\u2019s All Out Politics Maria Caulfield, a Tory Brexiter who reluctantly supported Theresa May\u2019s deal in the last Commons vote, said she did not think May would be able to win over any more Tories. Caulfield said: Talking to colleagues, those who are going to cross over and vote for the deal have done so ... As many MPs that were going to vote for the deal have done so. I think bringing it back for another time I don\u2019t think is going to get us any further. And if we think Labour, with their cross-party talks, have any interest in resolving this matter, we are fooling ourselves. Like David Davis earlier (see 9.01am), she also said the government should try again to get the EU to change the backstop. But the EU has repeatedly ruled this out, and the EU communique issued last night (pdf) explicitly said that the withdrawal agreement would not be reopened. It said: The European council reiterates that there can be no opening of the withdrawal agreement, and that any unilateral commitment, statement or other act should be compatible with the letter and the spirit of the withdrawal agreement and must not hamper its implementation. David Davis, who resigned as Brexit secretary last summer because he opposed Theresa May\u2019s Chequers plan, told the BBC this morning that the pressure on May to resign would \u201cincrease dramatically\u201d following last night\u2019s agreement. He told the BBC: I think what is likely to happen is the pressure for her to go will go up. The pressure on her to go will increase dramatically, I suspect, now. Whether it will come to anything - who knows? Asked if May would still be PM at the time of the party conference in the autumn, he replied: I think it is going to be difficult because by that time we will have had a European election which will become a plebiscite, really, on Brexit. And I suspect you will see a very successful rise of a, sort of, Brexit movement, the Nigel Farage thing, and so on. So, that will be quite difficult. I think it will be very difficult for her. Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has expressed her relief that the UK will not be exiting the EU with no deal, adding that a second referendum on Brexit was now \u201cimperative\u201d. She tweeted: It is a relief that - thanks to the patience of the EU - we will not be crashing out tomorrow. But the UK must not waste this time - allowing people to decide if they still want to leave is now imperative. And Scotland\u2019s interests must be protected. Holyrood\u2019s Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh has meanwhile confirmed that the Scottish parliament will not be recalled this afternoon: he had previously warned MSPs they would be recalled from 1pm on Thursday if the UK was due to leave the EU without a deal on Friday. The SNP\u2019s Europe spokesperson Stephen Gethins MP told BBC Radio Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland that there was \u201cplenty time\u201d to hold a referendum before Hallowe\u2019en, pointing out that when Labour won the general election in 1997 the referendum to establish a Scottish parliament took place 133 days after that, and there are 204 days until the end of October. Later on the same programme, Scottish secretary David Mundell insisted that Theresa May will lead her party into the European elections, adding that the government was open to discussing a customs union with Labour. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. Here is the timetable for the day. 10.10am: Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, takes questions in the Commons. After 11am: Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, makes a business statement in the Commons. After 12pm: Theresa May makes a statement to MPs about the article 50 extension. The former Brexit secretary, David Davis, has called for the withdrawal agreement to be renegotiated and for technical solutions to the Irish border issue to be revisited under a managed no deal. To the incredulity of MPs and commentators Davis insisted that the Malthouse compromise still offered the best solution to the Brexit deadlock. Speaking on Today he said: I think the house is panicky about no deal unnecessarily. The one thing that the House of Commons has voted for, the so-called Brady compromise or the Malthouse compromise. What that means is the deal that the prime minister has put forward but with some modifications so that we don\u2019t have Northern Ireland as it were pushed out of the United Kingdom. That is the one thing that the House has voted for. I don\u2019t quite know why the prime minister has never put it to Brussels. The EU has repeatedly ruled out renegotiating the withdrawal agreement. Davis added: No-deal is not perfect. It will have turbulence in the short term, but actually it is all perfectly manageable. No deal can be done. The Bank of England has got this wrong many many times. Davis also claimed talks with the EU could be reset by Theresa May\u2019s successor. He said: If she does go there will be a new leader then there will be a reset in the negotiations. Any new leader will go over there and say look \u2018this has not worked, we want to start from scratch, particularly on the Northern Ireland issues\u2019. The best outcome one could practically hope for is a return an alternative to the backstop, which allows us to have an invisible border in Northern Ireland. Everybody really knows that there is a technical answer for Northern Ireland. That\u2019s where we should be looking. If we get that sorted out we get out of the Union and on to the next stage of the negotiation. Reaction to the interview has been scathing. Here are three opposition MPs on the interview. And here are three journalists. The UK\u2019s ambassador to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, has written to European Council President Donald Tusk to formally accept the Halloween extension. Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam has the letter. The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, who is one several members of Labour\u2019s front bench sceptical about another referendum, says he now accepts a people\u2019s vote may offer a solution to the Brexit deadlock. Speaking to BBC Breakfast he said: Some sort of people\u2019s vote may be necessary as a way out of this impasse. Now that the deadline has been extended we are trying to see if a compromise can be sorted. If that can\u2019t be done, if the prime minister won\u2019t move on red lines, then yes of course a public vote of some description may be needed as a way out of this mess. Speaking before another day of cross-party Brexit talks with the government Burgon set out where Labour wants Theresa May to compromise. He said: She needs to move on her red line on a permanent customs union. She needs to do more to reassure us about workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections. Crucially ... we need to have some certainty that anything positive that is agreed isn\u2019t going to be ripped up by whoever comes after her, whether it be Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Michael Gove or anyone else. She needs to propose some kind of binding arrangements or some kind of safeguards so that anything positive agreed in these talks isn\u2019t just thrown in the rubbish bin by whoever comes after her. Asked how Labour was prepared to compromise, Burgon said: We are prepared to consider all different options to break this impasse. We voted for a people\u2019s vote in wider circumstances than our strict policy makes provision for, in the votes twice the other week. That shows that we are open minded about this. We are going into these discussions with good faith in the national interest. The Brexit minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, has been put up by the government to put a brave face on the extension. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he insisted the \u201cextension is long enough to get a deal through. Ideally we would like to get the deal through by 22 May.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is not a secret that it is a difficult negotiation.\u201d Kwarteng appeared to accept the UK would have to hold European elections on 23 May. He pointed out that if the UK hadn\u2019t agreed a deal by then it was legally obliged to hold the elections. He added: \u201cDo I want this to happen? No.\u201d Speaking on ITV\u2019s Peston last night, shadow chancellor John McDonnell, said Labour was concerned that agreements it reached with May would not be honoured by a future Conservative leader. One of the key issues for us in the discussions, they are confidential discussions at the moment, but obviously the agenda included for us how do we entrench any agreement that we achieve\u2026 We\u2019ve gone in there positively and constructively, we\u2019ve been in there trying to secure a deal which we think would work. But we\u2019ve always said clearly our big worry is if we can make a deal with Theresa May, what happens when she goes? Jeremy Hunt was asked on Peston whether he would honour any deals Theresa May agrees with Labour in coming weeks to get Brexit through parliament if he were to become prime minister. He replied: The reality is that to get the Brexit deal through, the withdrawal agreement bill has to be ratified in law and it is the contents of that bill that will constitute any cross-party agreements that allows parliament to vote that through, so it\u2019ll be a matter of the law, not a matter of... Peston said: \u201cLaws can change, prime ministers can change laws.\u201d \u201cIf they have a majority in parliament,\u201d said Hunt. \u201cIt may have escaped your attention, Robert, that no-one has a majority in Parliament to change laws.\u201d Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said in a statement businesses will be relieved, \u201cbut their frustration with this seemingly endless political process is palpable\u201d. For most businesses, the \u2018flextension\u2019 agreed by the European Council will be preferable to deadlines that are repeatedly moved forward at the last possible moment. This extension buys Parliament some time to come to a consensus, but they can\u2019t afford to squander it. Politicians must urgently agree on a way forward. It would be a disaster for business confidence and investment if a similar late-night drama is played out yet again in October. Our businesses and our communities need answers to plan for the future, and the government must return its focus to pressing domestic issues, which have been ignored or marginalised for too long. In the event that the Withdrawal Agreement is passed by Parliament, businesses need a clear timetable and fair warning of the UK\u2019s planned exit date, particularly those trading in countries where the UK has not yet finalised much-needed trade continuity agreements. Another excellent reader question. Andrew Sparrow, anticipating you, wrote this answer before he signed off yesterday\u2019s blog in the early hours of the morning: Some of you may be wondering whether, under the terms of the Yvette Cooper bill (the one passed on Monday, against the wishes of the government, requiring the PM to request an article 50 extension) Theresa May has to come back to the Commons and get MPs to agree the new article 50 extension timetable, given that it is different from the one MPs voted to support on Tuesday. The answer is no. The bill, as originally drafted, would have required a second vote in the Commons in these circumstances. But when the bill was in the Lords an amendment passed by Lord Goldsmith, the Labour peer, removed this requirement. Goldsmith argued that it would create uncertainty, because the PM could end up agreeing a new date at the EU summit and then needing to obtain retrospective backing for it in the Commons. Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, has this to say about the agreement reached last night. A \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit remains a possibility, French government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye told French TV station CNews on Thursday. \u201cIt is not impossible that we could again have a no-deal Brexit,\u201d she said. European Union leaders have given Britain six more months to leave the bloc, more than Prime Minister Theresa May says she needs but less than many in the bloc wanted, thanks to fierce resistance from France. However, if May fails to win over MPs on the treaty or fails to hold an election, Britain will leave with no deal on 1 June. Back on the question of whether there\u2019s enough time for a second referendum, this Brexit extension is being seized upon by MPs in favour of a People\u2019s Vote. A confusing contribution from Donald Trump to the Brexit discussions. A question from a reader: Will there will be time to arrange and hold a second referendum? If so what would the timetable be for such an eventuality? That\u2019s a very good question, John, thanks. A referendum on the Brexit deal would take at least six months to organise legally, constitutional experts told our Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u2019Carroll last year, which would mean there is enough time \u2013 just. Lewis Goodall from Sky News, spoke to the Electoral Commission yesterday who confirmed this was the case. Here is the full text of Theresa May\u2019s statement at her press conference in the early hours of this morning. I have just met with Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, where I agreed an extension to the Brexit process to the end of October at the latest. I continue to believe we need to leave the EU, with a deal, as soon as possible. And vitally, the EU have agreed that the extension can be terminated when the withdrawal agreement has been ratified \u2014 which was my key request of my fellow leaders. For example, this means that, if we are able to pass a deal in the first three weeks of May, we will not have to take part in European elections and will officially leave the EU on Saturday, 1st June. During the course of the extension, the European council is clear that the UK will continue to hold full membership rights, as well as its obligations. As I said in the room tonight, there is only a single tier of EU membership, with no conditionality attached beyond existing treaty obligations. Let me conclude by saying this. I know that there is huge frustration from many people that I had to request this extension. The UK should have left the EU by now and I sincerely regret the fact that I have not yet been able to persuade parliament to approve a deal which would allow the UK to leave in a smooth and orderly way. But the choices we now face are stark and the timetable is clear. So we must now press on at pace with our efforts to reach a consensus on a deal that is in the national interest. Tomorrow I will be making a statement to the House of Commons. Further talks will also take place between the government and the opposition to seek a way forward. I do not pretend the next few weeks will be easy or that there is a simple way to break the deadlock in Parliament. But we have a duty as politicians to find a way to fulfil the democratic decision of the Referendum, deliver Brexit and move our country forward. Nothing is more pressing or more vital. The news broke too late to make it onto many of the front pages (though if you see that the news is on the front pages of late editions of other papers, please tweet me!). The deadline did make it onto the late edition of the Guardian. Here\u2019s our front page: And the Metro\u2019s front page deserve a special mention: Here\u2019s how the Mail and Telegraph covered the news online when it broke: Donald Tusk said that the Brexit extension was \u201cas flexible as he expected but also shorter than he expected. This is due to French President Emmanuel Macron who took responsibility for blocking a long Brexit delay and convincing other European Union leaders to agree to a shorter one. \u201cIt\u2019s true that the majority was more in favour of a very long extension. But it was not logical in my view, and above all, it was neither good for us, nor for the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cI take responsibility for this position, I think it\u2019s for the collective good,\u201d the French leader added before leaving the European Council in Brussels. The video of Macron\u2019s comments (in French) is below. Good morning and welcome to the politics live blog, the morning after EU leaders met to debate whether to offer an extension to article 50 to the UK. After marathon six-hour talks, EU leaders offered Theresa May an extension until 31 October, with a \u201creview\u201d to be conducted on 30 June. May did not need to take this deal back to parliament and was able to agree to the deal at the time, which she did. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said: During this time, what happens will be in the hands of the UK. It can ratify the withdrawal agreement, and leave. It can change strategy, although not the withdrawal agreement. Or it can decide to revoke and cancel Brexit altogether. Speaking afterwards, Theresa May repeatedly ducked questions about her future as prime minister, after having previously said she would not accept an extension beyond 30 June. She simply insisted that the UK \u201ccan still leave on May 22 and not hold those European parliamentary elections\u201d if parliament passes the withdrawal deal. May also once again blamed MPs for being the cause of public frustration over the failure to implement Brexit. Asked whether she should apologise for the UK still being in the EU, she said: \u201cOver the last three months I have voted three times to leave the European Union. If sufficient members of parliament had voted with me in January we would already be out of the European Union.\u201d I\u2019ll be keeping this blog ticking over until I hand it to my colleagues, if you have Brexit questions, please get in touch through the comments, via email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com) or on Twitter.

The ship is becalmed. Will the crew return to squabbling? The second postponement of Brexit seems likely to bring out the worst in parliament. Theresa May will be under resumed pressure to resign, which will solve nothing. Remainers and no-dealers will return to their tribes. It is hard to disagree with France\u2019s president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/11/macron-enrages-eu-leaders-after-opposing-long-brexit-extension\" title=\"\">Emmanuel Macron</a>, that a six-month delay beyond June will merely encourage them.</p> <p>The one thing that matters now is votes in the House of Commons. The prime minister has lost her party. If she wants to be true custodian of Brexit, the only requisite votes are sitting opposite her in her talks with Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn. They depend on the UK negotiating to remain in some form of European customs union and/or single market. It might not be ideal, but it is the only deal in sight.</p> <p>May must keep talking to Corbyn. He is the one guarantee to the EU that Britain will stay more or less of one mind over the year ahead. May must come up with something she can put urgently to the commons \u2013 and on a free vote \u2013 to avoid the next deadline of the European elections in May. If in return the commons demands a referendum, so be it. That is a political process, not a deal to put to Brussels.</p> <p>On Brexit, parliament collectively is currently the UK\u2019s only \u201cgovernment\u201d. It must come of age.

With the Easter and summer parliamentary breaks and the suggested minimum time period of 22 weeks to pass an act, and allow the Electoral Commission to stress test it and establish the rules of a new referendum, as well as campaigning, there is no time to waste.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/apr/11/may-to-address-commons-after-eu-sets-october-brexit-deadline-politics-live\">Brexit: May to address Commons after EU sets October deadline \u2013 live news</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Too many of our politicians are currently tiptoeing around Brexit, mainly because they know they can never satisfy all factions in their parties.

But it\u2019s hard to see anything fundamental enough shifting in the next few months that would see a Brexit deal get through parliament.</p> <p>If recent weeks have shown anything, it\u2019s that even the threat of a no-deal cliff edge is not enough to get a majority of MPs rallying behind some sort of deal. EU leaders have been clear there\u2019ll be no reopening of the withdrawal agreement, and so the hard Eurosceptic flank of the Conservatives will hold out for their favoured prospect \u2013 a no-deal Brexit. Equally, we\u2019re highly unlikely to see a Brexit compromise between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn: it would divide both of their parties, perhaps irrevocably.</p> <p>Something big has to change if we\u2019re to avoid ending up in exactly the same predicament in six months\u2019 time. A general election would likely deliver another hung parliament, and it\u2019s hard to see how you even get to one in the first place \u2013 Tory MPs are unlikely to want to risk their own seats by voting for an election or against the government in a no-confidence vote. Hard Brexiters are better off just waiting for the next cliff edge.</p> <p>So the case for a confirmatory referendum on a Brexit deal only gets stronger. The principled case has always been watertight: there was no firm leave proposition on the table when people voted in 2016 \u2013 and now one exists, it\u2019s only democratic that people get a chance to ratify or reject it. But with every week that passes, the pragmatic argument grows in importance: there just isn\u2019t any other way of breaking the gridlock. That\u2019s why we may see even more MPs come round to this in the coming weeks. But they\u2019d better get a move on: holding a referendum would take at least six months, according to the Electoral Commission.</p> <p>\u2022 Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer, and deputy opinion editor at the Guardian</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/stella-creasy\" title=\"\">Stella Creasy</a>: A citizens\u2019 assembly would be a better way of doing politics</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7787bca3e927d38e809ab54e35d71f30a6425ddf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7787bca3e927d38e809ab54e35d71f30a6425ddf/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Stella Creasy\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A long extension will not break the Brexit gridlock \u2013 unless MPs break with the way we make decisions.

      "bodyText": "Simon Jenkins: The only thing that matters now is votes in the House of Commons Suddenly the wind dies. The ship is becalmed. Will the crew return to squabbling? The second postponement of Brexit seems likely to bring out the worst in parliament. Theresa May will be under resumed pressure to resign, which will solve nothing. Remainers and no-dealers will return to their tribes. It is hard to disagree with France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, that a six-month delay beyond June will merely encourage them. The one thing that matters now is votes in the House of Commons. The prime minister has lost her party. If she wants to be true custodian of Brexit, the only requisite votes are sitting opposite her in her talks with Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn. They depend on the UK negotiating to remain in some form of European customs union and/or single market. It might not be ideal, but it is the only deal in sight. May must keep talking to Corbyn. He is the one guarantee to the EU that Britain will stay more or less of one mind over the year ahead. May must come up with something she can put urgently to the commons \u2013 and on a free vote \u2013 to avoid the next deadline of the European elections in May. If in return the commons demands a referendum, so be it. That is a political process, not a deal to put to Brussels. On Brexit, parliament collectively is currently the UK\u2019s only \u201cgovernment\u201d. It must come of age. So far all we see is it sitting with its hands over it ears, screaming. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist Gina Miller: MPs must make the hard decision to revoke article 50 Six months gives us little time to save the country from a calamitous no-deal Brexit. But it is just enough time for the Tories to install an ideologue prime minister who will take Britain so far to the right that it will have even Margaret Thatcher turning in her grave. As exhausted as they may be after so many late-night sittings, our MPs cannot afford to put their feet up. They need to recognise, and quickly, that as things stand they are still facing only two legal options \u2013 revoke article 50 or reconcile themselves to no deal. Those who see a confirmatory vote as the solution do not have time on their side, either. With the Easter and summer parliamentary breaks and the suggested minimum time period of 22 weeks to pass an act, and allow the Electoral Commission to stress test it and establish the rules of a new referendum, as well as campaigning, there is no time to waste. Too many of our politicians are currently tiptoeing around Brexit, mainly because they know they can never satisfy all factions in their parties. They need to recognise that public opinion on Brexit has shifted since the 2016 referendum. Since the start of 2018, 113 out of 125 polls have favoured remaining in the EU. Only three polls have shown a majority wanting to leave. Right-minded MPs have to take on any short-term backlash and pain they may face and make the hard decision to revoke article 50 and reform. We look to them to keep Britain great \u2013 a player on the world stage and not merely an onlooker. \u2022 Gina Miller is a transparency activist and the founder of Lead Not Leave Sonia Sodha: The case for a confirmatory referendum only gets stronger Another cliff edge, another 11th-hour reprieve. Thanks to Emmanuel Macron putting his foot down, it\u2019s a six-month extension we\u2019ve been offered rather than the 12 month one the majority of EU leaders wanted. But it\u2019s hard to see anything fundamental enough shifting in the next few months that would see a Brexit deal get through parliament. If recent weeks have shown anything, it\u2019s that even the threat of a no-deal cliff edge is not enough to get a majority of MPs rallying behind some sort of deal. EU leaders have been clear there\u2019ll be no reopening of the withdrawal agreement, and so the hard Eurosceptic flank of the Conservatives will hold out for their favoured prospect \u2013 a no-deal Brexit. Equally, we\u2019re highly unlikely to see a Brexit compromise between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn: it would divide both of their parties, perhaps irrevocably. Something big has to change if we\u2019re to avoid ending up in exactly the same predicament in six months\u2019 time. A general election would likely deliver another hung parliament, and it\u2019s hard to see how you even get to one in the first place \u2013 Tory MPs are unlikely to want to risk their own seats by voting for an election or against the government in a no-confidence vote. Hard Brexiters are better off just waiting for the next cliff edge. So the case for a confirmatory referendum on a Brexit deal only gets stronger. The principled case has always been watertight: there was no firm leave proposition on the table when people voted in 2016 \u2013 and now one exists, it\u2019s only democratic that people get a chance to ratify or reject it. But with every week that passes, the pragmatic argument grows in importance: there just isn\u2019t any other way of breaking the gridlock. That\u2019s why we may see even more MPs come round to this in the coming weeks. But they\u2019d better get a move on: holding a referendum would take at least six months, according to the Electoral Commission. \u2022 Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer, and deputy opinion editor at the Guardian Stella Creasy: A citizens\u2019 assembly would be a better way of doing politics A long extension will not break the Brexit gridlock \u2013 unless MPs break with the way we make decisions. Instead of using it to talk at each other for longer, we could do worse than spend some time hearing what the public have to say first. Around the world citizens\u2019 assemblies are used to examine the will of the people on issues about which politicians are stuck. It would be 250 members of the public randomly selected from across the UK in the same way a jury is to hear evidence in public on all the options for Brexit. Chaired by an independent person, these panels wouldn\u2019t replace MPs \u2013 parliament could either reject or act on their recommendations. But they would help strip away the party politics and prevarication that has come to define issues such as Brexit. Some \u2013 especially sitting politicians \u2013 react with horror. They claim Westminster is the \u201ccitizens\u2019 assembly\u201d and dismiss them as a mere talking shop. The status quo might be shaking under the Brexit impasse, but there remains a comfort zone. Sticking with what we know means continuing to battle over amendments, whipping arrangements and eyeballing either a second referendum or a general election if all else fails. Others see citizens\u2019 assemblies for what they are \u2013 a better way of doing politics.

The bill, as originally drafted, would have required a second vote in the Commons in these circumstances.

As a result, EU officials are considering extending the mandate of the existing executive led by Jean-Claude Juncker beyond its term which expires at end of October, the senior official said. </p> <p>This extension, which would be limited to a few months, would avoid the risk that a changed power balance in the EU parliament after Brexit could raise doubt about the legitimacy of the new executive, the official said. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cae6b178f0852bbb93b5c0f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-10T22:20:42.476Z\">11.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More on the possibility of October as a new deadline.

Here are the main points he made.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Varadkar said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d that the UK would be offered another extension and that there would not be a no-deal this Friday. </strong>But what he did not know was how long the extension would last, or what conditions would be attached.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of people in the EU were sympathetic to Britain\u2019s plight</strong>. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think the vast majority of people here in the European Union appreciate that the United Kingdom is in a difficult position. It does not want to leave without a deal at the moment, it doesn\u2019t want to vote for the deal and of course a lot of people, maybe even half the population, don\u2019t want to leave at all. So I believe the consensus here in Brussels, and across the European Union, will be to give the United Kingdom a little bit more time for the cross-party talks that are happening to conclude. And we can review the situation then in a few months\u2019 time.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he wanted to see the UK in a customs union with the EU, and that the EU should agree to let the UK have a say when it negotiates trade deals. </strong>He explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One thing I would like to be considered, and I know it is under consideration, is the possibility of a customs union being formed between the United Kingdom and the EU. Ultimately the European Union, we are the biggest trading bloc in the world. We trade more than China. We\u2019ve a bigger population than the US. And, in a world of big blocs, it\u2019s in the interests of the UK to be part of one of those blocs. It is also in our interests to have the UK in our bloc. I think we would be generous negotiating that, understanding that the UK could not be a silent partner in such an arrangement. It would have to have a say in decisions being made.</p> </blockquote> <p>Because of the shared border, Ireland would benefit more than any other EU economy from having the UK in the customs union, and so Varadkar\u2019s support for the idea is not surprising. But this may be the first time he has floated the idea of the UK being able to have a say over EU trade policy as a third country. This is something that the Labour party is also proposing, as part of its customs union plan, but until now it has generally been seen as an unrealistic demand in Brussels.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Varadkar said Britain\u2019s adversarial political system was part of the problem. </strong>He said that he understood Theresa May\u2019s difficulties, because he does not have a majority in parliament either. He went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Perhaps other countries in Europe, including Ireland, have more of a tradition of political parties working together and compromising.

For a second week in a row, Jeremy Corbyn decided to avoid the subject more or less entirely, instead focusing all his questions on council funding and associated areas of poverty and inequality. You can view this in two ways. Brexit-worriers can point, with perfectly good reason, to Theresa May\u2019s trip to Brussels this afternoon where she will politely ask the EU for a short extension to Brexit and wait in a separate room for them to (in all likelihood) refuse this and impose a longer delay under terms of their choosing. It is both something of a national humiliation and by some measure the most immediate political issue of the day. But on the other hand, the Labour leader could argue that poverty is a pressing crisis, and with local elections across much of England and in Northern Ireland just three weeks away, the point must be made. More pragmatically, if you\u2019re still officially in talks with the government on seeking a Brexit consensus, hammering endlessly at May\u2019s failures over this could be seen as uncooperative.</p> <p>What was perhaps more surprising was the relative lack of Brexit questions from disgruntled Conservative MPs, of which there are plenty. A series of backbench Brexiters, including Bob Blackman, Theresa Villiers and Daniel Kawczynski asked instead about local issues. It was largely left to the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford to press May on a possible second referendum. Of course, MPs don\u2019t often get their moment in the spotlight at PMQs, and it\u2019s a good chance to raise a constituency matter. But given the predictions of outright Tory mutiny if a long Brexit delay came to pass, overall this felt unexpected.</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s line of attack was comfortable ground for a Labour leader, but his questions were consistent and coherent, and his final peroration rousing:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The evidence is clear; the Tories have abandoned communities across the country, they\u2019ve left towns and cities to fend for themselves after nine years of vindictive, damaging austerity... This government stands for tax cuts for the richest and swingeing cuts for the rest.Will the prime minister now admit that far from tackling the burning injustices she talked about, her government\u2019s cruel and unfair policies have pushed councils to the brink and left those just about managing not being able to manage at all? That is her legacy.</p> </blockquote> <p>May shot back with a series of (often half-relevant) statistics, but it can be safely chalked up as a Labour win.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-04-10T12:03:59.970Z\">at 1.03pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5cadd6db8f0852bbb93b54d2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-10T11:44:14.737Z\">12.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Labour\u2019s <strong>Richard Burdon</strong> asks about possible factory closures by aerospace firm GKN.

But this afternoon Theresa May will head to Brussels to seek an extension to Brexit. She wants a delay of no more than 30 June. But the EU27, mindful that the PM has nothing meaningfully new to offer them, after cross-party talks with Labour broke up until Thursday, seem <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/09/conditions-for-short-brexit-delay-have-not-been-met-says-berlin\">minded to seek a year</a>.</p> <p>Can May accept this?

Asked about a long delay, one that would involve the UK taking part in European parliament elections, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t want to see a delay for up to a year. But, the key with any delay is we are able to terminate it once we ratify in order that we can then get on and get a deal through parliament, ratify that agreement and leave the EU.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to wrap up the live blog. Here\u2019s what happened overnight: EU leaders agreed to offer the UK an extension on article 50 until 31 October, which Theresa May has accepted. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said that until that deadline what happens will be in the hands of the UK. It can ratify the withdrawal agreement, and leave. It can change strategy, or it can decide to revoke article 50 and cancel Brexit. He says the UK will remain a friend of the EU and ended his press conference with an address to \u201cour British friends\u201d: \u201cPlease, do not waste this time.\u201d There will be a \u201creview\u201d of the situation on 30 June, but Tusk said the point of the review was to inform EU leaders what was happening and was \u201cnot a cliff edge\u201d. French President Emmanuel Macron said he took responsibility for blocking a long Brexit delay and convincing other European Union leaders to agree to a shorter one, saying he did so \u201cfor the collective good\u201d. In a press conference after the agreement was reached, May said \u201cthe choices we now face are stark and the timetable is clear\u201d. She acknowledged the \u201chuge frustration\u201d that the UK had not yet left the EU. May repeatedly ducked questions about her future as prime minister, after having previously said she would not accept an extension beyond June 30. She simply insisted that the UK \u201ccan still leave on May 22 and not hold those European parliamentary elections\u201d if parliament passes the withdrawal deal. The prime minister will now head back to London to give a statement in the House of Commons in the early afternoon on Thursday. Now that the threat of a no-deal exit has gone, parliament has scrapped plans to force parliament to sit on Friday and next week. Thanks for following along, I\u2019ll be back in a few hours with an early Thursday Brexit liveblog as May returns to Britain and prepares to address the Commons. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday he took responsibility for blocking a long Brexit delay and convincing other European Union leaders to agree to a shorter one in order to preserve the functioning of the EU. \u201cIt\u2019s true that the majority was more in favour of a very long extension. But it was not logical in my view, and above all, it was neither good for us, nor for the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cI take responsibility for this position, I think it\u2019s for the collective good,\u201d the French leader added before leaving the European Council in Brussels. For those qui parlent fran\u00e7ais, the video of Macron\u2019s comments is below. Jeremy Hunt has said the Conservative Party would not fare well in an election without Brexit having been delivered. Speaking on ITV\u2019s Peston, he said: \u201cIt would be absolutely catastrophic for us to face the people again in a General Election if we have not delivered Brexit, which was our central promise at the last election.\u201d Hunt was also asked whether he would honour any deals Theresa May agrees with Labour in coming weeks to get Brexit through parliament if he were to become prime minister. \u201cThe reality is that to get the Brexit deal through, the Withdrawal Agreement bill has to be ratified in law and it is the contents of that bill that will constitute any cross party agreements that allows Parliament to vote that through, so it\u2019ll be a matter of the law, not a matter of...\u201d Peston said: \u201cLaws can change, Prime Ministers can change laws.\u201d \u201cIf they have a majority in parliament,\u201d said Hunt. \u201cIt may have escaped your attention, Robert, that no-one has a majority in Parliament to change laws.\u201d Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, said Labour was concerned that agreements it reached with May would not be honoured by a future Conservative leader. \u201cOne of the key issues for us in the discussions, they are confidential discussions at the moment, but obviously the agenda included for us how do we entrench any agreement that we achieve\u2026 We\u2019ve gone in there positively and constructively, we\u2019ve been in there trying to secure a deal which we think would work. But we\u2019ve always said clearly our big worry is if we can make a deal with Theresa May, what happens when she goes? Theresa May repeatedly ducked questions about her future as prime minister, after having previously said she would not accept an extension beyond June 30. She simply insisted that the UK \u201ccan still leave on May 22 and not hold those European parliamentary elections\u201d if parliament passes the withdrawal deal. May also once again blamed MPs for being the cause of public frustration over the failure to implement Brexit. Asked whether she should apologise for the UK still being in the EU, she said: \u201cOver the last three months I have voted three times to leave the European Union. If sufficient members of parliament had voted with me in January we would already be out of the European Union.\u201d The prime minister will now head back to London to give a statement in the House of Commons in the early afternoon on Thursday and it has scrapped plans to force parliament to sit on Friday and next week now the threat of a no deal Brexit has gone in the immediate term. The government will also have to lay a statutory instrument changing the date of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU to October 31. This is Kate Lyons taking over from Andrew Sparrow. First, some reaction from Scotland. The SNP has released a statement urging the government to hold a fresh EU referendum and saying that Scotland has been ignored throughout the Brexit process and saying that the process shows \u201cScotland\u2019s interests are best protected through independence\u201d. Commenting after the Brussels Brexit summit, Stephen Gethins MP said: This is a watershed moment in the Brexit process. With the European Union agreeing to a further extension to Article 50, Theresa May must use this time to hold a fresh EU referendum with the option to Remain on the ballot paper. It is welcome that we will not be crashing out on Friday but Scotland did not vote for Brexit and should not be forced to accept a Brexit deal put together by Labour and the Tories \u2013 parties that have ignored Scotland\u2019s voice and interests every step of the way. Following the outcome of this evening\u2019s EU Summit, the presiding officer of the Scottish parliament has also issued a statement confirming that the Scottish parliament will not be recalled. Rt Hon Ken Macintosh MSP, the presiding officer, said: Following confirmation that the United Kingdom will not be leaving the EU on 12 April, I have taken the decision that Parliament will not be recalled. Members have been made aware and Parliament is scheduled to meet again on 23 April 2019. Here is the full text of Theresa May\u2019s statement at her press conference. I have just met with Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, where I agreed an extension to the Brexit process to the end of October at the latest. I continue to believe we need to leave the EU, with a deal, as soon as possible. And vitally, the EU have agreed that the extension can be terminated when the withdrawal agreement has been ratified \u2014 which was my key request of my fellow leaders. For example, this means that, if we are able to pass a deal in the first three weeks of May, we will not have to take part in European elections and will officially leave the EU on Saturday, 1st June. During the course of the extension, the European council is clear that the UK will continue to hold full membership rights, as well as its obligations. As I said in the room tonight, there is only a single tier of EU membership, with no conditionality attached beyond existing treaty obligations. Let me conclude by saying this. I know that there is huge frustration from many people that I had to request this extension. The UK should have left the EU by now and I sincerely regret the fact that I have not yet been able to persuade parliament to approve a deal which would allow the UK to leave in a smooth and orderly way. But the choices we now face are stark and the timetable is clear. So we must now press on at pace with our efforts to reach a consensus on a deal that is in the national interest. Tomorrow I will be making a statement to the House of Commons. Further talks will also take place between the government and the opposition to seek a way forward. I do not pretend the next few weeks will be easy or that there is a simple way to break the deadlock in Parliament. But we have a duty as politicians to find a way to fulfil the democratic decision of the Referendum, deliver Brexit and move our country forward. Nothing is more pressing or more vital. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kate Lyons is taking over now. Q: Will your party see this deadline as a trick or a treat? May says the UK could have been out by 29 March if MPs had backed her deal. Now they must all work to get a majority in parliament, and to deliver on the referendum, she says. Q: Tusk suggested the UK could get a further extension after October. Can you assure people Brexit will actually happen? May says she is very clear that it must happen. She is working to get a majority in parliament. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Q: Yesterday 177 Tory MPs refused to accept your plan for an extension running until the end of June. Now you have agreed one until the end of October. How can you stay as party leader? May says she wants to get an agreement as soon as possible. Q: We could have left this week. You have promised we would be out by various dates, and now it is October. Don\u2019t you owe the country and apology? May says she has voted for her Brexit deal three times. She will continue to work to get it ratified as soon as possible. Q: Can the 31 October be extended again? And what conditions are attached? May says the UK will continue to abide by its obligations, and by the duty of sincere cooperation. The deadline is now to achieve Brexit by October. Q: You said a few days ago that you would not delay Brexit beyond 30 June. But you have agreed to this. So why should you be the person to preside over this. May says what has been agreed tonight will allow the UK to leave before the end of June. Theresa May says she has agreed her extension. She says she wants the UK to leave the EU as soon as possible. The EU has agreed that, if the withdrawal agreement is passed before the end of October, it will be able to leave. So if it can be passed in the first three weeks of May, the UK will be able to leave on 1 June. She says she will make a statement to MPs tomorrow. And talks with Labour will continue. She says it will not be easy. But MPs have a duty to break the deadlock. Here is the full text of the summit conclusions (pdf). Q: What is the point of the sincere cooperation clause? Tusk says EU leaders want a political declaration that the UK would cooperate seriously. Juncker says this is a reference to treaty obligations. He says there is some talk of the UK being able to block EU decisions. He says they had heard voices to this effect. [He is referring to people like Jacob Rees-Mogg and Mark Francois.] But there is nothing new about this, he says. He says the opportunities for the UK to block decisions \u201care very, very limited\u2019, he says. Juncker says they will have Brexit with a deal. But it would be better to have a deal, and no Brexit, he says. Tusk says at least they have reached an agreement here. That does not happen in the British parliament, he says. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Theresa May is due to hold her own press conference shortly. Q: What is the point of the review in June? Tusk says point of the review in June is to inform EU leaders what is happening. It is not a point of decision. Juncker says in June they will just be taking stock. Tusk says June is not a cliff edge, or a moment to take new decisions. Tusk plays down prospect of the EU ending the extension in June under the review procedure. Q: You said the extension was shorter than you expected. Isn\u2019t it the worst of all words? Not short enough to force the issue, but not long enough to allow real change? Tusk says it is better to have something than nothing. He says six months \u201ccould be enough for a good solution if there is goodwill\u201d and a majority for a solution in the Commons. He says he is generally satisfied. He says the idea of a flexible extension was not so obvious to some EU leaders. He says the intention is to finalise this in October. That is the wish and the hope. But he says he is too old to exclude another scenario. Everything is possible, he says. Tusk does not rule out EU agreeing a further article 50 extension in October. Juncker says a no-deal Brexit would have been a disaster. He says he likes the decision. The end date has been fixed for 31 October. He says he is due to leave his job on 1 November. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, is speaking now. He says the commission is happy with this outcome. He says, although the UK will remain a member, sometimes the EU27 will meet as 27. He says there is precedent for this. He says he originally proposed that the Eurogroup of countries should meet on their own. At the time there was opposition to this, but it made sense. He says there will probably be a European election in the UK. He says people think they only talk about Brexit at the EU. When he reads the British press it is just Brexit, Brexit, Brexit. But the EU has reached an agreement with China this week. But this was not widely reported. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, says the EU has decided to grant the UK a flexible extension until 31 October. During this time, what happens will be in the hands of the UK. It can ratify the withdrawal agreement, and leave. It can change strategy, although not the withdrawal agreement. Or it can decide to revoke. He says the UK will remain a friend of the EU. He says this extension is shorter than he expected, but long enough to allow the UK to find a solution. He ends: Please, do not waste this time. Here are two EU leaders on the article 50 extension decision. From the Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar From Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, the Danish prime minister Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam has more on the legal process that will lead to Brexit being delayed. From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand The main Tusk/Juncker press conference will take place in about 10 minutes. Donald Tusk, the European council president, has posted this on Twitter. This means Theresa May has accepted the offer. Which means quite soon we should get the press conferences ... Speaking on ITV\u2019s Peston earlier this evening, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said he thought that the government/Labour talks intended to establish a Brexit compromise had the potential to produce a deal, but that so far there there were still \u201cfundamental disagreements\u201d between the two sides about the future relationship between the UK and the EU. He said that officials on both sides would be holding talks later on Thursday. And there was a possibility of the politicians meeting again on Friday, he said. Here is some more comment on the 31 October decision. From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall From the Telegraph\u2019s Gordon Rayner From the Times\u2019s Bruno Waterfield Some minor changes are being made to the extension plan, ITV\u2019s Paul Brand and Le Soir\u2019s Jurek Kuczkiewicz report. Emmanuel Macron will not be holding a press conference tonight, Catherine Nicholson from France24 reports. The Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes agrees. This is from Mujtaba Rahman, the former EU official who produces well-regarded Brexit analysis for the Euraasia Group consultancy. Jack Blanchard from Politico Europe has some good news for MPs. By tomorrow afternoon Blanchard means Thursday afternoon. Ministers were planning to ask MPs to sit on Friday, and on Monday and on Tuesday next week. But those plans have now been scrapped, and the Easter recess starts at the end of proceedings later today. Some of you may be wondering whether, under the terms of the Yvette Cooper bill (the one passed on Monday, against the wishes of the government, requiring the PM to request an article 50 extension) Theresa May has to come back to the Commons and get MPs to agree the new article 50 extension timetable, given that it is different from the one MPs voted to support on Tuesday. The answer is no. The bill, as originally drafted, would have required a second vote in the Commons in these circumstances. But when the bill was in the Lords an amendment passed by Lord Goldsmith, the Labour peer, removed this requirement. Goldsmith argued that it would create uncertainty, because the PM could end up agreeing a new date at the EU summit and then needing to obtain retrospective backing for it in the Commons. From the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope: Here is some Twitter comment on the implications of a new 31 October deadline. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg: From my colleague Rowena Mason: From the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes: This is from the Maltese prime minister Joseph Muscat. Here is footage of Theresa May arriving back at the summit HQ to be briefed on what the EU27 have decided to offer. The Telegraph\u2019s Peter Foster has more about how Emmanuel Macron\u2019s intransigence has gone down badly with EU officialdom. According to the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge, some EU officials have not been impressed by Emmanuel Macron\u2019s conduct tonight. Nothing is ever simple in Brexit. As the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg points out, faced with a choice between a short article 50 extension and a long one, the EU has settled for neither \u2013 or something in between. It\u2019s official. This is from Donald Tusk, the president of the European council. From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall EU sources have confirmed that there will be an article 50 extension to 31 October with a review of British cooperation to determine whether there should be an earlier exit on 30 June \u2013 the date Theresa May originally asked for. The June \u201cbreak clause\u201d has been put in to appease France, as the president, Emmanuel Macron, wanted assurances that the UK would conduct European elections properly. Theresa May has arrived back at the summit, HuffPost\u2019s Arj Singh reports. More on the new Brexit deadline. From the BBC\u2019s Katya Adler: From the Sunday Times\u2019 Andrew Byrne: From my colleague Jennifer Rankin: Reuters have just snapped this. EU leaders agreed on Thursday to delay Brexit until the end of October, with a review in June, diplomatic sources told Reuters. European Union officials are considering an extension of the EU commission\u2019s mandate should Britain be granted a long delay to its planned exit date, according to Reuters. The Reuters story goes on: A Brexit delay beyond EU parliament elections scheduled on May 23-26 would force Britain to participate in the vote and elect representatives to the EU assembly - an option May wants to avoid but which could become inevitable if the British parliament fails to ratify a withdrawal deal in coming weeks. British participation could change the political balance in the next European legislature, EU officials fear, as Britons are seen electing strongly Eurosceptic lawmakers, boosting already growing numbers of nationalists who seek to weaken the bloc. Yet Britain\u2019s Labour party, if it fields candidates, could boost the weight of the socialist grouping in the EU assembly, potentially allowing the centre-left to gain a majority. Polls in the remaining 27 EU countries currently predict the centre-right will win most seats in the next EU parliament - so when Britain and its MEPs leave the EU, the majority in the European assembly could change. That raises uncertainty over the next executive commission, which must be approved by European lawmakers. As a result, EU officials are considering extending the mandate of the existing executive led by Jean-Claude Juncker beyond its term which expires at end of October, the senior official said. This extension, which would be limited to a few months, would avoid the risk that a changed power balance in the EU parliament after Brexit could raise doubt about the legitimacy of the new executive, the official said. More on the possibility of October as a new deadline. This is from the Sunday Times\u2019 Andrew Byrne. This is from the FT\u2019s Mehreen Khan. From the Telegraph\u2019s Peter Foster After a short break, at the end of what was effectively the first round of talks in the EU27 meeting, EU leaders are now back in the room for the bit where they have to thrash out their differences. This is from Sky\u2019s Deborah Haynes. From my colleague Jennifer Rankin 23 June 2019 would be the third anniversary of the referendum. John Whittingdale, the Tory Brexiter, also told Peston that the Conservatives would pay a price at the local elections for the \u201chuge anger\u201d that people feel about the fact that Brexit has been delayed. Theresa May may be planning to stay in office until her Brexit deal has passed (see 10.28pm), but John Whittingdale, the Tory Brexiter and former cabinet minister, has just told ITV\u2019s Peston that \u201cmore and more\u201d of his colleague now think it is time for a new leader. From Politico Europe\u2019s Lili Bayer Sophie in \u2019t Veld, a Dutch MEP and deputy to the European parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman, Guy Verhofstadt, told BBC\u2019s Newsnight that MEPs were worried about the UK being a disruptive influence if it gets a long article 50 extension. She said: It cannot be that we will be held hostage by the UK for who knows, months, maybe a few years even. We need to be absolutely sure that the UK is not going to disrupt the work of the European Union. And there is a big question mark of course. Some government leaders have said that we can just have a code of conduct and ask the UK to not disrupt the European Union. And then the question is, how reliable would a pledge be from the United Kingdom that they are not going to do that? Because legally speaking, as long as the UK is a member you have full voting rights and there is absolutely no guarantee. Tweets by people like Jacob Rees-Mogg for example [see 10.35pm], that if we stay in the European Union that we disrupt things, it doesn\u2019t create an atmosphere of trust here. From the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge This is from the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming. These are from the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar. This is from Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter, responding to a New York Times article about the German Europe minister, Michael Roth, criticising Rees-Mogg for saying the UK would be disruptive if forced to stay in the EU. Theresa May is now having dinner with her team in a discreet location away from the Justus Lipsius building where the 27 are arguing over the length of the article 50 extension while eating warm scallop salad, cod with shrimps and an iced macademia nut parfait. One consequence of any decision to grant a longer delay to Brexit is likely to be that she attempts to cling on as leader for even longer. Some Tory MPs, such as Peter Bone, have questioned if she should now stand down after saying she would not \u201cas prime minister\u201d entertain a delay longer than June 30. (See 4.02pm.) But Tory sources are clear that she has abandoned her position that she could not support a long delay, saying she would accept an extension as long as it has a break clause if her withdrawal deal passes. In contrast, May has not dropped her pledge to stay on for as long as the first phase of EU negotiations last and carry on attempting to pass her withdrawal agreement for as long as it takes. In practice, this could be nine months or a year if the EU grant a lengthy extension. This is what a senior Tory source says: When she made the announcement at the 1922 [Committee] and in front of parliament that she was prepared to stand down as prime minister once we had completed phase one of the negotiations and for there to be a new leadership in place for phase two, effectively that is the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. That remains the case. She understands that the Conservative party feels a sense that new leadership is required for the second phase of negotiations. That was the commitment she gave to her parliamentary colleagues and that\u2019s one she stands by. Conservative MPs may try take matters out of her hands and attempt to force her out. But their hands are somewhat tied by the rules of the 1922 Committee that mean she cannot face a challenge within 12 months of the previous one - in December last year. And while we\u2019re on the subject of comments BTL, thank you to everyone who has provided an answer to my query about \u201cBrexit-Krimi-Nacht\u201d. (See 9.37pm.) Here is a selection of the responses - all giving substantially the same answer, but with some readers picking up slightly different nuances from what is implied. It sounds like a German version of the joke about tonight being the season finale of the Brexit box set. I don\u2019t know if this was intentional, but Theresa May and Angela Merkel are both fans of lowbrow detective drama. Merkel likes Midsomers Murders. (David Cameron apparently arranged to watch one when Merkel visited Chequers, as part of his doomed attempt to butter her up.) And May likes NCIS - another extremely undemanding crime drama. The plot twists in Brexit are infinitely more thrilling ... I am afraid we are going to have to close the comments at 10.30pm. I am sorry about that, but our comments need to be moderated, we have not got an infinite supply of moderators, and the ones that we do have, who are all excellent, do sometimes like to go home. From my colleague Jennifer Rankin These are from the Irish Times\u2019 Pat Leahy. Florian Eder at Politico Europe says this tweet, from a German journalist, matches what we have been told about picture on Angela Merkel\u2019s iPad that caused her and Theresa May some amusement. (See 6.22pm.) Twitter translates this as \u201c#May And #Merkel at the same time in London and Berlin before they go through a Brexit crime night together again in Brussels.\u201d I\u2019m afraid the \u201cBrexit-Krimi-Nacht\u201d reference is a bit beyond me. If someone can explain BTL, please do ... From my colleague Jennifer Rankin These are from the Telegraph\u2019s James Rothwell and the Express\u2019s Joe Barnes. From my colleague Jennifer Rankin From the AFP\u2019s Damon Wake And this is from my colleague Daniel Boffey. These are from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby and the Telegraph\u2019s James Rothwell, who have more on Emmanuel Macron pushing for a short extension. These are from the Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp. Jeremy Corbyn has welcomed what Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, said earlier about wanting the UK to have a say over EU trade policy if it stays in the customs union. (See 5.26pm.) Corbyn says this vindicates Labour\u2019s position - which it would do, if other EU leaders agreed. As this Telegraph story suggests, that is not a given. This is from Bloomberg\u2019s Nikos Chrysoloras. From the Sunday Times\u2019 Andrew Byrne The BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming has the summit menu. This is from RTE\u2019s Paul Cunningham. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, is due to meet Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, in Brussels tomorrow. She will be accompanied by the DUP MEP Diane Dodds and the Tory Brexiters Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson. In a statement issued ahead of the meeting, Foster restated her opposition to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit policy. She said: The European Union has spoken much about protecting the peace process and the Belfast agreement but has consistently ignored the views of unionists who do not want a new border erected between Northern Ireland the rest of the United Kingdom. Despite the prime minister being warned about the opposition to her withdrawal agreement, she has limped along and tried to force people into a cul-de-sac where they have no option but to support her deal. That is a weak approach and demeans the strength of this great nation. It is also foolish as it traps the UK and burdens future generations with a bad deal. Our great democratic principles have been damaged. It is outrageous that almost three years after people voted to leave the European Union, we are potentially facing another European election in the United Kingdom. This is from AFP\u2019s Dave Clark. This is from the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar. \u201cBetter than last time\u201d is not an especially high bar. At the last EU summit, after hearing Theresa May\u2019s pitch, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, told his colleagues (once she was out of the room) that he had revised down his estimate of her chances of getting her deal through parliament from 10% to 5%. This is from my colleague Daniel Boffey. The EU27 have now dismissed Theresa May from the room and they are now engaged in the debate at the centre of this summit - how to respond to Theresa May\u2019s request for an article 50 extension. We have not heard any detailed account of what May said to the EU27 when she made the case for a Brexit delay until 30 June (her preference), and we do not know what is being said in the room. But some things have emerged from the interviews given by leaders as they arrived at the summit. This is what we know. The EU27 have a genuine choice to make about how long the extension should be, and there is no consensus. At some EU summits the conclusions are pre-cooked, but tonight there seem to be a wide range of views around the table. In his letter to leaders sent yesterday, Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, proposed a longer extension than the one requested by May and said: \u201cOne possibility would be a flexible extension, which would last only as long as necessary and no longer than one year.\u201d In a draft of the summit conclusions leaked yesterday the end date is given as XX.XX.XXXX. Andrej Babis, the Czech prime minister, told reporters as he arrived that a year-long extension would be \u201cfine\u201d. Mateusz Morawiecki, his Polish counterpart, said he supported possibly a \u201clong extension\u201d because of the dangers of a no-deal Brexit. And Giuseppe Conte, the Italian PM, said \u201cobviously\u201d the extension would have to last more than a couple of months. But Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor, said he and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, favoured a short extension. And Marjan Sarec, the Slovenian prime minister, told Politico Europe, which is running a very good summit live blog, that an extension until December would be \u201ca little bit long\u201d. As my colleague Daniel Boffey reports (see 7.45pm), a key division is between Macron and Angela Merkel, the two most powerful leaders in the EU27, who are at loggerheads over this issue. There seems to be no real risk of anyone vetoing an article 50 extension. Macron said that \u201cnothing was guaranteed\u201d as he arrived, but he did not seem to be seriously preparing the ground for doing a de Gaulle (de Gaulle engineered his own version of no-deal, when he twice vetoed the UK joining the EEC) and no leader interviewed on the way in seemed to think there was any real prospect of the UK being forced out on Friday. EU leaders were supportive of Tusk proposal, in his letter yesterday, for a longer extension to be accompanied by conditions on the UK. For the record, Tusk said: Some of you have raised concerns that the UK\u2019s continued presence as a departing EU country would pose risks for the functioning of the EU27 at a time of key decisions on its future. To address them we would need to agree on a number of conditions: no re-opening of the withdrawal agreement; no start of the negotiations on the future, except for the political declaration; the UK would have to maintain its sincere cooperation also during this crucial period, in a manner that reflects its situation as a departing member state. These conditions are reflected in the draft summit conclusions leaked yesterday. May seems resigned to not being offered the extension until 30 June that she is requesting. But she downplayed the embarrassment of this likely snub by stressing, as she arrived, that her priority was to get the \u201cflexible extension\u201d proposed by Tusk that would allow the UK to leave as soon as the withdrawal agreement is passed. She still seems to think that the UK will be able to use this option to leave before 22 May (which would enable the government to cancel the European elections in the UK). May is sidestepping questions about whether she would resign if the UK ended up remaining in the EU beyond 30 June. (See 3.45pm.) This is an issue for her because she told MPs recently that as prime minister she was not willing to delay Brexit beyond 30 June. (See 4.02pm.) She did tell MPs recently that she was not planning to remain in office for the next stage of the Brexit talks, but that offer to quit was predicated on the basis that MPs would pass her deal, which they have not, and now it is not clear at all how long she will seek to stay in Number 10. On Radio 5 Live earlier today David Gauke, the justice secretary, said he thought May could stay as prime minister for another year. He explained: She has said that if we can get through phase one and that we leave the EU, she has made it clear that she will then leave as leader of the Conservative party and the PM, and be replaced by someone who would then negotiate phase two. If we can\u2019t get phase one dealt with, then if we are still in middle of negotiations, if there is still considerable uncertainty, then ... it may well be the case that the last thing we need as a country is a leadership election at that point, and the right thing would be for Theresa as prime minister to continue to get this process done. Antonio Tajani, the president of the European parliament, has dismissed the idea that it would be acceptable for the UK to elect MEPs (if it is still a member of the EU on 23 May) but for them to not take up their seats (if the UK leaves before the end of June, before the new parliament has met). (See 6.37pm.) This is problematic because May does seem to believe that this is an option. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, has said that he would like the UK to stay in a customs union with the EU and that, in those circumstances, it should be given a role in deciding EU trade policy. (See 5.26pm.) Here are the EU leaders around the summit table. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp. France and Germany are understood to be at loggerheads over both the length of the extension and the conditions that the EU should put on a delay to Brexit. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is arguing that a short extension to 30 June is unlikely to provide enough time for the impasse in Westminster to be broken, and Berlin is seeking an extension until 31 December. Germany believes that the biggest incentive for Conservative MPs to back the Brexit deal is the threat of holding European elections. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, meanwhile, is understood to looking at a very short extension, possibly up until immediately before the European elections, sources have said. There could be a further extension if the UK signs up to stringent conditions, Macron has said. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg has the iPad scoop. (See 6.22pm.) Theresa May has now finished making her pitch to her fellow EU leaders. Now she is out of the room, and the EU27 are deciding what to do next. This is the key meeting of the evening. This is from BuzzFeed\u2019s Europe editor, Alberto Nardelli. At his press conference Antonio Tajani, the president of the European parliament, made it clear that he was not happy about the idea of the UK electing MEPs on 23 May, only for them to not take their seats in the parliament if Brexit took place before 30 June. Theresa May seems to think this would be possible, but Tajani said he disagreed. These are from the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge. UPDATE: Tajani then posted this on Twitter. Here is the iPad clip. (See 6.22pm.) Here is footage of the EU leaders milling around at the start of the meeting. The highlight came when Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, showed Theresa May something on her iPad. May responded with a burst of laughter. Sadly, the EU does not provide audio with this footage, so we don\u2019t know what the joke was. Here is Theresa May sitting alongside Donald Tusk at the European council meeting. Antonio Tajani, the president of the European parliament, is now holding a press briefing after his session with the EU leaders. (See 5.37pm.) He says he has eight points. First, it is important to end the uncertainty around Brexit, he says. Second, he said a no-deal Brexit could be avoided at all costs. Third, he says the parliament wants to see an agreement between the government and the opposition in London as soon as possible. Fourth, he says he wants greater clarity about the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU. Fifth, he says the parliament wants more clarity about what is being negotiated in London, and it wants to know if there will be a clear majority of a way ahead. Sixth, he says the parliament wants to know the UK will do if no agreement is reached. Will there be a referendum or a general election, or will article 50 be revoked? Seventh, he says an extension must not be allowed to reopen the withdrawal agreement. Eighth, he says if the UK remains in the EU beyond the European elections, it must take part in those election. But the elections should not be viewed as a game, he says. He says these are the points he made when he addressed EU leaders earlier. He says, asked what would happen to British MEPs after Brexit, he said they would not be able to stay in the parliament. The session with the president of the European parliament, Antonio Tajani, is over. Now the European council is starting its session with Theresa May, who will formally make her request for an article 50 extension lasting until 30 June. She set out her case in the letter she sent to Donald Tusk, the council president, last week. Here is the Guardian\u2019s story from the opening of the summit. Here is a clip of Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, speaking to the media when he arrived earlier. He said any article 50 extension would have to be \u201cuseful\u201d and \u201cserve a purpose\u201d. Any extension has to be useful and serve a purpose. Our common purpose is to get the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. This withdrawal agreement is the only was to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK which is our common purpose. This is from Preben Aamann, Donald Tusk\u2019s spokesman. EU leaders have just started the first item on the summit agenda - a meeting with Antonio Tajani, president of the European parliament. Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg, proposed \u201can intelligent extension\u201d as he arrived at the summit. Asked what length extension he favoured, he said: I would support an intelligent extension. If it\u2019s long or short, the main point for me is that we have European elections. You can\u2019t be a member and have no elections ... If there is a longer extension, there is no lunch for free. So we need to know why, the reason they need a longer extension. He also said that he hoped Brexit would be a \u201cfriendly divorce\u201d. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, was more reflective than most of the other EU leaders when he spoke to reporters on the way in. Here are the main points he made. Varadkar said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d that the UK would be offered another extension and that there would not be a no-deal this Friday. But what he did not know was how long the extension would last, or what conditions would be attached. He said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of people in the EU were sympathetic to Britain\u2019s plight. He said: I think the vast majority of people here in the European Union appreciate that the United Kingdom is in a difficult position. It does not want to leave without a deal at the moment, it doesn\u2019t want to vote for the deal and of course a lot of people, maybe even half the population, don\u2019t want to leave at all. So I believe the consensus here in Brussels, and across the European Union, will be to give the United Kingdom a little bit more time for the cross-party talks that are happening to conclude. And we can review the situation then in a few months\u2019 time. He said he wanted to see the UK in a customs union with the EU, and that the EU should agree to let the UK have a say when it negotiates trade deals. He explained: One thing I would like to be considered, and I know it is under consideration, is the possibility of a customs union being formed between the United Kingdom and the EU. Ultimately the European Union, we are the biggest trading bloc in the world. We trade more than China. We\u2019ve a bigger population than the US. And, in a world of big blocs, it\u2019s in the interests of the UK to be part of one of those blocs. It is also in our interests to have the UK in our bloc. I think we would be generous negotiating that, understanding that the UK could not be a silent partner in such an arrangement. It would have to have a say in decisions being made. Because of the shared border, Ireland would benefit more than any other EU economy from having the UK in the customs union, and so Varadkar\u2019s support for the idea is not surprising. But this may be the first time he has floated the idea of the UK being able to have a say over EU trade policy as a third country. This is something that the Labour party is also proposing, as part of its customs union plan, but until now it has generally been seen as an unrealistic demand in Brussels. Varadkar said Britain\u2019s adversarial political system was part of the problem. He said that he understood Theresa May\u2019s difficulties, because he does not have a majority in parliament either. He went on: Perhaps other countries in Europe, including Ireland, have more of a tradition of political parties working together and compromising. The British approach to politics is much more adversarial. I\u2019m not sure, on balance, that\u2019s actually in the UK\u2019s longterm interests. Here are some extracts from what Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said as she arrived at the summit. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, lived up to his reputation as the most Anglo-sceptic of the EU\u2019s leaders (at least in the context of Brexit) in his remarks to journalists as he arrived. Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161, the Latvian prime minister, told reporters that it was up to the British to decide what they wanted as he arrived at the summit. If the Brits are asking for a little more time to decide, it\u2019s really up to the British parliament, the British government, the British people to decide. It seems that there are really three choices: a no-deal Brexit, that\u2019s always an option if the Brits were to decide that; a withdrawal with an agreement is an option because it has been negotiated; and I guess there\u2019s a third possibility, of revoking article 50, if the Brits were to decide. So it\u2019s up to the Brits to decide. Today we will be speaking about it but it\u2019s not our decision. We already have an offer on the table in terms of the withdrawal agreement. It\u2019s up for the Brits to decide what it is that they want. If they need a little more time, I think it\u2019s reasonable to discuss what that would be. When it was put to him that EU leaders would decide the fate of the UK this evening, Kari\u0146\u0161 rejected that. It would be up to Britain to decide its future, he said. From the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope Dalia Grybauskait\u0117, the Lithuanian president, told reporters that it was \u201chighly probable\u201d that the extension offered to the UK would be longer than the one until 30 June requested by Theresa May, the BBC\u2019s Gavin Lee reports. Stefan Lofven, the Swedish prime minister, told journalists there was \u201ca lot of frustration\u201d about Brexit as he arrived at the summit, Sky\u2019s Greg Heffer reports. The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babis, spoke to reporters as he arrived at the summit. He said he hoped that EU leaders would have a \u201cshort discussion\u201d this time and that the meeting would not go on for eight hours, as it did last time the European council was discussing an article 50 extension. He also said he expected the UK to \u201cget much more time than expected\u201d. Speaking ahead of today\u2019s summit, the French government stressed that another article 50 extension was not automatic. As Reuters reports, Sibeth Ndiaye, a government spokeswoman, said the issued had been discussed at the weekly cabinet meeting at the Elysee palace, before Emmanuel Macron, the president, left for the summit. \u201cThe no-deal option is obviously the one we would least want ... there\u2019s actually a risk and France is prepared\u201d, she said. Ndiaye said that France was open to granting an extension to the Brexit deadline but \u201cthis is not automatic.\u201d France wanted a \u201cclear and credible prospect\u201d from Britain and commitments not to endanger the EU institutions, she said. She refused to say what sort of extension France considered acceptable. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, normally addresses the German parliament before an EU summit. This morning she told German parliamentarians that the UK should be given \u201ca reasonable amount of time\u201d to leave the EU. She said: I am, and the government is, of the view that we should give the two parties a reasonable amount of time. We will deliberate over what kind of extension we want to grant Britain. It could well be that it is a longer extension than has been requested by the British prime minister. But we will organise this extension such that when Britain has passed the withdrawal agreement, Britain can very quickly thereafter execute the exit in an orderly fashion. So, in summary, the government is still very interested in an orderly exit of Britain from the European Union. This is what Theresa May said as she arrived at the summit. She said: The purpose of this summit is to agree an extension, which gives us more time to agree a deal to enable us to leave the EU in that smooth and orderly way. What matters, I think, is I have asked for an extension to June 30 but what is important is that any extension enables us to leave at the point at which we ratify a withdrawal agreement. So we could leave on May 22 and start to build our brighter future. She was twice asked by the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg what she would do if the EU insisted on a longer extension, given what she has said about not being willing to delay Brexit beyond 30 June as PM. (See 4.02pm.) Both times May refused to answer the question directly, instead insisting that she was requesting an extension until 30 June and that she was working to ensure that the UK could leave as soon as possible in a smooth and orderly way. Theresa May was asked if she would remain as prime minister if the UK stayed in the EU beyond 30 June because three weeks ago she said that would be unacceptable. This is what she said at PMQs on 20 March, talking about her first request for an article 50 extension. She said: The government intend to bring forward proposals for a third meaningful vote. If that vote is passed, the extension will give the house time to consider the withdrawal agreement bill. If not, the house will have to decide how to proceed. But as prime minister\u2014 as prime minister, I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than 30 June. And here is the video. Theresa May is speaking to reporters now. Q: Are you embarrassed to be asking for another delay? May says she knows many peope will be \u201cfrustrated\u201d that this summit is taking place. She says parliament has not approved a deal. But she is talking to the opposition to try to find a solution. She says she has asked for an extension until 30 June. But the key point is that the UK must be able to leave when it has passed that deal. Q: You said you would not stay as PM beyond 30 June if the UK were still in. May says she hopes to get the deal through parliament, so that the UK can leave before 22 May (which would mean the UK would not have to go ahead with the European elections). Q: But what will you do if the UK has to stay in? May says she is working to ensure the UK can leave as soon as possible. May refuses to say whether she will resign as PM if the UK stays in the EU beyond 30 June. Theresa May is arriving at the summit now. EU leaders are starting to arrive at the summit. You can watch a live feed of the arrivals on the EU website here. Good afternoon. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Peter Walker. I\u2019ll be here to cover the EU summit - however late it goes. In Brussels Theresa May will be arriving shortly, according to the BBC. Update: it\u2019s now being reported that Roger Scruton has been sacked. A series of Conservative MPs and others have joined Labour\u2019s call for Roger Scruton to be sacked as chair of a housing commission over comments about George Soros, Muslims and Chinese people. After Theresa May failed to give him a clear answer at PMQs on whether she had offered a second referendum at any point during Brexit talks with Labour, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader Ian Blackford has called on Jeremy Corbyn to \u201ccome clean\u201d about what is being discussed: If it is the case that the UK government has not discussed a second EU referendum in their talks with the Labour party \u2013 then it begs the question, what is Jeremy Corbyn up to? The leader of the opposition has been flaky at least on the question of a second EU referendum \u2013 he needs to come clean with the public on what exactly he is bargaining with the Tories, behind closed doors. People deserve to know the truth. Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon earlier repeated the SNP charge that Scotland has been sidelined by the Brexit process, tweeting: Tonight, 12 of the 27 EU member states that will decide the UK\u2019s future have populations smaller than or similar in size to Scotland\u2019s. If we become independent we get to sit at that table - enjoying the same solidarity shown to Ireland - instead of being sidelined by Westminster. At PMQs, May\u2019s riposte to Blackford was quite the opposite \u2013 that Scottish independence would have meant taking Scotland out of the EU. But this is at odds with the EU\u2019s Guy Verhofstadt, who has previously stated before a Commons committee that it was a \u201csimple fact\u201d that Scotland could join the EU without the UK. Reuters has some new Brexit-related quotes from the Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, and it\u2019s probably fair to say they\u2019re on the more gnomic side of things. Asked about a Brexit extension for the UK he said: It is not certain there will be a delay. And it is not certain what that would mean. In the Commons now the government is answering an urgent question from Labour on the second phase of the controversial trials of compulsory ID for voters, which will take place at the local elections on 2 May. At last year\u2019s local polls five councils tested such schemes \u2013 this year it will be ten. The idea is criticised by Labour and others for two main reasons. Firstly, the point to the concerns of charities and campaign groups representing people who are older, have disabilities, or from other vulnerable groups, noting that these people are less likely to have the ID and are so more likely to be disenfranchised. Critics also note that while compulsory ID is meant to combat what is legally called \u201cvoter personation\u201d \u2013 pretending to be someone else to claim their vote \u2013 this is in fact a tiny issue. Cat Smith, Labour\u2019s shadow minister for voter engagement, told MPs that of 266 cases of electoral fraud reported to police last year, the majority concerned campaign officials, and just eight were of alleged voter personation. \u201cThere is actually no evidence of widespread voter personation in the UK,\u201d she said. For the government, the not-to-be-confused-with-Cat-Smith Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith said simply giving one\u2019s name at a polling station was \u201can identity check from the 19th century\u201d, and that last year\u2019s trial showed no reduction in turnout. Last last year Labour urged the government to sack the philosopher Roger Scruton as chair of a housing commission over comments about the Hungarian philanthropist George Soros which the party said veered into antisemitism. Those calls have been repeated after, in an interview with the New Statesman, Scruton spoke again about a supposed \u201cSoros empire\u201d in Hungary, and defended the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, over allegations of antisemitism. Scruton said: The Hungarians were extremely alarmed by the sudden invasion of huge tribes of Muslims from the Middle East. Scruton also argued that Islamophobia is a propaganda word \u201cinvented by the Muslim Brotherhood in order to stop discussion of a major issue\u201d. He also had this to say about China: They\u2019re creating robots out of their own people\u2026 each Chinese person is a kind of replica of the next one and that is a very frightening thing. Dawn Butler, Labour\u2019s shadow women and equalities secretary, said Scruton\u2019s comments \u201cinvoke the language of white supremacists\u201d, and May should sack him. Butler said: If she doesn\u2019t, it will be further evidence that she is turning a blind eye to the deep-rooted prejudices and racist views in the Conservative Party, and will again signal that her government endorses these disgusting views. PMQs - Snap verdict: The ongoing (if stalled) Brexit talks between the government and Labour have left UK politics in something of a limbo, as shown by PMQs. For a second week in a row, Jeremy Corbyn decided to avoid the subject more or less entirely, instead focusing all his questions on council funding and associated areas of poverty and inequality. You can view this in two ways. Brexit-worriers can point, with perfectly good reason, to Theresa May\u2019s trip to Brussels this afternoon where she will politely ask the EU for a short extension to Brexit and wait in a separate room for them to (in all likelihood) refuse this and impose a longer delay under terms of their choosing. It is both something of a national humiliation and by some measure the most immediate political issue of the day. But on the other hand, the Labour leader could argue that poverty is a pressing crisis, and with local elections across much of England and in Northern Ireland just three weeks away, the point must be made. More pragmatically, if you\u2019re still officially in talks with the government on seeking a Brexit consensus, hammering endlessly at May\u2019s failures over this could be seen as uncooperative. What was perhaps more surprising was the relative lack of Brexit questions from disgruntled Conservative MPs, of which there are plenty. A series of backbench Brexiters, including Bob Blackman, Theresa Villiers and Daniel Kawczynski asked instead about local issues. It was largely left to the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford to press May on a possible second referendum. Of course, MPs don\u2019t often get their moment in the spotlight at PMQs, and it\u2019s a good chance to raise a constituency matter. But given the predictions of outright Tory mutiny if a long Brexit delay came to pass, overall this felt unexpected. Corbyn\u2019s line of attack was comfortable ground for a Labour leader, but his questions were consistent and coherent, and his final peroration rousing: The evidence is clear; the Tories have abandoned communities across the country, they\u2019ve left towns and cities to fend for themselves after nine years of vindictive, damaging austerity... This government stands for tax cuts for the richest and swingeing cuts for the rest.Will the prime minister now admit that far from tackling the burning injustices she talked about, her government\u2019s cruel and unfair policies have pushed councils to the brink and left those just about managing not being able to manage at all? That is her legacy. May shot back with a series of (often half-relevant) statistics, but it can be safely chalked up as a Labour win. Labour\u2019s Richard Burdon asks about possible factory closures by aerospace firm GKN. May says she will look into it. And that\u2019s it. PMQs is over. The Green MP Caroline Lucas says young Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg is visiting parliament next week, and asks if May will meet her. She does not answer this in her response. Next is a question on fishing and Brexit from Tory David Duguid, and one on universal credit from the SNP\u2019s Drew Hendry. After that, Tory Neil O\u2019Brien asks about access to another drug, one to treat spinal muscular atrophy. Labour\u2019s Wayne David asks about what he says is falling police funding, which May rejects. Then Tory MP Shailesh Vara and May agree with each other on the economic contribution of the UK\u2019s Indian diaspora. Now it\u2019s Labour\u2019s Stephen Hepburn, who asks a slightly high-concept question criticising the government\u2019s overall record. The Tory Eddie Hughes asks about female representation at the top of corporations. The answers to both are as you might expect. Brexit again, at last. Tory Henry Smith asks whether the EU contributions for a long delay to departure could be better spent on other areas. May says she wants a brief delay. It is now Labour\u2019s Luke Pollard \u2013 whose birthday it is, the Speaker, John Bercow, notes as he calls him. It\u2019s another question about universal credit, and the problem of weekly rent given the variable payments of UC. May says the issue is manageable. Damien Moore, another Conservative backbencher, asks about disabled access at rail stations. May says progress is being made on the issue. Now it\u2019s the turn of Scottish Lib Dem Jamie Stone, who asks about decommissioning at the Dounreay nuclear plant, and job prospects amid this. May pledges government assistance on this. Another Conservative Brexiter has a question, again not about Brexit. Theresa Villiers asks about police cuts in north London. May says this is a matter for the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. Labour\u2019s Mark Hendrick asks about universal credit and its role in child poverty and food bank use, asking when the government will scrap the new benefit system. May insists UC is a route out of poverty. Conservative backbencher and keen Brexiter Daniel Kawczynski asks about school funding differences between regions, saying his local schools in Shropshire do worse than their equivalents in London. May talks up the new schools funding formula. Labour\u2019s Gill Furniss is up next, asking about the role of UK companies in the ongoing Saudi military offensive in Yemen. May says Britain has strong rules on such issues, and is seeking a ceasefire in the country. Another non-Brexit question: Conservative backbencher Bob Blackman asks about the long-running issue of homes sold under leasehold terms with escalating ground rents. May points to government action on this. Conservative MP Andrew Murrison asks a question about waste incinerators and their impact climate change, getting a positive response from the PM. Next, Labour\u2019s Ronnie Campbell asks about access to a new drug for cystic fibrosis. May said work is being done on this. The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, asks May if the government has offered a second referendum at any point in the Brexit talks with Labour. The PM reiterates that she does not like the plan, but does not wholly answer the question. Blackford\u2019s second question asks if May will accept a long delay to Brexit, and a second referendum. Again, there is no real response. After that fairly brief if concentrated exchange on cuts, Tory MPs Antoinette Sandbach raises this week\u2019s new government plans on internet safety, inviting May to praise it \u2013 which the prime minister happily does. More on council funding. Corbyn says the government has \u201cabandoned communities across the countries\u201d, and reels off a list of closures and cuts. He asks May to admit that her government have been \u201ccruel and unfair\u201d. Not unexpectedly, the PM does not. She responds with yet more statistics, and a somewhat sweeping attack on Labour. Corbyn reiterates his point on the new council funding formula, and stresses the crisis faced by local authorities now. May says councils have had to make \u201csome difficult decisions\u201d and blames the last Labour government for the deficit. Corbyn says new council funding proposals will make the differences between poorer and richer councils even greater. The Labour leader asks why this is happening. May rejects this, saying the new plans will be fairer, and gets in a pre-local elections message about lower council tax under the Conservatives. Using a similar comparison, Corbyn moves on to homelessness, and to child poverty. May again responds with a barrage of part-related statistics. Corbyn moves on to child poverty, noting the connection to funding cuts in poorer areas. He uses Swindon and Surrey as examples where less well-off areas experience greater cuts. May again rebuts this. Jeremy Corbyn speaks now. He begins by noting it is the 21st anniversary of the Good Friday agreement, but then diverts from any Brexit follow-up to ask questions about council cuts, asking why poorest areas are facing the worst of these. May responds by saying councils have a real-terms increase in funding this year. PMQs starts a few minutes late, as often happens these days. An immediately tricky first question for Theresa May, as Tory backbencher Craig Tracey asks whether she agrees a no-deal Brexit would be best. She does not. Prime minister\u2019s questions is is about to start. In the usual way, I will post a snap summary when it is over. A long day for the prime minister is beginning in earnest \u2013 she has left Downing Street for parliament, where she will take prime minister\u2019s questions before heading directly to Brussels. I interviewed MP Nick Boles for Today in Focus today, on Tory travails, leadership hopes and Brexit in general (writes Anushka Asthana, presenter of our daily podcast). Interestingly, despite being a close friend of Michael Gove\u2019s and supporting his leadership bid in 2016, Boles doesn\u2019t think Gove - or anyone else in the current cabinet and linked to the referendum campaign - should be the next leader. Instead, Boles argued that a long campaign, as for David Cameron, could find a younger, more unifying figure who could change the party\u2019s fortunes. On Boris Johnson (who Boles has observed closely), he said \u201cat his best his has an ability to communicate with people at a level of gut\u201d but often there is chaos, concluding: \u201cI don\u2019t think Boris Johnson is fit to be prime minister - no.\u201d Boles also seemed absolutely convinced that Amber Rudd would not back Johnson, adding that she had sacrificed her own chances to take a brave and principles position on Brexit. As for why he ever became a Tory, Boles said that in 1997 he loved Tony Blair, but decided he\u2019d rather be the most leftwing person in the Tories than the most right-wing in Labour. Listen to the full interview here: The UK\u2019s GDP grew by 0.2% year-on-year in the last quarter, the best figure since late 2017, the Office for National Statistics has said \u2013 and it might have been driven in part by Brexit. Industrial production rose by 0.6% in February, with the ONS saying there is some evidence it could have been driven by companies wanting to boost production before Brexit amid stockpiling efforts. More on our business live blog here. While it\u2019s fair to predict that this will not necessarily derail the EU\u2019s thinking, in a sign of the continued fury of Brexiter Conservative MPs, Bill Cash has tweeted a letter he has sent to Donald Tusk warning the European council president that a long extension to Brexit \u201cis likely to be challenged in the UK courts\u201d. The letter is fairly long, but is based on the legal belief of some members of the European Research Group (ERG) of Brexiter Tories that because parliament voted to leave the EU, the government is now bound by that. Cash is a former solicitor, and chaired the ERG\u2019s self-styled \u201cstar chamber\u201d of lawyer-MPs, who decided they could not back May\u2019s plan. The Today programme chat with Barclay did not tell us much \u2013 for the most part he was in line-holding pattern, repeatedly saying that the government still wanted a 30 June extension, batting away most of the questions about what might actually happen. One interesting element was that when asked about how he felt with the EU essentially being in charge, Barclay firmly blamed MPs, rather than the government, returning to the narrative in May\u2019s much-criticised Downing Street statement from last month. Asked about the UK\u2019s powerlessness, Barclay said: That is a consequence of parliament, not the government. The government has agreed a deal with the EU. It is parliament that has forced this on the government. Barclay had little of note to say about what might happen if the talks with Labour definitively broke down without a compromise plan: If they fail, the prime minister has said that we will come back to parliament and look at how we then get clarity on a vote. One of the challenges there will be is how we have a stable majority to pass the legislation that would follow that vote. But, we would come back to parliament and seek to get a consensus on the various options. Good morning. This is Peter Walker, standing in for Andrew Sparrow. He\u2019s in this afternoon, and will take the live blog late into the evening for the emergency European council summit in Brussels. Right now, the UK is officially two days away from leaving the EU without a deal. But this afternoon Theresa May will head to Brussels to seek an extension to Brexit. She wants a delay of no more than 30 June. But the EU27, mindful that the PM has nothing meaningfully new to offer them, after cross-party talks with Labour broke up until Thursday, seem minded to seek a year. Can May accept this? More pertinently, will her cabinet? The Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay \u2013 a man, remember, who last month voted against extending article 50 after arguing in favour of it on behalf of the government \u2013 hinted this morning that he, perhaps, could. Under repeated questioning on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Barclay sort-of-hinted he could, as long as the delay came with a break clause if the UK agrees a deal in the interim \u2013 a flex-tension, in the ever-changing parlance. Asked about a long delay, one that would involve the UK taking part in European parliament elections, he said: I don\u2019t want to see a delay for up to a year. But, the key with any delay is we are able to terminate it once we ratify in order that we can then get on and get a deal through parliament, ratify that agreement and leave the EU. And I think that is what the EU leaders want, it is what the Prime Minister wants. Here is the agenda for the day (all UK times): 11.30am: Commons opens with Northern Ireland questions. 12.00pm: Prime minister\u2019s questions. 4pm-ish: May due to arrive at the summit in Brussels. 5pm: Summit starts, with May speaking to the EU27 before they meet (and dine) without her to decide what happens. Late evening/night: Announcement, and possible press conferences. As with Andrew, I will endeavour to respond to queries, but the sheer number of comments plus a busy day might make it tricky. If you really want to get my attention (or point out a silly error) then try me on Twitter, @peterwalker99",

      "bodyText": "Britain will remain as a member state of the EU until 31 October, with the option to leave earlier if Theresa May can secure Commons support for the Brexit deal, after a Franco-German carve-up of the UK\u2019s future. A marathon six-hour debate among the EU leaders concluded with the prime minister being offered a longer extension than she had sought but providing a new Halloween no deal cliff-edge to focus minds in Westminster. \u201cThis extension is as flexible as I expected and a little bit shorter than I expected but it is still enough to find the best possible solution,\u201d the European council president, Donald Tusk, told a media conference that began after 2am local time. He said of the extra six months of EU membership: \u201cPlease do not waste this time.\u201d The EU would also hold a symbolic June summit to review the UK\u2019s behaviour as a member state following an outspoken intervention by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, about the need to avoid a \u201crogue\u201d Britain undermining the European project. Speaking afterwards, Theresa May repeatedly ducked questions about her future as prime minister, after having previously said she would not accept an extension beyond 30 June. She simply insisted that the UK \u201ccan still leave on May 22 and not hold those European parliamentary elections\u201d if parliament passes the withdrawal deal.

During the day Macron had sought to maintain the pressure on Britain to act with an \u201cenhanced duty of sincere cooperation\u201d during the extra period of membership following the threats from Brexiters, including Jacob Rees-Mogg MP, that the UK could seek to disrupt the bloc from within. The June summit will be an opportunity to \u201ctake stock\u201d but it is not a cliff-edge, Jean-Claude Juncker said. After the new date was announced, Macron said leaders had found \u201cthe best possible compromise\u201d because 31 October preserved EU unity, allowed the British more time and preserved \u201cthe good functioning of the European Union\u201d. The autumn deadline provides an opportunity for the EU to bring Brexit to an end before the conclusion of Juncker\u2019s tenure as European commission president on 1 November. British MEPs would need to be elected on the 23 May if the Commons does not pass the withdrawal agreement by then, or otherwise leave by 1 June. Tusk, who had proposed a full year extension to allow Westminster to break the impasse, said he could not discount the leaders having to deal with a further extension request in October. \u201cI think it is always better to have a piece of something than all of nothing. Six months, more than six months, it could be enough for a good solution if there is a good will and majority for a good solution in the House of Commons.\u201d Tusk added that \u201cmaybe we are not happy but satisfied\u201d, adding that the extra time opened a further opportunity for Britain to \u201crevoke article 50 and cancel Brexit altogether\u201d. Juncker admitted that the long debate among the EU27 had been a \u201cbit difficult\u201d but joked that he liked the deal as his time a commission president would end at midnight on 31 October and he might have to leave a debate about a further extension early. The prime minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, tweeted: \u201cA Brexit extension until 31 October is sensible since it gives time to UK to finally choose its way.

A senior EU source described it as \u201c26 to one\u201d. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had clashed with Macron, both over Berlin\u2019s insistence that May\u2019s government can be trusted, and that a no-deal scenario should not be risked by offering up only a short delay such as one ending on 30 June, as requested by the British prime minister.

She had claimed that the biggest incentive for Conservative MPs to back the deal lay in the threat of having to hold European elections due to a failure to complete Brexit. But Macron warned against such a long extension, arguing that a no-deal threat should remain and that there were insufficient guarantees that the British government would act as a responsible member state. Sources suggested Paris had \u201cgone in hard\u201d, and forced EU capitals towards the shorter date.

The EU27 also emphasised their right to meet without the UK on key long-term decisions. The differences between Paris and Berlin had been evident earlier in the day when Merkel told the Bundestag that May was likely to get a longer extension than she needed, while Macron told reporters on arrival at the summit that \u201cnothing had been decided\u201d, dismissing talk of a long extension as rumours. Macron insisted on clarity from May about what Britain wants, warning: \u201cNothing should compromise the European project.\u201d The Guardian understands that May had not pushed back against the suggestion of a long extension in her one-hour address to the other 27 leaders before their debate, instead insisting that her priority was to be able to leave once the withdrawal agreement was approved. The prime minister also asked the leaders to avoid a situation in which she would have to return to Brussels to ask for a further extension. As EU leaders had gathered to discuss an extension to article 50 of about nine months, May publicly dropped her promise not to allow a delay to Brexit beyond 30 June while she was prime minister. Sources said she would abide by her decision to step down only once a Brexit deal with the EU had been passed by parliament, meaning she looks likely to stay on and keep trying to push through a withdrawal agreement for as long as it takes. Arriving at the talks, May signalled she would accept a much longer delay from EU leaders \u2013 expected to be nine to 12 months \u2013 as long as there was a \u201cbreak clause\u201d allowing the UK to leave as soon as MPs approve a deal with a meaningful vote. \u201cWhat matters, I think, is I have asked for an extension to 30 June but what is important is that any extension enables us to leave at the point at which we ratify a withdrawal agreement. So we could leave on 22 May and start to build our brighter future,\u201d she said. The six-month extension is politically explosive for May because she had promised that \u201cas prime minister\u201d she would not countenance any delay beyond June 30 that would involve the UK having to take part in European elections. Eurosceptics will also be furious that six months is not enough time to replace her as Conservative leader and use the remaining extension for a \u201creset\u201d of Brexit strategy \u2013 through an attempt at fresh negotiations or gaining parliamentary backing for a no-deal exit through a general election. In contrast, it would be enough time for May to negotiate a softer Brexit compromise either with Labour or parliament more widely involving a customs union or even a second referendum. The Guardian understands that the Conservative party rules that protect May from a leadership challenge until 12 December had been a motivating factor in the offer of a lengthy Brexit delay.",
