The 27-year-old striker will fly to Italy on Thursday before undertaking a medical test in Genoa the following day. Gabbiadini signed for Southampton in January 2017 from Napoli in a \u20ac17m [\u00a314.6m] deal and he made an explosive start at St Mary\u2019s, scoring six times in his first four matches \u2013 including two in the EFL Cup final defeat by Manchester United. Remarkably, he would go on to score only six more goals and, after coming on as a late substitute in Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s first game in charge \u2013 at Cardiff on 8 December \u2013 he has not been included in any of the manager\u2019s other squads. Gabbiadini, who had never previously played for a club outside of his native Italy, has had plenty of suitors this month across Europe. He has opted for a return to Serie A, where he will hope to drive Sampdoria, who he played for between 2013-2015 to a strong finish.

The 48-year-old man was arrested at his home in Shepparton on Wednesday night after emergency services spent several hours responding to reports of suspicious packages sent to at least 14 consulates in Melbourne, including those of the UK, US and India. Authorities are yet to confirm what was in the parcels, but early reports suggested they appeared to contain asbestos. In a joint statement, the Australian federal police and Victoria police said the man was charged with sending dangerous articles to be carried by a postal service, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years jail under the Criminal Code Act 1995. The man was scheduled to appear in the Melbourne magistrates court on Thursday. Police said they had so far recovered 29 of the 38 packages and were undertaking forensic testing to determine what they were carrying. They said Australia Post has helped halt the remaining parcels. \u201cPolice have identified all intended recipients and have put processes in place to recover the outstanding packages,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThere is no ongoing threat to the general public.\u201d The first parcel was received at the Argentinian consulate in Sydney on Monday and contained powder in clear plastic bags inside an envelope. The powder was deemed not dangerous by New South Wales police. On Wednesday suspicious packages were received at embassies in Canberra as well as the US, Pakistani, Swiss, Indian, South Korean, New Zealand, Greek, French, Italian, Spanish and Turkish consulates in Melbourne. At least two consulates in Melbourne did not contact authorities about packages until they received an email from the Australian government. The Greek consulate general on St Kilda Road and the Pakistan consulate in Albert Park both received suspect packages but did not contact authorities straight away. Greek vice-consul Georgia Botsiou told SBS Greek radio it had received the package on Friday afternoon. \u201cToday [Wednesday] we received communication from the diplomatic body here in Victoria that there are suspicious packets circulating and that we should contact the police if we\u2019ve received something and we have contacted the police,\u201d Botsiou said, translated from Greek. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have a return address, written on the top was \u2018samples\u2019 and because it didn\u2019t have a return address and without it having a note inside, we thought it was suspicious and because of that, we isolated it from the start.\u201d The Pakistani consulate was delivered a package at 10am on Wednesday morning but contacted authorities only when prompted by an email from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Age reported. DFAT told AAP it had sent an email to all Canberra diplomatic missions on Tuesday. \u201cAfter learning of incidents at three offices in Sydney and Canberra, DFAT sent a note to all diplomatic missions in Canberra on January 8 alerting them to the possibility of suspicious packages being delivered by mail,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cSimilar advice was subsequently provided to consulates around Australia.\u201d \u2022 Australian Associated Press contributed to this report",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn is to reiterate his call for the Brexit impasse to be put to the people in a general election, as Labour edged closer to pledging to call a no-confidence vote in Theresa May\u2019s government if her departure plan is voted down in the Commons. At a speech in Wakefield on Thursday, the Labour leader is to argue that if May is unable to get her flagship piece of legislation past MPs next week then her government will have lost all authority, meaning an election is urgently needed. \u201cSo I say to Theresa May: if you are so confident in your deal, call that election, and let the people decide,\u201d he will say, according to extracts from the speech released in advance. \u201cTo break the deadlock an election is not only the most practical option, it is also the most democratic option. It would give the winning party a renewed mandate to negotiate a better deal for Britain and secure support for it in parliament and across the country.\u201d Labour\u2019s policy on Brexit is to first of all seek a general election, and only if that does not happen to consider the idea of a second referendum, a stance which has prompted some pressure from a membership predominantly keener on another referendum. The party has also avoided specifics on when it might push for an election, something it could force under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act by winning a specifically worded motion of no confidence in the government. On Wednesday, two of Corbyn\u2019s frontbenchers indicated this moment could come very soon after what Labour hopes will be defeat for the government when the delayed vote on May\u2019s Brexit deal finally happens next Tuesday. Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cObviously, the next thing to do immediately after that is for there to be a vote of confidence in the government.\u201d Speaking later on Sky News, Andrew Gwynne, the shadow communities secretary, confirmed the plan. Asked if this meant a confidence vote would come \u201cnext week, basically\u201d if May lost the vote. Gwynne replied: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d According to the extracts of his speech, Corbyn will say Labour will vote against the \u201cbad deal\u201d proposed by the prime minister. \u201cIf the government cannot pass its most important legislation, then there must be a general election at the earliest opportunity,\u201d he will say. \u201cA government that cannot get its business through the House of Commons is no government at all.\u201d On the wider issue of national divisions, Corbyn is to argue that Brexit is more of a symbol than a cause of splits. \u201cThe real divide in our country is not between those who voted to remain in the EU and those who voted to leave. It is between the many, who do the work, create the wealth and pay taxes, and the few, who set the rules, reap the rewards and so often dodge taxes. \u201cIf you\u2019re living in Tottenham, you may well have voted to remain. You\u2019ve got high bills, rising debts, you\u2019re in insecure work, you struggle to make your wages stretch, and you may be on universal credit and accessing food banks. You\u2019re up against it. \u201cIf you\u2019re living in Mansfield, you are likely to have voted to leave. You\u2019ve got high bills, rising debts, you\u2019re in insecure work, you struggle to make your wages stretch, and you may be on universal credit and accessing food banks. You\u2019re up against it.\u201d While some people saw the EU as \u201cpart of an establishment that plunged them into insecurity and hostility\u201d, the real issue was a wider system which entrenched the power of an elite, he will say. During the first prime minister\u2019s questions of 2019 on Wednesday, Corbyn mocked May over what he said was her failure to get any further assurances from EU leaders to placate Tory MPs or her Democratic Unionist party partners since pulling the vote planned for December. \u201cIsn\u2019t the PM bringing back exactly the same deal she admitted would be defeated four weeks ago?\u201d he asked, saying the prime minister was offering only \u201cwindow dressing\u201d. Twice he asked May if she would discount the idea of no deal, especially after MPs backed an amendment to the finance bill from Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper to curb some of the government\u2019s tax administration powers in the event of the UK crashing out of the EU. May responded by saying Corbyn was himself ruling out the only deal acceptable to Brussels. \u201cThe only way to avoid no deal is to vote for the deal,\u201d she said.",

The party\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong, told ABC radio on Thursday Bill Shorten had written to Scott Morrison urging him to accept Qunun. \u201cLabor has been supportive of the government\u2019s moves to consider humanitarian settlement in Australia given she has been found to be owed protection,\u201d Wong said. \u201cShorten did write to the prime minister on Tuesday indicating that if she had a valid claim we support their efforts to offer her settlement in Australia.\u201d Asked if the social media hype around Qunun\u2019s case might spark copycats, Wong said every case had to be considered on its merits. \u201cObviously the fact that it became high profile may have heightened any risk to her should she return, that\u2019s certainly one argument I\u2019ve seen put,\u201d Wong said. Qunun expressed delight overnight that the United Nations refugee agency had granted her refugee status. On Wednesday, the UN high commissioner for refugees found Qunun to be a refugee and referred her to Australia for resettlement. \u201cHey.. I\u2019m happy,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cOh, happy! The whole world knew about the situation of Saudi women and about the brutality and oppression of the government! Our message has arrived.\u201d The 18-year-old woman barricaded herself in a Bangkok airport hotel room on Sunday to prevent her forcible return to Saudi Arabia, where she claims her family would kill her because she has renounced Islam. The Department of Home Affairs said it \u201cwill consider this referral in the usual way, as it does with all UNHCR referrals\u201d. On Wednesday the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, warned there would be \u201cno special treatment\u201d for Qunun. Ordinarily a UNHCR referral to Australia gets put in a queue without priority. The case goes through normal processing such as security and character checks which can take months or even years depending on available information and how easy it is to corroborate, an immigration insider told the Guardian. In this high-profile case, the speed of processing will largely be dependent on whether the minister or department secretary have issued any guidance or priority to the case. A UNHCR spokeswoman told the Guardian that Qunun remained \u201cin a safe location in Bangkok for the time being\u201d. Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, is in Thailand on Thursday for an official visit. As well as the Qunun case she is expected to discuss Hakeem al-Araibi, the Australian permanent resident who has been detained in Thailand for six weeks and fears deportation to Bahrain. The Australian director of Human Rights Watch, Elaine Pearson, said it might take up to a week for a humanitarian visa for Qunun to come through, but she would \u201clove for her to get on a plane with the foreign minister\u201d. Qunun has refused to meet with her father, who arrived in Bangkok on Tuesday. She had said on social media she was afraid of such an encounter. Her father has denied physically abusing her or trying to force her into an arranged marriage, among the reasons she gave for her flight, Thailand\u2019s immigration police chief said after meeting him on Wednesday. The father wanted his daughter back and said his wife had fallen ill from the stress of the situation, Surachate Hakparn said. He described the man as being a governor in Saudi Arabia. \u201cHe has 10 children. He said the daughter might feel neglected sometimes,\u201d Surachate said. Meanwhile, a small group of Australian women held a 45-minute topless protest at the Saudi Arabia consulate general near Martin Place earlier on Thursday.

I assumed this because, ever since I did some temping at 18, I have been astonished it doesn\u2019t happen every day. Employers really do not see you. Many is the time I photocopied confidential documents, updated spreadsheets, logged into a computer that held a wealth of corporate secrets in order to update someone\u2019s diary or otherwise laid eyes on information that could have changed my life if only I\u2019d had the sense to know what to do with it, and the balls to try.</p> <p>Sam (Smith), fortunately, has both. She is a harassed! But loving! But cash-strapped! But good-hearted! But gambling app-addicted and debt-ridden! But hardworking! single mother of two girls, the elder of whom \u2013 Alice \u2013 has a chance at getting into \u201cone of the top dance schools in the country!\u201d with all the expense that will entail.

At first, I assumed it was based on a true story, this tale of a cleaner at a financial firm who discovers there is money to be made from the information she \u2013 as one of the army of invisibles on whom the smooth, hygienic running of the firm depends \u2013 has inadvertent access to. I assumed this because, ever since I did some temping at 18, I have been astonished it doesn\u2019t happen every day. Employers really do not see you. Many is the time I photocopied confidential documents, updated spreadsheets, logged into a computer that held a wealth of corporate secrets in order to update someone\u2019s diary or otherwise laid eyes on information that could have changed my life if only I\u2019d had the sense to know what to do with it, and the balls to try. Sam (Smith), fortunately, has both. She is a harassed! But loving! But cash-strapped! But good-hearted! But gambling app-addicted and debt-ridden! But hardworking! single mother of two girls, the elder of whom \u2013 Alice \u2013 has a chance at getting into \u201cone of the top dance schools in the country!\u201d with all the expense that will entail. She and her husband split up over her gambling and debt-accrual, plus his penchant for banging his massage therapist, and he is now seeking custody of the kids on the grounds that Sam will probably try to sell their hair for another spin on the cyber-roulette wheel.

      "bodyText": "Casey Stoney said she cannot wait to test her team against one of the elite after her Manchester United side passed their latest test against Women\u2019s Super League opposition, an own goal and a Jess Sigsworth strike earning them victory over West Ham in their Continental League Cup quarter-final. With Arsenal and Chelsea beating Birmingham and Reading respectively, and Manchester City playing Brighton in the final last-eight tie on Thursday night, United will get their first taste of life at the top of the league they are aiming to be in next season. Stoney\u2019s side beat London Bees 9-0 in the Championship on Sunday, the heavy wins a regular feature of their season, but the United manager said that brings its own challenges. \u201cIt is difficult when you are winning games by the margins we are to keep the intensity high,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we\u2019re relentless with our standards.\u201d West Ham, fielding the same XI that took the lead before losing 4-2 to Arsenal on Sunday, switched to a back three for the trip to Leigh, with Claire Rafferty and Ria Percival pushed further forward. However the reshaped side struggled to have an impact in the first half. Their manager, Matt Beard, said the changes were forced by trying to work around injuries. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing well with a 4-3-3 but we had too many players not in their natural positions so we changed it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to take responsibility for that. We\u2019re trying to get the best available players in their best positions but it\u2019s backfired on me tonight.\u201d The hosts started on the front foot and with Kirsty Smith, Alex Greenwood and the brilliant 17-year-old Lauren James linking well on the left it was not surprising the breakthrough came from there. James raced down the wing and sent in a dangerous cross and, in the scramble to get there ahead of Jess Sigsworth, Kate Longhurst stuck out a leg and poked the ball into her own net. Jane Ross, who scored twice on Sunday, was then brilliantly thwarted by Siobhan Chamberlain from six yards, leaving Stoney full of praise for her keeper. \u201cSiobhan makes a massive save at 1-0,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we go in 1-1 then it\u2019s a different game and it mentally tests us because we\u2019ve not been behind or level much. We switched off a little and she came alive, that\u2019s why I signed her, she knows how to keep herself in the game.\u201d Not long after the restart Beard, had his head in his hands. A goal-kick from Becky Spencer was knocked down for Longhurst who rattled the post with a half-volley from 30 yards. West Ham were left ruing their luck minutes later when Sigsworth smashed the ball into the corner after the visitors were dispossessed in the final third. Beard was fuming at the lack of a free-kick in the buildup. \u201cI\u2019ve been in to see them about the second goal,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say it was shoulder to shoulder but Longhurst has a mark on her back. At the end of the day he\u2019s given it and we have to recover as a team on the pitch and we didn\u2019t do that.\u201d United continued to look the more dangerous side but Percival smacked an effort against the foot of the post from distance as West Ham mounted a late push. \u201cThey\u2019re a WSL team. Every player on that pitch has been playing for WSL teams,\u201d said Beard. \u201cThey made the decision to go into the Championship and it\u2019s been a good decision for them. I watched their London Bees game and the fitness levels between the two teams was night and day and it\u2019s been like that most of the season.\u201d United go into the pot for the semi-final, just five months into their first season. \u201cThere\u2019s no easy team,\u201d said Stoney. \u201cWe won\u2019t be expected to win against any of them but what a challenge for these players.

Poor Burton. You wait your entire existence to reach the last four of a major cup competition and then you get drawn against this lot. Burton are ninth in League One and, being brutally honest, they probably don\u2019t stand much of a chance of making it to Wembley for next month\u2019s final.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Daniel Taylor\u2019s match report from the Etihad Stadium. That\u2019s all from me tonight. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye. Just the 16 goals for Manchester City in the last four days. Poor Rotherham. Poor Burton Albion. The second leg on 23 January will be a sight to behold. Burton tried so hard after going 9-0 down. And they kept it to single figures with a backs-to-the-wall effort. A victory of sorts, I suppose. Embarrassment for City as they fail to hit 10 against the League One side. 90 min+1: David Silva has a shot blocked. 90 min: There will be two added minutes. Burton have everyone back. They really don\u2019t want to concede again. 87 min: Zinchenko\u2019s header, Otamendi\u2019s header, Collins\u2019s save. It isn\u2019t 10 yet. 86 min: Very good, John. 85 min: The crowd are urging City to hit double figures. Magic of the cup. Phil Foden sends Bernardo Silva away down the left. Bernardo\u2019s cross finds Mahrez, who scuffs his first shot before adjusting well to scoop the ball low to the right of Collins with his left foot. Burton have never faced anything remotely resembling this before. This is absolutely ridiculous. 81 min: Jesus runs on to a long pass over the top, waits for support and plays the ball back to Mahrez, who sees his shot deflected over by a brilliant block from Buxton. 79 min: Joe Sbarra replaces Scott Fraser. 78 min: Maybe not. Silva\u2019s deflected shot hits the post and out goes for a corner. 77 min: City are playing keep ball. They might be letting Burton off now. 74 min: Danilo replace Kyle Walker. Burton are in big trouble now. 73 min: Fair play to City, though, they\u2019ve matched West Ham\u2019s 8-0 win over Macclesfield earlier in the tournament. 72 min: Maybe ... maybe ... maybe it would have been different if Harness had made it 1-1 in the first half. Riyad Mahrez crosses first time from the left and Kyle Walker clips a cushioned shot home from 12 yards. Good finish. Well done. 68 min: Ben Fox replaces Jamie Allen. David Templeton replaces Liam Boyce. 67 min: Bernardo Silva replaces Leroy Sane. A raking pass finds Sane on the left. He takes it on his chest before flicking a ball through Brayford\u2019s legs with the outside of his boot, teeing up Jesus to turn past Collins from close range. This isn\u2019t a fair fight. Can\u2019t they blow up now? 64 min: Sane skitters down the left and pulls the ball back to Silva, who astonishes everyone by scooping over from close range. He looks disgusted with himself. Another pass from Gundogan releases Jesus. The Brazilian slams his shot straight at Collins but the rebound runs to Foden, who sets himself before drilling past the man on the line for his second goal in two games. He\u2019s only been on the pitch four minutes! 58 min: Phil Foden replaces Kevin de Bruyne. After a quiet start to the second half, David Silva slips a pass through to Riyad Mahrez on the right. From the byline, the Algerian dinks a cross into the middle and Jesus heads his third past Collins. The Brazilian completes his hat-trick! 54 min: \u201cCan we discuss the Burton Albion badge for a moment,\u201d says Ryan Foley. \u201cPerhaps the most stupidly awesome badge in the top four divisions. The depicted footballer looks like a Sunday league player based on the prodigious belly. He also appears to be wearing boots. Like not football cleats/boots\u2014actual boots. Wellingtons, perhaps.\u201d 52 min: Akins\u2019s cutback is swept over by Fraser from the edge of the area. 48 min: Foden please! 46 min: Manchester City get the second half underway. Sane gets in down the left straight away but his control lets him down. It\u2019s been one of the great cup semi-finals. 45 min: No penalty. The Burton fans cheer ironically. 44 min: Gabriel Jesus goes down with a knock on his ankle. Turner caught him just inside the area. \u201cVAR! VAR!\u201d chant the crowd. They\u2019re having a look. 42 min: De Bruyne sends Sane clear on the left. The German\u2019s low ball makes it to Mahrez after an error from Hutchinson, but Collins brilliantly turns the winger\u2019s sharp volley over. 40 min: City should have to even this up playing with Roger Johnson in central defence in the second half. Even their crosses are going in now. Leroy Sane plays a pass back to Zinchenko, who looks to deliver from the left. He overhits it but it catches out Collins, who can\u2019t stop the left-back\u2019s cross from sailing over his head and into the top-left corner. Zinchenko has the good grace to look embarrassed. No doubt he\u2019d have preferred to score his first goal for City in different circumstances. This isn\u2019t fair. Mike Dean waits a moment and then gets word that David Silva was just onside when Ilkay Gundogan picked him out. Replays show it was the right call. As for what happened with the goal itself, Silva was able to cushion the ball across to Jesus, all alone in the middle of the area, and the Brazilian took a touch before slamming a shot home off the inside of the left post. David Silva might have been offside. This is getting ugly. Another easy goal. Ilkay Gundogan carves Burton open with a lovely pass through to Leroy Sane, who\u2019s popped up on the right. Sane\u2019s takes the ball on his chest, with Akins dozing, and advances on goal. Collins does well to save but the rebound loops into the six-yard box and Gabriel Jesus heads into the empty net. The crowd goes wild. 27 min: I\u2019m not surprised there\u2019s a low crowd at the Etihad this one. It might be a semi-final but Burton are a League One side. That said, it\u2019s creating a weird, low-key atmosphere and it seems to have led to a lack of intensity on the pitch. 25 min: A speedy City counterattack ends with Jesus cutting inside and skimming a shot wide from the left. 22 min: Silva drives a low ball across the face of goal. Hutchinson hacks clear. Then De Bruyne lifts another pass over the top to Sane, who\u2019s astonished no one in blue is there to attack his cross into the six-yard box. Gabriel Jesus could do with pulling his finger out. 20 min: Allen whacks a shot well over from 25 yards. 18 min: Mahrez runs on to a lofted pass from Gundogan and pops the ball into the net. Flag\u2019s up, though. No need for VAR. Mahrez knew he was off. 16 min: Burton are causing a few problems, you know. They get the ball into the area and Boyce uses his physicality to win a corner. Nothing comes from it, though. 15 min: Sane\u2019s delivery from the left hasn\u2019t been right yet. But he\u2019s found so much space in these opening stages, he\u2019s bound to sort it out eventually. 12 min: Burton creep forward - and contrive a dreadful miss! Akins, who\u2019s showing no fear on the ball, takes City on down the left and fizzes a low cross into the middle. The ball skids all the way to the far post, where Zinchenko\u2019s been pulled out of position and runs all the way to Harness. Eight yards out and totally unmarked, he should equalise; instead he sticks his effort into the upper tier. Oh dear. They aren\u2019t going to get many of those. 10 min: De Bruyne, who appears to be in the zone, snipes a pass through to Sane. It\u2019s just overhit, though. Collins races from his line to smother the danger. But you know it won\u2019t be long before another City attack. In fact, as I was saying: Mahrez slips Walker in on the right, but his cutback\u2019s hacked away. 8 min: Gundogan\u2019s dangerous cross is headed away. 7 min: City win a free-kick deep on the left. Another chance. Burton had just survived a scramble in their own area but this goal has been coming. City immediately construct another attack and Silva\u2019s given too much space to lift his head and whip a cross into the middle from the left. De Bruyne, breaking from midfield, is unmarked to steer a low header past Collins. So simple. Nigel Clough sits slumped in his chair. It\u2019s the look of a man who thinks it could be a long evening. It didn\u2019t take long. 3 min: Sane\u2019s cross from the left is headed away as far as Zinchenko, who fires wide from 20 yards. 2 min: Moments later, De Bruyne lifts a pass over the top for Mahrez. The Algerian\u2019s onside but he takes his eye off the ball and miscontrols. He would have been clear on goal. Peep! Burton, all in yellow, get the game underway and they have a shot within the first 10 seconds! Here we go, eh? It\u2019s Akins who has it, letting fly from 20 yards, but it\u2019s an easy save for Muric. What a start from the underdogs, though! Here come the teams. Manchester City and Burton Albion. In a different era this could have been something from the old Division Two. Not these days, mind you. Things have changed in these parts. Just a reminder: VAR will be in use tonight. Here\u2019s hoping for more technology fun and games. Nigel Clough speaks! \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult but the team picks itself in some ways. Losing Stephen Quinn is a big blow. We have to dream but we just try to play our normal team. I want us to go and play a little bit if we can. We don\u2019t want to give the ball away in silly areas but I want the players to be confident.\u201d Pep Guardiola speaks! \u201cAlmost everybody is fit except Sergio and Vincent. Kevin de Bruyne and David Silva need minutes. They need rhythm. When you are four or five months injured, you need minutes for the pace.\u201d I did some news! Like a real proper journalist! Pre-match reading Manchester City: Muric; Walker, Otamendi, Garcia, Zinchenko; Gundogan; Mahrez, Silva De Bruyne, Sane; Jesus. Subs: Ederson, Danilo, Stones, Sterling, Delph, Bernardo, Foden. Burton Albion: Collins; Brayford, Buxton, Turner, Hutchinson; Wallace, Allen, Fraser, Harness; Boyce, Akins. Subs: Bywater, McFadzean, Sbarra, Templeton, Fox, McCrory, Miller. Referee: Sir Mike Dean. Hello. Not to sound too pessimistic about Burton Albion\u2019s chances here, but it\u2019s difficult to look past Manchester City warming up for this League Cup semi-final by walloping Rotherham 7-0. Seems there\u2019s no such thing as a day off in Pep Guardiola\u2019s world. City\u2019s manager could, of course, have shown that he is bigger fish to fry than the quaint old FA Cup by starting himself and Mikel Arteta in midfield against Rotherham.

Jesus added his second with a left-footed finish from Silva\u2019s pass and soon afterwards Oleksandr Zinchenko\u2019s swirling shot, from an angle from which most people might have anticipated a cross, soared over Bradley Collins, Burton\u2019s goalkeeper, for the game\u2019s outstanding goal.</p> \n<p>Jesus completed his hat-trick with a fine leap to convert a Riyad Mahrez cross and his fourth goal was a neatly clipped finish from Leroy San\u00e9\u2019s low delivery. In between, the substitute Phil Foden had made it six just a few minutes after replacing De Bruyne. Again, Jesus was prominently involved and, when the Brazilian\u2019s shot was blocked, Foden was following up to direct the loose ball into the net.</p> \n<p>Kyle Walker was next to get in on the act after another brilliantly incisive exchange of passes and, at 8-0, it was intriguing to see whether Guardiola\u2019s players might ease off in the last 20 minutes. Not a chance. The pressure on Burton\u2019s goal was near-unremitting. Mahrez prodded in the ninth and that, thankfully for Burton, was that.</p>",

Burton suddenly looked very lost. Jesus added his second with a left-footed finish from Silva\u2019s pass and soon afterwards Oleksandr Zinchenko\u2019s swirling shot, from an angle from which most people might have anticipated a cross, soared over Bradley Collins, Burton\u2019s goalkeeper, for the game\u2019s outstanding goal. Jesus completed his hat-trick with a fine leap to convert a Riyad Mahrez cross and his fourth goal was a neatly clipped finish from Leroy San\u00e9\u2019s low delivery. In between, the substitute Phil Foden had made it six just a few minutes after replacing De Bruyne. Again, Jesus was prominently involved and, when the Brazilian\u2019s shot was blocked, Foden was following up to direct the loose ball into the net. Kyle Walker was next to get in on the act after another brilliantly incisive exchange of passes and, at 8-0, it was intriguing to see whether Guardiola\u2019s players might ease off in the last 20 minutes. Not a chance. The pressure on Burton\u2019s goal was near-unremitting. Mahrez prodded in the ninth and that, thankfully for Burton, was that.",

Steyer announced he would not pursue a presidential bid at an event in Des Moines, Iowa, on Wednesday afternoon. Steyer, who earned his fortune as a hedge fund manager, has appeared around the country to organize around his Need to Impeach group, an effort to encourage support for the impeachment of Donald Trump. The group built a formidable email list of more than 6 million people committed to removing Trump from office. \u201cThe impeachment question has reached an inflection point. That\u2019s why I just announced that I will be dedicating 100% of my time and effort in 2019 towards Mr Trump\u2019s impeachment and removal from office,\u201d said Steyer. The news was first reported by the New York Times. He announced on Wednesday that he commit another $40m of his fortune to the group and defined success as either the House beginning impeachment proceedings or Trump resigning from office. The billionaire outlined the initial steps that his group would take including town halls in Nevada, New Hampshire and Washington DC over the next month, as well as efforts to organize in the districts of key Democratic congressional committee chairs and an \u201cimpeachment summit\u201d to be held in late January in Washington DC. Steyer noted the unusual location for a potential candidate to announce that they would not pursue a campaign in his remarks. \u201cMost people come to Iowa around this time to announce a campaign for president but I am proud to be here to announce that I\u2019ll do whatever it takes for as long as it takes to remove a president,\u201d he said. The San Francisco Democrat has poured his fortune into progressive causes in recent years.

But that would probably only give equity prices a small and temporary extra boost, given the prospects for demand in the world\u2019s two largest economies.</p> <p>To re-cap, equity prices have recovered across the board since last Thursday. In local currency terms, MSCI\u2019s USA Index has risen by roughly 5%; its World ex USA Index (of equities in other developed economies) by 3%; and its Emerging Markets Index by 2%. This is a big change from the prior three months, when the indices fell by about 16%, 13% and 8%, respectively.</p> <p>The recovery in equity prices appears to have been partly driven by the news about the trade talks this week in Beijing. Expectations were low coming into the talks, due to a lack of high-level representation from the US and China. So bullish noises from President Trump about the prospect of a deal has had ample scope to buoy sentiment. Clearly, equity prices could get a further lift if there is some positive announcement in the coming days. But we would expect any boost to be small, as well as more than unwound, during 2019.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c361b04e4b02fb91ff1136e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-09T16:09:29.459Z\">4.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Carney: Yuan coud become new reserve currency</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Speaking of China, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has suggested that the renminbi could become a new reserve currency, alongside the US dollar.</strong></p> <p>Speaking on an online web forum on the future of money, Carney said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cAs the world re-orders, this disconnect between the real and financial is likely to reduce, and in the process other reserve currencies may emerge.

      "bodyText": "And finally, Wall Street has racked up its fourth day of gains in a row. Investors shrugged off the news that president Trump had walked out of a meeting with congressional leaders over the shutdown..... ....clinging instead to hopes that the US and China are making headway in their trade talks. The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.4% to around 2,585. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 91 points higher (also +0.4%) to 23,878, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.9%. Goodnight! GW Back in New York, shares are holding onto their earlier gains - after it emerged that some US central bankers argued against last month\u2019s interest rate hike. The minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s December meeting, released this afternoon, showed that a few officials pushed for a pause. They argued that weak inflation readings allowed the central bank \u201csome latitude to wait and see\u201d how economic conditions developed, given financial market tensions and worries over the global economic outlook. Such dovish inclinations may indicate the Fed will be reluctant to raise interest rates in 2019 (although it all depends on the data!). Still, it\u2019s enough to keep the Dow 149 points higher in late trading at 23,937, a rise of around 0.6%. Boom! Britain\u2019s blue-chip index of top shares has closed at its highest level since 5th December, helped by trade war optimism. The FTSE 100 closed 45 point higher at 6906, a gain of 0.66%. UK housebuilder Taylor Wimpey ended the day as the top FTSE 100 riser, after it reassured investors that current trading is solid. Most other European markets have also posted gains, with France\u2019s CAC up 1% and Germany\u2019s DAX gaining 0.9%. Stocks are also higher in Wall Street. Optimism that the US and China are inching towards a trade deal is rife.......but it may also be over the top. Robert Lighthizer\u2019s statement makes it clear that a deal hasn\u2019t been signed off yet. John Higgins of Capital Economics fears that markets will fall back soon: The rebound in global equity prices since last Thursday has coincided with growing optimism that the US and China are about to strike a trade deal. But that would probably only give equity prices a small and temporary extra boost, given the prospects for demand in the world\u2019s two largest economies. To re-cap, equity prices have recovered across the board since last Thursday. In local currency terms, MSCI\u2019s USA Index has risen by roughly 5%; its World ex USA Index (of equities in other developed economies) by 3%; and its Emerging Markets Index by 2%. This is a big change from the prior three months, when the indices fell by about 16%, 13% and 8%, respectively. The recovery in equity prices appears to have been partly driven by the news about the trade talks this week in Beijing. Expectations were low coming into the talks, due to a lack of high-level representation from the US and China. So bullish noises from President Trump about the prospect of a deal has had ample scope to buoy sentiment. Clearly, equity prices could get a further lift if there is some positive announcement in the coming days. But we would expect any boost to be small, as well as more than unwound, during 2019. Speaking of China, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has suggested that the renminbi could become a new reserve currency, alongside the US dollar. Speaking on an online web forum on the future of money, Carney said: \u201cAs the world re-orders, this disconnect between the real and financial is likely to reduce, and in the process other reserve currencies may emerge. In the first instance, I would expect these will be existing national currencies, such as the RMB [renminbi]\u201d. Carney has also fielded several questions about digital currencies, and suggested the Bank of England could issue its own version (a central bank digital currency). He says: The Bank has an open mind about the eventual development of a CBDC and has an active research and pilot programme dedicated to it. That said, given current technological shortcomings in distributed ledger a true, widely available reliable CBDC is still a long-term prospect. You can see the Q&amp;A online here. The early rally in New York is slightly fizzling out as traders digest the US trade representative\u2019s statement on the China trade talks: In London, the FTSE 100 is still up 50 point at 6910, a five-week high. Here\u2019s the full statement from the US Trade Representative on this week\u2019s talks with China (it\u2019s also online here): On January 7-9, an official delegation from the United States led by Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Jeffrey Gerrish held meetings in Beijing with Chinese officials to discuss ways to achieve fairness, reciprocity, and balance in trade relations between our two countries. The officials also discussed the need for any agreement to provide for complete implementation subject to ongoing verification and effective enforcement. The meetings were held as part of the agreement reached by President Donald J. Trump and President Xi Jinping in Buenos Aires to engage in 90 days of negotiations with a view to achieving needed structural changes in China with respect to forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection, non-tariff barriers, cyber intrusions and cyber theft of trade secrets for commercial purposes, services, and agriculture. The talks also focused on China\u2019s pledge to purchase a substantial amount of agricultural, energy, manufactured goods, and other products and services from the United States. The United States officials conveyed President Trump\u2019s commitment to addressing our persistent trade deficit and to resolving structural issues in order to improve trade between our countries. The delegation will now report back to receive guidance on the next steps. More snap reaction: Reading the USTR\u2019s statement, it\u2019s clear that China and America have been talking about the big issues at the heart of their trade dispute. That\u2019s encouraging...but three days of talks, however intensive, haven\u2019t (yet) delivered the deal that both sides are hoping for. Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative, seems to be signalling that the battle isn\u2019t over. Not a huge surprise - trade wars are rarely as \u2018easy to win\u2019 as Donald Trump tweeted 10 month ago. Here\u2019s some snap reaction: Breaking! America\u2019s trade negotiators have just released a statement following their three-day talks in Beijing. The Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) says that the talks \u201cdiscussed ways to achieve fairness, reciprocity and balance\u201d in trade relations between the two powers, and the need for \u201ceffective enforcement\u201d of any deal. The USTR added that talks focused on China\u2019s pledge to buy \u201ca substantial amount\u201d of energy, manufactured foods and agricultural products from the US (to narrow the trade gap between them). They also covered \u201cstructural changes\u201d to China\u2019s trade policies, to protect US firms\u2019 intellectual property and prevent technology being transferred to Chinese firms. The USTR will now \u201creport back\u201d to the White House, and seek guidance on its next steps. The FTSE 100\u2019s rally this week will bring welcome relief to investors, who suffered as the blue-chip index tumbled by 12% last year. And as this chart shows, the Footsie is still roughly its value a decade ago, after it was driven down to just 3,500 points after the financial crisis. Ding ding. Wall Street is rallying in early trading, sending the Dow Jones industrial average up by over 0.5% (130 points) to 23917. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, suspects that Donald Trump has a cunning plan, to announce a trade deal with China at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland in two weeks time. He writes: The way that trade talks work is that the hard graft is done at official level so that 99% of a deal is concluded before political leaders become involved. Significantly, talks between Trump and China\u2019s vice-president, Wang Qishan, are due to take place at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos later this month \u2013 an ideal place to declare that the trade war is over. In a sense, it is strange that Trump has agreed to be the headline act in Davos for a second straight year because his message to his political base is that he has no time for the \u201cglobalisers\u201d who make the annual pilgrimage to the Swiss Alps. However, Trump is a showman. He loved being the centre of attention in Davos last year and would like nothing better than to announce to all the free traders at the WEF that his hard-nosed protectionist approach had paid off. A salient point: With European indices still up over 1% today, the markets are showing confidence that China and the US are making progress in their trade dispute. Karen Ward, chief market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, has made timely point -- the US and China are a long way apart, and it will take a major breakthrough to end their dispute. She told CNBC: I think (the deal) would have to be extremely far-reaching for the markets to breath an enormous sigh of relief,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think, unfortunately, that (the trade war) is something that will disappear from our horizon for the full year&gt;\u201d After three days of gains, Wall Street is expected to rise further when trading begins in under 90 minutes. Entrepreneur Elon Musk has been doing his bit for US-China relations this week. Musk\u2019s electric car maker, Tesla, broke ground on a new factory at Shanghai this week - its first one outside the States. Beijing\u2019s top economic official, Premier Li Keqiang, met Musk in the Great Hall of the People, and wished him the best of luck in China: \u201cWe hope you can get a firm foothold and expand the market. We hope your company can become an in-depth participant in China\u2019s opening and a promoter of the stability of Chinese-U.S. relations.\u201d An end to the US-China trade war can\u2019t some soon enough for some American farmers. Exports of soybeans slumped last autumn after Beijing imposed tariffs on imported US goods. That hurt America\u2019s agriculture sector badly, as soybean prices fell to 10-year lows. Washington responded to farmers\u2019 suffering by launching the Market Facilitation Program, a multi-billion dollar subsidy programme. But now there\u2019s a new problem \u2013 the ongoing US shutdown means payments aren\u2019t being made! Heads-up: China and the US will both release statements about this week\u2019s trade talks on Thursday, according to Hu Xijin, editor of Global Times. That\u2019s another indication that some progress has been achieved this week (but probably not a final deal, if Donald Trump is planning talks in Davos). Hu has also heard that negotiations were \u201cpleasant and candid\u201d. After three hours of trading, the FTSE 100 is sitting comfortably higher at 6,962 points, up 66 points or almost 1%. That\u2019s its highest level since 5th December 2018, clawing back the heavy losses suffered late last yet (when the Footsie hit a 28-month low of 6,536). Virtually every sector is up, led by tech firms and consumer-focused companies. Housebuilders continue to rally too, following Taylor Wimpey\u2019s upbeat statement to the City (see 9.30am) The upbeat noises from Beijing about progress at the US-China trade talks continues to boost risk appetite. Vincent-Fre\u011bde\u011bric Mivelaz of Swissquote Bank says further progress could come at the World Economic Forum later this month: Equities are rallying on optimism that the US-China trade dispute might be resolved. A scheduled two days of negotiation was extended by a third day, suggesting things are going well. The arrival of US officials from energy, agriculture and treasury departments is a good sign that discussions are becoming more explicit on topics such as intellectual property and trade deficit. The next step will come at the 2019 World Economic Forum in Davos (22 January), where US President Donald Trump and China Vice-President Wang Qishan will meet. Some good news: unemployment in the euro area has hit a new 10-year low. The jobless rate dipped to 7.9% in November, down from 8.0% in October 2018 and from 8.7% in November 2017. That still leaves just over 13m people out of work in the euro area, and almost 16.5m in the wider EU (where unemployment is its lowest since Eurostat started counting in 2000). Eurostat says: Among the Member States, the lowest unemployment rates in November 2018 were recorded in Czechia (1.9%), Germany (3.3%) and the Netherlands (3.5%). The highest unemployment rates were observed in Greece (18.6% in September 2018) and Spain (14.7%). Compared with a year ago, the unemployment rate fell in all Member States except Estonia where it remained stable. The largest decreases were registered in Croatia (from 10.0% to 7.8%), Greece (from 20.8% to 18.6% between September 2017 and September 2018) and Spain (from 16.5% to 14.7%). Newsflash: Sales of cars in China fell last year, for the first time in at least 20 years. The China Passenger Car Association has reported that car sales fell by 6% in 2018 to 22.7 million units last year. Such a sharp annual decline is a strong signal that Chinese consumers are being hit by the slowing economy, and by the tariffs imposed by the US last year. The 25% slump on the Chinese stock market in 2018 will also have hit many consumers in the pocket. It will fuel concerns that China could suffer a hard landing, unless Beijing takes steps to boost domestic demand and there is a significant breakthrough in the trade talks. Sales will also have suffered from the ending of government subsidies for vehicle purchases last year. UK baker chain Greggs is among the top risers in London, up 7.5%, after posting sparkling results. Fresh from launching a vegan sausage roll to a (mostly) grateful nation, Greggs has hikes its pre-tax profit forecasts from \u00a386m to \u00a388m after a strong end to trading last year. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains how bumper sales of festive bake and mince pies boosted sales: Greggs has prided itself on adapting products to suit changing consumer tastes, and said its latest creation, the \u00a31 vegan sausage roll, was proving popular with \u201ca broad range of customers\u201d. The vegan sausage roll hit Greggs\u2019 shelves last week, coinciding with the beginning of Veganuary, a growing movement that encourages people to embrace plant-based diets during January. It is on sale in 950 of Greggs\u2019s 1,950 UK shops. Greggs has increased sales and profits despite a tough backdrop for high street retailers struggling with rising business costs, a switch to online spending and faltering consumer confidence as Brexit looms. More here: Plus a bonus poem: Markets are doing their best to climb out of the hole they tumbled into late last year, says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. The blue chip FTSE 100 index is up 2.6% year-to-date which sends hope to investors that market weakness seen in the second half of 2018 may not necessarily turn into a sustained downward trend. \u201cHousebuilders, tobacco, miners, engineers and retailers all look strong on the London market on Wednesday. The rest of Europe and Asia also pushed ahead, following similar strength on the US market last night. \u201cHopes of progress with US-China trade talks are certainly giving markets support, so too a lack of major shocks among corporate trading updates in general. UK housebuilder Taylor Wimpey is the top riser on the FTSE 100 this morning, up over 5%. It reassured the City this morning that business looks solid, saying: \u201cWe continue to see solid forward sales indicators and start the year with a very strong order book. Analysts have warned that housebuilders would suffer badly from a no-deal Brexit, which could crush consumer confidence, hit growth and potentially force interest rates up to protect the pound. Shares in European car makers are jumping, with Daimler up 3%, Volkswagen, up 2.75% and BMW up 2%. They\u2019ve all suffered from recent US-China tensions; last month, China reportedly began cutting tariffs on American-built cars. President Trump is desperate to strike a trade deal with China to drive stocks up again, Bloomberg reports. They say: According to people familiar with the matter, Trump\u2019s willingness to cut a deal with Beijing is driven in large part by his desire for markets to rally. He publicly said he\u2019s eager to make a deal that benefits both sides while also stressing that China\u2019s slowing economy and falling stock market signal the country is more desperate than the U.S. for a speedy outcome. Having made Wall Street\u2019s performance a key measure of his performance, Trump will not have enjoyed last month\u2019s rout -- the worst December since 1931. 2019 is starting brighter. Today\u2019s rally has driven the FTSE 100 to a four-week high, clawing back December\u2019s losses. Trade deal hopes have sent European stocks higher in early trading. In London, the FTSE 100 index of top blue-chip shares is up 45 points (0.7%), and there are similar gains in Paris and Frankfurt. European traders are picking up the baton from their Asia-Pacific colleagues: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says the City is cheered by \u201chopes of a resolution to the [US-China trade] dispute before the end of a 90 day truce at the end of February\u201d. US officials have also confirmed that the trade negotiations with China are concluding.....and even hinted that they went well. Reuters has the details: The U.S. trade delegation in Beijing is wrapping up meetings with Chinese officials and will return to the United States later on Wednesday, a U.S. official said. Ted McKinney, U.S. Under Secretary of Agriculture for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs, made the comments to reporters at the delegation\u2019s hotel. \u201cI think they went just fine,\u201d McKinney said of the talks. He declined to answer further questions. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Hopes of a trade agreement between the US and China are gripping the markets today. After three days of negotiations, talks between the two sides in Beijing have just concluded - and there\u2019s real optimism of a breakthrough. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang has just told a daily news briefing on Wednesday that trade talks have concluded and the results will be released very soon. Lu added that the \u201clonger-than-expected\u201d talks show that China is very serious about getting a deal. Officials had expected to wrap up on Tuesday, but surprised observers by returning to the negotiating table for a third day. The two countries need to reach a deal before March 1, else the US will hike tariffs on some $200 billion in Chinese goods from 10% to 25%. Hopes of a deal pushed Asian stock markets to their highest levels in three weeks today. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite index is up 1%, as is Japan\u2019s Topix, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng has jumped by 2%. Investors are also cheered by reports that Beijing plans new policies to boost domestic demand. Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada explains: Markets have more sugar hits to cheer overnight, helping equities claw back more of their December losses. Reports that China is planning fresh measures to boost domestic consumption have sent shares in large Chinese carmakers and appliance manufacturers higher, though details are scarce. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 is expected to open 60 points higher, up 0.8%, having gained 50 points yesterday. Also coming up today There\u2019s a flurry of Christmas trading updates from UK retailers, including supermarket chain Sainsbury\u2019s, bakers Greggs and Majestic Wine. Sainsbury\u2019s seem to have missed expectations, with like-for-like sales down over 1%. Economists will also be digesting new trade data from Germany, following a worrying drop in industrial output yesterday.

One senior party member suggested: \u201cVox aren\u2019t all there.\u201d</p> <p>In a joint statement, the PP and Vox said the new regional government, led by the PP\u2019s Juanma Moreno, would focus on \u201ccreating proper jobs\u201d and fighting corruption.</p> <p>Vox was formed by disgruntled PP members five years ago and made a major breakthrough in December\u2019s regional election, winning 12 seats with 11% of the vote and becoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/09/far-right-andalucia-seville-vox-party-shockwave-spanish-politics\">the first far-right party to win representation</a> since Spain returned to democracy after Francisco Franco\u2019s death.</p> <p>Also among its 19 proposals were laws to \u201cprotect\u201d bullfighting, flamenco and Holy Week celebrations, and a request that Andaluc\u00eda\u2019s regional day be changed to commemorate the 1492 conclusion of the Christian reconquest of Spain seven centuries after the first Moorish armies arrived.</p> <p>Its leader, Santiago Abascal, has raged against what he calls <a href=\"https://twitter.com/santi_abascal/status/1080765789966397440\">\u201csupremacist feminism and gender totalitarianism\u201d</a>, and the party has complained that existing domestic violence laws are unfairly weighted against men.</p> <p>Vox\u2019s rise has pushed the PP, led by Pablo Casado, further to the right. While it has abandoned its more radical demands in Andaluc\u00eda, the upstart party has now further revealed its ability to shape the political debate and win symbolic concessions from the mainstream right.</p> <p>The EU and the French government both expressed concerns this week over the rhetoric and manoeuvrings since December\u2019s election.</p> <p>The European commission\u2019s chief spokesman, <a href=\"https://www.europapress.es/nacional/noticia-bruselas-no-valora-negociaciones-formar-gobierno-andaluz-ve-prioritaria-igualdad-mujeres-hombres-20190107135106.html\">Margaritis Schinas</a>, declined to comment on the formation of the regional government, but said: \u201cFor us, fundamental rights, parity, and equality between men and women remain an absolute political priority.\u201d</p> <p>France\u2019s minister for European affairs, Nathalie Loiseau, was more explicit.

      "bodyText": "The far-right Spanish political party Vox has agreed to support a new, rightwing Andaluc\u00edan regional government after dropping its demands for the expulsion of 52,000 \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d and the repeal of laws on domestic violence and gender equality. Vox, which secured its first parliamentary seats in December\u2019s Andaluc\u00edan election, had also called for Spain\u2019s autonomous regional governments to surrender the responsibilities for education, health and public order that they were handed after the end of the Franco dictatorship. But on Wednesday evening the far-right party said it would support a coalition between the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) and the centre-right Citizens party that is intended to end 36 years of Socialist party rule in the southern Spanish region. Although Vox had described its 19 proposals as \u201cvery reasonable\u201d, they were dismissed by the PP as \u201cunacceptable nonsense\u201d. One senior party member suggested: \u201cVox aren\u2019t all there.\u201d In a joint statement, the PP and Vox said the new regional government, led by the PP\u2019s Juanma Moreno, would focus on \u201ccreating proper jobs\u201d and fighting corruption. Vox was formed by disgruntled PP members five years ago and made a major breakthrough in December\u2019s regional election, winning 12 seats with 11% of the vote and becoming the first far-right party to win representation since Spain returned to democracy after Francisco Franco\u2019s death. Also among its 19 proposals were laws to \u201cprotect\u201d bullfighting, flamenco and Holy Week celebrations, and a request that Andaluc\u00eda\u2019s regional day be changed to commemorate the 1492 conclusion of the Christian reconquest of Spain seven centuries after the first Moorish armies arrived. Its leader, Santiago Abascal, has raged against what he calls \u201csupremacist feminism and gender totalitarianism\u201d, and the party has complained that existing domestic violence laws are unfairly weighted against men. Vox\u2019s rise has pushed the PP, led by Pablo Casado, further to the right. While it has abandoned its more radical demands in Andaluc\u00eda, the upstart party has now further revealed its ability to shape the political debate and win symbolic concessions from the mainstream right. The EU and the French government both expressed concerns this week over the rhetoric and manoeuvrings since December\u2019s election. The European commission\u2019s chief spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, declined to comment on the formation of the regional government, but said: \u201cFor us, fundamental rights, parity, and equality between men and women remain an absolute political priority.\u201d France\u2019s minister for European affairs, Nathalie Loiseau, was more explicit. Although France\u2019s governing party, La R\u00e9publique En Marche, is aligned with the Citizens party, Loiseau warned against striking any deals with Vox. \u201cAs a member of a government and a party \u2026 that defeated the far-right to win a general election, you\u2019ll understand why I say that there can be no deals with the far-right,\u201d she told the Spanish radio network Cadena Ser on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to the initial statement from Vox representatives, saying they want to set back women\u2019s rights. They are very worrying and I think everything possible must be done to fight this extremism.\u201d The socialist government of Spanish prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said it regretted what it termed \u201cthe radicalisation of the PP and Citizens following their deal with the far-right\u201d. It took particular aim at the latter party, accusing it of of failing to heed the warnings of other European parties, adding: \u201cCitizens has made Vox a principal actor in the government of the people of Andaluc\u00eda. In the face of this drift towards sexism and xenophobia, the government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez will focus on improving the present and preparing Spain for the future \u2013 even if others insist on looking back towards the past.\u201d Women\u2019s rights groups across Spain are planning action over the coming weeks to safeguard existing legislation and to protest against Vox\u2019s demands.",

Viscount Hailsham originally tabled an amendment dealing with this when the bill was in the Lords, there were further changes when the legislation returned to the Commons, but MPs settled on a complicated condition saying that, if the motion approving the deal gets voted down, the government must make a statement on what will happen next within 21 calendar days, and then allow a vote in the Commons within seven sitting days.</p> <p>There was then a row about whether that vote would be on a motion that could be amended. As a result of an amendment proposed by Dominic Grieve in December, and passed by MPs, that motion will be amendable. In other words, MPs will be able to put forward their alternative \u2018plan B\u2019. (Or, I suppose, if the government proposes \u2018plan B\u2019 in its motion, MPs can table amendments with \u2018plan C\u2019 etc.)</p> <p>Today\u2019s amendment just accelerates that process.

There will \u201cnot be any delay\u201d, he said. He said that the UK has said that it will not impose new checks on lorries entering the country in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and at Calais the same policy would apply. There would be no new inspections, other than the ones already in force for migrants. \u201cThe only thing that we will be asking [of drivers is] that they have their customs declarations,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Puissesseau conceded that there would have to be veterinary and phytosanitary inspections. But he said the ports were already building infrastructure for this.</p> <p>And he took a swipe at Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, saying that it was a \u201cshock\u201d for Calais to learn that the government was getting ready to spend an extra \u00a3100m ferry capacity in case the port could not cope. He went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is disrespectful to Calais and to Dover what has been decided by Mr Grayling and the British government ... This \u00a3100m - if Great Britain has too much money, they should give it to us, to help us to be more effective towards the migrants.</p> </blockquote> <p>But later on the same programme <strong>David Lidington</strong>, the Cabinet Office minister, disputed Puissesseau\u2019s analysis. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I understand your interviewee wanting to talk up the prospects of the port he represents, but, for example, European law says all food exports and livestock exports from a third country to the EU have to be inspected, 100% checked, at a designated border post. Those don\u2019t exist at Calais or Coquelles rail terminal, which is where our livestock and food exports go through to the continent at the moment.

It is simply not possible to suggest that by saying that I will not countenance no deal, I am breaking that manifesto commitment.

Here\u2019s a summary of the latest events: MPs voted to force Theresa May to present a new Brexit plan within three days if her current proposal is rejected next week. Amid chaotic scenes, the Speaker was criticised by Tory Brexiters for allowing the procedural amendment, effectively obliging the government to offer an alternative plan if the current proposal is voted down, as is expected by many. John Bercow also suggested changes to Commons procedures that could significantly weaken the authority of the executive, effectively conceding that he was going against precedent by saying that precedent should sometimes be ignored, since otherwise \u201cmanifestly nothing .. would ever change\u201d. Theresa May hosted a drinks reception for backbench MPs at Downing Street as she continued her charm offensive ahead of the vote on her Brexit deal on Tuesday. Emerging from 10 Downing Street this evening, Jacob Rees-Mogg denied he wanted a hard Brexit. \u201cI\u2019m all in favour of getting a deal, I just don\u2019t like the deal that\u2019s on offer at the moment,\u201d he told reporters. Labour MP and Mother of the House Harriet Harman called for a Westminster conference to tackle the abuse of politicians as soon as possible after Tory MP Anna Soubry was harassed as she attempted to enter Parliament this week. Hugo Swire, the Tory MP whose amendment means that the government has accepted six new conditions related to the backstop, reportedly conceded that it cannot override the withdrawal agreement. Sources close to the European Research Group have told the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuennsberg that the amendment may cause a small number of rebels to support the government, \u201cbut it is not a game changer\u201d. It emerged that the government quietly awarded a number of leading global consultancy firms with Brexit-related contracted, Sky News reported. The Democratic Unionist party branded the government\u2019s pledge over the Northern Irish backstop as \u201ccosmetic and meaningless\u201d. The Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay announced that the government shall accept an amendment from a government loyalist to its Brexit motion involving six \u201cconcessions\u201d. However, the plans were roundly dismissed as insignificant and undeliverable. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said he does not think Brexit can happen by 29 March and that extending article 50 \u201cmay well be inevitable\u201d. Two of his shadow cabinet colleagues also said Labour will almost immediately table a no confidence motion in the government if it loses Tuesday\u2019s vote. Thanks for reading this live blog. For those looking to read more, Guardian political correspondent Jessica Elgot has this report on John Bercow. The EU withdrawal agreement debate is still chugging along, presided over by the Speaker John Bercow. Liberal Democrat MP Jo Swinson has renewed calls for a People\u2019s Vote - an increasingly popular option within the House of Commons, and one which this newspaper supports \u2013 applauding members of Parliament for \u201ccoming together beyond party lines to push for the public to have a final say on the deal\u201d. She restated that the UK\u2019s interests are best served within the European Union, criticising the fact that \u201cthe energy of parliament has been sucked into the black hole of Brexit\u201d, and stressing that leaving the EU will not enrich the UK \u2013 contrary to \u201cthe fantasies of the leave campaign.\u201d Labour MP Chris Elmore also said he will not vote for the deal since he \u201cwill not vote for my constituents to be poorer\u201d. Labour MP Pat McFadden said there have been no substantial changes to the proposals presented to MPs today, and that the agreement\u2019s flaws go far beyond just the Northern Ireland backstop. Owen Smith, the former Labour party leader candidate, has said that the proposed deal will make people poorer and will in fact cede sovereignty to the EU. \u201cA deeply ironic state of affairs, not what was promised\u201d he says, adding that the UK is increasingly becoming a \u201claughing stock\u201d around the world. Tory MP Julian Knight said that despite being \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the backstop, he now supports the withdrawal agreement. Harriet Harman and Ken Clarke are to call for a Westminster conference to tackle the abuse of politicians after Tory MP Anna Soubry was harassed as she attempted to enter Parliament this week. The Mother of the House, Harman, said she wanted the conference to happen \u201cimmediately\u201d and said it should not have to wait until after the UK is scheduled to leave the EU on March 29, adding that there has been an upswing in abuse against all MPs since Brexit. \u201cAre all MPs expected to be as fearless as Anna Soubry?\u201d said Harman, adding there had been \u201ctoo much hand-wringing\u201d but no action to tackle the problem. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to drift into a situation where is does actually become dangerous to be an MP or you\u2019ve got to risk danger, but we have to get the balance right, nobody wants MPs to be feather-bedded. \u201cWe don\u2019t want MPs who are looking over their shoulder, who are keeping their heads down, not holding open surgeries, who don\u2019t travel on their own because they don\u2019t want to come back late at night, this is all actually happening.\u201d The MP for Camberwell and Peckham spoke of how she had received death threats but didn\u2019t report it for years because \u201cI didn\u2019t want to look like a victim or that I couldn\u2019t stand up for myself\u201d. Harman said the Speaker John Bercow was keen to support the conference, and that she hopes organisation can begin from next week. Owen Jones, the Guardian columnist, tweeted earlier: Anti-Brexit campaigners warned backbench MPs as they arrived at Downing Street for a drinks reception tonight that voting for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal will lead to \u201cthe mother of all hangovers\u201d. It is the second such event so far this week as May seeks to gain support for her proposed deal more informal settings than the Commons ahead of the withdrawal agreement vote on Tuesday. Jacob Rees-Mogg, chair of the influential European Research Group, was among those in attendance, with much resting on whether May can depend on the support of the arch-Brexiteers within her party. The Guardian\u2019s political editor Heather Stewart has taken stock of what the PM has left to offer her MP\u2019s: very little. Kevin Schofield, Politics Home editor, tweets: Seven former Speakers of the House of Commons have been executed, writes John Crace, the Guardian\u2019s parliamentary sketch writer. To judge by the looks on the faces of many on the government benches, John Bercow came dangerously close to becoming the eighth. Nicholas Watt, BBC Newsnight\u2019s political editor, tweets that Tory MP and government loyalist Hugo Swire has admitted his amendment cannot override the withdrawal agreement. Swire\u2019s amendment means that the government would accept six new conditions relating to the backstop. However, these have been dismissed by an expert as mostly meaningless or undeliverable; while Jacob Rees-Mogg has said the Swire amendment would, in an case, by \u201ctrumped by the withdrawal agreement\u201d. Sources close to the European Research Group have told the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuennsberg that the amendment may cause a small number of rebels to support the government, \u201cbut it is not a game changer\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s associate editor Martin Kettle writes that John Bercow bravely and corrected allowed for a vote on the Grieve amendment, empowering parliament against the government on Brexit at a pivotal moment. John Bercow can sometimes seem to be auditioning to play Shakespeare\u2019s Malvolio. The House of Commons Speaker has at times a comic degree of self-esteem that is the equal of the arrogant steward in Twelfth Night. Like Malvolio, Bercow can also drive colleagues to distraction, as he did today. Today, though, Bercow took a brave stand to empower Britain\u2019s parliament against Britain\u2019s government on Brexit. And that qualifies him to be considered the most radical holder of his office in generations. Like Malvolio, a version of greatness has been thrust upon him. The vast majority of people are understandably not well versed in Commons procedure. So it may seem strange to claim that a decision to allow an amendment to be moved on a Commons timetable motion \u2013 and with no debate \u2013 is in any way immense. Nevertheless, Bercow\u2019s decision to allow the all-party effort, led by the Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve, to tie the government\u2019s hands \u2013 it must come back with a plan B within three days if the Brexit deal is defeated next week \u2013 deserves such accolades. Steve Bell\u2019s cartoon on events today in Parliament: Parliament is biased towards Remain and is \u201cdoing everything in its power\u201d to obstruct the Leave votes of 17.4 million, claims the pro-Brexit group Change Britain. After MP\u2019s today voted to force Theresa May to promptly present them with a new Brexit plan if her current proposal is voted down \u2013 sparking chaos and accusations that the Speaker John Bercow exhibited partiality in allowing Dominic Grieve, the Tory MP that supports a second referendum, to make the initial amendment \u2013 the Change Britain chair Gisela Stewart said: This Remain Parliament is doing everything in its power to obstruct the Leave votes of 17.4 million. Voters quite rightly expected their politicians to respect the result of the referendum and implement it accordingly. But pro-EU MPs seeking to use every parliamentary trick in the book to block Brexit are simply damaging the public\u2019s trust in democracy. \u2018People voted to take back control as they felt politicians had failed to listen to their concerns for years. The actions of Remain MPs today suggest they have no intention of changing this any time soon. The government has awarded a number of leading global consultancy firms with Brexit-related contracts worth \u00a375m, it has emerged. Sky News reports that the deals were brokered in April and had not been widely announced, with details of the plans discreetly published on a government website just before Christmas, eight months later. In contrast to a certain start-up ferry company, all of the companies involved are well-known \u2013 including Deloitte, Accenture, PwC, Bain, McKinsey and Boston Consulting. Each company received a contract for \u201cthe supply of Cabinet Office consultancy support for EU Exit\u201d worth between \u00a35m and \u00a310m, according to the report. Rushanara Ali, the Labour MP, has just delivered a speech stating that she will not be supporting the government\u2019s deal. Following the dramatic events in the House of Commons today, she sums up a feeling likely to be shared among MPs from all parties. \u201c[Theresa May] is holding a metaphorical gun, Mr Speaker, to our heads, by giving us this false choice between her deal and no deal. It is utterly irresponsible and she .. and her ministers need to stop doing that. We will not accept this false choice.\u201d The MP for Bethnal Green &amp; Bow quotes figures released by the Bank of England that warned a no-deal Brexit could shrink the UK economy by 8%, with unemployment rising as inflation spiralled out of control. This would be \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d she says. \u201cMy constituency will be among the worst off, as will be many other constituencies in terms of job losses under a no deal situation.\u201d According to the UK Trade Policy Observatory and the University of Sussex, thousands of people in her constituency would lose their jobs. \u201cThere is no majority for crashing out of the EU with no deal,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd yesterday\u2019s amendment to the finance bill demonstrates that. I believe that there is a majority Mr Speaker, in seeking to secure a permanent customs union and single market access, and the government should be seeking to do that. And as the government is running down the clock, article 50 must be revoked. But of course, the best deal we have on offer is membership of the EU. The government promised the exact same benefits and they now offer something that is going to be damaging to our economy. Theresa May will be obliged to present MPs with a new Brexit plan within three days if her current proposal is voted down next week, after a procedural amendment to the plan\u2019s progress through the Commons was passed amid chaotic scenes. John Bercow has infuriated Tory Brexiters by allowing MPs to vote on Dominic Grieve\u2019s procedural amendment. Bercow also floated the possibility of changing Commons procedure in a way that could weaken the authority of the executive very significantly. He allowed the vote despite being advised by clerks that the amendment was inadmissable. When challenged about this in a rowdy, hour-long series of points of order, Bercow effectively admitted he was going against precedent by saying that sometimes precedent should be ignored. He told MPs: To some of the concerns that have been expressed, I understand the importance of precedent, but precedent does not completely bind, for one very simple reason ... If we were guided only by precedent, manifestly nothing in our procedures would ever change. Things do change. I have made an honest judgment. Bercow also, in response to a question from Iain Duncan Smith, implied that in future he might regularly interpret the rules in such a way as to make it easier for opposition or backbench MPs to try to amend business motions. In theory, this could could make it much harder for a government to get its business through the Common - although in practice it is always possible for a government with a majority to change Commons rules closing loopholes of this kind. This Twitter thread, by the former Tory aide Chris White, contains a a good summary of the issue. The BBC\u2019s Mark D\u2019Arcy also has a good summary here. He concludes: I don\u2019t want to delve too deeply into the arcana of business of the House motions only amendable by ministers of the crown, but this drove a coach and horses through accepted normal practice, and will have huge implications for the course of Brexit. The decisions will come much faster, and potentially, those plotting an alternative course to the PM\u2019s would have more space in which to work. And it may also set a sweeping precedent allowing MPs far more grip over their debates, on Brexit and pretty much anything else. If such a precedent can be made to stick, it would be a huge blow against any government\u2019s accustomed control over the business of the Commons. This is the biggest thing the speaker has done, or is likely to do, easily eclipsing his decision to allow an extra amendment to the 2013 Queens\u2019 Speech, kicking off the Commons campaign which ultimately led to an EU referendum becoming official Conservative policy. Theresa May\u2019s attempts to woo the Democratic Unionist party with a pledge over the contentious backstop have failed after the party branded the proposals as \u201ccosmetic and meaningless\u201d. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has announced that the government is accepting an amendment to its Brexit motion involving six \u201cconcessions\u201d that would supposedly give MPs more say over the introduction of the backstop and make the deal conditional on Brussels offering \u201cfurther assurance\u201d. (See 3.22pm.) But one expert has dismissed them as mostly meaningless or undeliverable. (See 4pm.) And Steve Baker, a leading Brexiter MP, has dismissed the amendment as \u201cflimsy rubbish\u201d. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has said that he does not think Brexit can happen by 29 March and that extending article 50 \u201cmay well be inevitable\u201d. (See 3.52pm and 5.02pm.) Two of his shadow cabinet colleagues have also said that Jeremy Corbyn will table a no confidence motion in the government almost immediately if May loses the Brexit vote next Tuesday. (See 10.05am.) The Conservative MP Craig Mackinlay, who was accused of spending twice the legal limit in election expenses to beat the then Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, has been cleared. That\u2019s all from me. My colleague Mattha Busby is now taking over. Here are three articles worth reading about John Bercow\u2019s procedural ruling today. Anne Perkins at the Guardian says Bercow is endangering his office. The real point about Bercow\u2019s actions is the furious accusations of party bias that it has provoked from his critics. \u201cThe political impartiality of the Speaker is a key feature of the office, while the role\u2019s authority has developed over time alongside other procedural reforms\u201d intones the Commons guide to the office of Speaker. It\u2019s one thing to stand up for backbenchers against a powerful executive. It\u2019s quite another to use the office to advance a political cause. In the end, the judgment will rest on whether the failure of government and parliament as a whole to find any grounds for agreement on Brexit legitimises intervention on one side by the Speaker \u2013 or whether instead it marks a wanton disregard for the rule of law. Everyone knows where unchecked law-breaking can lead. The Speaker takes a grave risk when he appears to ignore the rules. At the least, it makes it harder to insist the government observes the rules next time. Steven Swinford at the Telegraph (paywall) says John Bercow was \u201clivid\u201d when the clerks told him he should not accept the Grieve amendment. Sir David Natzler, the Clerk of the Commons and the authority on parliamentary procedure, advised Mr Bercow on Wednesday morning that the Grieve amendment \u201cshould not be touched\u201d because it went against the \u201cstanding orders of the House\u201d. Mr Bercow was told twice by the clerks that the amendment should not be accepted. However a source said he was \u201clivid\u201d and refused to accept their advice, referring to them as a \u201cgaggle\u201d. After overruling Sir David, Bercow went ahead and selected the amendment before heading directly for the Chamber. Shortly before prime minister\u2019s questions Julian Smith, the chief whip, approached Mr Bercow in the Speaker\u2019s chair to challenge his decision. Allowing the amendment to be tabled, he argued, would damage parliament. He was dismissed by Mr Bercow, who was overheard saying as Mr Smith returned to the Tory benches that he wouldn\u2019t be \u201cbullied\u201d by Conservative whips. Isabel Hardman at the Spectator says Bercow\u2019s conduct is a serious constitutional issue. Today Speaker Bercow told the House of Commons that he could disregard precedent and change procedure as he wished, while admitting that he hadn\u2019t fully thought through the implications of this. The reason, for those who are understandably befuddled by this row, that there were so many points of order is that Bercow had decided to accept an amendment to the business motion for today\u2019s Brexit debate which would give May just three days to return to the Commons with new plans if her Brexit deal fails to pass next week\u2019s meaningful vote. It has been reported that Bercow was advised by the clerks that such an amendment was not in line with Commons procedure, and Bercow as good as admitted that today, telling Jacob Rees-Mogg that he would reflect on the points that he had made. This shows that the Speaker has not thought through the precedent that his own actions would set. On the subject of delaying article 50 (see 5.02pm), it is worth quoting in detail what Theresa May said about this at PMQs in response to a question from the Tory Brexiter Julian Lewis. Lewis said: According to that invaluable website TheyWorkForYou, the prime minister has assured the House on no fewer than 74 previous occasions that we will be leaving the EU on 29 March. Will she categorically confirm today that there is absolutely no question at all of delaying that date? And May replied: I am happy to repeat what I have said previously\u2014that we will be leaving the European Union on 29 March. I want us to leave the European Union on 29 March with the good deal that is on the table. You\u2019ll notice that May did not give Lewis the absolute assurance that he wanted. This is not the first time May or one of her ministers has said something implying an extending article 50 is now being seen as a possible option, although Number 10 has said publicly that this will not happen. According to the Telegraph\u2019s Jack Maidment, 17 Tory MPs rebelled against the government and voted for the Grieve amendment. Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby says she has been told Jeremy Corbyn will call for an extension of article 50 in a big Brexit speech he is giving tomorrow morning. She also says that someone else has told her not to expect that (although it is not unusual for parties, when they plan to make news with a particular announcement, to discourage journalists from reporting it too early). In the Commons earlier Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said that he did not think it would be possible to leave the EU on 29 March. (See 3.52pm.) He also said extending article 50 \u201cmay well be inevitable\u201d. At various points in the Brexit saga Labour has called for things which the government has subsequently adopted. Starmer (as he reminded MPs in the debate today) first demanded a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d, which has now more or less been conceded (depending on how you define it). Labour also said the UK should offer a unilateral guarantee that EU nationals living in the UK will retain the right to stay whatever happens, which the government for a long time resisted, but eventually accepted. Labour called for a transition period and, after delaying, the government did accept that that would be necessary. And then Labour called for a permanent customs union with the EU, which is similar to what is implied by the Chequers plan and the political declaration, even though the government insists that technically the UK would not be a member. Andrew Mitchell, the Tory former chief whip and former international development secretary, is speaking now. He says he does not often speak on Brexit. But he is intervening to say he is opposed to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. It is \u201cthe worst common denominator\u201d. It will satisfy neither leavers nor remainers. George Osborne, the Conservative former chancellor and a pro-European, has backed John Bercow in his decision earlier to accept the Grieve amendment. Starmer says a no-deal Brexit is \u201cpractically not viable\u201d by 29 March. He has visited Dover and is aware of all the problems there would be, he says. He says Labour would fight a no-deal Brexit \u201ctooth and nail\u201d. Not having a deal acceptable to MPs is a \u201ctragic waste\u201d of the last two years, he says. He says after the vote on Tuesday next week the house will have to decide what it wants to do next. Back in the debate Starmer says Tory MPs now say it was always obvious that the political declaration on the future relationship would be relatively vague at this point. But in her Lancaster House speech in January 2017, May said that by the time the UK left the EU, she wanted to have reached an agreement about the future partnership. She then wanted \u201ca phased process of implementation\u201d. Starmer says he argued at the time that there would have to be a transition. But May said it would be an \u201cimplementation period\u201d \u2013 implying the future arrangement would already been agreed. He says this shows why what May is offering is a blind Brexit. And he says no one in the EU thinks that the negotiation on the future will be over by December 2020, he says. Simon Usherwood, deputy director of UK in a Changing EU, an academic-led research project, has posted a Twitter thread assessing the six concessions announced by Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, earlier. (See 3.22pm.) He is not impressed. The thread starts here. Starmer turns to the political declaration on the future relationship. He quotes from the paper, which talks about \u201ca spectrum of different outcomes\u201d. It is not a deal, he says. It is just \u201can options paper\u201d. Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, tries again. If there were a cross-party move to keep the UK in the customs union for good, would Labour support that? Starmer says he has been willing to discuss this with other MPs. And there will have to be a discussion after next Tuesday, he says. He says he does not think the UK will be able to leave the EU on 29 March. So MPs are going to have to discuss alternative options. I actually genuinely think we can\u2019t do it on 29 March this year. It\u2019s simply not viable, for so many practical reasons. We\u2019re going to have to look at what are the available options that realistically are still on the table. But some of the options that were available a year ago won\u2019t be available now, at least in the same form. Starmer says he thinks Brexit will have to be delayed. Sir Oliver Letwin tries again. If there were a cross-party agreement on staying in a customs union, and a single market deal, on the basis of Norway or otherwise, would Labour cooperate with the government on a deal, so that the UK could leave on 29 March with a deal? Starmer says there are other issues too. But if the UK is to leave with a deal, then there will have to be a consensus on something. He says at no point has the government reached out to Labour, even after the snap election. At some point he thought they might give him a ring, and ask what Labour wanted. He says the government instead has just whipped against opposition amendments, regardless of whether they were good amendments or bad amendments. Sir Oliver Letwin, the Conservative former cabinet minister, intervenes. He says Labour says it wants \u201ca permanent UK-EU customs union and a strong single market deal\u201d. Letwin says he is speaking as someone who hopes that there will be a cross-party agreement on Brexit. Can Starmer explain what that means? Starmer says he is interested in something that would be similar to the customs union, but not the same. He says he would like to explore this in talks with the EU. If it was a custom union like the one Turkey has with the EU, that would not be acceptable. And he says he would like something akin to single market membership, but not EEA membership. He accepts that these are issues that would have to be negotiated. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is speaking in the debate now. He says the government pulled the vote before Christmas because it accepted it needed to get changes to make it acceptable to MPs. He says that Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, even said that, without changes, the cabinet might not support taking the deal back to the Commons. But, Starmer says, MPs are resuming the debate without the government having secured any changes. In the Commons debate Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has just told MPs that the government will accept an amendment to the Brexit motion tabled by the Conservative MP Sir Hugo Swire. This means the government would accept six new conditions relating to the backstop. Here they are in detail: Parliament would only be backing the withdrawal agreement subject to \u201cthe government obtaining further assurance from the European Union that the Northern Ireland backstop would only be a temporary arrangement and that, in the event that it comes into force, both parties intend to agree a future relationship or alternative arrangements consistent with the political declaration one year after the end of the implementation period.\u201d Parliament would have to approve any decision to implement the backstop. If the backstop did get implemented, the government would have \u201ca duty to have an agreed future relationship or alternative arrangements one year after the Northern Ireland backstop coming into force, consistent with the framework for the future relationship ... so that the Northern Ireland backstop ceases to apply.\u201d If the backstop were deemed necessary, MPs would get to decide whether to implement it, or whether to extend the transition as an alternative. The government would have to report in March 2020 on what was being done to ensure the backstop was not needed. The government would have to consult the devolved administrations, in particular the Northern Ireland executive and assembly. You can read the full text of the Swire amendment on the order paper here (pdf). Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory MP who chairs the European Research Group, which represents hardline Brexiters, is playing down the impact of the vote on the Grieve amendment. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, is now opening the debate on the Brexit deal. In his speech he is restating the government\u2019s case, but (at least so far) he has not had anything new to announce. The EU (Withdrawal) Act sets out what must happen if MPs vote down Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. Viscount Hailsham originally tabled an amendment dealing with this when the bill was in the Lords, there were further changes when the legislation returned to the Commons, but MPs settled on a complicated condition saying that, if the motion approving the deal gets voted down, the government must make a statement on what will happen next within 21 calendar days, and then allow a vote in the Commons within seven sitting days. There was then a row about whether that vote would be on a motion that could be amended. As a result of an amendment proposed by Dominic Grieve in December, and passed by MPs, that motion will be amendable. In other words, MPs will be able to put forward their alternative \u2018plan B\u2019. (Or, I suppose, if the government proposes \u2018plan B\u2019 in its motion, MPs can table amendments with \u2018plan C\u2019 etc.) Today\u2019s amendment just accelerates that process. If May loses the vote on Tuesday, she will have to hold the \u2018plan B\u2019 vote within three sitting days \u2013 ie by Monday week. Arguably the government would have moved forward quickly anyway. That is what Downing Street is saying now. (See 2.06pm.) But although Theresa May was probably planning a statement to the Commons soon after any potential defeat on Tuesday (ie, she would not have waited 21 days anyway), there is no evidence that she was planning a vote anytime soon. Given her reluctance generally to allow MPs a say on this process, it is likely that she would have delayed that vote \u2013 not least because that might have given her a few weeks to secure extra concessions from Brussels. Now, at most, she will have six days to extract meaningful concessions from Brussels. The passing of the Grieve amendment just now will probably prevent prolonged haggling with the EU about May\u2019s deal, and hasten the moment when the Commons and the government have to contemplate an alternative approach. Quite what might happen at that point, though, remains anyone\u2019s guess ... The government has lost. MPs have voted by 308 votes to 297 \u2013 a majority of 11 \u2013 to force the PM to hold a \u201cplan B\u201d vote on what happens next within three days if she loses the Brexit vote on Tuesday next week. MPs are now voting on the Grieve amendment. (See 9.05am.) For the record, this is what it says. At end, add \u201c7. In the event of the motion under section 13(1)(b) being negatived or amended so as to be negatived, a minister of the crown shall table within three sitting days a motion under section 13, considering the process of exiting the European Union under article 50.\u201d Downing Street has made clear that if next week\u2019s vote is lost, the prime minister would come back to the House of Commons and set out her plans well before the 21-day time-limit set out in the withdrawal act. \u201cWe would seek to provide certainty, quickly,\u201d a government spokesman said, speaking to journalists after PMQs. He also insisted the government had received clear advice that suggested the motion was not amendable. We are surprised the government amendment was selected; the advice we received was that it would not be in order. Asked whether that advice was from Commons clerks \u2013 amid reports John Bercow personally overruled them \u2013 he added: \u201cWe have access to the resources of the House of Commons as well as our own.\u201d Asked about the role of Bercow, he said: \u201cThe Speaker\u2019s impartiality is a matter for the house.\u201d The Commons is now hearing a 10-minute rule bill, from the Conservative Leo Docherty. We\u2019re expecting the vote on the Grieve amendment (see 9.05am) shortly. Adam Holloway, a Conservative, says there is an anti-Brexit sticker on Bercow\u2019s car. He says MPs have seen. This casts doubt on Bercow\u2019s impartiality, he says. Bercow says Holloway is wrong. That sticker is on his wife\u2019s car, he says. And he says he is sure Holloway is not suggesting a wife is the property or chattel of her husband. A wife is entitled to her own views. Some MPs applaud Bercow for this. Crispin Blunt, a Tory, says Bercow originally said he would only serve nine years. He has also been the subject of bullying allegations, Blunt suggests. (He refers to the Laura Cox report.) And he says Blunt has expressed his views on Brexit (he backed remain). Blunt goes on: For many of we will now have the unshakeable conviction that the referee of our affairs ... is no longer neutral. Bercow says he has always championed the right of MPs to express their views, particularly on Brexit. And he says he has always been \u201cscrupulously fair\u201d to remainers and leavers. He says he was elected as speaker to serve for this parliament. If he has a statement to make on this, he will make it to MPs. Bercow says it is not his job to push through a particular policy. It is simply his job to facilitate allowing the House of Commons to take its own decisions. That is what he is doing, and that approach should apply to Brexit too, he says. Here are some tweets from opposition MPs applauding Bercow for his stance. From Labour\u2019s Ben Bradshaw From Plaid Cymru\u2019s Jonathan Edwards From Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary From Labour\u2019s Mary Creagh From Labour\u2019s Chuka Umunna From the Evening Standard\u2019s Joe Murphy James Cleverly, a Conservative, says it is important for Bercow to be impartial, and to be seen to be impartial. He says it might have been wise not to take this decision, setting a new precedent, at such a contentious time. Bercow says the responsibility is his. He has to take a decision now. And he is using his best judgment. He believes he is right, he says. Bercow makes a similar point in response to another point of order. My job is not to be a cheerleader for the executive branch. My job is to stand up for the rights of the House of Commons. And the Speaker will assuredly do so. Asked by a Tory if he should consult his deputy speakers about this decision, Bercow says he won\u2019t. He says he was elected to take these decisions. He won\u2019t duck his responsibilities, he says. Here is some Twitter comment on the Bercow row. From Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt From the Institute for Government\u2019s Catherine Haddon From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg From the Evening Standard\u2019s Joe Murphy From PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter, asks Bercow if he can confirm that the motion, as amended, would have to be put by a member of the government. And he asks for a ruling on the meaning of the word \u201cforthwith\u201d. Erskine May (the Commons procedural Bible) says motions of the kind being debated today must be put to a vote \u201cforthwith\u201d. But Erskine May specifies \u201cforthwith\u201d in other circumstances. So does Bercow\u2019s ruling affect those circumstances too. Bercow says he will reflect on the second point. On the first point, if a motion has been moved, it must be put to a vote. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, says the House of Commons is now taking back control. That is to be welcomed, he says. He says it is time to move on to the vote. Bercow says he would like to move on, but he will treat colleagues with courtesy, and take a few more points of order. Simon Hoare, a Conservative, says Bercow risks undermining the dignity of his post. He says we are in \u201cchoppy waters\u201d. Bercow says he is \u201cdeeply grateful\u201d. (He is not concealing his sarcasm very successfully.) He says he will reflect on what Hoare said. Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory Brexiter, says over the last 25 years or so he has repeatedly been told business motions cannot be amended. Allowing them to be amended has huge implications. It will affect how the government gets its business through the Commons. Will Bercow tell the clerks that in future backbenchers will be able to amend business motions? Bercow says he will reflect on this. But he does not think it is unreasonable for backbenchers to seek to amend business motions. He says he does understand the importance of precedent. But precedent does not completely bind. If we were guided only by precedent, manifestly nothing in our procedures would ever change. Bercow hints he may routinely allow business motions to be amended by backbenchers. As Duncan Smith said, this potentially has huge consequences. By and large, the government controls the business in the Commons; it decides what gets debated and when, etc. If the Commons as a whole gets to take these decisions, particularly in a parliament where the government does not have a majority, then the executive will have been significantly weakened. Leadsom rises again. Did the clerk say Bercow\u2019s plan was acceptable? Or did he advise against it? Bercow says the clerk offered him advice. They discussed it. When Bercow took his decision, the clerk offered further advice. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, asks Bercow whether the clerk of the Commons supported his decision. Will he publish the advice he received from the clerk? There is loud cheering from Tory MPs for this. Bercow says the advice he gets from the clerks is given to him in private. But he says he also had a written note from the clerk, which he quoted from in his response to the first point of order. Heidi Allen, a Conservative pro-European, says she is \u201chopping mad\u201d. We are 79 days from Brexit, she says. She says MPs should be getting on with debating a plan B for Brexit. The Labour MP Stephen Doughty says the government does not want the Commons to have a say on Brexit. He says members of the public watching cannot see Julian Smith, the chief whip, texting journalists. He criticises the government for tabling the business of the house motion very late yesterday. Bercow says MPs can decide for themselves whether it was helpful for the motion to be tabled when it was. Labour\u2019s Alison McGovern asks Bercow whether he agrees that, if MPs disagree with the amendment, they can just vote against it. Bercow says he agrees. Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, says he is surprised MPs are against MPs being given a vote. He suggests some of his Brexiter colleagues should join the yellow jacket brigade outside the Commons. Mark Francois, a Tory Brexiter, says he has a copy of the original business motion. It said no motion to vary or supplement the provisions of the motion could be made except by a minister of the crown (ie, it said only a minister could amend the business motion for the Brexit debate). He says this is a motion passed by the house. He says in his 18 years as an MP he has never seen a Speaker override a motion of the house. He has heard Bercow say many times before that he cannot override a motion of the house. So why is he doing that today? Bercow says the business motion said no motion could be moved other than by a minister of the crown. But we are not talking about a motion, he says; we are talking about an amendment. There is loud jeering in the chamber soon. Very loudly, someone says: \u201cSorry, that is absolute [word indistinct].\u201d Eddie Hughes, a Conservative, goes next with a point of order. He asks Bercow to cite the precedent for amendments being allowed to a business motion like the one on the order paper today (which MPs had assumed to be unamendable). Bercow says he is not obliged to cite precedent. But he is clear in his mind that the motion can be amended. The business motion allows no debate. But it does not say no amendment is allowed, he says. MPs are now dealing with points of order. Peter Bone, the Tory Brexiter, says he was told by the clerks yesterday that he could not table an amendment to the business motion. But an amendment tabled by Dominic Grieve has been allowed. John Bercow, the Speaker, says he does not know why Bone was told the motion could not be amended. All I know is that in my understanding the motion is amendable. I\u2019m clear in my mind about that. Bercow says, if he had known Bone wanted to table an amendment, he would have supported that. Julian Lewis, a Conservative, says May has told MPs on 74 occasions that the UK will leave the EU on 29 March. Can she categorically rule out delaying that? May says she is happy to say what she has said before, which is that the UK will leave on that date. Paul Scully, a Conservative, says more Londoners voted for Brexit than voted for Sadiq Khan as mayor. May says Khan should back the Brexit deal. Labour\u2019s Rachael Maskell asks what May will do differently to ensure no homeless person dies in 2019. May lists some of the measures taken by the government, and says it will put more money into mental health services. Anne Main, a Conservative, says the government should help fund the RNLI. People assume it gets government funding. May praises people who contribute to the RNLI, including the Sonning branch in her own constituency. The SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart says May\u2019s Brexit deal is \u201cas dead as the deadest dodo\u201d. Will May \u201cjust go\u201d? May says Wishart does not support implementing the referendum. And he wants to take Scotland out of the UK, even though that is not what the Scottish people want. Labour\u2019s Clive Betts says councils overspent their children\u2019s services budgets by \u00a3800m last year. That is because the number of children in care is at a record high. The money allocated by the Treasury is completely inadequate, he says. May says an extra \u00a3410m was announced at the budget. Spending on services for children has increased by \u00a31.5bn since 2010. She mentions various other measures introduced to help social services. And it is not just about money, she says. It is about how services are delivered. Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock asks whether May will give MPs a vote on \u201cCommon Market 2.0\u201d, a new term for the Norway plus proposal he favours. May says her plan will implement the results of the referendum. Huw Merriman, a Conservative, says he offered to pay the charge a constituent who is an EU national would have to pay to get settled status because he thought the government would make it free. Shouldn\u2019t it be free for all EU nationals? May says the cost of getting settled status will be less than the cost of a passport. People with a valid permanent residency permit, or with leave to remain in the UK, will not have to pay, she says. Corbyn did an effective job of highlighting the weaknesses in May\u2019s Brexit stance, but they were scrappy, low-grade exchanges, and there was more than a touch of Groundhog Day about the whole thing. It was particularly foolish for Tory MPs to jeer at Corbyn at the start, as he made a point about how MPs should be allowed to say what they want free from intimidation. Once he got into his questions, he focused entirely on Brexit and, despite May trying to re-announce something she said last year about how MPs would get a vote on whether the UK should extend the transition or implement the backstop as an alternative, she could not really conceal the fact that she has not managed to secure anything new relating to her deal from Brussels. Corbyn challenged her about whether any of her assurances would be \u201clegally binding\u201d, and his best moment came when he pointed out her conspicuous failure to address this point. May had a good retort about Corbyn\u2019s stance on no-deal planning, which has not always been crystal clear (at various times he has sounded as if he wanted more of it; at other times less), and her peroration about the inconsistencies in Labour\u2019s position worked reasonably well. But today it felt very much like a too-obvious attempt to distract attention from her own vulnerability. Corbyn says Chris Grayling is awarding millions of pounds to ferry companies with ferries that do not exist. May has achieved nothing in her renegotiation. If her deal is rejected next week, will May call a general election? No, says May. She says she has put a good deal on the table. She says she does not know what Brexit plan Labour has. Corbyn has been for and against free movement, and for and against the UK negotiating trade deals. He wanted to trigger article 50, and now he wants to stop Brexit. Corbyn says May is the first PM to lose a vote on the finance bill since the 1970s. Will May protect thousands of skilled jobs in the automotive industry and others and rule out no deal? May makes a jibe about Corbyn recognising the leadership Yvette Cooper showed. She says her deal protects jobs. It is sensible for the government to spend money preparing for no deal, particularly given Labour\u2019s stance. Corbyn says he did not hear the words \u201clegally binding\u201d in May\u2019s answer. He says no one wants no deal \u2013 \u00a34bn is being wasted on it. Will May listen to the view parliament expressed last night and rule out no deal. May says Corbyn should back her deal. She says today Corbyn is criticising no-deal spending. But on Monday he said it was \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d. Which is it? Corbyn says, if May\u2019s deal is the only one available, why wasn\u2019t it put to a vote in December. Will the changes May wants be changes to the withdrawal agreement? May says she is looking at three things: assurances relating to the deal, and measures that can be taken domestically relating to parliament and Northern Ireland. She says she has put a good deal on the table. She is looking for clarifications. Corbyn repeats his point. May says the only way to avoid no deal is to vote for her deal. Jeremy Corbyn joins May in paying tribute to Paddy Ashdown. He says they became MPs at the same time and spent a lot of time voting against the Thatcher government together. And he supports what May said about the intimidation of Anna Soubry and the Guardian journalist Owen Jones. But intimidation is wrong in the Commons, too, he says. He says he wants a safe space for political debate. Tory MPs jeer. Corbyn says they are making his point for him. Corbyn says May failed to get legally binding assurances from the EU at the December summit, and then again over the holiday. Isn\u2019t she bringing back the same deal? May agrees with what Corbyn said about intimidation. She says Corbyn should get John McDonnell to apologise for what he said about Esther McVey. She says talks with the EU are continuing. But she is also looking at what can be done domestically. Today she has published plans for Northern Ireland. And, with reference to parliament, if by the end of 2020 the new trade relationship is not in place, parliament will vote on whether to extend the transition or implement the backstop. May says MPs would vote on whether to extend transition or implement the backstop instead. Tom Pursglove, a Conservative, asks if May will back a scheme intended to stop former servicemen who go to prison from reoffending. May says the Care after Combat programme is a good one. The SNP\u2019s Drew Hendry says EU nationals in Scotland were treated to a \u201cChristmas removal threat\u201d from the Home Office. This feels less like a hostile environment, and more like a xenophobic one. May says she recognises the huge contribution made by EU nationals. They can apply for settled status. The cost is less than the cost of a passport, she says. Theresa May starts by paying tribute to Paddy Ashdown, who died last month. He served his country \u201cwith passion and distinction\u201d, she says. She condemns the threats made to the Tory MP Anna Soubry and to journalists outside the Houses of Parliament. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, has put out a lengthy statement rejecting the government\u2019s \u201cStormont lock\u201d offer. Here is an extract. We recognise that the government has been working to bring forward measures to address our long-held concerns about the backstop issue. As far back as December 2017 we have been insisting that we cannot have specific backstop arrangements being introduced over the head of the Northern Ireland assembly. Undoubtedly there are some elements of the paper that could be improved and built upon but the paper published by the government is designed to give reassurances in the context that Northern Ireland will be subject to the backstop being operational. Indeed, paragraph 43 of the paper says, \u201cThis paper has focused particularly on the role that the NI institutions will play in any scenario in which the backstop would take effect\u201d We reject the backstop and have previously, and consistently, indicated we will not support an internationally legally binding withdrawal agreement that contains its provisions. Such an international treaty supersedes and overrides any contrary domestic legal provisions. The proposal to ensure \u201ca strong role for the Northern Ireland assembly\u201d before NI specific backstop provisions are given effect is cosmetic and meaningless in that as the paper itself indicates (paragraph 14) \u201cthis would be without prejudice to our commitment to abide by our international law obligations\u201d. The assembly would not be able to override UK international legal obligations as the backstop provisions would be in the treaty. The government\u2019s assurances do not faithfully implement what was agreed and included in paragraph 50 of the joint report in December 2017. In that paragraph, the assembly was to decide whether specific arrangements were required. Consultation cannot replace the assembly determining these matters. PMQs is about to start. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question: Martin Selmayr, secretary general to the European commission and a hate-figure for Brexiters (who believe that he has encouraged the EU to adopt a hostile stance towards the UK in the Brexit talks) has denied a report claiming he has said that Northern Ireland will be the price the UK must pay for Brexit. Peter Foster, the Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor, has written a useful Twitter thread on the \u201cStormont lock\u201d plans. (See 11.46am.) It starts here. This morning, the government published its plans to allow Northern Ireland to be consulted about regulations affecting it under the Brexit backstop. The 13-page document setting out the details is here (pdf). It is being referred to as a \u201cStormont lock\u201d. Referring to it this morning in his Today programme interview, David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, said: We are publishing today a set of Northern Ireland-specific proposals that make clear the continuing place of Northern Ireland within the UK internal market and which will give the Northern Ireland assembly, when as we all hope it is reconstituted and working again, a veto over introducing any new areas of law and policy into that backstop. But the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, rejected the proposals as \u201cwindow dressing\u201d because the border backstop would still be in place. He said: The only deal which could swing the DUP round is if the backstop as it applies to the United Kingdom as a whole, or to Northern Ireland specifically, were removed from this agreement. Because otherwise the British government, when it enters negotiations in future trade arrangements, and future relationships with the EU, it is going to find that the backdrop and the background against which that has to be negotiated is we are going to stay in the customs union and the single market. Chris Heaton-Harris, a junior Brexit minister, has been giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee this morning. Not all Brexit ministers are Brexiters (in the sense of being leave voters), but Heaton-Harris is. Here are some of the key points he\u2019s been making: Heaton-Harris said there was no \u201cparliamentary route\u201d that would allow pro-EU MPs to stop the UK leaving the EU. Asked by the SNP\u2019s Peter Grant if he agreed with Theresa May that voting down her Brexit deal could lead to Brexit not happening, he replied: The legislation is set out now, and the fact that we have activated article 50, I actually still believe we will be leaving the EU on March 29 at 11pm. Is there a parliamentary route with which Brexit can be stopped? I do not believe so. He said the closure of Calais to UK goods in the event of a no-deal Brexit did not even feature in the government\u2019s \u201creasonable worst-case scenario\u201d. This is from my colleague Peter Walker. Heaton-Harris rejected a Guardian report saying 1,000 police officers from England and Scotland are being trained for deployment in Northern Ireland in case of disorder from a no-deal Brexit. This is from PoliticsHome\u2019s John Johnston. Joanna Cherry, an SNP member of the committee, said this answer was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. Heaton-Harris confirmed the government still needs to pass hundreds of items of secondary legislation before Brexit is due to happen on 29 March. This is from the Independent\u2019s Rob Merrick. Here is some snap reaction to the Bercow decision. From the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford From the Sky\u2019s Kate McCann From Nikki da Costa, who until recently was director of legislative affairs at Downing Street From Jolyon Maugham, the QC who organised the bid to get the ECJ to rule that the UK can revoke article 50 John Bercow, the speaker, will allow MPs to vote on the Grieve amendment (see 9.05am), my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. There will be no delays at Calais if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the head of the port told the Today programme. Jean-Marc Puissesseau, who is president chairman of the ports of Boulogne Calais, was invited on to say if he agreed with what David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, told the Today programme yesterday about how France was much better prepared for a no-deal than the British media have been reporting. And Puissesseau agreed. He said the ports had been preparing for a no-deal Brexit for a year. \u201cWe will be ready [on 29 March],\u201d he said. There will \u201cnot be any delay\u201d, he said. He said that the UK has said that it will not impose new checks on lorries entering the country in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and at Calais the same policy would apply. There would be no new inspections, other than the ones already in force for migrants. \u201cThe only thing that we will be asking [of drivers is] that they have their customs declarations,\u201d he said. Puissesseau conceded that there would have to be veterinary and phytosanitary inspections. But he said the ports were already building infrastructure for this. And he took a swipe at Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, saying that it was a \u201cshock\u201d for Calais to learn that the government was getting ready to spend an extra \u00a3100m ferry capacity in case the port could not cope. He went on: It is disrespectful to Calais and to Dover what has been decided by Mr Grayling and the British government ... This \u00a3100m - if Great Britain has too much money, they should give it to us, to help us to be more effective towards the migrants. But later on the same programme David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, disputed Puissesseau\u2019s analysis. He said: I understand your interviewee wanting to talk up the prospects of the port he represents, but, for example, European law says all food exports and livestock exports from a third country to the EU have to be inspected, 100% checked, at a designated border post. Those don\u2019t exist at Calais or Coquelles rail terminal, which is where our livestock and food exports go through to the continent at the moment. So there is a gap in French and EU arrangements. Lidington also said that, under a no-deal Brexit, there would be tariffs of 40% on British lamb and beef exports, and 10% on cars. Those are things that would do serious damage to employment and to living standards and to hopes of future prosperity and growth in this country. Here is my colleague Heather Stewart on whether or not John Bercow, the speaker, will allow the Greive amendment intended to allow MPs to vote on \u2018plan B\u2019 within three days if the Brexit deal is defeated. (See 9.05am.) And here is the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford on the same story. Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative former chief whip, confirmed that he would vote against Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal this morning. He told the Today programme that it was \u201chumiliating\u201d and would \u201censhrine all those divisions which have caused such trouble in Britain. He went on: It will perpetuate all the divisionism which has led us to where we are today. Jeremy Corbyn will table a motion of no confidence in the government almost immediately if Theresa May loses the Brexit vote next week, Labour is now saying. This is what Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, told the Today programme this morning. We\u2019re now talking as if it is expected that the government next Tuesday will be defeated on the most important piece of legislation that has come before parliament probably in 50 or more years, that the government has devoted two years of its time to try to negotiate, and we\u2019re now almost accepting that this will simply be defeated and voted down. Obviously, the next thing to do immediately after that is for there to be a vote of confidence in the government. Until now Labour has been rather coy about exactly when it might table a no confidence motion, with senior figures saying it is important to wait until the moment when they judge they have the best chance of winning. After Gardiner\u2019s interview one senior party source played down the idea that Gardiner was making a firm statement about a possible no confidence vote next week. But on Sky\u2019s All Out Politics after 9pm Andrew Gwynne, the shadow communities secretary and Labour\u2019s co-national campaigner coordinator, also said that Labour would table a no confidence motion soon after the Tuesday Brexit vote if Theresa May loses. Asked if he could \u201cguarantee\u201d that Labour would table a no confidence motion in those circumstances, he replied: Well, we want a general election. And the only way you can get a general election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act is to table a vote of confidence. When asked if he could guarantee this would happen, Gwynne said: In the event of Theresa May failing to get her deal through, we will be calling for a general election. And to do that, you have to table a motion of confidence. Sky\u2019s Adam Boulton asked if that meant a confidence vote would come \u201cnext week, basically\u201d if May lost the vote. Gwynne replied: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, used an interview on the Today programme this morning to accuse Brexiters of believing in \u201cfantasies\u201d. He told the programme: I don\u2019t think that the British public are served by fantasies about magical alternative deals that are somehow going to sort of spring out of a cupboard in Brussels. This deal on the table has involved some very difficult give and take on both sides and if you go around and talk to the other EU 27 governments they will say that there are elements of this that cause them some political pain, but they are very clear, in conversations I have had with them as well as their public statements, they ain\u2019t going to be going back and unpicking this for some brand new brilliant renegotiations. So, the choice that people have is this deal or it is no deal or it is, as some MPs advocate, to reverse the 2016 referendum entirely. Lidington seemed to be referring directly to David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, who used an interview on the Today programme only yesterday to claim that the EU would be willing to offer the UK an alternative Brexit deal if only the government pushed for it a bit harder. The Conservative MP and former minister Nick Boles has revealed that he received a death threat last night after voting for the amendment, that was passed, designed to limit the Treasury\u2019s tax powers in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the BBC reports. Here is an extract from Boles\u2019s short speech in the debate. Boles voted remain in the referendum, and since then has been pushing what at one stage was called the \u2018Norway for now\u2019 option, which has now morphed into \u2018Norway plus\u2019 (meaning leaving the EU, but staying in the single market and the customs union). In the debate Boles said: However, what we did not say in [the Conservative] manifesto is that no deal is better than any deal; we said no deal is better than a bad deal. I remind my honourable friends that we have a deal; it is a deal that the 27 nations of the European Union have agreed, that the prime minister, who recently won a confidence motion in the Conservative party, and her cabinet have endorsed and advocate, and that, at the last count, about 200 Conservative members, including myself, intend to support when the vote is finally put. It is simply not possible to suggest that by saying that I will not countenance no deal, I am breaking that manifesto commitment. We do not have a bad deal; we may have a deal that you, individually, do not like, but nobody can claim that we do not have a deal that it is reasonable for Conservative members to support. It is therefore reasonable for us to say that, at this late stage, with the government having prepared as woefully as they have for no deal, we will on no account countenance a no-deal Brexit. Finally, I join [Oliver Letwin] in very clearly saying this: I will vote on any motion, on any amendment, on any piece of legislation, proposed by whomsoever in this House to ensure that we leave the European Union on 20 March with a deal or not at all. The Brexit news is coming thick and fast this morning. I will post a summary of all the developments in a moment, but this may turn out to be the most important one. MPs are trying to force a vote that would mean Theresa May would have to tell parliament within three days what she will do next if she loses the vote on her Brexit deal next Tuesday. Under the EU (Withdrawal) Act, if May loses the vote on her deal, she must make a statement within 21 days, and then hold a vote within seven sitting days of that. An amendment tabled by the Tory Dominic Grieve to today\u2019s business motion would dramatically speed up that timetable, by obliging the government to stage a vote on what will happen next - ie, on \u2018plan B\u2019 - within three sitting days (ie, by Monday 21 January). It is not clear yet whether John Bercow, the speaker, will allow a vote on the Grieve amendment, but if he does, it is likely to be passed. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston has more. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: The Commons Treasury committee publishes the government\u2019s response to its report on the Brexit withdrawal agreement. 9.15am: Chris Heaton-Harris, the Brexit minister, gives evidence to the Brexit committee about no-deal planning. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. After 1pm: MPs begin their debate on the Brexit deal. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but mostly I will be focusing on Brexit, and the debate. I plan to post a summary when I finish, after 5pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

At the heart of it all is a group of Labour backbenchers \u2013 and a growing number of Conservatives \u2013 who have been campaigning for a second referendum for over a year, and who are described by one MP involved as \u201can executive in exile\u201d. Key figures such as Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie for Labour and Anna Soubry for the Conservatives meet to discuss tactics on a daily basis when parliament sits, and test and share ideas via WhatsApp. But what has changed recently is that the anti-Brexit argument has been broadened to encompass opposition to a no-deal scenario \u2013 which some see as a strategic opportunity. \u201cIt\u2019s been obvious that you can reach quite deeply into Tory ranks once you switch the argument to \u2018no\u2019 to no deal,\u201d one anti-Brexit campaigner said. Cooper\u2019s amendment to restrict spending on a no-deal Brexit won the support of 20 Conservative MPs on Tuesday, including traditional party loyalists Oliver Letwin and Sir Nicolas Soames, who had previously only ever once voted against the Conservative whip between them. There have been clear signs for weeks that while there is no majority for a second referendum, May\u2019s Brexit, or a Norway deal, there is a firm opposition to a no deal \u2013even though the possibility that the UK could walk out represents a key part of the prime minister\u2019s negotiating strategy with the European Union.

But the crucial development was, as Dromey put it, to get MPs to agree that \u201cwhatever their preferred Brexit destination, people should agree that if May\u2019s deal goes down, we cannot plunge over a no-deal cliff\u201d. It was an issue on which signatories and pressure could be amassed from the end of last year, which in turn helped generated support for Cooper\u2019s amendment. A hundred of those MPs turned up on Tuesday to voice their concerns about the risks of no deal directly to the prime minister in a meeting in the Commons. A couple of hours later MPs voted in favour of Cooper\u2019s amendment by 303 to 296. Those involved in the backbenchers\u2019 rebellion say that trust between Labour and Conservative remainers and other anti-Brexiters in parliament has been building for months, giving MPs growing confidence to test ideas, and lay the ground for amendments that can take days or more to come together \u2013 without the Tory whips office becoming aware they are about to emerge. A succession of ministerial resignations \u2013 Justine Greening, Philip Lee, Jo Johnson and Sam Gymiah \u2013 have also boosted the number of pro-remain MPs on the Tory side, with each departure coming after weeks of discussions aimed at first persuading, then at achieving maximum impact. The result, says Leslie, is that \u201cif there is one silver lining to this dire Brexit situation, it\u2019s finding increasing common cause across the centre ground of British politics. MPs are beginning to show greater independence and I hope this can help save the country from some appalling mistakes\u201d.

Not all MPs who backed the Cooper amendment want a second referendum, but the argument is that by coming out against a no deal, they will ineluctably be drawn into supporting a general election or a second referendum, given that May\u2019s deal does not appear to have the support to pass the Commons next week. According to one MP involved: \u201cAvoiding no deal would require the UK to renegotiate Brexit, which in turn would require an extension to article 50.

      "bodyText": "Chit-chat with Tory backbenchers was probably the last thing Theresa May was in the mood for after MPs voted to serve Downing Street with a three-day deadline for setting out a Brexit plan B. But the prime minister hosted a Downing Street drinks party with colleagues on Wednesday night as part of a last-ditch charm offensive before next week\u2019s vote in parliament, which even close allies admit she looks set to lose by a significant margin. One guest was the author of her latest misfortune \u2013 her Oxford contemporary and old friend Dominic Grieve, whose amendment has further narrowed her room for manoeuvre in the next few febrile days. In one sense, the angry clashes at Westminster on Wednesday, and the second defeat for the government in two days, changed little. While, formally, the EU withdrawal act gave the government 21 days to return to the Commons if the vote were lost \u2013 to set out what it plans to do next \u2013 there would have been intense political pressure to do so sooner. May had already reassured cabinet ministers that she would act more swiftly than that, and a government spokesman said on Wednesday: \u201cWe would seek to provide certainty, quickly.\u201d Grieve\u2019s amendment gives the UK prime minister a hard deadline, and underlines rebel backbenchers\u2019 determination to use every tactic at their disposal to bind her hands. But almost as significant was the row that led to its passage, with the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, facing down his own clerks, May\u2019s chief whip and the leader of the House of Commons, and insisting Grieve\u2019s amendment could be voted on. One pro-EU Tory said of Bercow: \u201cHe was brilliant today, utterly brilliant.\u201d The government fears it sets a precedent by jeopardising a key power \u2013 the ability to decide on the business of the House of Commons. With backbenchers conducting a guerrilla campaign against a no-deal Brexit, that is the last thing Downing Street needs. For May, who sat implacable on the frontbench on Wednesday as the row raged around her, it was yet another heavy blow to her dented authority. But the prime minister made another significant concession, in an attempt to win over some leavers. The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, said the government would accept an amendment tabled by the Tory MP Hugo Swire. Among other things, if the future relationship with the EU were not negotiated by mid-2020, it would give MPs the chance to choose between extending the transition period and entering the Irish backstop. Downing Street is also expecting some assurances from the EU27 between now and the moment of truth next Tuesday, though not the overhaul of the legally binding withdrawal agreement the Democratic Unionist party had demanded. Ultimately, though, few at Westminster believe May\u2019s earlier tactic of sending MPs off home for Christmas to calm down and think about their responsibility to deliver on the referendum, had altered the dynamic in this deeply divided parliament. And as the fraught discussions at cabinet on Tuesday underlined, there are scant few options available if the vote is lost, and none of them look appealing. May could make another mad dash to Brussels; give MPs the opportunity to vote on a series of alternative Brexit options (which Tory whips believe might focus minds on the lack of a majority for any alternative to their deal); announce that she plans to leave without a deal; or even press the nuclear button and promise a general election. Whatever she does she will almost certainly face a full-blown vote of no confidence from Jeremy Corbyn within days or even hours of the vote next Tuesday. Before the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, losing a vote on the finance bill on one day and another less than 24 hours later would have most likely proved fatal to a government\u2019s authority. But opposition parties now need to win a formal vote of no confidence and it is unclear whether either the DUP or Tory rebels hate the deal enough to want to tear down the government. May cannot now be unseated by Tory MPs, who tried the no confidence gambit before Christmas and failed, and her cabinet is bitterly divided about the way forward. Some Tory colleagues believe the prime minister\u2019s fabled resilience is such that she could try to keep putting her much maligned deal to MPs, grimly pressing home the fact that, as she repeatedly said on Wednesday, \u201cthe only way to avoid no deal is to vote for the deal\u201d. Whichever path she chooses, more dramatic clashes with parliament lie ahead within a matter of days, however calm the chatter over the canapes at No 10.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 10 January. Top stories The director of the collapsed flight booking service Bestjet has told a meeting of the company\u2019s creditors he was forced to put the company into voluntary administration after he did not receive a promised $3.2m payment from its former owners. With thousands of Australian travellers at risk of losing money from the company\u2019s collapse, the current and former owners have pointed the finger at each other. Robert McVicker, who bought Bestjet only a month before its collapse, told the creditors\u2019 meeting he was expecting a payment from Bestjet Singapore, a company in which Bestjet\u2019s former owner, Rachel James, is still listed as a director. But James has claimed she is \u201cdistraught\u201d over the collapse and blamed McVicker\u2019s management for it. Australia is considering Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun\u2019s request for asylum after the Saudi teenager was found to be a refugee by the United Nations on Wednesday. The 18-year-old woman barricaded herself in a Bangkok airport hotel room on Sunday to prevent her forcible return to Saudi Arabia, where she claims her family will kill her because she has renounced Islam. On Wednesday, the UN high commissioner for refugees assessed Qunun, found her to be a refugee and referred her to Australia for resettlement. A UNHCR spokeswoman told the Guardian Qunun would remain in their care until a long-term solution has been found. \u201cShe remains in a safe location in Bangkok for the time being,\u201d she said. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has warned there will be \u201cno special treatment\u201d for Qunun. Nearly 800,000 federal workers remain without pay in the US after Donald Trump used his first Oval Office address to reiterate his demand for a border wall and stoke immigration fears using dubious claims. Top congressional Democrats accused him of fearmongering and using rhetoric \u201cfull of misinformation and even malice\u201d. The shutdown is now in its 19th day and the president remains at an impasse with congress, saying he has an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to declare an emergency if a deal can\u2019t be made. The shutdown has forced the closure of national parks, placed certain food and drug inspections on hold, and sparked concerns over air travel and healthcare. World Theresa May will be obliged to present UK MPs with a new Brexit plan within three days if her current proposal is voted down next week, after a procedural amendment to the plan\u2019s progress through the Commons was passed amid chaotic scenes. A Cambodian court has jailed a man for three years for insulting the king in Facebook posts, the second known conviction under a new l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law enacted last year that rights groups fear could be used to stifle dissent. Fresh investigations have been launched into allegations of sexual and physical abuse against R&amp;B singer R Kelly. Prosecutors in Chicago and Atlanta have appealed for new information after the airing of Surviving R Kelly, a documentary that contained claims of abuse by the R&amp;B singer. Iranian state TV has for the first time broadcast images of the April 2016 arrest of the imprisoned Iranian-UK dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe at Tehran airport. The pictures of her shocked face were shown during a lengthy documentary that claimed the BBC was trying to undermine the Iranian state by training reporters opposed to the regime. The wife of a Norwegian multimillionaire missing for 10 weeks has probably been kidnapped, police have said. There is no proof that 68-year-old Elisabeth Falkevik Hagen is dead or alive, but a ransom of nearly $15m has been demanded for her return, to be paid in the cryptocurrency Monero. Opinion and analysis Is Instagram ruining travel? The short answer is that claim is a bit hysterical, writes Bridie Jabour. \u201cBut the longer answer: well, maybe Instagram is ruining some things. It is easy to lament the sensation of visiting places just for the \u2019gram as a sign of an increasingly self absorbed society at worst, and unoriginal at best. But we cannot just blame Instagram for these places being mauled by people.\u201d Far from reassuring a troubled nation, Donald Trump\u2019s televised address from the Oval Office on the border wall tried to scare the living daylights out of them, writes Richard Wolffe. \u201cTelevised addresses from the Oval Office have marked historic moments of national anxiety: JFK and the Cuban missile crisis, Ronald Reagan and the Challenger disaster, George HW Bush and the start of the Gulf War. To that august list we can now add Donald Trump and the most pressing crisis facing this commander-in-chief: the disastrous damage already inflicted on his own ego by his dopey idea of a beautiful border wall.\u201d Sport There are growing fitness and form concerns over Britain\u2019s leading hope for the Australian Open, as former world No 1 Andy Murray struggles to return to peak form following hip surgery. Murray and Johanna Konta carry Britain\u2019s slim hopes in Melbourne. The International Cricket Council has announced an unprecedented 15-day amnesty for anyone who has failed to report a corrupt approach in Sri Lanka. The country\u2019s sports minister recently disclosed that the ICC had told him Sri Lanka was considered the most corrupt country in world cricket. Thinking time: Cate Blanchett on theatre as a provocation London\u2019s National Theatre has been overwhelmed by demand for tickets for Cate Blanchett\u2019s latest appearance, the controversial When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other, which looks like being one of the UK\u2019s biggest plays of the year. It is \u2013 at least on paper \u2013 a loose adaptation of Samuel Richardson\u2019s 1740 proto-novel Pamela, relating the story of a young maidservant\u2019s relationship with her employer. It\u2019s been called everything from tawdry S&amp;M to a set of case notes for Stockholm syndrome. \u201cA lot of the things the play brings up is stuff I\u2019ve been thinking about for a long time,\u201d Blanchett says. \u201cThe boundaries of gender, how language constantly fails us and confines us, keeps us in paradigms and frameworks which are frustrating and confounding.\u201d How will a play about the relationship between a predatory, all-powerful man and a woman being employed as a sexual plaything be received in the atmosphere of #MeToo? \u201cI always see theatre as a provocation,\u201d Blanchett says. \u201cYou\u2019re not up there running for office, you\u2019re asking a series of questions. Some people might be enraged, some perplexed, some people might be excited. Hopefully it\u2019s the conversation afterwards that\u2019s the most important.\u201d Media roundup Sweeping overhauls of superannuation could add as much as $500,000 to some accounts, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The government plans to weed out under-performing funds and force regulators to put the consumers\u2019 interests first. The West Australian says record grain prices in WA mean farmers are in for a rare windfall. The $6.5bn harvest is the most valuable in the state\u2019s history. And the ABC reports that 2018 was Australia\u2019s third hottest year on record, and the sixth driest year for NSW. Coming up The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, will lobby for the release of the Melbourne-based refugee soccer player Hakeem Al-Araibi when she makes an official visit to Thailand. Hundreds will converge on Sydney\u2019s Central station today for the trip to the annual Elvis Festival in Parkes.

Yet he has escaped serious sanction because of the allies, many of them in Labour, who see him as one of the most reforming Speakers in a generation \u2013 one who prioritises the will of MPs over any deference to the government. Bercow provoked fury from ministers and Brexit supporters on Wednesday by accepting an amendment which radically curtails the timetable for Theresa May to prepare a \u201cplan B\u201d to present to parliament should she lose the vote next week on her Brexit deal.

      "bodyText": "\ufeffFresh concerns over air quality on the London Underground have been raised after researchers found that the concentration of particulate pollution in tube stations was up to 30 times higher than beside busy roads in the capital. Air pollution experts have called for more analysis of the possible harmful effects of the underground\u2019s particulates. In a report, the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP) warned Transport for London (TfL): \u201cGiven that there is strong evidence that both long- and short-term exposure to particle pollutants in ambient air are harmful to health, it is likely that there is some health risk.\u201d Tests found that the Northern Line had the highest concentration of PM2.5 (tiny particles linked to health problems) with the air on platforms at Hampstead station \u2013 the deepest on the tube network at 60 metres (200ft) below ground level \u2013 recording an average 492 micrograms per cubic metre (\u03bcg/m3) of air, compared with an annual average of 16 \u03bcg/m3 from a roadside monitoring site in the capital. The hitherto unpublished findings from air quality experts at King\u2019s College London were included in the report from COMEAP, commissioned by TfL. It said the London Underground was affected more than any other subway system due to its age and the depths of its tunnels. Passengers are exposed to the same concentration of particulates in an hour on the tube as they are during a full day above ground in ambient London air, the committee found. For road users, it estimated that an equivalent bus journey, typically taking two and a half times as long, would expose a passenger to a third of the pollution. The committee said further investigation was required into the toxicity of the dust breathed in by tube passengers, which is heavier and more metal-based than the smaller, carbon-based particles in the air above ground. However, Prof Frank Kelly, chair of COMEAP, said people should continue to use the tube given the relatively short time spent underground and lack of evidence of harmful effects. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got all this information about the health impacts of the particles above the surface. Below ground, we know we have a higher mass but of a different type \u2013 we don\u2019t yet have the research into the level of the toxicity, and hence the heath risk. \u201cYou\u2019re down there for a short period of time \u2013 passengers should just use the tube as usual until we have better understanding of the risks.\u201d TfL has accepted the recommendations in the report and will carry out further monitoring and testing of dust samples. While the tube operates well within the Health and Safety Executive specified limits, it has set an \u201cinformal target\u201d to limit exposure to dust. It expanded its cleaning regime in 2017 with \u201cmagnetic wands\u201d to reduce dust at 46 stations, but a specialist tunnel-cleaning train was scrapped as unviable in 2014. Peter McNaught, director of asset operations at TfL, said: \u201cWe are committed to maintaining the cleanest air possible for our staff and customers when using the tube.\u201d Caroline Pidgeon, chair of the London Assembly transport committee, said more monitoring of dust and air pollution was vital: \u201cWe need to fully understand the health risk facing passengers and staff from being exposed to high levels of particulate matter.\u201d",

Passenger vehicle sales in mainland China dropped by 5.8% last year to 22.35m, according to the China Passenger Car Association, the first reverse in the world\u2019s biggest car market since 1992. The development came as financial markets around the world rallied following signs of a breakthrough in trade talks between Washington and Beijing, after three days of talks in the Chinese capital. The FTSE 100 closed on Wednesday at a five-week high, ending the day 45 points higher at 6,906. Markets across Europe also recorded gains and Wall Street\u2019s Dow Jones index of the 30 biggest US companies had rallied by more than 150 points midway through Wednesday\u2019s trading session. US officials said China had pledged to buy a \u201csubstantial amount\u201d of agricultural, energy and manufactured goods and services, adding that both countries had discussed \u201cways to achieve fairness, reciprocity and balance in trade relations\u201d. The meetings this week were the first since face-to-face talks between the US president, Donald Trump, and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, late last year, when a 90-day truce was agreed in the trade war, preventing the imposition of additional tariffs on Chinese goods sold in the US. However, a deal still needs to be reached by 2 March, when the White House is due to raise tariff levels from 10% to 25% on $200bn (\u00a3160bn) of Chinese imports. Although the Chinese economy had gradually begun slowing before the trade war escalated, the economy has underperformed expectations in recent months amid the tensions. The International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecast for global GDP growth for 2018 and 2019 on the back of the standoff, while estimating growth in China will fall from about 6.6% last year to 6.2% in 2019. Factory output in China fell for the first time in two years in December, with analysts warning that the trade dispute had harmed demand. Apple also reported a decline in sales in China, blaming softer consumer appetite as the economy cools. News of the weak car sales figures is likely to reverberate around the world, after years of growth for western manufacturers selling to China, while adding to the problems facing European manufacturers from Brexit, new vehicle emissions tests and a move away from diesel cars. Recession fears are growing in Germany, which is home to some of the world\u2019s biggest car manufacturers. Jaguar Land Rover announced in October that it would close its Solihull plant for two weeks because of slumping sales in China, which is the company\u2019s largest market. The firm is expected to announce job cuts on Thursday, to ward off the threat from the drop in sales in China, Brexit and a fall in demand for diesel cars. Despite progress in the US-China trade talks, analysts have cautioned that securing a trade deal remains challenging, while a breakdown in negotiations would trigger fresh turbulence on financial markets. Joshua Mahony, a senior market analyst at the financial trading platform IG, said: \u201cThere is still substantial time left in these negotiations. However, for those hoping to see something tangible this week there could be some disappointment that things are not moving at a faster pace.\u201d",

Here are the details of the plan. How did the MPs\u2019 plan work? Parliament first approved a business motion to allow the debate and vote to go ahead. The cross-party group behind the key amendment, led by the Conservative Dominic Grieve, were hoping that Speaker John Bercow would allow them to bring it forward. The amendment said that following defeat of the government\u2019s plan, which is widely anticipated, \u201ca minister of the crown shall table within three sitting days a motion \u2026 considering the process of exiting the European Union under article 50\u201d. Other MPs who have signed the amendment include the former Tory cabinet minister Sir Oliver Letwin and the Tory ex-ministers Jo Johnson, Guto Bebb and Sam Gyimah. It has also been backed by Labour MPs including Stephen Doughty and Chris Leslie. Bercow\u2019s decision to allow the amendment was greeted angrily by Brexit-supporting Tories, who had argued that Commons precedent dictated that business motions could only be changed by ministers. But Bercow, who won equally noisy support from Labour MPs and some remain-minded Conservatives, insisted he could make the decision, and would side with the interests of parliament over the executive. Why was the amendment important? In the amendment passed by MPs to the withdrawal agreement last year, ministers must give a statement to the House of Commons within 21 days. If and when the prime minister\u2019s plan is voted down on Tuesday, MPs feel they cannot wait potentially until 12 February for the next vote. The amendment, passed by 308 votes to 297, means that May has to return to the Commons to set out the next steps within three days. However, Downing Street has made clear that if next week\u2019s vote were lost, the prime minister would, whether or not the amendment were passed, come back to the House of Commons and set out her plans well before the 21-day time limit set out in the Withdrawal Act. What could the implication be? A previous amendment by Grieve that the Commons voted through before Christmas means that any statement that follows a defeat is in itself amendable \u2013 allowing MPs to put forward their own alternatives for the future of the Brexit process. So if May comes back with an alternative plan, that plan can be amended by MPs, opening up a range of possibilities for parliament to set the direction. What could MPs do to amend that new plan? MPs are likely to try and amend that plan to do any number of things, including a second referendum, a commitment to an EEA-style single market deal or for an extension to article 50. It is not clear yet what would be ruled to be in order \u2013 and even less clear if any of these options would command a parliamentary majority.",

Two years on from losing Dimitri Payet to Marseille, West Ham are aware it would be a PR disaster to sell another of their best players. Arnautovic has become their most important forward in the past 12 months and his recent spell on the sidelines with a hamstring injury underlined his importance to Pellegrini, who does not want to have to sign a replacement this month. West Ham\u2019s position is hardened by the knowledge their other strikers are not in Arnautovic\u2019s class. Javier Hern\u00e1ndez has been inconsistent since signing from Bayer Leverkusen in 2017 and Andy Carroll, whose injury record counts against him, is out of contract in the summer. West Ham will wait until the end of the season before deciding whether to offer Carroll a deal. Lucas P\u00e9rez could be set to leave six months after his \u00a34m move from Arsenal. However West Ham are yet to receive any bids for the forward despite reports suggesting he is a target for Real Betis and Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a.",

      "body": "<p>Seven former Speakers of the House of Commons have been executed. To judge by the looks on the faces of many on the government benches, John Bercow came dangerously close to becoming the eighth. For well over an hour of points of order that came dangerously close to outright entropy, Tory MPs were spitting blood about the Speaker\u2019s decision to allow an amendment by the Conservative Dominic Grieve to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/09/mps-force-theresa-may-to-table-plan-b-if-she-loses-brexit-deal-vote\">force the government to have a vote on a Brexit plan B</a> within three days if its plan A was rejected next Tuesday.</p> <p>Cue absolute scenes. Constitutional outrage, yelled many MPs, working themselves up into an unpleasant shade of purple. A curious description of what appeared to most normal people as a relatively minor disagreement over parliamentary procedures. The cartoon Brexiter Mark Francois was particularly apoplectic. It was all a stitch-up. Bercow was a remainer to his core and he had only granted the amendment in the hope of making a no deal less likely.</p> <p>Bercow was in his element, becoming ever more pompous and self-important in his mannerisms. Francois had been right to say that the original motion said no motion could be moved other than by a minister of the crown, but this was an amendment that didn\u2019t need to be debated. So tough. If the Commons didn\u2019t like the amendment then it could always vote it down. Not that it would, because Bercow wasn\u2019t stupid enough to select a contentious amendment that wouldn\u2019t get passed. The government\u2019s real problem wasn\u2019t the amendment; it was its lack of a majority.</p> <p>\u201cThis is just sophistry,\u201d huffed Francois. It was nothing more than a total abuse of all that was good and pure about Commons procedure. Bercow beamed. The session was going even better than he had dared hope. There was nothing he liked more than being the centre of attention. This was to be the day when he extended his powers a little further.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/08/failing-chris-grayling-is-a-method-loser-worthy-of-an-oscar-john-crace\">Failing Grayling is a method loser worthy of an Oscar | John Crace</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labour MPs weren\u2019t slow to come up with points of order of their own. Either to congratulate the Speaker for his singular display of judgment and brilliance; or to observe that it was a sweet irony that many Tories, who had made taking back control of the sovereignty of the British parliament the defining slogan of the leave campaign, were now so upset that the legislature was being handed greater control over the executive.</p> <p>Be careful what you wish for. A few assorted opposition MPs were so mesmerised by proceedings that all they could do was stand up, make points of order demanding other people would stop standing up to make points of order so the Commons could get on with its business. Much more of this and we\u2019d have disappeared through the looking glass. Not so much about taking back control as needing to get a sodding grip.</p> <p>While all this was going on, the chief whip, Julian Smith, was busy punching texts into his phone and wondering what on earth he had done in a previous life to deserve his current one. He had lost a vote yesterday and he was now certain to lose another one today. He would also lose the Brexit vote next Tuesday and now the one the following week. Not least because there was no plan B to have a vote on. Come to think of it, there was barely a plan A. Whips were supposed to win votes, not lose them. He was becoming the Thinking Man\u2019s Chris Grayling.</p> <p>\u201cJust do something,\u201d he hissed to Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the house. Leadsom obliged by asking Bercow if he had consulted the clerks and, if so, whether they had agreed with his judgment. The Speaker confirmed he had consulted them but refused to divulge the contents of their conversation.</p> <p>Then would he care to publish the clerk\u2019s advice, Leadsom enquired, nudging the irony meters even further into the red as the government had spent the last two years trying to prevent details of any of its Brexit analysis and negotiations from being made public.

      "bodyText": "Seven former Speakers of the House of Commons have been executed. To judge by the looks on the faces of many on the government benches, John Bercow came dangerously close to becoming the eighth. For well over an hour of points of order that came dangerously close to outright entropy, Tory MPs were spitting blood about the Speaker\u2019s decision to allow an amendment by the Conservative Dominic Grieve to force the government to have a vote on a Brexit plan B within three days if its plan A was rejected next Tuesday. Cue absolute scenes. Constitutional outrage, yelled many MPs, working themselves up into an unpleasant shade of purple. A curious description of what appeared to most normal people as a relatively minor disagreement over parliamentary procedures. The cartoon Brexiter Mark Francois was particularly apoplectic. It was all a stitch-up. Bercow was a remainer to his core and he had only granted the amendment in the hope of making a no deal less likely. Bercow was in his element, becoming ever more pompous and self-important in his mannerisms. Francois had been right to say that the original motion said no motion could be moved other than by a minister of the crown, but this was an amendment that didn\u2019t need to be debated. So tough. If the Commons didn\u2019t like the amendment then it could always vote it down. Not that it would, because Bercow wasn\u2019t stupid enough to select a contentious amendment that wouldn\u2019t get passed. The government\u2019s real problem wasn\u2019t the amendment; it was its lack of a majority. \u201cThis is just sophistry,\u201d huffed Francois. It was nothing more than a total abuse of all that was good and pure about Commons procedure. Bercow beamed. The session was going even better than he had dared hope. There was nothing he liked more than being the centre of attention. This was to be the day when he extended his powers a little further. Labour MPs weren\u2019t slow to come up with points of order of their own. Either to congratulate the Speaker for his singular display of judgment and brilliance; or to observe that it was a sweet irony that many Tories, who had made taking back control of the sovereignty of the British parliament the defining slogan of the leave campaign, were now so upset that the legislature was being handed greater control over the executive. Be careful what you wish for. A few assorted opposition MPs were so mesmerised by proceedings that all they could do was stand up, make points of order demanding other people would stop standing up to make points of order so the Commons could get on with its business. Much more of this and we\u2019d have disappeared through the looking glass. Not so much about taking back control as needing to get a sodding grip. While all this was going on, the chief whip, Julian Smith, was busy punching texts into his phone and wondering what on earth he had done in a previous life to deserve his current one. He had lost a vote yesterday and he was now certain to lose another one today. He would also lose the Brexit vote next Tuesday and now the one the following week. Not least because there was no plan B to have a vote on. Come to think of it, there was barely a plan A. Whips were supposed to win votes, not lose them. He was becoming the Thinking Man\u2019s Chris Grayling. \u201cJust do something,\u201d he hissed to Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the house. Leadsom obliged by asking Bercow if he had consulted the clerks and, if so, whether they had agreed with his judgment. The Speaker confirmed he had consulted them but refused to divulge the contents of their conversation. Then would he care to publish the clerk\u2019s advice, Leadsom enquired, nudging the irony meters even further into the red as the government had spent the last two years trying to prevent details of any of its Brexit analysis and negotiations from being made public. Bercow beamed. If it was all the same to the house, he\u2019d rather keep his discussions private. He shrugged. He knew he was winging it a bit, but what the hell? He was on a roll and he\u2019d got away with it so far. What was the purpose of precedent, if not to be broken from time to time? Hell, if everything had stayed the same since the middle ages, he\u2019d have been a dead man long ago. And if he could do his bit to save the country from a no-deal Brexit then so much the better. On and on it went. Jacob Rees-Mogg made a point that was only intelligible to him and was almost certainly incorrect, while Crispin Blunt accused Bercow of outright bias and urged him to stand down. No chance. Bercow had the numbers as the vote on the amendment would prove.",

      "bodyText": "Two environmental protesters against the HS2 high-speed rail link have pleaded not guilty to aggravated trespass charges in relation to obstructing a digger on one of the company\u2019s construction sites. The HS2 development has generated controversy about cost, usefulness and possible environmental damage. Environmental protesters have established a protest camp close to one of the HS2 works sites in the Colne Valley nature reserve in Hillingdon, home to a variety of fauna and flora including bats, owls and osprey. Protesters have staged various demonstrations at the west London site in recent months. Wednesday\u2019s charges at Uxbridge magistrates\u2019 court relate to a protest at the Colne Valley site on 11 December last year by Sarah Green, 63, a Green party activist, and Laura Hughes, 37, from the environmental direct action group Extinction Rebellion. Green is alleged to have climbed on top of an HS2 digger while Hughes is alleged to have handcuffed herself to the digger. The protesters have expressed concern that the HS2 work was causing damage to some of London\u2019s water supply, which is sourced from the Colne Valley. Dozens of environmental protesters from the Green party and Extinction Rebellion, filled the courtroom and staged a protest with a banner outside the court. The district judge presiding over the case, Deborah Wright, said she was not going to allow the case to be used as a \u201cpolitical platform\u201d. She said: \u201cIt seems to me that no one is going to dispute that both defendants are genuinely concerned about HS2 and the problems it may cause.\u201d At the time of the 11 December protest, HS2 contractors were working on a stretch of the high-speed rail link along Harvil Road in Hillingdon. This latest case involving peaceful protest follows that of the Stansted 15 protesters, who are appealing against conviction for a terror offence for blocking the take-off of a deportation charter flight from Stansted airport. The HS2 contractors were carrying out works to pile drive into the chalk aquifer in a wetland field along Newyears Green bourne, in a designated drinking water protection area. Sailesh Mehta, the counsel for Sarah Green, told the court this area in the Colne Valley provides 22% of London\u2019s drinking water. Mehta told the judge that he wanted to explore who owned the land where the alleged aggravated trespass took place and the lawfulness of the arrest of Green. Mehta said outside the court: \u201cThis case epitomises the friction between the legitimate right to protest, the legitimate intent to protect the water supply of Londoners and the state\u2019s right to build structures.\u201d The hearing will resume at Uxbridge magistrates court on 1 April.",

In the Commons today there was passionate debate on a point of parliamentary procedure \u2013 what kinds of motions can be amended and by whom \u2013 arcane enough to flummox veterans. Outside the Palace of Westminster, supporters and opponents of Brexit wave placards and shout slogans. A healthy democracy needs both political styles. Both also have limits. Parliament can be too rarefied and too raucous at the same time. But the more appalling spectacle is pro-Brexit protesters outside parliament harassing and intimidating MPs, obstructing their paths and hurling abuse. The perpetrators wore high-visibility vests in emulation of the massive French gilets jaunes protests, but their numbers were few \u2013 a handful of thugs from the far-right fringe. MPs have expressed concern to police, who appeared reluctant to intervene. Some alarm is justified given the 2016 murder of Jo Cox by an ultra-nationalist. That doctrine venerates paramilitary organisation and violence.

      "body": "<p>Julia Grant, who began life as George Roberts, and who has died aged 64, changed the way Britain viewed transgender people in the 1970s.</p> <p>She was the first \u201ctranssexual\u201d, as trans people were then called, publicly to share her story on television. In five hour-long film documentaries, which I directed, and which were transmitted as the BBC2 series A Change of Sex, her story gripped the nation, with nearly nine million viewers watching the first episode, George and Julia, in 1979. The films, intimate, frank and observational, were shown between then and 1999, as new episodes unfolded in her story.</p> <p>The series followed her challenging attempts to become Julia in the unflinching glare of the cameras. Before this, the world of transgender people had been shadowy, due to ignorance, prejudice and abuse. There was little thought given to allowing them their legitimate aspirations or a choice to live openly as themselves. In her lifetime, Julia saw the transgender community expand and gain acceptance beyond all expectations, a change helped by her own activism for greater understanding and better treatment.</p> <p>In 1978, as we began filming, Julia, in her early 20s, had moved to London after a failed marriage, entered the gay scene and become a drag queen \u2013 Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien by Edith Piaf was one of her lip-synch songs. Soon drag did not feel right to her and we filmed her last show. She had decided that she was not homosexual. She wanted to live as a woman.</p> <p>Julia began living, working and dressing as a woman, a precondition for getting treatment at the small Charing Cross unit that was the main clinic in the UK dealing with transgender patients. She asked me for some suggestions for a new name. I gave her a long list and she quickly chose. She thought Julia Grant had a \u201cgood Scottish ring to it\u201d.</p> <p>I persuaded the NHS psychiatrist who ran the clinic to let us film all his consultations with Julia and he agreed, with the proviso that he would not be named or seen on screen. Others much later revealed him to be John Randell. Although he was not identified on film, his voice suggested a plummy sense of entitled authority, tinged with arrogance, often expressing stereotypical attitudes towards women, even by 70s standards. </p> <p>The week before the first film was transmitted, some Sunday tabloids printed stories that were hostile towards Julia and the films. However, her determination to become the \u201cwoman I want to be\u201d, coupled with her gritty humour while overcoming her setbacks, and notably the way she was treated by Randell, convinced many TV viewers that her cause was legitimate. </p> <p>The BBC received an enormous postbag in support of her and of the films. I dutifully replied to the letters, and more films followed.</p> <p>In her various jobs, which included NHS catering manager, writer, DJ, ceramics teacher and supplier, Julia pushed through in her own singular way. She had a quick wit, a witheringly sharp tongue and, if cornered or physically threatened, was not afraid occasionally to use her fists.</p> <p>She was born in Blackpool as George, the eldest son of Phillip Roberts, a trawlerman, and his wife, Jessica, and brought up in Fleetwood, Lancashire. Phillip\u2019s relationship with Jessica, an alcoholic, was chaotic; she attempted suicide several times. Phillip was a violent drunkard who tried to rape George as a child. One of eight children, he often looked after his younger brothers and sisters. There were periods spent in a children\u2019s home in Preston. As a teenager, George prostituted himself to men, as \u201ca misguided cry\u201d for the affection that he did not find from his parents. The money paid for sweets.</p> <p>Conditioned by growing up in the tough fishing port, with its hard-drinking, direct-speaking community, which struggled with a precarious survival from the dangerous North Atlantic fishing grounds, George set forth into wild seas, with a new course and destination, as Julia, to change sex and live exactly as she defined herself as a woman.</p> <p>By 1979, as our filming continued, Julia was living with Amir, a refugee who had fled from persecution in Iraq. He accepted Julia as a woman and they seemed very happy. Julia decided that, as they wanted to progress the relationship, operations would not wait. In a series of combative encounters, Randell dismissed Julia\u2019s ambitions.</p> <p>She was not ladylike enough, in his view, and far too pushy. \u201cIt is my life,\u201d Julia told me and others, often with an expletive attached. She disobeyed Randell and found a way of getting breast implants at a private clinic. He was furious and it became clear to Julia he would not support her wish for full genital surgery.</p> <p>Michael Royle, a private surgeon, who with a colleague was sympathetic to Julia\u2019s predicament, agreed to operate. Joking to me as the cameras followed her into the operating theatre, Julia waved and, laughing, said: \u201cBye, Mum\u201d. The film crew and I found the surgery more alarming than she did and tried to \u201cunsee\u201d what we witnessed that day with a lot of wine later that night.</p> <p>I was with her the next day when she woke up, in great pain but ecstatic. The operation seemed to be successful, but time was needed to recuperate and for some years our filming was paused. Julia later told us on film that, a few weeks after the surgery, she had collapsed bleeding. She was taken to hospital unconscious and treated for a suspected miscarriage by doctors unaware of her medical history.</p> <p>The surgery was damaged and sex became out of the question.

      "bodyText": "Julia Grant, who began life as George Roberts, and who has died aged 64, changed the way Britain viewed transgender people in the 1970s. She was the first \u201ctranssexual\u201d, as trans people were then called, publicly to share her story on television. In five hour-long film documentaries, which I directed, and which were transmitted as the BBC2 series A Change of Sex, her story gripped the nation, with nearly nine million viewers watching the first episode, George and Julia, in 1979. The films, intimate, frank and observational, were shown between then and 1999, as new episodes unfolded in her story. The series followed her challenging attempts to become Julia in the unflinching glare of the cameras. Before this, the world of transgender people had been shadowy, due to ignorance, prejudice and abuse. There was little thought given to allowing them their legitimate aspirations or a choice to live openly as themselves. In her lifetime, Julia saw the transgender community expand and gain acceptance beyond all expectations, a change helped by her own activism for greater understanding and better treatment. In 1978, as we began filming, Julia, in her early 20s, had moved to London after a failed marriage, entered the gay scene and become a drag queen \u2013 Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien by Edith Piaf was one of her lip-synch songs. Soon drag did not feel right to her and we filmed her last show. She had decided that she was not homosexual. She wanted to live as a woman. Julia began living, working and dressing as a woman, a precondition for getting treatment at the small Charing Cross unit that was the main clinic in the UK dealing with transgender patients. She asked me for some suggestions for a new name. I gave her a long list and she quickly chose. She thought Julia Grant had a \u201cgood Scottish ring to it\u201d. I persuaded the NHS psychiatrist who ran the clinic to let us film all his consultations with Julia and he agreed, with the proviso that he would not be named or seen on screen. Others much later revealed him to be John Randell. Although he was not identified on film, his voice suggested a plummy sense of entitled authority, tinged with arrogance, often expressing stereotypical attitudes towards women, even by 70s standards. The week before the first film was transmitted, some Sunday tabloids printed stories that were hostile towards Julia and the films. However, her determination to become the \u201cwoman I want to be\u201d, coupled with her gritty humour while overcoming her setbacks, and notably the way she was treated by Randell, convinced many TV viewers that her cause was legitimate. The BBC received an enormous postbag in support of her and of the films. I dutifully replied to the letters, and more films followed. In her various jobs, which included NHS catering manager, writer, DJ, ceramics teacher and supplier, Julia pushed through in her own singular way. She had a quick wit, a witheringly sharp tongue and, if cornered or physically threatened, was not afraid occasionally to use her fists. She was born in Blackpool as George, the eldest son of Phillip Roberts, a trawlerman, and his wife, Jessica, and brought up in Fleetwood, Lancashire. Phillip\u2019s relationship with Jessica, an alcoholic, was chaotic; she attempted suicide several times. Phillip was a violent drunkard who tried to rape George as a child. One of eight children, he often looked after his younger brothers and sisters. There were periods spent in a children\u2019s home in Preston. As a teenager, George prostituted himself to men, as \u201ca misguided cry\u201d for the affection that he did not find from his parents. The money paid for sweets. Conditioned by growing up in the tough fishing port, with its hard-drinking, direct-speaking community, which struggled with a precarious survival from the dangerous North Atlantic fishing grounds, George set forth into wild seas, with a new course and destination, as Julia, to change sex and live exactly as she defined herself as a woman. By 1979, as our filming continued, Julia was living with Amir, a refugee who had fled from persecution in Iraq. He accepted Julia as a woman and they seemed very happy. Julia decided that, as they wanted to progress the relationship, operations would not wait. In a series of combative encounters, Randell dismissed Julia\u2019s ambitions. She was not ladylike enough, in his view, and far too pushy. \u201cIt is my life,\u201d Julia told me and others, often with an expletive attached. She disobeyed Randell and found a way of getting breast implants at a private clinic. He was furious and it became clear to Julia he would not support her wish for full genital surgery. Michael Royle, a private surgeon, who with a colleague was sympathetic to Julia\u2019s predicament, agreed to operate. Joking to me as the cameras followed her into the operating theatre, Julia waved and, laughing, said: \u201cBye, Mum\u201d. The film crew and I found the surgery more alarming than she did and tried to \u201cunsee\u201d what we witnessed that day with a lot of wine later that night. I was with her the next day when she woke up, in great pain but ecstatic. The operation seemed to be successful, but time was needed to recuperate and for some years our filming was paused. Julia later told us on film that, a few weeks after the surgery, she had collapsed bleeding. She was taken to hospital unconscious and treated for a suspected miscarriage by doctors unaware of her medical history. The surgery was damaged and sex became out of the question. Embarrassed to seek help, or tell Amir why she could not have sex, and for once worried about what people would say, she imagined that she would not be able to get any more treatment. It was perhaps the lowest point of her life. Things became difficult with Amir; they split up and he left the country. The last film picked up with Julia in the late 90s. She was by then living in Manchester, running the busy Hollywood Show Bar and intent on marrying her new partner, Alan Sunderland. She was checked again by Royle, who said he could resolve the previous surgical problem, but Julia decided in consultation with Alan that she would not trouble herself with more surgery. They could be happy as they were. They had a church blessing and Julia considered herself to be married. After the final episode was shown, I stayed in touch with Julia. She had written two books, George &amp; Julia (1980) and Just Julia (1994), about her experiences. She owned various cafes and bars in Manchester\u2019s Gay Village (and fought against plans for the area\u2019s redevelopment) and was active in setting up LGBTQ events there. A happy ending seemed to have arrived. Julia and Alan moved to France and enjoyed life in the Creuse region, where the locals called her \u201cLa Madame Anglaise\u201d, and where Julia successfully built up a large ceramics business. One morning, however, Alan ate breakfast and then left her, never to return. After this, she moved to Spain and ran a hotel in Benidorm, where she set up Benidorm Gay Pride. A diagnosis of bowel cancer led Julia to return in 2015 to the UK. She devoted herself to helping other trans people and to encouraging improved trans care services, contributing to discussions at the NHS\u2019s Nye Bevan Academy, which trains health service leaders. She would point out to those seeking gender reassignment that changing sex would not solve all their problems, and some of her views were considered controversial by members of the transgender community. Julia is survived her sisters, Shirley, Jeanne, Lesley, Julie and Beverley, her brothers, Gary and Danny, and an aunt, Mary. \u2022 Julia Grant, transgender activist, born 21 September 1954; died 2 January 2019",

There is a need to think critically about how disability is being defined, writes academic Dr Alison Wilde in her book Film, Comedy and Disability, \u201cwith representational and employment concerns deeply interwoven into the film industry\u2019s ideologies, practices and processes \u2026 There are dangers we may thwart our own goals.\u201d The result of this self-perpetuating cycle is limited opportunities to tell the disabled story in all its dimensions. Disabled actor-writer Mat Fraser, who played \u201ccrippled\u201d Richard III last year, summed it up: \u201cIdeally, anybody should be able to play any body, but only when there is a truly level playing field of opportunity.\u201d Every theatre should commission at least one disabled playwright and cast at least one disabled actor each year, he wrote, as a condition of arts funding. Don\u2019t tell me there are no disabled actors with talent. This week, I watched Silent Witness with Liz Carr, a disabled actor who, for seven years, has played disabled lab technician Clarissa Mullery. Carr, an alumni of Graeae Theatre Company, was excellent as usual, yet here\u2019s the rub \u2013 she only got a handful of lines on Monday.",

It brings together a number of citizens small enough over a reasonable period of time to become well informed on the principles and technicalities involved. It is not a marketing campaign, but an educational enterprise. I rejoice.<br><strong>Howard </strong><strong>Hilton</strong><br><em>Audlem, Cheshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your front page (9 January) carried these messages, in an extract from your editorial: 1) \u201cThe message must be that this country needs a new and fairer deal\u201d I believe that is true; 2) \u201cand that this is best guaranteed by a better Britain in a better Europe.\u201d I believe that is true; 3) \u201cThe government has failed\u201d I believe that is true; 4) \u201c\u2026 so we must go back to the people.\u201d If that means a second referendum, I believe that is not true.</p> <p>The 2016 referendum was ill conceived by a government desperate to dig itself out of a hole, Is that different now? It was badly executed. The wrong question was asked of the wrong electorate at the wrong time. Would that be different now? It was intended as advisory but treated as binding. Is that different now? If you aren\u2019t convinced yet, perhaps you watched the film Brexit which showed an eminently repeatable set of events. So what should happen?</p> <p>I believe that parliament, the ultimate law-making body in the UK, should revoke its article 50 notice, so prematurely sent, and the whole sorry mess would end. Government response to the question \u201cCan article 50 be revoked?\u201d has been: \u201cIt\u2019s not government policy\u201d. Presumably that means \u201cyes\u201d. So, that\u2019s what we should do now. And later, when the dust has settled, have a real people\u2019s vote in a general election.<br><strong>Celia Wilson</strong><br><em>Didcot, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your editorial suggests that it is time to take the matter of Brexit out of parliament and back to the people. I agree. However, you appear to avoid calling for the traditional mechanism of a general election and instead suggest a somewhat convoluted process of a citizens\u2019 assembly followed at some point by a reconfigured second referendum. The problem is that if the discussion takes place in the same climate as we currently have, the conclusion is likely to be much the same. That\u2019s why I, and no doubt other Guardian readers, will be gathering at Portland Place in London on Saturday to join the people\u2019s assembly march. It will call for the much-heralded end to austerity to actually happen and challenge the rise of racism. Both of these are essential prerequisites for a more a rational Brexit debate.<br><strong>Keith Flett</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The issue should be decided by intelligent, well-informed people from across the political and cultural spectrum of parliament. If their decision reverses Brexit and attracts the ire of vehement Brexiters, so be it. It won\u2019t be the first time parliament has ignored the so-called public will.<br><strong>Michael Heaton</strong><br><em>Warminster, Wiltshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 For once, a leading article that leads: thank you.

Howard Hilton Audlem, Cheshire \u2022 Your front page (9 January) carried these messages, in an extract from your editorial: 1) \u201cThe message must be that this country needs a new and fairer deal\u201d I believe that is true; 2) \u201cand that this is best guaranteed by a better Britain in a better Europe.\u201d I believe that is true; 3) \u201cThe government has failed\u201d I believe that is true; 4) \u201c\u2026 so we must go back to the people.\u201d If that means a second referendum, I believe that is not true. The 2016 referendum was ill conceived by a government desperate to dig itself out of a hole, Is that different now? It was badly executed. The wrong question was asked of the wrong electorate at the wrong time. Would that be different now? It was intended as advisory but treated as binding. Is that different now? If you aren\u2019t convinced yet, perhaps you watched the film Brexit which showed an eminently repeatable set of events. So what should happen? I believe that parliament, the ultimate law-making body in the UK, should revoke its article 50 notice, so prematurely sent, and the whole sorry mess would end. Government response to the question \u201cCan article 50 be revoked?\u201d has been: \u201cIt\u2019s not government policy\u201d. Presumably that means \u201cyes\u201d. So, that\u2019s what we should do now. And later, when the dust has settled, have a real people\u2019s vote in a general election. Celia Wilson Didcot, Oxfordshire \u2022 Your editorial suggests that it is time to take the matter of Brexit out of parliament and back to the people. I agree. However, you appear to avoid calling for the traditional mechanism of a general election and instead suggest a somewhat convoluted process of a citizens\u2019 assembly followed at some point by a reconfigured second referendum. The problem is that if the discussion takes place in the same climate as we currently have, the conclusion is likely to be much the same. That\u2019s why I, and no doubt other Guardian readers, will be gathering at Portland Place in London on Saturday to join the people\u2019s assembly march. It will call for the much-heralded end to austerity to actually happen and challenge the rise of racism. Both of these are essential prerequisites for a more a rational Brexit debate. Keith Flett London \u2022 The issue should be decided by intelligent, well-informed people from across the political and cultural spectrum of parliament. If their decision reverses Brexit and attracts the ire of vehement Brexiters, so be it. It won\u2019t be the first time parliament has ignored the so-called public will. Michael Heaton Warminster, Wiltshire \u2022 For once, a leading article that leads: thank you. You should give credit where it\u2019s due by acknowledging that it was Gordon Brown who put the idea of a citizens\u2019 assembly on the table in his November speech at the Institute for Government.

Heckford says a Labrador named Tito then jumped onto the truck bed, \u201cstepped on the safety of Branch\u2019s shotgun and pulled the trigger.\u201d He says the 12-gauge shotgun shell fired through the side of the truck and hit Branch\u2019s left thigh. He says Branch has since had the leg amputated and has undergone several surgeries, but his cognitive abilities appear to be fine and he is expected to recover. The 6ft 6in Branch made 28 appearances for the Tigers from 2009 through 2011, seeing action at guard and tight end, before a series of injuries cut his career short during a junior season that saw LSU advance to the national championship game. Heckford said the gruesome incident and how it happened led him to contemplate gun safety. \u201cAll of us have hunted for 20 years or more and none of us thought about that happening,\u201d Heckford told the newspaper. \u201cWe were just moving 200 yards to set up and hunt. The opportunities for an accident are there and we just don\u2019t realize it. We think we\u2019re being safe, but are we? If there\u2019s a shell in that gun, anything can happen.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>S<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jan/04/sindhu-vee-funniest-things\">indhu Vee</a> has a more interesting hinterland than most debut standups. She\u2019s an ex-banker, has been married for 20 years and has three children. In her maiden solo set, she ignores the world of finance \u2013 saving it for a future show, perhaps? \u2013 and talks exclusively about things domestic. Sandhog is her treatise on long-term marriage, asking: How do you make it last? What\u2019s love got to do with it? And, most importantly \u2013 with frequent reference to Vee\u2019s battle of wits with her Danish husband \u2013 who wins?</p> <p>It can feel as much like a lesson as an entertainment. Vee (<a href=\"http://sindhuvee.com/#About%20me\">full name Venkatanarayanan</a>) has a teacherly style: her pacing deliberate, her core principles imparted to the audience by rote, her high-status manner implying wisdom to convey. This feels a bit deflating early on, as you accept that the jokes here may be frugally disbursed. But it has its rewards. Yes, marital cliches crop up in Sandhog, but Vee\u2019s spirit of inquiry feels genuine and she poses insightful questions about the rewards and unromantic realities of lifelong partnerships.</p> <p>The cliches don\u2019t detain us long. There are throwaway mother-in-law gags, and a routine about farting in bed as a relationship landmark. A snippet of humdrum domestic conversation brings to mind<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/20/bridget-christie-brighton-dome-review-award-winning-standup-trashing-label-defined-her\"> Bridget Christie\u2019s funnier and more extreme </a>take on similar bland exchanges. Like many minority ethnic comics before her, Vee jokes about parental discipline, citing her Indian mum\u2019s no-nonsense approach. Once choice gag finds Vee\u2019s son calling her \u201cintrusive\u201d. Her response \u2013 and the withering look that accompanies it \u2013 makes mincemeat of the complaint.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jan/04/sindhu-vee-funniest-things\">Sindhu Vee: \u2018The funniest word? Discombobulated is a contender\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Winning such arguments, according to Vee, is what family life is all about. I wasn\u2019t persuaded by that: her smugness feels forced. But there\u2019s hard-won authenticity elsewhere, in the contrast drawn between getting and staying married, the riff on love in a decades-long relationship (\u201cso much of this feels like hate\u201d), and her routine in which she proposes that \u201ckids are to marriage as tsunamis are to beach holidays\u201d. It\u2019s an engaging debut, in which our ex-banker host measures out the profits and losses of domestic commitment, and finds herself just about in the black.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://sohotheatre.com/shows/sindhu-vee-sandhog/\">Soho theatre, London,</a> until 19 January and from 6 to 16 May. <a href=\"https://www.chortle.co.uk/comics/s/34315/sindhu_vee\">Also touring</a> from <a href=\"http://sindhuvee.com/#Live\">1 February to 3 April</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sindhu Vee has a more interesting hinterland than most debut standups. She\u2019s an ex-banker, has been married for 20 years and has three children. In her maiden solo set, she ignores the world of finance \u2013 saving it for a future show, perhaps? \u2013 and talks exclusively about things domestic. Sandhog is her treatise on long-term marriage, asking: How do you make it last? What\u2019s love got to do with it? And, most importantly \u2013 with frequent reference to Vee\u2019s battle of wits with her Danish husband \u2013 who wins? It can feel as much like a lesson as an entertainment. Vee (full name Venkatanarayanan) has a teacherly style: her pacing deliberate, her core principles imparted to the audience by rote, her high-status manner implying wisdom to convey. This feels a bit deflating early on, as you accept that the jokes here may be frugally disbursed. But it has its rewards. Yes, marital cliches crop up in Sandhog, but Vee\u2019s spirit of inquiry feels genuine and she poses insightful questions about the rewards and unromantic realities of lifelong partnerships. The cliches don\u2019t detain us long. There are throwaway mother-in-law gags, and a routine about farting in bed as a relationship landmark. A snippet of humdrum domestic conversation brings to mind Bridget Christie\u2019s funnier and more extreme take on similar bland exchanges. Like many minority ethnic comics before her, Vee jokes about parental discipline, citing her Indian mum\u2019s no-nonsense approach. Once choice gag finds Vee\u2019s son calling her \u201cintrusive\u201d. Her response \u2013 and the withering look that accompanies it \u2013 makes mincemeat of the complaint. Winning such arguments, according to Vee, is what family life is all about. I wasn\u2019t persuaded by that: her smugness feels forced. But there\u2019s hard-won authenticity elsewhere, in the contrast drawn between getting and staying married, the riff on love in a decades-long relationship (\u201cso much of this feels like hate\u201d), and her routine in which she proposes that \u201ckids are to marriage as tsunamis are to beach holidays\u201d. It\u2019s an engaging debut, in which our ex-banker host measures out the profits and losses of domestic commitment, and finds herself just about in the black. \u2022 At Soho theatre, London, until 19 January and from 6 to 16 May. Also touring from 1 February to 3 April.",

      "bodyText": "The director of the collapsed flight-booking service Bestjet has told a meeting of the company\u2019s creditors that he was forced to go into voluntary administration after he did not receive a promised $3.2m payment from the company\u2019s former owners. Last week Guardian Australia reported the Queensland-based budget airfare company Bestjet had gone into voluntary administration just days before Christmas. Its collapse left travellers who booked flights through the company thousands of dollars out of pocket and desperate for answers. According to the minutes of a creditors\u2019 meeting held last week, Bestjet owes about $7.28m to about 2,300 unsecured creditors. The company\u2019s administrators, Pilot Partners, told the meeting they were receiving about 400 creditor inquiries each day. Bestjet\u2019s new owner told the meeting he had been \u201clegally obliged\u201d to place the company into administration after a promised $3.2m payment from its Singaporean arm never materialised. Bestjet was founded by Rachel James, the wife of former Air Australia owner and chief executive Michael James, just weeks after the budget airline\u2019s high-profile collapse in 2012. It was sold to McVicker International in November and its sole director, Robert Bruce McVicker, has not spoken publicly since the company\u2019s collapse. But a transcript of comments made by McVicker at a creditors\u2019 meeting last week reveal he blamed \u201cmisleading and deceptive actions by others\u201d on Bestjet\u2019s collapse.. The transcript, lodged with Asic, reveals McVicker told creditors a promised $3.2m payment from Bestjet Singapore had never been made. Company records show Rachel James is still a director of Bestjet Singapore. \u201cLater in my tenure, we were told a $3.2m payment would be transferred from Bestjet Singapore (an entity outside of the Bestjet Group\u2019s control) on or before the 17th of December, however this did not materialise,\u201d McVicker said, according to the transcript lodged with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. \u201cI was then legally obliged as director to place the Bestjet Group into voluntary administration.\u201d McVicker International was only registered in October, a few weeks before the sale, and minutes from the creditors\u2019 meeting show the administrators appointed to the company believe there is \u201cevidence that 50% of the shares were held on trust\u201d for Rachel James. But while thousands of Australian travellers stand to lose money from the company\u2019s collapse, both McVicker and Rachel James have pointed the finger at each other. McVicker told the meeting he had received \u201cno financial benefit\u201d from his involvement with Bestjet, and said his reputation had been \u201cirretrievable damaged\u201d because of his involvement with the company. \u201cNotwithstanding I had a legal obligation to place the Bestjet group into voluntary administration, I felt doing so was the only way a thorough investigation could occur and would give the best and fairest outcome for creditors,\u201d he told the meeting. He said he entered the business \u201cwith integrity, high hopes and optimism\u201d and that \u201cdue to legal issues based on misleading and deceptive actions by others I am restrained at this time to give more detailed information\u201d. It comes after Rachel James released a statement on Saturday blaming McVicker for the company\u2019s collapse, saying she and her family were \u201cdistraught\u201d to learn that Bestjet had gone into administration. \u201cDuring the last eight weeks, under new ownership and management, Bestjet has gone from a profitable business that followed stringent operational, financial and industry protocols, to one that has devastated thousands of customers and hundreds of staff,\u201d James said.

      "body": "<p>Cate Blanchett strides into the room and plomps herself down on the sofa. In front of us \u2013 this is meant to be lunch \u2013 a table is piled high with sandwiches, fruit, salads and a copy of the script she has spent all morning rehearsing. She prods at it with a finger, hooting with laughter. \u201cAny pointers?\u201d she asks. I glance across at the other sofa, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/24/martin-crimp-theatre-the-treatment-almeida\">Martin Crimp, the playwright</a>, is settling himself in. He gazes back impassively. This might be a joke; it might not.</p> <p>We\u2019re backstage at the National Theatre to discuss Blanchett\u2019s appearance in Crimp\u2019s new play \u2013 her debut here, and her first appearance on the London stage in seven years. Also squeezing on to the sofas are Blanchett\u2019s director, Katie Mitchell, and her co-star Stephen Dillane. To call the production hotly anticipated is something of an undersell: demand for tickets was so high that the theatre was forced to <a href=\"https://www.timeout.com/london/news/your-chance-to-see-cate-blanchett-at-the-national-theatre-begins-on-thursday-111618\">introduce a Hamilton-style ballot</a> (a few day tickets are left, if you\u2019re able to queue).

Entitled <a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/when-we-have-sufficiently-tortured-each-other\">When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other</a>, it is \u2013 at least on paper \u2013 a loose adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/restoration-18th-century-literature/articles/an-introduction-to-pamela-or-virtue-rewarded\">Samuel Richardson\u2019s 1740 proto-novel Pamela</a>. Relating the story of a young maidservant\u2019s relationship with her employer, the book <a href=\"https://daily.jstor.org/why-the-first-novel-created-such-a-stir/\">scandalised readers when it was first published</a>. Composed of a series of letters in which Pamela relates how she is pursued by the mysterious \u201cMr B\u201d, then sexually assaulted, it ends with her finally (and apparently enthusiastically) agreeing to marry him. It\u2019s been called everything from tawdry S&amp;M to a set of case notes for Stockholm syndrome.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an archetypal story: Beauty and the Beast,\u201d says Crimp. \u201cOr, to be more blunt, predator and prey.\u201d</p> <p>In the play, the problems of the novel are sharpened. Although the characters played by Blanchett and Dillane often resemble Pamela and Mr B, at other times they seem to blur into each other, or transform into other people entirely. At the play\u2019s opening, the scenario seems grimly clear: Mr B is a bullying despot, Pamela his cowering victim. A few scenes in, however \u2013 there are 12 in all, each responding to a different fragment or aspect of the novel \u2013 the ground has begun to shift. Images of voyeurism and violence proliferate: is the audience being challenged, titillated, or both? Is, in fact, the woman controlling her master, rather than the other way around? </p> <p>Dillane says: \u201cThere\u2019s a line in the play, \u2018I took you \u2013 against your will \u2013 was it against your will? \u2013 jury\u2019s out.\u2019\u201d He pauses. \u201cThat\u2019s the question: who\u2019s doing what to whom?\u201d</p> <p>The script reminds Blanchett of the boundary-breaking writers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/rachel-cusk\">Rachel Cusk</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/21/argonauts-maggie-nelson-the-red-parts-interview-rachel-cooke\">Maggie Nelson</a>: \u201cA lot of the things the play brings up is stuff I\u2019ve been thinking about for a long time. The boundaries of gender, how language constantly fails us and confines us, keeps us in paradigms and frameworks which are frustrating and confounding.\u201d</p> <p>Mitchell doesn\u2019t want to reveal too much about what audiences will see when the lights go down \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s a spoiler!\u201d she laughs \u2013 but says the production will be set in the present day, not a periwig or petticoat in sight. \u201cNo Downton Abbey,\u201d she adds, in case anyone was expecting it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"950ffdd96228e54ff728913928a80011d5a664fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/950ffdd96228e54ff728913928a80011d5a664fe/0_0_2700_1850/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cate Blanchett in her breakthrough role as Queen Elizabeth I.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From vulnerability to imperiousness \u2026 Cate Blanchett in her breakthrough role as Queen Elizabeth I.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It isn\u2019t hard to see what might have attracted Blanchett to a part that requires such shape-shifting. Her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/dec/01/culture.features\">breakthrough movie role as Elizabeth</a>, two decades ago, showed an actor revelling in her ability to switch from vulnerability to imperiousness almost between frames. Since then, there have been epic movie franchises (Indiana Jones, a gaggle of Hobbits, Lord of the Rings) alongside independent releases; classy, elegant fare (Carol, The Aviator, Blue Jasmine \u2013 the latter two winning her Oscars) as well as kooky avant-garde shorts; and the film I\u2019m Not There, in which she played Bob Dylan. In some recent films \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1HosLWM0o\">Manifesto, in which she played no fewer than 13 different roles</a>, among them a power-dressed newsreader and a bearded homeless man \u2013 she seems to work through her entire repertoire in a matter of minutes.</p> <p>As a stage actor, too, Blanchett has been eager to take chances. In 2006, she put a burgeoning movie career on ice to move back to Australia and <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/blanchett-keeping-calm-about-theatre-debt-20061213-gdp1li.html\">run Sydney Theatre Company with her husband, the playwright-screenwriter Andrew Upton</a>. Though Blanchett stepped down from the co-directorship in 2012, she appeared opposite Isabelle Huppert in STC\u2019s production of Genet\u2019s The Maids and made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/08/the-present-review-cate-blanchett-antov-chekhov\">her Broadway debut in 2017 in Upton\u2019s version of Chekhov\u2019s Platonov</a>.</p> <p>The last time she was in London, it was in another Crimp text \u2013 a translation of the German playwright Botho Strauss\u2019s Big and Small. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/apr/15/big-and-small-billington\">It offered a white-knuckle portrait of a woman disintegrating before our eyes</a> \u2013 one second happily gossiping and flirting, the next keening and clawing the floor in anguish.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You always have to risk failure. The more recognisable you are, the harder it is to carve out that space</p> <footer> <cite>Cate Blanchett</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How on earth does she decide which roles will suit her? \u201cIf you read a work and you know what it is, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d bother rehearsing it,\u201d she replies crisply. \u201cYou always have to risk failure.

But you have to.\u201d</p> <p>Being among artists who challenge her is a powerful attraction, she adds, which is partly why this particular project was a no-brainer: \u201cI\u2019m not going to lock myself in a room for my own enjoyment or pain.

      "bodyText": "Cate Blanchett strides into the room and plomps herself down on the sofa. In front of us \u2013 this is meant to be lunch \u2013 a table is piled high with sandwiches, fruit, salads and a copy of the script she has spent all morning rehearsing. She prods at it with a finger, hooting with laughter. \u201cAny pointers?\u201d she asks. I glance across at the other sofa, where Martin Crimp, the playwright, is settling himself in. He gazes back impassively. This might be a joke; it might not. We\u2019re backstage at the National Theatre to discuss Blanchett\u2019s appearance in Crimp\u2019s new play \u2013 her debut here, and her first appearance on the London stage in seven years. Also squeezing on to the sofas are Blanchett\u2019s director, Katie Mitchell, and her co-star Stephen Dillane. To call the production hotly anticipated is something of an undersell: demand for tickets was so high that the theatre was forced to introduce a Hamilton-style ballot (a few day tickets are left, if you\u2019re able to queue). Even from the vantage point of not-quite-mid-January, this looks like being one of the biggest plays of the year. Working out what kind of play Crimp has come up with, however, is trickier, as Blanchett and her colleagues readily admit. Entitled When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other, it is \u2013 at least on paper \u2013 a loose adaptation of Samuel Richardson\u2019s 1740 proto-novel Pamela. Relating the story of a young maidservant\u2019s relationship with her employer, the book scandalised readers when it was first published. Composed of a series of letters in which Pamela relates how she is pursued by the mysterious \u201cMr B\u201d, then sexually assaulted, it ends with her finally (and apparently enthusiastically) agreeing to marry him. It\u2019s been called everything from tawdry S&amp;M to a set of case notes for Stockholm syndrome. \u201cIt\u2019s an archetypal story: Beauty and the Beast,\u201d says Crimp. \u201cOr, to be more blunt, predator and prey.\u201d In the play, the problems of the novel are sharpened. Although the characters played by Blanchett and Dillane often resemble Pamela and Mr B, at other times they seem to blur into each other, or transform into other people entirely. At the play\u2019s opening, the scenario seems grimly clear: Mr B is a bullying despot, Pamela his cowering victim. A few scenes in, however \u2013 there are 12 in all, each responding to a different fragment or aspect of the novel \u2013 the ground has begun to shift. Images of voyeurism and violence proliferate: is the audience being challenged, titillated, or both? Is, in fact, the woman controlling her master, rather than the other way around? Dillane says: \u201cThere\u2019s a line in the play, \u2018I took you \u2013 against your will \u2013 was it against your will? \u2013 jury\u2019s out.\u2019\u201d He pauses. \u201cThat\u2019s the question: who\u2019s doing what to whom?\u201d The script reminds Blanchett of the boundary-breaking writers Rachel Cusk and Maggie Nelson: \u201cA lot of the things the play brings up is stuff I\u2019ve been thinking about for a long time. The boundaries of gender, how language constantly fails us and confines us, keeps us in paradigms and frameworks which are frustrating and confounding.\u201d Mitchell doesn\u2019t want to reveal too much about what audiences will see when the lights go down \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s a spoiler!\u201d she laughs \u2013 but says the production will be set in the present day, not a periwig or petticoat in sight. \u201cNo Downton Abbey,\u201d she adds, in case anyone was expecting it. It isn\u2019t hard to see what might have attracted Blanchett to a part that requires such shape-shifting. Her breakthrough movie role as Elizabeth, two decades ago, showed an actor revelling in her ability to switch from vulnerability to imperiousness almost between frames. Since then, there have been epic movie franchises (Indiana Jones, a gaggle of Hobbits, Lord of the Rings) alongside independent releases; classy, elegant fare (Carol, The Aviator, Blue Jasmine \u2013 the latter two winning her Oscars) as well as kooky avant-garde shorts; and the film I\u2019m Not There, in which she played Bob Dylan. In some recent films \u2013 such as Manifesto, in which she played no fewer than 13 different roles, among them a power-dressed newsreader and a bearded homeless man \u2013 she seems to work through her entire repertoire in a matter of minutes. As a stage actor, too, Blanchett has been eager to take chances. In 2006, she put a burgeoning movie career on ice to move back to Australia and run Sydney Theatre Company with her husband, the playwright-screenwriter Andrew Upton. Though Blanchett stepped down from the co-directorship in 2012, she appeared opposite Isabelle Huppert in STC\u2019s production of Genet\u2019s The Maids and made her Broadway debut in 2017 in Upton\u2019s version of Chekhov\u2019s Platonov. The last time she was in London, it was in another Crimp text \u2013 a translation of the German playwright Botho Strauss\u2019s Big and Small. It offered a white-knuckle portrait of a woman disintegrating before our eyes \u2013 one second happily gossiping and flirting, the next keening and clawing the floor in anguish. How on earth does she decide which roles will suit her? \u201cIf you read a work and you know what it is, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d bother rehearsing it,\u201d she replies crisply. \u201cYou always have to risk failure. The more recognisable you are, the more expectation there is around you, the harder it is to carve out that space. But you have to.\u201d Being among artists who challenge her is a powerful attraction, she adds, which is partly why this particular project was a no-brainer: \u201cI\u2019m not going to lock myself in a room for my own enjoyment or pain. The process is really important.\u201d I\u2019m wondering how she and her colleagues are approaching the wider politics of this play about the relationship between a predatory, all-powerful man and a woman being employed as a sexual plaything. British theatre was quick to channel the impulses of the #MeToo movement, at least on stage. Blanchett has often spoken about the issue, and pursued it doggedly when she chaired the jury at last year\u2019s Cannes festival. Crimp points out that he began sketching the script three years ago. But Mitchell says, for her, the play can\u2019t really be about anything else, at least right now. \u201cOf course we think about it. It\u2019s a very live environment at the moment. It would be impossible not to.\u201d Blanchett is nodding passionately. \u201cYou make a piece for the time you\u2019re in, otherwise it\u2019s not relevant.

Is the Instagram generation ruining these locales? The short answer is it\u2019s a bit hysterical and, anyway, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2018/oct/08/ipcc-climate-change-report-urgent-action-fossil-fuels-live\">we\u2019re ruining the entire planet</a> so, as ever, there\u2019s something more worthy to fret over.</p> <p>But the longer answer: well, maybe Instagram <em>is</em> ruining some things.</p> <p>It is easy to lament<strong> </strong>the sensation of visiting places just for the \u2018gram as a sign of an increasingly self absorbed society at worst, and unoriginal at best. But we cannot just blame Instagram for these places being mauled by people. Instagram is just the natural progression of what was begun by Lonely Planet and then TripAdvisor \u2013 giving people a guaranteed AMAZING/ INCREDIBLE/ BEST EVER travel experience to brag to everyone at home about.</p> <p>As people have become wealthier and air travel more accessible, the world has grown smaller. It\u2019s not a a particularly revelatory observation to say we are travelling more but in the Instagram and TripAdvisor age what many people seem to have lost sight of is: travel can be a bit shit.</p> <p>There\u2019s the actual flight, the airline queues, paying $50 in your own currency for an incredibly ordinary breakfast, bad weather, boredom in art galleries, fatigue, sore feet, underwhelming iconic sites, enforced checkout times hours before you have to be somewhere, heavy luggage, dirty underwear, missing your bed; the list goes on.</p> <p>So why risk a bad Schweinebraten in Berlin when you can go to Clubrestaurant am Wannsee? TripAdvisor and Instagram may take some of the imagination out of travel but who has time to have imagination? We have an expectation of ourselves to wring the productivity out of every moment, even in our down time.</p> <p>People are hungry for social media to be evil, because if it\u2019s bad then it must be the reason for a lot of bad in our world \u2013 such as the rise of Nazis, rigged elections and a bone deep malaise, and not, say, human nature and late-stage capitalism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/06/hyams-beach-thousands-turned-away-as-nsw-tourism-hot-spot-loved-to-death\">Hyams beach: thousands turned away as NSW tourism hot spot 'loved to death'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I cannot say for sure whether Instagram, or social media for that matter, is a net good or a net bad because it probably isn\u2019t either.

My uncle said at Christmas that he feels like he has watched my son grow up over the year despite only actually getting to see him twice in that time.</p> <p>Those are good things about social media. The bad things are potentially manipulated<strong> </strong>elections through collusion with Russia, hefty personal data breaches and beautiful beaches becoming overwhelmed with tourists.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t seem a particularly balanced ledger upon close inspection but people are not going to stop using social media.

I have no scientific evidence but the rise of Gordons Bay has coincided with the rise of the phenomenon of \u201cgoing places for the \u2018gram\u201d. I suspect the bay\u2019s popularity may have something to do with that. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning People also seem unable to visit the McIver Women\u2019s Baths (as close to a spiritual place as I have ever experienced) or Icebergs in Bondi without declaring via Instagram they were there and it\u2019s still as attractive as the last time someone visited. But Gordons Bay has got off lightly it seems. Hyams beach village in Jervis Bay, which is said to have the world\u2019s whitest sand, has had to employ traffic controllers and turn people away as up to 5,000 cars per day try to visit a village with 400 car spaces. Why so suddenly popular? It\u2019s become a \u201csocial media phenomenon\u201d. In New Zealand people are queuing for up to an hour to create a photo that has the illusion of seclusion at one of the most spectacular spots in the photogenic country. A barely-known beach in Japan had 50,000 visitors in July and August last year as they sought a \u201cmirror-effect\u201d shot with the fiery dusk. There\u2019s an endless supply of articles bemoaning Instagram \u201cruining\u201d photography and even \u201cruining\u201d travel. Is the Instagram generation ruining these locales? The short answer is it\u2019s a bit hysterical and, anyway, we\u2019re ruining the entire planet so, as ever, there\u2019s something more worthy to fret over. But the longer answer: well, maybe Instagram is ruining some things. It is easy to lament the sensation of visiting places just for the \u2018gram as a sign of an increasingly self absorbed society at worst, and unoriginal at best. But we cannot just blame Instagram for these places being mauled by people. Instagram is just the natural progression of what was begun by Lonely Planet and then TripAdvisor \u2013 giving people a guaranteed AMAZING/ INCREDIBLE/ BEST EVER travel experience to brag to everyone at home about. As people have become wealthier and air travel more accessible, the world has grown smaller. It\u2019s not a a particularly revelatory observation to say we are travelling more but in the Instagram and TripAdvisor age what many people seem to have lost sight of is: travel can be a bit shit. There\u2019s the actual flight, the airline queues, paying $50 in your own currency for an incredibly ordinary breakfast, bad weather, boredom in art galleries, fatigue, sore feet, underwhelming iconic sites, enforced checkout times hours before you have to be somewhere, heavy luggage, dirty underwear, missing your bed; the list goes on. So why risk a bad Schweinebraten in Berlin when you can go to Clubrestaurant am Wannsee? TripAdvisor and Instagram may take some of the imagination out of travel but who has time to have imagination? We have an expectation of ourselves to wring the productivity out of every moment, even in our down time. People are hungry for social media to be evil, because if it\u2019s bad then it must be the reason for a lot of bad in our world \u2013 such as the rise of Nazis, rigged elections and a bone deep malaise, and not, say, human nature and late-stage capitalism. I cannot say for sure whether Instagram, or social media for that matter, is a net good or a net bad because it probably isn\u2019t either. Every morning many members of my family \u2013 my siblings, my parents, my cousins, my aunts and uncles \u2013 take a photo of wherever we are and send it to each other with GM written on it for \u201cgood morning\u201d. My uncle said at Christmas that he feels like he has watched my son grow up over the year despite only actually getting to see him twice in that time. Those are good things about social media. The bad things are potentially manipulated elections through collusion with Russia, hefty personal data breaches and beautiful beaches becoming overwhelmed with tourists. It doesn\u2019t seem a particularly balanced ledger upon close inspection but people are not going to stop using social media. Instagram could be ruining some beautiful places, but people have been ruining beautiful places on Earth since the beginning of time.",

The Scottish government is proposing to add two questions, posed on a voluntary basis, regarding gender identity and sexual orientation to the 2021 census, via the Census (Amendment) (Scotland) bill. Discussion has extended to the format of the sex question, which will be dealt with in secondary legislation. At present the question is a binary one, requiring a male or female answer. The Equality Network, which campaigns for LGBTI rights in Scotland, wants to see a third option to the male/female sex question, ideally offering a write-in box for individuals to define themselves using the terminology they prefer.

      "body": "<p>In the early hours of one morning, nearly a decade ago, chauffeur Jayne Amelia Larson found herself trying to extricate the son of one of the wealthiest men in Los Angeles from the back of her car. The then-chauffeur had been driving the twentysomething party boy up and down Santa Monica Boulevard in her Lincoln Town car as he tried to procure a \u201ctransvestite prostitute\u201d for his girlfriend who, he said, \u201cwanted to convert a gay guy\u201d. After several hours, he threw up on the back seat and fell into a drunken slumber, then woke up and tried to urinate in the car.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019d been in rehab again and again,\u201d says Larson, recalling the incident that took place just weeks into her new career. \u201cAnother driver I later met had been his family\u2019s driver, and said the kid repeatedly did stuff in the car you would not believe, like he went to the bathroom there because he was just so wasted. And I don\u2019t mean in a clean way; I mean in an awful way.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually, the chauffeuring firm she worked for directed her to one of the city\u2019s wealthiest neighbourhoods. But as she drove her client through the gates of a huge mansion, he panicked. \u201cHe kept saying: \u2018Nobody loves me. Please don\u2019t wake my parents. They hate me!\u2019\u201d As the car pulled up, an older man, who she presumes was a member of his parents\u2019 staff, stepped out from the darkness and helped him from the car. \u201cThe guy shushed him, and said: \u2018You\u2019re home. It\u2019s OK now.\u2019 It was just so weird and terrible and odd.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a97f2a0929d3b54e142de58b9c93f54e56abca2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a97f2a0929d3b54e142de58b9c93f54e56abca2b/954_0_2336_2336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jayne Amelia Larson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jayne Amelia Larson, who turned her experience of working as a chauffeur for a Saudi royal into a play and a book</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Larson\u2019s experience is not as extraordinary as it might seem. Behind the tinted windows of luxury cars, chauffeurs have an insight into a world few people will see \u2013 the private, intimate space of the rich and famous. In a profession where personal referrals are important, discretion is taken seriously. But when drivers break this code, the results can be explosive.</p> <p>I spoke to chauffeurs in the UK and US who recalled disturbing incidents involving VIP clients, from scoring drugs to having sex on the back seats. Last month, the former personal driver to the multimillionaire and Conservative donor Christopher Moran told the Sunday Times that he had been aware that there were \u201cat least a hundred prostitutes\u201d operating from the Chelsea Cloisters apartment block owned by his former boss. Tony Heaney, who drove Moran\u2019s Rolls-Royce for 25 years, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/christopher-morans-driver-we-all-knew-prostitutes-worked-in-chelsea-cloisters-zb3hdm53w\" title=\"\">told the paper</a> he used to check the bins in the flats for condoms to tot up \u201cexactly how many girls were working there\u201d. The retired chauffeur told the paper he was upset after Moran allegedly failed to thank him when he left the job. Moran denied he knew the extent of the problem and his management took a \u201czero tolerance\u201d approach to sex work in the building.</p> <p>Harvey Weinstein\u2019s ex-chauffeur also went public with allegations about his former employer, saying the disgraced mogul had sex in the back of his car with a woman who begged the producer \u201cnot to hurt her\u201d (Weinstein has denied the allegations). Jacques Chirac\u2019s former driver, meanwhile, wrote a book claiming his boss had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/19/books.booksnews\" title=\"\">a serial philanderer</a>.</p> <p>Chauffeuring can be well paid. The annual salary for personal chauffeurs for executives and super-rich families in London averages between \u00a335,000 and \u00a360,000, according to Irving Scott, an upmarket household staffing agency. Drivers, it says, can expect bonuses for commitment, longevity and loyalty, with discretion and professional secrecy also financially rewarded. Other agencies advertise jobs such as a \u00a335,000-a-year permanent role based in Knightsbridge, London, that includes maintaining the client\u2019s \u201clarge collection of supercars and other luxury vehicles including a Rolls-Royce, a Bentley and an armoured Mercedes S class\u201d; and a \u00a340,000-a-year permanent role with a family split between London and a villa in the south of France, with duties also including security, supervising contractors, keeping the exterior of the property empty and putting out deckchairs.</p> <p>Yet for all the apparent glamour, the exacting nature of chauffeuring VIP clients was exposed last summer when it was alleged that Sir Martin Sorrell, the former chief executive of British advertising giant WPP, had suddenly sacked his personal driver of 15 years in October 2017. The unnamed driver was reportedly asked, at 2am, to pick up Lady Cristiana Sorrell from the exclusive Mayfair restaurant Isabel. The driver then refused to resume work at 7am, explaining he would be too tired to drive safely if he only got two or three hours\u2019 sleep. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/11/martin-sorrells-wpp-exit-came-amid-bullying-and-sex-worker-allegations\" title=\"\">paper claimed the Sorrells fired him</a> the next day.</p> <p>It is impossible to put a total value on the UK\u2019s chauffeuring industry, which, at the top end, includes personal drivers, luxury hotel car services and small and large firms. According to Transport for London, there were more than 12,000 executive-class private hire vehicles \u2013 Mercedes E, S and Viano series \u2013 less than five years old in the capital in June 2017. Paul Gibson, editor of <a href=\"http://www.thechauffeur.com/\" title=\"\">TheChauffeur.com</a>, says that, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of companies providing security chauffeurs, with close-protection training for executives, celebrities and super-rich clients. These chauffeurs are often at the high end of the earning bracket thanks to specialist qualifications such as defensive driving, as shown in the BBC drama The Bodyguard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6b793bd2363b5171b1967bf9dae70baa4ffdb4e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b793bd2363b5171b1967bf9dae70baa4ffdb4e2/0_200_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Bowmont and Henry Newton of Capstar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charles Bowmont and Henry Newton of Capstar, which recruits ex-forces personnel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the best known of these companies is <a href=\"http://www.capstar.co/about-us/\" title=\"\">Capstar</a>, founded by two former British army officers, Robert Bassett Cross and Charles Bowmont, in 2012. The Brentford-based company began with a mission to recruit ex-forces personnel, included those wounded in action in Iraq and Afghanistan. But Capstar has evolved into a lifestyle and security management service, helping clients with their private club membership or buying fine art and jewellery.</p> <p>Bowmont, a Sandhurst graduate, is well placed to understand his clients\u2019 needs. A Swiss billionaire\u2019s family, who required a very personal round-the-clock service to manage their daily schedule, are described as close personal friends. \u201cI\u2019d get a WhatsApp message from her going: \u2018Right, my husband can\u2019t take the children to school tomorrow, can you get the guys out?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When Larson first became a chauffeur, however, unusually, she had no experience of private driving. The Harvard graduate had moved to California to pursue acting and producing. Years later, after months without work, she was persuaded to start chauffeuring by a friend, with the idea that she would have lots of free time to pursue telephone and film projects, and earn enough in tips to help clear her $40,000 debts. Initially hired by a high-end limo company to chauffeur film stars, rock groups and Hollywood moguls to showbiz events including the Golden Globes and the Oscars, she soon discovered the business was all-consuming, with some jobs lasting up to 17 hours.</p> <p>But the demands of her celebrity clients paled in comparison with those of the Saudi royals Larson worked for after driving for a couple of months. She was one of 40 drivers hired for seven weeks, with no days off, who were to be on call 24/7 for Princess Zaahira (not her real name), her children, the family\u2019s security and their entourage and staff \u2013 including nannies, personal assistants and domestic servants. Larson subsequently wrote a play and a book, <a href=\"https://www.jayneamelialarson.com/books.html\" title=\"\">Driving the Saudis</a>, about her experiences.</p> <p>Among the most challenging of Larson\u2019s tasks was finding 27 bottles of a particular brand of hair-removal cream late one night, after a 12-hour shift. She went to 20 shops all over LA County and grabbed every bottle she could find. \u201cBut when I got back, I was dismissed by the princess\u2019s secretary, who said: \u201cOh, it\u2019s too late.\u201d On another occasion, she was charged with picking up one of Princess Zaahira\u2019s best friends at a plastic surgery clinic in Beverly Hills. Larson had to wait for hours outside before a nurse discharged the fiftysomething patient, but the woman, who was recovering after having buttock implants, promptly lost consciousness. A flummoxed Larson then had to recruit a group of nearby valets to help her lift the woman into the back of the SUV.</p> <p>\u201cWithin a few days of not eating, not sleeping, of chaos, of the complete contradiction of orders on a minute-by-minute basis, I just realised that the goal here is to survive,\u201d she says. \u201cThe royal family and the upper echelon of the staff liked to keep chaos around them to keep you on your toes. And the servants were happy to let you do stuff that they would otherwise have been asked to do by the family.\u201d</p> <p>Due to her gender and inexperience, Larson was at the bottom of the pecking order of the family\u2019s entourage and the fleet of drivers. She says the princess\u2019s hairdresser bullied and verbally abused her after she was assigned to drive him, offended to be relegated to a female driver of the least luxurious car in the motorcade, a Ford Crown Victoria. Yet she ingratiated herself with Princess Zaahira by recounting tales from the royal entourage\u2019s nightly exploits at casinos, which tradition and decorum dictated that a Saudi princess could not attend. \u201cI would do these little pantomimes for her,\u201d says Larson. \u201cShe\u2019d laugh and laugh. I\u2019m sure it was because my accent was horrendous, but also because she was appreciating that I got a bit of the nuance of all the characters, especially the hairdresser. I felt as if I was floating on a little cloud around her.\u201d</p> <p>She was assigned more luxurious cars and felt she was getting somewhere until the relatively paltry $1,000 tip she received at the end of the seven weeks disabused her. \u201cIt was about a fifth of the amount that the other \u2013 male \u2013 drivers received, after I had done far more work.\u201d Her basic wage was also underwhelming, given her long hours. \u201cA friend of mine figured out it was about $11 [\u00a38.60] an hour, and I remember him saying: \u2018Well, that\u2019s not that bad.\u2019 And I said: \u2018For an 18-hour day?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2c6fe17a6d3cd14fac7cdbf59784061536ff9ded\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c6fe17a6d3cd14fac7cdbf59784061536ff9ded/1099_0_1609_1609/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gerold Wunstel, who has spent 24 years as a chauffeur\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gerold Wunstel, who has spent 24 years as a chauffeur</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gerold Wunstel, a chauffeur who has driven European government ministers in his native Germany and Hollywood stars in Los Angeles during his 24-year career, says those new to the business can get carried away by their proximity to VIP clients. \u201cYou think you\u2019re part of the entourage,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re just the bloody chauffeur. Dave Stewart, of the Eurythmics, invited me in to his birthday party. I said no, because I\u2019m not his friend, I\u2019m a professional. You\u2019re not supposed to mingle with Elvis Costello or whoever\u2019s invited.\u201d</p> <p>Wunstel, who most recently worked as the senior driver for the LA Philharmonic, recalls how a rich Saudi businessman he chauffeured around San Francisco and the Napa valley wine region challenged this. \u201cWe hit it off because he was educated in Switzerland and London, and spoke fluent German,\u201d he says. But the client\u2019s love of marijuana tested their relationship. At the beginning of the job, Wunstel drove the man to Haight-Ashbury, where San Francisco dealers hung out. \u201cI had to tell him not to tip the drug dealers,\u201d he says. After four days, Wunstel refused to go to the area again. \u201cI had to say: \u2018I\u2019m really sorry but it\u2019s too dangerous,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m a new guy in this country. I just got a green card. If the police stop me with some marijuana, I\u2019m in big trouble.\u2019 Which wasn\u2019t necessarily true, but I was not his drug mule.\u201d</p> <p>His worst-behaved client was a billionaire. \u201cI picked him up from a private airfield and he took a helicopter instead of walking 200 metres to the car,\u201d says Wunstel. \u201cWith a stretch limo you have a divider, so you are supposed to not hear anything, but you hear everything. He had sex with a model while I was driving. No class, no manners. He gave me a $100 tip, but that\u2019s not the point.\u201d</p> <p>Wunstel has driven stars including Bill Murray, George Clooney and Eminem. But he says driving celebrities can be more hassle than it\u2019s worth. \u201cYou have to be at the office four hours before because you don\u2019t know when they are touching down in their private plane, and you don\u2019t get paid extra. And, you know, some celebrities do not tip. The more experience I got, the more I realised I just like to drive \u2018regular\u2019 people, such as boring lawyers or real-estate guys. You go from one meeting to another and work 10 hours in a stretch, and you get paid.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7902f010705e4e05860d7740774ea733597b8c42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7902f010705e4e05860d7740774ea733597b8c42/0_249_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manny Qorrolli and Ervin Gjoni of EG Chauffeurs in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manny Qorrolli and Ervin Gjoni of EG Chauffeurs in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ervin Gjoni, managing director of EG Chauffeurs, based in Westminster, in central London, agrees.

      "bodyText": "In the early hours of one morning, nearly a decade ago, chauffeur Jayne Amelia Larson found herself trying to extricate the son of one of the wealthiest men in Los Angeles from the back of her car. The then-chauffeur had been driving the twentysomething party boy up and down Santa Monica Boulevard in her Lincoln Town car as he tried to procure a \u201ctransvestite prostitute\u201d for his girlfriend who, he said, \u201cwanted to convert a gay guy\u201d. After several hours, he threw up on the back seat and fell into a drunken slumber, then woke up and tried to urinate in the car. \u201cHe\u2019d been in rehab again and again,\u201d says Larson, recalling the incident that took place just weeks into her new career. \u201cAnother driver I later met had been his family\u2019s driver, and said the kid repeatedly did stuff in the car you would not believe, like he went to the bathroom there because he was just so wasted. And I don\u2019t mean in a clean way; I mean in an awful way.\u201d Eventually, the chauffeuring firm she worked for directed her to one of the city\u2019s wealthiest neighbourhoods. But as she drove her client through the gates of a huge mansion, he panicked. \u201cHe kept saying: \u2018Nobody loves me. Please don\u2019t wake my parents. They hate me!\u2019\u201d As the car pulled up, an older man, who she presumes was a member of his parents\u2019 staff, stepped out from the darkness and helped him from the car. \u201cThe guy shushed him, and said: \u2018You\u2019re home. It\u2019s OK now.\u2019 It was just so weird and terrible and odd.\u201d Larson\u2019s experience is not as extraordinary as it might seem. Behind the tinted windows of luxury cars, chauffeurs have an insight into a world few people will see \u2013 the private, intimate space of the rich and famous. In a profession where personal referrals are important, discretion is taken seriously. But when drivers break this code, the results can be explosive. I spoke to chauffeurs in the UK and US who recalled disturbing incidents involving VIP clients, from scoring drugs to having sex on the back seats. Last month, the former personal driver to the multimillionaire and Conservative donor Christopher Moran told the Sunday Times that he had been aware that there were \u201cat least a hundred prostitutes\u201d operating from the Chelsea Cloisters apartment block owned by his former boss. Tony Heaney, who drove Moran\u2019s Rolls-Royce for 25 years, told the paper he used to check the bins in the flats for condoms to tot up \u201cexactly how many girls were working there\u201d. The retired chauffeur told the paper he was upset after Moran allegedly failed to thank him when he left the job. Moran denied he knew the extent of the problem and his management took a \u201czero tolerance\u201d approach to sex work in the building. Harvey Weinstein\u2019s ex-chauffeur also went public with allegations about his former employer, saying the disgraced mogul had sex in the back of his car with a woman who begged the producer \u201cnot to hurt her\u201d (Weinstein has denied the allegations). Jacques Chirac\u2019s former driver, meanwhile, wrote a book claiming his boss had been a serial philanderer. Chauffeuring can be well paid. The annual salary for personal chauffeurs for executives and super-rich families in London averages between \u00a335,000 and \u00a360,000, according to Irving Scott, an upmarket household staffing agency. Drivers, it says, can expect bonuses for commitment, longevity and loyalty, with discretion and professional secrecy also financially rewarded. Other agencies advertise jobs such as a \u00a335,000-a-year permanent role based in Knightsbridge, London, that includes maintaining the client\u2019s \u201clarge collection of supercars and other luxury vehicles including a Rolls-Royce, a Bentley and an armoured Mercedes S class\u201d; and a \u00a340,000-a-year permanent role with a family split between London and a villa in the south of France, with duties also including security, supervising contractors, keeping the exterior of the property empty and putting out deckchairs. Yet for all the apparent glamour, the exacting nature of chauffeuring VIP clients was exposed last summer when it was alleged that Sir Martin Sorrell, the former chief executive of British advertising giant WPP, had suddenly sacked his personal driver of 15 years in October 2017. The unnamed driver was reportedly asked, at 2am, to pick up Lady Cristiana Sorrell from the exclusive Mayfair restaurant Isabel. The driver then refused to resume work at 7am, explaining he would be too tired to drive safely if he only got two or three hours\u2019 sleep. The paper claimed the Sorrells fired him the next day. It is impossible to put a total value on the UK\u2019s chauffeuring industry, which, at the top end, includes personal drivers, luxury hotel car services and small and large firms. According to Transport for London, there were more than 12,000 executive-class private hire vehicles \u2013 Mercedes E, S and Viano series \u2013 less than five years old in the capital in June 2017. Paul Gibson, editor of TheChauffeur.com, says that, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of companies providing security chauffeurs, with close-protection training for executives, celebrities and super-rich clients. These chauffeurs are often at the high end of the earning bracket thanks to specialist qualifications such as defensive driving, as shown in the BBC drama The Bodyguard. One of the best known of these companies is Capstar, founded by two former British army officers, Robert Bassett Cross and Charles Bowmont, in 2012. The Brentford-based company began with a mission to recruit ex-forces personnel, included those wounded in action in Iraq and Afghanistan. But Capstar has evolved into a lifestyle and security management service, helping clients with their private club membership or buying fine art and jewellery. Bowmont, a Sandhurst graduate, is well placed to understand his clients\u2019 needs. A Swiss billionaire\u2019s family, who required a very personal round-the-clock service to manage their daily schedule, are described as close personal friends. \u201cI\u2019d get a WhatsApp message from her going: \u2018Right, my husband can\u2019t take the children to school tomorrow, can you get the guys out?\u2019\u201d When Larson first became a chauffeur, however, unusually, she had no experience of private driving. The Harvard graduate had moved to California to pursue acting and producing. Years later, after months without work, she was persuaded to start chauffeuring by a friend, with the idea that she would have lots of free time to pursue telephone and film projects, and earn enough in tips to help clear her $40,000 debts. Initially hired by a high-end limo company to chauffeur film stars, rock groups and Hollywood moguls to showbiz events including the Golden Globes and the Oscars, she soon discovered the business was all-consuming, with some jobs lasting up to 17 hours. But the demands of her celebrity clients paled in comparison with those of the Saudi royals Larson worked for after driving for a couple of months. She was one of 40 drivers hired for seven weeks, with no days off, who were to be on call 24/7 for Princess Zaahira (not her real name), her children, the family\u2019s security and their entourage and staff \u2013 including nannies, personal assistants and domestic servants. Larson subsequently wrote a play and a book, Driving the Saudis, about her experiences. Among the most challenging of Larson\u2019s tasks was finding 27 bottles of a particular brand of hair-removal cream late one night, after a 12-hour shift. She went to 20 shops all over LA County and grabbed every bottle she could find. \u201cBut when I got back, I was dismissed by the princess\u2019s secretary, who said: \u201cOh, it\u2019s too late.\u201d On another occasion, she was charged with picking up one of Princess Zaahira\u2019s best friends at a plastic surgery clinic in Beverly Hills.

      "bodyText": "Andy Murray Age 31 Ranking 230 Seeding N/A Uncertainty hangs over the former world No 1, who has struggled to return to his physical peak after hip surgery. These are difficult times for Murray and although the five-times Australian Open finalist could be a dangerous first\u2011round opponent for a seeded player, it was troubling to hear him express concerns over his future after losing to Daniil Medvedev in Brisbane last week. It remains to be seen how far he can push his body over the course of five sets. Kyle Edmund Age 24 Ranking 14 Seeding 13 Murray\u2019s fitness problems have increased the pressure on Edmund and the British No 1 will be under the microscope after his stirring run to last year\u2019s semi-finals. Dealing with heightened expectations will not be easy for this shy young man. However Edmund has made smooth progress under his Swedish coach, Fredrik Rosengren, and his devastating forehand will give him a chance against anyone. It would be unwise to read too much into a rusty defeat to Yasutaka Uchiyama, the world No 163, in Brisbane. Cameron Norrie Age 23 Ranking 93 Seeding N/A The left-hander is looking to maintain his progress after breaking into the top 100. Norrie enjoyed a good win over Beno\u00eet Paire in Auckland \u2013 where he grew up \u2013 and will be determined to make the most of his first appearance in the main draw at the Australian Open. Johanna Konta Age 27 Ranking 38 Seeding N/A Britain\u2019s best woman fell down the rankings last year and ended up splitting with her coach, the American Michael Joyce, after failing to replicate the highs of 2017. Last season was difficult for Konta, who must prove that she was no flash in the pan. Konta has a new coach, the Frenchman Dimitri Zavialoff, and the 2016 Australian Open semi-finalist was feeling good about her game after beating Sloane Stephens in Brisbane. However, her withdrawal from the Sydney Open was a concern. Heather Watson Age 26 Ranking 93 Seeding N/A Watson has made it out of the first round in Melbourne on only two occasions and her recent grand slam form does not inspire confidence. The 26-year-old has also had a sticky start to the year, losing to Marta Kostyuk in qualifying for Brisbane and Irina-Camelia Begu in the first round at Hobart. The player who almost stunned Serena Williams at Wimbledon four years ago is rarely seen these days. Katie Boulter Age 22 Ranking 99 Seeding N/A Boulter\u2019s first task this year is to hold on to her place in the top 100. That will provide her with a solid platform to keep improving. Boulter has already had a taste of grand slam action, beating Ver\u00f3nica Cepede Royg before losing to Naomi Osaka at Wimbledon last year, and she will savour her first appearance in the main draw at the Australian Open. British players in qualifiers Dan Evans Age 28 Ranking 190 Seeding N/A A talent that promised so much has rather fizzled out in the past 18 months.

He barely played a match of any note in 2018 and has not featured in a grand slam since a first-round defeat to Marcos Baghdatis 18 months ago. Ward battled back from a set down to defeat home favourite Maverick Banes in the first round of qualifying which set up a meeting in the next stage with Argentinian Marco Trungelliti.

      "body": "<h2>RIGHT SAID DANIEL</h2> <p>Tottenham Hotspur have a long and grand musical tradition stretching all the way back to the early 1960s, when they became the first English club side to appropriate the US marching song John Brown\u2019s Body and started banging on about glory, glory. Then there was the 1973 single Nice One Cyril, a celebration of left back Cyril Knowles that earned songwriters Helen Clarke and Harold Spiro an Ivor Novello Award, for goodness sake. And of course we all love the great rockney triptych Ossie\u2019s Dream, Tottenham Tottenham, and When The Year Ends In One by the popular pub-singalong trio Chas, Dave &amp; The Drummer From Chas \u2018n\u2019 Dave. (Hot Shot Tottenham, if you even remember it, barely qualifies as a deep cut.) Overall, Tottenham\u2019s contribution to the English folk canon is one everyone involved can be extremely proud of.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/that-1980s-sports-blog/2019/jan/09/spurs-white-hart-lane-stadium-tottenham-spurs\">When building chaos kept Spurs out of White Hart Lane ... 30 seasons ago</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it\u2019s the dawning of a new era, and they\u2019ll need something fresh to run out to at the New Artisan Cheese Facility. The Fiver suggests they look no further than the discography of Bernard Cribbins. The former Norwich and Manchester United defender, due to take over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/02/steve-bruce-confirmed-as-new-manager-of-sheffield-wednesday\">as manager of Sheffield Wednesday</a> next month, had a couple of smash-hit records back in the day, and either would capture the very essence of the modern Tottenham Hotspur. Right Said Fred tells the story of two interior designers systematically demolishing a building in their increasingly incompetent attempts to shift an awkward piece of furniture; Hole In The Ground essays the hapless travails of a civil engineer digging some foundations to incorrect specifications. Yes, this is our pitifully contrived way of saying, on a very slow news day, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/09/tottenham-new-stadium-mid-march-earliest-delay-football\">the new gaff\u2019s been delayed again</a>.</p> <p>Reasons for the latest setback haven\u2019t been announced. Perhaps half a ton of rubble landed on Fred\u2019s head upon giving the ceiling a mighty blow with his crowbar, or maybe a trench was dug round when it ought to be square. Or it could be that Mauricio Pochettino keeps turning up on site, absolutely raging, and ripping out all the wiring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/09/maurizio-sarri-unhappy-var-chelsea-loss-spurs\">for the VAR equipment</a>. The Fiver\u2019s uncharacteristically light on details. But we do know that Spurs will now be forced to play their next four home league fixtures, including the visit of Arsenal, at Wembley, a sequence taking them into March when the new place was supposed to open last August. \u201cI should like to apologise to blah fans blah continued patience blah commitment to deliver an exceptional matchday experience,\u201d cut-and-pasted chief suit Daniel Levy from the press release issued the last time Spurs did this.

      "bodyText": "RIGHT SAID DANIEL Tottenham Hotspur have a long and grand musical tradition stretching all the way back to the early 1960s, when they became the first English club side to appropriate the US marching song John Brown\u2019s Body and started banging on about glory, glory. Then there was the 1973 single Nice One Cyril, a celebration of left back Cyril Knowles that earned songwriters Helen Clarke and Harold Spiro an Ivor Novello Award, for goodness sake. And of course we all love the great rockney triptych Ossie\u2019s Dream, Tottenham Tottenham, and When The Year Ends In One by the popular pub-singalong trio Chas, Dave &amp; The Drummer From Chas \u2018n\u2019 Dave. (Hot Shot Tottenham, if you even remember it, barely qualifies as a deep cut.) Overall, Tottenham\u2019s contribution to the English folk canon is one everyone involved can be extremely proud of. But it\u2019s the dawning of a new era, and they\u2019ll need something fresh to run out to at the New Artisan Cheese Facility. The Fiver suggests they look no further than the discography of Bernard Cribbins. The former Norwich and Manchester United defender, due to take over as manager of Sheffield Wednesday next month, had a couple of smash-hit records back in the day, and either would capture the very essence of the modern Tottenham Hotspur. Right Said Fred tells the story of two interior designers systematically demolishing a building in their increasingly incompetent attempts to shift an awkward piece of furniture; Hole In The Ground essays the hapless travails of a civil engineer digging some foundations to incorrect specifications. Yes, this is our pitifully contrived way of saying, on a very slow news day, that the new gaff\u2019s been delayed again. Reasons for the latest setback haven\u2019t been announced. Perhaps half a ton of rubble landed on Fred\u2019s head upon giving the ceiling a mighty blow with his crowbar, or maybe a trench was dug round when it ought to be square. Or it could be that Mauricio Pochettino keeps turning up on site, absolutely raging, and ripping out all the wiring for the VAR equipment. The Fiver\u2019s uncharacteristically light on details. But we do know that Spurs will now be forced to play their next four home league fixtures, including the visit of Arsenal, at Wembley, a sequence taking them into March when the new place was supposed to open last August. \u201cI should like to apologise to blah fans blah continued patience blah commitment to deliver an exceptional matchday experience,\u201d cut-and-pasted chief suit Daniel Levy from the press release issued the last time Spurs did this. Then he had another cup of tea and went home. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Jacob Steinberg from 7.45pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Manchester City 6-0 Burton in the Fizzy Cup semi-finals, first leg. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI have read and heard his recollection of our telephone conversations and have given them the credit they deserve and promptly dispatched them into the bin\u201d \u2013 Bolton chief suit Ken Owen takes the high road in the club\u2019s dispute with Forest Green Rovers after the collapse of Christian Doidge\u2019s proposed move there \u2013 read more here. SUPPORT THE GUARDIAN Producing the Guardian\u2019s thoughtful, in-depth journalism [the stuff not normally found in this email, obviously \u2013 Fiver Ed] is expensive, but supporting us isn\u2019t. If you value our journalism, please support us. In return we can hopefully arm you with the kind of knowledge that makes you sound slightly less uninformed during those hot reactive gegenpress chats you so enjoy. And if you think what we do is enjoyable [again, etc and so on \u2013 Fiver Ed], please help us keep coming back here to give you more of the same. FIVER LETTERS \u201cRe: Marten Allen\u2019s experience at St James\u2019 Park [Tuesday\u2019s Fiver], there\u2019s this seat at Goodison. From my Evertonian point of view, they\u2019re not missing much\u201d \u2013 Andrew Quinlan. \u201cIn response to Marten Allen\u2019s observation about the visitors\u2019 section at St James\u2019 Park, for future reference, there is a lift that will take you to the upper reaches. However on my most recent visit, it was guarded by an attendant who said it was only intended for people \u2018who really need to use it\u2019. My reply that, having been there before, I knew that I really needed to use it fell on deaf ears\u201d \u2013 Joseph Costello. \u201cIncontrovertibly, my worst away end experience was taking my West Ham-supporting son to see them play Millwall at The Old Den. To be fair, the view from the uncovered terrace was good, but the ground was squalid, and the experience terrifying. As a Manchester United fan myself, I once had the misfortune to sit near the back of Old Trafford\u2019s North Stand, which is a dismal waste of \u00a338\u201d \u2013 Steve Allen. \u201cMay I nominate Brighton\u2019s former Withdean ground as the worst away experience in footballing history. Up to \u00a330 to sit in an uncovered row of temporary seating some 40 metres from the pitch at the far end of the ground. The club now import the away team\u2019s local beer to sell at the Amex to make up for it\u201d \u2013 Thomas Atkins. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Thomas Atkins. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Luton\u2019s Nathan Jones has jumped into the Gary Rowett-shaped hole in Stoke\u2019s dugout after the clubs agreed a compensation package for the 45-year-old manager, prompting a certain member of Fiver Towers to go on a Bananarama-bonanza. Les Bleurgh full-back Benjamin Pavard will join Bayern Munich in the summer after the German champions agreed to deposit \u00a331.4m in Stuttgart\u2019s piggy bank. \u201cHe is a very interesting player,\u201d parped sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic. Perhaps because he hasn\u2019t looked at Liverpool\u2019s away form in Europe, Arjen Robben says Bayern Munich are quaking in their boots at the prospect of taking on J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side. \u201cFor us, it was perhaps the worst possible draw,\u201d he yelped. \u201cAnd I also see them as a favourite for the [Big Cup].\u201d Mohamed Salah was coerced into doing an awkward dad-dance on stage with Youssou N\u2019Dour after winning back-to-back Africa Player of the Year gongs. \u201cI have dreamt of winning this award since I was a child and now I have done so twice in a row,\u201d cheered the goal-guzzling Liverpool forward. And Everton\u2019s chief suit, Denise Barrett-Baxendale, said the club should be challenging for the Premier League title when they move to their new stadium. \u201cIt means challenging for domestic titles and trophies,\u201d she roared. \u201cNot only to win cups but to win Premier League titles too.\u201d STILL WANT MORE? Has a goalkeeper ever been hooked for being bobbins? You asked and The Knowledge delivered (loads and loads and loads of them). Turns out Spurs have history of stadium chaos, as Steven Pye remembers. Ben Fisher casts his eye over 10 of the best teenagers in the Football League, just in case German clubs need any more UK-based whelps. Harry Kane is really, really good at spanking the ball into the goal \u2026 and other things Barney Ronay learned from watching Spurs beat Chelsea. But mostly that. Gary Crosby talks Googling himself, heading the ball out of Andy Dibble\u2019s hands, annoying Lord Ferg \u2026 oh, and how he\u2019ll pit his wits against Pep Guardiola as Burton\u2019s assistant manager.

This is the question facing liberal democracies across the world as Russia and others exploit free speech and its institutions \u2013 especially traditional and social media \u2013 through misinformation and electoral interference. Russia\u2019s information manipulation strategies are many and varied, and far more sophisticated than simply pushing out pro-Putin messages. It uses a mix of Russian-owned media outlets, most notably RT (formerly Russia Today) and Sputnik, sympathetic talking heads, social media \u201cbot\u201d accounts and state-sponsored hackers to influence western politics and media coverage. The aim is rarely to push out one single message, but rather to diminish trust in western institutions, destabilise countries or counter narratives that would be unhelpful to Russia. When a Russian-backed militia group shot down the Malaysia Airlines passenger plane MH17, killing 298 people, its media offered numerous different \u2013 and contradictory \u2013 explanations. When the Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with a nerve agent in Salisbury, Russian-backed outlets and supporters threw question after question to cast doubt on the official narrative and muddy it up. Such tactics only work in free societies, where doubt and debate are encouraged, and in which mainstream outlets encourage a broad range of voices: arguably the most successful information operation Russia has ever launched was the hacking of John Podesta and the Democratic National Committee\u2019s emails. This operation relied on WikiLeaks to publish the emails, and on mainstream outlets to find them irresistible and bring them to a much larger audience \u2013 which they did: Fox News ran them for weeks. Like a virus that turns its host\u2019s immune system against itself, Russia\u2019s information strategy works by turning free media and free speech against its own society. This makes countering such information warfare an especially difficult and delicate task. A cautionary tale in just how difficult this can be, and how easily it can backfire, can be found in a pan-European effort called the Integrity Initiative.

The trouble began when fringe UK leftwing blogs, soon followed by Sputnik and RT, noticed the group\u2019s Twitter account had retweeted a small number of articles critical of Jeremy Corbyn. Given the organisation receives funding from the UK government, this kind of political attack was inappropriate and ill-advised. But soon it had morphed into something much more sinister: Labour politician Chris Williamson called for a parliamentary inquiry into the group, saying its agenda appeared to include the \u201cdenigration of the Labour party and Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. What happened next would surprise few Russia watchers. As with so many others who might oppose Russia\u2019s agenda, the Integrity Initiative found itself the victim of a hacking attack, and had its internal documents anonymously posted online. As I landed after a six-hour flight with no internet during a December weekend, I discovered a number of British leftwing activists and then WikiLeaks (where I briefly worked from 2010 to 2011), with its 5.4 million Twitter followers, had discovered my name among a group of journalists named in the leaked files. My name was present as I had given a one-hour training talk on verifying online information to a group of international journalists at the Frontline Club in London, for which I was paid \u00a3225. As the talk had been co-organised by the Integrity Initiative, its agenda was published online, with the names of everyone who had spoken there.

Never mind that the documents show nothing of the sort \u2013 that is now the narrative that will mark any future efforts by the Integrity Initiative.

If we are to tackle Russian-backed misinformation \u2013 and to restore trust in our institutions, we must \u2013 we can\u2019t do it by trying to beat them at their own game. If efforts involve government funding, this should be openly declared, and every penny publicly accounted for. Every participant in the efforts should be named. Each tactic should be publicly declared. Wherever something happens behind the scenes, it will be exploited as a secret, or a \u201cpsyop\u201d, once it is inevitably exposed months later in a hack. Working largely from the shadows, Russia has co-opted our information ecosystem. Confronting it will have to be done in the open. \u2022 James Ball is the author of Post-Truth: How Bullshit Conquered the World",

Frans Meijer is on trial after being shot and arrested last October following an altercation with a police officer who had been alerted by residents to the suspicious behaviour of two men near a security van carrying cash. The court heard on Wednesday that Meijer, who was wearing a fake moustache and had a stolen van nearby, was armed and carrying two bulletproof vests and a device to jam mobile phone signals, when approached. He threatened the officer but was shot several times as he fled the scene in the Staatsliedenbuurt district of Amsterdam, the court heard. Meijer\u2019s 26-year-old son gave himself up. A third suspect appearing in court for a first appearance relating to the charges was Laurens Boellaard, 35, the son of a second Heineken kidnapper, Jan Boellaard. All three men deny the charges. Boellaard was released on bail for the duration of the trial while Meijer and his son remain in custody. Heineken was one of the richest people in the Netherlands and chairman and chief executive of the family brewing company when he and his driver, Ab Doderer, were kidnapped on 9 November 1983 outside the firm\u2019s offices in Amsterdam. As the kidnappers sought a \u00a315m ransom, Meijer\u2019s daily job was to feed the two men, who were tethered to a wall in a hut on an Amsterdam business park. Meijer would tell drinkers on leaving his favourite pub every dinnertime that he was \u201cgoing to give Heineken something to eat\u201d, comments erroneously thought to have been a joke about the story that was dominating the news. On 30 November, the men were released in exchange for 35m Dutch guilders (\u00a315.7m), in what was the highest ransom ever paid at the time. The ransom given to the kidnappers was not recovered in full. Heineken died, aged 78, in 2002. The kidnappers \u2013 Meijer, Boellaard and William Holleeder, who is currently on trial in The Hague over unconnected cases of murder, manslaughter and attempted murder \u2013 fled on being paid their money.

The players went on strike briefly in the summer when their wages were not paid on time, suppliers have been left unpaid for long periods, and the EFL has imposed a transfer embargo. Yet Bolton\u2019s accounts for the League One year, to 30 June 2017, show that Anderson was paid \u00a3525,000 in consultancy fees, and a further \u00a3125,000 consultancy fee was paid to a company owned by an Anderson family member. With Holdsworth\u2019s original \u00a34m loan still needing to be repaid, in September Anderson borrowed \u00a35m \u2013 from Eddie Davies, just days before Davies died. The EFL\u2019s new policy for owners and directors is intended to enable sanctions against individuals who are not barred by the narrow \u201cfit and proper person test\u201d due to a criminal conviction, involvement in two football club insolvencies, or a director disqualification. The policy states that \u201cdirect action\u201d can be taken more broadly, for: \u201cA very serious single act or persistent serious acts \u2026 where the individual\u2019s conduct is clearly damaging to the standing and reputation of the wider profession and the game of football.\u201d Vince told the Guardian he believes that is a \u201cfair description\u201d of Anderson\u2019s conduct, and the league should investigate. An EFL spokesman confirmed that the policy has been adopted, but it is understood not yet to be in force because the details of how it will work, and the necessary rules, are still being developed. Anderson declined to speak to the Guardian: he responded to Vince\u2019s criticism in two long statements on the club\u2019s website, saying in the first that he found it \u201cvery disrespectful and misleading to say the least\u201d \u2013 but he did not address the issue of Doidge\u2019s unpaid wages. \u201cI will not drop to the levels that [Vince] did in his various allegations to the press as I believe it will serve no practical purpose,\u201d Anderson said. The BWFC Supporters Trust wrote to the EFL on Tuesday expressing \u201cgrave concerns about the financial stability and sustainability of our club under the current ownership\u201d, and Anderson will face protests at the home match against West Bromwich Albion on 21 January, announced by six fans\u2019 blog sites. As yet, however, when the EFL\u2019s historic clubs are plunged into such turmoil, its powers to intervene remain limited.",

This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It\u2019s also what our professionals at the border want and need.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is just common sense. The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500bn a year, vastly more than the $5.7bn we have requested from Congress. The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.\u201d</p> \n<p>Factcheckers have poured scorn on Trump\u2019s assertion that the trade deal, a successor to Nafta, means that Mexico is paying for the wall. The Mexican government has always refused to do so. And following the address, critics were quick to point out that Democrats are against money for a border wall \u2013 whether steel or concrete.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a9e038b2-1fa9-43ea-97a8-bcfad61db4fd\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7ZikKcVQylU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Nearly three weeks in to the shutdown, Trump did not offer fresh ideas to break the current political impasse and did not declare a national emergency so that he could bypass Congress, as had been speculated. Instead he said: \u201cThe federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security.\u201d</p> \n<p>Calling on Democrats to pass a spending bill, he added: \u201cThis situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting. Hopefully we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.\u201d</p> \n<p>On an extraordinary night for US politics, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, delivered a live rebuttal from the House speaker\u2019s balcony hallway. Both adamantly oppose the construction of a wall and have urged Trump to reopen the government while talks continue.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"99ddd348-cba8-4c8f-93a0-310f154b7edc\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/86Vwzo9A6GU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cSadly, much of what we have heard from President Trump throughout this senseless shutdown has been full of misinformation and even malice,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cPresident Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis, and must reopen the government.\u201d</p> \n<p>Schumer added: \u201cWe don\u2019t govern by temper-tantrum. No president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down, hurting millions of Americans who are treated as leverage.</p> \n<p>\u201cTonight \u2013 and throughout this debate and his presidency \u2013 President Trump has appealed to fear, not facts. Division, not unity.\u201d</p> \n<p>The New York senator said: \u201cMost presidents have used Oval Office addresses for noble purposes. This president just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration.\u201d</p> \n<p>The White House countered those points on Wednesday by accusing Democrats of being in denial.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s fighting for the protection and the safety of every American citizen,\u201d the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said. \u201cIf this is the face and the future of the Democrat party I think things are looking really good for Republicans.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump has privately dismissed the address to the nation and his proposed visit to the border this week as pointless, according to the New York Times. In an off-the-record lunch with television anchors on Tuesday, he reportedly said he was talked into both steps by advisers.</p> \n<p>In the run-up to the address, the White House had been caught in a series of falsehoods. At the weekend, Sanders claimed 4,000 known or suspected terrorists had been apprehended at the southern border. On Monday, Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, admitted that this was \u201can unfortunate misstatement\u201d as most of the individuals had been stopped at airports.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Pence was questioned by NBC News on Monday about Trump\u2019s claim that some former presidents told him a wall should be built (all four living presidents have denied it). The vice-president replied: \u201cI know the president has said that that was his impression from previous administrations, previous presidents.\u201d</p> \n<p>The president, who has threatened to keep the government closed for months or even years, will attend a Senate <a href=\"https://link.axios.com/click/15645136.67061/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucG9saXRpY28uY29tL3N0b3J5LzIwMTkvMDEvMDgvc3VwcG9ydC1ncm93aW5nLXRydW1wLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1kZWNsYXJhdGlvbi0xMDg2MjI5P3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1uZXdzbGV0dGVyX2F4aW9zcG0mc3RyZWFtPXRvcA/58c6e533a79328702e8b4bbfB8504b36d\">Republican lunch meeting</a> on Wednesday, then visit the southern border on Thursday as he continues to wage a public relations offensive. The partial government shutdown is now the second-longest in history, affects more than 800,000 workers, and there is no end in sight.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday night, immigrants\u2019 right groups again condemned Trump\u2019s message. Lorella Praeli, the deputy political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said: \u201cWith tonight\u2019s speech, President Trump chose to compound the chaos because he can\u2019t convince the majority of Americans that their taxpayer dollars should fund his bogus campaign promise ... The president appears to be more focused on procuring his xenophobic symbol than running the government and upholding democratic norms.\u201d</p>",

In remarks lasting 10 minutes, Trump sought to make the case for a border wall \u2013 arguably the central promise of his short political career \u2013 and tried to imply the proposal had broad public support. \u201cLaw enforcement professionals have requested $5.7bn for a physical barrier,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It\u2019s also what our professionals at the border want and need. \u201cThis is just common sense. The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500bn a year, vastly more than the $5.7bn we have requested from Congress. The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.\u201d Factcheckers have poured scorn on Trump\u2019s assertion that the trade deal, a successor to Nafta, means that Mexico is paying for the wall. The Mexican government has always refused to do so. And following the address, critics were quick to point out that Democrats are against money for a border wall \u2013 whether steel or concrete. Nearly three weeks in to the shutdown, Trump did not offer fresh ideas to break the current political impasse and did not declare a national emergency so that he could bypass Congress, as had been speculated. Instead he said: \u201cThe federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security.\u201d Calling on Democrats to pass a spending bill, he added: \u201cThis situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting. Hopefully we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.\u201d On an extraordinary night for US politics, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, delivered a live rebuttal from the House speaker\u2019s balcony hallway. Both adamantly oppose the construction of a wall and have urged Trump to reopen the government while talks continue. \u201cSadly, much of what we have heard from President Trump throughout this senseless shutdown has been full of misinformation and even malice,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cPresident Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis, and must reopen the government.\u201d Schumer added: \u201cWe don\u2019t govern by temper-tantrum. No president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down, hurting millions of Americans who are treated as leverage. \u201cTonight \u2013 and throughout this debate and his presidency \u2013 President Trump has appealed to fear, not facts. Division, not unity.\u201d The New York senator said: \u201cMost presidents have used Oval Office addresses for noble purposes. This president just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration.\u201d The White House countered those points on Wednesday by accusing Democrats of being in denial. \u201cHe\u2019s fighting for the protection and the safety of every American citizen,\u201d the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said. \u201cIf this is the face and the future of the Democrat party I think things are looking really good for Republicans.\u201d Trump has privately dismissed the address to the nation and his proposed visit to the border this week as pointless, according to the New York Times. In an off-the-record lunch with television anchors on Tuesday, he reportedly said he was talked into both steps by advisers. In the run-up to the address, the White House had been caught in a series of falsehoods. At the weekend, Sanders claimed 4,000 known or suspected terrorists had been apprehended at the southern border. On Monday, Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, admitted that this was \u201can unfortunate misstatement\u201d as most of the individuals had been stopped at airports. Meanwhile, Pence was questioned by NBC News on Monday about Trump\u2019s claim that some former presidents told him a wall should be built (all four living presidents have denied it). The vice-president replied: \u201cI know the president has said that that was his impression from previous administrations, previous presidents.\u201d The president, who has threatened to keep the government closed for months or even years, will attend a Senate Republican lunch meeting on Wednesday, then visit the southern border on Thursday as he continues to wage a public relations offensive. The partial government shutdown is now the second-longest in history, affects more than 800,000 workers, and there is no end in sight. On Tuesday night, immigrants\u2019 right groups again condemned Trump\u2019s message. Lorella Praeli, the deputy political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said: \u201cWith tonight\u2019s speech, President Trump chose to compound the chaos because he can\u2019t convince the majority of Americans that their taxpayer dollars should fund his bogus campaign promise ... The president appears to be more focused on procuring his xenophobic symbol than running the government and upholding democratic norms.\u201d",

Another government study is examining whether calling male prisoners \u201cmen\u201d and cells \u201crooms\u201d, among other adjustments in terms, will help towards rehabilitation. I have my doubts, because we already know what truly works \u2013 fostering family ties. Which brings me back to in-cell phones. As well as being humane, they are safe. All calls are monitored and easily recorded, numbers are pre-approved \u2013 and paid for by the inmates, of course. But at the rate of progress of \u201cexploring the possibilities\u201d of their use in jails run by the prison service, it will be a long time before all prisoners and their families can access them. Or for that matter, years before they can simply pose for family snapshots in the institutions controlled by the very state that sends people into custody. \u2022 Eric Allison is the Guardian\u2019s prison correspondent",

      "bodyText": "German police and prosecutors have questioned some of the claims made by a rightwing populist politician who suffered an attack that left him with serious head injuries. Police say video footage casts doubt on assertions by Frank Magnitz that he was beaten with a wooden instrument by attackers who only stopped assaulting him when two passersby intervened. Magnitz, 66, the head of Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland in the city state of Bremen, was hospitalised on Monday evening after being attacked by strangers. The AfD claimed he had been knocked to the ground with a wooden instrument before being beaten around the head. J\u00f6rg Meuthen, the party\u2019s federal chairman, posted a photograph on Twitter on Tuesday, showing the MP, apparently unconscious, with a deep gash to his head and a bruised face, and calling the attack an \u201cassassination attempt\u201d. The party praised two plumbers who had helped Magnitz to his feet and called the police, saying they had saved his life by intervening and scaring off the attackers. But police, who have described the attack as \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d, said analysis of CCTV footage shows that while Magnitz was knocked to the ground, the person responsible had quickly fled accompanied by two others and there was no evidence that Magnitz had been kicked or beaten while he was lying on the ground. His head injuries, they said, were likely incurred after he hit his head having been knocked down. \u201cRecordings secured at the scene show two people who approached the 66-year-old from behind, while a third walked some distance behind,\u201d a spokeswoman for Bremen police said. \u201cOne of the unknown people hit the man causing him to topple over.\u201d The trio then fled the scene, she added. The MP suffered a heavy bleeding head wound, but \u201con the video material that has been watched so far, the use of an attack object cannot be detected\u201d. Prosecutors have opened an investigation into grievous bodily harm and have appealed for witnesses. Magnitz gave several interviews from his hospital bed on Tuesday. He told the Berliner Morgenpost that while he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to dramatise\u201d the attack, he believed it had been \u201ca politically motivated assassination attempt\u201d. In a subsequent interview with the tabloid Bild, he said while it was unlikely, he would not rule out that he might also have been the victim of a mugging.

He came round, he said, when someone shook his arm, and asked if he still had his mobile phone and his wallet. Magnitz said he suspected his attackers might have been participants at a nearby memorial demonstration for an asylum seeker who was killed in police custody in Bremen 14 years ago. He told the Morgenpost he assumed someone from the demonstration recognised him and decided to follow him. A spokeswoman for the event\u2019s organisers, the \u201cInitiative to remember Laye-Alama Cond\u00e9\u201d, accused Magnitz of speculation and of \u201cpurposefully wanting to discredit the subject matter of our event\u201d. The attack has been condemned across the political divide, with Steffen Seibert, the spokesman for Angela Merkel\u2019s government, tweeting that the \u201cbrutal attack\u201d should be strongly condemned. The AfD\u2019s leadership has called the assault a \u201cblack day for democracy\u201d, blaming it on constant AfD baiting by political parties and the media.

The book\u2019s hidden but difficult question concerns the surrogacy of the author\u2019s child, a subject that becomes increasingly relevant in Chidgey\u2019s relationship to the surrogate mother and to her own mother. So this is also a found novel in that it is vaguely plagiarised from reality.</p> <p>\u201cThe most common piece of graffiti is \u2018I was here\u2019, isn\u2019t it. And I think that is what creative writing is too \u2013 if we could stay off our phones in class please?\u201d, she writes, as a kind of metaphor for the whole book. It is also a replacement diary, in that each section is given over to one day of the year (with one exception: 7 March is a blank space, which might mean everything or nothing). There are some days, however, when it feels as though Chidgey couldn\u2019t be bothered with her own project.</p> <p>This kind of experimentation has precedents: the penultimate chapter of Joyce\u2019s <em>Ulysses</em>, with those interminable descriptions of Dublin waterworks; or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/feb/06/thesharpestshortstories\" title=\"\">F\u00e9lix F\u00e9n\u00e9on</a>\u2019s parody newspaper stories, <em>Novels </em><em>in Three Lines</em>. If Joyce represents the intrusion of the real and F\u00e9n\u00e9on how easily we can make \u201cfake news\u201d, then Chidgey occupies an uneasy ground in between. The stylistic problem is a sense of not knowing <em>why</em> one is being told all this. \u201cIt\u2019s cold in here. I might have to close the window. I just opened it a minute ago. Say hi Nana. Yes, I\u2019ve got my rings on. Yes. How are you all? Frazzled. You\u2019re not frazzling Mummy and Daddy are you? I\u2019ve got to do something with that top that Helen sent me.\u201d</p> <p>There is a good book in here, and I rather wish Chidgey had written it instead of publishing some kind of \u201cnotes towards a novel\u201d. There is a degree of bad faith in the extent to which she tries to ward off her critics by getting her rebuttal in first. At one point a voice says: \u201cI feel sick when I think about reviews, and I keep composing negative reviews in my head.\u201d At another, we find: \u201cIt\u2019s not really a story. Do you think you can get away with the lack of it?\u201d Or this indulgence: \u201cI gave a chunk of it to my publisher to read and he didn\u2019t say this is a big chaotic mess. He thinks it\u2019s cutting edge. I think if it\u2019s published it won\u2019t have terribly wide appeal \u2026 You want to be avant garde but not very.\u201d Nor did I care to read creative writing lectures or her memories of them: since the book shimmers between voices, you can\u2019t tell if she is teaching her own class or sitting in with a fellow lecturer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/30/nonfiction-and-fiction-to-look-out-for-in-2019-preview\">Fiction and nonfiction to look out for in 2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is an important ethical dimension that the book tries to address, and flinches from each time. We are told repeatedly when someone is being recorded; we are not told when someone is merely overheard. In one section the dignity of a square bracket is given when the conversation is remembered rather than recorded.</p> <p>The descriptions of her mother\u2019s illness are handled with both grace and a sense of pre-emptive commemoration. The relationship between grandmother and grandchild, one fogging in memory, one coming into memory, is done with admirable and touching truth \u2013 note: truth; not fiction.

And I think that is what creative writing is too \u2013 if we could stay off our phones in class please?\u201d, she writes, as a kind of metaphor for the whole book. It is also a replacement diary, in that each section is given over to one day of the year (with one exception: 7 March is a blank space, which might mean everything or nothing). There are some days, however, when it feels as though Chidgey couldn\u2019t be bothered with her own project. This kind of experimentation has precedents: the penultimate chapter of Joyce\u2019s Ulysses, with those interminable descriptions of Dublin waterworks; or F\u00e9lix F\u00e9n\u00e9on\u2019s parody newspaper stories, Novels in Three Lines. If Joyce represents the intrusion of the real and F\u00e9n\u00e9on how easily we can make \u201cfake news\u201d, then Chidgey occupies an uneasy ground in between. The stylistic problem is a sense of not knowing why one is being told all this. \u201cIt\u2019s cold in here. I might have to close the window. I just opened it a minute ago. Say hi Nana. Yes, I\u2019ve got my rings on. Yes. How are you all? Frazzled. You\u2019re not frazzling Mummy and Daddy are you? I\u2019ve got to do something with that top that Helen sent me.\u201d There is a good book in here, and I rather wish Chidgey had written it instead of publishing some kind of \u201cnotes towards a novel\u201d. There is a degree of bad faith in the extent to which she tries to ward off her critics by getting her rebuttal in first. At one point a voice says: \u201cI feel sick when I think about reviews, and I keep composing negative reviews in my head.\u201d At another, we find: \u201cIt\u2019s not really a story. Do you think you can get away with the lack of it?\u201d Or this indulgence: \u201cI gave a chunk of it to my publisher to read and he didn\u2019t say this is a big chaotic mess. He thinks it\u2019s cutting edge. I think if it\u2019s published it won\u2019t have terribly wide appeal \u2026 You want to be avant garde but not very.\u201d Nor did I care to read creative writing lectures or her memories of them: since the book shimmers between voices, you can\u2019t tell if she is teaching her own class or sitting in with a fellow lecturer. There is an important ethical dimension that the book tries to address, and flinches from each time. We are told repeatedly when someone is being recorded; we are not told when someone is merely overheard. In one section the dignity of a square bracket is given when the conversation is remembered rather than recorded. The descriptions of her mother\u2019s illness are handled with both grace and a sense of pre-emptive commemoration. The relationship between grandmother and grandchild, one fogging in memory, one coming into memory, is done with admirable and touching truth \u2013 note: truth; not fiction. As for the rest, it\u2019s been said that other people\u2019s dreams are boring. So, it would seem, are their days. \u2022 Stuart Kelly\u2019s The Minister and the Murderer is published by Granta.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May will be obliged to present MPs with a new Brexit plan within three days if her current proposal is voted down next week, after a procedural amendment to the plan\u2019s progress through the Commons was passed amid chaotic scenes. The amendment to the business motion for the plan, drawn up by the Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve, gives May the deadline to put forward new plans if she loses the vote, as many expect, next Tuesday. The amendment was passed by 308 votes to 297 following stormy scenes in which a series of Conservative MPs castigated the Speaker, John Bercow, for allowing the amendment. Amid a series of furious points of order lasting more than an hour, a series of Conservatives argued that Commons precedent dictated that business motions could only be changed by ministers. But Bercow, who won equally noisy support from Labour MPs and some remain-minded Conservatives, insisted he could make the decision, and would side with the interests of parliament over the executive. A previous amendment by Grieve, voted through by the Commons before Christmas, means any statement that follows a defeat is in itself amendable \u2013 allowing MPs to put forward their own alternatives for the future of the Brexit process. So if May came back with an alternative plan, that could be amended by MPs, giving parliament far more scope in setting the direction. Downing Street had made clear that if next week\u2019s vote were lost, the prime minister would, whether or not the amendment were passed, come back to the House of Commons and set out her plans well before the 21-day time limit set out in the Withdrawal Act. \u201cWe would seek to provide certainty, quickly,\u201d a government spokesman said, speaking to journalists after prime minister\u2019s questions. Bercow provoked fury from the Tory benches for selecting the amendment, which government sources alleged went against the advice of the House of Commons. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, said Bercow should publish the advice he received from the Commons clerks. A No 10 spokesman insisted the government had received clear advice that suggested the motion was not amendable. \u201cWe are surprised the government amendment was selected; the advice we received was that it would not be in order,\u201d he said. Before the vote, MPs made heated points of order for more than an hour, many criticising the Speaker.

I cannot allow debate but I have selected the amendment.\u201d Bercow said that he did not think it was unreasonable to amend the motion and hinted he might routinely allow business motions to be amended by backbenchers. \u201cI understand the importance of precedence but it does not completely bind,\u201d he said, as Leadsom shook her head. \u201cIf we were guided only by precedence nothing in our procedures would ever change.\u201d Earlier in the discussions on the floor of the house, the pro-leave Tory MP Peter Bone said he had been informed by officials that the motion was unamendable when he had inquired about his own amendment on Tuesday night. The Conservative MP Mark Francois, a vice-chair of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, said: \u201cI have never known any occasion where the Speaker has overruled a motion of the House of Commons \u2026 why are you overriding a motion of the house?\u201d Tory MP Ken Clarke, who backed the amendment, said those who did not like the amendment should \u201cdon a yellow jacket and go outside\u201d to join some of the hard-right protesters who had harassed MPs outside parliament. The amendment says that if the deal is defeated \u201ca minister of the crown shall table within three sitting days a motion \u2026 considering the process of exiting the European Union under article 50\u201d. Earlier Grieve said the change was sensible given the time pressures. \u201cI realise there are a few of my colleagues who believe that if the government\u2019s deal is rejected we should simply do nothing and leave the EU on March 29 with no deal at all and with all, to my mind, the calamitous consequences that would follow on from it,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cI disagree with that, and so I think do the vast majority of members of parliament. The only way we can move forward if the government\u2019s deal is not acceptable to parliament is for parliament to engage with government and find a solution, which is what I am trying to do.\u201d Other MPs who signed the amendment include the former Tory ministers Sir Oliver Letwin, Jo Johnson, Guto Bebb and Sam Gyimah. It has also been backed by Labour MPs including Stephen Doughty and Chris Leslie. The latest blow for May comes a day after the government suffered a significant defeat on the finance bill, in which a powerful cross-party group of MPs led by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper passed an amendment limiting the government\u2019s tax administration powers in the event of the UK leaving the EU with no deal. Its purpose was to prove there was a parliamentary majority to oppose no deal, and the cross-party group of rebels who organised Tuesday\u2019s defeat and said they could seek to amend any and every piece of legislation the government brings to parliament between now and March.",

Our humanity is not seen as valuable.</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen myself and my feelings reflected in so many people\u2019s responses to the series. From folks so triggered by the stories that they couldn\u2019t watch it because it reminded them of their assaults, to the advocates and celebrities praising the series and the courageous women who have spoken out, and to those who simply can\u2019t understand how and why this happens, especially to our children.</p> <p>I\u2019m a black woman, someone who has experienced sexual and emotional violence, someone who works directly with movements such as <a href=\"https://metoomvmt.org/\" title=\"\">#MeToo</a> supporting the work of ending sexual violence and the criminalisation of marginalised people.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This series is about survivors.

I was privileged to see a small snippet before it aired. (At the New York screening that was evacuated after a anonymous bomb threat was made on the building.) I thought I was prepared to hold the weight of the series. But I was wrong. I still found myself weeping on my couch each night, feeling both hopeless and empowered at the same time. I believe many women of colour and survivors across communities know that feeling all too well.</p> <p>But I knew that if I responded in that way, knowing what I know and doing what I do, then this series was going to change things for the better. And that\u2019s happening already.</p> <p>All the young women who shared their stories with the world last week spoke of some of the most unimaginable harms a person could endure. Yet they still participated. They \u2013 along with the producers, movement leaders, advocates, experts, industry folk, family members and others who featured in the series \u2013 knew that seeing all of them together and hearing their stories, both individually and as part of a collective story, would reach people in ways that haven\u2019t happened before, because their humanity and the attempts to destroy it would touch people, including some who didn\u2019t even think they cared about what was happening to black and brown girls in Chicago and Atlanta. And that made it a risk worth taking. But they shouldn\u2019t be the only ones taking risks to stop all this.</p> <p>The responses from women of colour range from being happy that people are finally seeing the severity of Kelly\u2019s alleged crimes (he has denied all allegations levelled against him), to feeling that the series failed by not focusing on the survivors\u2019 healing or movement forward. But what we must not ignore is that the door has been kicked open for us to continue having this and the broader conversations about protecting women and girls of colour, and ending violence against women.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/04/lady-gaga-jay-z-surviving-r-kelly-docu-series\">Lady Gaga, Jay-Z allegedly declined to appear in Surviving R Kelly docu-series</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All creative projects are imperfect and could be picked apart based on any viewer\u2019s likes, expectations, past opinions or allegiances. However, we can\u2019t let the drive for perfection get in the way of what is good. This series is about survivors. It\u2019s about using storytelling and truth as tools for furthering the fight. It\u2019s about showing those who suffer in silence that it\u2019s not just them, and that it\u2019s not their fault no matter what they\u2019re being told by society, family or their abuser.</p> <p>If Surviving R Kelly has accomplished nothing else it dragged an alleged predator, who is accused of attempting to ruin the lives of black and brown girls and women for decades, out of the darkness and into the light. We need to use this moment to continue telling stories, building movements and spaces that are for and led by survivors, and we need to trust women and girls when they say they\u2019re being harmed. If we can do that, we can take down men who perpetrate such violence, and the systems that have allowed them to exist for so long.</p> <p>\u2022 Chelsea Fuller is a writer and communications strategist</p>",

Our humanity is not seen as valuable. I\u2019ve seen myself and my feelings reflected in so many people\u2019s responses to the series. From folks so triggered by the stories that they couldn\u2019t watch it because it reminded them of their assaults, to the advocates and celebrities praising the series and the courageous women who have spoken out, and to those who simply can\u2019t understand how and why this happens, especially to our children. I\u2019m a black woman, someone who has experienced sexual and emotional violence, someone who works directly with movements such as #MeToo supporting the work of ending sexual violence and the criminalisation of marginalised people. I know the producer of the series and people in it. I was privileged to see a small snippet before it aired. (At the New York screening that was evacuated after a anonymous bomb threat was made on the building.) I thought I was prepared to hold the weight of the series. But I was wrong. I still found myself weeping on my couch each night, feeling both hopeless and empowered at the same time. I believe many women of colour and survivors across communities know that feeling all too well. But I knew that if I responded in that way, knowing what I know and doing what I do, then this series was going to change things for the better. And that\u2019s happening already. All the young women who shared their stories with the world last week spoke of some of the most unimaginable harms a person could endure. Yet they still participated. They \u2013 along with the producers, movement leaders, advocates, experts, industry folk, family members and others who featured in the series \u2013 knew that seeing all of them together and hearing their stories, both individually and as part of a collective story, would reach people in ways that haven\u2019t happened before, because their humanity and the attempts to destroy it would touch people, including some who didn\u2019t even think they cared about what was happening to black and brown girls in Chicago and Atlanta. And that made it a risk worth taking. But they shouldn\u2019t be the only ones taking risks to stop all this. The responses from women of colour range from being happy that people are finally seeing the severity of Kelly\u2019s alleged crimes (he has denied all allegations levelled against him), to feeling that the series failed by not focusing on the survivors\u2019 healing or movement forward. But what we must not ignore is that the door has been kicked open for us to continue having this and the broader conversations about protecting women and girls of colour, and ending violence against women. All creative projects are imperfect and could be picked apart based on any viewer\u2019s likes, expectations, past opinions or allegiances. However, we can\u2019t let the drive for perfection get in the way of what is good. This series is about survivors. It\u2019s about using storytelling and truth as tools for furthering the fight. It\u2019s about showing those who suffer in silence that it\u2019s not just them, and that it\u2019s not their fault no matter what they\u2019re being told by society, family or their abuser. If Surviving R Kelly has accomplished nothing else it dragged an alleged predator, who is accused of attempting to ruin the lives of black and brown girls and women for decades, out of the darkness and into the light. We need to use this moment to continue telling stories, building movements and spaces that are for and led by survivors, and we need to trust women and girls when they say they\u2019re being harmed. If we can do that, we can take down men who perpetrate such violence, and the systems that have allowed them to exist for so long. \u2022 Chelsea Fuller is a writer and communications strategist",

It busies itself with sex and fame \u2013 and also something rarely acknowledged in detail in costume dramas about writers: money. This is the story of how talented young author and country mouse Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette (played with wand-like grace by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/keiraknightley\" title=\"\">Keira Knightley</a>) submits in 1893 to marriage and commercial exploitation by an older man from the big city, the mediocre and flatulent critic-slash-publisher Henri Gauthier-Villars, pen-named \u201cWilly\u201d.</p> <p>He brings out her wildly popular Claudine novels (racy autobiographical adventures of girlish yearning) under his own name, without giving his wife a smidgen of the acclaim rightly owing to her, still less any loot. Willy is played with a smirk and a goatee by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/dominic-west\" title=\"\">Dominic West</a>, who also, importantly, endows him with bullish charm. Yet West makes him a grisly and decreasingly engaging figure, especially when the philandering Willy becomes someone who needs his mistresses to dress as schoolgirls (in the modish \u201cClaudine\u201d garb) before he can get an erection.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZdh6Aax7KE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BZdh6Aax7KE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>#CacheTonPorc? Colette (as she is to style herself) gets a sweeter revenge. She comes to reject her husband\u2019s dishonesty, embrace her own writerly identity and leave \u201cWilly\u201d in the dustbin of history. But this happens after she has learned something from him about the ways of the world and the peculiarities of the literary and sexual marketplace. It is Willy who has punched up her original prim manuscripts with his own narrative gusto and swarthy romance. He encouraged her, from pervily obsessive fascination and entrepreneurial zeal, to have gay affairs that she could then write about with the names changed. She is no Proustian prisoner, but the film suggests that he has in some sense authored her. Or perhaps it is that Colette allowed herself to be authored as a temporary career move: a necessary apprenticeship and virginity loss.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/28/keira-knightley-i-cant-act-flirt-or-mother-to-get-voice-heard\">Keira Knightley: 'I can\u2019t act the flirt or mother to get my voice heard. It makes me feel sick'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Knightley brings something brittle and skittish to the part of the young Colette, qualities that soften into sexiness; she is a <em>na\u00eff </em>who is ordered by her mama (the dependably intelligent and complex <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/fiona-shaw\" title=\"\">Fiona Shaw</a>) to take a basket on a country walk so she can collect blackberries for the family\u2019s tea. In fact, she is sneaking into a barn to have sex with her ageing fiance. Once they are married, Colette finds herself in Paris\u2019s exciting world of modernity: new-fangled bicycles and electric light. More importantly, she is to discover a prototypical world of corporate branding in which individual writers can be messed with.</p> <p>Preposterous Willy fancies himself the head of something like a Hollywood studio churning out hot properties: pulp bestsellers. He is fascinated by the new \u201ctalking pictures\u201d and wonders if a \u201ccine-play\u201d could be made of Claudine\u2019s adventures. But the awful truth is that he and all the other hopeless males he employs have no talent. Colette is the only one who has. She has a gift which, in a reversal of gold-mining, needs to de-refined, good writing that must be smudged and smeared with commercial prurience before it will sell.

      "bodyText": "Wash Westmoreland\u2019s Colette is A Star Is Born for the belle \u00e9poque: an early-years biopic of French literary phenomenon Colette that is invigorating, mercenary and sexy. It busies itself with sex and fame \u2013 and also something rarely acknowledged in detail in costume dramas about writers: money. This is the story of how talented young author and country mouse Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette (played with wand-like grace by Keira Knightley) submits in 1893 to marriage and commercial exploitation by an older man from the big city, the mediocre and flatulent critic-slash-publisher Henri Gauthier-Villars, pen-named \u201cWilly\u201d. He brings out her wildly popular Claudine novels (racy autobiographical adventures of girlish yearning) under his own name, without giving his wife a smidgen of the acclaim rightly owing to her, still less any loot. Willy is played with a smirk and a goatee by Dominic West, who also, importantly, endows him with bullish charm. Yet West makes him a grisly and decreasingly engaging figure, especially when the philandering Willy becomes someone who needs his mistresses to dress as schoolgirls (in the modish \u201cClaudine\u201d garb) before he can get an erection. #CacheTonPorc? Colette (as she is to style herself) gets a sweeter revenge. She comes to reject her husband\u2019s dishonesty, embrace her own writerly identity and leave \u201cWilly\u201d in the dustbin of history. But this happens after she has learned something from him about the ways of the world and the peculiarities of the literary and sexual marketplace. It is Willy who has punched up her original prim manuscripts with his own narrative gusto and swarthy romance. He encouraged her, from pervily obsessive fascination and entrepreneurial zeal, to have gay affairs that she could then write about with the names changed. She is no Proustian prisoner, but the film suggests that he has in some sense authored her. Or perhaps it is that Colette allowed herself to be authored as a temporary career move: a necessary apprenticeship and virginity loss. Knightley brings something brittle and skittish to the part of the young Colette, qualities that soften into sexiness; she is a na\u00eff who is ordered by her mama (the dependably intelligent and complex Fiona Shaw) to take a basket on a country walk so she can collect blackberries for the family\u2019s tea. In fact, she is sneaking into a barn to have sex with her ageing fiance. Once they are married, Colette finds herself in Paris\u2019s exciting world of modernity: new-fangled bicycles and electric light. More importantly, she is to discover a prototypical world of corporate branding in which individual writers can be messed with. Preposterous Willy fancies himself the head of something like a Hollywood studio churning out hot properties: pulp bestsellers. He is fascinated by the new \u201ctalking pictures\u201d and wonders if a \u201ccine-play\u201d could be made of Claudine\u2019s adventures. But the awful truth is that he and all the other hopeless males he employs have no talent. Colette is the only one who has. She has a gift which, in a reversal of gold-mining, needs to de-refined, good writing that must be smudged and smeared with commercial prurience before it will sell. Willy sees this; Colette doesn\u2019t. Finally, Colette is to fall for the beautiful and androgynous Mathilde De Morny (Denise Gough) with whom she stages a studiedly outrageous theatre event, greeted by the stuffed shirts of Parisian society like the Marquess of Queensberry witnessing the \u201csomdomite\u201d behaviour of Oscar Wilde. Knightley and West have a tremendous chemistry: two very smart and worldly performances that suggest Colette and Willy did enjoy something like a real love affair, and that Colette was never simply a victim, nor Willy simply an exploiter. Perhaps, to extend the Hollywood analogy, he saw himself an old-style mogul running an industry in its pre-auteur state, when the assignment of authorship was not a priority. But keeping his wife\u2019s earnings certainly was. This is a highly enjoyable and bracing piece of work from Wash Westmoreland, who with his late partner, Richard Glatzer, made the excellent Still Alice, with Julianne Moore. He co-scripted this movie with Glatzer, who died of ALS or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 2015: the film is dedicated to him. There is a cheeky flourish in their script here, when Willy declares that Claudine \u201castounds us with her moxie\u201d. This film does much the same.",

Black Sheep shortlisted for an Oscar Congratulations to the team behind the Guardian documentary Black Sheep, which has been shortlisted in the documentary short subject category at the Oscars. The final five nominations will be announced on 22 January. Coming up: Fighting Shame A group of women from Leeds with experience of poverty come together to make a film about their experiences. Collectively researching and producing the film, they illustrate the shame felt by people through eight individual household objects: a cooker, a kettle, a bed, a school uniform, a present, a bus ticket, a coffin and a tampon. In this quiet and beautiful film, the women tell their own stories of poverty and shame and say they want their voices to be heard, and for people in power to listen.

At the same time Ireland\u2019s prime minister Leo Varadkar, reflecting the principles of the withdrawal agreement, said Stormont could not have the power of veto over the backstop. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can have a situation whereby the Northern Ireland executive or assembly has a veto power [over the backstop] because that would essentially give one of the two communities veto power over the other,\u201d he told Reuters in Ethiopia. With less than a week to go to the critical parliamentary vote on the Brexit withdrawal agreement, the government appears no closer to securing the 10 votes of the DUP MPs needed to get the deal over the line. In a 13-page document published on Wednesday, the government promised a \u201cstrong role\u201d for the currently defunct Stormont assembly if the Brexit backstop was triggered. It promised that if the trade talks with the EU failed to result in a deal by the end of the transition period in December 2020, Stormont would be consulted before the government decided its next move. Under the current deal the UK can ask for an extension in the transition period or enter the backstop arrangements. Under the plan, the view of the assembly, which has not been sitting for two years, would then be presented to parliament before MPs took a final decision. The paper promised that this \u201cStormont lock\u201d on the backstop would be a legally binding commitment. \u201cWhere appropriate we will legislate to ensure that these commitments have legal force,\u201d the government said in its paper, the UK Government Commitments to Northern Ireland and its Integral Place in the United Kingdom. However, the DUP immediately rejected the paper, dashing hopes that the party would get behind May for the vote on her Brexit deal next Tuesday. Tory sources who were ambivalent about the vote had said that the support of the DUP could \u201cunlock\u201d 20 to 30 more hard Brexiter votes for May, something now unlikely. Nigel Dodds, the leader of the DUP in the House of Commons, said the proposal to ensure \u201ca strong role for the Northern Ireland assembly before Northern Ireland-specific backstop provisions are given effect is cosmetic and meaningless\u201d. He said the paper itself indicated that the proposals made it plain the Stormont assembly would never be able to \u201coverride\u201d the backstop as it would be part of an internationally binding treaty. Any objections that were raised in Stormont could be rejected by London, said Dodds, MP for Belfast North. The DUP\u2019s Sammy Wilson told Sky News there was \u201cnothing at all\u201d to fear from a no-deal Brexit. \u201cWe would prefer to have the relationship sorted out but it can\u2019t be sorted out on the basis of breaking up the UK,\u201d said the East Antrim MP. \u201cThis issue is far too important,\u201d he added, \u201cThis is an issue about if Northern Ireland stays in the UK, whether Northern Ireland keeps linked to its main market in GB. Constitutionally and economically if this deal went through it would ruin us. \u201cWe would do what the IRA failed to do over 40 years of a terrorist campaign,\u201d he said in reference to their desire for a united Ireland.

It might just make it <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/05/opinion/sunday/mexican-drug-smugglers-to-trump-thanks.html?_r=0\">more expensive for drug dealers</a> to get drugs to customers in the US.</p> \n<h2>2. Illegal immigration to the US has plummeted</h2> \n<p>In 2000, the government apprehended 1.6 million people crossing the border illegally. Last year, it apprehended 310,531, the lowest figure since 1971. This number reflects a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/25/us-illegal-border-crossings-analysis-trump-migrants\">drop in illegal immigration</a> that has held steady since the economic recession in 2008.</p> \n<h2>3. People in the US illegally often enter legally</h2> \n<p>While 310,531 people were apprehended trying to cross the southern border illegally in 2017, in the same year more than 600,000 people who entered the US legally by air or sea overstayed their visas and remained in the country at the end of the year, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</p> \n<p>This is a tiny fraction of the 52 million people who entered the US legally in 2017. It is estimated that the number of visa overstays are actually higher, because the DHS report does not include land crossings.</p> \n<h2>4. Unaccompanied children and families seeking asylum are approaching the border at overwhelming rates</h2> \n<p>In November, more than 25,000 families crossed the border, the highest monthly total on record.

But on Sunday, in talks with Democrats aimed at ending the government shutdown, the White House added to its border wall funding proposal an offer of $800m to help fund care for families seeking asylum.</p> \n<h2><strong>5. Terrorists rarely enter the US through Mexico</strong></h2> \n<p>While Trump frequently mentions terrorism when discussing immigration, it is notable that he did not discuss it in his address.</p> \n<p>At the weekend, Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, claimed that 4,000 known or suspected terrorists had been apprehended at the southern border, something her colleague Kellyanne Conway admitted was \u201can unfortunate misstatement\u201d.</p> \n<p>In September, a state department report concerning 2017 <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/283100.pdf\">found</a> \u201cno credible evidence indicating that international terrorist groups have established bases in Mexico, worked with Mexican drug cartels, or sent operatives via Mexico into the United States. The US southern border remains vulnerable to potential terrorist transit, although terrorist groups likely seek other means of trying to enter the United States.\u201d</p> \n<p>A report released by the justice department in January 2018 linked immigrants to terrorism.

The US president blamed criminal gangs and \u201cvast quantities of illegal drugs\u201d for \u201cthousands of deaths\u201d, described the situation at the border with Mexico as a humanitarian crisis and argued that the current immigration system allows \u201cvicious coyotes and ruthless gangs\u201d to prey on immigrants, especially women and children. Trump\u2019s arguments often rely on inaccurate or dated statistics and lack important context about the situation at the border, which, as always, is complicated. Here are six things you should know about the president\u2019s address. 1. A wall won\u2019t stop drug traffickers In his address, Trump cited accurate numbers about drug overdoses in the US, but omitted important context when making the argument that building a wall would remedy these issues. \u201cOur southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl,\u201d Trump said. \u201cEvery week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90% of which floods across from our southern border.\u201d The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has said the most common way for traffickers to smuggle drugs across the border is actually by hiding them in cars that drive through official border checkpoints. And a wall would not resolve the demand for drugs. It might just make it more expensive for drug dealers to get drugs to customers in the US. 2. Illegal immigration to the US has plummeted In 2000, the government apprehended 1.6 million people crossing the border illegally. Last year, it apprehended 310,531, the lowest figure since 1971. This number reflects a drop in illegal immigration that has held steady since the economic recession in 2008. 3. People in the US illegally often enter legally While 310,531 people were apprehended trying to cross the southern border illegally in 2017, in the same year more than 600,000 people who entered the US legally by air or sea overstayed their visas and remained in the country at the end of the year, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This is a tiny fraction of the 52 million people who entered the US legally in 2017. It is estimated that the number of visa overstays are actually higher, because the DHS report does not include land crossings. 4. Unaccompanied children and families seeking asylum are approaching the border at overwhelming rates In November, more than 25,000 families crossed the border, the highest monthly total on record. They are mostly from Central America and are fleeing violence and poverty. Trump incorrectly explained this surge on Tuesday night. \u201cLast month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase,\u201d he said. \u201cThese children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.\u201d There is no way to track how many children are smuggled in maliciously and the numbers he cited to support this claim were actually about family apprehensions at the border, which means he is implying parents were smugglers or gang members. The Trump administration shut down Obama-era programs that tried to address this problem and has implemented a metering policy at major ports of entry that limits how many people can seek asylum each day. Shelters on both sides of the border are overwhelmed by asylum seekers and US Customs and Border Protection officers have been asking for more resources to house and process people. People have a legal right to seek asylum but processing their claims is tough: the immigration court backlog has hit more than a million cases, according to Syracuse University\u2019s transactional records access clearinghouse. Trump consistently depicts the border crisis as an issue of national security, not a humanitarian matter. But on Sunday, in talks with Democrats aimed at ending the government shutdown, the White House added to its border wall funding proposal an offer of $800m to help fund care for families seeking asylum. 5. Terrorists rarely enter the US through Mexico While Trump frequently mentions terrorism when discussing immigration, it is notable that he did not discuss it in his address. At the weekend, Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, claimed that 4,000 known or suspected terrorists had been apprehended at the southern border, something her colleague Kellyanne Conway admitted was \u201can unfortunate misstatement\u201d. In September, a state department report concerning 2017 found \u201cno credible evidence indicating that international terrorist groups have established bases in Mexico, worked with Mexican drug cartels, or sent operatives via Mexico into the United States. The US southern border remains vulnerable to potential terrorist transit, although terrorist groups likely seek other means of trying to enter the United States.\u201d A report released by the justice department in January 2018 linked immigrants to terrorism.

Among that group, 47% were convicted for illegally entering or re-entering the US and 13% had records or convictions for sexual, violent or firearms offenses. As PRI\u2019s The World points out, a total of 362,000 people were apprehended by border patrol in the same period, which means one in 450 of them had such convictions.

Although I think there are a bunch of men's roles that I wish I could do. As far as alternative career directions, as I mentioned before, I'm deeply interested in pursuing tracking as a discipline not necessarily a career. In a funny way it lends itself to what I do as an actor. When you're tracking an animal (not for the purposes of hunting, which I am profoundly opposed to as a sport) you have to put yourself in its paws, so to speak. It requires empathy, listening, an ability to focus on the micro as well as the macro, to zoom in on detail while also taking in the bigger picture. And even if you don't locate the animal or if you can't ultimately find it, it's as though you're in conversation with that animal, which I find profoundly magical, for lack of a better word. Pursuing tracking has actually, I think, made me a better actor. It's certainly reinvigorated my interest in my job. I could say it's reawakened something in me that I think I had perhaps lost touch with, having been doing this for so many years. So I hope to continue doing it as a way of maintaining contact with a part of myself that I need access to in order to be good at my job.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c35f768e4b0cebe76182d98\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-09T13:30:50.937Z\">1.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13269962\">ValuedCustomer</a> asks:</p> <p><em>How did you break into film acting?

If you're preaching to the converted, it doesn't matter. Because it's not about preaching. It's not as grand as that. A person's experience while watching a play is completely private and personal - you have no idea what's going on in their head.

If you're under 25 there's also 'young + free' tickets which are donated by members of the theatre and others. And there's always cancellations. So come to the theatre and hang out up until curtain time and you may get a seat. It's also worth noting that if you are a member already or have already bought your tickets, the Donmar can't legally put anyone in your seat if you don't show up so please call and cancel your seats and get a refund if you can't go, so someone else can go in your stead. It's no fun seeing empty seats in the theatre!

They are two different skillsets even though I think having a solid sense of stagecraft is helpful when you're in front of a camera. I work mostly on television now when I'm on camera. I've only made a couple of indie films in the last few years. I like TV work because it's fast. You're free to be somewhat more expressive. But that could be just a matter of the roles I play.

      "bodyText": "Tangletwigs asks: Raising Hope, cancelled. Please discuss \u2013 it\u2019s not fair. Plus, Goonies: thank you. pumpkindoge asks: I read an interview many years ago in which you said you weren\u2019t into partying hard \u2013 you preferred staying in and reading with friends. Much as I\u2019d hate to be disillusioned after all this time, was that really how you spent your teenage years? Grahamsterdam asks: One of my favourite lines of dialogue in the film Pecker is your character\u2019s, \u201cNo teabagging!\u201d When you read the script was there an explanation of what that meant? Were you baffled? I had never heard the expression until then. Robert Richard Twyford asks: Are there any particular roles or alternative career directions you would like to take in the future? ValuedCustomer asks: How did you break into film acting? One understands it\u2019s a rather tricky business to get into. Liz1976 asks: Just this morning you have deleted your Twitter account! Can I politely ask you why? I know it\u2019s awful. We all know it\u2019s awful. We can take breaks from the dreadful humans on it, but deletion seems extreme. You are one of the finest voices on there. You make me smile and you shut down the rightwing loons with grace and aplomb. Please reconsider. Also, what\u2019s your favourite David Bowie album? floatinginyarn asks: Having been an environmental activist, do you think there is much hope for us all looking at the current situation? I mean, how do you accept what is going on in the US? Do you believe that theatre still has a place in raising awareness or are you just preaching to the converted? Is it even important anymore? PS, I loved Running on Empty. Scott McLennan asks: Your introductory scene in The Goonies features you standing on a jetty, dunking your head in a barrel of water and pulling out a giant crab, yet it\u2019s never explained why. Was something important edited out of this scene, along with the similarly ditched giant octopus and escaped gorilla subplots? outofit asks: Why did you take your mother\u2019s surname and not your father\u2019s? leavesontheline asks: Loved your scenes with Dianne Wiest in Parenthood, and have found you always bring a particular quality to your roles. Given the essential silliness of acting, do you find it hard to maintain the interest and energy in new projects? And does it become a job like any other, or do you still find it exciting? Contentment asks: I\u2019ve admired much of your work on screen \u2026 My question is of a somewhat sensitive nature. Your advocacy for abortion/abortion rights is well known. In the span of your career, has being vocal about your abortion advocacy helped with or hindered any job opportunities? Thank you kindly. (I myself am 100% anti-abortion.) Andyb1967 asks: Good or bad memories of Shy People? I am a big fan of this overlooked classic. Adam Best asks: I bought you a glass of wine at a gig in Dalston about a month ago. My question is: did you enjoy the glass of wine? My other question is: do you mind people buying you a glass of wine because they go mad that you were in the Goonies? All the best. haemodroid asks: Do you like marmalade? Manolette asks: Any chance of Sweat transferring to the West End? I failed to get tickets and would love to see you in the play. Also I loved The Real O\u2019Neals. Looked like a lot of fun to make. Was it as much fun on set as it appeared to be on screen? ID6096389 asks: I saw you from the first row on stage in Sweat, and I was stricken by how precise your acting is, even in ways that would be imperceptible to the largest part of a theatre audience. That made me wonder: how does acting on screen compare to acting on stage? Do you inhabit your character in the same ways, or do you emphasise different things, a different physicality? Lilaitomniweotawicha asks: What/who is your spirit animal?

He said the popularity of the new vegan roll had not dented sales of Greggs\u2019 traditional sausage rolls, which also increased last week. Greggs sells about 1.5m of the meat version every week.</p> <p>Whiteside made the comments alongside a trading update for the final three months of the year. The company said it had enjoyed a strong finish to 2018, prompting it to raise its profit guidance for the second time in two months, bucking the trend among high street retailers.</p> <p>Shares jumped nearly 7% to a record high of \u00a314.61 after Greggs said December had beaten expectations, thanks to bumper sales of its festive bake and mince pies as well as its hot drinks and breakfast range.</p> <p>The company is expecting pre-tax profits of at least \u00a388m for 2018, having already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/27/greggs-profits-high-street-bakery-menu\">upgraded its guidance in November</a>, when it said profits would be at least \u00a386m. Greggs made a pre-tax profit of \u00a381.8m in 2017.</p> <p>Greggs has increased sales and profits despite a tough backdrop for high-street retailers struggling with rising business costs, a switch to online spending and faltering consumer confidence as Brexit looms.</p> <p>Whiteside said that sales at its high-street shops were still growing \u2013 albeit at a slower rate than its stores at other locations such as railway stations, retail parks and service stations \u2013 helped by strong demand for its breakfast ranges as well as its traditional steak bakes and sausage rolls.</p> <p>\u201cI think it demonstrates how our business has changed,\u201d he said. \u201cOur high-street shops are less reliant on shopping missions and that\u2019s making us more resilient. People working on the high street are coming in for breakfast before the shops are open.\u201d</p> <p>Total sales rose 7.2% in the year to 29 December, while like-for-like sales \u2013 stripping out the impact of sales in shops open for less than a year \u2013 increased by 2.9%.

      "bodyText": "The new vegan sausage roll launched by Greggs is \u201cflying off the shelves\u201d, leaving Britain\u2019s biggest bakery chain unable to keep up with demand after selling hundreds of thousands in the first week. The \u00a31 rolls have been selling out rapidly, depleting the stocks held at Greggs\u2019 factory in Newcastle, where they are made and frozen before being sent out to shops to bake. Roger Whiteside, the chief executive, said the firm had been taken by surprise over their popularity and the level of publicity surrounding the launch, and was ramping up production in response. \u201cNow that we know it is selling, we want to get it out there as quickly as possible. The shops that do have it are selling out instantly and the shops that didn\u2019t get it are screaming for it.\u201d The Quorn-filled vegan alternative to the traditional meat version was launched in 950 of Greggs\u2019 1,950 shops on 3 January, coinciding with the beginning of Veganuary, a growing movement that encourages people to embrace plant-based diets during January. \u201cIt\u2019s literally flying off the shelves,\u201d said Whiteside, who added it was the fastest-selling new line in the six years he had been with the company. He said the popularity of the new vegan roll had not dented sales of Greggs\u2019 traditional sausage rolls, which also increased last week. Greggs sells about 1.5m of the meat version every week. Whiteside made the comments alongside a trading update for the final three months of the year. The company said it had enjoyed a strong finish to 2018, prompting it to raise its profit guidance for the second time in two months, bucking the trend among high street retailers. Shares jumped nearly 7% to a record high of \u00a314.61 after Greggs said December had beaten expectations, thanks to bumper sales of its festive bake and mince pies as well as its hot drinks and breakfast range. The company is expecting pre-tax profits of at least \u00a388m for 2018, having already upgraded its guidance in November, when it said profits would be at least \u00a386m. Greggs made a pre-tax profit of \u00a381.8m in 2017. Greggs has increased sales and profits despite a tough backdrop for high-street retailers struggling with rising business costs, a switch to online spending and faltering consumer confidence as Brexit looms. Whiteside said that sales at its high-street shops were still growing \u2013 albeit at a slower rate than its stores at other locations such as railway stations, retail parks and service stations \u2013 helped by strong demand for its breakfast ranges as well as its traditional steak bakes and sausage rolls. \u201cI think it demonstrates how our business has changed,\u201d he said. \u201cOur high-street shops are less reliant on shopping missions and that\u2019s making us more resilient. People working on the high street are coming in for breakfast before the shops are open.\u201d Total sales rose 7.2% in the year to 29 December, while like-for-like sales \u2013 stripping out the impact of sales in shops open for less than a year \u2013 increased by 2.9%. In the fourth quarter alone, like-for-like sales were up 5.2%. Greggs has prided itself on making changes to the products on offer to suit changing consumer tastes, including a greater focus on the \u201cfood-on-the-go market\u201d as well as the traditional bakery lines. Whiteside said: \u201cIn the year ahead we will continue to innovate with products designed to reflect changing consumer tastes and by opening in new locations that make Greggs even more accessible to customers.\u201d The bakery chain opened 149 shops in 2018 and closed 50. Whiteside said the number of Greggs stores would pass the 2,000 mark this year and the plan thereafter was to open about 100 shops a year until it reaches 2,500.",

It\u2019s the setting that JFK used to tell the country about life-threatening Cuban missiles. It\u2019s where George W Bush tried to calm the country after 9/11.</p> \n<p>Speaking robotically and looking isolated and lonely, the president tried to sell his unnecessary and inhumane $5bn border wall using stale arguments we have heard many times before. The speech sounded like campaign rhetoric and contained nothing new. In a fundraising letter I received by email in the afternoon, the president\u2019s naked political aims were obvious.</p> \n<p>\u201cI want to know who stood with me when it mattered most so I\u2019ve asked my team to send me a list of EVERY AMERICAN PATRIOT who donates to the Official Secure the Border Fund.\u201d Then came the tin cup.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Mainly the speech was the same litany of lies Trump has told to try to strong-arm Congress into paying for his wall</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cPlease make a special contribution of $5 by 9PM EST to our Official Secure the Border Fund to have your name sent to me after my speech.\u201d After the short speech, another fundraising plea arrived, extending the deadline.</p> \n<p>In the speech, he unsuccessfully argued (as he has all along) that the Democrats are to blame for the government shutdown that has already lasted 19 days, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-the-longest-government-shutdown-every-government-shutdown-and-how-long-they-lasted/\" title=\"\">the second longest ever</a>. The only reason the government is shut down is because of Trump\u2019s stubborn demand that his wall be funded.</p> \n<p>There was some criticism of the television networks for agreeing to forgo regular programming to carry the president\u2019s first Oval Office address live. While it\u2019s normal to grant such presidential requests, this is not a normal presidency and the musty, blatantly partisan speech the president gave creates a strong case for turning him down next time.</p> \n<p>Mainly the speech was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/08/trump-fact-check-speech-immigration-border-security\" title=\"\">same litany of lies</a> the president has told to try to strong-arm Congress into paying for his wall. He actually dropped one of his administration\u2019s lies \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/fact-check-did-u-s-catch-4-000-terrorists-southern-n954796\" title=\"\">that 4,000 terrorists</a> have crossed into the country from the porous southern border. His press secretary, Sarah Sanders, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/01/07/sarah-sanders-border-terrorist-claim-fox-news-fact-check-intv-es-vpx.cnn\" title=\"\">got demolished on Fox News</a> over the weekend when anchor Chris Wallace revealed the claim to be nonsense. The State Department has said that no terrorists have been found crossing the southern border from Mexico into the US, and said in a <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/283100.pdf\" title=\"\">2017 report</a> that there was \u201cno credible evidence\u201d indicating that international terrorist groups have established bases in Mexico or sent operatives into the US.</p> \n<p>He also added a couple of new whoppers. The first was that Democrats want the wall to be steel, not concrete. The second was a pathetic attempt to fulfil his promise that Mexico would pay for his wall by claiming that a new trade deal with Mexico will generate the equivalent of the cost of the wall.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b277d5a7-5fbc-4dca-92c1-6487e6ea657b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TjGCPTZKX5Y?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He did a little shape-shifting. Instead of framing his faux crisis mainly as a national security crisis that requires the involvement of American troops, he called it a humanitarian crisis. He invoked a \u201ccrisis of the soul\u201d, and the suffering of children in detention, but he looked uncomfortable even saying the word soul. He spoke of a \u201ccycle of human suffering that I am determined to end\u201d.</p> \n<p>The only time the president seemed revved-up was during the gory part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/09/donald-trumps-border-wall-speech-in-full\" title=\"\">his script</a>, when he recited a litany of brutal murders of Americans by \u201cillegal aliens\u201d. The cheapest line in the speech was asking, \u201cHow much more American blood must be shed for Congress to do its job?\u201d.</p> \n<p>Even the lies were stale. There is no flood of illegal immigrants coming across the 1,900-mile border with Mexico. Numbers are down from a peak in 2000. What\u2019s different and more tragic now is the number of migrants traveling with children. In November, the number of migrant families with children exceeded 25,000 \u2013 the highest number ever recorded.</p> \n<p>The heroin and fentanyl that the president used as an ingredient of his crisis do not come across the southern border. According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/skinosian/status/1081285709477044224\" title=\"\">drug threat assessments from the Drug Enforcement Administration</a>, the majority of the drugs that cross the border are brought in through official ports of entry. This has been the case for years. There are certainly grave humanitarian problems at the border, but they are almost all caused by the Trump administration\u2019s cruel arrest, detention and asylum policies. Many of the new Trump immigration edicts, unsurprisingly, have been struck down by federal courts.</p> \n<p>Two children have already died. Children are being housed in detention centers built for single male adults that were never intended for children. Then there are the hundreds of migrants for whom there is no adequate shelter who are being literally dumped by Trump administration officials on to the streets of cities like El Paso. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with the symptoms of the root cause, which is the lack of a rational immigration policy from Washington, and both sides are culpable,\u201d Dee Margo, the mayor of El Paso, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/mexico-wall-policy-trump.html\" title=\"\">told the New York Times</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/09/border-wall-speech-trump-is-losing-the-macho-game-of-staring-himself-down-in-the-mirror\">Border wall speech: Trump is losing the macho game of staring himself down in the mirror | Richard Wolffe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>By making asylum requests nearly impossible to process, the people waiting to file are being detained for much lengthier periods. They are arriving sicker. The number of detainees at Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities has reached its highest point ever, with an average daily population of 45,200 single adults and family units.</p> \n<p>The presidential address was so lame that it seemed to have taken the steam out of the rebuttal delivered by the Democratic leaders, too. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who spoke first, said the government could easily re-open if the shutdown and border security were decoupled. That\u2019s common sense, and even Republicans are growing impatient with the shutdown. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/09/pelosi-and-schumer-reply-to-trumps-border-wall-speech-in-full\" title=\"\">accused Trump</a> of appealing \u201cto fear not facts\u201d and governing by \u201ctemper tantrum\u201d.</p> \n<p>The politically inspired crisis is a familiar Trump ploy. In the weeks leading up to the November election, Trump used the \u201ccaravan invasion\u201d to declare a grave national security threat. Then he lost the House to the Democrats and suddenly there were no more presidential tweets about the so-called invasion.</p> \n<p>This speech was such a nothing that it left some in the audience wondering whether the urgency the White House claimed was intended to distract from the raft of new revelations from Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. For Donald Trump, that\u2019s a real crisis.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Jill Abramson is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump is a master at manufacturing faux crises. He is not a master at faking humanitarian concern. He thought that speaking from the Oval Office and sitting behind the Resolute desk would help him invoke a grave national crisis. It\u2019s the setting that JFK used to tell the country about life-threatening Cuban missiles. It\u2019s where George W Bush tried to calm the country after 9/11. Speaking robotically and looking isolated and lonely, the president tried to sell his unnecessary and inhumane $5bn border wall using stale arguments we have heard many times before. The speech sounded like campaign rhetoric and contained nothing new. In a fundraising letter I received by email in the afternoon, the president\u2019s naked political aims were obvious. \u201cI want to know who stood with me when it mattered most so I\u2019ve asked my team to send me a list of EVERY AMERICAN PATRIOT who donates to the Official Secure the Border Fund.\u201d Then came the tin cup. \u201cPlease make a special contribution of $5 by 9PM EST to our Official Secure the Border Fund to have your name sent to me after my speech.\u201d After the short speech, another fundraising plea arrived, extending the deadline. In the speech, he unsuccessfully argued (as he has all along) that the Democrats are to blame for the government shutdown that has already lasted 19 days, the second longest ever. The only reason the government is shut down is because of Trump\u2019s stubborn demand that his wall be funded. There was some criticism of the television networks for agreeing to forgo regular programming to carry the president\u2019s first Oval Office address live. While it\u2019s normal to grant such presidential requests, this is not a normal presidency and the musty, blatantly partisan speech the president gave creates a strong case for turning him down next time. Mainly the speech was the same litany of lies the president has told to try to strong-arm Congress into paying for his wall. He actually dropped one of his administration\u2019s lies \u2013 that 4,000 terrorists have crossed into the country from the porous southern border. His press secretary, Sarah Sanders, got demolished on Fox News over the weekend when anchor Chris Wallace revealed the claim to be nonsense. The State Department has said that no terrorists have been found crossing the southern border from Mexico into the US, and said in a 2017 report that there was \u201cno credible evidence\u201d indicating that international terrorist groups have established bases in Mexico or sent operatives into the US. He also added a couple of new whoppers. The first was that Democrats want the wall to be steel, not concrete. The second was a pathetic attempt to fulfil his promise that Mexico would pay for his wall by claiming that a new trade deal with Mexico will generate the equivalent of the cost of the wall. He did a little shape-shifting. Instead of framing his faux crisis mainly as a national security crisis that requires the involvement of American troops, he called it a humanitarian crisis. He invoked a \u201ccrisis of the soul\u201d, and the suffering of children in detention, but he looked uncomfortable even saying the word soul. He spoke of a \u201ccycle of human suffering that I am determined to end\u201d. The only time the president seemed revved-up was during the gory part of his script, when he recited a litany of brutal murders of Americans by \u201cillegal aliens\u201d. The cheapest line in the speech was asking, \u201cHow much more American blood must be shed for Congress to do its job?\u201d. Even the lies were stale. There is no flood of illegal immigrants coming across the 1,900-mile border with Mexico. Numbers are down from a peak in 2000. What\u2019s different and more tragic now is the number of migrants traveling with children. In November, the number of migrant families with children exceeded 25,000 \u2013 the highest number ever recorded. The heroin and fentanyl that the president used as an ingredient of his crisis do not come across the southern border. According to drug threat assessments from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the majority of the drugs that cross the border are brought in through official ports of entry. This has been the case for years. There are certainly grave humanitarian problems at the border, but they are almost all caused by the Trump administration\u2019s cruel arrest, detention and asylum policies. Many of the new Trump immigration edicts, unsurprisingly, have been struck down by federal courts. Two children have already died. Children are being housed in detention centers built for single male adults that were never intended for children. Then there are the hundreds of migrants for whom there is no adequate shelter who are being literally dumped by Trump administration officials on to the streets of cities like El Paso. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with the symptoms of the root cause, which is the lack of a rational immigration policy from Washington, and both sides are culpable,\u201d Dee Margo, the mayor of El Paso, told the New York Times. By making asylum requests nearly impossible to process, the people waiting to file are being detained for much lengthier periods. They are arriving sicker. The number of detainees at Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities has reached its highest point ever, with an average daily population of 45,200 single adults and family units. The presidential address was so lame that it seemed to have taken the steam out of the rebuttal delivered by the Democratic leaders, too. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who spoke first, said the government could easily re-open if the shutdown and border security were decoupled. That\u2019s common sense, and even Republicans are growing impatient with the shutdown. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer accused Trump of appealing \u201cto fear not facts\u201d and governing by \u201ctemper tantrum\u201d. The politically inspired crisis is a familiar Trump ploy. In the weeks leading up to the November election, Trump used the \u201ccaravan invasion\u201d to declare a grave national security threat. Then he lost the House to the Democrats and suddenly there were no more presidential tweets about the so-called invasion. This speech was such a nothing that it left some in the audience wondering whether the urgency the White House claimed was intended to distract from the raft of new revelations from Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. For Donald Trump, that\u2019s a real crisis. \u2022 Jill Abramson is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>Peter Swinnerton-Dyer, who has died aged 91, is famous among mathematicians as one author of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture in number theory. Published in 1965, this was immediately influential, becoming even more prominent in 1999 as one of the <a href=\"http://www.claymath.org/\" title=\"\">Clay Mathematics Institute</a>\u2019s seven $1m Millennium Prize Problems, alongside the Riemann hypothesis.</p> <p>Swinnerton-Dyer\u2019s first published paper appeared in 1943, when he was 16 and still at school. His most recent publications, which are substantial, date from 2012-16, and he was pursuing major new research directions well into his final year. In between he served as master of St Catharine\u2019s College, Cambridge, and vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, before moving to the civil service as chair of the University Grants Committee (UGC).</p> <p>The B-SD conjecture was made on the basis of computer calculations, the first serious application of computers in pure mathematical research. However, the computing facilities available at the time were rudimentary; to the point that Swinnerton-Dyer himself wrote the first operating system for Titan, the successor at the Cambridge Computer Laboratory to the EDSAC2 on which he carried out the computations with <a href=\"https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/bryan.birch\" title=\"\">Bryan Birch</a>. He later described himself on occasions as a computer scientist masquerading as a pure mathematician.</p> <p>The B-SD conjecture states that, given a cubic equation in two variables with integer coefficients, the number of rational solutions is governed in a precise way by the L-function of the elliptic curve it defines. (L-functions of elliptic curves also play a central role in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/mar/15/british-mathematician-andrew-wiles-abel-prize-fermats-last-theorem-proof\" title=\"\">Andrew Wiles\u2019s proof of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem</a>.) While the B-SD conjecture is a key problem in modern mathematics, and much is known about it, a complete proof remains elusive.</p> <p>In view of modern applications of number theory to cryptography and internet security, workable solutions to problems around B-SD might be worth a great deal more than a million dollars to well-informed cybercriminals or their opponents.</p> <p>Swinnerton-Dyer was born at Ponteland, Northumberland, the son of Sir Leonard Swinnerton-Dyer and his wife, Barbara (nee Brackenbury). The family moved to Shropshire early in Peter\u2019s childhood. His father, as well as being a baronet and member of the landed gentry, was an engineer and successful businessman, and chair of several companies. He was also a well-known figure in British chess circles, but Peter was the first in his family to go to university. He read a lot and enjoyed doing sums; his mother supported his academic ambitions and his local school teacher recognised his mathematical aptitude.</p> <p>He won a scholarship to Eton and in 1945 went to Trinity College, Cambridge. As a graduate student he studied under JE Littlewood, but never completed a PhD. However, in 1950 he became a fellow of Trinity, and remained there until 1973, with a crucial year\u2019s visit to Chicago in the 1950s, where he worked with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/10/nyregion/andre-weil-who-reshaped-mathematics-is-dead-at-92.html\" title=\"\">Andr\u00e9 Weil</a>, an influence that set him on course to the famous conjecture and to much else besides.</p> <p>Swinnerton-Dyer\u2019s role at Trinity included a spell as dean, responsible for discipline. His sympathy with students and liking for their company (especially with cider, or evening board games) made him a less than feared figure (the family motto is <em>Terrere nolo timere nescio</em>, roughly \u201cUnthreatening; undaunted\u201d). In 1973, at the relatively young age of 46, he was elected master of St Catharine\u2019s. He remained there for 10 years, frequently preferring student company to that of the fellows. During this time the character of the college was enriched by the admission of women. </p> <p>The year 1983 brought abrupt change: he resigned from St Catharine\u2019s, took up the UGC chair, and married the archaeologist Harriet Crawford. This was a turbulent time in university finances: Swinnerton-Dyer worked closely with the education secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1994/dec/12/obituaries\" title=\"\">Sir Keith Joseph</a>.</p> <p>Though himself an SDP member, he respected both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher </a>and Joseph and was influential in informing them of the importance of research quality in judging universities. While by no means perfect, the research assessment system then introduced contributed to the competitiveness of UK universities in the world. He left the Universities Funding Council (successor to the UGC) in 1991. </p> <p>Swinnerton-Dyer was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1967, succeeded his father as 16th baronet in 1975 and was knighted in 1987. He won the Sylvester medal of the Royal Society and the 2006 P\u00f3lya prize of the <a href=\"https://www.lms.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">London Mathematical Society</a>, and was awarded honorary degrees at Bath and Warwick universities.</p> <p>Even as head of the UGC-UFC, he had never ceased to do mathematics, and published several major papers during the 80s. His mathematical work was remarkable for its originality, freely mixing ideas from different areas to attain unexpected insights. He was fearless in his choice of problems. From the 90s, he pursued work on 2-descent (a method going back to Fermat) as a way to study rational points on varieties fibred in elliptic curves; the aim being practical calculations to determine for interesting classes of algebraic surfaces (and so on) whether rational points exist, and if so, how many.</p> <p>This sometimes involved highbrow modern theory, but not as a first preference. The quest for a beautiful theory never ruled out cobbling together a messy or convoluted solution that actually worked. Despite the seemingly modest viewpoint, Swinnerton-Dyer obtained very significant results, several in areas previously considered intractable. One of his papers was conceived while on a tour of eastern Anatolia with Harriet: latterly he often accompanied her to archaeological meetings.</p> <p>Stories about Swinnerton-Dyer abound. In addition to his love of student company and board games, he was more than competent at squash, tennis and real tennis. He played chess well and bridge to international standard: he was part of the British team that came second in the 1953 European championship.</p> <p>In a tournament, Swinnerton-Dyer once scuttled his opponents\u2019 grand slam by bidding eight clubs; the rules at the time invalidated an impossible bid made by mistake or oversight, so he first informed the tournament director that his bid was intentional. The rules of bridge were subsequently revised to prevent this.</p> <p>Swinnerton-Dyer was an inspirational if idiosyncratic teacher. His genial personality, exceptional erudition and generous support for students and younger colleagues won him many lasting friends.</p> <p>His wife survives him.</p> <p>\u2022 Henry Peter Francis Swinnerton-Dyer, mathematician, university administrator and civil servant, born 2 August 1927; died 26 December 2018</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 January 2019, to correct Peter Swinnerton-Dyer\u2019s father\u2019s name to Leonard.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Peter Swinnerton-Dyer, who has died aged 91, is famous among mathematicians as one author of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture in number theory. Published in 1965, this was immediately influential, becoming even more prominent in 1999 as one of the Clay Mathematics Institute\u2019s seven $1m Millennium Prize Problems, alongside the Riemann hypothesis. Swinnerton-Dyer\u2019s first published paper appeared in 1943, when he was 16 and still at school. His most recent publications, which are substantial, date from 2012-16, and he was pursuing major new research directions well into his final year. In between he served as master of St Catharine\u2019s College, Cambridge, and vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, before moving to the civil service as chair of the University Grants Committee (UGC). The B-SD conjecture was made on the basis of computer calculations, the first serious application of computers in pure mathematical research. However, the computing facilities available at the time were rudimentary; to the point that Swinnerton-Dyer himself wrote the first operating system for Titan, the successor at the Cambridge Computer Laboratory to the EDSAC2 on which he carried out the computations with Bryan Birch. He later described himself on occasions as a computer scientist masquerading as a pure mathematician. The B-SD conjecture states that, given a cubic equation in two variables with integer coefficients, the number of rational solutions is governed in a precise way by the L-function of the elliptic curve it defines. (L-functions of elliptic curves also play a central role in Andrew Wiles\u2019s proof of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem.) While the B-SD conjecture is a key problem in modern mathematics, and much is known about it, a complete proof remains elusive. In view of modern applications of number theory to cryptography and internet security, workable solutions to problems around B-SD might be worth a great deal more than a million dollars to well-informed cybercriminals or their opponents. Swinnerton-Dyer was born at Ponteland, Northumberland, the son of Sir Leonard Swinnerton-Dyer and his wife, Barbara (nee Brackenbury). The family moved to Shropshire early in Peter\u2019s childhood. His father, as well as being a baronet and member of the landed gentry, was an engineer and successful businessman, and chair of several companies. He was also a well-known figure in British chess circles, but Peter was the first in his family to go to university. He read a lot and enjoyed doing sums; his mother supported his academic ambitions and his local school teacher recognised his mathematical aptitude. He won a scholarship to Eton and in 1945 went to Trinity College, Cambridge. As a graduate student he studied under JE Littlewood, but never completed a PhD. However, in 1950 he became a fellow of Trinity, and remained there until 1973, with a crucial year\u2019s visit to Chicago in the 1950s, where he worked with Andr\u00e9 Weil, an influence that set him on course to the famous conjecture and to much else besides. Swinnerton-Dyer\u2019s role at Trinity included a spell as dean, responsible for discipline. His sympathy with students and liking for their company (especially with cider, or evening board games) made him a less than feared figure (the family motto is Terrere nolo timere nescio, roughly \u201cUnthreatening; undaunted\u201d). In 1973, at the relatively young age of 46, he was elected master of St Catharine\u2019s. He remained there for 10 years, frequently preferring student company to that of the fellows. During this time the character of the college was enriched by the admission of women. The year 1983 brought abrupt change: he resigned from St Catharine\u2019s, took up the UGC chair, and married the archaeologist Harriet Crawford. This was a turbulent time in university finances: Swinnerton-Dyer worked closely with the education secretary Sir Keith Joseph. Though himself an SDP member, he respected both Margaret Thatcher and Joseph and was influential in informing them of the importance of research quality in judging universities. While by no means perfect, the research assessment system then introduced contributed to the competitiveness of UK universities in the world. He left the Universities Funding Council (successor to the UGC) in 1991. Swinnerton-Dyer was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1967, succeeded his father as 16th baronet in 1975 and was knighted in 1987. He won the Sylvester medal of the Royal Society and the 2006 P\u00f3lya prize of the London Mathematical Society, and was awarded honorary degrees at Bath and Warwick universities. Even as head of the UGC-UFC, he had never ceased to do mathematics, and published several major papers during the 80s. His mathematical work was remarkable for its originality, freely mixing ideas from different areas to attain unexpected insights. He was fearless in his choice of problems. From the 90s, he pursued work on 2-descent (a method going back to Fermat) as a way to study rational points on varieties fibred in elliptic curves; the aim being practical calculations to determine for interesting classes of algebraic surfaces (and so on) whether rational points exist, and if so, how many. This sometimes involved highbrow modern theory, but not as a first preference. The quest for a beautiful theory never ruled out cobbling together a messy or convoluted solution that actually worked. Despite the seemingly modest viewpoint, Swinnerton-Dyer obtained very significant results, several in areas previously considered intractable. One of his papers was conceived while on a tour of eastern Anatolia with Harriet: latterly he often accompanied her to archaeological meetings. Stories about Swinnerton-Dyer abound. In addition to his love of student company and board games, he was more than competent at squash, tennis and real tennis. He played chess well and bridge to international standard: he was part of the British team that came second in the 1953 European championship. In a tournament, Swinnerton-Dyer once scuttled his opponents\u2019 grand slam by bidding eight clubs; the rules at the time invalidated an impossible bid made by mistake or oversight, so he first informed the tournament director that his bid was intentional. The rules of bridge were subsequently revised to prevent this. Swinnerton-Dyer was an inspirational if idiosyncratic teacher. His genial personality, exceptional erudition and generous support for students and younger colleagues won him many lasting friends. His wife survives him. \u2022 Henry Peter Francis Swinnerton-Dyer, mathematician, university administrator and civil servant, born 2 August 1927; died 26 December 2018 \u2022 This article was amended on 11 January 2019, to correct Peter Swinnerton-Dyer\u2019s father\u2019s name to Leonard.",

Speaking before the resumption of the Commons debate on her proposals, which will culminate next Tuesday in a vote postponed from December, May insisted she could reassure MPs about the backstop. But Jeremy Corbyn, who used all his questions to focus on Brexit, urged May to rule out the possibility of a no-deal departure and said that if she lost next week\u2019s vote she should \u201clet the people have a real say\u201d by calling a general election. The Labour leader began by saying May had failed to get any further assurances from EU leaders on the backstop, the insurance policy that would prevent a hard Irish border in the event of no permanent trade deal by keeping Northern Ireland under some EU regulations for an interim period. \u201cIsn\u2019t the PM bringing back exactly the same deal she admitted would be defeated four weeks ago?\u201d he asked. May responded by saying she had gained new EU assurances with legal status, adding: \u201cThese discussions have shown that further clarification on the backstop is possible, and those talks will continue over the next few days.\u201d She highlighted the government\u2019s new package of methods for Northern Ireland to have a say on the backstop, if it came into effect.

However, Corbyn said May was offering only \u201cwindow dressing\u201d, and predicted the deal would be voted down. The prime minister, he said, was \u201crecklessly wasting time, holding the country to ransom with the threat of no deal, in a desperate attempt to blackmail MPs to vote for her hopelessly unpopular deal\u201d.

A team cannot plan to be terrible in two years\u2019 time and tank for the top pick. Our most recent example of a similar prospect is Andrew Luck, and it took a bizarre set of circumstances for the Colts to be happy throwing a season away in order to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2011/10/21/us/suck-for-luck-could-be-best-hope-for-nfls-worst/index.html\">Suck for Luck</a>. Tanking for Trevor won\u2019t be quite as easy. What\u2019s the incentive for a coaching staff? If you wind up 1-15 you will be fired even as a first-year coach, as Arizona\u2019s Steve Wilks can attest.<br><br>That makes plotting for the top pick tough. But you can tip the scales in your favor by collecting as many 2021 picks as possible. Perhaps the team selecting No 1 overall in two years\u2019 time already has their quarterback of the future. Or maybe they don\u2019t fall in love with Lawrence as much as other teams. Or maybe they think accepting a boatload of draft picks is a better use of resources than selecting a lone passer, as Cleveland did when they <a href=\"https://247sports.com/nfl/cleveland-browns/Article/Cleveland-Browns-Carson-Wentz-Trade-Finally-Complete-What-It-Was-1-117814804/\">let Philadelphia jump up to select Carson Wentz</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/09/its-time-to-pay-the-tab-for-americas-college-athletes\">It's time to pay the tab for America's college athletes | Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The league has two more years to nit-pick Lawrence. Every throw, every decision, on and off-the-field will be hyper-analyzed, all through the prism of his draft stock. Then again, with his physical tools alone he would be a top-10 lock this year. And he still has another two years to add muscle to his giant 6ft 5in frame (and get a decent haircut) before heading to the big show.</p> <p>Yet good quarterback play at the NFL level isn\u2019t always spectacular. It resides in the absence of spectacle: setting and resetting protections, making sure the team checks from a bad play to a good one, getting the ball out hot, and the bravery to take a shot in order to complete a throw. Lawrence has already mastered the game within a game. He is more of a chess player \u2013 a manipulator \u2013 than any top draft choice since Luck. And he seems immune to pressure, regardless of the moment and regardless of the blitz.</p> <p>NFL teams are already circling. For perennial losers or teams lacking a long-term solution at quarterback, every decision, every action between now and the 2021 draft will be made with a view to grabbing Lawrence.</p>",

Our most recent example of a similar prospect is Andrew Luck, and it took a bizarre set of circumstances for the Colts to be happy throwing a season away in order to Suck for Luck. Tanking for Trevor won\u2019t be quite as easy. What\u2019s the incentive for a coaching staff? If you wind up 1-15 you will be fired even as a first-year coach, as Arizona\u2019s Steve Wilks can attest. That makes plotting for the top pick tough. But you can tip the scales in your favor by collecting as many 2021 picks as possible. Perhaps the team selecting No 1 overall in two years\u2019 time already has their quarterback of the future. Or maybe they don\u2019t fall in love with Lawrence as much as other teams. Or maybe they think accepting a boatload of draft picks is a better use of resources than selecting a lone passer, as Cleveland did when they let Philadelphia jump up to select Carson Wentz. The league has two more years to nit-pick Lawrence. Every throw, every decision, on and off-the-field will be hyper-analyzed, all through the prism of his draft stock. Then again, with his physical tools alone he would be a top-10 lock this year. And he still has another two years to add muscle to his giant 6ft 5in frame (and get a decent haircut) before heading to the big show. Yet good quarterback play at the NFL level isn\u2019t always spectacular. It resides in the absence of spectacle: setting and resetting protections, making sure the team checks from a bad play to a good one, getting the ball out hot, and the bravery to take a shot in order to complete a throw. Lawrence has already mastered the game within a game. He is more of a chess player \u2013 a manipulator \u2013 than any top draft choice since Luck. And he seems immune to pressure, regardless of the moment and regardless of the blitz. NFL teams are already circling. For perennial losers or teams lacking a long-term solution at quarterback, every decision, every action between now and the 2021 draft will be made with a view to grabbing Lawrence.",

      "bodyText": "The productivity growth of British workers fell to a two-year low in the third quarter of last year, according to official figures released amid warnings that failures of government policy and Brexit are holding back efficiency gains. According to the Office for National Statistics, annual growth in economic output per hour of work slumped to 0.2% in the three months to September, down from 1.6% in the second quarter and marking the weakest period since the third quarter of 2016. The latest snapshot underlines the continuation of Britain\u2019s dismal track record since the financial crisis on improving labour productivity, which is vital for economic growth and raising workers\u2019 wages. While the UK has managed to grow employment to record levels, with the jobless rate the lowest since the mid-1970s, the rate of growth in productivity languishes at about one-tenth of the average observed before the 2008 crash. Economists argue that many of the jobs created since the financial crisis have been in low-paid sectors where productivity is limited, acting as a drag on growth. Britain also has a poor track record in investing in technology, skills and training that could lift the rate of growth. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said it was possible that companies had chosen to take on more staff in recent months instead of making more investments in productivity-boosting technologies, given the heightened uncertainty over Brexit. Business investment has fallen for three quarters, the worst period since the financial crisis, which potentially paves the way for weak productivity growth in future. \u201cThe low cost of labour relative to capital has certainly supported employment over investment,\u201d he said. Improving labour productivity is a key government priority, forming the backbone of the industrial strategy, although lobby groups and Labour politicians warn too little is being achieved. Tej Parikh, a senior economist at the Institute of Directors, said the strategy had been sidelined by Brexit talks and Whitehall preparations to leave the EU. \u201cWe need more [government] support for skills, infrastructure and technological development at national and regional levels,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately, with uncertainty hitting business investment and limiting policy headway last year we are unlikely to see a boom in productivity anytime soon.\u201d",

Separately, the FTA has prepared a shopping list of critical \u201cmini-deals\u201d it says the government must urgently seek from Brussels to ensure Britain keeps trading. Top of the list are enough permits for lorry drivers to continue to transport goods, and a concrete no-deal aviation plan to keep cargo flights running. It is also calling for an \u201capproved exporter system\u201d to enable companies to avoid having to fill in documents for each consignment they export or import and to strive to act as \u201cone government at the border\u201d. The Road Haulage Association has said the existing government customs declarations forms, for example, are so long and impractical it would take eight hours to clear an average lorry travelling from Calais to Dover. Pauline Bastidon, the FTA\u2019s head of European policy and Brexit, said the EU\u2019s limited no-deal contingency plans would not allow trade to flow freely. \u201cProposals for aviation and road haulage, which FTA had relentlessly campaigned for in Brussels and other European capitals, are only temporary and could be revoked by the European commission at any time,\u201d she said. \u201cLogistics is the beating heart of the economy, and one on which most businesses \u2013 including manufacturing plants, hospitals and shops \u2013 have come to rely on,\u201d she added. She said the industry was ready to take action but with just 80 days to go to 29 March it urgently needed \u201cclear directions and a supportive environment\u201d to avoid catastrophe. The French authorities in Calais said last month they were so concerned about no deal that they were putting advanced contingency plans in place. They are building temporary border inspection posts near the port for the mandatory checks on food and live animals that will be required after Brexit in a no-deal scenario. The Calais port\u2019s boss, Jean-Marc Puissesseau, insisted that it would not be the cause of delays across the channel. At present, 10,000 trucks a day cross the Channel between Dover and Calais at peak times.

If you have to tell people you are, you aren\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s a lesson that could usefully be learned by Gavin Williamson, the elfin defence secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/02/gavin-williamson-profile-an-ambitious-chop-your-head-off-type-of-man\" title=\"\">who longs to inherit her job</a>.</p> <p>Like a one-man military band, Williamson spent the Christmas period blowing the trumpet, twirling the baton and banging the drum for Brexit Britain.

Yet like so many delusions, it has deep historical roots. It has bedevilled British diplomacy since 1945, souring its relations not only with the EU but with the Commonwealth countries to whom Williamson makes his pitch.</p> <p>At the end of the second world war, Britain\u2019s commitment to global leadership remained undimmed \u2013 despite its severe reduction in power. So governments of both parties turned to the Commonwealth as an organisation that \u201chas only to develop its resources to match the power of the United States\u201d.</p> <p>Yet hopes that the Commonwealth would serve as a proxy empire, retaining the benefits of the imperial connection without its unfashionable colonial regalia, were swiftly disappointed. What had once been a gathering of white, Anglo-Saxon statesmen became less white, less \u201cBritish\u201d and less deferent to instructions from Whitehall. The result was a backlash against the organisation that anticipated later criticism of the EU.</p> <p>In the 1970s and 80s, the Commonwealth featured in public debate chiefly as a problem: it was a body that did things to Britain, rather than for it, and which allowed ungrateful foreigners to fleece Britain of cash, interfere in its affairs and take advantage of its immigration laws. Britain, complained a Scottish newspaper, had become \u201cthe old convenient milk cow\u201d, wielding \u201cthe ever-open wallet on which the sun never sets\u201d. Enoch Powell dismissed the organisation as a \u201chumbug\u201d \u2013 while more recently, Boris Johnson joked that its main purpose was to provide the Queen with <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3571742/If-Blairs-so-good-at-running-the-Congo-let-him-stay-there.html\" title=\"\">\u201ccheering crowds of flag-waving piccaninnies\u201d</a>.</p> <p>As the hopes vested in the Commonwealth began to fade, governments did not adjust their ambitions. Instead, they transferred them to the European Economic Community. It was economic weakness that pushed governments towards membership; but like the shipwrecked children in a Victorian adventure story, who crawl to shore and promptly declare themselves king and queen, policymakers rarely doubted that Britain\u2019s rightful place in Europe was at its head. George Brown, a Labour foreign secretary, urged Willy Brandt in 1967 \u201cto let us in\u201d so we can \u201ctake the lead\u201d. His boss, Harold Wilson, wrote privately that \u201cif we couldn\u2019t dominate that lot, there wasn\u2019t much to be said for us\u201d.</p> <p>For Thatcher, likewise, Europe was simply a new vehicle for Britain\u2019s historic vocation to power: an impulse that had \u201ccarried our flags, our trade, our culture and our justice to the corners of the earth\u201d. It was \u201cthis traditional outward-looking role\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/102647\" title=\"\">she declared</a>, that had brought Britain into the EEC, for \u201cwhere power resides, there must British influence be exerted\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/07/britain-commonwealth-trading-empire-brexit-eu-trade\">Britain sees the Commonwealth as its trading empire.

      "bodyText": "\u201cBeing powerful,\u201d Margaret Thatcher once said, \u201cis like being a lady. If you have to tell people you are, you aren\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s a lesson that could usefully be learned by Gavin Williamson, the elfin defence secretary who longs to inherit her job. Like a one-man military band, Williamson spent the Christmas period blowing the trumpet, twirling the baton and banging the drum for Brexit Britain. Leaving the EU, he told the Daily Telegraph, would restore Britain as \u201ca truly global player\u201d, determined once again to \u201cplay the role on the world stage that the world expects us to play\u201d. Post Brexit, \u201cAustralia, Canada, New Zealand, Caribbean countries\u201d and \u201cnations right across Africa\u201d would \u201clook to us to provide the moral leadership, the military leadership and the global leadership\u201d of which they had been too long deprived. The fantasy of a world that longs for British \u201cleadership\u201d is a bold claim from a government that can barely tie its own shoelaces. Yet like so many delusions, it has deep historical roots. It has bedevilled British diplomacy since 1945, souring its relations not only with the EU but with the Commonwealth countries to whom Williamson makes his pitch. At the end of the second world war, Britain\u2019s commitment to global leadership remained undimmed \u2013 despite its severe reduction in power. So governments of both parties turned to the Commonwealth as an organisation that \u201chas only to develop its resources to match the power of the United States\u201d. Yet hopes that the Commonwealth would serve as a proxy empire, retaining the benefits of the imperial connection without its unfashionable colonial regalia, were swiftly disappointed. What had once been a gathering of white, Anglo-Saxon statesmen became less white, less \u201cBritish\u201d and less deferent to instructions from Whitehall. The result was a backlash against the organisation that anticipated later criticism of the EU. In the 1970s and 80s, the Commonwealth featured in public debate chiefly as a problem: it was a body that did things to Britain, rather than for it, and which allowed ungrateful foreigners to fleece Britain of cash, interfere in its affairs and take advantage of its immigration laws. Britain, complained a Scottish newspaper, had become \u201cthe old convenient milk cow\u201d, wielding \u201cthe ever-open wallet on which the sun never sets\u201d. Enoch Powell dismissed the organisation as a \u201chumbug\u201d \u2013 while more recently, Boris Johnson joked that its main purpose was to provide the Queen with \u201ccheering crowds of flag-waving piccaninnies\u201d. As the hopes vested in the Commonwealth began to fade, governments did not adjust their ambitions. Instead, they transferred them to the European Economic Community. It was economic weakness that pushed governments towards membership; but like the shipwrecked children in a Victorian adventure story, who crawl to shore and promptly declare themselves king and queen, policymakers rarely doubted that Britain\u2019s rightful place in Europe was at its head. George Brown, a Labour foreign secretary, urged Willy Brandt in 1967 \u201cto let us in\u201d so we can \u201ctake the lead\u201d. His boss, Harold Wilson, wrote privately that \u201cif we couldn\u2019t dominate that lot, there wasn\u2019t much to be said for us\u201d. For Thatcher, likewise, Europe was simply a new vehicle for Britain\u2019s historic vocation to power: an impulse that had \u201ccarried our flags, our trade, our culture and our justice to the corners of the earth\u201d. It was \u201cthis traditional outward-looking role\u201d, she declared, that had brought Britain into the EEC, for \u201cwhere power resides, there must British influence be exerted\u201d. That view was echoed in the press. The Daily Mail celebrated accession with the headline \u201cNow we can lead Europe!\u201d, while the Sun told readers that membership offered \u201can unrepeatable opportunity for a nation that lost an empire to gain a continent\u201d. Such rhetoric continued into the 1990s and beyond. Tony Blair promised in 1997 to \u201cgive Britain the leadership in Europe which Britain and Europe need\u201d, and \u201cto use our leadership position\u201d to put Britain \u201cat the centre of international decision-making\u201d. Gordon Brown called his book on the 2016 referendum Britain: Leading, Not Leaving, insisting that \u201cBritain has always led the way when things have been difficult in Europe, and I think it\u2019s time that we were a leader again\u201d. David Cameron, likewise, proclaimed that Europe needed \u201c\u2018a big, bold, brave Britain at the heart of [its] institutions\u201d. Yet this set an impossible standard for membership of a multinational community. Successive governments persistently refused to re-imagine themselves as an equal partner \u2013 and, in the imagination of the Brexit right, if Britain could not be a king, it must be a \u201cvassal\u201d, a \u201cprisoner\u201d or a \u201ccolony\u201d. In consequence, Britain is fast becoming the King Lear of the diplomatic world: rampaging insanely around the stage and blaming everyone else for the loss of his kingdom: \u201cHow sharper than a serpent\u2019s tooth it is to have a thankless Commonwealth/continent!\u201d The liberation that Britain so urgently needs is not from Brussels, but from its own illusions.

Next to the United States representatives, round the corner of the table on the outside, came in order the French, Italian, and Belgian representatives.

On the other side of the horseshoe, to the left of M. Poincar\u00e9, next to the British delegation, sat the delegates from Canada, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, and India; and lastly the Japanese representatives.

The coincidence was probably designed, one of those strokes in which the historical and the aesthetic sense of France delights. The coincidence is one well worth meditating upon.</p> <p>In 1914 the German Empire had every air of being as solidly founded a political fabric as any in the world. At its head stood a Royal house which enjoyed popular esteem. It was governed by a bureaucracy which was a byword for patience and for skill. Its army was the strongest in the world. Its people one of the most laborious races in Europe. Its commerce was flourishing and expanding all over the globe. All this magnificent structure has collapsed. The German Empire has had not one of the longest, but one of the shortest lives among the empires in the history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/06/europeans-war-1918-armistice-empires\">For millions of Europeans, the war did not end in 1918 | Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What is the reason? Here is a fine subject for the historian, and the moralist. Yet the central reason is plain. We can accept Bismarck\u2019s own teaching that the German Empire was made by blood and iron. It was fashioned by violence and by a wholly amoral ruthlessness. In the deliberate philosophy of the makers of the German Empire it was a monument to the virtue of pure force and pure calculation, and its success was the vindication of pure force and pure calculation as sovereign remedies in politics. Up to the very eve of the war the German Empire and German statecraft were quoted as convincing rebukes to democracy. The German people sold liberty for the success of German Imperialism. Bismarck undertook to destroy the liberal movement in Germany by demonstrating that Biskmarckian statesmanship was the way to glory. No doubt in his case force was tempered by prudence, and we may well believe that he would not have made the mistake of provoking universal distrust and enmity and launching Germany into a war with whole world. But just as it is in the nature of great men to be succeeded by small men, so it was in the nature of his philosophy that in the hands of small men it should lead Germany to this disaster.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27b80dad8cf1763aa5238f365201f95f77d4c450\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27b80dad8cf1763aa5238f365201f95f77d4c450/0_510_2596_1557/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene during the Versailles peace conference, June 1919.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene during the Versailles peace conference, June 1919.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ENA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The essence of his gospel was force, and force intoxicated, except with those rare individuals who can coldly calculate the limits of bayonets. The fall of the German Empire is not in despite of Bismarck, but in consequence of Bismarck. It has collapsed because of his foundations.</p> <p>Two other great Empires \u2013 the Russian and the Austrian \u2013 passed out of history along with the German Empire. They were fit companions. So dulled is our imagination when actually living through great events that we fail to grasp their magnitude. We look upon the destruction of Austria and of Russia as inevitable, commonplace. Nevertheless, a few years ago what serious student would have foretold it?</p> <p>The search for morals in history requires much faith. We might conclude from the fall of three great Empires the old and not too comforting lesson of the mortality of human things. Even that would have its value if it served to tame the arrogance of political architects and to lend something of moderation and of tolerance, along with a dash of melancholy, to political speculation and political conflict. It is not without use to look at things from the standpoint of eternity. But in the tremendous events through which we are passing we may discover at least two other lessons of value to the world in the work of reconstruction upon which it is engaged.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/05/versailles-second-world-war\">The economic impact of the Treaty of Versailles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first is that force and amorality are a rotten foundation for states. M. Poincar\u00e9 tells us that justice must rule the deliberations of the peace conference. It is fine saying, and the Allied statesmen must be true to it in spirit and in word. They are under every sort of temptation to be false to it. They are the heirs of a bad tradition \u2013 the tradition of secrecy, the tradition of power, the tradition of barter. Again, there is nobody to resist them. The whole world is spread before them; they have but to stretch out their hands and take. To fortify them in resisting these temptations they have the moral spectacle of the destruction of three empires which acted as though force were the highest law. If the passionate desire of the peoples of the world for peace and justice should fail to convert the Allied statesmen, there is the powerful argument of Germany, Austria, and Russia that the way of violence and rapacious appetite does not prosper.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74-HkCRozls\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/74-HkCRozls?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The Treaty of Versailles. BBC via YouTube.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The second moral is that the fond belief that politics abhors the small state is erroneous. Whatever the ultimate aspect of Russia, Germany, and Austria-Hungary, it is certain that they will slough off many states. The peace conference will sanctify the birth or revival of a dozen new states in two continents. We need not enter into the rather sterile debate as to the rival merits of great states and little states. The world never was constituted entirely of the one or the other. The tide which for 50 years seemed to be running strongly towards the great state has definitely turned. The world of the future will see a balance between the great states and the little states. Both have their place in scheme of things. The Allied statesmen in conference would make a profound error if they thought the function of the small state was merely to adorn their triumphs or to be the instrument for their purposes. To create them in that spirit and with that object would be merely to establish the rule of force under a plausible mask. The old school of diplomacy, a school which is very far from dead, knew no other way of working, but if the peace conference were to follow it its work would lack stability and permanence. The small states and the small peoples must come into their rights for their own sakes.</p> <p><em>This is an edited extract. <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/01/07/Editorial_20_jan.jpg\">Read the full article.</a></em></p> <p><em>The treaty was signed on 28 June 1919 and took force on 10 January 1920.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d359693f44554f1bb77bb928ed73e154c6d7695\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d359693f44554f1bb77bb928ed73e154c6d7695/0_0_902_619/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Guardian, 12 January 1920.\" width=\"500\" height=\"343\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Guardian, 12 January 1920. <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/01/08/Peace_12_jan_1920..jpg\">Click to read full article. </a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Nelsson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

At the second, when a new world was to be created, men acted as if the event itself were so solemn that appearances were of little moment. Those who looked into the future felt that the expectations of mankind at this crisis would have needed for their full expression a religious leader rather than a statesman \u2013 an inspired fanatic rather than a self-possessed and eloquent speaker. Round the horseshoe table The simplicity of the scene was its most striking feature. There were not half a dozen uniforms round the table. Indeed this indifference to state was carried to excess, for, while one could admire the deliberate disregard of display, it was impossible not to regret that (owing to a mistake in the official programme supplied) the British Prime Minister\u2019s place at M. Poincar\u00e9\u2019s left hand was empty when the conference opened, and the presence of officials and secretaries scattered through the room gave a look almost of confusion to the scene. The several delegates were received by M. Pichon, and then they passed into the great Clock Room, where they gradually found their way to their places at this horseshoe table. On the right hand off M. Poincar\u00e9 sat the United States delegates, on the left the British. Next to the United States representatives, round the corner of the table on the outside, came in order the French, Italian, and Belgian representatives. On either side of that end of the horseshoe were seated the Brazilian delegates, and on the inside, from the end up to the centre, came the delegates from Cuba, Greece, Haiti, Peru, Portugal, Serbia, Czecho-Slovakia, and Uruguay. On the other side of the horseshoe, to the left of M. Poincar\u00e9, next to the British delegation, sat the delegates from Canada, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, and India; and lastly the Japanese representatives. On the inner side of the table facing them, starting from the bottom, sat the delegates from Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala, the King of the Hedjaz, Liberia, Panama, Poland, Rumania and Siam. Peace Conference opened First questions: punishment of the Kaiser 20 January 1919 The Inter-Allied peace conference was formally opened on Saturday afternoon at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Paris with a plenary meeting of all the 32 Allied and associated nations (including the British dominions and India) that have been allotted delegates. It was, in accordance with Friday\u2019s decision, an \u201copen\u201d meeting, held in the presence of journalists of many countries, who, however, could only see and hear with difficulty. The speech in which President Poincar\u00e9 declared the conference open set before it its task of creating a new order in the world on the unanimously accepted principles of President Wilson, including the establishment of a general League of Nations. M. Clemenceau, the French prime minister, was elected president of the conference. Proceeding at once to business, M. Clemenceau stated that the question ordered for the day were: 1) Responsibility for the war. 2) Penalties on crimes committed during the war. 3) International legislation in regard to labour. M. Clemenceau asked the delegates to begin by examining into the question of the responsibility of the authors of the war, which, he said, would be facilitated by a report to be sent them on the criminal responsibility of the ex-Kaiser. Both Frenchmen also referred to the reparation and guarantees of security needed, particularly by France. Read the full article. Editorial: The Conference of Paris 20 January 1919 As M. Poincar\u00e9 reminded the delegates, the conference at Paris opened 48 years to the day after the proclamation of the German Empire at Versailles. The coincidence was probably designed, one of those strokes in which the historical and the aesthetic sense of France delights. The coincidence is one well worth meditating upon. In 1914 the German Empire had every air of being as solidly founded a political fabric as any in the world. At its head stood a Royal house which enjoyed popular esteem. It was governed by a bureaucracy which was a byword for patience and for skill. Its army was the strongest in the world. Its people one of the most laborious races in Europe. Its commerce was flourishing and expanding all over the globe. All this magnificent structure has collapsed. The German Empire has had not one of the longest, but one of the shortest lives among the empires in the history. What is the reason? Here is a fine subject for the historian, and the moralist. Yet the central reason is plain. We can accept Bismarck\u2019s own teaching that the German Empire was made by blood and iron. It was fashioned by violence and by a wholly amoral ruthlessness. In the deliberate philosophy of the makers of the German Empire it was a monument to the virtue of pure force and pure calculation, and its success was the vindication of pure force and pure calculation as sovereign remedies in politics. Up to the very eve of the war the German Empire and German statecraft were quoted as convincing rebukes to democracy. The German people sold liberty for the success of German Imperialism. Bismarck undertook to destroy the liberal movement in Germany by demonstrating that Biskmarckian statesmanship was the way to glory. No doubt in his case force was tempered by prudence, and we may well believe that he would not have made the mistake of provoking universal distrust and enmity and launching Germany into a war with whole world. But just as it is in the nature of great men to be succeeded by small men, so it was in the nature of his philosophy that in the hands of small men it should lead Germany to this disaster. The essence of his gospel was force, and force intoxicated, except with those rare individuals who can coldly calculate the limits of bayonets. The fall of the German Empire is not in despite of Bismarck, but in consequence of Bismarck. It has collapsed because of his foundations. Two other great Empires \u2013 the Russian and the Austrian \u2013 passed out of history along with the German Empire. They were fit companions. So dulled is our imagination when actually living through great events that we fail to grasp their magnitude. We look upon the destruction of Austria and of Russia as inevitable, commonplace. Nevertheless, a few years ago what serious student would have foretold it? The search for morals in history requires much faith. We might conclude from the fall of three great Empires the old and not too comforting lesson of the mortality of human things. Even that would have its value if it served to tame the arrogance of political architects and to lend something of moderation and of tolerance, along with a dash of melancholy, to political speculation and political conflict. It is not without use to look at things from the standpoint of eternity. But in the tremendous events through which we are passing we may discover at least two other lessons of value to the world in the work of reconstruction upon which it is engaged. The first is that force and amorality are a rotten foundation for states. M. Poincar\u00e9 tells us that justice must rule the deliberations of the peace conference. It is fine saying, and the Allied statesmen must be true to it in spirit and in word. They are under every sort of temptation to be false to it. They are the heirs of a bad tradition \u2013 the tradition of secrecy, the tradition of power, the tradition of barter. Again, there is nobody to resist them. The whole world is spread before them; they have but to stretch out their hands and take. To fortify them in resisting these temptations they have the moral spectacle of the destruction of three empires which acted as though force were the highest law. If the passionate desire of the peoples of the world for peace and justice should fail to convert the Allied statesmen, there is the powerful argument of Germany, Austria, and Russia that the way of violence and rapacious appetite does not prosper. The second moral is that the fond belief that politics abhors the small state is erroneous. Whatever the ultimate aspect of Russia, Germany, and Austria-Hungary, it is certain that they will slough off many states. The peace conference will sanctify the birth or revival of a dozen new states in two continents. We need not enter into the rather sterile debate as to the rival merits of great states and little states. The world never was constituted entirely of the one or the other. The tide which for 50 years seemed to be running strongly towards the great state has definitely turned. The world of the future will see a balance between the great states and the little states. Both have their place in scheme of things. The Allied statesmen in conference would make a profound error if they thought the function of the small state was merely to adorn their triumphs or to be the instrument for their purposes. To create them in that spirit and with that object would be merely to establish the rule of force under a plausible mask. The old school of diplomacy, a school which is very far from dead, knew no other way of working, but if the peace conference were to follow it its work would lack stability and permanence. The small states and the small peoples must come into their rights for their own sakes. This is an edited extract. Read the full article. The treaty was signed on 28 June 1919 and took force on 10 January 1920.",

Yet, with so many much-loved traditional dishes, the recipe itself is a bubbling cauldron of controversy: hardline purists maintain that it should contain nothing but meat, onions, potatoes and water, while others proffer treasured family recipes thickened with pearl barley, or sweetened with root vegetables.</p> <p>Sadly, I can\u2019t remember my Dublin-born grandma ever making such a thing (possibly because my mum is the only Irish citizen ever to scorn the spud), so I can\u2019t offer my own version. On the bright side, this leaves me the freedom to be slightly more objective about what works and what doesn\u2019t. Having said that, on the downside, I\u2019ll probably have to go into hiding.

On that point, even I won\u2019t budge. Strictly speaking, it ought to be mutton or even kid goat, because, as historian Regina Sexton points out in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/oxford-companion-to-food.html\" title=\"\">The Oxford Companion to Food</a>, in days gone by, \u201cthe economic importance of sheep lay in their wool and milk produce, and thus ensured that only old or economically non-viable animals ended up in the cooking pot\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cc4bcee3adfc3b1dea180f9225fdb74d9bad44d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc4bcee3adfc3b1dea180f9225fdb74d9bad44d4/638_195_2670_2670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Darina Allen\u2019s recipe calls for lamb chops, but it\u2019s a shame to waste tender meat on a stew\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darina Allen\u2019s recipe calls for lamb chops, but it seems a shame to waste such tender meat on a stew.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But few modern recipes use it. That\u2019s a shame, because slow cooking like this is the best way to appreciate a meat that, for all its flavour, can tend towards the tough: I try breast of mutton suggested by <a href=\"http://www.ireland-guide.com/article/georgina-campbells-book-review.12127.html\" title=\"\">All in the Cooking</a>, the official textbook of Dublin\u2019s famous Col\u00e1iste Mhuire Cookery School first published in 1946 and widely used in domestic science classes until the 1970s. We all thoroughly enjoy it, though it must be said that breast is a very fatty cut that makes for an incredibly rich gravy.</p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum, <a href=\"https://ballymaloe.ie/recipe/ballymaloe-irish-stew\" title=\"\">Darina Allen\u2019s recipe in the Ballymaloe Cookery Course book</a>, named after the famous East Cork cookery school she founded in 1981, is prefaced with the advice that it\u2019s best made in early summer, \u201cwith young lamb\u201d, cut into chops not less than an inch thick. Making this in winter, I can\u2019t speak for spring lamb, except to say that I think the chops would probably be less fatty than the ones I use. But, delicious as the results are, it seems a shame to waste such tender meat on a stew.</p> <p>The same goes for Diana Henry\u2019s lamb shanks: they\u2019re incredibly good, but about twice the price of the lamb neck preferred by Irish television legend Monica Sheridan, \u201cMammy of Irish cookery\u201d <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/food-and-drink/the-extraordinary-life-of-the-mammy-of-irish-cookery-1.3284458\" title=\"\">Maura Laverty</a> and chef Richard Corrigan. Laverty calls for best end, and Corrigan for middle neck, both of which are rather meatier than the scrag end Allen reckons would have been traditional in old-style \u201cIrish cabins\u201d, which, of course, makes excellent stock.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5a6c26646e63d8cc6df15735927ec1d19b5faf4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a6c26646e63d8cc6df15735927ec1d19b5faf4f/382_0_3021_3021/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diana Henry\u2019s version uses expensive lamb shanks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diana Henry\u2019s version uses expensive lamb shanks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The important thing is to ensure you have enough meat to go round (though this isn\u2019t a particularly meat-heavy dish) and enough bones to give flavour, so I\u2019d suggest getting hold of a lamb neck and asking for it to be cut into chops, so you get the whole lot.</p> <p>If you don\u2019t happen to have a butcher handy, and don\u2019t have the time to order online, go for cubed lamb, as recommended by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/McMoop/status/1064880355654684672\" title=\"\">Mena Rogers</a>, a friend\u2019s mum from Co Roscommon, who was taught by her own mother, Anne Gilhooly, who wowed everyone with her cooking just before the war. <a href=\"https://www.irishcentral.com/news/irishvoice/clodagh-mckennas-irish-lamb-stew-with-pearl-barley-recipe\" title=\"\">Clodagh McKenna similarly recommends stewing lamb</a>, which generally comes from the neck, shoulder, breast or even shank, though using boneless meat will mean you need to find some decent stock.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8d4a64e5d16e887630a3112c629ce3c613c88d9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d4a64e5d16e887630a3112c629ce3c613c88d9c/516_55_2959_2959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Corrigan\u2019s lamb shanks are twice the price\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Corrigan also uses lamb shanks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Potatoes</h2> <p>As <a href=\"http://eatlikeagirl.com/how-to-cook-a-proper-irish-stew-as-irish-people-do/\" title=\"\">food writer Niamh Shields puts it</a>: \u201cIrish stew without potatoes is not Irish stew \u2013 this is non-negotiable.\u201d What sort of potatoes, however, is somewhat less straightforward. Most older recipes just call for potatoes without further detail, but more modern versions are usually more discriminating, with Allen, Henry and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall calling for floury or even \u201cvery floury\u201d varieties.</p> <p>The distinction is important, because, in England at least, we don\u2019t really do floury in the same way as they do across the water: here, <a href=\"http://balaganrecipes.info/potato-varieties/\" title=\"\">the most widely available floury potatoes are roosters</a> (22% \u201cdry matter\u201d \u2013 for that is the enticing way the consistency of potatoes is measured), followed by maris pipers (21.8%), desirees (20.8%) and king edwards (20.5%). This, of course, varies widely by size and season, but none of them can touch the imported golden wonders I find at an Irish butcher up the road, also, apparently, known as \u201cgreat balls of flour\u201d. These, Allen\u2019s kerr\u2019s pink and Shields\u2019 queen\u2019s potatoes are far fluffier than any of the above, so if you can find them, go for them, because the flourier the potato, the better it will be at thickening the stew. As Henry observes, the potatoes should be simmered long enough to break down into the liquid \u2013 indeed, if you slice them as thinly as All in the Cooking recommends, they\u2019ll break down almost completely into a thick, gluey sauce, rich with fat: utterly delicious, but almost more mash than stew.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0dea7b2e0233a18ac3fa14ce93f260022b604135\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dea7b2e0233a18ac3fa14ce93f260022b604135/504_0_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mena Rogers\u2019 version uses cubes of lamb.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Irish home cook Mena Rogers prefers cubed lamb, and waxy potatoes instead of floury ones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One solution is to add them in stages. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Corkwomanabu/status/1064852109101694978\" title=\"\">Deidre tweets me from Cork</a>: \u201cA few potatoes should be chopped so they fall asunder in the stew and act as a natural thickening agent. The others are added for the last 15-20 minutes or so.\u201d Corrigan even uses two types of spud: one floury to melt into the stew, one waxy to stay intact. Personally, I prefer the fluffiness of the floury kind for gravy-soaking purposes, so I\u2019m going to start the stew with a layer of sliced potatoes and add some whole ones for the final half-hour, though if you\u2019re not a floury potato fan, you may wish to go down his route instead.</p> <h2>The other veg</h2> <p>Onions are the only other must-have. All in the Cooking\u2019s Irish stew, which generations of young cooks would have started with, contains only four ingredients \u2013 meat, potatoes, onions and water, plus a parsley garnish \u2013 and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KeepCalmFannyOn/status/1064871388866064385\" title=\"\">Sheridan\u2019s is the same</a>, though with thyme instead of the parsley. They\u2019re surprisingly good for something so very plain: it turns out that, for all of our fancy tastes, meat and tatties can still make us happy on a cold, grey day.</p> <p>Carrots are the most popular extra, though I find little evidence that these are more of a southern thing, as <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017275-irish-stew\" title=\"\">David Tanis claims in the New York Times</a>. Sheridan allows that they may be served on the side, but insists that \u201cit is quite wrong to cook carrots with this stew, as the long cooking will leave them insipid\u201d. Testers enjoy their sweetness, but I\u2019m inclined to agree that they do become mushy in the time it takes to cook the meat properly, so, like Henry, I\u2019m going to add them at a later stage.</p> <p>Celery is next up, used by Rogers and Laverty. I\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t much care for celery in any form, so I don\u2019t feel bad about leaving that out. I do very much like the cornucopia of other veg in Rogers\u2019 stew, though: turnip (which here, apparently, means the orange thing I\u2019d call a swede), leek and a little bit of cabbage, \u201cjust for colour\u201d, all in a delicious, meaty broth. It really is a complete meal in a bowl, though far be it from me to urge you into such heresies. (Try it though, it\u2019s lovely.)</p> <p>Allen suggests using tiny baby carrots and onions in her spring recipe, which is a nice idea if you want this dish to look a little more elegant (in which case you might want to use little salad potatoes as well).</p> <h2>The liquid and flavourings</h2> <p>Herbs and spices tend, unsurprisingly, to be kept fairly simple: bay, parsley and thyme are popular, with chives and parsley the most common toppings. Gary Rhodes and Rachel Allen both add garlic, but this seems to me a dangerously fancy road to go down. If onions are good enough for the domestic science syllabus, they\u2019re good enough for me.</p> <p>The same goes for wine or stout: some modern recipes moisten the stew with stock, but this should be necessary only if you\u2019re using boneless stewing meat: good-quality lamb stock is hard to get here, so I use chicken instead in the Ballymaloe recipe, and it works out very well. If not, then let\u2019s be honest, a cube isn\u2019t going to bring the sky down on your head.</p> <p>Even better, however, is to make a stock from the stew meat itself. Corrigan takes it off the bone and uses the bones to make a stock, while Henry slow-cooks shanks in water and aromatics until tender, then strains the resulting broth to cook the vegetables in. Both excellent recipes, but if you\u2019ve managed to get hold of lamb neck on the bone, it\u2019s easier to cook as is and pull off the meat off the bone before serving (or let people do it themselves on their plates): the gravy will still be rich and full-flavoured, and it\u2019s far less faff.</p> <p>That said, all beasts are different, and if you taste the gravy and decide it\u2019s still underpowered, Rogers\u2019 dash of Worcestershire sauce, or indeed the Oxo cube apparently favoured by many Irish grannies, are your rescue remedies. And if you\u2019re feeling really daring, then chef Michael Clifford of the legendary Clonmel restaurant Clifford\u2019s used to <a href=\"http://www.ireland-guide.com/article/cooking-for-ireland---cliffords-gourmet-irish-stew---fresh-mackerel-with-oatmeal-in-nut-brown-butter-and-lemon---watercress.5298.html\" title=\"\">add a good glug of double cream to his stew</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/irish-stew-f7h2gr89l9f\" title=\"\">Lindsey Bareham recommends a knob of butter</a>. Just don\u2019t say I told you to do it.</p> <h2>The method</h2> <p>Traditionally, it seems, the ingredients would have been put in the pot raw, as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Caccabus/status/1064650816676601861\" title=\"\">Laverty</a>, <a href=\"http://www.recipesource.com/soups/stews/03/rec0303.html\" title=\"\">Theodora FitzGibbon</a> and All in the Cooking\u2019s recipes dictate, but more recent versions, such as the Ballymaloe one, brown the meat and veg first, with Allen and Shields both rendering fat from the meat for the purpose. Neck doesn\u2019t tend to come with great lumps of fat, but I do think it\u2019s worth softening the onions if you have time; raw onion is a remarkably persistent flavour, even after two hours in the oven, so it\u2019s 15 minutes well spent. The rest, however, can go in raw: this is a dish of soothingly mild flavours, patiently extracted over a low heat; traditionally over the fire, of course. But, as with any slow-cooked dishes, it\u2019s easier to keep the temperature constant in a medium oven \u2013 and as Allen so perspicaciously observes, \u201ca stew boiled is a stew spoiled\u201d.</p> <p>One thing that is worth spending time on, however, is skimming the fat from the gravy, as Allen also recommends (though you don\u2019t need to thicken the gravy with a roux afterwards, unless your potatoes have failed in their thickening duties). As Rogers and Shields point out, Irish stew tastes even better the next day, so the easiest way to degrease is to drain the stew, then chill it and the liquid separately, so the fat solidifies on top of the gravy.</p> <h2>Perfect Irish stew</h2> <p>Prep <strong>20 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>2 hr</strong><br>Serves <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>2 tbsp oil or lamb fat</strong><br><strong>3 large onions</strong>, peeled and thickly sliced<br><strong>10-12 medium very floury potatoes</strong>, depending on size and hunger, golden wonder or kerr\u2019s pink are ideal, if you can get them; otherwise rooster, desiree or maris piper<br><strong>1 neck of lamb, hogget or mutton</strong>, cut into thick slices<br><strong>2 sprigs fresh thyme</strong><br><strong>6 carrots</strong> (optional; substitute some of these for chopped turnip, swede or leek, if you like)<br><strong>Chopped parsley or chives</strong>, to serve</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2149f073d82f9c5bcac802235bf8a7b956ee1e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2149f073d82f9c5bcac802235bf8a7b956ee1e5/0_426_8216_5455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frying onions\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sweat the sliced onions over a medium flame until softened, then remove and set aside.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Matthews/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4.

      "bodyText": "Winter pleasures don\u2019t get much simpler than a steaming pot of Irish stew: cheap, easy and gloriously warming, they\u2019re the culinary equivalent of a big woolly scarf. Yet, with so many much-loved traditional dishes, the recipe itself is a bubbling cauldron of controversy: hardline purists maintain that it should contain nothing but meat, onions, potatoes and water, while others proffer treasured family recipes thickened with pearl barley, or sweetened with root vegetables. Sadly, I can\u2019t remember my Dublin-born grandma ever making such a thing (possibly because my mum is the only Irish citizen ever to scorn the spud), so I can\u2019t offer my own version. On the bright side, this leaves me the freedom to be slightly more objective about what works and what doesn\u2019t. Having said that, on the downside, I\u2019ll probably have to go into hiding. Here goes \u2026 The meat Though you\u2019ll find many recipes online calling for beef, especially by American writers (lamb being so puzzling unpopular in the US that, as recently as 2011, more than half the population had never even tasted the stuff), Irish stew is made with sheep meat. On that point, even I won\u2019t budge. Strictly speaking, it ought to be mutton or even kid goat, because, as historian Regina Sexton points out in The Oxford Companion to Food, in days gone by, \u201cthe economic importance of sheep lay in their wool and milk produce, and thus ensured that only old or economically non-viable animals ended up in the cooking pot\u201d. But few modern recipes use it. That\u2019s a shame, because slow cooking like this is the best way to appreciate a meat that, for all its flavour, can tend towards the tough: I try breast of mutton suggested by All in the Cooking, the official textbook of Dublin\u2019s famous Col\u00e1iste Mhuire Cookery School first published in 1946 and widely used in domestic science classes until the 1970s. We all thoroughly enjoy it, though it must be said that breast is a very fatty cut that makes for an incredibly rich gravy. At the other end of the spectrum, Darina Allen\u2019s recipe in the Ballymaloe Cookery Course book, named after the famous East Cork cookery school she founded in 1981, is prefaced with the advice that it\u2019s best made in early summer, \u201cwith young lamb\u201d, cut into chops not less than an inch thick. Making this in winter, I can\u2019t speak for spring lamb, except to say that I think the chops would probably be less fatty than the ones I use. But, delicious as the results are, it seems a shame to waste such tender meat on a stew. The same goes for Diana Henry\u2019s lamb shanks: they\u2019re incredibly good, but about twice the price of the lamb neck preferred by Irish television legend Monica Sheridan, \u201cMammy of Irish cookery\u201d Maura Laverty and chef Richard Corrigan. Laverty calls for best end, and Corrigan for middle neck, both of which are rather meatier than the scrag end Allen reckons would have been traditional in old-style \u201cIrish cabins\u201d, which, of course, makes excellent stock. The important thing is to ensure you have enough meat to go round (though this isn\u2019t a particularly meat-heavy dish) and enough bones to give flavour, so I\u2019d suggest getting hold of a lamb neck and asking for it to be cut into chops, so you get the whole lot. If you don\u2019t happen to have a butcher handy, and don\u2019t have the time to order online, go for cubed lamb, as recommended by Mena Rogers, a friend\u2019s mum from Co Roscommon, who was taught by her own mother, Anne Gilhooly, who wowed everyone with her cooking just before the war. Clodagh McKenna similarly recommends stewing lamb, which generally comes from the neck, shoulder, breast or even shank, though using boneless meat will mean you need to find some decent stock. Potatoes As food writer Niamh Shields puts it: \u201cIrish stew without potatoes is not Irish stew \u2013 this is non-negotiable.\u201d What sort of potatoes, however, is somewhat less straightforward. Most older recipes just call for potatoes without further detail, but more modern versions are usually more discriminating, with Allen, Henry and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall calling for floury or even \u201cvery floury\u201d varieties. The distinction is important, because, in England at least, we don\u2019t really do floury in the same way as they do across the water: here, the most widely available floury potatoes are roosters (22% \u201cdry matter\u201d \u2013 for that is the enticing way the consistency of potatoes is measured), followed by maris pipers (21.8%), desirees (20.8%) and king edwards (20.5%). This, of course, varies widely by size and season, but none of them can touch the imported golden wonders I find at an Irish butcher up the road, also, apparently, known as \u201cgreat balls of flour\u201d. These, Allen\u2019s kerr\u2019s pink and Shields\u2019 queen\u2019s potatoes are far fluffier than any of the above, so if you can find them, go for them, because the flourier the potato, the better it will be at thickening the stew. As Henry observes, the potatoes should be simmered long enough to break down into the liquid \u2013 indeed, if you slice them as thinly as All in the Cooking recommends, they\u2019ll break down almost completely into a thick, gluey sauce, rich with fat: utterly delicious, but almost more mash than stew. One solution is to add them in stages. Deidre tweets me from Cork: \u201cA few potatoes should be chopped so they fall asunder in the stew and act as a natural thickening agent. The others are added for the last 15-20 minutes or so.\u201d Corrigan even uses two types of spud: one floury to melt into the stew, one waxy to stay intact. Personally, I prefer the fluffiness of the floury kind for gravy-soaking purposes, so I\u2019m going to start the stew with a layer of sliced potatoes and add some whole ones for the final half-hour, though if you\u2019re not a floury potato fan, you may wish to go down his route instead. The other veg Onions are the only other must-have. All in the Cooking\u2019s Irish stew, which generations of young cooks would have started with, contains only four ingredients \u2013 meat, potatoes, onions and water, plus a parsley garnish \u2013 and Sheridan\u2019s is the same, though with thyme instead of the parsley. They\u2019re surprisingly good for something so very plain: it turns out that, for all of our fancy tastes, meat and tatties can still make us happy on a cold, grey day. Carrots are the most popular extra, though I find little evidence that these are more of a southern thing, as David Tanis claims in the New York Times. Sheridan allows that they may be served on the side, but insists that \u201cit is quite wrong to cook carrots with this stew, as the long cooking will leave them insipid\u201d. Testers enjoy their sweetness, but I\u2019m inclined to agree that they do become mushy in the time it takes to cook the meat properly, so, like Henry, I\u2019m going to add them at a later stage. Celery is next up, used by Rogers and Laverty. I\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t much care for celery in any form, so I don\u2019t feel bad about leaving that out. I do very much like the cornucopia of other veg in Rogers\u2019 stew, though: turnip (which here, apparently, means the orange thing I\u2019d call a swede), leek and a little bit of cabbage, \u201cjust for colour\u201d, all in a delicious, meaty broth. It really is a complete meal in a bowl, though far be it from me to urge you into such heresies. (Try it though, it\u2019s lovely.)

If not, then let\u2019s be honest, a cube isn\u2019t going to bring the sky down on your head. Even better, however, is to make a stock from the stew meat itself. Corrigan takes it off the bone and uses the bones to make a stock, while Henry slow-cooks shanks in water and aromatics until tender, then strains the resulting broth to cook the vegetables in. Both excellent recipes, but if you\u2019ve managed to get hold of lamb neck on the bone, it\u2019s easier to cook as is and pull off the meat off the bone before serving (or let people do it themselves on their plates): the gravy will still be rich and full-flavoured, and it\u2019s far less faff. That said, all beasts are different, and if you taste the gravy and decide it\u2019s still underpowered, Rogers\u2019 dash of Worcestershire sauce, or indeed the Oxo cube apparently favoured by many Irish grannies, are your rescue remedies. And if you\u2019re feeling really daring, then chef Michael Clifford of the legendary Clonmel restaurant Clifford\u2019s used to add a good glug of double cream to his stew, while Lindsey Bareham recommends a knob of butter. Just don\u2019t say I told you to do it. The method Traditionally, it seems, the ingredients would have been put in the pot raw, as Laverty, Theodora FitzGibbon and All in the Cooking\u2019s recipes dictate, but more recent versions, such as the Ballymaloe one, brown the meat and veg first, with Allen and Shields both rendering fat from the meat for the purpose.

Perfect Irish stew Prep 20 min Cook 2 hr Serves 6 2 tbsp oil or lamb fat 3 large onions, peeled and thickly sliced 10-12 medium very floury potatoes, depending on size and hunger, golden wonder or kerr\u2019s pink are ideal, if you can get them; otherwise rooster, desiree or maris piper 1 neck of lamb, hogget or mutton, cut into thick slices 2 sprigs fresh thyme 6 carrots (optional; substitute some of these for chopped turnip, swede or leek, if you like) Chopped parsley or chives, to serve Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4.

      "body": "<p>Some people seem to have terrible childhoods and yet manage to thrive despite them. Others grow up in loving homes but suffer from mental and physical health difficulties, even if their siblings do not. Why? </p> <p>Research shows that about 15 to 20 % of children experience well over half of the recorded psychological illnesses. The remaining 75 to 80 % are comparatively healthy.

It\u2019s true, children from poorer backgrounds suffer slightly more illnesses and show more signs of psychological disturbance, but socioeconomic factors by no means account for all children who are in that fifth of the population who suffer half the illnesses. Whether a child blossoms or falters is driven wholly neither by environment nor by genetics, but by the interplay between the two. In this book, paediatric health expert W Thomas Boyce identifies two personality types. He argues that four fifths of children appear to be \u201cdandelions\u201d, who can thrive in most environments. The remaining fifth are \u201corchids\u201d, who are more exquisite and unusual and have a higher potential than dandelions \u2013 but for this to be realised they require a particular environment and careful gardening.

They tend to be sensitive, shy, have negative emotional reactions to novel or changing conditions, and perhaps display challenging behaviour. But these symptoms cannot be taken as proof that a child will necessarily respond in a certain way to tests and show a high stress biological reaction to an external stressor.

Although the experiment is scripted, and the researchers who test the children are all warm towards their subjects, how much cortisol (a stress hormone) and how much their autonomic nervous system (flight-or-fight response) is stimulated varies enormously, though in a predictable way. Time and time again, about four fifths of subjects show low levels of biological stress in these tests, and a fifth exhibit significantly higher stress levels.

But if their environment works against them, they sink to the bottom, below the more robust dandelions who are less affected by their environment.

Others grow up in loving homes but suffer from mental and physical health difficulties, even if their siblings do not. Why? Research shows that about 15 to 20 % of children experience well over half of the recorded psychological illnesses. The remaining 75 to 80 % are comparatively healthy. This pattern continues into adulthood, and appears to be true for children around the world. The first variable you would expect to account for these differences is whether the child comes from a prosperous or a poor background.

      "bodyText": "One of the few comforts available to Brexit Britain is the thought that, no matter how dysfunctional we\u2019ve become, at least we\u2019re not Trump\u2019s America. We may be crazy, reduced to organising fake traffic jams in a Kent airport, but at least we\u2019re not in the third week of a government shutdown, caused by an unhinged president stamping his foot \u2013 and speaking of a \u201ccrisis of the soul\u201d in a national TV address \u2013 just because his opponents refuse to fork out $5bn for a border wall to keep out migrants. It\u2019s a consolation of sorts and, lord knows, we need all the comfort we can get. But I\u2019m not sure our smugness on this score is justified. Isn\u2019t it possible that the absurdity unfolding in the US is simply a more garish, cartoonish version of what\u2019s happening here? Start with the notion of a shutdown. True, the UK government has not formally ceased operating in the way that one quarter of the federal bureaucracy has closed in the US: offices are still open, public employees are still getting paid. But few would claim that the British government is functioning normally. Witness the Bloomberg report that, under the headline \u201cBrexit has Brought Britain to a Standstill,\u201d declared starkly, \u201cThe UK \u2013 as an administrative entity \u2013 has virtually stopped working.\u201d The leaders of local authorities and big companies make the same complaint: that they cannot get decisions out of a Whitehall paralysed by Brexit.

It has also been backed by Labour MPs including Stephen Doughty and Chris Leslie.The government believed such a business motion should be amendable only by a minister, and was expected to fiercely resist Bercow\u2019s decision to accept the Grieve amendment.</p> <p>Adding to the government\u2019s likely concerns, a previous amendment by Grieve, voted through by the Commons before Christmas, means any statement that follows a defeat is in itself amendable \u2013 allowing MPs to put forward their own alternatives for the future of the Brexit process.</p> <p>So if May came back with an alternative plan, that could be amended by MPs, giving parliament far more scope in setting the direction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/09/brexit-economy-broken-leaders-gdp-growth-labour\">Brexit proved our economy is broken, but our leaders still have no clue how to fix it | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative chair of the health select committee, who also signed the amendment, said the aim was to prevent the government \u201crunning down the clock\u201d towards no deal.

      "bodyText": "The Speaker, John Bercow, has allowed MPs to debate an amendment that could force Theresa May to present a new Brexit plan within three days if her current proposal is voted down, a decision likely to enrage the government. Bercow has selected an amendment led by the Conservative MP Dominic Grieve to the business motion that sets up the latest five-day debate on the prime minister\u2019s plan, which will culminate in a crunch vote next Tuesday. The news comes as Labour edged closer to promising a near-immediate vote of no-confidence in the government if May loses the vote. The amendment says that following defeat of the government\u2019s plan, which is widely anticipated, \u201ca minister of the crown shall table within three sitting days a motion \u2026 considering the process of exiting the European Union under article 50\u201d. Grieve said he understood his amendment had been accepted. \u201cI believe it has,\u201d he said, adding that it was \u201ceminently sensible\u201d. He said: \u201cThis solidifies and emphasises the key role of parliament.\u201d Other MPs who have signed the amendment include the former Tory cabinet minister Sir Oliver Letwin and ex-Tory ministers Jo Johnson, Guto Bebb and Sam Gyimah. It has also been backed by Labour MPs including Stephen Doughty and Chris Leslie.The government believed such a business motion should be amendable only by a minister, and was expected to fiercely resist Bercow\u2019s decision to accept the Grieve amendment. Adding to the government\u2019s likely concerns, a previous amendment by Grieve, voted through by the Commons before Christmas, means any statement that follows a defeat is in itself amendable \u2013 allowing MPs to put forward their own alternatives for the future of the Brexit process. So if May came back with an alternative plan, that could be amended by MPs, giving parliament far more scope in setting the direction. Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative chair of the health select committee, who also signed the amendment, said the aim was to prevent the government \u201crunning down the clock\u201d towards no deal. Previously, the Commons had mandated the government to make a statement within 21 days. \u201cIf and when the PM\u2019s plan is voted down on Tuesday, MPs can\u2019t be made to wait potentially until 12 February for the next vote. The situation is too urgent now,\u201d Leslie said. Also on Wednesday, two Labour frontbenchers indicated their party could soon push for a formal no-confidence motion in May\u2019s government, which could trigger a general election if it was won. Discussing the likely defeat of the Brexit plan next week, Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cObviously, the next thing to do immediately after that is for there to be a vote of confidence in the government.\u201d Speaking later on Sky News, Andrew Gwynne, the shadow communities secretary, confirmed the plan. Asked if this meant a confidence vote would come \u201cnext week, basically\u201d if May lost the vote. Gwynne replied: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d It comes a day after the government suffered a significant defeat on the finance bill, in which a powerful cross-party group of MPs led by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper passed an amendment limiting the government\u2019s tax administration powers in the event of the UK leaving the EU with no deal, unless this was explicitly endorsed by MPs. Those behind the amendment\u2019s success conceded it might have little material effect on no-deal preparations. Instead, its purpose had been to galvanise MPs across the House of Commons and proves there was a parliamentary majority to oppose no deal. The rebels said they could seek to amend any and every piece of legislation the government brings to parliament between now and March. The prime minister is still seeking a form of legally binding reassurance from the European Union about the temporary nature of the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, the main bone of contention that has led Tory MPs to reject her deal. David Lidington, May\u2019s de facto deputy, said on Wednesday MPs should not expect Brussels to unpick the withdrawal agreement. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the British public are served by fantasies about magical alternative deals that are somehow going to sort of spring out of a cupboard in Brussels,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Top story: Oval Office speech condemned by Democrats Despite his recent threats, Donald Trump did not use his first live Oval Office address to declare a national emergency over immigration, nor did he offer any further solution to the ongoing government shutdown. Instead, the president filled the broadcast with familiar and dubious claims about border security and illegal immigration in an attempt to drum up public support for his coveted border wall. Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer condemned the president\u2019s speech in their televised response, with Pelosi accusing him of holding the country \u201chostage\u201d. Who pays? Among the claims in Trump\u2019s speech was his insistence that the border wall would be paid for \u201cindirectly\u201d by Mexico via the new USMCA trade deal, an assertion roundly dismissed by fact-checkers. Government closures start to bite for farmers and flyers As the partial government shutdown nears the end of its third week, the effects are beginning to be felt across various areas of American life. Farmers awaiting emergency federal aid during the US-China trade war face further uncertainty thanks to the closure of the US agriculture department. A lack of safety inspectors and security officers has led to long lines and diminished safety at airports. And the furloughing of some 13,000 EPA workers is putting Americans\u2019 health at risk as potentially polluted air and water goes untested. Joshua Tree. Officials have closed Joshua Tree national park in California after a spate of vandalism and other problems, following 18 days in which the park was kept open by volunteers during the shutdown. Mueller: Manafort shared internal polling data with Russian Robert Mueller believes Paul Manafort, when he was Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign manager, shared internal polling data on the 2016 election with the Russian consultant Konstantin Kilimnik, who is thought to have ties to Moscow\u2019s intelligence agencies.

In the document, Manafort\u2019s lawyers say any false statements he made to Mueller\u2019s investigation were memory lapses, not lies. Mystery firm. The supreme court has rejected a request from an unidentified foreign company to waive a daily $50,000 fine for defying a subpoena from Mueller\u2019s special counsel investigation. Trump Tower meeting. Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who attended a now-infamous June 2016 meeting with Trump aides at Trump Tower in New York, has been charged by federal prosecutors with obstruction of justice. Markets up amid hopes of a US-China trade ceasefire The US and China have concluded their trade talks in Beijing after negotiations were extended to a third day, raising hopes of an entente between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Markets were up on Wednesday as Bloomberg reported that Trump is desperate to reach a deal with China to bolster a flagging stock market. Ted McKinney, the US undersecretary of agriculture for trade and foreign agricultural affairs, who is part of the US delegation, told reporters in Beijing that the discussions had gone \u201cjust fine\u201d. Possible breakthrough. It is thought the negotiators made progress on issues including increased access to China\u2019s markets. Potential obstacles. But the two nations reportedly remain divided on Trump administration demands over Chinese structural reforms to prevent the alleged theft of US technology.

Must-reads Kehinde Wiley: why Black Lives Matter on museum walls The painter Kehinde Wiley is best known for his portrait of Barack Obama. His most recent paintings are of African American locals in St Louis, in the style of Old Masters aristocrats. He tells Nadja Sayej the works are \u201ca response to the museum \u2026 as a strange metaphorical divide between the culture\u201d. How Tehran is like \u2018LA with minarets\u2019 With its concrete sprawl and its unending traffic congestion, Iran\u2019s capital bears an unlikely resemblance to southern California.

Amy Fleming asks what can be done to diminish the pull of all these irrepressible cravings. Opinion In his Oval Office address on Tuesday, Trump said women and children at the border were being used as \u201chuman pawns\u201d. He\u2019s partly right, says Richard Wolffe: they\u2019re being used as pawns by the president himself, to stoke irrational fear among Americans. This is a very real crisis inside one man\u2019s cranium and it\u2019s playing out in the living rooms of a weary nation. That crisis is called reality.

Growing up in the Burgundy countryside, she met Henry Gauthier-Villars AKA Willy, a controversial author and socialite who was an acquaintance of her father\u2019s. He was 14 years her senior; they married in 1893. As the film tells it, Colette used fashion as a way to express her transformation from a country girl in frills and long plaits to Parisian It-girl with a bob and a trouser suit (sidenote: Knightley\u2019s leg of mutton blouses and cropped boleros could also work in 2019).</p> <p>Andrea Flesch, the film\u2019s costume designer, says Colette\u2019s style reflected not only her journey, but also the shifts in society at the turn of the century.</p> <p>\u201cThis period changed quite often; the shapes changed every two or three years,\u201d says Flesch. \u201cIt was a very interesting time in fashion, the 1890s-1910s.\u201d Colette, however, had her own style. \u201cShe was as free [with clothes] as she was in everything.\u201dThis was the era when Colette was busy writing down the memories of her school days as the Claudine novels. While these were credited as being by Willy, they were bestsellers \u2013 spawning everything from Claudine-branded soap to dolls of the character and a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-u5WLJ9Yk4\" title=\"\">a proto-Britney Spears</a> fashion for grown-up women to wear the black-and-white schoolgirl uniforms of the era. Colette wrote the words but Willy saw the commercial opportunities. \u201cHe was a huge marketing man, really amazing,\u201d says Flesch. \u201cIt seems so modern for such a long time ago.\u201d</p> <p>The author herself was no slouch when it came to branding, either. Born Sidonie-Gabrielle, she became known by only her surname while she was still at school, recognising way before Madonna that a single moniker announces your importance from the get-go. After she separated from Willy, who famously plagiarised his wife, in 1906, this approach helped her as she became a giant of French literature.</p> <p>Those taking style inspiration from novelists such as Colette reflect a wider, more highbrow trend in fashion: US novelist Joan Didion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fashion-blog/2015/jan/06/joan-didion-celine-spring-2015\" title=\"\">featured in a Celine campaign in 2015</a>; French New Wave director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/21/agnes-varda-i-am-still-alive-i-am-still-curious-i-am-not-a-piece-of-rotting-flesh\" title=\"\">Agn\u00e8s Varda</a> is the <a href=\"https://thegentlewoman.co.uk/magazine\" title=\"\">cover star of The Gentlewoman</a> autumn edition, while <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/georgia-okeeffes-powerful-personal-style\" title=\"\">painter Georgia O\u2019Keefe\u2019s personal style</a> was featured in the New Yorker last year.</p> <p>Terry Newman, in the coffee table book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Legendary-Authors-Clothes-They-Wore/dp/0062428306\" title=\"\">Legendary Authors and the Clothes They Wore</a>, describes how Colette used clothes to \u201cradiate character, both in her own life and in the lives of the characters she created in her writing\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a4de628d44c1a5a4dee1c4a9d92ce3e8d29e644\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a4de628d44c1a5a4dee1c4a9d92ce3e8d29e644/0_328_3570_2142/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colette at home in Paris, circa 1940.

And Colette discovered Givenchy muse Audrey Hepburn, casting the almost-unknown actor in the stage version of her novel Gigi in 1951.</p> <p>Always in the avant garde, Colette was also a pioneer in her acceptance of androgyny and sexuality that was, then, taboo: the film shows the author\u2019s relationship with aristocrat Mathilde de Morny, or Missy, who was gay and wore men\u2019s clothes.</p> <p>Flesch says Missy changed Colette\u2019s style \u2013 a moment dramatised in the biopic when Knightley wears a pair of cycling culottes to stroll around a Parisian park. \u201cWearing trousers was a statement from Missy,\u201d says Flesch. \u201cShe was scandalous, and she was accepted because she was a noblewoman and rich. Colette wanted to show she was on the same level. She wanted to shock as well.\u201d</p> <p>Style isn\u2019t a footnote of Colette\u2019s legacy, it\u2019s a central part of it. Sixty-five years after her death, her influence extends beyond your bookshelf, Instagram captions and cinema: Colette\u2019s free spirit is inspiring our wardrobes, too.</p> <p><em>Colette is released in the UK this week </em></p>",

Colette wrote the words but Willy saw the commercial opportunities. \u201cHe was a huge marketing man, really amazing,\u201d says Flesch. \u201cIt seems so modern for such a long time ago.\u201d The author herself was no slouch when it came to branding, either. Born Sidonie-Gabrielle, she became known by only her surname while she was still at school, recognising way before Madonna that a single moniker announces your importance from the get-go. After she separated from Willy, who famously plagiarised his wife, in 1906, this approach helped her as she became a giant of French literature. Those taking style inspiration from novelists such as Colette reflect a wider, more highbrow trend in fashion: US novelist Joan Didion featured in a Celine campaign in 2015; French New Wave director Agn\u00e8s Varda is the cover star of The Gentlewoman autumn edition, while painter Georgia O\u2019Keefe\u2019s personal style was featured in the New Yorker last year. Terry Newman, in the coffee table book Legendary Authors and the Clothes They Wore, describes how Colette used clothes to \u201cradiate character, both in her own life and in the lives of the characters she created in her writing\u201d. That influence has endured in some surprising ways, from retail to Hollywood: she lent her name to Colette, the cult Parisian boutique that became an industry favourite before closing after 20 years in 2017. And Colette discovered Givenchy muse Audrey Hepburn, casting the almost-unknown actor in the stage version of her novel Gigi in 1951. Always in the avant garde, Colette was also a pioneer in her acceptance of androgyny and sexuality that was, then, taboo: the film shows the author\u2019s relationship with aristocrat Mathilde de Morny, or Missy, who was gay and wore men\u2019s clothes. Flesch says Missy changed Colette\u2019s style \u2013 a moment dramatised in the biopic when Knightley wears a pair of cycling culottes to stroll around a Parisian park. \u201cWearing trousers was a statement from Missy,\u201d says Flesch. \u201cShe was scandalous, and she was accepted because she was a noblewoman and rich. Colette wanted to show she was on the same level. She wanted to shock as well.\u201d Style isn\u2019t a footnote of Colette\u2019s legacy, it\u2019s a central part of it. Sixty-five years after her death, her influence extends beyond your bookshelf, Instagram captions and cinema: Colette\u2019s free spirit is inspiring our wardrobes, too. Colette is released in the UK this week",

The northern California-based rancher used to take her cattle to graze each summer in Oregon, but in 2014, OR-7, a solitary wolf dubbed Journey, found a mate and produced a litter of pups in the vicinity of Owens\u2019 herd. The Rogue pack was the first in the area in generations. \u201cAll of a sudden it\u2019s, \u2018Oh, he set up camp. And there\u2019s a female. And there\u2019s pups \u2013 oh my gosh!\u2019\u201d she recalled. Four years later, Owens again finds herself in wolf country. Another pack has settled in the northern California mountains where she and other ranchers graze sheep and cattle. It\u2019s news that has environmentalists celebrating \u2013 wolves were extirpated from the state in the 1920s \u2013 and ranchers wringing their hands amid a handful of livestock killings. But Owens is taking a remarkably contrarian tack: rather than calling for the removal of wolves, she\u2019s working to ensure safe coexistence with the canines. Top: Breanna Owens tends to her horses on her ranch in Los Molinos, California. Below left: Owens cares for the livestock on her ranch. Below right: Ranchers like Owens have to protect the animals on their ranches. Gray wolves were long seen as livestock-killing vermin and were driven nearly to extinction by the early 1900s.

She formed the Working Circle Proactive Stewardship, and Owens eventually signed on as its director. It suggests a suite of non-lethal wolf deterrents, including fladry (small red flags) and flashing lights, which can startle predators, and guard dogs. It teaches tactics such as bunching cattle together and rotating them around grazing areas, which not only keeps wolves at bay, it also better allows grass to regenerate. And it trains and funds range stewards, who spend time in the field with cattle, observing how best to manage the herd and protect it from predators. The question could not be more pressing: the new California pack, the Lassen pack, now consists of at least two adults, two yearlings and five pups, and has killed at least four calves since July. Todd Swickard suffered one such depredation. On 19 September, one of his ranch hands found a partially consumed calf, which state biologists confirmed was killed by a wolf.

In a parliamentary answer this week to a question asking if the government would cover the fee for civil service workers, the Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden said they would have to pay for themselves \u2013 and admitted that the government had no firm idea how many EU citizens it employed. Some employers have decided to pay the fee \u2013 including the Scottish government and London\u2019s Islington council in the public sector \u2013 but ministers have declined to do so, arguing that it is \u201cset at an affordable rate\u201d. The decision has prompted a complaint from the civil service union Prospect, whose deputy general secretary, Garry Graham, said: \u201cIt is unbelievable that the same government that has just spent over \u00a350,000 creating a fake traffic jam in Kent continues to believe that paying \u00a365 to permanently secure the future of their own staff is not a good use of money.\u201d Responding to a question from the Labour backbencher Alison McGovern, Dowden said: \u201cThe number of non-UK EU citizens employed across the civil service is not consistently collected across government, therefore it is not possible to estimate the cost of not charging for settled status for non-UK EU nationals employed directly by the government.\u201d There are 430,000 civil servants in the UK, according to the ONS, but a year ago it emerged that 15 out of 19 government departments do not know how many EU-born officials they employ \u2013 even though the proportion could be as high as one in 25. One of the few that did, the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy, said just over half its 4,200 staff had voluntarily declared their nationality and of these 4.5% were EU nationals. But it is unclear if these figures would be replicated more broadly. On Wednesday, Islington said it was the first council in the country to pay the Home Office fees for directly employed council staff who were EU citizens. It estimates there are 1,250 EU citizens and others who would need to apply to secure settled status to remain in the UK, at a cost of \u00a380,000. The government has demanded that the 3 million EU nationals legally resident in the UK complete paperwork to prove their right to remain and access public services permanently after Brexit \u2013 and insisted that applicants pay \u00a365 to complete the paperwork.

      "body": "<p>The Brexit result split those who support it. The darker politics that was mixed in with the mainstream leave vote no longer feels the need to hide. On Monday, Anna Soubry, Owen Jones and I were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/07/john-bercow-urges-police-to-do-more-after-nazi-taunts-against-anna-soubry\" title=\"\">confronted by it</a>. But those who verbally attacked and physically harassed us do not speak for ordinary leave voters or the disadvantaged. They have nothing to do with the pro-Brexit protesters, with whom I respectfully disagree.</p> <p>I\u2019ve encountered them before; talking to people around the country is what I do. I\u2019ve engaged with them at People\u2019s Vote marches in Sunderland and outside parliament. I even attended a rally led by the English Defence League\u2019s so-called Tommy Robinson. A figure close to Robinson admitted to me (believing I was pro Brexit) that they knew Brexit would make the country poorer. Knowingly going ahead with a policy that leaves desperately squeezed people even worse off is a betrayal of those they claim to represent.</p> <p>These far-right groups go to the most neglected parts of the country, <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/menace-and-aggression-dfla-is-new-edl-11500806\" title=\"\">like Sunderland</a>, and prey on existing frustrations with a London-centric political system that has left them behind. And instead of pushing to address regional inequality and the democratic powerlessness created by our constituency-based voting system, they point the finger at minorities and the EU. And now that leaving the EU hasn\u2019t worked out, they seek to silence any national dialogue about what to do about it.</p> <p>I\u2019m not afraid of these sad few men in their hi-vis jackets, ironically copying a movement that started in France. But I am afraid they will define what constitutes acceptable debate around Brexit. It would be a disaster if we let the shape of UK democracy and dialogue be fixed by the demands of thugs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/08/pressure-grows-on-police-to-act-over-nazi-slurs-against-anna-soubry\">Bercow urges Met chief to take action against protesters abusing MPs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The abuse and threatening behaviour of these individuals around parliament is unacceptable. And it isn\u2019t just heckling. In this instance, a group of men surrounded an MP. Some individuals in that group aggressively shouted abuse in her face, then appeared to physically block her from entering parliament (her place of work).</p> <p>Plenty of people around the country are frustrated with the Brexit process \u2013 and all but a tiny minority continue to engage in reasonable democratic debate. This debate is absolutely crucial given the vastly different and country-defining options the UK faces. We must be able to have it without feeling like some options are unacceptable because a tiny minority of people are willing to go further, and shout louder, than everyone else. The answer to the far right cannot be to give in. We have never, and will never, let them dictate the terms of debate. When they argue for less democracy, we must call for more.</p> <p>I disagree vehemently with Jacob Rees-Mogg.

      "bodyText": "The Brexit result split those who support it. The darker politics that was mixed in with the mainstream leave vote no longer feels the need to hide. On Monday, Anna Soubry, Owen Jones and I were confronted by it. But those who verbally attacked and physically harassed us do not speak for ordinary leave voters or the disadvantaged. They have nothing to do with the pro-Brexit protesters, with whom I respectfully disagree. I\u2019ve encountered them before; talking to people around the country is what I do. I\u2019ve engaged with them at People\u2019s Vote marches in Sunderland and outside parliament. I even attended a rally led by the English Defence League\u2019s so-called Tommy Robinson. A figure close to Robinson admitted to me (believing I was pro Brexit) that they knew Brexit would make the country poorer. Knowingly going ahead with a policy that leaves desperately squeezed people even worse off is a betrayal of those they claim to represent. These far-right groups go to the most neglected parts of the country, like Sunderland, and prey on existing frustrations with a London-centric political system that has left them behind. And instead of pushing to address regional inequality and the democratic powerlessness created by our constituency-based voting system, they point the finger at minorities and the EU. And now that leaving the EU hasn\u2019t worked out, they seek to silence any national dialogue about what to do about it. I\u2019m not afraid of these sad few men in their hi-vis jackets, ironically copying a movement that started in France. But I am afraid they will define what constitutes acceptable debate around Brexit. It would be a disaster if we let the shape of UK democracy and dialogue be fixed by the demands of thugs. The abuse and threatening behaviour of these individuals around parliament is unacceptable. And it isn\u2019t just heckling. In this instance, a group of men surrounded an MP. Some individuals in that group aggressively shouted abuse in her face, then appeared to physically block her from entering parliament (her place of work). Plenty of people around the country are frustrated with the Brexit process \u2013 and all but a tiny minority continue to engage in reasonable democratic debate. This debate is absolutely crucial given the vastly different and country-defining options the UK faces. We must be able to have it without feeling like some options are unacceptable because a tiny minority of people are willing to go further, and shout louder, than everyone else. The answer to the far right cannot be to give in. We have never, and will never, let them dictate the terms of debate. When they argue for less democracy, we must call for more. I disagree vehemently with Jacob Rees-Mogg. But when far-left activists went to his house and verbally attacked him in front of his children, that was wrong. When Julia Hartley-Brewer, with whom I regularly argue on the radio, receives abuse on Twitter, I defend her. Because there\u2019s a key difference between intense political discourse and gratuitous abuse, no matter where you are on the spectrum. That\u2019s why I\u2019m constantly calling out those on my side who label all Brexit voters uneducated, as if remainers are all experts in EU law. I also criticise those who label all Brexit voters racist, as if one needs to be racist to follow the advice of senior politicians that Brexit would help the NHS. These blanket accusations aren\u2019t just factually wrong, they mean that when we encounter real racism, we won\u2019t be taken seriously \u2013 when a prominent figure within the group shouted \u201cYou ain\u2019t even **** British\u201d at a BAME police officer, for example. The silver lining of this mess is that we can now identify those who sow division and hatred, isolate them and make a real effort to listen to and address the concerns of ordinary Brexit voters. \u2022 Femi Oluwole is chief spokesperson for Our Future, Our Choice",

      "bodyText": "Police hunting those behind a drone flight at Heathrow are investigating whether it was carried out by the same person or group that caused chaos at Gatwick in the run-up to Christmas or if it was a copycat crime. The sighting of the drone just after 5pm on Tuesday caused Heathrow managers to order an emergency one-hour halt of flights taking off. The drone\u2019s short incursion around the north runway was witnessed by police officers, giving police chiefs confidence that it was real and not the result of a mistaken sighting. The device was larger than that seen at Gatwick just before Christmas. After the drone disappeared, measures and equipment stationed at Heathrow were activated which airport bosses hope will neutralise any threat to passenger planes. Officials trying to deter the drones will not know for sure how well the mitigation measures work until they have to deal with another drone sighting, but have studied what worked and did not work at Gatwick. The police also appealed to the public for information about the operator of the drone. On Wednesday the government underlined its commitment to toughen laws on the use of drones around airports after the military had to be deployed at Heathrow following the drone sighting. The de facto deputy prime minister, David Lidington, said ministers were reviewing the legislation after the Heathrow incident raised fears of a repeat of the chaos witnessed at Gatwick before Christmas, when drone sightings caused flights to be suspended for days. Asked about the Heathrow incident on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain on Wednesday, Lidington said: \u201cClearly, the government is looking at the law to see whether there are ways in which it could be strengthened. He added: \u201cWhat I think the airports themselves have to do is step up and do more of is investment in technology to both detect and then stop drones from flying.\u201d The Department for Transport confirmed that the aviation minister, Liz Sugg, and the security minister, Ben Wallace, are due to meet the heads of UK airports on Thursday to discuss resilience against drone attacks.

      "body": "<p>Mention the Quakers, and often the image that springs to mind is the face of porridge oats: a white-haired man in a wide-brimmed hat. <a href=\"http://quaker.org.uk/\">Modern Quakerism</a>, it goes without saying, doesn\u2019t feature many people who look like that \u2013 although we still retain a reputation as trustworthy, unpretentious, wholesome and unthreateningly eccentric. Known officially as the Religious Society of Friends, from our Christian beginnings as the \u201cFriends of Light\u201d, the Quakers are a community without a priesthood or an official creed, but believing in truth, peace, simplicity and equality. Because we believe in everyone\u2019s direct, personal experience of God, we don\u2019t have set services; instead our worship takes place in unscripted Meetings, where the silence is broken only when someone (and it can be anyone) is inspired to say something.</p> <p>In the light of our high ideals, it can be hard for individual Quakers not to feel inadequate. I certainly do. We\u2019re exhorted to \u201clet our lives speak\u201d, and I often feel like my life doesn\u2019t have much to say. But I am a writer. As a community that listens patiently for the truth, Quakers provide a unique place for creativity. The faith that can sit through hours of Meeting \u2013 through boredom, frustration, distraction \u2013 is the same thing that keeps me going when I\u2019m struggling for my next idea. We worship in silence, but we\u2019re waiting for words, which somehow gives me faith that, if I wait in front of a blank page for long enough, the right story will come.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/04/the-binding-bridget-collins-review\">The Binding by Bridget Collins review \u2013 magical tale of supernatural books</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It isn\u2019t only our relationship with silence that has shaped my writing. My novel <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/binding-9780008272111.html\">The Binding</a> was deliberately set in an alternative, secularist 19th century, where God doesn\u2019t figure even in oaths. But the book bindery to which the main character, Emmett, is sent is an austere sanctuary that enshrines the Quaker love of a job well done. The binder to whom he\u2019s apprenticed is prickly and plain-speaking, but utterly faithful to her principles; and through her wisdom he begins to understand that the only trustworthy moral compass is rigorous compassion. And finally, while I hesitate to claim that my novel<em> </em>is a Quakerly story \u2013 it\u2019s shamelessly romantic, indulgent, and a bit too brightly-coloured for that \u2013 perhaps its ultimate conclusion is the most Friendly of all: that truth and love are what save us in the end.</p> <p>Here are 10 Quakers in fiction \u2013 presented, in the light of our testimony of equality, with no intended hierarchy.</p> <p><strong>1. Honor Bright in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/last-runaway-2.html\">The Last Runaway by Tracy Chevalier</a><br></strong>There\u2019s a lot to love about Honor Bright, starting with her name. Leaving her family and Quaker Meeting behind her, she travels from England to America to start a new life, where she\u2019s drawn into the Underground Railroad, the network that supported runaway slaves on their way to freedom. Although Honor finds solace in the quiet of Meeting, what really gives her strength is the grace of sincere friendship.</p> <p><strong>2. Ruth Wilcox in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/18/howards-end-em-forster-classic\">Howards End by EM Forster</a><br></strong>Perhaps it\u2019s surprising that in this novel it\u2019s not the plain-speaking, free-thinking Schlegel family but the wealthy first Mrs Wilcox who is of Quaker descent. She\u2019s unable to hold her own in discussion and apparently bewildered by social issues, but her decision to leave Howards End to Margaret shows inspired generosity and disregard for social mores.</p> <p><strong>3. The Middleton siblings in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/aug/11/featuresreviews.guardianreview16\">Notes from An Exhibition by Patrick Gale</a><br></strong>A subtle and intelligent depiction of a modern family of \u201cbirthright Quakers\u201d as they come to terms with the life and death of their artist mother, this novel conveys the reality of a community of Friends, including the occasional ambivalence of its members. Gale calls Quakerism \u201cmystical but no-nonsense\u201d \u2013 an excellent description \u2013 and he excels in exploring the interior reality of silent worship.</p> <p><strong>4. The people of the Dusty Miller in <a href=\"http://mollygloss.com/published-items/the-dazzle-of-day/\">The Dazzle of Day by Molly Gloss</a><br></strong>A surprising, lyrical science fiction novel in which a Quaker community sets off to settle a new planet. Told in austere and beautiful prose, the story of the spaceship Dusty Miller has a wonderful scene where the community makes a decision through worship \u2013 seeking not consensus but divine guidance \u2013 which depicts the way a moment of illumination can emerge unexpectedly from an apparent impasse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"58e0f4579bcbfbd1da7190156c5262e7da685f02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58e0f4579bcbfbd1da7190156c5262e7da685f02/0_124_2489_3111/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Grimk\u00e9 (1792-1873).\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Speaking truth to power \u2026 engraving of Sarah Grimk\u00e9 (1792-1873).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Granger Collection/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>5. Sarah Grimk\u00e9 in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/invention-of-wings-4.html\">The Invention of Wings by Sue Monk Kidd</a><br></strong>Based on the real Grimk\u00e9, a vocal abolitionist and women\u2019s rights campaigner in the 19th-century US, this is a portrait of a woman learning to speak truth to power. Growing up in a slave-owning household, Sarah is struck dumb by the sight of a woman being whipped, and \u2013 driven by her relationship with Handful, a slave \u2013 she becomes convinced that her ministry is to fight for emancipation. Ironically, in real life she was expelled by her Quaker community for attending her sister\u2019s wedding to an outsider.</p> <p><strong>6. Captain Bildad in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\">Moby-Dick by Herman Melville</a><br></strong>A refreshing counter-example to the upstanding, idealistic Friends that feature elsewhere in this list, Captain Bildad is bitter, hard, avaricious and sanguinary, one of the \u201cfighting Quakers \u2026 Quakers with a vengeance\u201d. Opposed to bloodshed in principle, he has nonetheless spent his youth on the spillage of \u201ctuns and tuns of leviathan gore\u201d and retires to enjoy his substantial income.</p> <p><strong>7. The Paxmore family in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesapeake_(novel)\">Chesapeake by James A Michener</a><br></strong>This novel<em> </em>follows the Quaker Paxmores through many generations, beginning in 1661, when Ruth Brinton Paxmore and her husband Edward are imprisoned and tortured for their beliefs. Later, predictably, the family face conflict over slavery and warmongering, but my favourite part of their story is Edward\u2019s development from a carpenter to a shipbuilder \u2013 forced to invent a boat from first principles, he fails over and over again before he becomes a true artist.</p> <p><strong>8. May Thornton in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/things-a-bright-girl-can-do-565633.html\">Things a Bright Girl Can Do by Sally Nicholls</a><br></strong>In this touching and funny book for young adults about the suffragist movement and the outbreak of the first world war, May (born to a mother who is not only a Quaker but a vegetarian, Fabian, suffragist, Bolshevik and believer in <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/the-rational-dress-societys-gazette\">rational dress for women</a>) is forced to choose between her high principles and her love for Nell, a girl who goes to work in a munitions factory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/06/top-10-novels-about-god\">Top 10 novels about God</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>9. Andrew Raynes in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/03/the-charioteer-mary-renault-review\">The Charioteer by Mary Renault</a><br></strong>A conscientious objector who works in a military hospital, where he falls in love with Laurie, the protagonist, Andrew is endearingly guileless and wholehearted. While a modern audience might wince at the way he has to be \u201cprotected\u201d from the realisation of his own homosexuality (the self-knowledge, it\u2019s suggested, might destroy him), Renault does a great job of making this idealistic young man unexpectedly charming.</p> <p><strong>10. Susanna Thorn in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jan/24/featuresreviews.guardianreview30\">No Shame, No Fear by Ann Turnbull</a><br></strong>A young adult novel set in 1662, this is a love story about Susanna, a Quaker, and Will, the son of a wealthy family. It\u2019s also a vivid evocation of the persecution early Quakers faced, and a reminder that some of what seems quaint now (refusing to doff one\u2019s hat, the use of \u201cthee\u201d to one\u2019s social betters) was once truly radical and subversive.</p> <p>\u2022 The Binding by Bridget Collins is published by HarperCollins, priced \u00a312.99. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/binding-9780008272111.html\">It is available from the Guardian bookshop for \u00a311.43, including free UK p&amp;p</a>.<br></p>",

      "body": "<h2>Jack Clarke, 18, Leeds United</h2> <p>After several game-changing cameos off the bench, the York-born forward was finally handed his full debut by Marcelo Bielsa last Sunday. Raw and direct, Clarke has the ability to grab games by the scruff of the neck; he kickstarted an extraordinary comeback victory at Villa Park last month and made a similar dent against Nottingham Forest and, before that, Sheffield United. Clarke has pleasantly surprised Bielsa, becoming the Argentinian\u2019s go-to man, asked to spark Leeds into life at half-time on no fewer than six occasions since November. \u201cWhen I started to look at his skills I didn\u2019t imagine that he could make the difference as he is,\u201d Bielsa said.</p> <h2>Max Aarons, 19, Norwich City</h2> <p>After unsuccessful spells at Tottenham and QPR, the former Luton schoolboy arrived at Norwich on the same basis as a 16-year-old. Earmarked by academy staff as a future first-team right-back even before earning a contract, he was championed by the then youth coach Matt Gill after shining on tour in Latvia. Aarons, a cousin of the Newcastle winger Rolando, has not looked back since, establishing himself as a fixture in Daniel Farke\u2019s high-flying side and winning four caps for England Under-19s since breaking into the team at the start of the season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/05/the-borrowers-loan-deals-dominate-january-transfer-window\">The borrowers: how loan deals took over the January transfer window | Stuart James</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Antoine Semenyo, 19, Bristol City</h2> <p>It speaks volumes that Manchester United are among the clubs watching Semenyo, who joined Newport on a season\u2019s loan in the summer. His performance helped the Exiles dump Leicester out of the FA Cup and led to Danny Simpson being hooked on the hour. Originally from south London, the powerful forward joined Bristol City almost 18 months ago after being spotted playing for South Gloucestershire and Stroud College, where the Championship club\u2019s academy is based. Semenyo impressed on loan at Bath City last season and made his Bristol City debut in May. Saikou Janneh, the 18-year-old scoring for fun on loan at Torquay under Gary Johnson, the father of City\u2019s manager, Lee, is another exciting forward.</p> <h2>Tom Bayliss, 19, Coventry City</h2> <p>The youngster is the latest academy graduate to excel in the first team, following in the footsteps of James Maddison and Callum Wilson. Bayliss will likely make his 50th league appearance on Saturday and the ball-playing central midfielder has been at the heart of the Sky Blues\u2019 rise since his full debut a little over a year ago. Tall and slight, Bayliss signed as an under-11 following an open trial but has had to overcome a couple of setbacks, including a hairline back fracture in his mid-teens, and the very late developer was made to wait before being offered a scholarship. \u201cJames always lit up training and the games, but Tom\u2019s journey was a lot more steady than that \u2013 in a good way,\u201d said academy manager Richard Stevens.</p> <h2>Arvin Appiah, 18, Nottingham Forest</h2> <p>\u201cRemember the name,\u201d said the Forest academy manager, Gary Brazil, last summer. There is a reason why Forest are keen to tie the winger, who has just turned 18 and made his league debut on New Year\u2019s Day, to a new long-term contract.

      "bodyText": "Jack Clarke, 18, Leeds United After several game-changing cameos off the bench, the York-born forward was finally handed his full debut by Marcelo Bielsa last Sunday. Raw and direct, Clarke has the ability to grab games by the scruff of the neck; he kickstarted an extraordinary comeback victory at Villa Park last month and made a similar dent against Nottingham Forest and, before that, Sheffield United. Clarke has pleasantly surprised Bielsa, becoming the Argentinian\u2019s go-to man, asked to spark Leeds into life at half-time on no fewer than six occasions since November. \u201cWhen I started to look at his skills I didn\u2019t imagine that he could make the difference as he is,\u201d Bielsa said. Max Aarons, 19, Norwich City After unsuccessful spells at Tottenham and QPR, the former Luton schoolboy arrived at Norwich on the same basis as a 16-year-old. Earmarked by academy staff as a future first-team right-back even before earning a contract, he was championed by the then youth coach Matt Gill after shining on tour in Latvia. Aarons, a cousin of the Newcastle winger Rolando, has not looked back since, establishing himself as a fixture in Daniel Farke\u2019s high-flying side and winning four caps for England Under-19s since breaking into the team at the start of the season. Antoine Semenyo, 19, Bristol City It speaks volumes that Manchester United are among the clubs watching Semenyo, who joined Newport on a season\u2019s loan in the summer. His performance helped the Exiles dump Leicester out of the FA Cup and led to Danny Simpson being hooked on the hour. Originally from south London, the powerful forward joined Bristol City almost 18 months ago after being spotted playing for South Gloucestershire and Stroud College, where the Championship club\u2019s academy is based. Semenyo impressed on loan at Bath City last season and made his Bristol City debut in May. Saikou Janneh, the 18-year-old scoring for fun on loan at Torquay under Gary Johnson, the father of City\u2019s manager, Lee, is another exciting forward. Tom Bayliss, 19, Coventry City The youngster is the latest academy graduate to excel in the first team, following in the footsteps of James Maddison and Callum Wilson. Bayliss will likely make his 50th league appearance on Saturday and the ball-playing central midfielder has been at the heart of the Sky Blues\u2019 rise since his full debut a little over a year ago. Tall and slight, Bayliss signed as an under-11 following an open trial but has had to overcome a couple of setbacks, including a hairline back fracture in his mid-teens, and the very late developer was made to wait before being offered a scholarship. \u201cJames always lit up training and the games, but Tom\u2019s journey was a lot more steady than that \u2013 in a good way,\u201d said academy manager Richard Stevens. Arvin Appiah, 18, Nottingham Forest \u201cRemember the name,\u201d said the Forest academy manager, Gary Brazil, last summer. There is a reason why Forest are keen to tie the winger, who has just turned 18 and made his league debut on New Year\u2019s Day, to a new long-term contract. Appiah, another graduate from the revered academy, spent pre-season with the first team and has been tracked by top-flight clubs since shining for the under-23s as a 15-year-old. Born in the Netherlands to Ghanaian parents, Appiah has played for England through the age groups and was part of the under-17s squad that reached the semi-finals of the European Championships in May. A full-back\u2019s worst nightmare, Appiah ghosts past players. \u201cI think 2019 will be a good year for him,\u201d Aitor Karanka said.

Anne and her favourites are in the grip of some malign madness that exists independently of each. Apart from everything else, The Favourite is a fascinating test case of auteurism.

This amiable, undemanding entertainment might yet snaffle a lot of silverware, by pulling off the vital trick of getting itself talked about: it might even dislodge The Favourite as the topic of industry conversation, and for some it goes down easier than Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s dark, complex, brilliant comedy-horror. We all know about underdog films which became loved when they came out on home entertainment. Maybe film historians need to talk about the films which became powerhouse contenders when they were distributed on screener discs, those mouthwatering presents which come through the letterboxes of privileged Bafta voters (full disclosure: I\u2019m one). Over the Christmas and New Year break, Bafta constituents have been pondering which of their discs to slide into the DVD player \u2014 and Bohemian Rhapsody is a very relaxing watch.

It certainly seems better than Green Book, the true-life (but embellished) story of Mahershala Ali\u2019s brilliant African-American musician being ferried around by his Italian-American driver, played by Viggo Mortensen. It perhaps looks like another exercise in liberal timidity, a white-black odd-couple pairing which arguably suggests that the growing pains of the white character are equivalent in importance to the black man\u2019s injustices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ed2e212c3f6a2c018e4e565afeb90079e81abde\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ed2e212c3f6a2c018e4e565afeb90079e81abde/0_173_2958_1775/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Siobhan Finneran, left, and Molly Wright in Apostasy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Siobhan Finneran, left, and Molly Wright in Apostasy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Curzon films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps the most interesting category list, and certainly the most important for its nominees is the outstanding British debut, which includes Daniel Kokotajlo\u2019s searing Apostasy, Michael Pearce\u2019s Beast, Chris Kelly\u2019s Cambodian Spring, Leanne Welham\u2019s Pili, and also Richard Billingham\u2019s Ray &amp; Liz, starring Justin Salinger, a film which has been quietly picking up international festival love.

The other players are Adam McKay\u2019s Dick Cheney satire Vice, Spike Lee\u2019s BlacKkKlansman, Peter Farrelly\u2019s Green Book and Pawel Pawlikowski\u2019s Cold War with six, five, four and four and there is scope for a groan that Pawlikowski\u2019s wonderful film is not doing better than that. It certainly seems better than Green Book, the true-life (but embellished) story of Mahershala Ali\u2019s brilliant African-American musician being ferried around by his Italian-American driver, played by Viggo Mortensen. It perhaps looks like another exercise in liberal timidity, a white-black odd-couple pairing which arguably suggests that the growing pains of the white character are equivalent in importance to the black man\u2019s injustices. Perhaps the most interesting category list, and certainly the most important for its nominees is the outstanding British debut, which includes Daniel Kokotajlo\u2019s searing Apostasy, Michael Pearce\u2019s Beast, Chris Kelly\u2019s Cambodian Spring, Leanne Welham\u2019s Pili, and also Richard Billingham\u2019s Ray &amp; Liz, starring Justin Salinger, a film which has been quietly picking up international festival love. My tip here is Apostasy. So The Favourite continues its awards season in the sun, spearheaded by Olivia Colman\u2019s classic, unique acting performance: and I for one wouldn\u2019t argue with it.",

It is broadcast live on ABC in the US, on Sky in the UK, and on Channel Nine in Australia. The red carpet portion of the show is broadcast live by the E! network.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who decides on the Oscars?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Oscars are voted for by members of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (aka Ampas), which currently numbers just under 8,000 voting members, divided into 17 separate branches, including actors, directors, costume designers, etc. (To join, names have to be proposed and approved by individual branches.) The Academy has received considerable criticism in recent years for the perceived white/male/elderly bias of its voters \u2013 and a drive to create a more diverse membership was instituted after the #OscarsSoWhite campaign in 2016.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many Oscars are there and how does a film get nominated?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There are 24 categories \u2013 ranging from best picture to best sound mixing \u2013 presented on Oscar night. The Academy also gives out a bunch of Scientific and Technical awards: this year, for example, it will honour the people behind Adobe Photoshop and the Medusa Performance Capture System. Also there are the honorary Oscars: this year they are going to actor Cicely Tyson, producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, Steven Spielberg's PR flack Marvin Levy and composer Lalo Schifrin (of Mission: Impossible renown).</p>\n    <p>Each of the main awards has its own rules and regulations for slimming down all the eligible entries \u2013 first to a longlist, then a shortlist, then the final nomination list. In most categories, to be eligible a film must have been released for seven days in Los Angeles before 31 December, and a specialist committee makes the selection for the nomination \u2013 which is then voted on by the full membership. For the best foreign language film award, each country can submit one film (89 were put forward this year), before a committee boils them down to a final five.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do Oscar winners win?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Oscar statuette isn't solid gold:&nbsp;it's gold-plated bronze on a black metal base. It is 34 cm tall and weighs 3.8 kg. While the Academy doesn't own it once it is handed over, its acceptance is conditional that recipients won't sell them unless they have offered them back to the Academy for $1.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Favourites have emerged, and the prospect of any genuinely surprising nominees unfortunately dims with each stop on the awards season freight train. With that in mind, here\u2019s a last-ditch appeal to the Academy on behalf of 11 performers who\u2019ve been snubbed by the awards-season-industrial complex \u2013 some on account of admittedly stiff competition, others because they appear in smaller, less Oscar-baity films that staged less robust PR campaigns, and a few, sadly, because the movies in which they appear aren\u2019t in English.</p> \n<h2>Carey Mulligan in Wildlife</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy1RECX9Irk\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sy1RECX9Irk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Yes, the race for best actress is as stacked with terrific performances as it\u2019s been in years, but the exclusion of Carey Mulligan from the conversation is as strange and egregious an oversight as they come. In Wildlife, the directorial debut from Paul Dano, Mulligan plays Jeanette, a 1960s housewife left to her own devices after her unemployed husband abandons her and her son to fight wildfires in the forests of Montana. In a narrative presented mostly from the perspective of Jeanette\u2019s teenage son, Joe, Mulligan gives the best acting performance of the year, male or female: she\u2019s fickle, fierce, combustible and impish, her tone of voice often oscillating from cheerful to coarse in accordance with the character\u2019s mood. In a story that\u2019s more or less about a kid coming to recognize and reckon with his parent\u2019s flaws, Mulligan plays Jeanette with a thrilling unpredictability that calls to mind Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence \u2013 and forces us, as viewers, to recount the moment we realized our parents were human, too.</p> \n<h2>Daniel Kaluuya and Elizabeth Debicki in Widows</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XmlOdqG0gY\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5XmlOdqG0gY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>In a film with a cast as numerous and decorated as Widows\u2019 ensemble \u2013 Viola Davis, Liam Neeson, Colin Farrell, Robert Duvall, Carrie Coon, Bryan Tyree Henry, Michelle Rodriguez, Cynthia Erivo, and Jacki Weaver are all here \u2013 it takes a real howitzer of a performance to stand out from the bunch. But in Steve McQueen\u2019s follow-up to 12 Years a Slave, Daniel Kaluuya and Elizabeth Debicki do just that, occupying opposite ends of the film\u2019s vast and frequently fluctuating moral continuum. As Jatemme Manning, the mob enforcer to his brother Jamal\u2019s political campaign, Kaluuya oozes menace: to look into his eyes as he stares down a lackey spitting a few rap bars is to vow never to freestyle again. Debicki, meanwhile, is the film\u2019s heart, a damaged woman in thrall to her abusive mother and husband who joins the Viola Davis-led heist and convinces you her life depends it. Both performances, though overlooked by most awards bodies (save a few critics\u2019 groups), are emotionally rich but tactful, too, governed less by histrionics than meaningful glances and grimaces.</p> \n<h2>Marina de Tavira in Roma</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BS27ngZtxg\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6BS27ngZtxg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The star of the year\u2019s best film, Roma\u2019s Yalitza Aparicio, still has an outside shot at nabbing a best actress nomination. But in a crowded year for supporting actress, headlined by Regina King, Amy Adams and the women of The Favourite, Aparicio\u2019s co-star Marina de Tavira has fallen through the cracks. That\u2019s a shame, since what she does with her role as the matriarch of a household in turmoil is pretty breathtaking. Her character Sofia swings like a pendulum; she lets out strident commands (\u201c\u00bf<em>Ad\u00f3nde</em> <em>vas?</em>\u201d she screams at her disobedient son); provides comic relief (watch her attempt to wriggle her Ford Galaxy between two trucks on a Mexico City freeway); and allows her character\u2019s compassion and dejection to surface in gestures both big and small, a vast arsenal of actorly gifts at her disposal. \u201cNo matter what they tell you, as women, we are always alone,\u201d she says to Cleo in a moment of desolation that\u2019s brilliantly, perhaps surprisingly, punctuated by a burst of drunken physical comedy. In the humble opinion of this writer, it was the year\u2019s second-best performance (a smidgen behind Mulligan).</p> \n<h2>Steven Yeun in Burning</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oihHs2Errwk\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oihHs2Errwk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The year\u2019s best, most cryptic villain \u2013 a personification of the \u201cyou v the guy she told you not to worry about\u201d meme \u2013 was Steven Yeun\u2019s Ben in Burning, the director Lee Chang-dong\u2019s hypnotizing adaptation of Haruki Murakami\u2019s short story. Think Jay Gatsby meets Patrick Bateman meets Dickie Greenleaf: Yeun plays this smooth-talking cosmopolite with a pathological charm that never quite reveals itself in full, which is precisely what makes the characterization so uniquely chilling and seductive. It\u2019s a testament to Yeun\u2019s commitment that Ben\u2019s veneer of disquieting swagger never breaks: he yawns, laughs, speaks, smokes, shakes hands and discloses his casual pyromania all with the same air of arrogant self-possession. Critics\u2019 groups out of Chicago, Los Angeles and Toronto recognized Yeun as the year\u2019s best supporting actor, so perhaps it isn\u2019t asking <em>too </em>much that the Academy take note too.</p> \n<h2>Helena Howard in Madeline\u2019s Madeline</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew1eQBbWCx8\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ew1eQBbWCx8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>This 20-year-old actor\u2019s debut in Josephine Decker\u2019s brilliant Madeline\u2019s Madeline is on par with Natalie Portman in Black Swan and Philip Seymour Hoffman in Synecdoche, New York, in the pantheon of art-and-life-blurring roles. A gifted actress in a New York City-based experimental theatre troupe, and a mercurial teenager on the verge of a psychotic break, Howard\u2019s Madeline is that rare characterization of an adolescent that\u2019s refreshingly unmoored from convention. Immersed in her subjectivity, we experience Madeline\u2019s sense of disorientation in the world and then watch her bring pain and suffering into uncomfortably sharp focus, particularly in a dramatic monologue in which she\u2019s asked to portray her own mother. In a year of outstanding film debuts from young female actors (Aparicio in Roma, Elsie Fisher in Eight Grade, Kiki Layne in If Beale Street Could Talk), Howard\u2019s was particularly noteworthy.</p> \n<h2><strong>Lakeith Stanfield in Sorry to Bother You</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d49yhydBOqc\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d49yhydBOqc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>In the wake of the Golden Globes, Christian Bale may very well ride his win to a best actor Oscar, with Bradley Cooper and Viggo Mortensen trailing close behind. Each represents a different version of the kind of muscular, immersive leading performance the Academy likes to honor. What Lakeith Stanfield does in Boots Riley\u2019s Sorry to Bother You, however, is considerably different. As Cassius \u201cCash\u201d Green, an upwardly mobile telemarketer, Stanfield is often comically incredulous. Despite his ascent in the world of tech, things happen <em>to </em>Cash more often than he makes them happen, and Stanfield plays it with a certain affable bemusement. It\u2019s one of those performances that works in service of a film-maker\u2019s vision, in this case Riley\u2019s wild satire of a late-capitalist wasteland and its machine full of cogs.</p> \n<h2>Juliette Binoche in Let the Sunshine In</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3nVLH8lPoM\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h3nVLH8lPoM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Rare is a protagonist, especially a female, middle-aged protagonist, as multitudinous as Isabelle of Claire Denis\u2019 radiant romcom Let the Sunshine In, the lifeblood of which is Juliette Binoche\u2019s effusive, heartfelt and guileless lead performance as a woman looking for love. Isabelle, and as far as we can tell, Binoche too, feels everything to the fullest extent, and throughout the film, a dialogue-heavy procession of encounters with different men, her face is a transient canvas of emotions experienced not one-by-one but all at once. Watch her, for instance, in the film\u2019s final scene, a long discussion with a clairvoyant who predicts the future of Isabelle\u2019s various dalliances. His every divination is met with its own reaction: Isabelle\u2019s neck tenses up, or she laughs incredulously, or her smile broadens, or her lips purse. It\u2019s a nakedly human and life-affirming performance from one of our greatest actors.</p> \n<h2>Sakura And\u00f4 in Shoplifters</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD84NmCTLPU\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xD84NmCTLPU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The slow burn and eventual emotional gut punch of Hirokazu Kore-eda\u2019s Shoplifters is reflected most clearly in the supporting performance of Sakura And\u00f4, who plays her character, Nobuyo, with a delicate touch not dissimilar to the film\u2019s direction. She is sincere but necessarily stealthy, loving and devious, easily one of the most sympathetic and likable characters on film this year, which is odd if you come across a bare-boned synopsis of the movie: a family of savvy shoplifters kidnaps a young girl. In a scene where Nobuyo is interrogated by Japanese police, her eyes evince profound sadness and principled determination, like vectors for Kore-eda and the film\u2019s touching exploration of a family linked by trust instead of blood.</p> \n<h2>Joaquin Phoenix in You Were Never Really Here</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgQ-i9IYLZQ\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WgQ-i9IYLZQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>If it were up to me, Joaquin Phoenix would have two Oscars to his name and a third \u2013 for his performance as Joe in Lynne Ramsey\u2019s You Were Never Really Here \u2013 on the way. Alas, Phoenix\u2019s harsh, uncompromising turn as a hired gun who rescues sex-trafficked young girls has been mostly ignored by major awards bodies and critics\u2019 groups, even though he took home the best actor prize at the Cannes film festival, where the film premiered in 2017. Here, Phoenix and his body appear more lived-in than ever, the lines that branch across his face suggesting toil and trauma. With more action than talk, Phoenix and Ramsey invite us into the character\u2019s wounded headspace, effectively evoking the sense of rage and violent resolve that compels him to do what he does.</p> \n<h2>Maggie Gyllenhaal in The Kindergarten Teacher</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n1NP6w5lXs\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8n1NP6w5lXs?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>As if the best actress conversation weren\u2019t crowded enough, here\u2019s another tour de force to consider. As a kindergarten teacher and failed poet in Sara Colangelo\u2019s remake of the 2015 Israeli film of the same name, Maggie Gyllenhaal gives the year\u2019s most anxiety-inducing performance, embodying obsessive compulsion and intellectual unease. Her character Lisa takes what seems like an innocent, maternal interest in the poetic ingenuity of one of her students, seeing it as her responsibility to cultivate his talent before it\u2019s soiled, presumably like her own, by an increasingly vainglorious world. What ensues is a crescendo of discomfiting events that are both more and less ethically ambiguous than they feel, anchored by Gyllenhaal\u2019s tremendous ability to be entirely consumed by her character\u2019s one-track mind and strange sense of duty.</p>",

As a kindergarten teacher and failed poet in Sara Colangelo\u2019s remake of the 2015 Israeli film of the same name, Maggie Gyllenhaal gives the year\u2019s most anxiety-inducing performance, embodying obsessive compulsion and intellectual unease.

The deliveries on Wednesday sparked an emergency \u201chazardous material\u201d response and, in some cases, evacuation. \u201cWe handled the package according to our standard procedures and in close co-ordination with local authorities ... who are investigating the incident,\u201d a US spokesman said. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Manuela Erb, the honorary consul of the consulate of Switzerland at Ashwood, said they also received a suspicious package. \u201cIt was in an envelope,\u201d she said. Specialist firefighters were seen carrying large bags emblazoned with \u201cDanger asbestos\u201d as they left the Indian and South Korean consulates on St Kilda road. Both Pakistan and New Zealand\u2019s offices received envelopes containing small plastic bags with what appeared to be concrete and asbestos inside, ABC news reports. Emergency services workers also attended the Greek, French, Italian, Spanish and Turkey consulates in Melbourne. Victoria police issued a statement saying it was aware of \u201ca number of consulate offices in Melbourne today receiving suspicious packages\u201d. \u201cAt this time we believe the matter is targeted and not impacting the general community,\u201d the statement said. On Wednesday afternoon, the Emergency Management Victoria website also showed firefighters were responding to reports of hazardous materials at the British consulate general in Collins Street. Hazardous material warnings were also shown near the Indonesian, Thai, Egyptian and Japanese consulates in Melbourne. The New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said staff at its William Street consulate were evacuated. \u201cThe New Zealand consulate general in Melbourne received a suspicious parcel this afternoon,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cStaff were evacuated from the consulate as a precautionary measure.\u201d Two fire trucks, a hazardous materials vehicle and police cars attended the consulate general of India where staff were also cleared from the building. They were allowed to re-enter by 3pm when the area was deemed safe. Ambulance Victoria confirmed a number of patients were examined at multiple consulates. \u201cNo patients have required treatment or transport to hospital,\u201d it said in a statement. Authorities did not confirm the specific locations or intended targets of any of the packages, but the Australian federal police confirmed it was investigating. \u201cThe packages are being examined by attending emergency services,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cThe circumstances surrounding these incidents are being investigated.\u201d It is not known which embassies in Canberra have been affected, although it is understood a hazmat team was performing an unrelated training activity at the US embassy. The alerts come after Sydney\u2019s Argentinian consulate was partially evacuated on Monday following reports of a suspicious substance. The powder, similarly contained in clear plastic bags within an envelope, was deemed not dangerous. Guardian Australia has sought comment from the AFP.",

It\u2019s part of Wiley\u2019s exhibition <a href=\"https://www.slam.org/exhibitions/kehinde-wiley-st-louis/\">Saint Louis</a>, which runs until 10 February, where 11 paintings of St Louis locals are painted in the style of old masters, a comment on the absence of black portraits in museums.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jul/06/kehinde-wiley-equestrian-portrait-of-michael-jackson\">Kehinde Wiley\u2019s Equestrian Portrait of Michael Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe great heroic, often white, male hero dominates the picture plane and becomes larger than life, historic and significant,\u201d said Wiley over the phone from his Brooklyn studio. \u201cThat great historic storytelling of myth-making or propaganda is something we inherit as artists. I wanted to be able to weaponize and translate it into a means of celebrating female presence.\u201d</p> <p>It all started last year when the museum invited Wiley to create an exhibition, which prompted Wiley to visit the museum\u2019s sprawling collection. Noticing the lack of people of color on the walls, he ventured out into the suburbs for subjects to paint, including Ferguson, a hub of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/22/st-louis-missouri-ferguson-protests-black-lives-matter\">Black Lives Matter movement</a> since the police shooting of Mike Brown. (\u201cThere\u2019s a very strong dissonance between this gilded museum on a hill and the communities in Ferguson,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/kehinde-wiley-on-painting-president-obama-michael-jackson-and-the-people-of-ferguson\">Wiley recently said</a>). He put out a public call and personally invited locals for a casting inside the museum.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the beginning, it was about a response to the museum as a strange metaphorical divide between the culture, not only in St Louis, but in America at large,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kind of inside-outside nature of museum culture can be alienating and St Louis has one of the best American collections of classical works, so I wanted to use the poses from these paintings for potential sitters from the community.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"be094060aa21d8f1551ebbd975ce9cbd2dca8ec5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be094060aa21d8f1551ebbd975ce9cbd2dca8ec5/0_0_2400_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kehinde Wiley - Three Girls in a Wood\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kehinde Wiley \u2013 Three Girls in a Wood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kehinde Wiley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wiley has painted St Louis natives as stately figures, wearing their day-to-day garb, even showing women in traditionally male poses. Shontay Hanes from Wellston is painted in the pose of Francesco Salviati\u2019s <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Francesco_Salviati_-_Portrait_of_a_Florentine_Nobleman.jpg\">Portrait of a Florentine Nobleman</a>, while her sister Ashley Cooper\u2019s pose is similar to that of <a href=\"https://www.slam.org/collection/objects/8329/\">Charles I</a> in the portrait by Daniel Mytens the Elder.</p> <p>As the models posed for him, Wiley took hundreds of photos, which he took back to his New York studio. He picked the photos that had the strongest presence and painted them. \u201cMy process is less about the original sitter, nor is it entirely about the individual,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange middle space that is marked by a kind of anonymity, standing in for a history that is not your own. A pose that is not your own.

      "bodyText": "When the American artist Kehinde Wiley \u2013 known by many for his presidential portrait of Barack Obama \u2013 walked into a Little Caesars restaurant in St Louis, he didn\u2019t know he\u2019d walk out with models for his next painting. He saw a group of African American women sitting at a table and was inspired to paint them for Three Girls in A Wood, a painting on view at the St Louis Art Museum. It\u2019s part of Wiley\u2019s exhibition Saint Louis, which runs until 10 February, where 11 paintings of St Louis locals are painted in the style of old masters, a comment on the absence of black portraits in museums. \u201cThe great heroic, often white, male hero dominates the picture plane and becomes larger than life, historic and significant,\u201d said Wiley over the phone from his Brooklyn studio. \u201cThat great historic storytelling of myth-making or propaganda is something we inherit as artists. I wanted to be able to weaponize and translate it into a means of celebrating female presence.\u201d It all started last year when the museum invited Wiley to create an exhibition, which prompted Wiley to visit the museum\u2019s sprawling collection. Noticing the lack of people of color on the walls, he ventured out into the suburbs for subjects to paint, including Ferguson, a hub of the Black Lives Matter movement since the police shooting of Mike Brown. (\u201cThere\u2019s a very strong dissonance between this gilded museum on a hill and the communities in Ferguson,\u201d Wiley recently said). He put out a public call and personally invited locals for a casting inside the museum. \u201cFrom the beginning, it was about a response to the museum as a strange metaphorical divide between the culture, not only in St Louis, but in America at large,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kind of inside-outside nature of museum culture can be alienating and St Louis has one of the best American collections of classical works, so I wanted to use the poses from these paintings for potential sitters from the community.\u201d Wiley has painted St Louis natives as stately figures, wearing their day-to-day garb, even showing women in traditionally male poses. Shontay Hanes from Wellston is painted in the pose of Francesco Salviati\u2019s Portrait of a Florentine Nobleman, while her sister Ashley Cooper\u2019s pose is similar to that of Charles I in the portrait by Daniel Mytens the Elder. As the models posed for him, Wiley took hundreds of photos, which he took back to his New York studio. He picked the photos that had the strongest presence and painted them. \u201cMy process is less about the original sitter, nor is it entirely about the individual,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange middle space that is marked by a kind of anonymity, standing in for a history that is not your own. A pose that is not your own. There is a kind of complexity there that is not reducible to traditional painting.\u201d There is also a painting in the exhibit which mimics Gerard ter Borch\u2019s portrait of Jacob de Graeff, which inspired Wiley\u2019s portrait of Brincel Kape\u2019li Wiggins Jr, who is wearing a Ferguson hat as a way of showing the city in a positive light. Wiley, who grew up in South Central Los Angeles in the 1980s, had an a-ha moment when he first saw the works of Kerry James Marshall in a museum when he was young \u2013 it proved to him that African American figures belonged on museum walls, too. He studied painting in Russia at the tender age of 12, chased down his Nigerian father at 20, graduated from Yale in 2001 and has been painting African Americans \u2013 including a commissioned portrait of Michael Jackson \u2013 as old masters icons since the early 2000s. \u201cWhen you think of America itself and its own narratives, there are inspiring narratives and the notion of American exceptionalism,\u201d said Wiley. \u201cIt\u2019s the place where the world looks to for the best of human aspirations. That narrative is highly under question at this moment.\u201d Despite becoming royalty in his own respect, as Wiley\u2019s star-studded lifestyle has him posing for selfies alongside Naomi Campbell and Prince Charles on Instagram, he sees his country differently now, compared with when he started painting professionally. \u201cBy virtue of our strength, we\u2019re at this point of weakness and inability to see a lot of the folly that is set in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there is an overbuilt privilege that starts to come into play and inability to feel empathy for perceived outsiders.\u201d Since his leafy Obama portrait was unveiled last year, his life has drastically changed. \u201cI don\u2019t have to explain what I do any more,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes it a lot easier, \u2018He\u2019s the guy who did that.\u2019 It\u2019s going to be on my headstone.\u201d As for his painting of three women he found at a pizza parlor, it\u2019s a departure from where he first began \u2013 which was classically trained painting of white women. \u201cSo much of my upbringing as an artist was painting white women often displayed nude,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first started painting black women, it was a return home.\u201d While Wiley is known for choosing models that stand out to him, he can never predict what will work in the studio.

      "bodyText": "Last week, during a particularly tense moment in an equally tense match between Manchester City and Liverpool, the City manager, Pep Guardiola, threw his snood on the ground in a tantrum. There was no need (City won), but when viewed alongside Liverpool manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp, a manager who tends to wear his own snood-like \u201cgaiter\u201d wrapped around his face throughout an entire match, it suggested there is more to the snood-gaiter-whatever than meets the eye. It is not simply there to keep us warm: it is a tool, a shield, and a glaring example of how accessories can be weaponised without the wearer losing face. As a rule, we should probably avoid trendspotting during displays of anxiety. Comfort dressing and giant scarves probably have less to do with, say, the ache of Brexit and more to do with the weather. Still, it\u2019s hard not to make some sort of link when you see men\u2019s fashion emotionally played out in the Premier League. Scarves, snoods, gaiters, ties, blankets and shawls are obviously big business in winter. We know this because they are one of the few trends that are as reliable on the street as they are on the catwalk, even if they tend to be worn differently. The usual gender issues don\u2019t apply here; this neckwear is not gender-specific, and men are having fun with it \u2013 scarves are a safe space for colour and are cheaper than a new coat. The current run of men\u2019s shows, which just wrapped up in London and are en route to Florence, were awash with all manner of neckwear worn in a myriad of ways. At Per G\u00f6tesson, stubby versions were worn like neckerchiefs with little warmth. And at A-Cold-Wall* and Lou Dalton, large scarves were wrapped around the models\u2019 arms like cuffs, a florid technique that did little other than showcase the pattern. At Bobby Abley, however, they were long and cheerigly yellow, and worn with balaclavas \u2013 which makes more sense in a nuclear winter. Sometimes fashion does kowtow to the practical. On the high street, scarves have a new elasticity. The bestselling accessory at Zara men is a small snood, while Weekday has just launched a line of men\u2019s scarves in preppy block colours. Gaiters, the latest addition to Urban Outfitters winter armoury launched this season, are effectively snoods rebranded for millennials. They are compact, fleecey, and insidiously nerdy, tapping into the hiking trend that continues to run this season, although Zara does a fun version that looks like a padded swimming band. More soothing are the swathes of oversized scarves at New Look, although styling these can be a minefield. \u201cWhen it\u2019s really cold, no scarf is insulating enough. I tend to grab the nearest blanket and wrap it round myself,\u201d says the senior style editor at Matchesfashion.com, Chris Hobbs. He flits between a yellow Loewe scarf and a large mohair version by Acne Studios, but remains inspired by Lenny Kravitz\u2019s giant-scarf moment. The US fashion writer Max Berlinger sits in the opposite camp. \u201cI hate oversized ones that are chunky and look like they\u2019re swallowing your head,\u201d he says. \u201cI think scarves are best when they are securely fastened at your neck and keep you warm.

The ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall will be hosted by Joanna Lumley and broadcast \u2013 about 90 minutes after it actually happens \u2013 on BBC ONE.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who votes for the Baftas?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Baftas are voted for by around 6,500 members of the British Film and Television Academy. These are industry workers who have to apply for membership \u2013 and pay an annual subscription of \u00a3450. Each category in the shortlists is decided by a chapter of around 100 specialists in that area. Once the shortlists are announced, all voters can have their say. If they haven't seen a particular film, they are supposed to abstain from voting in that category \u2013 but this is unenforced.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why do they matter? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Baftas matter on their own terms, third only to the Golden Globes and the Oscars as prestige gongs. A Bafta win adds critical kudos \u2013 and, hopefully, box office \u2013 to a film, as well as credibility to an individual's career. They also matter because of their proximity to the Oscars. Until 2001, the Baftas took place in April or May, but since the move to about a fortnight before the Academy Awards, their importance increased. This is because voting for the Oscars closes a few days after the Baftas, meaning it's the final chance for candidates to impress with their speeches - or for Oscar voters to seek to redress apparent miscarriages of justice. The Bafta and Oscar voting bases overlap considerably, too: around 500 people are thought to vote for both.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So do the big winners generally mirror each other?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not necessarily. A recent survey found the Baftas were only the fourth best Oscars bellwether \u2013 after the DGA, PGA and SAG awards. Since 2001, they've predicted the best picture winner eight times out of a possible 17, diverging the past four years running, opting for Three Billboards over The Shape of Water, La La Land over Moonlight, The Revenant&nbsp;over Spotlight and&nbsp;Boyhood&nbsp;over Birdman. Their form is stronger when it comes to the acting categories, though they do consistently favour homegrown talent.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do winners actually get? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A big bronze mask on a marble base, which Bafta reserves the right to buy back for \u00a31 should the recipient give it to anyone other than their children. Plus a certificate, with which the winner can do what they like.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/10/can-you-ever-forgive-me-review-melissa-mccarthy\">Can You Ever Forgive Me?</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/12/mary-poppins-returns-review-sequel-emily-blunt\">Mary Poppins Returns</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/16/mary-queen-of-scots-review-saoirse-ronan-josie-rourke\">Mary, Queen of Scots</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/21/stan-and-ollie-review-laurel-and-hardy-steve-coogan-john-c-reilly\">Stan &amp; Ollie</a> have three nominations each. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/04/steve-coogan-interview-stan-and-ollie\">Steve Coogan</a> was nominated over co-star John C Reilly in the latter, perhaps betraying voters\u2019 British bias, although Emily Blunt was passed over for her part as the magical nanny, with Mary Poppins Returns up only for technical awards.</p> \n<p>Significant snubs included Steve McQueen, whose followup to 12 Years a Slave, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/09/widows-review-steve-mcqueen-dazzles-with-masterful-thriller\">Widows</a>, scored just one nomination, for leading actress Viola Davis. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/10/if-beale-street-could-talk-review-barry-jenkins-tragic-romance-soars\">If Beale Street Could Talk</a>\u2019s Regina King was also omitted, despite being favourite for the best supporting actress Oscar.</p> \n<p>Mike Leigh\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/01/peterloo-review-grit-and-brilliance-in-mike-leighs-very-british-massacre\">Peterloo</a> also failed to pick up a single nomination, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/14/50-best-films-2018-uk-us-black-panther\">Black Panther</a> took just one (for visual effects).

The film, which swept the board at the British independent film awards in December, with a record 10 wins, is a contender in all the major categories other than best actor. The Favourite converted just one of its five nominations into a win (for Olivia Colman) at last Sunday\u2019s Golden Globe awards, with controversial road trip drama Green Book the biggest victor, taking best supporting actor, best screenplay and best comedy or musical. Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, meanwhile, won best drama and best actor in a drama for Rami Malek. That film also performed strongly with British voters (though it was significantly omitted from the best film shortlist), taking it to level pegging \u2013 on seven nominations \u2013 with arch musical rival A Star is Born. Also on seven are First Man, the Neil Armstrong biopic starring Ryan Gosling, which has so far met with little awards love, and with Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s much-lauded Roma. Meanwhile Vice, the Dick Cheney biopic which bagged Christian Bale the best actor in a comedy or musical prize on Sunday, came away with six nominations. Spike Lee\u2019s BlacKkKlansman has five, and Green Book and Pawel Pawlikowski\u2019s Cold War have four each. Can You Ever Forgive Me?, Mary Poppins Returns, Mary, Queen of Scots and Stan &amp; Ollie have three nominations each. Steve Coogan was nominated over co-star John C Reilly in the latter, perhaps betraying voters\u2019 British bias, although Emily Blunt was passed over for her part as the magical nanny, with Mary Poppins Returns up only for technical awards. Significant snubs included Steve McQueen, whose followup to 12 Years a Slave, Widows, scored just one nomination, for leading actress Viola Davis. If Beale Street Could Talk\u2019s Regina King was also omitted, despite being favourite for the best supporting actress Oscar. Mike Leigh\u2019s Peterloo also failed to pick up a single nomination, while Black Panther took just one (for visual effects). Peterloo marks a rare failure for Film4, which picked up 20 nominations on Wednesday across a slate which includes The Favourite, Cold War and Widows.

This is the first year the BFI\u2019s diversity standards have become mandatory in the best debut and best British film categories. These require films to fulfil a number of different production-stage quotas that demonstrate that they have \u201cworked to increase the representation of under-represented groups\u201d in areas including \u201conscreen representation\u201d and \u201cindustry access and opportunities\u201d. They come as part of Bafta\u2019s drive to up the diversity of its membership, as well as the breadth of films they choose to celebrate. This year\u2019s best British film nominees are Bohemian Rhapsody, The Favourite, Stan &amp; Ollie, fashion documentary McQueen, Lynne Ramsay\u2019s You Were Never Really Here, starring a vengeful Joaquin Phoenix, and serial killer thriller Beast. The latter is also up for best British debut for its writer/director Michael Pearce.

Come the Islamic Revolution of 1979, the masterplan embodied everything that the new regime stood against: it was the detestable legacy of the Shah writ large across the city.

A stretch of Valiasr Street now has a sculpture garden along one side, where a number of dead trees have been adorned with artwork to disguise the fact they\u2019re stricken due to lack of water. Bus stops have been decorated and novelty benches commissioned \u2013 but nothing has changed beneath the surface.</p> \n<p>Hakiminejad says the beautification campaign and the Sadr expressway are just two of innumerable ill-conceived schemes conducted over the last decade, along with policies that have seen the trampling of the city\u2019s little remaining green space. Over the past decade, around 4,000 hectares of Tehran\u2019s former gardens have been destroyed by the so-called \u201cgarden tower\u201d act, which allows people to build high-rises on garden land.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"72c8c83a990e5352663ada8400fecbc2201002a4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72c8c83a990e5352663ada8400fecbc2201002a4/0_254_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Families ride pedal boats in the artificial Chitgar Lake, to the north-west of Tehran.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Families ride pedal boats in the artificial Chitgar Lake, to the north-west of Tehran.

The lake has been <a href=\"https://financialtribune.com/articles/people/51238/chitgar-artificial-lake-project-flawed\">accused of diverting much-needed flows of water from the city</a>, while the surrounding plots have been sold off in the usual fashion, spawning a grim forest of high-rise towers and malls. There are few of the facilities such as schools that a functioning new urban centre needs.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s yet another \u2018wow\u2019 project, designed more as a tourist attraction than an extension of the city,\u201d says Hakiminejad. \u201cIt\u2019s going to end up being a vertical slum.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chitgar is one of a number of new satellite towns planned across the country in a bid to ease pressure on the capital. Last year the government announced it would build <a href=\"https://financialtribune.com/articles/people/72296/new-satellite-towns-unattractive-still\">11 new towns by 2041</a>, a declaration that raised eyebrows given that most of the new towns built after the 1979 revolution remain grossly under-occupied. A total of 17 satellite towns were built on the periphery of Iran\u2019s eight biggest cities in the 1980s and 90s, but most still stand as ghostly dormitories, their vacancy rates at 80%.</p> \n<p>And all the time, people keep flocking to Tehran. The Iran Urban Economics Scientific Association estimates that the city\u2019s <a href=\"https://financialtribune.com/articles/domestic-economy/59537/tehran-conditions-substandard\">population now exceeds its capacity by more than 70%</a> \u2013 meaning it can only provide 2.3 million of its 8 million residents with decent living conditions. Without wholesale reform of the planning system, real investment in public transport, and an end to the cash-for-towers culture, that statistic stands little chance of improving.</p> \n<p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardiancities/?hl=en\">Instagram</a> to join the discussion, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities\">explore our archive here</a></em></p>",

As chairman of Tehran city council\u2019s health and environment committee, Mohammad Haqqani, put it: \u201cTehran municipality is granting permits to almost all applicants wishing to construct commercial buildings like shopping malls and office buildings, without paying attention to the real needs of each district and the worsening traffic congestion in the sprawling capital.\u201d Following a spate of high-end malls, a district in northern Tehran finally banned their construction last year. But it is too little too late. Beautification is skin deep Many point the finger at Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, Iran\u2019s former chief of police and several-time failed presidential candidate, who served as the mayor of Tehran from 2005 until 2017. He presided over a wealth of impressive-looking trophy projects which introduced a glossy image of modernity \u2013 but did little to tackle the city\u2019s real problems. The expansion of the Sadr expressway was one of his most publicised achievements, seeing a three-mile long double-decker concrete highway erected in the north-east of the city. Articles on the project were greeted with comments such as \u201cLong live Tehran\u2019s master builder, the humble accomplisher, Dr Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf,\u201d and \u201cMay the eyes of the envious and extremist burst in jealousy.\u201d Those eyes are now watering at the vast expense and unintended consequences of the grand plan, which has had the effect of increasing traffic and further cementing car as king. Members of the Tehran city council conceded last year that adequate research was not conducted before construction began, and that the elevated highway has failed to achieve its main purpose. \u201cIt is a disastrous project,\u201d says architect and urbanist Ahmadreza Hakiminejad. \u201cIt was hailed as a way of reducing Tehran\u2019s congestion, but it has had the opposite result. If you make more room for cars, you get more cars on the street. More cars means more congestion and more pollution.\u201d All schools in the capital were forced to close one day last year due to the dangerous levels of toxic particles in the air. Pollution causes an annual 20,000 deaths, according to deputy health minister Alireza Raeisi, a statistic that has even prompted the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to weigh in: it is now religiously forbidden to drive vehicles in such high levels of pollution without valid rationale. Ghalibaf put his efforts into applying a thin layer of decoration across Tehran in an attempt to divert people\u2019s attention from its day-to-day dysfunction. The Bureau of Beautification was established to oversee a campaign of murals, bollard paintings and curious sculptures. A stretch of Valiasr Street now has a sculpture garden along one side, where a number of dead trees have been adorned with artwork to disguise the fact they\u2019re stricken due to lack of water. Bus stops have been decorated and novelty benches commissioned \u2013 but nothing has changed beneath the surface. Hakiminejad says the beautification campaign and the Sadr expressway are just two of innumerable ill-conceived schemes conducted over the last decade, along with policies that have seen the trampling of the city\u2019s little remaining green space. Over the past decade, around 4,000 hectares of Tehran\u2019s former gardens have been destroyed by the so-called \u201cgarden tower\u201d act, which allows people to build high-rises on garden land. Other grand visions, like the satellite development around the artificial Chitgar Lake to the north-west of Tehran, have similarly backfired. The lake has been accused of diverting much-needed flows of water from the city, while the surrounding plots have been sold off in the usual fashion, spawning a grim forest of high-rise towers and malls. There are few of the facilities such as schools that a functioning new urban centre needs. \u201cIt\u2019s yet another \u2018wow\u2019 project, designed more as a tourist attraction than an extension of the city,\u201d says Hakiminejad. \u201cIt\u2019s going to end up being a vertical slum.\u201d Chitgar is one of a number of new satellite towns planned across the country in a bid to ease pressure on the capital. Last year the government announced it would build 11 new towns by 2041, a declaration that raised eyebrows given that most of the new towns built after the 1979 revolution remain grossly under-occupied. A total of 17 satellite towns were built on the periphery of Iran\u2019s eight biggest cities in the 1980s and 90s, but most still stand as ghostly dormitories, their vacancy rates at 80%. And all the time, people keep flocking to Tehran. The Iran Urban Economics Scientific Association estimates that the city\u2019s population now exceeds its capacity by more than 70% \u2013 meaning it can only provide 2.3 million of its 8 million residents with decent living conditions. Without wholesale reform of the planning system, real investment in public transport, and an end to the cash-for-towers culture, that statistic stands little chance of improving.

She and fellow Spartacist leader Karl Liebknecht were brutally murdered in January 1919, just when their moment seemed to have come.</p> <p>Germany had surrendered, 40,000 German sailors had mutinied in Kiel and the kaiser had fled, leaving the Social Democratic Party (SPD) to take control in what they branded a revolution. But for the Spartacist League (breakaway communist members of the SPD) this wasn\u2019t enough. Germany needed to follow Russia in a full-scale transformation. The SPD had betrayed the workers by voting for war in 1914 (Liebknecht was the only Reichstag member to vote against it) and remained hamstrung by combinations of conservatism, indecision and outright panic. On 4 January the government dismissed the communist-sympathising chief of police, sparking a widespread general strike. This became violent when the government instructed the GKSD (an elite paramilitary unit) to suppress the communists, prompting the Spartacists to urge armed revolt. On 15 January the GKSD captured Luxemburg and Liebknecht in Berlin; they were dead within a few hours.</p> <p>Who killed them? At the time, the GKSD claimed that it was an angry throng. It quickly became clear that it was the GKSD who had carried out the murders, but the identity of the killers remained uncertain. In 1993 Klaus Gietinger published a book in Germany identifying the particular soldiers responsible for giving the orders and pressing the trigger. Now it has been published in English to coincide with the centenary of the murders, translated by Loren Balhorn.</p> <p>Luxemberg\u2019s killer is identified as Hermann Souchon, a GKSD officer. As Luxemburg was getting into the car transporting her to prison, Otto Runge struck her on the head with his rifle butt and Souchon then leapt on to the left footboard, placed a pistol against her left temple and shot her. She died instantly and her body was thrown into the canal by the transport officer Kurt Vogel. The murder had been ordered by Waldemar Pabst, first general staff officer of the GKSD, who claimed responsibility for the killings in a series of notorious 1960s interviews, stating that \u201ctimes of civil war have their own laws\u201d and that the Germans should thank both him and Gustav Noske, the SPD defence minister, \u201con their knees for it, build monuments to us and name streets and public squares after us!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Gietinger is less adept at exploring the significance of the murders, which he seems to think we can take as read</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>History repeats itself \u201cfirst as tragedy and then as farce\u201d, as Marx said, and Gietinger is good at bringing out the absurdity of the farce that followed the murder. There was a series of trials in which the SPD leaders colluded with the killers, appointing their collaborators as judges. In May 1919, the court decided that Runge had attempted to kill Luxemburg and Vogel had shot her, but only gave them two-year sentences as they couldn\u2019t know who\u2019d caused the death. When Vogel escaped to the Netherlands, the authorities failed to extradite him, frightened he\u2019d expose the identity of his accomplices. Shockingly, even in 1960s West Germany when Pabst revealed that he\u2019d ordered the killing, the government issued a communique labelling the double homicide a \u201clegitimate execution\u201d. At this point, Pabst outed Souchon as the killer, but Souchon took the audacious step of suing for libel. The court assigned to judge the case relied on the wholly inaccurate records from the 1919 trial, so he won. This book therefore provides an important coda to these years in proving, with the aid of diagrams and documents, that Souchon was the culprit.</p> <p>Gietinger is less adept at exploring the significance of the murders, which he seems to think we can take as read. Although there\u2019s a new preface, Verso haven\u2019t thought through how to make the book relevant to British readers or to 2019, sidestepping the important question of what her death might mean to us now. Gietinger tells us that these killings were \u201cone of the great tragedies of the twentieth century\u201d. But why? What could Luxemburg and Liebknecht have achieved had they been allowed to live?</p> <p>In 1919, the revolution they dreamed of doesn\u2019t appear to have been as imminent as the SPD feared. For one thing, the Spartacist leaders were divided on how to bring it about. Luxemburg still favoured parliamentary democracy, wanting to participate in elections and win majority support, while Liebknecht favoured direct action, wishing to take to the streets. They didn\u2019t have a clear model to follow. She thought that the revolution in Russia was flawed by Lenin\u2019s centralising of power and suppression of the opposition. \u201cFreedom for supporters of the government only, for members of one party only \u2026 is no freedom at all,\u201d she wrote in <em>The Russian Revolution</em> in 1918. She saw Lenin and Trotsky as mistaken in thinking that socialist transformation could follow a \u201cready-made formula\u201d when in fact the formula for economic, social and juridical change lay \u201chidden in the mists of the future\u201d. If Germany was going to emulate Russia, if communism was going to be the international phenomenon she believed it had to be, it was going to take time, and the general strike in Germany could only be a tentative first step.</p> <p>Would the Spartacists have given her this time, even if the SPD had been prepared to do so? It seems unlikely. Nonetheless, Gietinger is right to call their deaths a tragedy. This was a moment when the \u201cSozial\u201d in the SPD name meant something, in a way that the \u201csozialismus\u201d in National Socialism did not. Many of the key players in the Luxemburg murder went on to become allies of Hitler, who described Noske as \u201can oak among these Social Democrat plants\u201d. But in a more mixed political setting, their nationalist and authoritarian tendencies might have been restrained and their socialist tendencies given greater ascendancy. What if Germany had splintered apart into its former states, allowing a selection of political systems to jostle against each other? What if the allies had been less harsh in their peace terms? What if the vision of an internationalist world ushered into being by the League of Nations had been more compelling? What if Luxemburg had returned to Russia, the land of her birth, and tried to influence events there?</p> <p>It\u2019s easy still to feel Luxemburg\u2019s presence as a spectre haunting Europe. There are many alternative worlds where she could have made a difference, with her combination of charisma, articulacy and logic, her willingness to learn from the past and remain optimistic about the future, her dual commitment to the local and the international. Gietinger writes that when the SPD sank Luxemburg\u2019s body in the Landwehr Canal, they were \u201csinking the Weimar Republic along with it\u201d. He doesn\u2019t explain why this is the case, but this is one of several moments of mourning in this book \u2013 welcome intrusions in the forensic scrupulousness. And certainly, alongside Luxemburg, we can mourn a world in which the radical left had a role to play in democratic government and in which internationalist, pacifist principles remained more important than national self-determination.</p> <p><em>Lara Feigel\u2019s Free Woman: Life, Liberation and Doris Lessing is published by Bloomsbury. </em></p>",

The video and blurb on its website are clear that, within an hour of reporting a broadband outage, it will send a 4G Mini Hub and turn on unlimited data on any BT mobile phones associated with the account. I have experienced two half-day outages and both times BT pointed to the small print which allows it to get out of its promise if the outage is down to \u201cplanned or unplanned outages\u201d on its network. I feel its marketing is highly misleading and it is taking money for a service it doesn\u2019t provide. MR, London BT\u2019s sales pitch appears unambiguous. It promises: \u201cIn the unlikely event there\u2019s a problem with your broadband and you report a fault, we\u2019ll send you a Mini Hub straightaway, which uses a mobile signal to help your devices go online at no extra cost. If you\u2019ve got mobile with us, within an hour of reporting the fault, we\u2019ll switch on free unlimited data on all your phones so you can stay connected.\u201d Only in the terms and conditions (which you have to cut and paste into the browser since there\u2019s no link on the web page) are \u201cqualifying\u201d faults mentioned. And you have to read more than half way through to clause 10e to discover that \u201cplanned or unplanned outages on BT\u2019s network or any third party service\u201d disqualify you from the promise in the \u00a365.99-a-month Plus deal. Faults in the \u201chome environment\u201d such as wiring issues are also excluded which means a significant proportion of causes aren\u2019t covered. These crucial caveats should be made clear at the outset, in the same way that insurers highlight essential terms in key facts documents. BT missed the point when it told me: \u2018There are some scenarios where sending a 4G Mini Hub might not be possible or the best way to get back online, for example if the fault is likely to be repaired in a few hours, or in the rare event there are broader issues affecting broadband and mobile networks in a specific area.\u201d When I pressed the issue it did not respond. This is something customers should report to the Advertising Standards Authority which did not respond to my request for a comment.

But the sandbags and rifle-toting troops that now encircle the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas suggest far less confidence about the days ahead, as Venezuela sinks deeper into economic ruin and political isolation and questions grow over Maduro\u2019s future. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s 56-year-old heir \u2013 narrowly elected after his mentor\u2019s 2013 death and then again in disputed elections last May \u2013 will begin his second presidential term on Thursday, amid intensifying international condemnation of what critics call his illegitimate and authoritarian rule. Last week, a regional bloc known as the Lima Group turned up the heat, with 13 of its 14 members announcing they would not recognise Maduro\u2019s new six-year term and urging him to step down. Those countries included Brazil, whose new far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, is well-known for his hostility to Maduro and whose pro-Trump foreign minister recently called for Venezuela\u2019s \u201cliberation\u201d. The US has also stepped up pressure ahead of what it calls Maduro\u2019s \u201csham inauguration\u201d with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, telling one Brazilian newspaper \u201cseveral things\u201d could be done to rid Venezuela of Maduro\u2019s \u201cunacceptable\u201d regime. Pompeo did not specify what those \u201cthings\u201d might be but the remark echoed Donald Trump\u2019s thinly veiled threat that military action was possible if Maduro did not go voluntarily. Despite the rhetorical war \u2013 Maduro recently ordered his troops to prepare to rip out the hearts of \u201cimperialist\u201d invaders \u2013 observers still consider a foreign military intervention unlikely. \u201cI don\u2019t see boots on the ground,\u201d said Matias Spektor, an international relations specialist from Brazil\u2019s Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation. But after years of dawdling, regional patience does appear to be running out, as the situation in Venezuela deteriorates and Latin American politics swerves to the right under leaders such as Bolsonaro, Colombia\u2019s Iv\u00e1n Duque, Chile\u2019s Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era and Argentina\u2019s Mauricio Macri. \u201cThe dynamics are changing and they are changing very fast,\u201d said Spektor, calling the rise of those politicians decidedly bad news for Maduro. Spektor said the Lima Group\u2019s unexpectedly firm declaration \u2013 which includes plans for financial sanctions, preventing top Venezuela officials entering their countries, and suspending military cooperation \u2013 appeared partly designed to persuade the Venezuelan military to abandon their commander-in-chief. \u201cFor the regime to collapse you need to get Maduro out of the country and you need to get the military to stop supporting the regime \u2026 The way you do that is by sending signals to the military that in the long run if they stick to Maduro and the regime they will lose power,\u201d he said. Latin American governments did not want regime change imposed by outsiders \u201cbecause they know full well it would backfire \u2013 but they do want to see regime change via peaceful means\u201d. Under its new leftist president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, Mexico has resisted joining the anti-Maduro offensive, a move decried by human rights activists and Venezuela\u2019s opposition. \u201cI don\u2019t stick my nose into other countries\u2019 affairs,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said last week, emphasizing Mexico\u2019s return to a foreign policy of non-intervention. But most Latin American countries are moving in the opposite direction, leaving Maduro increasingly friendless in a region his Bolivarian predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, dreamed of uniting during the \u201cpink tide\u201d era of leftist rule. Brazil, in particular, looks poised to play a frontline role in the diplomatic push to force Venezuela\u2019s president out. \u201cIn the early days of the administration, my understanding is that people in the Bolsonaro government want to send a very clear and unequivocal signal that Maduro\u2019s costs in the region are about to go up,\u201d said Spektor. Brazil\u2019s foreign minister, Ernesto Ara\u00fajo, hinted at that harder line this week arguing: \u201cYou have to face the threats, and the main one comes from non-democratic regimes that export crime, instability and oppression. You can\u2019t simply wish away dictatorships such as Venezuela and Cuba.\u201d Bolsonaro\u2019s politician son, Eduardo, tweeted: \u201cThe noose is tightening around Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\u201d David Smilde, a Venezuela expert from the Washington Office on Latin America advocacy group, said there was a growing sense that with the end of Maduro\u2019s first term and growing regional pressure the crisis was entering a new phase: \u201cBut nobody really knows just exactly what it amounts to. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say: \u2018You\u2019re illegitimate\u2019. But how much does that mean in the end? It doesn\u2019t look like any of the Lima Group members or the United States are going to close up their embassies or break off diplomatic relations,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want Venezuela to return to democracy in some way \u2026 [and to stop] the mass exodus of Venezuelans \u2026 but I don\u2019t think they really have much of an idea how to do that.\u201d Maduro and his inner circle would be fretting over their increasing isolation \u201cand that\u2019s why you see them reaching out to the Russians and the Chinese continually\u201d, Smilde said. But any international effort to engineer a peaceful transition would founder unless Venezuela\u2019s fractured opposition united. \u201cUntil that happens, the government can kind of do whatever it wants \u2013 even a weak government can consolidate if it has no opposition.\u201d",

Niall Blair\u2019s office said on Wednesday that security concerns following threats on social media meant he did not stop at a boat ramp where about 150 residents had gathered during a visit to the far-western community of Menindee. The group had travelled from locations including Broken Hill and the town of Louth, three-and-a-half hours from Menindee, and had waited to speak to Blair about the government\u2019s management of water flows into the system and how it intends to deal with what communities have called an environmental disaster. A spokeswoman for the minister said they were acting on advice from police and other government agencies and instead stopped further upstream, where Blair spoke with a group of about 15 Menindee residents for about 40 minutes. Darryn Clifton, a Broken Hill resident and the secretary of the Broken Hill and Darling River Action Group, said the larger group watched as Blair passed by on a boat inspecting the river.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m standing on a bridge, taking in the panorama of the Plaza de Espa\u00f1a in Seville. I\u2019m in this spot because a month ago I received a cryptic postcard from a stranger instructing me to travel to the Spanish city. I\u2019m not a kooky assassin who receives her assignments via postcard like Villanelle in Killing Eve, it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve signed up to new subscription travel service BRB, which every four months sends its customers on a city break to a surprise destination. Hoping to appeal to a generation that listens to music via Spotify, watches films and TV on Netflix and probably has at least one gym membership they\u2019ve forgotten about, subscribers to BRB pay a monthly fee (\u00a349.99 for a solo traveller and \u00a389 for two people) to unlock a three-day, two-night city break every four months. So for those travelling solo it works out as \u00a3199.96 a trip, which includes a minimum of three-star accommodation, Atol-protection and the ability to select your preferred travel dates and departure airport. It is also possible to exclude destinations from your \u201cbucket list\u201d, so I when I sign up, I veto Berlin and Amsterdam, as I\u2019ve visited both recently. It\u2019s exciting scrolling through the 48 remaining options and wondering where I\u2019ll end up. I can\u2019t help crossing my fingers that I get one of the warmer destinations \u2013 Athens or Positano, as opposed to Ljubljana or Tallinn \u2013 but not knowing is part of the fun. \u201cThe way we travel has changed massively in the last five years but the way we book that travel is still fairly long-winded and time consuming,\u201d says Greg Geny, co-founder and CEO of BRB, which launched last August. \u201cWe want to cut the time of trawling through Skyscanner, Booking.com or Airbnb and also help people discover new places.\u201d If you\u2019re a control freak, the stress of not having a say in where you\u2019re holidaying might require a holiday to get over it, but clearly enough travellers are looking for the element of surprise. Pinterest reports that searches for surprise trips went up 192% from 2017 to 2018. From high-end luxury travel company Black Tomato\u2019s Get Lost trips, to sprs.me\u2019s more budget offerings, visiting a destination unknown is a trend. And if the Russian roulette of whether you\u2019ll get your hand luggage on to your budget airline isn\u2019t enough excitement, the easyJet app incorporates a Lucky Trip widget that generates a random destination and corresponding flights at the tap of a button. As you\u2019d expect of a company that takes its name from textspeak (BRB means Be Right Back), the process is full of cringe-inducing wording \u2013 I can indicate whether I\u2019d prefer a trip that\u2019s \u201c4TheGram\u201d or \u201cQuirkyAF\u201d (Quirky As Fuck). But cynicism aside, when I receive my postcard in a bright red envelope I feel a genuine flutter of excitement, and I\u2019m chuffed to discover I\u2019ve \u2018\u201cwon\u201d Seville, as it\u2019s a city I\u2019ve never been to. Not to mention the fact the weather forecast is for 22C. A couple of days later I log in to my BRB account to discover my flight times, which is when I see the downside to this way of holidaying. I\u2019d opted for a morning flight but if I\u2019d been booking it myself I probably wouldn\u2019t have chosen an eye-watering 06.25 departure from Gatwick. I then Google where I\u2019ll be staying: The H10 Corregidor Boutique Hotel. It has an amazing location right in the centre of the city, and has breakfast included, but as part of the Spanish chain hotel looks slightly uninspiring. Once the trip has been revealed, BRB emails over a PDF city guide to the destination. It\u2019s a letdown that this \u201ccheat sheet\u201d hasn\u2019t been better researched.

He told primetime viewers: \u201cThis barrier is absolutely critical to border security.

      "bodyText": "Top story: President declines to invoke emergency in TV address Good morning \u2013 Warren Murray with the news summary that you can slip into like a comfortable pair of shoes. Donald Trump was immediately rebuked by Democrats overnight after he went on national television appealing to Congress to fund his Mexico wall in return for ending the government shutdown. The president did not offer fresh ideas to break the current political impasse and did not declare a national emergency so that he could bypass Congress, as had been speculated. In a string of dubious claims, Trump blamed criminal gangs and \u201cvast quantities of illegal drugs\u201d for \u201cthousands of deaths\u201d and faulted Democrats for failing to end the shutdown, now in its 18th day. He told primetime viewers: \u201cThis barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It\u2019s also what our professionals at the border want and need \u2026 The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.\u201d (Fact-checkers have scorned Trump\u2019s assertion that the post-Nafta deal means Mexico would somehow bear the cost.) \u201cThis situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting,\u201d the president said. \u201cI have invited congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done.\u201d The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, delivered a live rebuttal. \u201cSadly, much of what we have heard from President Trump throughout this senseless shutdown has been full of misinformation and even malice,\u201d Pelosi said. Delivering the soundbite of the day, Schumer added: \u201cWe don\u2019t govern by temper tantrum. No president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down, hurting millions of Americans who are treated as leverage.\u201d Guardian US columnist Richard Wolffe characterises it as Trump staring himself down in the mirror and losing \u2013 \u201cThis is a very real crisis inside one man\u2019s cranium and it\u2019s playing out in the living rooms of a weary nation.\u201d * * * MPs deal blow to May \u2013 In the House of Commons a cross-party alliance has set up a shutdown of sorts, by curbing the government\u2019s powers to spend money on a no-deal Brexit. Their amendment means new tax administration measures will only be allowed to come into force if there is a deal, a decision to extend article 50, or a vote in the Commons specifically approving a no-deal Brexit. The successful passage of the amendment with Labour\u2019s backing has galvanised opponents of a hard Brexit: \u201cWe will not allow a no-deal exit to occur at the end of March,\u201d said Conservative former staunch loyalist Sir Oliver Letwin. May has conceded to senior ministers that she is on course to lose next week\u2019s historic Brexit vote. At a cabinet meeting, Michael Gove was said to have likened MPs holding out for a better deal to \u201cmid-50s swingers\u201d wishing Scarlett Johansson would turn up to one of their parties (felt a bit nauseated typing that). This morning, political correspondent Jess Elgot answers key questions on how things play out from here; while our editorial says it is clear the government has failed on Brexit and advocates taking it back to the people. * * * Midweek catch-up \u2013 The first one of 2019, not counting that new year catch-up last Thursday \u2026 &gt; Flights at Heathrow were halted between 5-6pm yesterday when a drone was sighted over the airfield. The military was called in to provide protection and police have opened a criminal investigation. &gt; Protesters who have been harassing and abusing MPs outside parliament have put away their yellow vests because \u201cthe police are after all of us\u201d. Facebook has deleted the page of James Goddard, the group\u2019s most prominent member, for spreading hate speech. &gt; The largest opposition party in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has claimed its leader is the \u201cpresumed\u201d winner of the 30 December presidential election. Electoral authorities missed a deadline of last Sunday to release the result. &gt; Kate Bush has announced that despite praising Theresa May in an interview, she is not a Conservative supporter. The musician said she liked having a woman in power and had disliked David Cameron. * * * Hand of Moscow \u2013 In the Trump-Russia investigation, Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort allegedly shared polling data on the 2016 election with a Russian contact of Moscow\u2019s intelligence agencies. And a mystery foreign government-owned company is paying a daily US$50,000 fine for refusing to comply with a subpoena that may be linked to Russia\u2019s interference in the election. Court proceedings surrounding the matter are being kept under wraps. * * * Paradise Papers journalist jailed \u2013 Pelin \u00dcnker, a journalist in Turkey, has been given more than a year\u2019s jail for \u201cdefamation and insult\u201d over her Paradise Papers reporting, which detailed the Maltese business activities of the country\u2019s now-former prime minister Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and his sons. \u00dcnker has told the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) she intends to appeal, pointing out that the Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m family admitted articles about their Maltese businesses were accurate. Turkey has the world\u2019s worst record for jailing journalists, with 68 in prison at the end of 2018. The ICIJ\u2019s director, Gerard Ryle, condemned \u00dcnker\u2019s jailing as \u201cthe latest assault on journalistic freedom under President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s autocratic rule\u201d. * * * Vote leaf, vote romaine \u2013 Here\u2019s a lovely \u201cand finally\u201d piece \u2026 how to grow your own veg even if you don\u2019t have the space. \u201cMicrogreens are ideal,\u201d writes Alys Fowler. \u201cThese are the first flush of a seedling\u2019s leaves and are harvested at about 5-10cm tall.\u201d Raid the bin for takeaway containers that will fit on the windowsill; poke holes in the bottom for drainage and use the lid to catch it. Nearly fill the tray with peat-free compost, sow your seeds 1cm apart, water them in, and you can usually start harvesting a week or two later, Fowler writes. \u201cLettuce, herbs such as basil, mint, coriander and parsley, peas, celery, chard, any cabbage, watercress, mustards, rocket, chives, radishes and spinach are all ideal.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: Where next for Brexit? As Theresa May prepares for the showdown Brexit vote on Tuesday, the government is stepping up its contingency planning for crashing out of the EU without a deal. The Guardian\u2019s Patrick Wintour sets out the routes available to the government as the exit date fast approaches.

As of Wednesday afternoon it had raised more than $160,000 and set a new target of amassing 10,000 donors. According to figures from the WA department of corrective services, as of Wednesday there were only four people \u2013 two men and two women \u2013 in custody solely for non-payment of fines.

A spokeswoman for the attorney general, John Quigley, said that legislation to change the law would be put before parliament by the middle of the year. She said the government took the issue \u201cvery seriously\u201d. \u201cThe attorney general is committed to ensuring the quality and content of the statute book and he will introduce this comprehensive package of reforms as soon as possible,\u201d she said. Quigley has also flagged plans to garnish the Centrelink payments or wages of people who do not pay their fines, a proposal that Kilroy said would further punish those too poor to pay.",

The Hargreaves Lansdown Wealth 150 list of funds is regarded as the most powerful buy-list in the asset management industry, driving huge flows in and out of fund firms. Hargreaves has catapulted itself into the FTSE 100 of Britain\u2019s biggest companies, with 1.1 million clients investing nearly \u00a3100bn through the company\u2019s fund selections. In an overhaul of its approach to fund recommendations, Hargreaves has decided to replace the Wealth 150 list with a new list called the Wealth 50, although initially it will have closer to 60 funds. The biggest surprise has been the continuing inclusion of Woodford Equity Income, run by Woodford. Woodford became the darling of the investment industry, enjoying stellar performance at Invesco Perpetual before opening his own company in 2014. But while the performance of his new fund was initially strong, it has since lagged badly, giving investors a -8% return over the last three years. Meanwhile, the baton of Britain\u2019s No 1 manager has passed to Smith, whose Fundsmith Equity fund has given investors a gain of 66% over the last three years. Billions of pounds have poured into Smith\u2019s coffers, with the fund now the largest in the UK at about \u00a316bn. Yet Hargreaves Lansdown has decided not to put Fundsmith Equity on its Wealth 50 buy-list. Hargreaves regularly obtains discounts from fund management groups when it includes their funds on its buy-list, which it passes on to clients. But this has opened it to accusations that if managers such as Smith refuse to offer a discount, then Hargreaves will not recommend the fund.

This has led to a surge of online multimedia campaigns and interactive games on social issues.

Viewers are invited to step into Katya\u2019s shoes and are confronted with her life choices. It\u2019s been an instant success, attracting up to 800,000 views in just a few months. Starring well-known young Russian actors, and with accessible dialogue and a slick production, the film reaches more people than a single NGO ever could.</p> <p>This matters immensely in a country where the government has failed to cope with one of the fastest\u2011growing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/29/stigma-means-russia-risks-hiv-epidemic-as-cases-rise\" title=\"\">HIV epidemics</a> in the world. Stigmatisation and ignorance are catastrophic. Local support groups are under growing pressure. They suffer from smear campaigns, funding cuts and being disconnected from international partners.

They\u2019re filling a vacuum created by the growing rift between the government and ordinary Russians. In a recent study, 94% of Russians said they <a href=\"https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3766277\" title=\"\">no longer rely on the state</a> to solve their problems. That amounts to a breakdown of the \u201csocial contract\u201d on which Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime has long relied.

      "bodyText": "An exciting wave of innovative activism is emerging across the former Soviet Union. I work for an organisation that supports civic activists and I see a new energy, self-belief and creativity that defies the pessimism permeating western debates about civil society in the region. What\u2019s refreshing about these Generation Z activists is that they\u2019ve linked up with designers, tech experts and artists to test new forms of advocacy, campaigning and storytelling. This has led to a surge of online multimedia campaigns and interactive games on social issues. Some have used chatbots to offer instant support to victims of human rights abuses. In Russia, an experimental interactive online film launched by the independent news outlet Takie Dela tells the story of Katya, a young Russian girl living with the stigma of HIV. Viewers are invited to step into Katya\u2019s shoes and are confronted with her life choices. It\u2019s been an instant success, attracting up to 800,000 views in just a few months. Starring well-known young Russian actors, and with accessible dialogue and a slick production, the film reaches more people than a single NGO ever could. This matters immensely in a country where the government has failed to cope with one of the fastest\u2011growing HIV epidemics in the world. Stigmatisation and ignorance are catastrophic. Local support groups are under growing pressure. They suffer from smear campaigns, funding cuts and being disconnected from international partners. Since the introduction of a law targeting NGOs as \u201cforeign agents\u201d, finding new ways to act is crucial. In December, yet another local HIV prevention NGO was forced to close, bringing yet more proof of why projects like Vsyo Slozhno have taken on a new importance. It isn\u2019t just technology to which these new activists are turning. They\u2019re filling a vacuum created by the growing rift between the government and ordinary Russians. In a recent study, 94% of Russians said they no longer rely on the state to solve their problems. That amounts to a breakdown of the \u201csocial contract\u201d on which Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime has long relied. It also gives Generation Z groups a chance to expand. Takie Dela is a frontrunner, combining in-depth journalism with direct support for charities working on issues it writes about. Last year it attracted 250,000 online donations. Other recent fundraising campaigns launched by Transparency International Moscow, as well as the independent Novoe Vremie (New Times) newspaper, which had been slapped with court fines, have also been successful \u2013 surely a sign of a new willingness among Russians to defend and support independent civil society. And it\u2019s particularly encouraging to see this apply to \u201charder\u201d human rights issues such as prison conditions and torture. Studies show Russians no longer list \u201cstrong government\u201d but \u201cjustice\u201d as their primary demand, and rights groups are beginning to respond to this shift.

And as we head towards the European parliament elections in May, any thoughts of ardently pro-European pre-crisis Italy now seem unreal.</p> <p>Populism has spread across the west, and in Italy the current revolt resembles a love affair turned sour. The French and the Germans, who arguably have a less sentimental approach to the EU, struggle to understand our state of mind. We were once truly in love with Brussels. Our opinion-makers were inspired by the exalted faith in Europe shown by the likes of Giuseppe Mazzini (one of the prime movers of Italy\u2019s 19th\u2011century unification), Altiero Spinelli (an advocate of European federalism) or Alcide De Gasperi (a founding father of the common market in the 1950s). We thought this dream could give Italy a fresh start. In particular middle-class Italians were convinced that, unlike their national institutions, the EU would deliver stability, justice, fairness and an end to corruption. I doubt that we have ever loved our own state as much as we loved the EU.</p> <p>Those who grew up in Italy in the 1970s will remember feeling inferior and locked up in a country doomed to be on the sidelines. In France, Germany and the UK, postwar politics allowed a reasonably healthy democratic life. In Italy, our longing for democracy was thwarted. We had the most powerful Communist party in western Europe. We had neo\u2011fascist violence and the Red Brigades. If we wanted to see Bob Dylan or the Rolling Stones perform live we had to take the train to Zurich or Munich. Even rock stars were too frightened to venture here.</p> <p>In the 1980s and 90s, with the end of terror attacks, optimism surged, the economy recovered and Italians felt they could once more relate to the rest of the world.

The EU gradually fell out of favour, no longer a lover full of promise after which we feverishly raced \u2013 rather, a strict, demanding stepmother, a mask many saw as concealing an austerity-obsessed Germany. Once a source of stimulus, the EU became a scapegoat. Whatever the bitter pills being meted out \u2013 higher taxes, lower public spending, or accommodating hundreds of thousands of migrants from across the Mediterranean \u2013 the complaint dredged up was always the same: Europe is making demands.</p> <p>The catalyst for this sea-change in public opinion was the 2008 financial crisis. After Greece, Italy was probably the country hardest hit by the recession. Admittedly, successive governments (under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/16/mario-monti-cabinet-members\" title=\"\">Mario Monti</a>, then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/12/italian-pm-enrico-letta-government-danger-collapse\" title=\"\">Enrico Letta</a>) managed to balance the books again, but this couldn\u2019t dispel a feeling shared by many voters that they had been taken for a ride.</p> <p>It sometimes feels like we\u2019ve taken leave of our senses. The political culture of the Five Star Movement in the coalition is rooted in its late co-founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/03/italy-five-star-movement-internet\" title=\"\">Gianroberto Casaleggio</a>\u2019s obsessions with impending doom, as well as the craziness of the former comedian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/30/beppe-grillo-comedian-italy-five-star\" title=\"\">Beppe Grillo</a>.

We\u2019d enjoy the luxury of driving from Milan to Nice, for lunch on the Promenade des Anglais, without even needing to show our ID cards. But in recent years Italy has switched from being determined not to \u201cmiss the bus\u201d to a sense of weariness; that \u201cEurope keeps demanding things from us\u201d. The EU gradually fell out of favour, no longer a lover full of promise after which we feverishly raced \u2013 rather, a strict, demanding stepmother, a mask many saw as concealing an austerity-obsessed Germany. Once a source of stimulus, the EU became a scapegoat. Whatever the bitter pills being meted out \u2013 higher taxes, lower public spending, or accommodating hundreds of thousands of migrants from across the Mediterranean \u2013 the complaint dredged up was always the same: Europe is making demands. The catalyst for this sea-change in public opinion was the 2008 financial crisis. After Greece, Italy was probably the country hardest hit by the recession. Admittedly, successive governments (under Mario Monti, then Enrico Letta) managed to balance the books again, but this couldn\u2019t dispel a feeling shared by many voters that they had been taken for a ride. It sometimes feels like we\u2019ve taken leave of our senses. The political culture of the Five Star Movement in the coalition is rooted in its late co-founder Gianroberto Casaleggio\u2019s obsessions with impending doom, as well as the craziness of the former comedian Beppe Grillo. Many of the latter\u2019s disciples, now in power, have campaigned against vaccination, and even cast doubt on the moon landings. Conspiracy theories have spread to the Palazzo Chigi, the seat of Italian government. Brexit took hold in a country that never fully accepted the idea of European integration \u2013 but Italy stood enthusiastically at the heart of this project, perhaps the only place where a Brussels technocrat was ever seen as desirable. Our current predicament surely highlights the scale of disaffection towards elites. In France, Emmanuel Macron, who hoped to kickstart European integration, would do well to heed this warning. Matteo Renzi, in his brief time as prime minister, was just as energetic, yet the wave that submerged him in 2016 is still rising. \u2022 Stefano Montefiori is the Paris correspondent of Corriere della Sera",

      "body": "<p>Addiction was once viewed as an unsavoury fringe disease, tethered to substances with killer withdrawal symptoms, such as alcohol and opium. But now the scope of what humans can be addicted to seems to have snowballed, from sugar to shopping to social media. The UK\u2019s first NHS internet-addiction clinic is opening this year; the World Health Organization (WHO) has included gaming disorder in its official addictions diagnosis guidelines.</p> <p>The first glimmer of this shift was in 1992, when tabloids reported that Michael Douglas \u2013 Hollywood royalty, fresh from starring in the erotic thriller Basic Instinct \u2013 was holed up in an Arizonan rehab facility with sex addiction. No matter that, to this day, Douglas stringently denies ever suffering from the condition \u2013 the way we perceive addiction had begun to unfurl.</p> <p>Back then, the broadening of the term was often viewed in medical circles as lazy appropriation; however, neuroscience has now largely accepted that it is the same brain chemical, dopamine, driving these irrepressible cravings. What\u2019s more, our 21st-century world is so heavily baited with cues and stimuli \u2013 from stealthy marketing to junk food, not to mention the nagging lure of online life \u2013 that it appears to be rigging our dopamine systems to become \u201chypersensitised\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0aaac50976be43835fb90fcb88d876fbf809d3b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0aaac50976be43835fb90fcb88d876fbf809d3b5/0_210_5040_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gaming disorder is now included in the WHO official addictions diagnosis guidelines.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gaming disorder is now included in the WHO official addictions diagnosis guidelines.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carol Yepes/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe range of what people are getting addicted to has increased,\u201d confirms Michael Lynskey, a professor of addiction at King\u2019s College London. \u201cFor my parents\u2019 generation, the only options were tobacco and alcohol. Now there are more drugs, including synthetics, along with commercialisation and ways \u2013 especially online \u2013 of encouraging prolonged use of different things.\u201d</p> <p>Many of these emerging conditions are seen as behavioural rather than physical, substance-related addictions \u2013 but the consequences can be as grave. Gambling is the longest established behavioural addiction, having been medically recognised since 2013. Suicide rates, along with the likelihood of substance addiction, are higher among compulsive gamblers. \u201cI see gambling students who drop out of university because they can\u2019t stop,\u201d says Henrietta Bowden-Jones, the consultant psychiatrist behind the forthcoming NHS internet-addiction clinic. \u201cI see people with shopping compulsions who are in so much debt because they couldn\u2019t stop themselves from buying three dresses in different sizes, that in the end their businesses and families suffer.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes, she says, compulsions flit between different vices \u2013 for example, a young man seeking refuge from family problems might toggle between gaming and porn. \u201cI saw [a gaming disorder patient] yesterday,\u201d she adds, \u201cwho then went on to spending money on objects and clothes. You can somehow shift the behaviour but it\u2019s an illness we don\u2019t yet know enough about.\u201d</p> <p>It is hard to overlook, however, the fact that many of these thrills are available at the touch of a screen. When the addiction charity Addaction commissioned <a href=\"https://www.addaction.org.uk/sites/default/files/public/attachments/results_for_addaction_parents_survey_41_12.10.2018.xlsx\" title=\"\">a YouGov survey in October 2018</a>, it found that parents are twice as worried about their teenage children being addicted to social media as they are about drugs, and a similar ratio when comparing worries about gaming and drugs. Also in October, the EU announced it would fund the European Problematic Use of the Internet Research Network to investigate the public health implications.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47644c0c25bbf3c115466d3e0ec0657ebe00ddb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47644c0c25bbf3c115466d3e0ec0657ebe00ddb2/0_0_4784_2870/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man uses a fixed odds roulette machine \u2013 gambling is the longest established behavioural addiction.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man uses a fixed odds roulette machine \u2013 gambling is the longest established behavioural addiction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not everyone agrees with defining these new disorders as addictions \u2013 after all, you can\u2019t overdose on them. Gambling and gaming are the only ones to have made it on to the WHO list of addictions. However, a paradigm shift in understanding addiction is in motion.</p> <p>Take sex addiction. Seeking treatment for this controversial condition has, in cases such as that of the golfer Tiger Woods, been criticised as a cynical shortcut to redemption for philanderers. On the other hand, neuroscientists who have been able to study the brains of people with debilitatingly compulsive obsessions with sex <a href=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/brain-activity-in-sex-addiction-mirrors-that-of-drug-addiction\" title=\"\">witness similar responses</a> to those they have observed in drug addiction cases.</p> <p>Most of the standard criteria for addiction diagnosis do apply to these disorders, says Lynskey: \u201cTolerance, neglect of responsibilities, inability to stop, withdrawal.\u201d Withdrawal is the obvious sticking point, although sugar withdrawal symptoms have been induced in lab rats \u2013 sweats, shakes, changes in body temperature, anxiety, the whole kaboodle. \u201cIf a teenager becomes irritable when a gaming session is cut short, there\u2019s some discussion as to whether that\u2019s a sort of mild withdrawal,\u201d says Lynskey.</p> <p>Terry Robinson, an esteemed professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Michigan \u2013 together with his colleague, Kent Berridge \u2013 identified dopamine as the neurochemical responsible for craving. He thinks debating the semantics of addiction is unhelpful. \u201cWhether it\u2019s drugs, sex, gambling or whatever, you\u2019re looking at impulse-control disorders where people have difficulty refraining from maladaptive use. There are certainly similarities in terms of the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms involved.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"528fc0ca1b2dfcf4631c57c46833bf5c0d9cbf62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/528fc0ca1b2dfcf4631c57c46833bf5c0d9cbf62/367_185_2830_1938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The modern environment is stuffed with craving-inducing stimuli.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The modern environment is stuffed with craving-inducing stimuli.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once Robinson and Berridge had identified dopamine as \u201cwanting\u201d and pleasurable brain opiates as \u201cliking\u201d \u2013 two distinct phenomena \u2013 they discovered that you don\u2019t have to like something in order to want it: a key finding about addiction. In addicts\u2019 brains, the craving is unbearable even when they no longer like the object of their desire. Berridge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/feb/11/why-do-i-crave-certain-foods-research\" title=\"\">once told me</a> that the \u201cmassive\u201d, \u201crobust\u201d wanting systems in the brain can be turned on with or without pleasure, whereas pleasure \u201chas a much smaller and more fragile brain basis \u2026 That\u2019s why life\u2019s intense pleasures are less frequent and less sustained than life\u2019s intense desires\u201d. It also explains, perhaps, why humans are so easily herded into wanting new stuff and instant gratification, even when these things don\u2019t make us happy.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in these addictions,\u201d says Robinson, \u201cis that the dopamine system is becoming hypersensitised, leading to these pathological motivational states.\u201d He has identified three factors that could help explain why \u201cthere seems to be a wider variety of problematic things [to get addicted to]\u201d. (He does caution, however, that \u201cgetting into social factors is very difficult in terms of proving cause and effect\u201d.)</p> <p>The first factor is that our modern environment is stuffed with craving-inducing stimuli. \u201cPeople don\u2019t appreciate the power of cues that have been associated with rewards, be it a drug or sex or food, in generating motivational states.\u201d In fact, addicts can start liking the cues more than the end goal, such as the rigmarole of scoring drugs and so on. \u201cThe amount of cues associated with highly palatable foods are everywhere now,\u201d he says. \u201cDrugs, sex and gambling as well, and that has changed quite a bit over the years and could be leading to more problematic use.\u201d</p> <p>Lynskey agrees, adding \u201csome of the marketing and design of gambling machines is a step ahead of all of us academics in devising ways to attract users and boost dopamine and retain them\u201d. The \u201clike\u201d button, quantifying approval and igniting a compulsion to check social media, is a similar example. Introducing a report into the effects of social media on young people in early 2018, the UK\u2019s children\u2019s commissioner Anne Longfield <a href=\"https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/2018/01/04/children-unprepared-for-social-media-cliff-edge-as-they-start-secondary-school-childrens-commissioner-for-england-warns-in-new-report/\" title=\"\">wrote that</a> \u201csome children are becoming almost addicted to \u2018likes\u2019 as a form of social validation\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7f35dbbd8a5feca76f57a83caf619ded8c0e6d0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f35dbbd8a5feca76f57a83caf619ded8c0e6d0d/0_293_6016_3608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parents are twice as worried about their teenage children being addicted to social media as they are about drugs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parents are twice as worried about their teenage children being addicted to social media as they are about drugs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: golero/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Robinson\u2019s second consideration is dosage. Our liking of sweet tastes suited us when we were hunter-gatherers, helping us choose ripe energy sources. Now, we have high-fructose corn syrup, which blows our minds with unnatural levels of glucose. Similarly with drugs, he points out: \u201cChewing coca leaves in the Andes is not the same as smoking crack cocaine. The pharmacology is different and this can also increase propensity to addiction.\u201d</p> <p>His final factor is simply access. \u201cFood, sex, gambling and drugs \u2013 availability these days is much greater than it was in the past.\u201d (Sex addiction can include consuming porn, sexting, compulsive masturbation, exhibitionism and chemsex.)</p> <p>All these factors, Robinson continues, \u201ccombine in complex ways \u2013 and I\u2019m sure we don\u2019t understand them all \u2013 to increase the probability of problematic use in a variety of things\u201d. Does this mean that more people are at risk in this era of throbbing dopamine excitation? Major risk factors for addiction, such as deprivation and childhood trauma, are still important predictors for how easily your dopamine system can be hijacked, says Robinson \u2013 \u201cbut you have laden on top of that ubiquitous cues, more potent formulations and increased availability\u201d.</p> <p>Another theory about what is driving the diversification of addictive behaviours stems from a series of experiments conducted in Canada in the late 1970s known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park\" title=\"\">Rat Park</a>. The psychologist Bruce Alexander found that lab rats, while isolated in empty cages with the option of drinking either plain or drugged water, easily became addicted to heroin; if you put rats in a vast, toy-filled enclosure with other male and female rats for company, the heroin couldn\u2019t compete. The context was driving addiction, rather than the drug itself.

      "bodyText": "Addiction was once viewed as an unsavoury fringe disease, tethered to substances with killer withdrawal symptoms, such as alcohol and opium. But now the scope of what humans can be addicted to seems to have snowballed, from sugar to shopping to social media. The UK\u2019s first NHS internet-addiction clinic is opening this year; the World Health Organization (WHO) has included gaming disorder in its official addictions diagnosis guidelines. The first glimmer of this shift was in 1992, when tabloids reported that Michael Douglas \u2013 Hollywood royalty, fresh from starring in the erotic thriller Basic Instinct \u2013 was holed up in an Arizonan rehab facility with sex addiction. No matter that, to this day, Douglas stringently denies ever suffering from the condition \u2013 the way we perceive addiction had begun to unfurl. Back then, the broadening of the term was often viewed in medical circles as lazy appropriation; however, neuroscience has now largely accepted that it is the same brain chemical, dopamine, driving these irrepressible cravings. What\u2019s more, our 21st-century world is so heavily baited with cues and stimuli \u2013 from stealthy marketing to junk food, not to mention the nagging lure of online life \u2013 that it appears to be rigging our dopamine systems to become \u201chypersensitised\u201d. \u201cThe range of what people are getting addicted to has increased,\u201d confirms Michael Lynskey, a professor of addiction at King\u2019s College London. \u201cFor my parents\u2019 generation, the only options were tobacco and alcohol. Now there are more drugs, including synthetics, along with commercialisation and ways \u2013 especially online \u2013 of encouraging prolonged use of different things.\u201d Many of these emerging conditions are seen as behavioural rather than physical, substance-related addictions \u2013 but the consequences can be as grave. Gambling is the longest established behavioural addiction, having been medically recognised since 2013. Suicide rates, along with the likelihood of substance addiction, are higher among compulsive gamblers. \u201cI see gambling students who drop out of university because they can\u2019t stop,\u201d says Henrietta Bowden-Jones, the consultant psychiatrist behind the forthcoming NHS internet-addiction clinic. \u201cI see people with shopping compulsions who are in so much debt because they couldn\u2019t stop themselves from buying three dresses in different sizes, that in the end their businesses and families suffer.\u201d Sometimes, she says, compulsions flit between different vices \u2013 for example, a young man seeking refuge from family problems might toggle between gaming and porn. \u201cI saw [a gaming disorder patient] yesterday,\u201d she adds, \u201cwho then went on to spending money on objects and clothes. You can somehow shift the behaviour but it\u2019s an illness we don\u2019t yet know enough about.\u201d It is hard to overlook, however, the fact that many of these thrills are available at the touch of a screen. When the addiction charity Addaction commissioned a YouGov survey in October 2018, it found that parents are twice as worried about their teenage children being addicted to social media as they are about drugs, and a similar ratio when comparing worries about gaming and drugs. Also in October, the EU announced it would fund the European Problematic Use of the Internet Research Network to investigate the public health implications. Not everyone agrees with defining these new disorders as addictions \u2013 after all, you can\u2019t overdose on them. Gambling and gaming are the only ones to have made it on to the WHO list of addictions. However, a paradigm shift in understanding addiction is in motion. Take sex addiction. Seeking treatment for this controversial condition has, in cases such as that of the golfer Tiger Woods, been criticised as a cynical shortcut to redemption for philanderers. On the other hand, neuroscientists who have been able to study the brains of people with debilitatingly compulsive obsessions with sex witness similar responses to those they have observed in drug addiction cases. Most of the standard criteria for addiction diagnosis do apply to these disorders, says Lynskey: \u201cTolerance, neglect of responsibilities, inability to stop, withdrawal.\u201d Withdrawal is the obvious sticking point, although sugar withdrawal symptoms have been induced in lab rats \u2013 sweats, shakes, changes in body temperature, anxiety, the whole kaboodle. \u201cIf a teenager becomes irritable when a gaming session is cut short, there\u2019s some discussion as to whether that\u2019s a sort of mild withdrawal,\u201d says Lynskey. Terry Robinson, an esteemed professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Michigan \u2013 together with his colleague, Kent Berridge \u2013 identified dopamine as the neurochemical responsible for craving. He thinks debating the semantics of addiction is unhelpful. \u201cWhether it\u2019s drugs, sex, gambling or whatever, you\u2019re looking at impulse-control disorders where people have difficulty refraining from maladaptive use. There are certainly similarities in terms of the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms involved.\u201d Once Robinson and Berridge had identified dopamine as \u201cwanting\u201d and pleasurable brain opiates as \u201cliking\u201d \u2013 two distinct phenomena \u2013 they discovered that you don\u2019t have to like something in order to want it: a key finding about addiction. In addicts\u2019 brains, the craving is unbearable even when they no longer like the object of their desire. Berridge once told me that the \u201cmassive\u201d, \u201crobust\u201d wanting systems in the brain can be turned on with or without pleasure, whereas pleasure \u201chas a much smaller and more fragile brain basis \u2026 That\u2019s why life\u2019s intense pleasures are less frequent and less sustained than life\u2019s intense desires\u201d. It also explains, perhaps, why humans are so easily herded into wanting new stuff and instant gratification, even when these things don\u2019t make us happy. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in these addictions,\u201d says Robinson, \u201cis that the dopamine system is becoming hypersensitised, leading to these pathological motivational states.\u201d He has identified three factors that could help explain why \u201cthere seems to be a wider variety of problematic things [to get addicted to]\u201d. (He does caution, however, that \u201cgetting into social factors is very difficult in terms of proving cause and effect\u201d.) The first factor is that our modern environment is stuffed with craving-inducing stimuli. \u201cPeople don\u2019t appreciate the power of cues that have been associated with rewards, be it a drug or sex or food, in generating motivational states.\u201d In fact, addicts can start liking the cues more than the end goal, such as the rigmarole of scoring drugs and so on. \u201cThe amount of cues associated with highly palatable foods are everywhere now,\u201d he says. \u201cDrugs, sex and gambling as well, and that has changed quite a bit over the years and could be leading to more problematic use.\u201d Lynskey agrees, adding \u201csome of the marketing and design of gambling machines is a step ahead of all of us academics in devising ways to attract users and boost dopamine and retain them\u201d. The \u201clike\u201d button, quantifying approval and igniting a compulsion to check social media, is a similar example. Introducing a report into the effects of social media on young people in early 2018, the UK\u2019s children\u2019s commissioner Anne Longfield wrote that \u201csome children are becoming almost addicted to \u2018likes\u2019 as a form of social validation\u201d. Robinson\u2019s second consideration is dosage. Our liking of sweet tastes suited us when we were hunter-gatherers, helping us choose ripe energy sources. Now, we have high-fructose corn syrup, which blows our minds with unnatural levels of glucose. Similarly with drugs, he points out: \u201cChewing coca leaves in the Andes is not the same as smoking crack cocaine. The pharmacology is different and this can also increase propensity to addiction.\u201d His final factor is simply access. \u201cFood, sex, gambling and drugs \u2013 availability these days is much greater than it was in the past.\u201d (Sex addiction can include consuming porn, sexting, compulsive masturbation, exhibitionism and chemsex.) All these factors, Robinson continues, \u201ccombine in complex ways \u2013 and I\u2019m sure we don\u2019t understand them all \u2013 to increase the probability of problematic use in a variety of things\u201d. Does this mean that more people are at risk in this era of throbbing dopamine excitation? Major risk factors for addiction, such as deprivation and childhood trauma, are still important predictors for how easily your dopamine system can be hijacked, says Robinson \u2013 \u201cbut you have laden on top of that ubiquitous cues, more potent formulations and increased availability\u201d. Another theory about what is driving the diversification of addictive behaviours stems from a series of experiments conducted in Canada in the late 1970s known as Rat Park. The psychologist Bruce Alexander found that lab rats, while isolated in empty cages with the option of drinking either plain or drugged water, easily became addicted to heroin; if you put rats in a vast, toy-filled enclosure with other male and female rats for company, the heroin couldn\u2019t compete. The context was driving addiction, rather than the drug itself. The resulting study made minimal waves when it was published \u2013 yet today, Alexander is being flown all over the world to share his take on addiction, which he calls the dislocation theory. \u201cThe modern world breaks down all kinds of community, all kinds of tradition and religions and stuff that has made life integral and full for people in the past,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say: \u2018OK, now I\u2019m going to give you back what modernity took away.\u2019 We have to reinvent society, as we perpetually do, with an eye on making sure there are enough connections for human beings with each other in a traditional way, so that people can grow up and be content enough so they don\u2019t need to find substitutes in addiction for life.\u201d Organisations such as Addaction in the UK, he says, \u201care finding ways to get [addicts] together into groups and planting these groups in communities and getting the community to support people in these groups, not to give up their addictions but to have a meaningful life\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Imagine that you could buy, in thousands of shops across the country, canisters containing toxic gas. Imagine that some people walked the streets, squirting this gas into the face of every child they passed. Imagine that it became a craze, so that a child couldn\u2019t walk a metre without receiving a faceful. Imagine that, while a single dose was unlikely to cause serious harm, repeated doses damaged their hearts, lungs and brains, affecting their health, their intelligence and their life chances. It would be treated as a national emergency. Sales of the canisters would immediately be banned. The police would be mobilised. If existing laws against poisoning children were deemed insufficient, new legislation would be rushed through parliament. It\u2019s not hard to picture this response, is it? Yet the mass poisoning is happening. And nothing changes. According to a paper in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, burning fossil fuels is now \u201cthe world\u2019s most significant threat to children\u2019s health\u201d. Their life chances are compromised before they are born. Toxic particles from exhaust fumes pass through the lungs of pregnant women and accumulate in the placenta. The risk of premature birth and low birth weight this causes is described in the British Medical Journal as \u201csomething approaching a public health catastrophe\u201d. Among the likely impacts of repeated poisoning, researchers now believe, is a \u201chuge reduction\u201d in intelligence. A paper published last year found that \u201clong-term exposure to air pollution impedes cognitive performance in verbal and math tests\u201d. Pollution stunts the growth of lungs as well as minds, raising the risk of asthma, cancer, stroke and heart failure. How will this affect the Diesel Generation: in other words, those born since 2001? This was the year in which Tony Blair\u2019s government, rather than delivering the integrated public transport it had long promised, sought to tweak the carbon emissions from cars by taxing diesel engines at a lower rate than petrol engines. Diesel cars might produce a little less carbon dioxide, but they release more nitrogen oxides and particulates, a tendency exacerbated by the manufacturers\u2019 cheating. An entire generation \u2013 18 years of births \u2013 has been exposed to the results of this folly. Given that researchers have found an association between air pollution and childhood mental illness, could this help explain the rising prevalence of psychiatric disorders among English children since the first major survey, in 1999? A study conducted in London suggests that people with the highest exposure to pollution also have a greater risk of developing dementia. Might we have triggered a dementia timebomb, that could explode in 40 or 50 years? The only difference between the absurd scenario with which this article began and reality is intent: no one means to poison children with their exhaust fumes. But the absence of a mens rea makes no difference to their health. The one-tonne metal canisters are still on sale (though the number bought has dipped slightly in the past year) and toxic gas is pumped into our children\u2019s faces with every step they take. Especially on the way to and from school. These are the times at which children inhale the most particulates (especially if they are driven \u2013 exposure is much greater inside a car than on the pavement). Horrifying recent data also reveals that pollutants from nearby roads accumulate in classrooms, leading to higher levels inside than out.

They don\u2019t trust the Treasury.\u201d As head of strategy for Britain Stronger in Europe, Ryan Coetzee had bombarded Britons with evidence of the economic damage they would do to themselves if they didn\u2019t stay in the EU. He and his team enlisted the Bank of England, the IMF, the OECD and pretty much every acronym that mattered. They\u2019d wagged fingers, flung numbers around and pointed out the danger signs.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/27/business-confidence-in-uk-at-lowest-ebb-since-brexit-vote-iod\">Business confidence in UK at lowest ebb since Brexit vote \u2013 IoD</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>From David Cameron down, leading remainers considered the economy their trump card. In the biggest single choice Britain had had to make for four decades, they were sure economics would be the deciding factor. But with less than a month to go before the vote, seasoned operative Coetzee could see the strategy was failing. Why, just a few days earlier, George Osborne had produced Treasury analysis that Brexit would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/20/eu-referendum-george-osborne-house-prices-brexit\" title=\"\">send house prices plunging</a> by as much as 18% \u2013 and BBC journalists reported being deluged with calls from would-be buyers asking where they could sign up.</p> \n<p>As remain started losing its central argument so, internal polling analysis showed, it began trailing leave. Hence the panic in that late-night memo, quoted by Tim Shipman in his history of the referendum, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/21/all-out-war-tim-shipman-the-brexit-club-owen-bennett-bad-boys-of-brexit-arron-banks-review\" title=\"\">All Out War</a>. One of Shipman\u2019s Labour sources in the campaign cut close to the bone: \u201cWhen we started just saying, \u2018the economy will be fucked\u2019, it showed what a profound misunderstanding they had of Labour motives. Across the north-east and the north-west people already felt like the economy was fucked and not working for them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bingo. Project Fear stuck as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/21/brexiteers-project-fear-expert-warnings\" title=\"\">catchphrase</a> precisely because Osborne\u2019s rhapsodies over the health of the economy sounded to so many like Project Fantasy.</p> \n<p>Osborne banged on about Britain\u2019s miracle recovery even while pay remained below pre-crash levels. His replacement at No 11, Philip Hammond, made a big flourish in his last budget of doling out \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/oct/30/schools-angry-philip-hammond-budget-little-extras-education\" title=\"\">little extras</a>\u201d to schools where teachers now face huge funding shortfalls. Over the past few years Westminster has embarked on a march of the makers that looked more like a punch-drunk stagger, erected a northern powerhouse almost invisible to the naked eye, and declared a war on skivers and freeloaders \u2013 led by Iain Duncan Smith, the cabinet minister who <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/iain-duncan-smith-claimed-breakfast-1810086\" title=\"\">claimed \u00a339 in expenses for one solitary breakfast</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dcc3ea7a-df72-4cd5-ab30-00d9f00a583c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ALT-3tM5YoU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But this economic chasm runs deeper and longer than just the past decade. Around the same time that Coetzee was raising the alarm in Westminster, I was reporting in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/06/politicians-eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Pontypool</a>, south Wales. It was market day, and locals reminisced about old times, when the town centre would be \u201crammed\u201d. In that day\u2019s drizzle it was half-deserted. In the 80s and 90s, voters in south Wales were assured that vibrant new industries would replace the coalmines and steelworks that had shut down. What actually filled the void was public spending, and casual work and self-employment that barely paid its way.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s dead now, because they took what they wanted,\u201d Neil told me, his glasses specked with paint from his day job as a decorator. \u201cThey\u201d meant Westminster, London, the rich. \u201cThatcher smashed the unions. Boosh! We\u2019re out of here. Boosh! They\u2019ve moved on.\u201d Raised in a Labour family in a blood-red part of the country that had been deceived by the political classes for so long, he now considered all politicians \u201cliars\u201d. And in the EU referendum, he intended to let them know.</p> \n<p>In the crudest of ways, Neil and others got some of what they wanted. Since the summer of 2016, politicians and pundits will freely declare that something in British politics and economics is broken. The trouble is, the governing classes are no closer to knowing what exactly is bust, let alone how to fix it.</p> \n<p>It ultimately comes down to this: decades of privatisation, hammering unions and chucking billions at the housing market while stripping the welfare state has effectively ended any semblance of a national, redistributive economy in which a child born in Sunderland can expect to have similar life chances to one born in Surrey. Yet politicians remain fixated on mechanisms that no longer work adequately for those who actually depend on the economy. They obsess over GDP growth when the benefits of that are unequally shared between classes and regions. They boast about job creation when wages are still on the floor.</p> \n<p>Most of all, they brag about London, the one undoubted gleaming success of the British economic model. \u201cA pound spent in Croydon is of far more value to the country than a pound spent in Strathclyde,\u201d to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/30/boris-spending-london-economic-woes\" title=\"\">quote</a> Boris Johnson, the Conservative party\u2019s last surviving greyback. But that is to ignore how London itself is rapidly becoming unlivable for many Londoners. New research by academics the <a href=\"https://foundationaleconomy.com/\" title=\"\">Foundational Economy Collective</a> shows that Londoners are the least likely in the country to have a mortgage and the most likely to swim in the shark-infested waters of the private rental sector. This is great for landlords and for employers, who enjoy a conveyor belt of ready-made renters and workers supplied to them from the rest of Britain and Europe. It is not such a great bargain for the rest of us. The high income generated by London is matched by the massive income inequality suffered by Londoners.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/20/national-emergency-brexit-vote-westminster\">There\u2019s a national emergency all right \u2013 but it isn\u2019t Brexit | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The irony is that Neil and other Labour leave voters have handed the keys to the very people least interested in reversing any of this. The top economic brains among the Brexiteers, miserable throwbacks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/09/cabinet-brexiteer-vision-chilling-neo-thatcherite\" title=\"\">such as Patrick Minford and John Redwood</a>, believe the problem with Thatcher\u2019s revolution is that it didn\u2019t go far enough.</p> \n<p>We rarely ask people what they want from the economy; if we did it more often, the answers might surprise us. The free-marketeers at the Legatum Institute did pose the question in a <a href=\"https://www.li.com/activities/publications/public-opinion-in-the-post-brexit-era-economic-attitudes-in-modern-britain\" title=\"\">survey</a> conducted in 2017. Top priorities for respondents were: food and water; emergency services; universal healthcare; a good house; a decent well-paying job; and compulsory and free education. At the bottom were owning a car and cheap air travel. HS2, a new runway at Heathrow or a garden bridge on the Thames didn\u2019t even rank.</p> \n<p>After reporting the survey, the Legatum Institute concluded: \u201cSignificant portions of the country \u2026 are vehemently anti-capitalist.\u201d The report was co-authored by Matthew Elliott, former head of the Vote Leave campaign. Which just about sums up the Brexiteers\u2019 politics: savvy enough to listen to what people want, cynical enough never to enact it.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Just after midnight on 25 May 2016, a senior staffer in the remain campaign sent colleagues an urgent message. \u201cVoters are very sceptical about our warnings on the economy,\u201d began his email. \u201cThey don\u2019t trust the numbers. They don\u2019t trust the Treasury.\u201d As head of strategy for Britain Stronger in Europe, Ryan Coetzee had bombarded Britons with evidence of the economic damage they would do to themselves if they didn\u2019t stay in the EU. He and his team enlisted the Bank of England, the IMF, the OECD and pretty much every acronym that mattered. They\u2019d wagged fingers, flung numbers around and pointed out the danger signs. From David Cameron down, leading remainers considered the economy their trump card. In the biggest single choice Britain had had to make for four decades, they were sure economics would be the deciding factor. But with less than a month to go before the vote, seasoned operative Coetzee could see the strategy was failing. Why, just a few days earlier, George Osborne had produced Treasury analysis that Brexit would send house prices plunging by as much as 18% \u2013 and BBC journalists reported being deluged with calls from would-be buyers asking where they could sign up. As remain started losing its central argument so, internal polling analysis showed, it began trailing leave. Hence the panic in that late-night memo, quoted by Tim Shipman in his history of the referendum, All Out War. One of Shipman\u2019s Labour sources in the campaign cut close to the bone: \u201cWhen we started just saying, \u2018the economy will be fucked\u2019, it showed what a profound misunderstanding they had of Labour motives. Across the north-east and the north-west people already felt like the economy was fucked and not working for them.\u201d Bingo. Project Fear stuck as a catchphrase precisely because Osborne\u2019s rhapsodies over the health of the economy sounded to so many like Project Fantasy. Osborne banged on about Britain\u2019s miracle recovery even while pay remained below pre-crash levels. His replacement at No 11, Philip Hammond, made a big flourish in his last budget of doling out \u201clittle extras\u201d to schools where teachers now face huge funding shortfalls. Over the past few years Westminster has embarked on a march of the makers that looked more like a punch-drunk stagger, erected a northern powerhouse almost invisible to the naked eye, and declared a war on skivers and freeloaders \u2013 led by Iain Duncan Smith, the cabinet minister who claimed \u00a339 in expenses for one solitary breakfast. But this economic chasm runs deeper and longer than just the past decade. Around the same time that Coetzee was raising the alarm in Westminster, I was reporting in Pontypool, south Wales. It was market day, and locals reminisced about old times, when the town centre would be \u201crammed\u201d. In that day\u2019s drizzle it was half-deserted. In the 80s and 90s, voters in south Wales were assured that vibrant new industries would replace the coalmines and steelworks that had shut down. What actually filled the void was public spending, and casual work and self-employment that barely paid its way. \u201cIt\u2019s dead now, because they took what they wanted,\u201d Neil told me, his glasses specked with paint from his day job as a decorator. \u201cThey\u201d meant Westminster, London, the rich. \u201cThatcher smashed the unions. Boosh! We\u2019re out of here. Boosh! They\u2019ve moved on.\u201d Raised in a Labour family in a blood-red part of the country that had been deceived by the political classes for so long, he now considered all politicians \u201cliars\u201d. And in the EU referendum, he intended to let them know. In the crudest of ways, Neil and others got some of what they wanted. Since the summer of 2016, politicians and pundits will freely declare that something in British politics and economics is broken. The trouble is, the governing classes are no closer to knowing what exactly is bust, let alone how to fix it. It ultimately comes down to this: decades of privatisation, hammering unions and chucking billions at the housing market while stripping the welfare state has effectively ended any semblance of a national, redistributive economy in which a child born in Sunderland can expect to have similar life chances to one born in Surrey. Yet politicians remain fixated on mechanisms that no longer work adequately for those who actually depend on the economy. They obsess over GDP growth when the benefits of that are unequally shared between classes and regions. They boast about job creation when wages are still on the floor. Most of all, they brag about London, the one undoubted gleaming success of the British economic model. \u201cA pound spent in Croydon is of far more value to the country than a pound spent in Strathclyde,\u201d to quote Boris Johnson, the Conservative party\u2019s last surviving greyback. But that is to ignore how London itself is rapidly becoming unlivable for many Londoners. New research by academics the Foundational Economy Collective shows that Londoners are the least likely in the country to have a mortgage and the most likely to swim in the shark-infested waters of the private rental sector. This is great for landlords and for employers, who enjoy a conveyor belt of ready-made renters and workers supplied to them from the rest of Britain and Europe. It is not such a great bargain for the rest of us. The high income generated by London is matched by the massive income inequality suffered by Londoners. The irony is that Neil and other Labour leave voters have handed the keys to the very people least interested in reversing any of this. The top economic brains among the Brexiteers, miserable throwbacks such as Patrick Minford and John Redwood, believe the problem with Thatcher\u2019s revolution is that it didn\u2019t go far enough. We rarely ask people what they want from the economy; if we did it more often, the answers might surprise us. The free-marketeers at the Legatum Institute did pose the question in a survey conducted in 2017. Top priorities for respondents were: food and water; emergency services; universal healthcare; a good house; a decent well-paying job; and compulsory and free education. At the bottom were owning a car and cheap air travel. HS2, a new runway at Heathrow or a garden bridge on the Thames didn\u2019t even rank. After reporting the survey, the Legatum Institute concluded: \u201cSignificant portions of the country \u2026 are vehemently anti-capitalist.\u201d The report was co-authored by Matthew Elliott, former head of the Vote Leave campaign. Which just about sums up the Brexiteers\u2019 politics: savvy enough to listen to what people want, cynical enough never to enact it. \u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist",

From their end I can kind of understand why they are a little bit slow \u2013 there are 300 apartments they have to work through.\u201d On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Icon said all residents would have their accommodation paid for as long as it took for their apartments to be declared safe. But Dave said he had not yet heard this from Icon. \u201cThey have not sent out any communication about covering the costs that extend beyond Friday \u2013 which is a little bit concerning,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the people I\u2019ve spoken with are at Airbnbs and hotels, which require notice to extend.\u201d An email to residents, obtained by Guardian Australia, said the allowances ranged between $220 and $500 a night. Residents receive $220 a night for a one-bedroom unit, $300 for two bedrooms, $400 for three bedrooms and $500 for four bedrooms. Icon evacuated the building on 27 December and, last Friday, the NSW planning minister, Anthony Roberts, said nobody should be moved back until the tower was cleared by government investigators. The government investigation is being led by two professors of engineering from the University of NSW and the University of Newcastle. On Friday, Roberts said an \u201cinitial report\u201d should be ready during the next week. When asked whether some residents could return this week, the Icon spokeswoman said it depended on the government\u2019s report. \u201cWe are certainly hopeful it will be this Friday but we cannot preempt the government\u2019s independent engineers,\u201d she said. \u201cFor around 50 apartments who are on the original vertical line where the issue occurred, residents will need to be out for a longer period of time. They will progressively return over the coming four to six weeks. \u201cWe are speaking to them on a one-to-one basis, looking for significant long-term accommodation in the form of Airbnbs or serviced apartments. As soon as their apartment is spick and span we will be doing everything we can to relocate them. \u201cFor the time they are required to find accommodation elsewhere, we will meet their accommodation costs and their reasonable living expenses as we have done up to this point.\u201d The professors\u2019 interim briefing found there were no issues with the building\u2019s foundations but that there were \u201cdesign and construction issues\u201d.",

His ploy catches Kyrgios, the umpire and the crowd completely unawares! And it rather neatly sums up him, although his victory today was dominant.

That duck will be broken today, in the refined surrounds of the Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club, as preparations are fine tuned ahead of next week\u2019s season-opening major, the Australian Open.</p> <p>Inevitably, given their respective profiles, shared history and, um, interesting characters, there has been a degree of hype surrounding the buildup to this match. Tomic, intentionally or not, added some fuel to the fire (even though it may have been mere lighter fluid rather than a can of petrol) when saying yesterday that Kyrgios is \u201cmentally struggling\u201d at the moment. </p> <p>Yet both players have maintained their off-court clashes of the past \u2013 notably nearly three years ago when Tomic accused Kyrgios of faking an illness to get out of playing a Davis Cup match \u2013 are behind them, and considering the relaxed nature of this tournament, it\u2019s unlikely sparks will fly when the pair finally do face off across the net.</p> <p>What we might get is an indication of where each player is at just days out from the Open. At least that\u2019s the hope \u2013 Tomic also expressed a concern that Kyrgios might not take the match entirely seriously and as such his ability to complete his preparations for Melbourne Park will be affected. You could argue that\u2019s a bit rich coming from a player with Tomic\u2019s track record...</p> <p>Anyway, whatever happens over the next hour or two is sure to be of intrigue. Stick with me for the match \u2013 the players will be out soon, with Marin \u010cili\u0107 and Kevin Anderson\u2019s preceding match having just ended in the Croat\u2019s favour, 6-3, 4-6, 15-13, following a lengthy match tie-break.</p> <p>Do get in touch if you feel you need to get something off your chest.

      "bodyText": "Well, well , well. It\u2019s been quite the day of tennis. Following on from Bernard Tomic\u2019s win over Nick Kyrgios, sealed in the most outrageous/sneaky/unsportmanlike fashion, Ash Barty has delivered a warning to Australian Open title hopefuls with a straight-set victory over the world No 1 Simona Halep. That will do wonders for her before heading to Melbourne Park next week. But before that, she has the chance to add another title to her burgeoning collection having secured a spot in the Sydney International quarter-finals. That\u2019s all for now from me. Thanks for joining in the fun, until next time. Here\u2019s Barty on-court: \u201cIt was extremely difficult conditions. Very swirly conditions at court level. She gave me a belting in Montreal. I learnt a bit more in Cincinnati. I believed I could win. I\u2019m very happy I could come out and execute.\u201d Second set: Halep* 4-6, 4-6 Barty (*denotes server): Oh my goodness! Barty beats the world No 1 for the biggest win of her career! The charge towards the finish line begins at 15-30 down when she reaches down low and hits the ball back across Halep and in by the finest of margins! Halep hits back but Barty brings up deuce a point later to the delight of the Sydney crowd! Halep challenges the next call \u2013 it\u2019s called out, and it is indeed out \u2013 to bring up match point! What a phenomenal result for Barty! Second set: Halep 4-6, 4-5 Barty* (*denotes server): The wind appears to pick up and is playing no small role in this match now, just as the sun disappears behind some clouds to give the players some brief respite. Meanwhile, Barty holds her nerve and her serve when it matters, after two deuces. The crowd is getting more vocal, and is clearly behind the Queenslander. Halep will now have to serve to stay in the match. Second set: Halep* 4-6, 4-4 Barty (*denotes server): You feel that Barty has to hit back immediately and she does extremely well to force deuce with a difficult low half-volley that she nails. Halep finds the net on the next point and Barty follows with an inch-perfect forehand right into the corner to do exactly what was needed! We\u2019re back on serve. Second set: Halep 4-6, 4-3 Barty* (*denotes server): Halep again gives a glimpse of what she\u2019s capable of, firing a beautiful backhand back past Barty to bring up another break point. And this time, she makes no mistake! The Romanian makes the first breakthrough of this second set and Barty has a lot to do now to avoid a third set. Second set: Halep* 4-6, 3-3 Barty (*denotes server): Halep keeps things on serve without too much fuss before new balls are called for. Bad news for Sam Stosur fans over on Court 1 \u2013 the former US Open champ has been ousted from the competition in three sets by Swiss Timea beats Bacsinszky. Second set: Halep 4-6, 2-3 Barty* (*denotes server): Halep puts Barty under some serious pressure now though, and the Australian has to dig herself out of a hole at two break points down. But she does that, wearing down Halep who eventually goes wide on the second one. An ace then gets Barty back on track and then a brilliant point finished off at the net secures the game for the Newcombe medal winner. Second set: Halep* 4-6, 2-2 Barty (*denotes server): Oh that\u2019s a wonderful shot from Barty to kick off this game! A glorious forehand winner down the line is too good for Halep, but the Romanian recovers to hold once more. Second set: Halep 4-6, 1-2 Barty* (*denotes server): In contrast to the previous game, there\u2019s no messing about on serve here. Barty serves out without fuss to edge ahead once more and put the pressure back on Halep. Second set: Halep* 4-6, 1-1 Barty (*denotes server): Hello, what\u2019s this? Barty has two more break points \u2013 Halep wobbles on her serve on the first point, missing the first and then clipping the net on the second. But she makes no mistake when given another opportunity, before saving the second break point too. Barty gets another chance a point later, but again it\u2019s wasted and Halep holds eventually. Might Barty come to regret that by the end of this match? Second set: Halep 4-6, 0-1 Barty* (*denotes server): Blink and you miss it kind of game to open the second set. No problems at all for the Australian No 1. The next hour of tennis will tell us a lot about Barty, and how far she has come over the past 12 months. First set: Halep* 4-6 Barty (*denotes server): Barty brings up her 21st unforced error \u2013 to Halep\u2019s nine so far \u2013 but a much improved point brings up set point, which she duly takes! That\u2019s the first set she has taken off Halep in their previous two meetings. Can she build on that and go on to win this one? First set: Halep 4-5 Barty* (*denotes server): Halep cranks up the pressure early this game and Barty has to dig deep to save three break points. But she does, and then she aces for a second time this game to hold. A real test of character passed with flying colours there! First set: Halep* 4-4 Barty (*denotes server): Halep looks really comfortable on serve for the first time today, serving out to love. It\u2019s evenly-matched so far, little to split the pair. First set: Halep 3-4 Barty* (*denotes server): An indication of the windy conditions facing the players today presents itself at the start of this game as Barty has to toss again. She puts it out of mind as she then beautifully disguises a volley at the net before going on to open up a 40-0 lead. A crosscourt forehand winner at 40-30 seals the deal a couple of points later as we edge towards the conclusion of the first set. First set: Halep* 3-3 Barty (*denotes server): Lovely tennis from Barty at the start of this game, as she comes to the net before finishing off the point. A point later, the Australian\u2019s tactics are the same, but this time she puts her volley long to bring Halep back into the game at 30-30. Barty\u2019s radar is off again on the next two points and Halep holds. First set: Halep 2-3 Barty* (*denotes server): Halep\u2019s not ranked one in the world for nothing though. She stays cool in the heat to race into a 40-0 lead on Barty\u2019s serve and despite losing the next two points she breaks back immediately. First set: Halep* 1-3 Barty (*denotes server): Is this Barty\u2019s chance to break for a first time? She does it! Halep can only find the net on break point, prompting a solitary \u201cAussie, Aussie, Aussie, oi, oi etc\u201d chant from the stands. Over on court one, Sam Stosur has been taken to a third set by Timea Bacsinszky of Switzerland. First set: Halep 1-2 Barty* (*denotes server): Oof, what a point! Lovely play from both players results in Barty chipping over Halep, who responds with an attempted tweener that sadly doesn\u2019t hit the mark. Barty then moves Halep around the court with apparent ease to move to within game point and she doesn\u2019t look back from there. It\u2019s 45 degrees and windy out on the court, by the way. Not easy conditions for either of them. First set: Halep* 1-1 Barty (*denotes server): Halep gets a first chance to show what her serve is all about. It\u2019s enough to give Barty a few problems with her return, and a few mis-placed forehands help Halep to the game. First set: Halep 0-1 Barty* (*denotes server): Here we go then. On a baking blue court at Sydney\u2019s Olympic Park, Barty, with cap on head and ball in hand, survives a deuce thanks to a booming serve and then a well-disguised drop-shot that completely fools Halep. A decent start for the Aussie No 1. Halep and Barty are now both out on court and warming up, and we\u2019ll be underway shortly. \u201cThirty seconds,\u201d is the umpire\u2019s call. Barty won the toss and will serve first. Barty, one of Australian sport\u2019s brightest lights over the course of last year, booked her date with Halep thanks to a 6-3 6-3 first-round victory over 2017 French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko yesterday. Even before that though, there was plenty of talk of her Australian Open chances; today\u2019s match will give us more of an insight into that, although the player herself says she is perfectly prepared for her grand slam tilt, regardless of what happens against the best player in the world today. \u201cI feel like I have played enough matches now. I\u2019m ready, feel pretty good on the court. There\u2019s certainly no better challenge than coming up against Simona right before a slam,\u201d Barty said. De Minaur seems like such a nice boy. He moves into the last eight in Sydney where he will meet compatriot Jordan Thompson: \u201cI\u2019m glad things went my way today,\u201d he says. Before Australia\u2019s top-ranked player gets onto Ken Rosewall Arena though, one of those players Kyrgios said he is excited about is in action \u2013 Alex De Minaur. And would you believe it, we join the match with the Australian at match point! He does it! De Minaur wins 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) against Reilly Opelka of the US to move into the quarter-final! OK, that wraps it up at Kooyong. And given the no-nonsense nature of the match, we\u2019re in good time to cross over to the Sydney International, where Ash Barty is close to starting her match with Simona Halep. Kyrgios continues the interview off-court. On the pre-match hype, he pulls no punches: \u201cThe media is always going to paint the picture they want to see. I understand the media: the bigger the story the bigger the pay check. I don\u2019t pay attention to that bullshit.\u201d On next week\u2019s Australian Open: \u201cI love playing in front of my home crowd [at Melbourne Park]. I feel super comfortable there and it feels like my back yard.\u201d Is he enjoying playing tennis at the moment? \u201cAt the moment I\u2019m in a good space mentally. Everyone goes through their struggles. It\u2019s an exciting time of year, the Aussie summer. There are so many exciting players coming through, De Minaur, Millman. I just hope the Aussies go out there and soak it up. We\u2019re pretty lucky.\u201d Some words from the players. (It\u2019s not an easy job interviewing this pair.) Kyrgios: \u201cHe\u2019s a great player and it\u2019s great to see him enjoying some success. It was good to see BT our there today.\u201d Tomic: \u201cFor us it\u2019s just important to be here in these conditions. I hope for Nick\u2019s sake he can play well [in the Australian Open].\u201d Kyrgios: \u201cI know Bernard is one of the most talented players out there. He\u2019s got a tricky game, he\u2019s very unorthodox.\u201d Kyrgios, asked for his opinion on the new balls that Tomic complained about yesterday: \u201cThey\u2019re OK. I don\u2019t really care much.\u201d \u201cThe spider bite\u2019s OK. I\u2019m feeling good. Excited to get out there in Melbourne.\u201d Second set: Tomic* 6-3, 6-4 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Tomic, almost lazily, lashes a winner down the line on the opening point to set the tone for this game. And it all ends on a rather bizarre note as Tomic sneakily serves underarm, between his legs, while pretending to ready himself to serve in the normal fashion with another ball. His ploy catches Kyrgios, the umpire and the crowd completely unawares! And it rather neatly sums up him, although his victory today was dominant. Kyrgios takes it well, smiling as he packs his bags. Second set: Tomic 6-3, 5-4 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): That\u2019s just what Kyrgios needed \u2013 a comfortable service game. Indeed, he has very much relied on his serve today \u2013 he\u2019s been off the pace with his groundstrokes. Anyway, he stays alive, but Tomic will now serve for the match. Second set: Tomic* 6-3, 5-3 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Tomic is toying with Kyrgios a little now. He holds serve once more and Kyrgios will have to find something special now if he is to stay in the match. Second set: Tomic 6-3, 4-3 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): More lovely tennis from Tomic at 15-15 as he springs into life to reach a shot at the net before dinking back past Kyrgios. Kyrgios finds the net a point later and he\u2019s facing break point. A wild first serve doesn\u2019t do Kyrgios any favours and when he can\u2019t reach what seems to be a regulation forehand from Tomic, he\u2019s broken for the first time this second set. Excellent work from Tomic, who is now just two games from the match. Second set: Tomic* 6-3, 3-3 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Some languid shotmaking from Tomic is too much for Kyrgios this game and he levels things up at three games apiece. Second set: Tomic 6-3, 2-3 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): The rate at which this pair are getting through their service games is remarkable \u2013 and refreshing. No bouncing the ball 17 times or performing superstitious ticks before each serve for these two. Kyrgios serves out this game in the time it took to type just that one sentence. Second set: Tomic* 6-3, 2-2 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Tomic gets himself into a game-winning position before Kyrgios delivers a lovely drop shot on his way back to deuce. That\u2019s the best he can do though and Tomic goes on to hold. Second set: Tomic 6-3, 1-2 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios is itching to get going at the beginning of each game with the ball in his hand, but he\u2019s definitely a yard behind Tomic today. That\u2019s likely down to the matches Tomic played yesterday, including a doubles outing. Kyrgios will get there, he just needs some court-time to get up to speed. Second set: Tomic* 6-3, 1-1 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Kyrgios responds to losing the first point of this game with an excellent forehand winner but he can\u2019t back it up and a couple of loose shots later, Tomic gets himself on the scoreboard this set. Second set: Tomic 6-3, 0-1 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Now it\u2019s Kyrgios\u2019s turn to ease to a service game. A decent start to the second set for the Canberran. First set: Tomic* 6-3 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Tomic wastes little further time as he serves out confidently to claim the opening set \u2013 convincingly so. \u201cI think I missed one ball,\u201d he says from his chair. Asked how he pulled up after his encountner with Jack Sock yesterday, he says: \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m pretty tired.\u201d First set: Tomic 5-3 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Can Kyrgios hold serve to stay in the set? He can! New balls are taken \u2013 not the kind Tomic called for yesterday though \u2013 but it\u2019s Tomic who takes a 30-0 lead with some flair shotmaking. Kyrgios returns fire with not one, not two, but three aces to bring up game point before sealing the deal. First set: Tomic* 5-2 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Kyrgios is loose on a couple of shots now, and Tomic holds to love again to move to within a game of the first set. Tomic definitely the more composed so far today. First set: Tomic 4-2 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios aces again on the opening point before a lovely deft drop shot at the net is too good for Tomic. A second and then third ace follow as Kyrgios motors through a service game to stay in touch this opening set. First set: Tomic* 4-1 Kyrgios (*denotes server): More good work from Tomic at 0-15 sees him manoeuvre his opponent around the court before finishing it off at the net. He moves to 40-15, at which point Kyrgios absolutely wallops a return of serve back past him, bringing whoops from the crowd! That\u2019s all he\u2019s got this game though and Tomic confirms his break of serve. First set: Tomic 3-1 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): That\u2019s nice from Tomic, who brings up two break points with some neat work at the net. A Kyrgios ace saves the first one but he\u2019s long, way long, at the baseline on the second and Tomic accepts the advantage for the first time today. First set: Tomic* 2-1 Kyrgios (*denotes server): The first signs of a Tomic wobble are instantly eased as he aces on break point and we\u2019re still on serve in the first set. Wonder how Tomic is finding the balls today? No visual sign of discontent so far. First set: Tomic 1-1 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Smiles from Kyrgios as he claims the first point following a booming first serve and then a deft touch at the net. Actually, replays show he reached over the net to get the ball, which possibly explains his grin \u2013 he shouldn\u2019t have been awarded that point! He goes on to hold and level things up. First set: Tomic* 1-0 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Tomic looks comfortable in his opening service game, winning it to love as Kyrgios make a couple of unforced errors. First set: Tomic* 0-0 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Kyrgios looks relaxed in the warmup. Tomic to serve first and we\u2019re underway! Here they come! Kyrgios emerges into the sunshine in a pink shirt and maroon shorts; Tomic follows after taking some selfies in a blue shirt and white shorts. They\u2019re ready for the toss and we\u2019ll be underway shortly. Once Tomic and Kyrgios are done in Melbourne, and fingers crossed the timings are kind, we\u2019ll turn our attentions to Ashleigh Barty\u2019s clash with world No 1 Simona Halep at the Sydney International. It\u2019s a mouthwatering encounter that will give a real indication of Barty\u2019s chances at next week\u2019s Open. Start time there is scheduled for 2:30pm AEDT, so with a little bit of luck it won\u2019t overlap too much with the match at Kooyong. Tomic wasn\u2019t holding back with his views following his opening win over American Jack Sock yesterday \u2013 he also made clear his displeasure at the new balls being used in these Australian Open warmup events, and for the grand slam tournament itself. The switch from Wilson to Dunlop is likely to prompt further debate as Monday\u2019s opening nears. Incredibly, for two players who seem to have been on the scene forever, Bernard Tomic and Nick Kyrgios have never played a competitive match against each other. That duck will be broken today, in the refined surrounds of the Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club, as preparations are fine tuned ahead of next week\u2019s season-opening major, the Australian Open. Inevitably, given their respective profiles, shared history and, um, interesting characters, there has been a degree of hype surrounding the buildup to this match. Tomic, intentionally or not, added some fuel to the fire (even though it may have been mere lighter fluid rather than a can of petrol) when saying yesterday that Kyrgios is \u201cmentally struggling\u201d at the moment. Yet both players have maintained their off-court clashes of the past \u2013 notably nearly three years ago when Tomic accused Kyrgios of faking an illness to get out of playing a Davis Cup match \u2013 are behind them, and considering the relaxed nature of this tournament, it\u2019s unlikely sparks will fly when the pair finally do face off across the net. What we might get is an indication of where each player is at just days out from the Open. At least that\u2019s the hope \u2013 Tomic also expressed a concern that Kyrgios might not take the match entirely seriously and as such his ability to complete his preparations for Melbourne Park will be affected. You could argue that\u2019s a bit rich coming from a player with Tomic\u2019s track record... Anyway, whatever happens over the next hour or two is sure to be of intrigue. Stick with me for the match \u2013 the players will be out soon, with Marin \u010cili\u0107 and Kevin Anderson\u2019s preceding match having just ended in the Croat\u2019s favour, 6-3, 4-6, 15-13, following a lengthy match tie-break.

He is believed to have been responsible for the deaths of hundreds of people, including a 13-year-old boy who was kidnapped, strangled and dissolved in acid.

Riina\u2019s family was believed to be in financial difficulty after having much of their property confiscated, with his son-in-law pleading poverty and begging for money online.</p> <p>Yesterday, the Sicilian tax agency asked Riina\u2019s family to pay the \u20ac2m (\u00a31.8m) it cost to keep him in prison for 24 years until he died.</p> <p>'\u2018The law expressly excludes that the expenses for costs in prison extends to the family members of the detained.

The online store disappeared soon after being exposed by Italian media.</p> <p>\u201cThis is totally unacceptable,\u201d the mayor of the Sicilian town of Corleone, Nicol\u00f2 Nicolosi, told the Guardian. \u201cIt is not right that members of a family who have killed the image of this city, a family which killed dozens of Corleonesi and Sicilians are using the name of our city for economic advantages and to make money.\u201d</p> <p>Lucia Riina declined to comment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The daughter of a notorious Sicilian mafia boss has opened a restaurant near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris called Corleone. Lucia Riina, a painter and the youngest child of the late \u201cboss of bosses\u201d Salvatore \u201cTot\u00f2\u201d Riina, named the establishment after her father\u2019s home town and the crime family in Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s award-winning Godfather trilogy of films. \u201dDiscover real Italian-Sicilian cuisine in a cosy and elegant place,\u201d says the ad on a Facebook page. Nicknamed the Beast because of his cruelty, Salvatore Riina was an unrepentant criminal who not only assassinated his criminal rivals on an unprecedented scale in the 1980s and 90s, but also targeted the prosecutors, journalists, and judges who sought to stand in his way. He is believed to have been responsible for the deaths of hundreds of people, including a 13-year-old boy who was kidnapped, strangled and dissolved in acid. Riina was serving 26 life sentences when he died of cancer in November 2017. The news of the restaurant opening drew criticism in Italy. Riina\u2019s family was believed to be in financial difficulty after having much of their property confiscated, with his son-in-law pleading poverty and begging for money online. Yesterday, the Sicilian tax agency asked Riina\u2019s family to pay the \u20ac2m (\u00a31.8m) it cost to keep him in prison for 24 years until he died. '\u2018The law expressly excludes that the expenses for costs in prison extends to the family members of the detained. There must have been a mistake,\u201d Riina\u2019s family lawyer, Luca Cianferoni, told the press. It is not the first time that Riina\u2019s family members have capitalised on Sicily\u2019s old image as a mobster haven or their father\u2019s name for their marketing strategy. Less than a month after Tot\u00f2\u2019s death, another of his daughters, Concetta Riina, attempted to trade on his infamy with a range of espresso products bearing his name. Concetta created an online espresso store named Uncle Tot\u00f2 and said she was accepting pre-orders for espresso pods in order to raise money after police seized the family\u2019s savings. The online store disappeared soon after being exposed by Italian media. \u201cThis is totally unacceptable,\u201d the mayor of the Sicilian town of Corleone, Nicol\u00f2 Nicolosi, told the Guardian. \u201cIt is not right that members of a family who have killed the image of this city, a family which killed dozens of Corleonesi and Sicilians are using the name of our city for economic advantages and to make money.\u201d Lucia Riina declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re wrapping up live coverage now. Here\u2019s where things stand: President Donald Trump returned to familiar talking points about immigration in his Oval Office address on Tuesday, the first of his presidency. Top Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer also broke no new ground as well in their rebuttal. Pundits were left unimpressed with both Trump\u2019s remarks and the Democratic response. The partial government shutdown will hit day 19 at midnight with no prospect of a breakthrough in the near future. Join us tomorrow for more live updates. And if you haven\u2019t already, sign up for our US morning briefing for a summary of the day\u2019s top stories and must-reads. Thanks for reading. DNC Chair Tom Perez has released a statement on Trump\u2019s speech. He is not a fan. \u201cLies, fearmongering, finger-pointing, and a manufactured excuse for shutting down the government. Using the Oval Office to deceive the American people and spout offensive, anti-immigrant rhetoric proves, once again, that Donald Trump is unfit to serve as president. \u201c800,000 workers are furloughed without pay. The American people are demanding an end to the Trump Shutdown. Democrats have already voted to end the Trump Shutdown, and we\u2019re ready to pass legislation to fund common-sense, effective border security. It\u2019s time for Republicans in Congress to wake up, stop marching in lockstep behind Trump, and do their jobs \u2013 the president is clearly incapable of doing his.\u201d The New York Times reports that Trump was not excited about giving the speech in the first place. Republican Will Hurd, who represents more of the border than any other member of Congress, expressed his frustration with the shutdown today. Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign is already using the speech to raise money both via email and text. Bernie Sanders is giving his own personal response to Trump and is not impressed. RNC chair Ronna McDaniel has just weighed in to praise Trump in statement: Tonight, Americans saw their president fighting for a solution to fund our government while protecting American citizens, versus the approach of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer which is to resist, resist, resist at all costs ... It wasn\u2019t always this way. President Trump is simply asking Democrats to support border security policies they all supported just a few short years ago. It\u2019s time for Democrats to put down their swords and work with President Trump. One-time Trump critic and current Trump ally Lindsay Graham praises the speech on Fox News. The New York Times has a full fact-check of Trump\u2019s speech here. So far they have found one false statement and quite a few that need context. Congressman Justin Amash of Michigan weighs in and is just as impressed with the remarks tonight as everyone else One of the top Democrats in the House has his own response to the speech on Twitter As the Democratic response ends, a number of observers have the same take on Schumer and Pelosi. Schumer ends by trying to blame the shutdown on Trump, a reverse of the argument offered by the president. \u201cSo our suggestion is a simple one: Mr. President: re-open the government and we can work to resolve our differences over border security. But end this shutdown now,\u201d said the top Senate Democrat. Schumer starts by emphasizing the Democratic message: My fellow Americans, we address you tonight for one reason only: the President of the United States \u2013 having failed to get Mexico to pay for his ineffective, unnecessary border wall, and unable to convince the Congress or the American people to foot the bill \u2013 has shut down the government. Pelosi ends her remarks by saying: The fact is: the women and children at the border are not a security threat, they are a humanitarian challenge \u2013 a challenge that President Trump\u2019s own cruel and counterproductive policies have only deepened. And the fact is: President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis, and must re-open the government. Pelosi starts by saying: \u201cMuch of what we have heard from President Trump throughout this senseless shutdown has been full of misinformation and even malice.\u201d NBC\u2019s Katy Tur, the author of the best-selling book Unbelievable, about the Trump campaign, has this analysis: Maggie Haberman from the New York Times has some initial analysis Trump is now sharing a number of stories of gruesome crimes committed by undocumented immigrants inside the United States. Trump now takes a different tone: Why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences and gates around their homes? They don\u2019t build walls because they hate the people on the outside but because they love the people on the inside. Trump is now blaming the shutdown on Democrats, saying they \u201cwill not fund border security\u201d. As Trump speaks, Stormy Daniels is currently folding her laundry on Instagram as Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cwe are never getting back together\u201d plays in the background. Trump says that \u201cat the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier and not a concrete wall\u201d and insists \u201cthe border wall would very quickly pay for itself.\u201d Trump talks of \u201cthe cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end\u201d in justifying his border wall. Trump warns of heroin flooding from the southern border. He calls the situation a crisis. Talking Points Memo reports that Senate Republicans are increasingly open for Trump to declare a national emergency to build a wall. It\u2019s not because they think it would work but simply because it would end the shutdown even if Trump\u2019s action gets overturned in the courts. As we wait for the speech to start, newly-elected Republican congressman Dan Crenshaw has tweeted his thoughts about the showdown. We are 20 minutes away from President Donald Trump addressing the nation about his border wall and the government shutdown. We\u2019ll be following the speech, the response and the reaction here. We\u2019re pausing this blog for now. We\u2019ll be back later this evening with live coverage of Trump\u2019s address at 9pm ET. Here\u2019s where things stand: Donald Trump is not expected to declare a national emergency in his speech from the Oval Office tonight. Here are six things to know beforehand. The Democratic response to Trump\u2019s speech will come from Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer tonight. After their response, there will be separate responses from both Bernie Sanders and Rep. Ted Lieu. Paul Manafort shared Trump polling data with a Russian intelligence asset according to a poorly redacted court filing. Democrats unveiled gun control legislation on Capitol Hill today. Stormy Daniels will be offering her own counter-programming to Trump\u2019s televised address to the nation tonight. Mike Pence has been a key emissary between the Trump administration and Capitol Hill during the shutdown. However, as the Atlantic reports, just because Pence is vice president doesn\u2019t mean that people think he speaks for Trump. The result is that Pence has been ineffective and is not viewed as a reliable messenger for the White House\u2019s position. According to one veteran House Republican aide, it was almost always a \u201cgiven\u201d that when former Vice President Joe Biden communicated the White House\u2019s agenda to the Hill, Barack Obama would be quick to follow through. Conversely, when Pence communicates the president\u2019s position, \u201cit ends up being accurate maybe 50 percent of the time.\u201d When a president deals more in \u201cspontaneity\u201d than in specificity, the aide added, legislative talks are bound to break down. The Senate is now at 100 members as former Florida governor Rick Scott has been sworn in to represent the Sunshine State on Capitol Hill. Scott delayed taking his oath to serve the final five days of his gubernatorial term. The delay though dropped him three slots in seniority and leaves him the most junior senator in the chamber. Mitt Romney\u2019s critical op-ed about Donald Trump in the Washington Post has upset a number of his new Republican colleagues. Politico reports that Senate Republicans were taken back at Romney\u2019s criticism just before he was sworn in to be Utah\u2019s junior senator. Sen. David Perdue of Georgia, a close Trump ally, dismissed Romney\u2019s op-ed as an \u201cattempted character assassination\u201d and \u201cdeeply disappointing,\u201d dubbing Romney a potential \u201cJeff Flake on steroids\u201d in his own Washington Post op-ed. Most Senate Republicans won\u2019t go that far, but they aren\u2019t particularly happy about how Romney chose to enter office. \u201cEverybody\u2019s got their strategy and their tactic. Mine is going to be to try and help the president and our country be successful. Mitt\u2019s got a different take,\u201d Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, a fellow freshman, said. \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to anybody that\u2019s encouraged by\u201d his approach. \u201cThe timing was kind of curious,\u201d said new Senate Majority Whip John Thune of South Dakota, who said Romney\u2019s gravitas as a former GOP presidential nominee gives everything he says extra weight. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have advised him to do it right now.\u201d Billionaire Tom Steyer \u201cwill make an announcement concerning his political plans for 2019 and beyond\u201d in Iowa tomorrow. Steyer who has been perhaps the largest single donor to progressive political causes in recent years has been mulling a presidential campaign. Bernie Sanders will give his own response to the State of the Union after Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer do so tonight. The Washington Post reports that Trump is not expected to declare a national emergency in his speech tonight. There had been speculation that Trump would attempt to do so in a desperate attempt to force wall construction without congressional authorization. And a senior White House official with knowledge of the speech said the plan is not to call for a national emergency but to further build a public case for the wall. \u201cIt will not be that drastically different than what the president has said so far, but it\u2019s to a bigger and different audience,\u201d said the official, who requested anonymity to share plans that have not been made public. A new court filing by Paul Manafort failed to redact key information and revealed that he shared polling data from the Trump campaign with Konstantin Kilimnik, who is believed to be a Russian intelligence agent. The redactions were in a court filing in which Manafort blamed ill health for any inconsistent statements that he made to federal prosecutors and not a deliberate effort to obfuscate. Alright folks, that\u2019s it from Sabrina ... I\u2019m now signing off and handing over the keys to my trusted colleague Ben Jacobs, who will take you right up to Trump\u2019s televised address and break down everything in between. Stay tuned! As the president prepares to declare a \u2018crisis\u2019 along the US-Mexico border, his 2020 re-election campaign is giving us a preview of what\u2019s in store ... and raising money off of it in the process. An email from Trump to supporters reads: \u201cI want to make one thing clear to Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi: Your safety is not a political game or a negotiation tactic!\u201d It then goes on to ask for donations and emphasizes the need to raise $500,000 in one day for what is billed as the \u2018Official Secure the Border Fund\u2019. (Spoiler: It\u2019s really just the re-elect Donald Trump fund.) Secretary of state Mike Pompeo meanwhile said he has seen Trump\u2019s prepared remarks and expects the president to make \u201ca lot of news\u201d. It almost seems likes this entire spectacle is designed to take over the news cycle. This seems a more apt take of what\u2019s really going on: House Democrats on Tuesday will introduce legislation to expand background checks on firearm sales, giving national attention once more to the polarizing issue of America\u2019s gun laws. The bill will be introduced by House speaker Nancy Pelosi, Representative Mike Thompson, the head of a task force aimed at reducing gun violence, and former Representative Gabby Giffords, who was shot in the head in a 2011 mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona. The proposal will require background checks on almost all commercial sales, including private sales at gun shows, as well as on other transfers. Its goal is to close many of the well-known loopholes in the federal background checks system that gun control advocates say have enabled those with criminal or mental health histories to obtain a firearm. While the measure will likely have broad support among Democrats, and would easily pass the House under their newfound majority, it will almost certainly be blocked by the Republican-controlled Senate. Democrats in the Senate plan to introduce companion legislation to complement the House bill. Anti-gun violence advocates nonetheless hailed the introduction of the bill as a major step forward after years of inaction on Capitol Hill. The Guardian\u2019s Lois Beckett has more here. 2020 Watch: Kamala Harris, the senator from California, released her memoir on Tuesday titled The Truths We Hold: An American Journey. The book chronicles Harris\u2019 upbringing as the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, her unexpected rise in US politics and current policy vision for the country. One anecdote making the rounds from Harris\u2019 book details the time she phoned John Kelly, then the secretary of the department of homeland security, at his home to inquire about Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries. Kelly, according to Harris\u2019 account, was less than receptive to her call. \u201cThere were a lot of ways Secretary Kelly could have shown responsiveness, a lot of information he could have provided,\u201d Harris writes. \u201cIndeed the American people had a right to this information, and, given my oversight role on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, I intended to get it. Instead, he said gruffly, \u201cWhy are you calling me at home with this?\u201d That was his chief concern. By the time we got off the phone, it was clear that he didn\u2019t understand the depth of what was going on. He said he\u2019d get back to me, but he never did.\u201d Although it\u2019s widely considered to be a platform for Harris to launch a presidential campaign, the senator told NPR while promoting the memoir that she was \u201cnot prepared to make any announcement at the moment\u201d. Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who attended the infamous June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower during the presidential campaign, has been charged by US authorities with obstruction of justice. The indictment, which was unsealed on Tuesday by the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, is separate from the special counsel investigation of Russian interference in the US election and potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. The Guardian\u2019s Jon Swaine reports: Natalia Veselnitskaya is accused of fabricating evidence in a US money-laundering case she was working on when she visited Trump Tower in June 2016 to meet senior Trump advisers including his son Donald Jr and son-in-law Jared Kushner. Federal prosecutors in New York said on Tuesday that Veselnitskaya and a senior Russian official drafted a bogus investigation report that she presented in court as supposed evidence that exonerated her client, Prevezon. The US attorney in Manhattan, Geoffrey Berman, said in a statement that acts like Veselnitskaya\u2019s \u201cundermines the integrity of the judicial process\u201d and threatens the enforcement of justice. Read the full story here. It\u2019s safe to say we know what to expect from both Donald Trump and Democrats in their back-to-back Tuesday night speeches on the government shutdown. But where does the American public stand? According to a new CNN analysis, not with the president. An average of polls found that roughly half of Americans think Trump is to blame for the shutdown -- the third under his watch -- while just 35% fault congressional Democrats. About 5% think Republicans in Congress are most to blame, which is not particularly surprising given their newfound minority in the House of Representatives. Given Trump is at the helm of the Republican Party, the average taken together shows 55% believe the president and Republicans are to blame. Trump\u2019s approval rating stands at just 41%, further weakening his leverage in the fight. Meanwhile, an overwhelming 70% of Americans want the president to reach a compromise with Congress, according to a separate poll released by The Hill-HarrisX on Monday. The latter survey also found that only Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters stand with him on his demand for a wall along the US-Mexico border. Get ready for Chuck and Nancy. The official Democratic response to Donald Trump\u2019s televised address to the nation will be delivered by Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. The move by Democrats to offer a rebuttal came after all major US networks and news channels heeded the White House\u2019s request to carry Trump\u2019s remarks live. In a joint statement on Monday, Schumer and Pelosi called for Democrats to be given equal airtime. The networks subsequently agreed. It was not immediately clear who would deliver the counter-speech on behalf of Democrats, but it was confirmed on Tuesday that it will be none other than Schumer and Pelosi themselves. The two leaders will speak to cameras from the US Capitol. Negotiations between the White House and Democrats in Congress over reopening the government remained at a standstill this week. Democrats have maintained they will not support any legislation that allocates funding toward Trump\u2019s border wall. The president has meanwhile refused to budge from his demand that the wall be built. Little is expected to change following Tuesday\u2019s dueling speeches to the American public. Speaking of presidential addresses, the decision by networks and cable news channels to carry Trump\u2019s speech live has been met with criticism from some corners. Given the political nature of the president\u2019s argument -- and the likelihood that his remarks will be replete with false or misleading claims -- some lashed out at the networks for giving Trump the airtime simply because he requested it. Late night host Seth Meyers joined the chorus, stating in his show on Monday that the president \u201cwants a primetime address to repeat his lies\u201d. \u201cFirst of all, just because Trump wants to address the nation doesn\u2019t mean networks should air it,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cOtherwise, they\u2019re just passing on his lies unfiltered. They should either reject him outright, or if he insists on speaking in primetime, make him do it as a contestant on The Masked Singer.\u201d Others can\u2019t help but point out that when Barack Obama took to the airwaves to present his plan for comprehensive immigration reform in 2014, he was rebuffed by the major US television networks. (At the time, a network insider explained that the content of Obama\u2019s speech was \u201covertly political\u201d.) Some media reporters have said the Obama White House did not make a formal request at the time. Former Obama aides have countered they did not feel such a step was necessary. In any case, Trump\u2019s speech will be inherently political since its purpose is to defend his position in favor of a border wall in the midst of a government shutdown caused by an impasse over that precise demand. The networks have agreed to air a formal response by Democrats to lend balance to the debate. You may have heard Donald Trump claim that previous presidents told him they should have built a wall along the US-Mexico border. Here\u2019s the moment in all its glory: Well, you may not believe it, but it turns out literally none of Trump\u2019s living predecessors made any such statement. The offices of former Presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama have all publicly denied that a conversation about the merits of a border wall took place. Vice president Mike Pence, ever the faithful employee of his boss, struggled to explain the basis of Trump\u2019s claim in an interview with NBC\u2019s Today show on Tuesday. \u201cI know the president has said that was his impression from previous presidents,\u201d Pence said. \u201cI know I\u2019ve seen clips of previous presidents talking about the importance of border security and talking about the issue of illegal immigration.\u201d When pressed by NBC\u2019s Hallie Jackson on how that obviously differs from Trump\u2019s predecessors telling him they regretted not building a border wall, Pence again deflected: \u201cLook, honestly the American people want us to address this issue.\u201d It\u2019s too bad there\u2019s no \u2018Phone-a-Friend\u2019 option in live interviews. As Trump prepares for his first Oval Office address as president, it might be pertinent to take a trip down memory lane and revisit how his predecessors treated such moments. While it may be a rite of passage to address the nation from the iconic, oval-shaped room, the use of the Oval Office by presidents to make a primetime speech is an increasingly rare occurrence. And when the Oval Office is deployed for formal remarks, it typically connotes a major event that transcends political lines. Trump, of course, is planning a speech for expressly political motives. The president will make the case for building a wall along the US-Mexico border after Democrats rebuffed his demand in what ultimately led to the third government shutdown under Trump\u2019s watch. As the shutdown enters its 18th day, Trump is hoping the gravitas of the Oval Office will help bolster his unfounded claim that there is an \u2018emergency\u2019 at the border -- the solution to which just so happens to be none other than his promised wall. In 2010, Barack Obama used his first Oval Office address as president to lay out his response to the catastrophic BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. He returned to the format that same year to announce the end of US combat operations in Iraq and only once more, in 2015, to discuss terrorism. If we go even further back in history, the Oval Office has been used for such historic moments as John F Kennedy discussing the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 and Lyndon B. Johnson declaring in 1968 that he would not seek re-election. Richard Nixon famously announced his resignation as president from the Oval Office following the Watergate scandal in 1974. White House officials are billing Trump\u2019s speech to be roughly seven minutes in length. That is, of course, if he sticks to script ... which has not always been his forte. All of the major US networks and news channels will carry the president\u2019s remarks, which will be followed by a televised response from Democrats. So will it be history-in-the-making or just another episode of Trump\u2019s reality TV presidency? We\u2019ll find out at 9 p.m., but I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and say not much will change. Donald Trump will argue in a nationwide address on Tuesday that the US-Mexico border is in a state of \u201ccrisis\u201d that necessitates the wall he has long promised to build. The speech, which will mark Trump\u2019s first from the Oval Office as president, comes as about 800,000 federal workers remain without pay amid a partial shutdown of the US government. Key parts of the government shut down on 22 December 2018 after Democrats and Trump reached a gridlock over the president\u2019s demand for $5.7bn in funding for the border wall. Trump upped the ante this week by preparing to address the nation at 9pm on Tuesday. His remarks from the Oval Office will be carried by all major US broadcast networks and cable news channels. Previewing Trump\u2019s comments, the vice-president, Mike Pence, told reporters \u201cthere is a humanitarian and national security crisis\u201d at the border. \u201cThe passion you hear from President Trump, his determination to take this case to the American people, as he will tonight in his national broadcast from the Oval Office, comes from this president\u2019s deep desire to do his job to protect the American people,\u201d Pence added during an appearance on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America. Immigration experts argue otherwise, pointing out that the rate of illegal border crossings has been in decline over the past decade. Last year, the population of undocumented immigrants in the US reached a 12-year low. Trump is nonetheless seeking to gain political leverage over Democrats as the closure of the federal government entered its 18th day, making it the third-longest shutdown on record. Democrats have insisted they will not hedge on their opposition to the wall and will start passing legislation in the House of Representatives this week aimed at reopening parts of the government. The bills are expected to be blocked by Senate Republicans, who have so far supported the president in his quest for wall funding. Good morning everyone! Sabrina Siddiqui here, planning to take you through what promises to be yet another action-packed day. The big event: Donald Trump will deliver a primetime address laying out the justification (or so he says) for his promised wall along the US-Mexico border. The president\u2019s comments will come as the shutdown of the US government enters its 18th day. Democrats are meanwhile planning a rebuttal to Trump\u2019s speech, and suddenly it\u2019s starting to feel like the State of the Union came early this year. (That one actually is coming up on 29 January, but more on that later...) All of which is to say, watch this spot for key updates and analysis as the day goes on.",

      "bodyText": "It was supposed to be the perfect political portrait \u2013 the smiling family man prime minister with his beaming wife and kids. But the image on Scott Morrison\u2019s website had a rather obvious flaw \u2013 the leader of Australia had two left feet and a pair of Photoshopped shoes. The failed picture-doctoring attempt has gone viral on social media and has been dubbed #shoegate. The original photo has now been restored. A spokesman for Morrison said the prime minister did not request or authorise the Photoshopping. \u201cThe photo was doctored by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet without the knowledge of, or authorisation by, the PM or the PM\u2019s office,\u201d he said. Morrison tweeted a picture of his K Swiss trainers on Wednesday morning. \u201cMessage to my department (PM&amp;C): I didn\u2019t ask for the shoeshine, but if you must Photoshop, please focus on the hair (lack thereof), not the feet!\u201d Social media users have had fun with the idea. Some people want even more Photoshopping. \u201cPlease tell me people are currently working on Photoshopping alternative shoes right now? Flippers, clogs, Doc Martins??? #Shoegate\u201d Simon Mitchell wrote. In September last year, Morrison\u2019s office deleted a video from his social media accounts after discovering the accompanying hip-hop song contained explicit and derogatory lyrics. The 11-second clip from question time showed MPs raising their hands, set to the 1999 track Be Faithful by American rapper Fatman Scoop.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s football federation executives have finally met with the president of the Asian Football Confederation and Bahraini royal, Sheikh Salman al-Khalifa, more than 40 days after Hakeem al-Araibi was detained in Thailand. Al-Araibi is a Bahraini dissident who has lived in Australia for four years, and is a permanent resident with refugee status on the basis of his fear of persecution in Bahrain. The meeting is understood to have occurred at the AFC Asian Cup football championships in the United Arab Emirates, with FFA chair Chris Nikou expressing Australia\u2019s desire to have al-Araibi freed and returned. It follows weeks of criticism of the football bodies, as well as the international organisation Fifa, for an apparent lack of advocacy on behalf of the detained 26-year-old footballer. Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Marise Payne, announced a visit to Thailand on Wednesday afternoon. She said as part of her trip, she would \u201cadvocate for the safe return to Australia of Mr Hakeem Alaraibi, who is currently detained in Thailand. Mr Alaraibi was granted permanent residency by the Australian government in recognition of his status as a refugee.\u201d Both FFA and the AFC declined to comment on the Asian Cup meeting or the attendance of Sheikh Salman. When asked for further detail, FFA said it had been in contact with Australian officials since al-Araibi\u2019s detention. \u201cFFA confirms it has also held direct dialogue with senior officials from Fifa, AFC and the Football Association of Thailand,\u201d a spokesman said. The AFC said it was \u201cworking with Fifa and other stakeholders\u201d, and FFA said it \u201cremains in contact with the Australian government and continues to advocate for the release\u201d of al-Araibi. \u201cFFA requests the governments of Australia, Thailand and Bahrain to continue their efforts to enable the release of Mr Hakeem al-Araibi and to ensure his safe return to Australia in accordance with internationally recognised human rights conventions.\u201d Al-Araibi was detained at Bangkok airport in November on an erroneously-issued Interpol red notice which raised questions about the internal processes of Interpol, the Australian Federal Police, and the home affairs department. He is currently in a Bangkok prison while a Thai court assesses Bahrain\u2019s extradition request. He was recently told he could no longer use the phone, meaning his wife and family in Australia are unable to contact him. Al-Araibi\u2019s lawyers have lodged a citizenship application with Australia in an attempt to strengthen the country\u2019s ability to demand his return, but have not received a response. The Australian government has reportedly said it will consider offering a humanitarian visa to Saudi woman, Rahaf al-Qunun, who was also arrested in Bangkok this week and was facing deportation. The arrest of al-Araibi has drawn international condemnation and numerous human rights organisations and football groups are campaigning for his release. However Fifa, the AFC, and FFA have all been criticised for their muted responses or silence. The day after al-Araibi was arrested, senior executives of FFA met with Sheikh Salman, and tweeted a picture from the FFA account. A spokesman told Guardian Australia they were unaware of the situation at the time, but there has not been any apparent contact since, until the Asian Cup meeting. Yahya al-Hadid, of the Gulf Institute for Democracy and Human Rights (GIDHR) said the football community, particularly in Australia, had rallied behind al-Araibi alongside human rights defenders, but there were question marks around the larger bodies like Fifa. \u201cIf their relationship to Gulf states is affecting their responses, it raises the question: are they independent?\u201d he said. \u201cThe silence of Fifa is concerning \u2026 also the silence of the AFC and its president. Don\u2019t they have ethical rights and responsibilities to protect their members?\u201d Former Socceroos captain and football commentator, Craig Foster, likened the situation to a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of football politics, with no one apparently willing to ruffle feathers ahead of two elections in 2019 \u2013 for the AFC and Fifa leaderships. Sheikh Salman is seeking reelection to the AFC presidency, and FFA chair Nikou is seeking a place on the AFC executive committee. Sheikh Salman is a member of the Bahraini royal family and was specifically criticised by al-Araibi in media interviews in 2016 for his lack of assistance when he and other Bahraini athletes were targeted. The athletes were caught up in a crackdown on pro-democracy protests during the Arab Spring. Al-Araibi was tried and convicted in absentia in a trial which was clouded by accusations of coerced confessions and the ignoring of key evidence. \u201cHis own government is requesting the extradition of the player, he\u2019s part of the royal family and clearly has great sway there and yet to date \u2026 appears to have done absolutely nothing to advocate for Hakeem\u2019s rights,\u201d Foster said last month.",

      "bodyText": "The EU has been strongly criticised over conditions in Greece\u2019s largest refugee camp, where Oxfam reported women are wearing nappies at night for fear of leaving their tents to go to the toilet. The British-based NGO described the increasingly dangerous state of the EU-sponsored Moria camp on the island of Lesbos, where a 24-year-old man from Cameroon was found dead in the early hours of Tuesday as temperatures fell below freezing. Under a landmark deal agreed between the EU and Turkey in March 2016 to reduce the number of people arriving into the continent, refugees seeking asylum on Greek islands have been forbidden from leaving \u201chotspot\u201d camps to travel to the mainland. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, has hailed the deal as a success for thwarting smuggling gangs and reducing migratory flows. But as a result, about 15,000 men, women and children are stranded in Lesbos, Chios, Kos, Samos and Leros, the islands closest to Turkey. The report from Oxfam titled Vulnerable and Abandoned highlighted the failure of authorities at the Moria camp, where nearly 5,000 people live, to identify vulnerable refugees who are eligible for help. Since the resignation in November of the government-appointed doctor designated to make assessments of asylum seekers\u2019 wellbeing, Oxfam claimed these failed to take place for at least a month at Moria, which at times last year was home to three times the number of people it was designed for. As a result, Oxfam warned \u201cvulnerable people including survivors of torture and sexual violence are being housed in unsafe areas \u2026 Pregnant women and mothers with newborns are left sleeping in tents, and unaccompanied children, wrongly registered as adults, have been placed in detention.\u201d Mothers are said to have been sent away from hospital to live in a tent as early as four days after giving birth by caesarian section, in a camp where fights break out regularly and two-thirds of residents say they never feel safe. \u201cIn a few extreme cases, women say they have resorted to wearing diapers at night to avoid having to go to the toilet after dark,\u201d the report said. One woman, 36, from Cameroon, told Oxfam that people were randomly attacked at the camp. \u201cMoria is a dangerous place for women,\u201d she said. \u201cFights can start at any moment. At any moment you can expect a stone to your head, even if you\u2019re just walking to the toilet or to your tent \u2026 I live in the closed section for women who are alone, but after 11pm the door is open, and anyone can come in because there is no security guard at night. Safety is a big issue for us.\u201d A 24-year-old woman from Afghanistan said: \u201cIn the winter there is no warm water. We take showers over the toilet.\u201d Renata Rend\u00f3n, Oxfam\u2019s head of mission in Greece, said: \u201cIt is irresponsible and reckless to fail to recognise the most vulnerable people and respond to their needs. \u201cOur partners have met mothers with newborn babies sleeping in tents, and teenagers wrongly registered as adults being locked up. Surely identifying and providing for the needs of such people is the most basic duty of the Greek government and its European partners.\u201d Rend\u00f3n added: \u201cEuropean leaders have to face the fact that their current policy is perpetuating an inhumane reception system and putting refugees at risk. Rather than continuing to focus all their efforts on returning refugees to Turkey under the deal struck in 2016, EU member states should support Greece to improve conditions in the island camps and move people off the overcrowded islands and on to the mainland.\u201d People seeking asylum are normally expected to undergo vulnerability assessments soon after arrival on the islands, but the medical and psychosocial screenings at Moria have been described as cursory at best due to a \u201csevere shortage\u201d of staff. Oxfam reported that for \u201cmany months\u201d, there was just one doctor employed by the Greek government at the camp to assess the health conditions of as many as 2,000 new arrivals in one month, before the medic eventually quit. Even refugees identified as vulnerable and theoretically allowed to leave the islands are being trapped due to a lack of accommodation on the mainland, it is claimed. According to UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, more than 4,000 people eligible for transfer were stuck in Lesbos and Samos in November. The slow asylum application process is also said to be condemning families to years in the camps, where people live in tents without hot water and electricity during winter. \u201cDue to a lack of staff, many people who arrive now in Lesbos have their first asylum interview scheduled for 2020,\u201d Oxfam reported. For some, open fires are reportedly the only way to keep warm in winter. The burning of plastic bags and bottles is said to create a \u201cdangerous, smoky, acrid atmosphere\u201d. Three asylum seekers died of carbon monoxide poisoning in the camp in January 2017 while trying to stay warm with makeshift stoves. Since September, about 11,000 asylum seekers have been transferred by ferry and coach to hotels and apartments on the mainland in an EU-funded scheme overseen by UNHCR. Stella Nanou, a spokesperson for the agency in Athens, said: \u201cWhile efforts have been intensified to transfer people and Moria\u2019s population has fallen below 5,000 for the first time since April last year, it is still twice over capacity. \u201cThere are people, vulnerable people, families and children, living in totally unsuitable conditions in the biting cold.

      "bodyText": "People who experienced sexual, physical or emotional abuse as children are two to three times more likely to kill themselves as adults, new research has found. Experts said the findings confirmed the \u201cdevastating effects\u201d of child abuse on mental wellbeing, while one suicide charity said 70% of people who had either tried to take their own life or who had thought about it had been abused. People who were sexually abused as a child were three times more likely than others to try to kill themselves, according to the new study in Psychological Medicine. And people who were either physically or emotionally abused or neglected in childhood were two and a half times more likely to try to end their lives. The findings come from research undertaken by academics at the University of Manchester and South Wales University, who analysed the results of 68 previous studies on the subject from around the world. Dr Maria Panagioti, from Manchester University who led the research, said about \u201cone adult in every three has experienced abuse as a child. This study conclusively gives us solid evidence that childhood abuse and neglect is associated with increased likelihood that they will be at risk of suicide as adults.\u201d The authors said the paper was the most comprehensive review of the evidence underlying the issue. The 68 studies were based on the experiences of 216,600 adults in countries including the US, Canada and Italy, while two of the studies were from the UK. The paper said: \u201cWe conclude that there is solid evidence that childhood maltreatment is associated with increased odds for suicidality in adults. \u201cAll types of childhood abuse are associated with increased risk for suicide attempts and suicidal ideation in adults independent of demographic, clinical and methodological variations across the studies.\u201d Men and women were equally likely to think about suicide or act on suicidal impulses, while the risk of suicide rose as the person aged, they found. Those not in contact with mental health services were at the greatest risk. Dr Bernadka Dubicka, the chair of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: \u201cThis study confirms the long-term and devastating effects of child abuse. \u201cPsychiatrists working on the frontline of mental health care witness the damage this causes to children, adolescents and adults on a daily basis.\u201d Many children cannot get help early in their lives both to prevent them suffering abuse and and to start to recover from its consequences, she added. Ged Flynn, the chief executive of the charity Papyrus, which works to prevent young people taking their own lives, said: \u201cIt is no surprise to us that this study shows that historical abuse contributes to some people experiencing thoughts of suicide. \u201cAround 70% of calls to our helpline cite childhood abuse of various sorts, some of which are still current.
