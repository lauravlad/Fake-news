The bill is thought to be legally watertight, and it seems to have closed off the option of Johnson forcing a no-deal Brexit at the end of October - a threat he claims has to be on the table if the EU is to offer him the compromise he insists he can obtain. Johnson has said that he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than demand an article 50 extension and no one seems to know (including perhaps Johnson himself?) what will happen if he gets to 19 October - the Saturday after the October EU summit, and the deadline in the bill for sending a letter requesting a Brexit deal - and the law says he must request an extension. Johnson can only avoid this condition either by getting MPs to pass a withdrawal agreement, or by getting them to vote to agree to a no-deal Brexit. The latter will never happen, and the former (on the basis of what we know say far about the UK-EU renegotiation) seems a remote possibility. The bill means MPs will have recourse to the courts if Johnson were to refuse to request an extension, but quite how this might play out in practice is not clear.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/opposition-parties-agree-block-snap-election-until-brexit-delay-secured\">Opposition parties have agreed to reject Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to trigger a snap election for a second time on Monday, making it increasingly unlikely a poll will be held before 31 October.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/boris-johnson-will-use-powers-persuasion-win-new-brexit-deal\">Boris Johnson has said he will win a new Brexit deal at next month\u2019s EU summit by using his \u201cpowers of persuasion\u201d, and rejected calls for a further extension to article 50.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/criticism-grows-boris-johnson-use-police-officers-political-speech\">West Yorkshire police have criticised Boris Johnson for making a political speech before a backdrop of its officers, with the chief constable saying the force was assured this would not happen but that Downing Street changed plans at the last minute.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/boris-johnson-prorogation-of-parliament-is-lawful-high-court-rules\">The legal campaigner Gina Miller has vowed to continue her \u201cfight for democracy\u201d after the high court in London ruled that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks was legal.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/gauke-johnson-risks-millions-of-votes-with-farage-lite-strategy\">Boris Johnson\u2019s divisive strategy risks turning the Conservatives into a \u201cFarage-lite\u201d party that will alienate millions of traditional Tory voters, the former justice secretary David Gauke has warned.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>James Cleverly, the Conservative party chair, has been branded \u201cchildish\u201d by one of his predecessors, Sayeeda Warsi, after he promoted a Tory advert branding Jeremy Corbyn a chicken for not agreeing to an early election.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SayeedaWarsi/status/1169966320743538689\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This James is silly playground behaviour.<br>We are in the middle of a national crisis and this is our response.\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f<br>How can grown men reduce themselves to this level of silliness.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I want [the election] to happen as soon as is practically possible, but I want us to secure the safety of not crashing out. It\u2019s balancing these things.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked when it would be a good time to hold an election, he dodged the question. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As soon as is practically possible ... It\u2019s going to happen over the course of the next few weeks. We will choose the timing of that because Boris Johnson has lost his majority in parliament. The opposition parties are now effectively in control. Boris Johnson is not going to bounce us into a situation of his choosing. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>One option for the opposition parties would be to use a no confidence motion to try to bring down Johnson\u2019s government. Blackford said he would like such a vote to go ahead but if it happened this week and was successful, the fact that parliament is being prorogued could stop the opposition parties being able to use the 14 days available under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act to form a new government. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I would like us to have a motion of no confidence as soon as is practically possible. The problem we\u2019ve got is that we are going into prorogation next week. Even if we had a vote of no confidence, there is then a 14-day period when a government has to be put in place. Parliament is not sitting. So there are risks ...</p> \n   <p>I would like a vote of no confidence provided we could control the process. But because of the prorogation of parliament, it\u2019s impossible to guarantee that. So we have to be careful that we don\u2019t walk into a trap.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13de2239ae4361fb8ab76dfc576c2fdc48fd6b97\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13de2239ae4361fb8ab76dfc576c2fdc48fd6b97/33_0_892_535/500.jpg\" alt=\"Ian Blackford\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-06T09:38:53.182Z\">at 10.38am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7216788f082514879eef36\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-06T08:46:36.552Z\">9.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Michael Fallon to stand down at next election</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Sir Michael Fallon</strong>, the former defence secretary, has joined the longish list of Tories who have decided to stand down at the next election.

Asked if there would be a \u201cno\u201d from Labour on Monday, she replied: \u201cYes.\u201d She explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The problem that we have is that the motion that the government has put before, and it looks like will put again, is a motion under the Fixed-term Parliament Act under clauses 2 (7) and 3 of the Fixed-term Parliament Act, if we vote to have a general election, then no matter what it is that Boris Johnson promises, it is up to him to advise the Queen when the general election should be. And given that he has shown himself to be a manifest liar, and someone who has said that he will die in a ditch rather than stop no deal, and indeed his adviser, [Dominic] Cummings, has been swearing and shouting at MPs saying they are leaving on 31 [October] no matter what, our first priority has to be that we must stop no deal and we must make sure that that is going to happen.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In Labour there are different views on exactly when an early election should take place, and there is as yet no settled view. Yesterday John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, hinted that his preference was to \u201cgo long\u201d. Asked if she thought Labour should wait until after the EU summit in mid October, and until after an article 50 extension has been agreed, Thornberry replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m not going to go into details. But my instinct on this is the same as John\u2019s.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Labour\u2019s position is crucial because, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, a vote for an early election only gets implemented if two thirds of MPs in the House of Commons (434) vote for it. Following the rebellion on Tuesday, which led to 21 Tories losing the whip, Johnson now only has 289 seats in the Commons.</p> \n  <p>We should be getting reaction from Boris Johnson later this morning.</p> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> \n  <p><em>Around 9am: </em>Boris Johnson visits a farm in Scotland where he will announce extra funding for Scottish farmers.<br></p> \n  <p><em>10am:</em> Jeremy Corbyn is due to hold a conference call with other opposition party leaders to discuss tactics on avoiding a no-deal Brexit and on the timing of a general election.</p> \n  <p><em>10am:</em> Judges at the high court may announce their decision in the legal challenge against the government\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament.</p> \n  <p><em>10am:</em> Peers resume their debate on the Benn bill, intended to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.

      "bodyText": "A bill designed to stop Boris Johnson taking the UK out of the EU on 31 October without a Brexit agreement has cleared the House of Lords, and it is set to become law on Monday when it is due to get royal assent. The bill, drafted over the summer by a cross-party alliance of MPs and tabled by Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, got through all its stages in the Lords in two days, without any amendments being passed. The bill is thought to be legally watertight, and it seems to have closed off the option of Johnson forcing a no-deal Brexit at the end of October - a threat he claims has to be on the table if the EU is to offer him the compromise he insists he can obtain. Johnson has said that he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than demand an article 50 extension and no one seems to know (including perhaps Johnson himself?) what will happen if he gets to 19 October - the Saturday after the October EU summit, and the deadline in the bill for sending a letter requesting a Brexit deal - and the law says he must request an extension. Johnson can only avoid this condition either by getting MPs to pass a withdrawal agreement, or by getting them to vote to agree to a no-deal Brexit. The latter will never happen, and the former (on the basis of what we know say far about the UK-EU renegotiation) seems a remote possibility. The bill means MPs will have recourse to the courts if Johnson were to refuse to request an extension, but quite how this might play out in practice is not clear. Opposition parties have agreed to reject Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to trigger a snap election for a second time on Monday, making it increasingly unlikely a poll will be held before 31 October. Boris Johnson has said he will win a new Brexit deal at next month\u2019s EU summit by using his \u201cpowers of persuasion\u201d, and rejected calls for a further extension to article 50. West Yorkshire police have criticised Boris Johnson for making a political speech before a backdrop of its officers, with the chief constable saying the force was assured this would not happen but that Downing Street changed plans at the last minute. The legal campaigner Gina Miller has vowed to continue her \u201cfight for democracy\u201d after the high court in London ruled that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks was legal. Boris Johnson\u2019s divisive strategy risks turning the Conservatives into a \u201cFarage-lite\u201d party that will alienate millions of traditional Tory voters, the former justice secretary David Gauke has warned. James Cleverly, the Conservative party chair, has been branded \u201cchildish\u201d by one of his predecessors, Sayeeda Warsi, after he promoted a Tory advert branding Jeremy Corbyn a chicken for not agreeing to an early election. Boris Johnson called David Cameron a \u201cgirly swot\u201d in unredacted government papers obtained by Sky News. In a note about proroguing parliament, Johnson said: \u201cThe whole September session is a rigmarole introduced by girly swot Cameron and show the public that MPs are earning their crust.\u201d Labour\u2019s Alison McGovern says Johnson\u2019s language says something about his attitude to women. Bankers bonuses could be banned in Britain in order to tackle high levels of inequality across the country, John McDonnell has said. The government is to review the provision and funding of special needs education for children in England, after the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, admitted that many families faced struggles as a result of the government\u2019s reforms. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. This is from Naomi Smith, chief executive of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, commenting on the Benn bill passing the Lords. The Lords have guided Britain further away from the no-deal cliff edge towards which the PM has been stumbling blindly. Parliament has forced Boris Johnson into a corner and his reckless Brexit strategy is in tatters. He must now uphold democratic process and formally seek this extension or face the courts. If you want to read the Hansard with today\u2019s House of Lords debate on the Benn bill, it\u2019s here. Here is a House of Lords library note (pdf) explaining what the Benn bill actually does. And there is a shorter summary here. And this is from the Lib Dem leader in the Lords, Dick Newby. Despite cynical attempts from Tory backbenchers to filibuster, the article 50 extension bill has seen safe passage through the House of Lords. It seems that - unlike our suitcases - their threats of disruption were empty. Liberal Democrats in both the Lords and the Commons have fought tirelessly against the attempts by the prime minister to force a disastrous no-deal Brexit, and this bill is an important step towards trying to sort out the mess the government has made. This is from the Labour peers\u2019 Twitter account. The Benn bill, intended to prevent a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, has just been approved by the House of Lords. It passed the upper house without being amended, which means that it does not have to go back to the House of Commons. It will become law as soon as it gets royal assent, which should happen on Monday. There were two votes earlier today, on Brexiter amendments intended to sabotage the bill, but they were easily defeated \u2013 by 268 votes to 47, and by 283 votes to 28. Earlier in the week a group of Tory Brexiter peers tried to filibuster a motion designed to allow the bill to clear the Lords by the end of today. But they backed down after dragging out a debate past 1am on Wednesday night/Thursday morning after the opposition parties agreed not to use guillotine motions. Some polling quoted in a Financial Times story (paywall) by Jim Pickard helps to explain why Labour might be keen to delay the election until November. If Johnson were to go to the polls after 31 October without having delivered Brexit, support for the Brexit party would double, the poll suggests. Pickard writes: An ICM poll suggests that support for the Brexit party would double from 9 per cent to 18 per cent if an election takes place after Halloween. The poll, commissioned by Represent Us \u2014 which is pushing for a second Brexit referendum \u2014 found the Conservatives\u2019 lead over Labour would evaporate in those circumstances. The ICM poll suggests the Tories would beat Labour by 37 per cent against 30 per cent in an October election, while the two parties would be neck and neck on 28 per cent in a November poll. We have already quoted extensively from what Boris Johnson said when he spoke to reporters at the farm in Aberdeen, but here are three more lines from him. They are from his interview with Sky News. Johnson claimed it would be possible to do a trade deal with the US that would cover beef without allowing American hormone-treated meat in to the UK. Talking about the opportunities available to the UK after Brexit, he said: Look at fantastic Scottish beef, which I\u2019ve just been looking at. Not a morsel of it currently goes to America. You could do a a free trade deal with America where you don\u2019t import their hormone-treated beef, but you do a deal on high-quality products, you allow Scottish farmers to sell, to discover new markets around the world. He claimed Jeremy Corbyn was making a mistake in refusing to back an early election. He said: I think it is the most sensational paradox. Never in history has there been an opposition party that has been given the chance to have an election and has turned it down. If I may say so, I think that they are making an extraordinary political mistake. But it\u2019s their decision. (Why Johnson would want an early election if it was also advantageous to Labour to have one was not explained.) He said the government was set to unveil a \u201cgolden age of infrastructure investment\u201d. He said: When global interest rates are so low, this is is the moment to have golden age of infrastructure investment. That\u2019s what Sajid Javid set out in the spending review this week and in the budget this autumn you will be hearing a lot more about infrastructure, about improving our roads, our railways, doing fantastic things with full-fibre broadband across the whole country. Boris Johnson has said he will win a new Brexit deal at next month\u2019s EU summit by using his \u201cpowers of persuasion\u201d, and rejected calls for a further extension to article 50. The prime minister said he had no plans to accept the new legislation which would require him to write to the EU asking for a \u201cpointless\u201d delay to Brexit, during a visit to Aberdeenshire on Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a long time trying to sort of fudge this thing and I think the British public really want us to get out. They don\u2019t want more dither and delay,\u201d he said after encountering a prize bull called Keene at a beef farm near Banchory. Asked how he would deliver a new deal at the EU summit on 17 October, he said: By powers of persuasion. Because there\u2019s absolutely no doubt we should come out \u2026 It\u2019s a pointless delay. Scotland\u2019s highest civil court will not give its judgement before Wednesday on a challenge to the planned prorogation of parliament, the Press Association reports. The lord president, Lord Carloway, rejected an application to make an interim order to halt the process, despite hearing from the applicants that prorogation could be started two days before that, on Monday. He said the court had some extremely complex issues to decide, which would take some time, and it hoped to be in a position to give its judgement on Wednesday. Here is the ITV political editor Robert Peston\u2019s take on the election timing story. Here is my colleague Heather Stewart\u2019s story about what the opposition leaders at Westminster decided about an early election when they spoke this morning. And this is how it starts. Opposition parties have agreed to reject Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to trigger a snap election for a second time on Monday, making it increasingly unlikely a poll will be held before 31 October. Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, told the World at One that he believes the opposition parties have agreed not to support an early election until November. Labour did not explicitly say that in its readout of the meeting (see 12.52pm), but Brake was explicit. He said: We [the opposition parties] are not going to give the prime minister the election he is so desperate for until an extension has been secured and the risk of crashing out of the EU without a deal is completely eliminated. He said by \u2018extension being secured\u2019, he did not just mean the Hilary Benn bill, designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, becoming law. He meant Boris Johnson going to Brussels and securing that extension. And if [Johnson] chooses to disobey the law, and not follow what parliament has required him to do, then we have agreed that we will take all necessary action to enforce that. Asked if that meant there would be no election before 31 October, Brake said: Any election before 31 October runs the risk of us crashing out of the European Union and that would be completely irresponsible ... The opposition parties are very keen to have a general election. We just want it to be on 1 November or later than that. I\u2019m not quite sure why delay of a couple of weeks is so important to the prime minister. He\u2019s desperate for an election and presumably would be keen to have one after 31 October. Another Conservative MP from the mainstream, one nation, remain-voting wing of the party has announced that she is standing down. Claire Perry, 55, was energy minister, with the right to attend cabinet, until she left the government when Boris Johnson became prime minister. I say \u201cmainstream\u201d, but that adjective is probably misleading. MPs like Perry, Caroline Spelman, Nick Hurd, Alistair Burt and Nicholas Soames used to represent mainstream Conservatism. But the centre of gravity of the party has shifted dramatically since 2016, a process that has accelerated under Johnson\u2019s leadership, and now hardline Brexiter is the mainstream. Johnson would argue that it is possible to combine one nation Conservatism in relation to a domestic agenda with a firm commitment to Brexit, but the recent personnel changes in his party make that claim questionable. The Evening Standard has a useful list of all the MPs who have said they are standing down at the election. There were further hints that Boris Johnson seems fatigued and drained by the crisis bedevilling his government, after his brother Jo\u2019s resignation and the angry criticism of party grandees in the last 24 hours. The prime offered a curiously-phrased answer to a question about his own future during a 12-minute long press conference with newspaper reporters in Aberdeenshire, lacking his normally self-confident bounce and bluster. He was asked by the Guardian when he might resign, given he had won the Tory leadership with a pledge to unite the party and the country, yet had presided over deep splits in both. He answered: What I said was that we had to deliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. He was asked again: at what point do you think you might resign? Er \u2026 Well \u2026 I think after those three objectives have been accomplished I will \u2026 At some point after those three objectives have been accomplished. He had been up since before dawn, visiting Peterhead fish market soon after 6am after travelling to and from West Yorkshire yesterday. Prime ministers normally insist they have no intention of standing down, swatting aside any doubts about their future. He could claim to be tired. Labour has issued a statement about talks Jeremy Cobyn held this morning with other opposition party leaders about stopping a no-deal Brexit and about the timing of an election. The SNP and Plaid Cyrmu have both been implying there was an agreement not to hold an early election until November (see 12.07pm and 12.24pm), but the Labour statement does not go that far. A spokesman said: Jeremy Corbyn hosted a positive conference call with other opposition party leaders this morning. They discussed advancing efforts to prevent a damaging no deal brexit and hold a general election once that is secured. Boris Johnson gave a far less bullish response to questions about the Brexit crisis during a visit to a beef farm in Aberdeenshire on Friday morning, seeming more hesitant about seeking a delay to Brexit and the fate of his controversial adviser Dominic Cummings. After a dawn visit to Peterhead\u2019s fish market several hours earlier, Johnson seemed tired, making several attempts to answer questions and dropping the \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d rhetoric he used on Thursday. Asked to confirm that he would refuse to seek an extension to article 50 even if legally required to by the opposition bill now going through the Lords, he gave an ambiguous response in which he refused to explicitly confirm he would ignore the legislation. He cut short a sentence in which he appeared to be about to say he would not request an extension. He said: \u201cI will not ex \u2026 I don\u2019t want a delay.\u201d Pressed on a challenge by Sir John Major on Thursday night to sack Cummings, Johnson first failed to answer a direct question from one reporter, then refused to give his chief adviser explicit support when asked a second time. He answered: I \u2026 I \u2026 Look \u2026 Advisers, as I think someone said in the Commons the other day, advisers advise and ministers decide. On Thursday evening, Major made an implicit reference to Cummings in a speech to the CBI Scotland annual dinner: We have seen over-mighty advisers before. It is a familiar script. It always ends badly. I offer the prime minister some friendly advice: get rid of these advisers before they poison the political atmosphere beyond repair. And do it quickly. There is no need for them to be led out of Downing Street by armed police, but go they should. And now. Boris Johnson has been speaking to reporters in Scotland. My colleague Severin Carrell was there, and we will be covering everything he said shortly. Johnson told reporters that he would get a Brexit deal. But, as Severin points out, he also said at another point that part of him still \u201cyearns\u201d to believe that the Loch Ness monster exists \u2013 suggesting he has a weakness for believing in the impossible. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster, has just confirmed that in their conversation this morning the opposition party leaders agreed that guaranteeing an article 50 extension should take priority over calling an early election. (See 12.07pm.) She told BBC News: We need to make sure we get past the 31 October and an extension to article 50. In that respect, we were in agreement that the prime minister is on the run. Boris is broken. We have an opportunity to bring down Boris, to break Boris, and to bring down Brexit. And we must take that. Just as this week, the vote for a general election would play into Boris Johnson\u2019s hands. It would allow him to ignore the legislation that is currently going through the House of Lords, likely to have royal assent today. It would allow him to ignore that. It would give him the opportunity to ignore the law. Our duty, therefore, as parliamentarians who are intent on stopping no-deal Brexit is to be here in this place, to hold him to account, and to make sure that he abides by the law. This suggests the opposition parties want parliament to be sitting around the time of 19 October, which is when Johnson would have to write to the EU requesting a Brexit extension if by then there was niether a deal nor a vote in parliament to approve a no-deal Brexit. That would mean an election would not take place until November at the earliest. These are from Sky\u2019s Sam Coates From the Financial Times\u2019 Sebastian Payne The chief constable of West Yorkshire police, John Robins, has said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d to see his officers used as a backdrop to a party political event staged by Boris Johnson yesterday, something that had not been agreed in advance. In a statement, Robins said: I am pleased that we were chosen as the focal point of the national recruitment campaign launch, but the good news of extra officers was overshadowed by the media coverage of other events. It was the understanding of West Yorkshire police that any involvement of our officers was solely about police officer recruitment. We had no prior knowledge that the speech would be broadened to other issues until it was delivered. Minutes before the speech, we were told that [a planned visit to the National Police Air Service] and subsequent brief to a small media pool had been cancelled. I was therefore disappointed to see my police officers as a backdrop to the part of the speech that was not related to recruitment. After the disastrous speech, Johnson gave his own explanation to the Yorkshire Post about what happened. These are from the Yorkshire Post\u2019s Rob Parsons. Chuka Umunna, the former Labour MP who joined the Lib Dems this year, has announced that he plans to stand for his new party in The Cities of London &amp; Westminster at the next election, Joe Murphy reveals in the Evening Standard. As Murphy writes, this is \u201ca flagship [Conservative] seat that covers the City, Buckingham Palace and 10 Downing Street\u201d. The current MP, Mark Field, had a majority of 3,148 over Labour at the 2017 election. The Lib Dems were a poor third in that election, but in this year\u2019s European election they came top in the constituency. Umunna says he cannot stand again in his current constituency, Streatham, because the Lib Dems already have a candidate there. Standing for Labour in Streatham two years ago, Umunna had a majority of 26,285. There were three local council byelections yesterday. Here is a preview by Andrew Teale. And here are the results. Harriet Harman, the Labour former deputy leader and the chair of the joint committee on human rights, has joked that so many moderate Tories are being driven out of the party that she is thinking of holding an inquiry. Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks is legal, the high court in London has ruled, my colleague Owen Bowcott reports. Here is a question from below the line. I\u2019ll respond up here, because the answer might be of general interest. Emily Thornberry was referring specifically to this story by Jack Doyle and Jason Groves in the Daily Mail yesterday. This is how it starts. Boris Johnson\u2019s controversial enforcer warned a former cabinet minister he would be \u2018purged\u2019 if he stepped out of line on Brexit, Tory sources said last night. In an extraordinary phone rant, Dominic Cummings issued a direct threat to Greg Clark during a heated exchange ahead of Tuesday night\u2019s crunch vote allowing MPs to seize control of Commons business. A senior Tory source said Mr Cummings told former business secretary Mr Clark: \u2018When are you f***ing MPs going to realise we are leaving on October 31? We are going to purge you.\u2019 A second former minister confirmed the account, adding: \u2018This is the most reckless and vindictive handling of colleagues I have seen in my 20-odd years in parliament. It\u2019s a disaster \u2013 Cummings is out of control.\u2019 And here is another paragraph. Details of Mr Clark\u2019s phone call to Mr Cummings, confirmed by several sources, suggested it was made to discuss a possible compromise following a fractious meeting between rebels and Mr Johnson on Tuesday morning. The prime minister told Mr Clark to \u2018call Dom\u2019 to discuss the idea. But when he rang Mr Cummings, the PM\u2019s senior adviser is said to have opened the conversation with a brusque \u2018What do you want?\u2019 before launching into a rant and then hanging up. Like Labour, the Scottish National party will refuse to support Boris Johnson\u2019s proposed motion on Monday night calling for an early general election. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminister, told Sky\u2019s All Out Politics that his party wanted a general election, but did not trust Johnson to decide its timing. Blackford said: Boris Johnson doesn\u2019t have a majority in parliament so the idea that he is coming with a motion to try and force an election, having lost one this week, is insane. He is not going to compel parliamentarians to give him a mandate to determine the timing \u2013 we don\u2019t trust him. We\u2019ll determine the timing of this, not Boris Johnson. Like Emily Thornberry (see 9.01am), Blackford stressed the importance of ensuring the UK would not crash out of the EU on 31 October before allowing an election to take place. He said: I want [the election] to happen as soon as is practically possible, but I want us to secure the safety of not crashing out. It\u2019s balancing these things. Asked when it would be a good time to hold an election, he dodged the question. He said: As soon as is practically possible ... It\u2019s going to happen over the course of the next few weeks. We will choose the timing of that because Boris Johnson has lost his majority in parliament. The opposition parties are now effectively in control. Boris Johnson is not going to bounce us into a situation of his choosing. One option for the opposition parties would be to use a no confidence motion to try to bring down Johnson\u2019s government. Blackford said he would like such a vote to go ahead but if it happened this week and was successful, the fact that parliament is being prorogued could stop the opposition parties being able to use the 14 days available under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act to form a new government. He explained: I would like us to have a motion of no confidence as soon as is practically possible. The problem we\u2019ve got is that we are going into prorogation next week. Even if we had a vote of no confidence, there is then a 14-day period when a government has to be put in place. Parliament is not sitting. So there are risks ... I would like a vote of no confidence provided we could control the process. But because of the prorogation of parliament, it\u2019s impossible to guarantee that. So we have to be careful that we don\u2019t walk into a trap. Sir Michael Fallon, the former defence secretary, has joined the longish list of Tories who have decided to stand down at the next election. Fallon, 67, told the Today programme this morning that he was planning to stand down at the end of this parliament anyway, but he did express concerns about Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to purge the 21 Conservatives who rebelled against the government on Tuesday. He said he hoped they might have the whip restored. I would hope there would be some kind of appeal mechanism that they can find now so they get the chance to state their case. He also said the move sent out the wrong message to voters. I also worry that it sends the wrong message to remainers \u2013 particularly in my party. I think, by definition, some 5 million Conservatives must have voted remain and we have got to be very careful not to drive them into the hands of remainer parties like the Liberal Democrats in England or the Scottish nationalists in Scotland. Boris Johnson has been visiting Peterhead fish market in Scotland this morning. On the way out, he was doorstepped by Sky News, and asked if he accepted that Brexit might not happen. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get out,\u201d he said, complaining about more \u201cpointless delay\u201d. Those are the only words we\u2019ve got so far, but Sky did broadcast some pictures. Sadly, he does not seem to be wearing the coat bearing the label \u201cprime minister\u201d that saw its first outing on his last visit to Scotland. Perhaps it\u2019s been allocated instead to Dominic Cummings? On Wednesday, when MPs debated Boris Johnson\u2019s motion calling for an early election, Jeremy Corbyn said that Labour would be willing to vote for an election after the Hilary Benn bill intended to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October becomes law (which is due to happen by Monday). Corbyn said: I repeat what I said last night. Let this bill pass and gain royal assent, and then we will back an election\u2014so we do not crash out of the European Union with a no-deal exit. But, as we reported yesterday (eg see here and here), Corbyn has been coming under intense pressure from Labour MPs to delay the date of a possible early general election and this morning Emily Thornberry confirmed on the Today programme that, if Johnson goes ahead as planned with a second vote on an early election on Monday night, after the Benn bill has royal assent, Labour will still refuse to support the move. Asked if there would be a \u201cno\u201d from Labour on Monday, she replied: \u201cYes.\u201d She explained: The problem that we have is that the motion that the government has put before, and it looks like will put again, is a motion under the Fixed-term Parliament Act under clauses 2 (7) and 3 of the Fixed-term Parliament Act, if we vote to have a general election, then no matter what it is that Boris Johnson promises, it is up to him to advise the Queen when the general election should be. And given that he has shown himself to be a manifest liar, and someone who has said that he will die in a ditch rather than stop no deal, and indeed his adviser, [Dominic] Cummings, has been swearing and shouting at MPs saying they are leaving on 31 [October] no matter what, our first priority has to be that we must stop no deal and we must make sure that that is going to happen. In Labour there are different views on exactly when an early election should take place, and there is as yet no settled view. Yesterday John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, hinted that his preference was to \u201cgo long\u201d. Asked if she thought Labour should wait until after the EU summit in mid October, and until after an article 50 extension has been agreed, Thornberry replied: I\u2019m not going to go into details. But my instinct on this is the same as John\u2019s. Labour\u2019s position is crucial because, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, a vote for an early election only gets implemented if two thirds of MPs in the House of Commons (434) vote for it. Following the rebellion on Tuesday, which led to 21 Tories losing the whip, Johnson now only has 289 seats in the Commons. We should be getting reaction from Boris Johnson later this morning. Here is the agenda for the day. Around 9am: Boris Johnson visits a farm in Scotland where he will announce extra funding for Scottish farmers. 10am: Jeremy Corbyn is due to hold a conference call with other opposition party leaders to discuss tactics on avoiding a no-deal Brexit and on the timing of a general election. 10am: Judges at the high court may announce their decision in the legal challenge against the government\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. 10am: Peers resume their debate on the Benn bill, intended to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. It is due to finish all its stages in the Lords by 5pm. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "In a week filled with memorable political images \u2013 Boris Johnson\u2019s sideways glance at a fainting police officer, Sir Nicholas Soames blinking back tears after he was expelled from the Conservative party, or former minister Dr Phillip Lee unexpectedly crossing the floor of the House of Commons to join the Lib Dems \u2013 it was the image of a near-horizontal Jacob Rees-Mogg lounging across the front bench that lit up the internet. As a tense emergency debate which would affect the livelihoods of millions of people continued around him, the newly appointed leader of the house leaned back and stretched his legs across several seats, his left hand lolled across a besuited midriff. With MPs agonising over the gravity of the current political crisis, the member for Somerset North East nonchalantly closed his eyes and rested. For some MPs in the chamber on Tuesday night, it was the moment the man nicknamed \u201cthe honourable member for the 18th century\u201d lost any remaining anachronistic charm. Rees-Mogg had gained a reputation among some parliamentarians and the public as a winning curiosity. His politeness, deft use of parliamentary procedure and precise pronunciation of 29-letter words like floccinaucinihilipilification won over those who disliked his populist politics. During appearances on the BBC\u2019s Have I Got News For You and several magazine programmes, he is asked about his decision to campaign during an election alongside his nanny or to name his sixth child Sixtus. But his nonchalant posture enraged MPs on the opposition benches as they debated a plan to shut down parliament amid warnings of a wrecked economy and medicine shortages. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP for Brighton Pavilion, had watched Rees-Mogg slouching for at least an hour before she finally took him to task. \u201cThe leader of the house has been spread across three seats, lying out as if that was something very boring for him to listen to tonight,\u201d she said. Other MPs shouted \u201cSit up!\u201d and \u201cSit up straight!\u201d Looking both embarrassed and defiant, Rees-Mogg shook his head, before adjusting his glasses. But by this point, social media users across the globe who were watching the debate had begun to respond with dozens of creative memes. His posture was used to trace the decline of the government\u2019s majority from 17 to minus 43 or the rapid fall in value of the pound against the euro since 2016. The reclining Rees-Mogg was superimposed dancing with the 1980s ska band Madness, high-jumping the Fosbury flop and dropped on to the sofas of The Simpsons and Friends \u2013 renamed \u201cNo Friends\u201d. Those of an artistic bent compared his pose to Jacques-Louis David\u2019s the Death of Marat, Sir John Everett Millais\u2019 Ophelia and a sprawling upper class gentleman in Thomas Dugdale\u2019s Arrival of the Jarrow Marchers in London. Lucas said the public response to his unusual parliamentary pose has been magnified by the importance of the debate. \u201cIt does demonstrate an extraordinary confidence and a sense of entitlement if you literally take up far more social space than anyone else, and that manifested itself in looking so contemptuous of everyone else. I think he has suddenly learnt that what you can get away with on the backbench you cannot do on the frontbench. This is an image that is going to follow him for many years to come,\u201d she said. His performances at the dispatch box \u2013 he was accused of being dismissive of questions posed by remain-supporting colleagues \u2013 enraged some of the 21 Tory MPs who voted against the government that night. Soames told the Guardian: \u201cJacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s performance, his rudeness and casualness to colleagues, shows he just doesn\u2019t understand the way it works ... it was just bloody bad behaviour, you wouldn\u2019t see Andrea Leadsom lying about.\u201d Chris Bryant, the Labour MP for Rhondda and former deputy leader of the house of Commons, said Rees-Mogg\u2019s performance in the house has failed to take into consideration the government\u2019s weak position. \u201cThe thing about the leader of the house job, is you have to do it with a great deal of grace, especially when it\u2019s a minority government.

Rees-Mogg\u2019s week went from bad to worse on Thursday when he compared a consultant who helped draw up no-deal medical plans to the disgraced anti-vaxxer Andrew Wakefield. Rees-Mogg eventually apologised following pressure from Westminster colleagues and the chief medical officer of England, who said that the leader of the house\u2019s comments about the respected neurologist David Nicholl were \u201cdisrespectful\u201d. Rees-Mogg was elected to the Commons in 2010, but his profile rose considerably in the wake of the 2016 Brexit referendum when his calm performances in front of TV cameras led him to being seen as a possible future prime minister. Queues for his speeches at party conference snaked round buildings, and Moggmentum, an online conservative campaign and grassroots movement supporting him was created. The son of the former Times editor William Rees-Mogg, he dismissed questions last year about investment funds established in Ireland by Somerset Capital Management, a firm he co-founded. SCM had warned investors about the dangers of a hard Brexit as Rees-Mogg spoke out about \u201cscare stories from project fear\u201d. He has also refused to bow to mainstream views on abortion, which he opposes even in cases of rape. But Andrew Bridgen, the Eurosceptic MP and a close colleague of Rees-Mogg, said his difficult week should not detract from his talents. \u201cIt is clear that the opposition see him as a very capable and able leader of the house. They clearly want to get some hits on him because they see him as a threat in what has been a very bad week for the party. \u201cJacob was the darling of the Labour party when he was attacking May or Cameron. Now that Euroscepticism is mainstream he is the enemy. There is no politician I have met who is consistently more polite than Jacob.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s been a week since I got back from Minneapolis, where we were visiting my daughter and her husband, and the holiday already feels like something of a distant memory. I arrived back at Heathrow late in the morning and by the afternoon I was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/02/boris-takes-a-leaf-out-of-cummings-game-theory-for-dommies\">sketching Boris Johnson\u2019s press conference</a> at the G7 summit. Since then, politics has become progressively more mad: so much so it\u2019s even affecting my sleep. Last night I had a dream that I was crossing and recrossing the Irish border, petrified I was going to be stopped by guards. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s one I need to take to my shrink for interpretation. But the holiday was wonderful \u2013 the first time we had all been together as a family since last Christmas \u2013 with plenty of lazing around beside lakes as well as more energetic activities. The one downside, apart from the expense \u2013 the government\u2019s efforts to drive the pound towards parity with the dollar to simplify a US-UK trade deal did us no favours \u2013 was that we got to learn more about the workings of the American healthcare system than we anticipated after my wife broke her thumb playing softball. Just as well she had taken out insurance \u2013 though we never managed to reclaim the unused tokens at the baseball centre that another family stole from us while we were tending to my wife \u2013 as her treatment came to just short of $8,000 (\u00a36,500). Needless to say, on our return home, the doctors here said they would never have repaired the break with pins that large. It was like listening to one builder inspecting another\u2019s work.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>An extraordinary day in Westminster, which began with Johnson giving a statement on the G7, prorogation and the general election he said he didn\u2019t want but was clearly desperate for, and continued with Michael Gove giving a statement in which he refused to discuss the no-deal preparations outlined in Operation Yellowhammer on the grounds that they were top secret. Despite them having been leaked to the Sunday Times two weeks previously. Then came the emergency debate to prevent a no-deal Brexit, in which Jacob Rees-Mogg threw a temper tantrum, lay down on the front bench and demanded nanny bring him his bottle, and ended with Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/boris-johnson-suffers-commons-defeat-as-tories-turn-against-him\">losing his first vote</a> in the House of Commons as prime minister. As a result of which, 21 senior Tory MPs, including Ken Clarke, Philip Hammond, Justine Greening and Nicholas Soames were deselected. The man who considers himself a latter-day Churchill had just kicked Churchill\u2019s grandson out of the Conservative party. All the while, Johnson\u2019s key special adviser, Dominic \u201cDom and Dommer\u201d Cummings, was lurking in the background, Kool-Aid in hand and shouting at his shadow while trying to pretend everything was working out exactly as Classic Dom had planned. To cap it all, I received a press release saying David Icke was publishing a new book on the real truth behind September 11. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to distinguish between satire and reality. I\u2019m often asked if it\u2019s easier to be a sketch writer now that the absurd has become the norm. I actually find it increasingly difficult to see the funny side of anything. Rather I feel like I have become a stenographer failing to keep pace with events.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0635573e0cdbe482a034253f75a144a5f07fd520\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0635573e0cdbe482a034253f75a144a5f07fd520/0_40_2324_1394/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ken Clarke and Theresa May in House of Commons\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ken Clarke to Theresa May: \u2018He\u2019s even worse than you.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Taylor/UK Parliament/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s first prime minister\u2019s questions proved to be his second car crash in as many days. Most Tory MPs had assumed his hopeless performance at the dispatch box the previous day had just been an aberration and the man who had sold himself to them as the \u201cGreat Entertainer\u201d would live up to his reputation. If anything, he was even more hopeless. Too much more of this and Tories will be sending letters to the 1922 Committee demanding the return of Theresa May. At least she used to make an attempt at engaging with questions, even if she seldom provided any direct answers. Johnson merely alternated between mumbling and shouting, while insisting his Brexit negotiations would be going swimmingly once he actually got round to starting them and just making facts up to suit himself. He even insisted the Andrew Marr interview in which Gove admitted some food prices could go up \u2013 yippee, it\u2019s dog biscuits all round from November onwards \u2013 had never taken place. You\u2019d have thought someone with a long history of lying to his family and friends would be rather better at lying to parliament. Long before the end, you could see the desperation on the Conservative benches. Not even his fellow cabinet members could summon up much enthusiasm. One Tory MP sent me a simple text that read, \u201cHe is appalling\u201d. It was reported this week that Johnson\u2019s election slogan is likely to be \u201cTrust the people\u201d. A hard sell when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/cornered-boris-johnson-suffers-triple-commons-defeat\">not even his own MPs</a> trust him.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>One of the other great pleasures of going on holiday is the chance to sit down and read a book \u2013 The Great Romantic, Duncan Hamilton\u2019s biography of the Guardian cricket and music writer Neville Cardus, was an utter joy. I also love wandering around bookshops in the US to check out how different their bestseller charts are from ours in the UK. Apart from the usual rash of How to Get On in Business and Make a Fortune books, what struck me from going to Barnes &amp; Noble was the number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/12/dogs-tales-and-meowmoirs-the-irresistible-rise-of-endearing-animal-books\">titles about heroic dogs</a> that were in its top 20. I counted at least three. There was The Art of Racing in the Rain: Meet the Dog who will Show the World how to be Human, the story of how a pooch brought a family together and turned a bloke into a racing driver.

      "bodyText": "Monday It\u2019s been a week since I got back from Minneapolis, where we were visiting my daughter and her husband, and the holiday already feels like something of a distant memory. I arrived back at Heathrow late in the morning and by the afternoon I was sketching Boris Johnson\u2019s press conference at the G7 summit. Since then, politics has become progressively more mad: so much so it\u2019s even affecting my sleep. Last night I had a dream that I was crossing and recrossing the Irish border, petrified I was going to be stopped by guards. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s one I need to take to my shrink for interpretation. But the holiday was wonderful \u2013 the first time we had all been together as a family since last Christmas \u2013 with plenty of lazing around beside lakes as well as more energetic activities. The one downside, apart from the expense \u2013 the government\u2019s efforts to drive the pound towards parity with the dollar to simplify a US-UK trade deal did us no favours \u2013 was that we got to learn more about the workings of the American healthcare system than we anticipated after my wife broke her thumb playing softball. Just as well she had taken out insurance \u2013 though we never managed to reclaim the unused tokens at the baseball centre that another family stole from us while we were tending to my wife \u2013 as her treatment came to just short of $8,000 (\u00a36,500). Needless to say, on our return home, the doctors here said they would never have repaired the break with pins that large. It was like listening to one builder inspecting another\u2019s work. Tuesday An extraordinary day in Westminster, which began with Johnson giving a statement on the G7, prorogation and the general election he said he didn\u2019t want but was clearly desperate for, and continued with Michael Gove giving a statement in which he refused to discuss the no-deal preparations outlined in Operation Yellowhammer on the grounds that they were top secret. Despite them having been leaked to the Sunday Times two weeks previously. Then came the emergency debate to prevent a no-deal Brexit, in which Jacob Rees-Mogg threw a temper tantrum, lay down on the front bench and demanded nanny bring him his bottle, and ended with Johnson losing his first vote in the House of Commons as prime minister. As a result of which, 21 senior Tory MPs, including Ken Clarke, Philip Hammond, Justine Greening and Nicholas Soames were deselected. The man who considers himself a latter-day Churchill had just kicked Churchill\u2019s grandson out of the Conservative party. All the while, Johnson\u2019s key special adviser, Dominic \u201cDom and Dommer\u201d Cummings, was lurking in the background, Kool-Aid in hand and shouting at his shadow while trying to pretend everything was working out exactly as Classic Dom had planned. To cap it all, I received a press release saying David Icke was publishing a new book on the real truth behind September 11. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to distinguish between satire and reality. I\u2019m often asked if it\u2019s easier to be a sketch writer now that the absurd has become the norm. I actually find it increasingly difficult to see the funny side of anything. Rather I feel like I have become a stenographer failing to keep pace with events. Wednesday Boris Johnson\u2019s first prime minister\u2019s questions proved to be his second car crash in as many days. Most Tory MPs had assumed his hopeless performance at the dispatch box the previous day had just been an aberration and the man who had sold himself to them as the \u201cGreat Entertainer\u201d would live up to his reputation. If anything, he was even more hopeless. Too much more of this and Tories will be sending letters to the 1922 Committee demanding the return of Theresa May. At least she used to make an attempt at engaging with questions, even if she seldom provided any direct answers. Johnson merely alternated between mumbling and shouting, while insisting his Brexit negotiations would be going swimmingly once he actually got round to starting them and just making facts up to suit himself. He even insisted the Andrew Marr interview in which Gove admitted some food prices could go up \u2013 yippee, it\u2019s dog biscuits all round from November onwards \u2013 had never taken place. You\u2019d have thought someone with a long history of lying to his family and friends would be rather better at lying to parliament. Long before the end, you could see the desperation on the Conservative benches. Not even his fellow cabinet members could summon up much enthusiasm. One Tory MP sent me a simple text that read, \u201cHe is appalling\u201d. It was reported this week that Johnson\u2019s election slogan is likely to be \u201cTrust the people\u201d. A hard sell when not even his own MPs trust him. Thursday One of the other great pleasures of going on holiday is the chance to sit down and read a book \u2013 The Great Romantic, Duncan Hamilton\u2019s biography of the Guardian cricket and music writer Neville Cardus, was an utter joy. I also love wandering around bookshops in the US to check out how different their bestseller charts are from ours in the UK. Apart from the usual rash of How to Get On in Business and Make a Fortune books, what struck me from going to Barnes &amp; Noble was the number of titles about heroic dogs that were in its top 20. I counted at least three. There was The Art of Racing in the Rain: Meet the Dog who will Show the World how to be Human, the story of how a pooch brought a family together and turned a bloke into a racing driver. There was also A Dog\u2019s Journeyabout a pit bull mix who gets lost, wanders round a bit and then comes home, and A Dog\u2019s Purpose about a dog that teaches people to be nicer to each other. I wondered if it might catch on over here and if I might be able to cash in with a book about my own dog, Herbert Hound. Though it might have to be quite short. I can\u2019t see much film tie-in potential in the story of how he had such a good time staying with our friends Kim and Sarah while we were away \u2013 they were happy to throw him a ball for hours on end, even though his retrieval success rate is only one in three \u2013 that he sulked for a week when he got back home. Friday It also appears to be sod\u2019s law that I managed to miss one of England\u2019s greatest finishes to a Test match since 1981 and have come home to find the cricket team has reverted to playing as badly as it did before I left. Nor are Spurs doing much for my mental wellbeing. Last Sunday\u2019s north London Derby against Arsenal was more pain. Surrendering a two-goal lead and hanging on like grim death for a draw, only to miss a golden chance to steal the win right at the end, was 90 minutes of pure misery.

I read a report recently that pessimists have a much shorter life expectancy than optimists. In which case, I suspect I am already on borrowed time.

Rhetorical war may be better than real war. But it is an ever more polarised conflict. No-deal Brexit may deliver Johnson some populist gain, but is not the product of a responsive democracy. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

Calling for the 21 rebel Tory MPs who voted against the government on Tuesday night to be reinstated, Major told an audience at the CBI annual dinner:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The government must change its tone. Ministers routinely insult half the electorate as \u201cRemoaners\u201d. The surgeon who drew up the Yellowhammer risk register of epilepsy and neurology drugs is told he is a \u201cfear-mongering Remainer\u201d.</p> \n   <p>Businessmen are warned that a negative attitude on Brexit will lead to their companies being frozen out of any future government consultation. This is behaviour I never thought to see from any British government, and it must stop.</p> \n   <p>The abuse comes from Cabinet ministers; and the threats from No 10 special advisers. I repeat: it must stop.</p> \n   <p>Ahead lie many challenges. If we are to meet them we need government of the highest quality, not government by bluster and threat in a climate of aggressive bullying.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>While the former Tory leader made no explicit reference to Cummings, he said politicians had \u201cseen overmighty advisers before\u201d.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is a familiar script. It always ends badly. I offer the Prime Minister some friendly advice: get rid of these advisers before they poison the political atmosphere beyond repair. And do it quickly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And, referring to Brexit generally, he added:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Anti-Europeans may cheer, but a weaker Europe leaves the UK more at the mercy of decisions taken by a \u2013 I hope temporarily \u2013 dysfunctional United States, and a long-term autocratic China.</p> \n   <p>It also leaves the UK more vulnerable to Putin\u2019s aggressive and assertive Russia. None of that will be welcome, but it is the inevitable legacy of Brexit.</p> \n   <p>Our new UK government knows this to be true. Yet they ignore it \u2013 and pursue our exit from Europe on an artificial date, without a deal. Some do so for ideological reasons. Others for political and personal advantage. Neither the ideologue nor the self-interested Brexiteer appears to put our national wellbeing first.</p> \n   <p>Our new Cabinet has no majority and no mandate ... It is not a Cabinet of all available talents. It is a faction of a faction, with no counter-balance of opinion to hold it back. Upon Brexit, the Cabinet non\u2013believers are mere window dressing. They will not be listened to, and will always be out-voted.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7150398f083106f455627d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T18:15:36.240Z\">7.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Earlier, we reported that <strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg</strong> had been heavily criticised for using parliamentary privilege to attack the reputation of a doctor who has warned about the dangers of a no-deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> (see: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/05/brexit-lords--blow--boris-johnson-pass-bill-stopping-no-deal-politics-live?page=with:block-5d711d388f083106f4555f7c#block-5d711d388f083106f4555f7c\">4.35pm</a>).</p> \n  <p>Now, No 10 are distancing themselves from his comments:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jessicaelgot/status/1169671972978118657\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Breaking - No 10 spox on Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s comments comparing Dr David Nicholl to disgraced anti-vaxxer Andrew Wakefield.<br><br>\u201cThe Prime Minister does not share this view.\u201d</p>\u2014 Jessica Elgot (@jessicaelgot) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jessicaelgot/status/1169671972978118657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 5, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>And the chief medical officer for England, <strong>Prof Sally Davies</strong>, has written to Rees-Mogg, calling his actions \u201cunacceptable\u201d:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CMO_England/status/1169673321522388995\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I have written to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jacob_Rees_Mogg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Jacob_Rees_Mogg</a> to express my sincere disappointment and show my support for doctors across the country, particularly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/djnicholl?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@djnicholl</a>. <br><br>Doctors are amongst the most trusted people in our country; it is worth listening to what they have to say with respect. <a href=\"https://t.co/WPGLcWIgSz\">pic.twitter.com/WPGLcWIgSz</a></p>\u2014 Prof Sally Davies (@CMO_England) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CMO_England/status/1169673321522388995?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 5, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T18:24:33.676Z\">at 7.24pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d714a8b8f08143ee1ae0ddf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T18:10:36.769Z\">7.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Judges are expected to announce their decision on Friday on the latest legal challenge to <strong>Boris Johnson </strong>over his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks.</p> \n  <p><strong>Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett</strong> and two other judges at the high court in London have been urged to find that Johnson\u2019s 28 August advice to the Queen to prorogue Parliament for an \u201cexceptional\u201d length of time was an \u201cunlawful abuse of power\u201d.</p> \n  <p>After hearing submissions on Thursday on an urgent judicial review application brought by <strong>Gina Miller</strong>, Lord Burnett announced that the hearing would be adjourned until 10am on Friday.</p> \n  <p>In a witness statement released after the hearing, <strong>Sir John Major</strong> said it was \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d for the government to \u201cseek to bypass\u201d Parliament because it does not agree with the proposed course of action on a certain policy.<br></p> \n  <p>The former prime minister, who joined the Conservative party on his 16th birthday, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I served in Parliament for over 20 years both as a backbench MP and as a government minister at cabinet and more junior levels.

Even by Johnson\u2019s standards, it was rambling and shambolic. The only rational explanation I can think for what happened is that it is all part of some ultra-cunning plan to convince Jeremy Corbyn that he can vote for an election because Johnson will be such a hopeless campaigner, but life normally doesn\u2019t work like that. If it looks like a cock-up, it probably is a cock-up.</p> \n  <p>First, the backdrop was pure Donald Trump. Although ostensibly an event to promote the government\u2019s police recruitment plans, this was obviously a party political event - No 10 described it this morning as day one of the election campaign - and so there was something clearly improper about getting the police to act as extras on set. And if you do want to present yourself as a politician committed to supporting the police, it is best not to force them to stand in the sun for so long (Johnson started about an hour late) that they start dropping like flies. </p> \n  <p>If you do invite people to listen to a speech and then force them to wait, you should at least prepare something of merit to say. But Johnson wasn\u2019t speaking from a script, and he appeared to have given very little thought to what he wanted to say about policing (beyond a threadbare argument about policing being at the heart of a successful economy). At one point he launched into a very bizarre routine about the police caution; quite what that was all about remains a mystery. Of course, sounding improvised is part of the Johnson schtick - in his Churchill biography he quotes approvingly the FE Smith line that Churchill \u201cspent the best years of his life preparing his impromptu remarks\u201d; Johnson has mastered the same trick himself - but today this did not sound like artful spontaneity. To be honest, it sounded like he had had a glass too many at lunchtime.</p> \n  <p>On Monday Johnson stood outside Number 10 and said he did not want an election. Today\u2019s message was all about taunting/shaming Corbyn into agreeing one. Even someone as practiced at inconsistency as Johnson would find this hard to pull off, and in the office where I was watching his insincerity seemed obvious - although perhaps outside the \u201cbubble\u201d people may be willing to credit his claim that he doesn\u2019t really want an election at all.</p> \n  <p>To his credit, Johnson did take a large number of questions. His most interesting line was his assertion that he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than request an article 50 extension in October, as he might be obliged to by a bill becoming law on Monday. That did not sound literally true either, but at least that was a hyperbole untruth, not a statement of bad faith. Perhaps leave voters, and the wider group of voters who just want the Brexit crisis saga to end, will cheer this message. But whether that compensates for the overall impression of omnishambles is another matter.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7139ea8f082514879ee994\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T16:41:21.411Z\">5.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: Corbyn says he cannot trust you to have an election before the EU summit in October?</em></p> \n  <p>Johnson claims this is a new charge.</p> \n  <p>He says he wants an election on 15 October. \u201cEarlier if he wants ... let\u2019s crack on with it.\u201d He says he does not see how the UK\u2019s negotiating position can be torpedoed.</p> \n  <p>One of the police officers standing behind Johnson has just stood down.

What we\u2019re not prepared to do is sign up to a general election until we are as certain as we possibly can be that this prime minister would not subvert any agreement and still try to find a way to take the UK out of the EU without a deal.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He dismissed the idea that during the next general election Welsh Labour should forge pacts with other parties to counter a possible Tory/Brexit Party alliance. </strong>He said:<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m instinctively not attracted to them [pacts].

But he said the position was \u201cinherently volatile\u201d. He said the \u201csmallest changes\u201d could lead to traffic jams stretching off the island on to the north Wales mainland.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He stressed that Welsh Labour was a party of remain, even though Wales overall voted leave.</strong> He said: <br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will will continue to argue that Wales\u2019 best interests are best protected by continued membership of the EU.

All three were circulated inside Number 10, including to Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s chief strategist, and Ed Lister, his chief of staff, but no cabinet minister other than Johnson.</p> \n  <p>The first on 15 August from Da Costa setting out their prorogation strategy was ticked by Johnson, with his scribbled note \u201cyes\u201d. He replied the next day with a handwritten note which said: \u201cwhole September session [at Westminster] is a rigmarole introduced to show the public that MPs are earning their crust. I don\u2019t see anything especially shocking about this prorogation.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The UK government said they were blacked out because the censored parts were not relevant or protected by \u201clegal professional privilege\u201d. Andrew Webster QC, for the UK government, told the court it was essential to keep them confidential to preserve cabinet confidentiality.</p> \n  <p>In what O\u2019Neill described as a snub to the Scottish courts, they were not given to the court of session as primary pieces of evidence backed up as affidavits, but were released only because they were being submitted as evidence to the parallel Gina Miller case in London, which started today.</p> \n  <p>Kenny McBrearty QC, appearing for the BBC and News UK, said it was in the public interest and in the interests of open justice for those memos to be published in full. If Number 10 had decided it was appropriate it was to give them to the court, where they were read out in part by O\u2019Neill on Tuesday, then clearly they were not totally confidential. </p> \n  <p>O\u2019Neill has made a separate submission to the three judges, arguing the documents could only be redacted by the court. Downing Street could not unilaterally decide which sections to release, without proper scrutiny. Downing Street had also chosen not to apply for a public interest immunity (PII) certificate \u2013 an orthodox route to keep key documents secret.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T12:19:25.433Z\">at 1.19pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d70f9ca8f0891025b4485bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T12:06:42.909Z\">1.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Asked about Jo Johnson\u2019s resignation at business questions, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, said MPs were used to the idea that people within families might disagree on policy.

I respect their position. But I know from meetings I have had with local members that many are as dismayed as me by the course of negotiations and about the actual choice now on offer. Two-and-a-half years on, the practical Brexit options are now clear and the public should be asked to choose between the different paths facing our country: we will all have different positions on that choice, but I think many in my local party, in the Orpington constituency and around the country would welcome having the last word on the government\u2019s Brexit proposals.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T11:03:49.288Z\">at 12.03pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d70e84e8f08b2e15bc1ab9f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T10:50:44.826Z\">11.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is from <strong>Robin Niblett</strong>, director of the Chatham House thinktank</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RobinNiblett/status/1169561719255031811\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Having heard Jo Johnson speak eloquently and passionately in the recent past about the need for the UK to have a close and effective long-term relationship with the EU, this seems like a logical decision.

The easiest way for the PM to hold an early election would be for two-thirds of MPs to vote for one (the threshold set out in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act), but this would require opposition support. An alternative approach would be to legislate to amend the FTPA, but even though this would require just a simple majority, Boris Johnson does not have one at the moment, meaning this route would also require opposition cooperation.</p> \n  <p>At the start of this week Labour faced at least four possible options.</p> \n  <p>1) Agree an election immediately.</p> \n  <p>2) Agree an election once the Benn bill designed to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October becomes law, which is now due to happen next Monday.</p> \n  <p>3) Agree an election once the Benn bill has become law, and Johnson has provided some cast-iron assurance as to when the date will be.</p> \n  <p>4) Agree an election only after the EU has agreed to extend article 50 beyond the end of October. Assuming the PM did not agree a Brexit deal beforehand (which currently seems unlikely), this means that Labour would not vote for an early election until after 19 October, the deadline in the Benn bill for an article 50 request. The election would then take place in November at the earliest.</p> \n  <p>Labour ruled out 1). But, in the debate last night, <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> implied that 2) was his position. He told Johnson: \u201cLet [the Benn bill] pass and gain royal assent, and then we will back an election.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But many in the Labour party want the party to wait much longer. And in his interview McDonnell confirmed that the party was considering a delay. He said the party was worried about Johnson trying to change the date.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The problem that we had is that we couldn\u2019t determine the date of the election. Of course, Boris Johnson might come along say\u201d \u2018I promise you it will be such and such a date.\u2019 But he\u2019s not renowned ... for delivering on what he says ... We can\u2019t trust him. It\u2019s not just me; it\u2019s his own side.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>McDonnell said Labour was consulting on how a bill to amend the FTPA could be used to fix the date of a general election. A bill could set 15 October as the date for the election. But McDonnell also said there was a case for holding it later, after the EU summit in October. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The problem that we\u2019ve got is that we cannot at the moment have any confidence in Boris Johnson abiding by any commitment or deal that we could construct. That\u2019s the truth of it. So we\u2019re now consulting about whether it\u2019s better to go long, therefore, rather than to go short. And that decision will be taken.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Although McDonnell did not acknowledge it, another advantage for Labour in delaying the election until November is that, if Brexit had to be delayed, the Conservatives would get hammered by the Brexit party.</p> \n  <p>Despite what Corbyn said in the debate last night, the BBC\u2019s <strong>Laura Kuenssberg</strong> says Corbyn is saying in private that he is going to wait.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1169365639103991809\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A senior Labour MP has just said Jeremy Corbyn told him tonight he would NOT allow Boris Johnson to have an election before 31st October</p>\u2014 Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1169365639103991809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 4, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01731fc0c07614db38a94a97ca419db47ae9f835\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01731fc0c07614db38a94a97ca419db47ae9f835/0_107_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John McDonnell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John McDonnell.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T09:22:57.479Z\">at 10.22am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d70c5378f08b2e15bc1aa05\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T08:21:16.884Z\">9.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95d69135022fba1c7153be81cacb7374b2385b85\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95d69135022fba1c7153be81cacb7374b2385b85/0_64_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shami Chakrabarti (centre), the shadow attorney general, arriving at the Royal Courts of Justice this morning for the high court legal challenge to the PM\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shami Chakrabarti (centre), the shadow attorney general, arriving at the Royal Courts of Justice this morning for the high court legal challenge to the PM\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d70c0928f081f0141f4e077\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T08:14:16.917Z\">9.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">No 10 sets outs Boris Johnson's election message to voters</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>General elections are all about choices and what Boris Johnson has been been doing this week has been trying to frame the forthcoming election as a choice between someone who will deliver Brexit by 31 October and someone who won\u2019t.

Here is another extract from the statement Number 10 released to journalists this morning.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Since becoming prime minister, Boris has promised more investment for our NHS, more police on our streets to tackle violent crime and more funding for our schools to ensure every child has an excellent education, regardless of where they live. He has already delivered on his promises to level up the country and he wants to continue this agenda.</p> \n   <p>But to do this we must deliver Brexit.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>There is an irony in this. As one of the leaders of the Vote Leave campaign, you would have thought that Johnson might be proud of Brexit. But now it is as if he is very keen to change the subject.</p> \n  <p>The argument is also flawed, in at least two respects. First, the government does not need to leave the EU to spend more money on public services etc. In fact, all mainstream economic analysis says Brexit will leave less money for these services. And second, even after the UK has left the EU, the argument about Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU will continue for years. Brexit is not going to vanish as a story anytime soon.</p> \n  <p>So why is No 10 pushing this argument? Because voters like to hear it, according to Politico\u2019s <strong>Jack Blanchard.</strong> Here is an extract from <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/london-playbook/politico-london-playbook-presented-by-exxonmobil-the-mayhem-continues-blue-murder-watch-like-a-pro-part-ii/\">his London Playbook briefing yesterday.</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[A senior government minister] also predicted the opposition parties are playing straight into [Dominic] Cummings\u2019 hands \u2014 and that the Tories are now on course to win a snap election. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the numbers from CCHQ, it really is black and white,\u201d they said. \u201cPeople want it done.

Or they can choose Boris Johnson, who will not only deliver on that central promise to leave the EU, but also on the people\u2019s priorities.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T07:37:00.577Z\">at 8.37am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d70af1a8f08b2e15bc1a996\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T06:48:43.395Z\">7.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">No 10 accuses Corbyn of 'cowardly insult to democracy' for not backing early election</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Boris Johnson </strong>appears to be preparing for another lectern moment.</p> \n  <p>A Number 10 spokesman said the prime minister would today \u201cspeak directly to the public, setting out the vital choice that faces our country\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The spokesman added: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>He will argue that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s \u2018surrender bill\u2019 will force the prime minister to go to Brussels and surrender to any demands they make.

It is clear the only action is to go back to the people and give them the opportunity to decide what they want: Boris to go to Brussels and get a deal, or leave without one on 31 October or Jeremy Corbyn arriving in Brussels with his surrender bill begging for more delay, more dither and accepting whatever terms Brussels imposes over our nation.</p> \n   <p>For Jeremy Corbyn to continue to avoid an election would be a cowardly insult to democracy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T07:42:37.202Z\">at 8.42am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d70aeb58f08b2e15bc1a995\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T06:45:19.190Z\">7.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/269157?fbclid=IwAR2EgtT0oDQhT_7ZF62i9d9_M8wEhrRKcikDGXjZMgYOQSVLVwm2uOF2Sds\">petition against proroguing parliament</a>, which was signed by more than 1.7m people, will be debated on Monday.</p> \n  <p>It only needed 100,000 signatures to secure a debate.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d70ac058f0891025b4482f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/matthewweaver\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T06:40:11.779Z\">7.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The shadow chancellor, <strong>John McDonnell,</strong> has played down Keir Starmer\u2019s suggestion that Labour would only back an early election after the bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit has been implemented.</p> \n  <p>Speaking to Sky News, McDonnell said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Keir said that is one of the options, that\u2019s why we are consulting.

<p>Welcome especially to any members of the House of Lords who might happen to follow this live blog and who had a late night on Wednesday.</p> \n  <p>Our honourable friends in the upper house were up debating the Benn bill until the wee hours when the deadlock finally broke and Lords voted in favour of getting the bill, which rules out a no-deal Brexit and was passed by the House of Commons earlier this week, through all stages of parliament by Friday afternoon, before parliament is suspended by Boris Johnson.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/brexit-lords-agree-to-push-through-bill-preventing-no-deal-by-end-of-friday\">That agreement was reached around 1:30am</a> on Thursday when peers passed a business motion that means the Benn bill will be returned to the lower house by 5pm on Friday, ruling out the prospect of attempts at a filibuster.</p> \n  <p>From there, the bill can be voted on again by MPs on Monday and presented for royal assent. Jeremy Corbyn has said he would support calls for a snap general election if the Benn bill preventing a no-deal Brexit received royal assent, so this is a significant step.</p> \n  <p>Peers are set to debate the Benn bill itself and amendments today. We\u2019ll be bringing you news of that debate, and everything else that is going on, as it happens. As I have been throughout the week, I\u2019ll be kicking things off before handing over to my colleagues.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to wrap up the blog for now. Our main story is here. Thanks for reading. Boris Johnson was dealt a huge blow after his brother Jo Johnson announced he was quitting the cabinet, citing an \u201cunresolvable tension\u201d between his family loyalty and the national interest. The announcement seemed to rattle the Boris Johnson seriously as he gave a speech at a police training academy in West Yorkshire. His answer to questions on his brother\u2019s resignation were meandering and after thanking his sibling for his work as the universities minister and calling him a \u201cfantastic guy\u201d, he admitted Brexit \u201cdivides families\u201d. Johnson pledged he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than bow to the demands of the no-deal bill passed by the House of Commons and request a Brexit extension. MPs will be asked on Monday to vote for early election said Jacob Rees-Mogg. However, Jeremy Corbyn looks poised to reject Boris Johnson\u2019s demand for a 15 October election for a second time on Monday. Despite being taunted by Johnson as a \u201cchlorinated chicken\u201d who is afraid of facing the public, Corbyn is holding out for an election on Labour\u2019s own terms \u2013 most likely at a later date. Jacob Rees-Mogg has apologised after comparing a consultant who helped draw up no-deal medical plans to the disgraced anti-vaxxer Andrew Wakefield. Rees-Mogg had told MPs that, in warning about the possible effects of a no-deal Brexit on medical supplies, Nicholl was being as irresponsible as Wakefield, who was struck off the medical register in 2010 after suggesting a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Rees-Mogg apologised after intense pressure from the medical profession, as well as Westminster colleagues. Michael Gove is to meet Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, at the weekend for talks on Brexit as tensions mount over Brexit and the Irish border. The meeting, in Cambridge, will take place just before Boris Johnson\u2019s visit to Dublin on Monday when he will meet the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, for the first time since becoming prime minister. The pound has slipped back a little in early overnight trading. It is buying $1.2322 at the moment after hitting a five-week high of $1.2353 after the chances of a no-deal Brexit receded slightly this week. Against the euro it is \u20ac1.1166. But Neil Wilson, chief analyst at Markets.com in London, cautioned that the Brexit \u201cpantomime\u201d still had some way to run. \u201cThe political situation remains very fluid and uncertain, making this trade very hard to call,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only certainty is that the pound is exposed to a significant amount of headline risk and volatility as markets react to the news flow. That said, the trend right now is positive.\u201d Then of course there was the Evening Standard, which underwent some revisions between editions. Good evening, this is Kate Lyons taking the blog back from Kevin Rawlinson. I will bring you any late-night developments before we shut the blog down for the day. And let\u2019s kick things off with a selection of some of the papers. Shortly after Rees-Mogg apologised, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, intervened to \u201cstick up for doctors\u201d: A little background on this issue: Rees-Mogg clashed with Nicholl over no-deal Brexit contingency plans the latter helped to draw up. The consultant neurologist spoke out as a whistleblower over the government\u2019s apparent inability to stockpile certain drugs. His comments on a radio phone-in prompted criticism from the ardent Brexiter. Later \u2013 and while sheltered by Parliamentary privilege \u2013 Rees-Mogg told MPs that Nicholl\u2019s actions rendered him as irresponsible as Wakefield, who was struck off the medical register in 2010 after suggesting a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. During a Commons business statement, Rees-Mogg said: Preparations are in place and they are being done with remarkable efficiency. But yes, a lot of Remainers wish to make our skins crawl. What he had to say, I will repeat it, is as irresponsible as Dr Wakefield in threatening that people will die because we leave the European Union. What level of irresponsibility was that? And I\u2019m afraid it seems to me that Dr David Nicholl is as irresponsible as Dr Wakefield. The leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has apologised to Dr David Nicholl for comparing him to Andrew Wakefield, the disgraced anti-vaxxer who was widely blamed for the MMR jab scare. According to the Press Association, Rees-Mogg has said: I apologise to Dr Nicholl for the comparison with Dr Wakefield. I have the utmost respect for all of the country\u2019s hardworking medical professionals and the work they do in caring for the people of this country. The government is working closely with the NHS, industry and distributors to help ensure the supply of medicine and medical products remains uninterrupted once we leave the EU on 31 October, whatever the circumstances. Rees-Mogg had earlier come in for serious criticism from high profile sources, including the chief medical officer for England and the British Medical Association. (See: 7.15pm and 4.35pm) The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has warned that there is \u201cno such thing as a clean break\u201d \u2013 Brexit deal or no Brexit deal \u2013 with difficult and complex negotiations on the future relationship with the EU whatever the outcome of talks. In a speech in Dublin to the British and Irish Chambers of Commerce, he has said: If there is no deal \u2013 and I believe we may have to live with no deal for a period \u2013 then, at a certain point, we will have to begin negotiations again. The first and only items on the agenda ... will be citizens\u2019 rights, the financial settlement with the EU and a solution to the Irish border. Varadkar acknowledged for the first time that some checks on goods and live animals entering the Republic or Ireland would take place \u201cnear the border\u201d. And he stressed that the Irish government was \u201copen to alternatives\u201d to the backstop \u2013 but that they had to be realistic and legally binding. \u201cWe have received no such proposals to date,\u201d he said. In what appeared to be a pre-emptive strike against expected proposals from Boris Johnson that Ireland align itself to the UK to avoid disruption, he said: Whatever happens, Ireland will not be dragged out of the single European market. And Varadkar added and update on discussions with the UK prime minister: Recently, Prime Minister Johnson and I spoke by phone. We spoke of our shared desire to see the Northern Ireland political institutions reinstated. We shared our perspectives on the withdrawal agreement and agreed that our teams would establish one-to-one contact. We will meet again in Dublin on Monday. Unfortunately, given political developments in the UK, there is a significant and growing risk of no-deal. We don\u2019t wish to see a no-deal Brexit and we will continue our efforts to avoid one, but not at any cost. Unlike some, I see no upsides to no-deal. I do fear it. But I am prepared for it. Here\u2019s some more detail on the criticism of Johnson from the West Yorkshire police and crime commissioner, Labour\u2019s Mark Burns-Williamson: To use police officers as the backdrop to what became a political speech was inappropriate and they shouldn\u2019t have been put in that position. It clearly turned into a rant about Brexit, the opposition and a potential general election. There\u2019s no way that police officers should\u2019ve formed the backdrop to a speech of that nature. Asked if Johnson should apologise, he said: Yes, because he\u2019s used the pretence of an announcement around police recruitment for mainly a political speech. Burns-Williamson said he had expressed his concerns to the chief constable of West Yorkshire police and asked for an explanation around what happened. Among the stranger moments of Johnson\u2019s speech this afternoon was a halting attempt to recite the police caution: For the record, it\u2019s: You do not have to say anything. But, it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence. Plaid Cymru will not back the prime minister\u2019s motion for an early election when the question is asked again on Monday, the party\u2019s Westminster Leader Liz Saville Roberts has confirmed. We face one of the weakest governments in history. Without a majority and hamstrung by a mess of their own making. Boris Johnson is on the ropes and we must not give him the reprieve of a general election on his terms. Voting for the government motion will undermine the progress we have made blocking a no-deal Brexit. If other opposition parties\u2019 priority is stopping this Brexit mess, now is a better time than any to take control and deliver a fresh referendum. We won\u2019t dance to his tune. In this Parliament we can beat both Boris and Brexit. More from Sir John Major, who has urged Boris Johnson to ditch his \u201covermighty advisers\u201d before politics is poisoned; thought to be a reference to Dominic Cummings. Calling for the 21 rebel Tory MPs who voted against the government on Tuesday night to be reinstated, Major told an audience at the CBI annual dinner: The government must change its tone. Ministers routinely insult half the electorate as \u201cRemoaners\u201d. The surgeon who drew up the Yellowhammer risk register of epilepsy and neurology drugs is told he is a \u201cfear-mongering Remainer\u201d. Businessmen are warned that a negative attitude on Brexit will lead to their companies being frozen out of any future government consultation. This is behaviour I never thought to see from any British government, and it must stop. The abuse comes from Cabinet ministers; and the threats from No 10 special advisers. I repeat: it must stop. Ahead lie many challenges. If we are to meet them we need government of the highest quality, not government by bluster and threat in a climate of aggressive bullying. While the former Tory leader made no explicit reference to Cummings, he said politicians had \u201cseen overmighty advisers before\u201d. It is a familiar script. It always ends badly. I offer the Prime Minister some friendly advice: get rid of these advisers before they poison the political atmosphere beyond repair. And do it quickly. And, referring to Brexit generally, he added: Anti-Europeans may cheer, but a weaker Europe leaves the UK more at the mercy of decisions taken by a \u2013 I hope temporarily \u2013 dysfunctional United States, and a long-term autocratic China. It also leaves the UK more vulnerable to Putin\u2019s aggressive and assertive Russia. None of that will be welcome, but it is the inevitable legacy of Brexit. Our new UK government knows this to be true. Yet they ignore it \u2013 and pursue our exit from Europe on an artificial date, without a deal. Some do so for ideological reasons. Others for political and personal advantage. Neither the ideologue nor the self-interested Brexiteer appears to put our national wellbeing first. Our new Cabinet has no majority and no mandate ... It is not a Cabinet of all available talents. It is a faction of a faction, with no counter-balance of opinion to hold it back. Upon Brexit, the Cabinet non\u2013believers are mere window dressing. They will not be listened to, and will always be out-voted. Earlier, we reported that Jacob Rees-Mogg had been heavily criticised for using parliamentary privilege to attack the reputation of a doctor who has warned about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit (see: 4.35pm). Now, No 10 are distancing themselves from his comments: And the chief medical officer for England, Prof Sally Davies, has written to Rees-Mogg, calling his actions \u201cunacceptable\u201d: Judges are expected to announce their decision on Friday on the latest legal challenge to Boris Johnson over his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks. Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and two other judges at the high court in London have been urged to find that Johnson\u2019s 28 August advice to the Queen to prorogue Parliament for an \u201cexceptional\u201d length of time was an \u201cunlawful abuse of power\u201d. After hearing submissions on Thursday on an urgent judicial review application brought by Gina Miller, Lord Burnett announced that the hearing would be adjourned until 10am on Friday. In a witness statement released after the hearing, Sir John Major said it was \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d for the government to \u201cseek to bypass\u201d Parliament because it does not agree with the proposed course of action on a certain policy. The former prime minister, who joined the Conservative party on his 16th birthday, said: I served in Parliament for over 20 years both as a backbench MP and as a government minister at cabinet and more junior levels. I was, of course, prime minister for nearly seven years and am very proud to have been in the Commons and a minister. I have huge admiration for our Parliament and am a keen supporter of its rights and duties. I cannot stand idly by and watch them set aside in this fashion. I appreciate that this is not the government\u2019s stated intention for proroguing Parliament, but for the reasons set out in this statement, the inescapable inference to be drawn is that the prorogation is to prevent Parliament from exercising its right to disagree with the government and to legislate as it sees fit. He said the government had not adequately explained why it needed to suspend Parliament for as long as five weeks. Essentially, the protection of individual rights afforded by Parliament is being compromised. In order to allegedly protect the democratic outcome of the referendum, the government believes it is justified in suspending the UK\u2019s democratic processes to achieve its desired ends. This is unacceptable and is the reason I was determined to assist in these proceedings. Here\u2019s more from Yvette Cooper, who has said she will be taking the matter further: For Boris Johnson to make so many police stop their training and work to be part of his political stunt is an abuse of power. Police officers and trainees are overstretched and need to be able to get on with their job, not have to waste time listening to Boris Johnson\u2019s political press conference. For Boris Johnson to draw so many of them into a long, election-driven event like this is completely inappropriate and it is unfair on the people of West Yorkshire who are entitled to expect that their police are allowed to get on with the job of working and training to keep them safe. I am writing to the Cabinet Secretary as well as the West Yorkshire Chief Constable, John Robins, to ask how this has happened and what guidelines were followed. Johnson\u2019s use of police officers as a backdrop to his speech has been criticised by opponents, including the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott: Yvette Cooper, the chair of the Commons Home Affairs committee, has said: And then there\u2019s this from the Labour MP, David Lammy: And the BBC\u2019s Danny Shaw reports that the local police and crime commissioner, Labour\u2019s Mark Burns-Williamson, is less than happy: The Northern Ireland minister, Nick Hurd, has become the latest Tory MP to announce he will not stand at the next general election as he cited the \u201congoing division\u201d over Brexit. The Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner MP said: Fourteen years ago, my intention was to serve in Parliament for as long as my constituents continued to elect me. However, much has changed since then. Politics is now dominated by the ongoing division over Brexit. More happily, my private life has been changed profoundly by the birth of my two youngest children. I now feel that it is time for me to make a change and embrace a new challenge. After a very great deal of thought, I have decided not to stand again as a candidate at the next general election. And this is what some other journalists and commentators are saying about the Johnson speech. From the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves From LBC\u2019s Theo Usherwood From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar From my colleague Patrick Wintour From Politico Europe\u2019s Jack Blanchard From the Daily Mail\u2019s Peter Oborne That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. That was the most extraordinary prime ministerial press conference we\u2019ve seen for years - perhaps not quite as dramatic as Theresa May\u2019s \u201cnothing has changed\u201d meltdown, but certainly more peculiar. Even by Johnson\u2019s standards, it was rambling and shambolic. The only rational explanation I can think for what happened is that it is all part of some ultra-cunning plan to convince Jeremy Corbyn that he can vote for an election because Johnson will be such a hopeless campaigner, but life normally doesn\u2019t work like that. If it looks like a cock-up, it probably is a cock-up. First, the backdrop was pure Donald Trump. Although ostensibly an event to promote the government\u2019s police recruitment plans, this was obviously a party political event - No 10 described it this morning as day one of the election campaign - and so there was something clearly improper about getting the police to act as extras on set. And if you do want to present yourself as a politician committed to supporting the police, it is best not to force them to stand in the sun for so long (Johnson started about an hour late) that they start dropping like flies. If you do invite people to listen to a speech and then force them to wait, you should at least prepare something of merit to say. But Johnson wasn\u2019t speaking from a script, and he appeared to have given very little thought to what he wanted to say about policing (beyond a threadbare argument about policing being at the heart of a successful economy). At one point he launched into a very bizarre routine about the police caution; quite what that was all about remains a mystery. Of course, sounding improvised is part of the Johnson schtick - in his Churchill biography he quotes approvingly the FE Smith line that Churchill \u201cspent the best years of his life preparing his impromptu remarks\u201d; Johnson has mastered the same trick himself - but today this did not sound like artful spontaneity. To be honest, it sounded like he had had a glass too many at lunchtime. On Monday Johnson stood outside Number 10 and said he did not want an election. Today\u2019s message was all about taunting/shaming Corbyn into agreeing one. Even someone as practiced at inconsistency as Johnson would find this hard to pull off, and in the office where I was watching his insincerity seemed obvious - although perhaps outside the \u201cbubble\u201d people may be willing to credit his claim that he doesn\u2019t really want an election at all. To his credit, Johnson did take a large number of questions. His most interesting line was his assertion that he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than request an article 50 extension in October, as he might be obliged to by a bill becoming law on Monday. That did not sound literally true either, but at least that was a hyperbole untruth, not a statement of bad faith. Perhaps leave voters, and the wider group of voters who just want the Brexit crisis saga to end, will cheer this message. But whether that compensates for the overall impression of omnishambles is another matter. Q: Corbyn says he cannot trust you to have an election before the EU summit in October? Johnson claims this is a new charge. He says he wants an election on 15 October. \u201cEarlier if he wants ... let\u2019s crack on with it.\u201d He says he does not see how the UK\u2019s negotiating position can be torpedoed. One of the police officers standing behind Johnson has just stood down. She seems to be feeling faint or ill. Johnson expresses some concern, and then winds up his remarks. As Johnson is winding up, the officer stands up again. And that\u2019s it. I will post a verdict and summary shortly. Q: Are you planning an all-Ireland regime for agri-foods? Johnson says there is the germ of a solution to the backstop problem in the late Ian Paisley comment about the Northern Irish being British, but their cattle being Irish. But he says what is crucial is the idea of democratic control by the people of the UK. Q: When are you going to have an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party, as you promised in the BBC TV debate? Johnson says he will have an inquiry into all kinds of racism in the party. He does not say when it will start. Q: Do you regret the purge of MPs? Johnson says the bill passed yesterday will make it harder for him to get a Brexit deal. Under this plan, Brussels would decide how long the UK stayed in the EU. He says he cannot see how that is democratic. (Actually, the bill does not say that. The UK would get the final say. More details here.) Discipline is sometimes tough, he says. Q: Can you promise not to go back to Brussels and ask for an extension? Yes, says Johnson. I would rather be dead in a ditch. He says an extension would cost \u00a31bn a month and be \u201ctotally pointless\u201d. Q: You said you would unite the country when you became leader. But you are now splitting your own party, and your own brother won\u2019t even support you. Johnson says people disagree about Brexit. But the way to unite this country is to get this done, he says. Q: Shouldn\u2019t you be next to resign? Johnson says MPs said they would respect the referendum. He says there is a stark contrast between his approach and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s. He says they are making it impossible for the country to leave the EU, and for the country to have an election. He says Corbyn must be the first opposition lead to oppose an election. That goes against his job description, he says. Q: Aren\u2019t people entitled to ask, if your own brother can\u2019t back you, why should anyone else? Johnson says his brother Jo is fantastic guy and was a fantastic minister for science. (His most recent job was universitiies minister.) He says Jo wants the government to sort Brexit out. And he says Jo has said this afternoon that he supports his domestic policies. (See 3.10pm.) Johnson is now talking about Brexit. He says he will take the UK out by 31 October. Or someone else would have to take over. But that is not the best course, he says. He says an election should decide. He says he \u201chates banging on about Brexit\u201d. I don\u2019t want an election at all ... But frankly I don\u2019t see any other way. He says people must choose between sending him or Jeremy Corbyn to the Brussels summit in October. He apologises for bringing \u201cthis painful subject\u201d up. People do not want to see politicians going on about Brexit, he says. He says they want to see politicians focusing on people\u2019s concerns, like policing. But we must, must, must settle this EU debate. Policing is \u201cthe top priority of this government\u201d, he says. My colleague Jessica Elgot is not impressed. Johnson asks police what the police caution is. None of them read it out to him, so he tries to recite it himself. You do not have to say anything, but anything you do say may be taken down as evidence and used in evidence against you. (Except Johnson does not say it coherently. He stumbles, and gives up half way through. Is he expecting someone to help him out? It is not clear, but it looks as though he has given no thought at all to what he wants to say.) Boris Johnson is speaking now. He says today is the launch of his programme to recruit a large number of extra police officers. He wants to deliver on the priorities of the British people. He says he hopes people saw the spending announcement yesterday. In his view, policing is the bedrock of society. It is what gives people the confidence to grow the economy. He says he used to be mayor of London, crime commissioner for London. The most important thing politicians can do is back the police. It is up to politicians to provide \u201ctop cover\u201d for the police, he says. More from my colleague Kate Proctor at the Boris Johnson speech And this is from the New Statesman\u2019s Patrick Maguire. At the Daily Telegraph Johnson was notorious for always filing his column very, very, very late. NHS trusts in Kent have block-booked hotel rooms for staff who may not be able to get into work because the country\u2019s roads are gridlocked if there is a no-deal Brexit. Health service bosses have also discussed with the police using them to get patients through unusually heavy traffic to hospitals in Ashford and Canterbury, which are near the ports of Dover and Folkestone, the Health Service Journal reports today. East Kent University Hospitals NHS trust, which runs the two hospitals, confirmed to HSJ that it has \u201cbooked a small number of hotel rooms close to our emergency hospitals as a precautionary measure, for an initial two-week period [after 31 October]\u201d. The William Harvey hospital near Ashford, which is the area\u2019s main trauma centre - where the most seriously injured patients are treated - \u201cis particularly vulnerable because it is located just off the M20, which is already facing significant delays and disruption due to long-term upgrade work\u201d, HSJ adds. And here is a clip from Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru leader, speaking in the Welsh assembly debate. From the Welsh assembly\u2019s twitter feed From my colleague Kate Proctor, who is in Yorkshire for the Boris Johnson speech Peers have been debating the Benn bill this afternoon, the one intended to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. The bill is expected to clear the Lords by 5pm tomorrow, but Michael Howard, the former Conservative leader, used his speech to attack it strongly. He said: This bill represents an attempt by the legislature to assume the mantle of government. That is why it is wrong. That is why it is illegitimate ... It gets us nowhere. We\u2019ve had one extension. It\u2019s given six months of extra time which resulted in no conclusion. It\u2019s bad enough that parliament thinks it knows better than the British people on this issue. It\u2019s even worse that parliament, as things stand at the moment, is denying the British people a general election, in which they would have the right to decide ... This bill is one of the final acts of a House of Commons which has proved itself manifestly incapable of meeting the challenges in front of it. Boris Johnson\u2019s speech is about to start. He is speaking at a police training centre in Yorkshire. There is a live feed at the top of this page. And here are images of the key documents. Confidential No 10 documents about the government\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament have now been published, as my colleague Severin Carrell anticipated earlier. (See 1.11pm.) The lawyer Jolyon Maugham has tweeted the links. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has been strongly criticised for using parliamentary privilege to attack the reputation of a doctor who has warned about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit. On Monday Rees-Mogg was involved in a row on his LBC phone-in with David Nicholl, a consultant neurologist drew up a risk register of epilepsy and neurology drugs for the government\u2019s Operation Yellowhammer plans for no deal. Rees-Mogg said he did not accept Nicholl\u2019s claim that people could die because of drug shortages in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Nicholl subsequently described the MP as an ignorant \u201cmuppet\u201d. Today Rees-Mogg resumed the dispute at business questions, comparing Nicholl to Andrew Wakefield, the doctor whose discredited research linking autism to the MMR vaccine has been blamed for vaccination levels falling, putting lives at risk. Rees-Mogg told MPs: Preparations are in place and they are being done with remarkable efficiency. But yes, a lot of remainers wish to make our skins crawl. What [Nicholl] had to say, I will repeat it, is as irresponsible as Dr Wakefield in threatening that people will die because we leave the European Union. What level of irresponsibility was that? And I\u2019m afraid it seems to me that Dr David Nicholl is as irresponsible as Dr Wakefield. In response, the SNP MP Carol Monaghan said Rees-Mogg\u2019s comment suggested the government wanted to cause \u201creputational damage to experts such as Dr David Nicholl who dare to challenge the government or indeed raise legitimate concerns about the impact of no-deal?\u201d Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said Rees-Mogg\u2019s comments were \u201coffensive, irresponsible [and] shameful\u201d. Alistair Burt, a former health minister who had the Tory whip withdrawn on Tuesday after he voted against the government, described Rees-Mogg\u2019s comment as \u201csheer irrationality\u201d. The BMA said Rees-Mogg\u2019s comment was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. In a tweet Nicholl himself said Rees-Mogg\u2019s comment was defamatory. Here is the Guardian\u2019s Politics Weekly podcast. Heather Stewart is joined by Theresa May\u2019s former press secretary Paul Harrison, the psephologist John Curtice and Guardian journalists Jonathan Freedland, Zoe Williams and Larry Elliott to discuss Boris Johnson\u2019s triple Commons defeat, Sajid Javid\u2019s spending review and the likelihood of a snap general election. These are from the BBC\u2019s Damian Grammaticas. @ph_lamberts is Philippe Lamberts, co-president of the Greens/European Free Alliance group in the European parliament and a member of the parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group. Speaking to Boris Johnson earlier, the US vice-president, Mike Pence, claimed that a US-UK trade deal could potentially quadruple the volume of trade between the two countries. Pence said: I spoke to President Trump this morning, your friend, and he sent his very best greetings and to assure you that the United States supports the UK\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. But he also wanted me to convey that the United States is ready, willing and able to immediately negotiate a free trade agreement with the UK. The president often says the US has the biggest economy in the world and we truly believe that a free trade agreement between the United States and the UK could increase trade between our country by three or four times. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman, has strongly condemned the government\u2019s decision to described the Benn bill designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit as a \u201csurrender bill\u201d. His tweet references a comment from Sajid Javid, the chancellor, but it is Boris Johnson who is using the phrase most enthusiastically. The Welsh assembly is has been holding a debate on the Brexit crisis this afternoon. Earlier the first minister Mark Drakeford spoke in Cardiff about his government and Labour\u2019s approach to the crisis. Here are his main points: Drakeford said no-deal Brexit would be \u201cdisastrous\u201d for the economy and rural life in Wales. Asked what citizens would notice in the first week after a no-deal exit, he said travel to Europe would be more difficult, access to some medicines less secure and claimed shoppers would notice goods missing from supermarket shelves. \u201cPeople will rapidly see impacts.\u201d He said Labour wanted a general election. He said: Of course we want a general election. What we\u2019re not prepared to do is sign up to a general election until we are as certain as we possibly can be that this prime minister would not subvert any agreement and still try to find a way to take the UK out of the EU without a deal. He dismissed the idea that during the next general election Welsh Labour should forge pacts with other parties to counter a possible Tory/Brexit Party alliance. He said: I\u2019m instinctively not attracted to them [pacts]. I think it is better than the democratic choices lie in the hands of the voters rather than in deals between parties. I think we have to trust the citizens of Wales to make their decision. He said he would not be releasing the details of Operation Yellowhammer \u2013 the civil contingency planning \u2013 that it is privy to. He said the Yellowhammer papers have been shared with the Welsh government on a confidential basis. On possible problems at Holyhead port on Anglesey \u2013 which links mainland Britain to the Republic of Ireland \u2013 if there is a no deal Brexit, Drakeford said the government\u2019s intelligence suggested that there would be delays of hours rather than days. But he said the position was \u201cinherently volatile\u201d. He said the \u201csmallest changes\u201d could lead to traffic jams stretching off the island on to the north Wales mainland. He stressed that Welsh Labour was a party of remain, even though Wales overall voted leave. He said: We will will continue to argue that Wales\u2019 best interests are best protected by continued membership of the EU. Leaving the EU without a deal will be felt in the lives of every single family and every single community in Wales. Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, has put a message on Twitter saying it \u201chas\u201d been a pleasure to work with Jo Johnson, the outgoing universities minister. Johnson has now been removed from the official list of ministers on the government\u2019s website. But the business department is still unable to confirm that his ministerial resignation will take effect from today. Asked about this, it is just referring reporters to Leadsom\u2019s tweet. Johnson\u2019s own tweet about the timing of his departure was ambiguous. (See 11.26am.) Perhaps Boris Johnson hopes his brother will stay on for a bit? According to the Sun, he begged Jo last night not to quit. The Sun also quotes Jo Johnson saying that, apart from on Brexit, his brother\u2019s policies are excellent. He told the paper: What is so clearly in the national interest is everything the government is doing in its strong, one nation domestic policy agenda: more police on the streets, more doctors and nurses in our hospitals, a welcoming face to scientists and international students. That\u2019s exactly what a Conservative prime minister should be doing and what Boris does so well. Michael Gove is to meet Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, at the weekend for talks on Brexit as tensions mount over Brexit and the Irish border. The meeting, in Cambridge, will take place just before Boris Johnson\u2019s visit to Dublin on Monday when he will meet the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, for the first time since becoming prime minister. From my colleague Jessica Elgot More Labour MPs have been using Twitter to say that the party should not vote for an early election until after an article 50 extension has been agreed. Here are the latest tweets I\u2019ve seen, echoing views from other Labour MPs covered earlier. (See 11.03am and 11.07am.) From Anna McMorrin From Paul Williams From Paul Sweeney From Gareth Thomas From David Lammy From Owen Smith From Ben Bradshaw But Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary and a key ally of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s, has released a video this afternoon saying that the party would be prepared to vote for a general election after the Benn bill has got royal consent. That is what Corbyn told the Commons last night. (See 10.05am.) Here is Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, on Jo Johnson\u2019s decision to stand down. Dame Caroline Spelman, the Conservative former environment secretary, has said she is standing down at the next election. Along with Labour\u2019s Jack Dromey (they are both West Midlands MPs with many constituents working in the car industry), she tabled amendments earlier this year that led to the Commons voting against a no-deal Brexit. (The votes were not binding.) She also rebelled yesterday to back the Benn bill designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit. Downing Street has rejected the claim attributed to Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, that talks with the UK are in \u201ca state of paralysis\u201d. (See 10.33am.) The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: I haven\u2019t seen anything from Michel Barnier on the record but in any event I would completely reject that assessment. Both sides agree to continue talks tomorrow after constructive discussions yesterday and we have seen from EU leaders that there is a willingness to find and agree solutions to the problems we have with the old deal. Boris Johnson has told the US vice-president, Mike Pence, that the NHS would not be for sale in any post-Brexit trade deal and that Britain is \u201cnot keen on that chlorinated chicken\u201d. At a meeting in Downing Street, Johnson said: The National Health Service is not on the table as far as our negotiations go. We are not keen on that chlorinated chicken. More on Jo Johnson. This is from Robert Hutton\u2019s report for Bloomberg. When [Jo Johnson\u2019s] older brother ran for the leadership in the summer, he joined the campaign, apparently having accepted that Britain had to leave the European Union. He took the view that own electoral district of Orpington, on the edge of southeast London, would be likely to fall to the Brexit party unless Britain left, according to a person familiar with his thinking. Privately, he also took the view that Boris Johnson had no interest in a no-deal Brexit, and would seek a deal with the EU and then force hard-line Brexiteers in the party to vote for it. His resignation suggests that view has changed. Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, Lord Carloway, has said confidential Downing Street memos showing Boris Johnson agreed to prorogue parliament 12 days before he asked the Queen might be published. The BBC and News UK, the publisher of the Times and Sun, applied to the court of session on Thursday morning to release three papers written by Nikki da Costa and the prime minister where they secretly agreed the prorogation strategy on 15 August. Three Scottish judges \u2013 Lord Carloway, the lord president, and Lord Drummond-Young and Lord Brodie \u2013 are hearing an appeal by lawyers for 75 MPs and peers against a decision by Lord Doherty yesterday to reject their claims Johnson has illegally prorogued parliament. Carloway said on Thursday morning the court could both order them to be published and released in unredacted form, at the end of the hearing, if he felt they were central to the appeal and it was also in the public interest to do so. The MPs\u2019 lawyer, Aidan O\u2019Neill, revealed earlier this week he had been given three heavily-redacted memos marked \u201cOfficial sensitive Number 10 only\u201d hours before their court hearing on Tuesday, in breach of a court deadline. All three were circulated inside Number 10, including to Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s chief strategist, and Ed Lister, his chief of staff, but no cabinet minister other than Johnson. The first on 15 August from Da Costa setting out their prorogation strategy was ticked by Johnson, with his scribbled note \u201cyes\u201d. He replied the next day with a handwritten note which said: \u201cwhole September session [at Westminster] is a rigmarole introduced to show the public that MPs are earning their crust. I don\u2019t see anything especially shocking about this prorogation.\u201d The UK government said they were blacked out because the censored parts were not relevant or protected by \u201clegal professional privilege\u201d. Andrew Webster QC, for the UK government, told the court it was essential to keep them confidential to preserve cabinet confidentiality. In what O\u2019Neill described as a snub to the Scottish courts, they were not given to the court of session as primary pieces of evidence backed up as affidavits, but were released only because they were being submitted as evidence to the parallel Gina Miller case in London, which started today. Kenny McBrearty QC, appearing for the BBC and News UK, said it was in the public interest and in the interests of open justice for those memos to be published in full. If Number 10 had decided it was appropriate it was to give them to the court, where they were read out in part by O\u2019Neill on Tuesday, then clearly they were not totally confidential. O\u2019Neill has made a separate submission to the three judges, arguing the documents could only be redacted by the court. Downing Street could not unilaterally decide which sections to release, without proper scrutiny. Downing Street had also chosen not to apply for a public interest immunity (PII) certificate \u2013 an orthodox route to keep key documents secret. Asked about Jo Johnson\u2019s resignation at business questions, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, said MPs were used to the idea that people within families might disagree on policy. He pointed out that his own sister, Annunziata, had jointed the Brexit party and got elected as an MEP. In the Commons the Tory MP Sir David Amess has just asked Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, if he agrees that the party conferences could be shortened, to allow the Commons to sit for longer in the autumn. Rees-Mogg did not agree, but John Bercow, the Speaker, enthusiastically backed the idea, saying that it was \u201cbizarre\u201d that so much time was set aside for the meeting of private organisations. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has just told MPs that on Monday the government will hold a second vote on having an early general election. There was a vote last night that was passed, but without the two-thirds majority needed for the vote to lead to an early general election (two thirds of all MPs would have to vote for one, not just two thirds of MPs participating in the division). Under Commons rules the government is not meant to put motions to a vote if they have already been defeated. But government sources say that this would not apply next week because Labour abstained last night on the grounds that the Benn bill, designed to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, was not yet law. But by Monday next week that bill should be law, so the circumstances will have changed, justifying a second vote. Before MPs debate an early election on Monday, Rees-Mogg said they would also consider the remaining stages of the Benn bill, following its return from the Lords, as well as hold a debate required under the Northern Ireland (executive formation) bill. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, issued this statement welcoming Luciana Berger to her party. (See 11.14am.) Swinson said: Luciana is a passionate advocate for women\u2019s and LGBT+ rights, and she\u2019s at the forefront of efforts to counter antisemitism and prevent discrimination. I\u2019m delighted to welcome her to the Liberal Democrats, where we can work together to stop Brexit and build a fairer, more equal society for all. Luciana becomes the fourth MP in three months to cross the floor and join the Liberal Democrats. We\u2019re thrilled to add her perspective, expertise and skills to our ever-growing parliamentary team. The Liberal Democrats are growing in strength as we lead the fight to stop Brexit altogether. We are fully behind a people\u2019s vote, and we are the rallying point for remainers and the liberal centre ground. The other MPs who have joined the Lib Dems recently are Chuka Umunna, Sarah Wollaston and Phillip Lee. And this is what Berger said in a statement about her move. This is a moment of national crisis. The Liberal Democrats are unequivocal in wanting to stop Brexit and are committed to securing Britain\u2019s future as a tolerant, open and inclusive society. I am joining Jo Swinson and the Liberal Democrats today, in the national interest, to offer a vital, positive alternative to Johnson and Corbyn and help build a future that our country deserves. Rachel Johnson, sister of Boris and Jo, claims the family avoids discussing Brexit, especially over meals. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, also raised Jo Johnson at first minister\u2019s questions, the Sun\u2019s Chris Musson reports. Here is Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, on Jo Johnson\u2019s resignation. Boris Johnson poses such a threat that even his own brother doesn\u2019t trust him. We have now had four higher education ministers in two years - just the latest sign of the chaos that the Tories have caused to education and the threat that a disastrous no-deal Brexit poses to our colleges and universities. We need a general election as soon as no-deal is off the table, so that a Labour government can transform our education system and society so they work for the many, not just a privileged few. In the Brexit committee Michael Gove has just finished answering a series of questions about how Dover would cope with lorry arrivals in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Hilary Benn, the committee chair, did not sound hugely reassured, and he concluded by asking Gove to admit that no one actually knows what will happen in the event of no deal. Gove did not contest this, but replied: The future is known only to the Almighty. Benn said unfortunately the Almighty would not be appearing as a witness. Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay has declined to give assurances to Labour that the government is not \u201crowing back\u201d on commitments on Ireland enshrined in the joint report signed by the EU and the UK in December 2017 that bookmarked the end of the first phase of Brexit talks. He was challenged by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, during Brexit questions in the Commons this morning to deny reports that it was \u201crowing back\u201d on the commitments. Barclay replied: There is no rowing back from the Belfast/Good Friday agreement. That\u2019s an area of common accord between us. Starmer reminded him he was asking him about the 2017 joint report, not the peace deal. \u201cI asked a careful question and I got a careful answer and it [the answer] wasn\u2019t to confirm full commitment,\u201d said Starmer. According to reports by RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly, officials in the EU were told that London was trying to reduce its commitments made in the report, which nearly torpedoed talks after the DUP objected to guarantees on north-south trade on the island of Ireland. RTE said officials were told that Boris Johnson was moving from its commitment to \u201cfrictionless trade\u201d to \u201cas frictionless as possible\u201d on the island of Ireland and resisting the agreed ambition for a \u201clegally operable\u201d solution for the island of Ireland and replacing it with \u201caspirational measures\u201d. From Sky\u2019s Adam Parsons This is from the Press Association. A Number 10 spokesman said Jo Johnson had been \u201ca brilliant, talented minister and a fantastic MP\u201d, and the prime minister \u201cas both a politician and brother understands this will not have been an easy matter for Jo\u201d. But No 10 still has not yet clarified whether Jo Johnson is leaving the government today, or at the election. Here is a live feed of Michael Gove giving evidence to the Brexit committee. Gove says the Operation Yellowhammer document, about the government\u2019s assumption for a no-deal Brexit, was presented to a cabinet committee in the first week of August, and discussed on 2 August. But he says that it was produced over a series of months. Q: Why did you describe it as old? Gove says many of the assumptions in the report were old. They had to be tested. Q: You described it as absolutely the worst case scenario. Was that correct? Gove says it was a reasonable worst case scenario. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal planning, has just started giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee. There is a live feed here. Hilary Benn, the chair, is asking the questions. Q: On The Andrew Marr Show you could not say you would comply with the bill designed to stop a no-deal Brexit because you had not seen it. Now you have seen it, will you comply with it? Yes, says Gove. Gove says government will comply with the Benn bill if it becomes law. Jo Johnson has achieved a unique distinction; he is the only minister to have resigned twice over Brexit. In November last year he resigned as a transport minister in Theresa May\u2019s government because he could not support the withdrawal agreement. Other ministers who resigned at the time, like Dominic Raab, did so because they thought the agreement did not amount to a pure enough form of Brexit. Johnson agreed with them that it was an unsatisfactory compromise, but in a long statement explaining his resignation he said there should be a second referendum. He said: Given that the reality of Brexit has turned out to be so far from what was once promised, the democratic thing to do is to give the public the final say. This would not be about re-running the 2016 referendum, but about asking people whether they want to go ahead with Brexit now that we know the deal that is actually available to us, whether we should leave without any deal at all or whether people on balance would rather stick with the deal we already have inside the European Union. To those who say that is an affront to democracy given the 2016 result, I ask this. Is it more democratic to rely on a three-year-old vote based on what an idealised Brexit might offer, or to have a vote based on what we know it does actually entail? A majority of Orpington voters chose to leave the EU in 2016 and many of the close friends I have there, among them hard-working local Conservative party members, are passionately pro-Brexit. I respect their position. But I know from meetings I have had with local members that many are as dismayed as me by the course of negotiations and about the actual choice now on offer. Two-and-a-half years on, the practical Brexit options are now clear and the public should be asked to choose between the different paths facing our country: we will all have different positions on that choice, but I think many in my local party, in the Orpington constituency and around the country would welcome having the last word on the government\u2019s Brexit proposals. This is from Robin Niblett, director of the Chatham House thinktank More on Jo Johnson\u2019s resignation. (Or pending resignation - we\u2019re still not clear when he is actually clearing his ministerial desk.) From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuennsberg From the Labour MEP Theresa Griffin Jo Johnson\u2019s resignation comes as the pound hits a five-week high, on hopes that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided. Sterling has rallied to $1.2345 this morning, its highest level since late July. It has now gained almost four cents since Tuesday, it\u2019s best two-day run in 10 months, as investors welcome efforts to prevent Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal. Our Business Live blog has more details. From the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes Jo Johnson, like his brother Boris, was a journalist before he became MP. Journalists are supposed to express ideas clearly. But his tweet today is loaded with ambiguity. It is not just that it is unclear from what he is saying whether he is resigning as a minister today, or whether he is just saying he will no longer serve in government because within the next few weeks he will no longer by an MP. But he also says he has been \u201ctorn between family loyalty and the national interest\u201d. MPs often decide to leave politics so that can spend more time with their children. Johnson and his wife have two. But in this sentence \u201cfamily loyalty\u201d seems to be a reference to his brother instead. And \u201cnational interest\u201d seems to be an admission that he can no longer support the government\u2019s policies (although, if Johnson were going to take a stand against his brother\u2019s strategy, the obvious time to do it would have been on Tuesday or Wednesday, when MPs were voting on no deal). And No 10 can\u2019t clarify yet whether or not Jo Johnson is leaving the government today, or at the election. The business department won\u2019t say if Jo Johnson is still a minister in their department or not. Johnson is standing down at the next election. But not Boris. It\u2019s Jo, his brother. He has just tweeted this. Johnson has been MP for Orpington since 2010. He also attends cabinet as universities minister. He got promoted even though he voted remain in 2010 and he is much more pro-European than his brother. It is hard to believe that he is comfortable about the idea of a no-deal Brexit, although he has not questioned his brother\u2019s strategy in public. This tweet implies that he is standing down as an MP at the forthcoming election, and leaving the government then, rather than that he is resigning as a minister today, but it is not entirely clear. I will clarify that as soon as I can. Luciana Berger, the former Labour MP who left to join what became Change UK, has joined the Liberal Democrats. She is the second MP to join the Lib Dems this week. On Tuesday the Conservative former minister Phillip Lee crossed the floor to join Jo Swinson\u2019s party. And here is another Labour MP, Ian Murray, saying the party should \u201cgo long\u201d in relation to an early general election (as John McDonnell put it - see 10.05am). Here are three Labour MP saying this morning that the party should not vote for an early general election to take place unless it is taking place after 31 October. From Tonia Antoniazzi From Anna Turley From Catherine McKinnell The Conservative MP Simon Hoare has suggested there was something Stalinist about the purge of 21 Tories who had the whip removed on Tuesday for voting against the government in favour of the move to allow MPs to debate the Benn bill. If you are interested in minute by minute coverage of the high court legal challenge against the government\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks, here are some journalists providing good Twitter updates. Joshua Rozenberg Dominic Casciani Matthew Holehouse Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has told EU diplomats that the Brexit talks are stuck in \u201cparalysis\u201d, the Financial Times is reporting (paywall). It says: The EU\u2019s chief negotiator told envoys from member states that Britain was determined to diverge from EU standards as part of a future trade deal, adding further tension between Mr Johnson\u2019s government and the bloc. According to a leaked diplomatic note seen by the Financial Times, Mr Barnier said: \u201cwe are currently in a state of paralysis\u201d. The warning came on the same day that David Frost, the UK\u2019s chief negotiator, met for more than six hours with his EU counterpart. EU officials said Mr Frost provided no suggestions for how the UK could replace the Irish backstop from the Brexit divorce deal while maintaining an open border in Ireland ... Along with demands on the backstop, Mr Frost has also called for a trade agreement that would allow the UK to break free of EU regulations in areas such as social and environmental standards. The demand reneges on promises made by Theresa May\u2019s government and has emerged as another stumbling bloc in the talks over the past week. Mr Barnier warned EU envoys that any free-trade deal where Britain could undercut Brussels standards would face ratification problems in EU capitals. Some, such as Paris and The Hague, are determined not to allow Britain gain a competitive edge over the EU by undermining the single market after Brexit. One of the UK\u2019s most experienced senior judges, Lord Hope, has predicted that Scottish appeal judges will uphold a ruling that Boris Johnson is legally able to prorogue parliament. Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, acting for 75 MPs and peers and the anti-Brexit Good Law Project, appears before three appeal judges in Edinburgh this morning to urge them to overturn a ruling yesterday by Lord Doherty that Johnson was able under the constitution to suspend parliament. In London lawyers for Gina Miller, the legal campaigner, are appearing at the high court this morning and are also arguing the prime minister acted illegally in a parallel case under English law. Hope, previously a UK supreme court judge and head of the Scottish judiciary, told BBC Radio Scotland he believed both those cases and a similar action in Belfast really belonged at the supreme court. The supreme court is due to hear all three cases on 17 September \u2013 after Johnson is expected to suspend parliament. Hope said the court \u201chad to recover their people, many of whom are abroad, but they will be there in mid-September and the intention is to hear all three jurisdictions together. And I think the judges below [sitting in Edinburgh, London and Belfast] will be quite cautious and I suspect that the decision in Scotland won\u2019t be changed by the [appeal court]. But everything is open in the supreme court, which is where it really belongs. Lord Falconer, the former Labour cabinet minister and lord chancellor, agreed with Hope but said the senior judges hearing today\u2019s case in London may feel bold enough to strike prorogation down. On the Today programme this morning John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, confirmed that Labour has still not settled on when it wants an early election to happen. The easiest way for the PM to hold an early election would be for two-thirds of MPs to vote for one (the threshold set out in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act), but this would require opposition support. An alternative approach would be to legislate to amend the FTPA, but even though this would require just a simple majority, Boris Johnson does not have one at the moment, meaning this route would also require opposition cooperation. At the start of this week Labour faced at least four possible options. 1) Agree an election immediately. 2) Agree an election once the Benn bill designed to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October becomes law, which is now due to happen next Monday. 3) Agree an election once the Benn bill has become law, and Johnson has provided some cast-iron assurance as to when the date will be. 4) Agree an election only after the EU has agreed to extend article 50 beyond the end of October. Assuming the PM did not agree a Brexit deal beforehand (which currently seems unlikely), this means that Labour would not vote for an early election until after 19 October, the deadline in the Benn bill for an article 50 request. The election would then take place in November at the earliest. Labour ruled out 1). But, in the debate last night, Jeremy Corbyn implied that 2) was his position. He told Johnson: \u201cLet [the Benn bill] pass and gain royal assent, and then we will back an election.\u201d But many in the Labour party want the party to wait much longer. And in his interview McDonnell confirmed that the party was considering a delay. He said the party was worried about Johnson trying to change the date. The problem that we had is that we couldn\u2019t determine the date of the election. Of course, Boris Johnson might come along say\u201d \u2018I promise you it will be such and such a date.\u2019 But he\u2019s not renowned ... for delivering on what he says ... We can\u2019t trust him. It\u2019s not just me; it\u2019s his own side. McDonnell said Labour was consulting on how a bill to amend the FTPA could be used to fix the date of a general election. A bill could set 15 October as the date for the election. But McDonnell also said there was a case for holding it later, after the EU summit in October. He said: The problem that we\u2019ve got is that we cannot at the moment have any confidence in Boris Johnson abiding by any commitment or deal that we could construct. That\u2019s the truth of it. So we\u2019re now consulting about whether it\u2019s better to go long, therefore, rather than to go short. And that decision will be taken. Although McDonnell did not acknowledge it, another advantage for Labour in delaying the election until November is that, if Brexit had to be delayed, the Conservatives would get hammered by the Brexit party. Despite what Corbyn said in the debate last night, the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg says Corbyn is saying in private that he is going to wait. General elections are all about choices and what Boris Johnson has been been doing this week has been trying to frame the forthcoming election as a choice between someone who will deliver Brexit by 31 October and someone who won\u2019t. CCHQ could not be clearer about this. This message is also set out in the statement issued by Number 10 this morning. (See 7.48am.) But Johnson is also saying that he wants to get Brexit over so that he can go on to focus on issues like health and education. Here is another extract from the statement Number 10 released to journalists this morning. Since becoming prime minister, Boris has promised more investment for our NHS, more police on our streets to tackle violent crime and more funding for our schools to ensure every child has an excellent education, regardless of where they live. He has already delivered on his promises to level up the country and he wants to continue this agenda. But to do this we must deliver Brexit. There is an irony in this. As one of the leaders of the Vote Leave campaign, you would have thought that Johnson might be proud of Brexit. But now it is as if he is very keen to change the subject. The argument is also flawed, in at least two respects. First, the government does not need to leave the EU to spend more money on public services etc. In fact, all mainstream economic analysis says Brexit will leave less money for these services. And second, even after the UK has left the EU, the argument about Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU will continue for years. Brexit is not going to vanish as a story anytime soon. So why is No 10 pushing this argument? Because voters like to hear it, according to Politico\u2019s Jack Blanchard. Here is an extract from his London Playbook briefing yesterday. [A senior government minister] also predicted the opposition parties are playing straight into [Dominic] Cummings\u2019 hands \u2014 and that the Tories are now on course to win a snap election. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the numbers from CCHQ, it really is black and white,\u201d they said. \u201cPeople want it done. They love it when we talk about schools, hospitals and police; they love it when we talk about broadband; they hate it when we talk about Brexit \u2014 and these people have just voted to talk more about Brexit. Nobody wants to spend three, six months rowing about Brexit.\u201d To repeat, this may well prove to be the case. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. Last night Boris Johnson lost the vote on calling an early election. Rather, he won the vote \u2013 MPs voted in favour by 298 to 56 \u2013 but effectively he lost, because under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, he needed a two-thirds majority, not a simple one. Nothing is straightforward any more. Nevertheless Downing Street is briefing this morning that it considers today to be the first day of the general election campaign. Boris Johnson is making a regional visit, and this afternoon he will be making a speech, and taking questions from journalists. There is plenty more on the agenda. Here is the diary for the day. 9.30am: Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 10am: The high court hears the legal challenge brought by Gina Miller and others against Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks. 10.30am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, makes a Commons statement on next week\u2019s Commons business. 11am: Johnson holds talks with the Israeli PM, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Downing Street. After 11am: Peers will debate a new business motion, designed to ensure that the Benn bill intended to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October passes all its Lords stages by 5pm tomorrow. 12pm: Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal planning, gives evidence to the Commons Brexit committee. 12.15pm: Johnson holds talks with the US vice-president, Mike Pence, in Downing Street. Afternoon: Johnson gives a speech outside London. Damian Green, the former cabinet minister and leader of the One Nation group of Conservatives, has called for the reinstatement of the 21 rebels kicked out of the party. Speaking to the BBC he said: I\u2019m afraid it does look as though somebody has decided that the moderate, progressive wing of the Conservative party is not wanted on voyage. That\u2019s wrong in principle because there are many Conservative traditions, but it is terrible practical politics to narrow your appeal just before a general election. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has refused to deny that he objected to the expulsion of the 21 Tory MPs who voted against the government on bill to block a no deal. Asked on BBC Breakfast about reports of a row in cabinet over the issue, Javid said: I\u2019m not going to get into discussions I\u2019ve had with the prime minister, but I am sad to see 21 colleagues no longer carrying the conservative whip. These are my friends. These are good people. But they also knew that that when the prime minister of the day says a vote is a matter of confidence, what would be the consequences of opposing that. This is not something I wanted to see. But we do need to step back and think about how do we deliver on the central mission to leave the EU by October 31 and continue to govern this country in a way that the people are feeling that their priorities are being met. Javid, who spoke out against proroguing parliament to force through Brexit during the Tory leadership debate, offered muted backing for the move. He said during the leadership debate he was objecting to suspending parliament \u201cfor months\u201d. He added: Proroguing parliament for a Queen\u2019s speech is perfectly correct, especially when there\u2019s plenty of time to debate things as we\u2019ve seen this week. Javid also backed Johnson\u2019s call for an early election: Since the 2017 election, we\u2019ve had a parliament that keeps saying what it doesn\u2019t want when it comes to Brexit, but it is not deciding on what it wants. We\u2019ve just got to the point now that we need to let the people decide who should govern this country. And the choice is going to be clear: they can choose Jeremy Corbyn, and all his dithering and his desire to ignore the will of the people and stay in the EU. Or they can choose Boris Johnson, who will not only deliver on that central promise to leave the EU, but also on the people\u2019s priorities. Boris Johnson appears to be preparing for another lectern moment. A Number 10 spokesman said the prime minister would today \u201cspeak directly to the public, setting out the vital choice that faces our country\u201d. The spokesman added: He will argue that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s \u2018surrender bill\u2019 will force the prime minister to go to Brussels and surrender to any demands they make. This would in essence overturn the biggest democratic vote in our history - the 2016 referendum. The PM will not do this. It is clear the only action is to go back to the people and give them the opportunity to decide what they want: Boris to go to Brussels and get a deal, or leave without one on 31 October or Jeremy Corbyn arriving in Brussels with his surrender bill begging for more delay, more dither and accepting whatever terms Brussels imposes over our nation. For Jeremy Corbyn to continue to avoid an election would be a cowardly insult to democracy. The petition against proroguing parliament, which was signed by more than 1.7m people, will be debated on Monday. It only needed 100,000 signatures to secure a debate. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has played down Keir Starmer\u2019s suggestion that Labour would only back an early election after the bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit has been implemented. Speaking to Sky News, McDonnell said: Keir said that is one of the options, that\u2019s why we are consulting. There\u2019s a range of views in the parliamentary Labour party. But if we are going to have control of the date we\u2019ve got to bring the other opposition parties with us. I think we\u2019ll reach a consensus. But we\u2019ve got to block a no deal. McDonnell said Labour wanted to back an election once the Benn bill seeking an extension to the 31 October Brexit deadline, had passed into law. He said: Jeremy has said once the legislation is through we want a general election ourselves. We are consulting now, so it is all about timing. There\u2019s no tug of war within the Labour party. We are consulting now the other opposition parties. He also accused Boris Johnson of behaving like a toddler in demanding an election now. He said: If you\u2019ve been a parent, this is like dealing with two- or three-year-old having a tantrum ... So you let them have their tantrum and you you have to be the grown-up in the room. And the grown-up in the room is saying: \u2018Fine, have your tantrum, but we are not going to allow you take this country out on a no-deal Brexit, because you will undermine our economy.\u2019 George Monbiot has pointed out the different ways yesterday\u2019s events were covered in the Sun in England and Scotland. Among the more baffling things that happened last night was that Jacob Rees-Mogg posted this video, spoofing him lounging in parliament, onto his official Instagram account. \u2018You great big girl\u2019s blouse\u2019 \u2013 Johnson accused of sexism for remark in debate You may have missed this moment in parliament yesterday with everything that was going on, but at one point during Boris Johnson\u2019s first Prime Minister\u2019s Questions he appeared to call out to Jeremy Corbyn: \u201cCall an election, you great big girl\u2019s blouse.\u201d As my colleague Martin Belam writes, the comment was immediately seized upon on social media, with users suggesting the comment was sexist and not a fitting for the prime minister to say in parliament. Johnson has form for previously using the phrase. In June 2017 he called Labour\u2019s election campaign chief a \u201cbig girl\u2019s blouse\u201d. And in 2007, when Gordon Brown was tipped to be on the verge of calling a general election in an era before the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, he reportedly told a fringe meeting at the Conservative party conference in Blackpool that if Brown didn\u2019t act: \u201cWe will say he\u2019s wimped out, we will say he\u2019s a big girl\u2019s blouse.\u201d Johnson also raised eyebrows by swearing during the course of one of his answers in PMQs, quoting shadow education secretary Angela Rayner\u2019s description of Labour\u2019s economic policy as \u201cshit or bust\u201d. Rayner described Johnson\u2019s performance as dreadful. How the papers covered it Boris Johnson\u2019s failed bid to trigger a general election next month dominates coverage today, with papers either focusing on the humiliation of his defeat, many of which say the prime minister is a \u201ccornered\u201d man, or on Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s refusal to back Johnson\u2019s calls for a vote. Lords agree to push through bill preventing no deal by end of Friday \u2013 video Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of whatever political shenanigans today is going to throw at us. Welcome especially to any members of the House of Lords who might happen to follow this live blog and who had a late night on Wednesday. Our honourable friends in the upper house were up debating the Benn bill until the wee hours when the deadlock finally broke and Lords voted in favour of getting the bill, which rules out a no-deal Brexit and was passed by the House of Commons earlier this week, through all stages of parliament by Friday afternoon, before parliament is suspended by Boris Johnson. That agreement was reached around 1:30am on Thursday when peers passed a business motion that means the Benn bill will be returned to the lower house by 5pm on Friday, ruling out the prospect of attempts at a filibuster. From there, the bill can be voted on again by MPs on Monday and presented for royal assent. Jeremy Corbyn has said he would support calls for a snap general election if the Benn bill preventing a no-deal Brexit received royal assent, so this is a significant step. Peers are set to debate the Benn bill itself and amendments today. We\u2019ll be bringing you news of that debate, and everything else that is going on, as it happens. As I have been throughout the week, I\u2019ll be kicking things off before handing over to my colleagues. Please get in touch via the comments, on Twitter or via email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com). Let\u2019s get cracking.",
