As the Press Association reports, Corbyn spoke to a hundred or so people demonstrating at the Preston New Road site near Blackpool as police officers stood guard. The site is the UK\u2019s only operational shale exploration operation and is controversial in Lancashire after small earth tremors were blamed on the process. </p> <p>Corbyn said fracking, a method of shale gas extraction through hydraulic fracturing underground, would have a damaging effect on the environment. But the boss of Cuadrilla, Francis Egan, said Labour\u2019s policies would leave the UK dependent on imported gas and issued an open invitation for him to visit. Asked if he had any plans to meet the firm\u2019s representatives, Corbyn said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As of this moment no. I\u2019m here to announce our support for ending fracking, but I\u2019m happy to talk to them because I do believe what they are doing is dangerous to our environment.</p> </blockquote> <p>As the Press Association reports, after speaking to demonstrators in a hut where they organise round the clock monitoring of the fracking activities, Corbyn stepped onto a bench to give a speech to protesters. He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I want to see a green industrial revolution in Britain. </p> <p>I want to see sustainability. We cannot go on with this level of CO2 emissions and global warming, otherwise we are all damaged if not doomed. </p> <p>A green industrial revolution will create around 400,000 jobs, high-skilled, good quality, well paid jobs, all around the country. </p> <p>That is a future for our children. </p> <p>We have a short window, as a people, to reduce CO2 emissions, to prevent global warming beyond 1.5C, in order to protect the planet.</p> <p>I want to say well done everyone in Lancashire that opposed fracking here, as in Derbyshire and other places, in Sussex, and the way in which you have made sure the issue is kept alive.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf218b2cd0bc3f93d4bc6f996adabce3808a107c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf218b2cd0bc3f93d4bc6f996adabce3808a107c/0_148_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Corbyn at the Preston New Road shale gas site.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corbyn at the Preston New Road shale gas site.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dae6adc06421dd4c1d9efbe1d235e637a4eb7e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dae6adc06421dd4c1d9efbe1d235e637a4eb7e3/0_184_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Corbyn at the New Road site.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corbyn at the New Road site.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d40665a8f0845f89e31739a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-30T15:51:16.286Z\">4.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from Sky\u2019s <strong>Sam Coates</strong> on what Boris Johnson said to Leo Varadkar in their call.

(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/30/boris-johnson-prime-minister-brexit-news-warned-no-deal-brexit-could-lead-to-farmers-blocking-roads-in-protest-live-news?page=with:block-5d40429e8f08d0b6ca53a8d0#block-5d40429e8f08d0b6ca53a8d0\">2.20pm.)</a> But Johnson claimed that he had had a \u201cvery good\u201d conversation with Varadkar. He went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK, under no circumstances, will have checks at the border in Northern Ireland. We will throw all our energies into sorting out the problems of frictionless trade at the border. We can do it. We have all the sorts of technological solutions that are necessary to do it. But let\u2019s solve those issues in the context of the free trade agreement that we\u2019re going to do after we come out on October 31.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed he had had a \u201cvery good\u201d conversation with Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, today. </strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He stressed that he was not aiming for a no deal Brexit</strong>. But the EU had to accept that the backstop needed to go, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If they understand that then I think we\u2019re going to be at the races. If they can\u2019t compromise, if they really can\u2019t do it, then clearly we have to get ready for a no deal exit, and I think we\u2019ll do it. I think the people of this country are full of resolve and purpose, and we will look after the farming sector.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the UK had to prepare for a no deal Brexit because it was \u201cabsolutely vital\u201d that it had the ability to talk away from the negotiations.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said farmers could get the support they needed in the event of a no deal Brexit. </strong>Asked how the government would help them, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will make sure that they have the support they need, that if there are markets that are going to be tricky, that we help them to find new markets, that we have interventions that are aimed to support them and their incomes. As you know, Defra, the ministry, has done a huge amount already to prepare in advance to 29 March, and will do even more to prepare in the run-up to 31 October, when we come out.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said a lot of adjustments that would be needed for a no deal Brexit would be necessary even if the UK were to leave the EU with a deal. </strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He insisted that he was not engaged in what was effectively the early stage of a general election campaign.</strong></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d97b65969b0921ac21f57786336b0605c119331\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d97b65969b0921ac21f57786336b0605c119331/33_0_895_537/500.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson at a chicken farm in Wales\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson at a chicken farm in Wales</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky News</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d4057b28f0845f89e3172e8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-30T15:09:47.232Z\">4.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Government Brexit policy amounts to 'free lunch' for currency traders, says former Treasury minister</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is what <strong>Jim O\u2019Neill,</strong> the former Goldman Sachs economist and former Treasury minister, told the World at One about how government policies are driving down the value of sterling.

But he went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have got the ingredients of quite a challenge here with the pound. In my many former years [as a Goldman Sachs economist] I would have a little quadrant of different policy combinations and what they would mean for a currency ... In addition to the obviously increased no deal Brexit risk, I think the markets are also now looking at a government that might be leaning on an independent central bank, <a href=\"https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-7277929/Will-leaver-Bank-England-job-Brexiteer-economist-Gerard-Lyons-tipped-Governor.html\">possibly including the choice of its new governor,</a> as well as ... having a free lunch on an expansionary fiscal policy. An expansionary fiscal policy and an expansionary monetary policy combination used to be what one would associate with the Italian lira and Latin American currencies. So those, on top of a no Brexit risk, are essentially all pointing one way for the pound.</p> </blockquote> <p>O\u2019Neill said he was not involved in currency trading any more. But he then went on: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m pretty sure that a lot of big foreign exchange and hedge fund-type people have had a pretty tricky life for the past few years for a whole host of reasons and they are probably looking at what\u2019s being said coming out of the UK as almost close to a free lunch; that you\u2019ve got a government that is deliberately promoting the no deal risk, and one that is talking so adventurously, let\u2019s call it, about monetary and fiscal policy too.

The report says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr Johnson said he did not believe it remotely likely that the EU would want to impose import tariffs on British goods if a deal could not be reached.</p> <p>\u201cObviously we have got to prepare for every scenario possible, but I don\u2019t think there is any chance that the EU would want to start putting tariffs on trade with Britain again, something we have not done since the Napoleonic days of continental Europe,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cPeople need to be confident and courageous, I believe there is plenty of time to come to a trading arrangement that benefits both Britain and the EU.</p> <p>\u201cI think we have got to be a bit less timid and a lot less defeatist in our dealings with the EU.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Johnson is unlikely to try using the same argument again - because it is not true.

Here is an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A question we\u2019re often asked though is, \u2018if we\u2019re self sufficient, why does the UK import so much sheep meat?\u2019 The reasons are numerous and complex but can broadly split into four areas \u2013 historic, market, seasonal and economic.</p> <p>The UK has been importing New Zealand sheep meat for 130 years, with unrestricted imports until 1973 when the UK joined the European Economic Community (EEC). At the time, the UK was only circa 40 per cent self sufficient. To give it some context, prior to joining the EEC, the UK took the vast majority of New Zealand\u2019s lamb exports \u2013 86 per cent in 1970. Today the UK takes around 20 per cent and in 2012 China overtook the UK as the primary destination for New Zealand lamb.</p> <p>From 1972 to 1999, the UK sheep flock grew from 27.9 million head to 44.7 million head, with the UK\u2019s self sufficiency rate increasing to 95 per cent to coincide with increasing production. Increasing production drove rising UK export volumes and, despite a fall in the 2000s, today the UK exports around 100,000 tonnes.</p> <p>However, while the UK market is technically self-sufficient, it is not functionally self sufficient. The UK demands a larger volume of higher end cuts such as legs and chops, while UK exports consist mainly of carcases and a large proportion of low value cuts to emerging markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d4031598f08cf92bb779bc2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-30T12:03:49.607Z\">1.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Johnson reaffirms commitment not to have checks or infrastructure at Irish border in any circumstances</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Downing Street has just sent out the readout of Boris Johnson\u2019s call with Leo Varadkar, his Irish opposite number.

He has explained why<a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/alastair-campbell-s-letter-to-jeremy-corbyn-1-6188152\"> in a 3,000-word open letter to Jeremy Corbyn for the New European. </a>There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/29/jeremy-corbyn-labour-party-brexit\">a shorter version in the Guardian,</a> and my colleague <strong>Rowena Mason</strong> has written it up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/29/alastair-campbell-says-he-no-longer-wishes-to-be-a-labour-member\">here. </a></p> <p>As Campbell explains in his New European article, his conclusion that Labour is not in a position to win a general election with Corbyn as leader has been partly influenced by time he has spent in Australia, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/30/bill-shorten-blames-powerful-vested-interests-for-labors-election-defeat\">Labour lost a general election earlier this year</a> that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/16/essential-poll-majority-of-voters-think-bill-shorten-will-be-the-winner-on-saturday\">it had been widely expected to win. </a>Campbell writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I fear the country may already have decided that it does not intend to make you prime minister. The importance of being clear and honest about that has been underlined to me talking to senior politicians in Australia, where the Labor party has recently lost an election it was almost universally expected to win against a failing, right-wing government. The data was there for all to see - Bill Shorten was not popular enough to win, the country had made up its mind. But the party failed to confront that truth, perhaps because Labor were polling well ahead of the government. Labour in the UK has no such excuse for denial. Both party standing and yours are nowhere near where they need to be, nor anywhere near where Bill Shorten\u2019s and Labor\u2019s were.</p> </blockquote> <p>In an interview on the Today programme this morning, Campbell said that he would not be joining the Liberal Democrats. \u201cI don\u2019t feel I\u2019m close to other parties, but I do think if we do get to a general election and the choice facing the country is Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn all sorts of things are going to happen because that is not a choice that this country finds remotely palatable,\u201d Campbell said. He said he did not know how he would vote at the next general election, but he said that Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, was his local MP, and he described Starmer as \u201ca good MP\u2019. </p> <p>Campbell also said that he wanted to support Labour, but that the party was no longer the one he had supported all his life.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t ever want to vote anything but Labour. But this Labour party is not the Labour party of Clement Attlee, it is not the Labour party of Harold Wilson, it is not the Labour party of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. It has been taken over by people who until recently were communists, they were Stalinists, and they still are, in my view. And I think it\u2019s time to stop pretending, all of us, members, MPs, let\u2019s stop pretending that this is the Labour party that we really believe in.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9e8252f44cd4ff24375322cdbd37f2885d08524\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9e8252f44cd4ff24375322cdbd37f2885d08524/0_13_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alastair Campbell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alastair Campbell</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-30T10:23:29.230Z\">at 11.23am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d4010808f0845f89e316f03\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-30T09:43:29.168Z\">10.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor, <strong>Peter Foster,</strong> has a good Twitter thread that considers how realistic it is for the government to say that farmers can make up for the possible loss of access to the EU market by selling their produce to other countries abroad.

It is not entirely impossible that, within a generation, England might be all that is left.</p> <p>In Northern Ireland the prospect of a no deal Brexit is making Irish reunification look more palatable to some than it has done for years, and Theresa May was so alarmed by this that she eventually concluded a no deal Brexit would be unacceptable. In Scotland the SNP believes that the combination of Brexit and a Johnson premiership could make a second independence referendum easier to win than the last one. Wales is a different prospect; unlike Scotland and Northern Ireland, it voted leave along with England. And in Wales even the nationalists are wary of independence - Plaid Cymru is more of a home rule party, with independence only a long-term goal. But even in Wales opinion is shifting.

He will say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I will always back Britain\u2019s great farmers and as we leave the EU we need to make sure that Brexit works for them.</p> <p>That means scrapping the common agricultural policy and signing new trade deals \u2013 our amazing food and farming sector will be ready and waiting to continue selling ever more not just here but around the world.</p> <p>Once we leave the EU on 31 October, we will have a historic opportunity to introduce new schemes to support farming\u2013 and we will make sure that farmers gets a better deal.</p> <p>Brexit presents enormous opportunities for our country and it\u2019s time we looked to the future with pride and optimism.</p> </blockquote> <p>But not everyone is convinced. On the Today programme this morning Helen Roberts, a sheep farmer in Wales and a regional development officer for the <strong>National Sheep Association,</strong> said a no deal Brexit could lead to farmers in Wales blocking roads in protest. Echoing<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-49066465\"> a comment made by the Farmers Union of Wales</a>, which recently warned that a no deal Brexit could lead to \u201ccivil unrest\u201d, Roberts said a no deal Brexit would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for sheep farmers. She explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At home we have got a flock of 450 ewes. We\u2019ve just started selling the lambs off them for this year. Come the end of October, that\u2019s when we will still be selling them. And to not have a market [because no deal would lead to the imposition of high tariffs by the EU] to sell them into just means there would be no future.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if she thought farmers would really take the fight onto the streets in the event of a no deal Brexit, Roberts replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think they will. I think it is time to stand up for ourselves and be counted. We produce the most wonderful product and we need to be able to sell it and continue farming and looking after the land, like we do best.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked what she meant, and whether she was talking about the possibility of farmers blocking roads with tractors, Roberts said she would expect something like that in the event of a no deal Brexit. </p> <p>Johnson is in Wales this afternoon.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar have clashed over the Irish backstop in their first phone call, with the taoiseach saying the EU is united in the view that it cannot be scrapped and the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened. Boris Johnson has been urged to \u201cstop playing Russian roulette\u201d with the sheep and lamb industry by threatening a no-deal Brexit. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, has told Boris Johnson that a no deal Brexit would be \u201ccatastrophic for Wales\u201d. (See 12.41pm.) The pound has faced renewed selling pressure amid rising fears that Boris Johnson could walk Britain out of the EU without a deal, raising the prospect of rising prices for consumers and hitting holidaymakers in the pocket. Jim O\u2019Neill, the former Treasury minister and former Goldman Sachs banker, has said government policy amounts to a \u201cfree lunch\u201d for currency traders. (See 4.09pm.) Jeremy Corbyn has urged Boris Johnson to ban fracking for gas as research by Labour shows it will stop the UK meeting a net zero target for carbon emissions this century. Cambridge Analytica did work for Leave.EU on the EU referendum, according to emails published by a House of Commons committee, even though the company never received payment for it. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Jeremy Corbyn has snubbed the boss of fracking firm Cuadrilla, meeting protesters instead at the gates of a shale gas exploration site and promising them his party would ban the practice. As the Press Association reports, Corbyn spoke to a hundred or so people demonstrating at the Preston New Road site near Blackpool as police officers stood guard. The site is the UK\u2019s only operational shale exploration operation and is controversial in Lancashire after small earth tremors were blamed on the process. Corbyn said fracking, a method of shale gas extraction through hydraulic fracturing underground, would have a damaging effect on the environment. But the boss of Cuadrilla, Francis Egan, said Labour\u2019s policies would leave the UK dependent on imported gas and issued an open invitation for him to visit. Asked if he had any plans to meet the firm\u2019s representatives, Corbyn said: As of this moment no. I\u2019m here to announce our support for ending fracking, but I\u2019m happy to talk to them because I do believe what they are doing is dangerous to our environment. As the Press Association reports, after speaking to demonstrators in a hut where they organise round the clock monitoring of the fracking activities, Corbyn stepped onto a bench to give a speech to protesters. He said: I want to see a green industrial revolution in Britain. I want to see sustainability. We cannot go on with this level of CO2 emissions and global warming, otherwise we are all damaged if not doomed. A green industrial revolution will create around 400,000 jobs, high-skilled, good quality, well paid jobs, all around the country. That is a future for our children. We have a short window, as a people, to reduce CO2 emissions, to prevent global warming beyond 1.5C, in order to protect the planet. I want to say well done everyone in Lancashire that opposed fracking here, as in Derbyshire and other places, in Sussex, and the way in which you have made sure the issue is kept alive. This is from Sky\u2019s Sam Coates on what Boris Johnson said to Leo Varadkar in their call. (See 1.03pm.) Actually, Johnson has already repudiated the December 2017 joint report. He did so here, in his Commons statement last Thursday. Adrian Masters, ITV Wales\u2019s political editor, has written a Twitter thread explaining why he thought Number 10 were being unduly restrictive in their dealings with the media when Boris Johnson visited the Welsh chicken farm today. It starts here. Boris Johnson has recorded an interview for broadcasters at the chicken farm in Wales. Here are the key points. Johnson insisted that technological solutions were available to provide an alternative to the Irish backstop. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, told Johnson when they spoke today that no \u201csatisfactory\u201d alternatives to the backstop had yet been identified. (See 2.20pm.) But Johnson claimed that he had had a \u201cvery good\u201d conversation with Varadkar. He went on: The UK, under no circumstances, will have checks at the border in Northern Ireland. We will throw all our energies into sorting out the problems of frictionless trade at the border. We can do it. We have all the sorts of technological solutions that are necessary to do it. But let\u2019s solve those issues in the context of the free trade agreement that we\u2019re going to do after we come out on October 31. He claimed he had had a \u201cvery good\u201d conversation with Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, today. He stressed that he was not aiming for a no deal Brexit. But the EU had to accept that the backstop needed to go, he said: If they understand that then I think we\u2019re going to be at the races. If they can\u2019t compromise, if they really can\u2019t do it, then clearly we have to get ready for a no deal exit, and I think we\u2019ll do it. I think the people of this country are full of resolve and purpose, and we will look after the farming sector. He said the UK had to prepare for a no deal Brexit because it was \u201cabsolutely vital\u201d that it had the ability to talk away from the negotiations. He said farmers could get the support they needed in the event of a no deal Brexit. Asked how the government would help them, he replied: We will make sure that they have the support they need, that if there are markets that are going to be tricky, that we help them to find new markets, that we have interventions that are aimed to support them and their incomes. As you know, Defra, the ministry, has done a huge amount already to prepare in advance to 29 March, and will do even more to prepare in the run-up to 31 October, when we come out. He said a lot of adjustments that would be needed for a no deal Brexit would be necessary even if the UK were to leave the EU with a deal. He insisted that he was not engaged in what was effectively the early stage of a general election campaign. This is what Jim O\u2019Neill, the former Goldman Sachs economist and former Treasury minister, told the World at One about how government policies are driving down the value of sterling. (See 2.29pm.) O\u2019Neill started by stressing that it was hard to predict what currencies would do, and that the value of currencies could go up as well as down. But he went on: We have got the ingredients of quite a challenge here with the pound. In my many former years [as a Goldman Sachs economist] I would have a little quadrant of different policy combinations and what they would mean for a currency ... In addition to the obviously increased no deal Brexit risk, I think the markets are also now looking at a government that might be leaning on an independent central bank, possibly including the choice of its new governor, as well as ... having a free lunch on an expansionary fiscal policy. An expansionary fiscal policy and an expansionary monetary policy combination used to be what one would associate with the Italian lira and Latin American currencies. So those, on top of a no Brexit risk, are essentially all pointing one way for the pound. O\u2019Neill said he was not involved in currency trading any more. But he then went on: I\u2019m pretty sure that a lot of big foreign exchange and hedge fund-type people have had a pretty tricky life for the past few years for a whole host of reasons and they are probably looking at what\u2019s being said coming out of the UK as almost close to a free lunch; that you\u2019ve got a government that is deliberately promoting the no deal risk, and one that is talking so adventurously, let\u2019s call it, about monetary and fiscal policy too. The world I was in, a lot of them are saying, \u2018Thank goodness for Boris, he\u2019s giving us a chance to make some money.\u2019 Boris Johnson has been visiting a chicken farm in Wales. Coincidentally Johnson visit coincides with the Daily Mirror splashing on the news that Lee Cain, his director of communications, used to pursue Tory politicians dressed as a chicken as a tabloid stunt when he was working for the paper during the 2010 general election. According to Downing Street, apart from a few Lords appointments, the government reshuffle has now been completed. In due course a full list of ministers should appear on the government\u2019s website here. Number 10 has also sent out a list of all the ministers who have, as they put it, \u201cleft the government\u201d. That means it\u2019s mostly a list of ministers who have been sacked, although some may have refused to accept demotions, like Jeremy Hunt, and others may have indicated they wanted to go, like Chris Grayling. This list understates the full scale of change because it does not include four ministers who resigned before Boris Johnson had the chance to sack them: Philip Hammond, the chancellor; David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister; David Gauke, the justice secretary; Rory Stewart, the international development secretary. Here is the Number 10 list of ministers who have left the government. Cabinet ministers who have gone (10) Jeremy Hunt, foreign secretary Penny Mordaunt, defence secretary Liam Fox, international trade secretary Greg Clark, business secretary Chris Grayling, transport secretary Damian Hinds, education secretary James Brokenshire, housing secretary Jeremy Wright, culture secretary Karen Bradley, Northern Ireland secretary David Mundell, Scottish secretary Ministers attending cabinet who have gone (3) Mel Stride, leader of the Commons Claire Perry, energy minister Caroline Nokes, immigration minister Other ministers (10) Stephen Hammond, health minister George Hollingberry, international trade minister John Penrose, Northern Ireland minister Mark Field, Foreign Office minister Robert Goodwill, environment minister Harriet Baldwin, Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood, defence minister Jackie Doyle-Price, health minister Andrew Jones, transport minister Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth, a housing minister According to Dan Bloom at the Mirror, Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser on Brexit, David Frost, argued earlier this year that it would be a mistake for the UK to agree to continue matching EU rules on workers\u2019 rights after Brexit. In his first speech as prime minister, a week ago tomorrow, Boris Johnson declared: The people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts. But it turns out, because of the way Johnson\u2019s government has talked up the prospect of a no deal Brexit, currency traders are doing quite well betting against Britain. At least, that\u2019s what Jim O\u2019Neill, the former Goldman Sachs economist and former Treasury minister, told the World at One. Here is the Irish government\u2019s readout of Boris Johnson\u2019s conversation with Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach. It says Varadkar told Johnson that the EU was \u201cunited in its view that the withdrawal agreement could not be reopened\u201d and that no \u201csatisfactory\u201d alternatives to the backstop had yet been identified. When Boris Johnson is in Wales this afternoon, he is likely to be asked what will happen to Welsh farmers if a no deal Brexit leads to the EU imposing tariffs on meat imports. According to this report from the Shropshire Star, when Johnson was asked about this during the Tory leadership campaign last month, he claimed that in practice there would be no tariffs. The report says: Mr Johnson said he did not believe it remotely likely that the EU would want to impose import tariffs on British goods if a deal could not be reached. \u201cObviously we have got to prepare for every scenario possible, but I don\u2019t think there is any chance that the EU would want to start putting tariffs on trade with Britain again, something we have not done since the Napoleonic days of continental Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople need to be confident and courageous, I believe there is plenty of time to come to a trading arrangement that benefits both Britain and the EU. \u201cI think we have got to be a bit less timid and a lot less defeatist in our dealings with the EU.\u201d Johnson is unlikely to try using the same argument again - because it is not true. Under WTO trade rules, without a trade deal, the EU could not drop tariffs for meat imports from the UK without dropping them for everyone else. Thanks to tangerineblue in the comments for flagging this up. Here is a question from below the line that is worth addressing. The best explanation I\u2019ve read is this one, from the Beef and Lamb Matters blog. Here is an extract. A question we\u2019re often asked though is, \u2018if we\u2019re self sufficient, why does the UK import so much sheep meat?\u2019 The reasons are numerous and complex but can broadly split into four areas \u2013 historic, market, seasonal and economic. The UK has been importing New Zealand sheep meat for 130 years, with unrestricted imports until 1973 when the UK joined the European Economic Community (EEC). At the time, the UK was only circa 40 per cent self sufficient. To give it some context, prior to joining the EEC, the UK took the vast majority of New Zealand\u2019s lamb exports \u2013 86 per cent in 1970. Today the UK takes around 20 per cent and in 2012 China overtook the UK as the primary destination for New Zealand lamb. From 1972 to 1999, the UK sheep flock grew from 27.9 million head to 44.7 million head, with the UK\u2019s self sufficiency rate increasing to 95 per cent to coincide with increasing production. Increasing production drove rising UK export volumes and, despite a fall in the 2000s, today the UK exports around 100,000 tonnes. However, while the UK market is technically self-sufficient, it is not functionally self sufficient. The UK demands a larger volume of higher end cuts such as legs and chops, while UK exports consist mainly of carcases and a large proportion of low value cuts to emerging markets. Downing Street has just sent out the readout of Boris Johnson\u2019s call with Leo Varadkar, his Irish opposite number. Here it is in full. The taoiseach congratulated the prime minister on his appointment and both leaders underscored their commitment to working closely together in the spirit of the warm and deep relationship between the UK and Ireland. On the process of restoring the executive and assembly in Northern Ireland, both leaders expressed their determination to see this happen as quickly as possible. The prime minister said the ongoing talks have his unequivocal support and that he wanted to continue to work closely with the Irish government to help drive the process towards a successful conclusion. He said he looked forward to visiting Northern Ireland shortly and talking to the leaders of the five main parties about this. On Brexit, the prime minister made clear that the UK will be leaving the EU on October 31, no matter what. He said that in all scenarios, the government will be steadfast in its commitment to the Belfast agreement and will never put physical checks or physical infrastructure on the border. The prime minister made clear that the government will approach any negotiations which take place with determination and energy and in a spirit of friendship, and that his clear preference is to leave the EU with a deal, but it must be one that abolishes the backstop. The two leaders agreed to stay in contact. \u201cBoosterism\u201d may turn out to be a more accurate description of Boris Johnson\u2019s modus operandi than his team thought then they briefed the Daily Mail about it. See the update to my 11.39am post for more. This is from Mark Drakeford, the Labour first minister of Wales, who is meeting Boris Johnson later. Six days after becoming prime minister, Boris Johnson has finally spoken to Leo Vardakdar, his Irish opposite number and one of the most important EU leaders in the Brexit negotiations, the Irish Times\u2019s Denis Staunton reports. Yesterday Johnson was criticised for not already have spoken to the taoiseach. Sinn Fein\u2019s president, Mary Lou McDonald, has given a major speech in Belfast this morning on the subject of Brexit and Irish unity. You can read the full text here, but here are the main points. McDonald said there was increasing support for Irish unity in the north because of Brexit. She said: Political unionism has lost its electoral majority in a series of consecutive elections. The nationalist people of the north have turned their backs on Westminster and increasingly look to Dublin for leadership. Brexit has forced increasing numbers of people, from all backgrounds, to look south ... A growing number of people in the north, including many from a unionist background, are now considering their future in the context of Brexit. Many are now open to discussing the prospect of a new Ireland, an agreed Ireland and united Ireland. She said the Irish government should now start planning for the reunification of Ireland. She said: Last Friday an taoiseach told the MacGill summer school that the government would have to consider a forum on Irish unity in the event of a no deal Brexit. While the taoiseach has the responsibility to lead the debate on Irish Unity he should appoint an Irish government minister of state with the dedicated and specific responsibility of developing strategies to advance Irish unity and coordinating the government\u2019s all-Ireland policies. The government has to begin planning for unity. Creating the environment for the necessary conversation and discussion to take place. Looking at the steps needed to demonstrate that unity is in the best interest of all, economically viable, and welcoming for unionists, and all citizens. A forum which is open to all strands of political opinion on this island can only be a good initiative. She said the return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland would oblige the government to hold a referendum on Irish unity. Under the terms of the Good Friday agreement, the UK government is obliged to hold a referendum, or \u201cborder poll\u201d, if at any time it seems \u201clikely\u201d that a majority in the north would vote to form part of a united Ireland. McDonald said: If the British government have factored into their calculations a hard border, then they must factor in a unity referendum as laid out in the Good Friday agreement. The route back for the north into the EU is clear. Irish unity is the route back to the EU. We will be meeting Boris Johnston in the coming days. We will remind him not only of the need to respect the wishes of the majority to remain within the EU. We will also remind him of his obligations under the Good Friday and subsequent agreements including the provision for a unity referendum Brexit has re-exposed the folly of partition and reinforced the need for Irish unity. Sinn F\u00e9in makes no apology for promoting our vision of a united Ireland. She said that \u201clittle progress\u201d had been made in the talks on restoring the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland. She said there were three outstanding issues. The outstanding issues remain the outstanding issues. They are not intractable and do not give any section of the community a win over another section of the community. This is not a game in which a score is kept. Marriage equality for our LGBT brothers and sisters does not denigrate the rights of others to marry. Respecting the rights of Irish speakers does not diminish anyone\u2019s sense of Britishness. Resolving the past and promoting reconciliation is a threat to no one. This round of talks to restore the power sharing government have thus far failed to achieve agreement. This is because these key issues have not been faced up to yet. She said that introducing direct rule in Northern Ireland - something the government has not ruled out in the event of a no deal Brexit - would be \u201ca huge threat\u201d to all the people of the island of Ireland. She said there was no contradiction between having a functioning Northern Ireland executive and assembly and also planning for Irish reunification. And here is the BBC\u2019s Gareth Gordon on the speech. Here is Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, on the logic of the government\u2019s position on the likelihood of no deal. According to Jason Groves in the Daily Mail, Boris Johnson has not just an economic philosophy, but a word for it - \u201cboosterism\u201d. Groves explains it here: Senior Tories said the new prime minister had made it clear he wants \u2018rocket boosters\u2019 placed under the economy in the run up to Brexit, with a huge investment in infrastructure and an end to the tight austerity spending rules that have characterised the last decade. Senior City sources say that Mr Johnson\u2019s economic credo combines a Blairite enthusiasm for infrastructure spending, coupled with a Thatcherite belief in the power of tax cuts to stimulate the economy. One said: \u2018He was asked to explain his economic philosophy and said, in a word: Boosterism.\u2019 It sounds a bit like Reaganomics - combination of tax cuts and high spending, funded by increased borrowing. UPDATE: In the comments OldSynner says that \u201cboosterism\u201d already exists as a concept, at least according to Wikipedia. But Wikipedia suggests it is not something to be proud of. It says: During the expansion of the American and Canadian West, boosterism became epidemic as the leaders and owners of small towns made extravagant predictions for their settlement, in the hope of attracting more residents and, not coincidentally, inflating the prices of local real estate. Reminder: in his first speech to the Commons as PM last week, Johnson said his mission was to make the UK \u201cthe greatest place on earth\u201d. Labour did not respond when asked for a comment on Alastair Campbell\u2019s article yesterday. (See 11.21am.) But if you want to know what Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office think, you could do worse than read these tweets from Steve Howell, who worked for Corbyn as deputy communications director during the 2017 general election campaign. Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s former communications chief, has announced today that he no longer wants to be a member of the Labour party. He has explained why in a 3,000-word open letter to Jeremy Corbyn for the New European. There is a shorter version in the Guardian, and my colleague Rowena Mason has written it up here. As Campbell explains in his New European article, his conclusion that Labour is not in a position to win a general election with Corbyn as leader has been partly influenced by time he has spent in Australia, where Labour lost a general election earlier this year that it had been widely expected to win. Campbell writes: I fear the country may already have decided that it does not intend to make you prime minister. The importance of being clear and honest about that has been underlined to me talking to senior politicians in Australia, where the Labor party has recently lost an election it was almost universally expected to win against a failing, right-wing government. The data was there for all to see - Bill Shorten was not popular enough to win, the country had made up its mind. But the party failed to confront that truth, perhaps because Labor were polling well ahead of the government. Labour in the UK has no such excuse for denial. Both party standing and yours are nowhere near where they need to be, nor anywhere near where Bill Shorten\u2019s and Labor\u2019s were. In an interview on the Today programme this morning, Campbell said that he would not be joining the Liberal Democrats. \u201cI don\u2019t feel I\u2019m close to other parties, but I do think if we do get to a general election and the choice facing the country is Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn all sorts of things are going to happen because that is not a choice that this country finds remotely palatable,\u201d Campbell said. He said he did not know how he would vote at the next general election, but he said that Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, was his local MP, and he described Starmer as \u201ca good MP\u2019. Campbell also said that he wanted to support Labour, but that the party was no longer the one he had supported all his life. I don\u2019t ever want to vote anything but Labour. But this Labour party is not the Labour party of Clement Attlee, it is not the Labour party of Harold Wilson, it is not the Labour party of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. It has been taken over by people who until recently were communists, they were Stalinists, and they still are, in my view. And I think it\u2019s time to stop pretending, all of us, members, MPs, let\u2019s stop pretending that this is the Labour party that we really believe in. The Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor, Peter Foster, has a good Twitter thread that considers how realistic it is for the government to say that farmers can make up for the possible loss of access to the EU market by selling their produce to other countries abroad. It starts here. And here are two of his key tweets. On the Today programme this morning Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary, stressed that the government was trying to avoid a no deal Brexit. He also said, after Brexit, there would be opportunities for farmers to sell their produce outside the EU. He explained: We are now looking to the growth that will come from right around the world, 90% of global growth will come from outside of the EU, but we don\u2019t want to close our back on the European market either and that\u2019s why working hard to get a deal is important, but of course there needs to be a shift in attitude and a positive response to the cause that we\u2019re making. But Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers\u2019 Union, said that the government should be doing more to open up opportunities for farmers. She told the programme: Government buying standards, government contracts at the moment - those are not based on British sourcing at all and they could be. We could look at and should be looking right now at opening up market opportunities in China, but that isn\u2019t happening. There\u2019s also opportunities in the United States that could be happening right now, but it isn\u2019t happening. The prospect of a no deal Brexit is also spooking the currency markets. As my colleague Jasper Jolly reports on the business live blog, renewed selling this morning has left the pound just a percent away from hitting a 34-year low. There is more on the blog here. Here is my colleague Rowena Mason\u2019s story on what Welsh farmers are saying to Boris Johnson ahead of his visit to the country later today. Recently Donald Trump spoke about his first phone call with Boris Johnson after Johnson became prime minister. His comments included this fascinating aside. We don\u2019t do the kind of trade we could do with - what some people say is Great Britain, and some people remember - a word you don\u2019t hear too much is England, which is a piece of it. It would be easy to put this down to simple US confusion about the name of the country that Johnson presides over (understandable confusion - it is not straightforward). But with Brexit posing perhaps the biggest threat to the preservation of the union of the United Kingdom for a century, perhaps Trump was being more prescient than he realised. It is not entirely impossible that, within a generation, England might be all that is left. In Northern Ireland the prospect of a no deal Brexit is making Irish reunification look more palatable to some than it has done for years, and Theresa May was so alarmed by this that she eventually concluded a no deal Brexit would be unacceptable. In Scotland the SNP believes that the combination of Brexit and a Johnson premiership could make a second independence referendum easier to win than the last one. Wales is a different prospect; unlike Scotland and Northern Ireland, it voted leave along with England. And in Wales even the nationalists are wary of independence - Plaid Cymru is more of a home rule party, with independence only a long-term goal. But even in Wales opinion is shifting. Recently the Labour first minister, Mark Drakeford, said that Wales\u2019s support for the union was not unconditional, and only yesterday an opinion poll put Plaid Cymru ahead in voting intention for the Welsh assembly for the first time ever. After his visit to Scotland yesterday, Johnson, who has given himself the title \u201cminister for the union\u201d alongside the title prime minister, is in Wales, and, according to a statement released by Number 10 overnight, he will tell Welsh farmers they have a bright future after Brexit. He will say: I will always back Britain\u2019s great farmers and as we leave the EU we need to make sure that Brexit works for them. That means scrapping the common agricultural policy and signing new trade deals \u2013 our amazing food and farming sector will be ready and waiting to continue selling ever more not just here but around the world. Once we leave the EU on 31 October, we will have a historic opportunity to introduce new schemes to support farming\u2013 and we will make sure that farmers gets a better deal. Brexit presents enormous opportunities for our country and it\u2019s time we looked to the future with pride and optimism. But not everyone is convinced. On the Today programme this morning Helen Roberts, a sheep farmer in Wales and a regional development officer for the National Sheep Association, said a no deal Brexit could lead to farmers in Wales blocking roads in protest. Echoing a comment made by the Farmers Union of Wales, which recently warned that a no deal Brexit could lead to \u201ccivil unrest\u201d, Roberts said a no deal Brexit would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for sheep farmers. She explained: At home we have got a flock of 450 ewes. We\u2019ve just started selling the lambs off them for this year. Come the end of October, that\u2019s when we will still be selling them. And to not have a market [because no deal would lead to the imposition of high tariffs by the EU] to sell them into just means there would be no future. Asked if she thought farmers would really take the fight onto the streets in the event of a no deal Brexit, Roberts replied: I think they will. I think it is time to stand up for ourselves and be counted. We produce the most wonderful product and we need to be able to sell it and continue farming and looking after the land, like we do best. Asked what she meant, and whether she was talking about the possibility of farmers blocking roads with tractors, Roberts said she would expect something like that in the event of a no deal Brexit. Johnson is in Wales this afternoon. And Jeremy Corbyn is also on a visit today. He is due to meet anti-fracking protesters at Cuadrilla\u2019s Preston New Road site. Otherwise the diary is fairly empty. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Congratulations came from across parliament; and there were supportive emails from the public. They liked not just its bold call for a multibillion-pound, taxpayer-funded, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/04/peers-call-for-extra-8bn-to-tackle-social-care-scandal\" title=\"\">NHS-style overhaul of adult social care</a>, but its brisk frustration with the political failure of successive governments to address what it concluded (after a brief deliberation about whether such language was appropriately lordly) was a \u201cnational scandal\u201d.</p> <p>The solution was admirably simple: write an \u00a38bn cheque to local authorities in England and Wales to pull adult social care budgets back to pre-austerity 2010 levels; and create by 2025 a \u00a37bn a year system of free personal care to help people with daily tasks such as bathing, dressing, personal hygiene, going to the toilet, and meal preparation. Importantly, the cash would be distributed via a central grant, removing postcode lotteries in standards of provision. Above all, robust action was needed, and quickly: as Lord Forsyth said at the launch of the report earlier this month: \u201cLet\u2019s stop faffing around.\u201d</p> <p>Any initial concerns the peers had that their demands for an extra \u00a315bn a year by 2025 were unrealistic were quickly drowned out by copious evidence of a broken system, he says. About 1.4 million people are denied the social care they need because of cuts, rationing and means tests. Many more endured basic \u201cclean and feed\u201d levels of care. The system is riddled with unfairness and inequality, and the gap between demand and resources is growing apace. People are suffering. \u201cYou would have to be blind and totally excluded from society not to be able to read or see that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/26/social-care-funding-crisis-putting-tens-of-thousands-at-risk\" title=\"\">system is failing</a>. We all know the system is failing,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Equally, some will have been surprised by the enthusiasm with which Forsyth \u2013 a former minister in John Major\u2019s government \u2013 embraced this most statist of solutions. Forsyth less so. \u201cI\u2019m regarded as a rightwinger, as a Thatcherite,\u201d he admits. \u201cI believe in politics that the first duty of parliament is the defence of the nation but also to ensure, as Winston Churchill put it, to provide a net and a ladder; a net below which people do not fall and a ladder to help them get out of the net. Here you have people who can\u2019t climb ladders and the net is full of holes.\u201d</p> <p>The committee\u2019s proposals were built on solid evidence, he says \u2013 \u201cwhich I suppose these days is something of a novelty in terms of public policy\u201d. So, private insurance solutions favoured by many in his own party were quickly dispatched, after the insurance industry told the committee they wouldn\u2019t work. Half the social care budget is spent on people of working age, so insurance schemes would not help them. They were just a diversion from the reality that a properly functioning social care system is the expensive duty of the taxpayer, not of markets, says Forsyth. \u201cThe people who are looking for some easy way out of this are in search of a holy grail which does not exist.\u201d</p> <p>If confirmation were needed that the system was crumbling, it came in the private testimony given to the committee by care workers, he says. He was struck by their dedication despite low pay, low status, the lack of a career structure, and the dearth of support available to them. You can\u2019t blame employers for this, he says, \u201ctrying to squeeze a pint into a half-pint pot\u201d. It all comes back to financing. \u201cThey [the carers] know that people are denied care not because the local authorities or anyone wants to be beastly but simply because they are having to ration resources in the face of increasing demands.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/27/care-for-the-elderly-boris-johnson-jeremy-hunt\">Care for the elderly is a scandal \u2013 but don\u2019t expect a solution from Hunt or Johnson | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The committee expressly set out not to produce yet another worthy social care funding report \u2013 there have been 17 in the last 20 years, all of which were ignored or abandoned \u2013 but to create a blueprint that was acceptable to both Labour and the Tories. He is conscious of the way both parties have weaponised social care reforms in past elections: Labour\u2019s plans dubbed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/mar/30/death-tax-haunts-andy-burnham-care-revolution\" title=\"\">\u201cdeath tax\u201d</a> in 2010; Theresa May\u2019s plans vilified as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/22/theresa-may-u-turn-on-dementia-tax-cap-social-care-conservative-manifesto\" title=\"\">dementia tax</a> in 2017. May\u2019s were \u201ccrackpot\u201d proposals anyway, he reflects: \u201cYou don\u2019t try and get a policy which requires consensus among the political parties and launch it in the middle of an election campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Several days after our interview, Boris Johnson promised in his first utterances as prime minister to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-announced-plan-fix-18770005\" title=\"\">fix the crisis </a>in social care\u201d. There has been speculation that his plan may adopt an insurance-style approach. Forsyth said Johnson should take note of the committee\u2019s emphasis on funding the social care needs of working-age adults, and the importance of paying for it through taxation, warning: \u201cAny plan which relies mainly on private insurance will not work, even with a pensions-style auto-enrolment scheme.\u201d</p> <p>By convention the government must formally respond to the committee within eight weeks; and a debate on the floor of the Lords should take place before Christmas. Brexit or no Brexit, there is simply no time to waste, Forsyth says. If the government is serious about social care reform it cannot possibly avoid the committee\u2019s conclusions. \u201cThis is a broken system, we are reaching the end of the road.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Curriculum vitae</strong></p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 64.</p> <p><strong>Lives:</strong> London.</p> <p><strong>Family:</strong> Married, three children.</p> <p><strong>Education:</strong> Arbroath high school, Arbroath, Angus, Scotland; University of St Andrews (1972-76).</p> <p><strong>Career:</strong> 2017-present: chairman of the Lords economic affairs committee; 1999-present: member of the House of Lords; 2005-12: Evercore Partners International LLP; 2002-05: deputy chairman of JP Morgan; 1999-2001: vice-chairman, Investment Banking Europe at JP Morgan; 1995-97: secretary of state for Scotland; 1994-95: minister for home affairs; 1992-94: employment minister; 1990-92: minister of state for Scotland; 1983-97: MP for Stirling.</p> <p><strong>Public life:</strong> president of the Steamboat Association of Great Britain; founder of the Pimlico Tree and Preservation Trust (now the Westminster Tree Trust); former president of the Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland.</p> <p><strong>Interests:</strong> Mountaineering, fly-fishing, skiing and astronomy.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 August 2019 because private insurance solutions, not social insurance solutions as an earlier version said, which were favoured by many in the Conservative party were quickly dispatched.

It all comes back to financing. \u201cThey [the carers] know that people are denied care not because the local authorities or anyone wants to be beastly but simply because they are having to ration resources in the face of increasing demands.\u201d The committee expressly set out not to produce yet another worthy social care funding report \u2013 there have been 17 in the last 20 years, all of which were ignored or abandoned \u2013 but to create a blueprint that was acceptable to both Labour and the Tories. He is conscious of the way both parties have weaponised social care reforms in past elections: Labour\u2019s plans dubbed a \u201cdeath tax\u201d in 2010; Theresa May\u2019s plans vilified as a dementia tax in 2017. May\u2019s were \u201ccrackpot\u201d proposals anyway, he reflects: \u201cYou don\u2019t try and get a policy which requires consensus among the political parties and launch it in the middle of an election campaign.\u201d Several days after our interview, Boris Johnson promised in his first utterances as prime minister to \u201cfix the crisis in social care\u201d. There has been speculation that his plan may adopt an insurance-style approach. Forsyth said Johnson should take note of the committee\u2019s emphasis on funding the social care needs of working-age adults, and the importance of paying for it through taxation, warning: \u201cAny plan which relies mainly on private insurance will not work, even with a pensions-style auto-enrolment scheme.\u201d By convention the government must formally respond to the committee within eight weeks; and a debate on the floor of the Lords should take place before Christmas. Brexit or no Brexit, there is simply no time to waste, Forsyth says. If the government is serious about social care reform it cannot possibly avoid the committee\u2019s conclusions. \u201cThis is a broken system, we are reaching the end of the road.\u201d Curriculum vitae Age: 64.
