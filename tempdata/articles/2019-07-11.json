Despite having been appointed when Hillary Clinton was thought likely to win the presidency, Darroch threw himself into courting Trump\u2019s inner circle, \u201cflooding the zone\u201d of people in Trump\u2019s orbit, hoping to gain influence through showing up and cultivating contacts. He also worked hard to court well-connected American journalists so he could benefit from their insights.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In July 2019, Darroch resigned as ambassador, after a series of leaked diplomatic messages revealed that he had described the administration as \"inept\" and \"clumsy\". This led to a vocal Twitter outburst from Trump. Darroch could never have imagined that his distinguished 40-year diplomatic career would end with a US president publicly volleying insults&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/09/donald-trump-calls-theresa-may-foolish-as-diplomatic-row-escalates\">his way, calling him \u201ca very stupid guy\u201d, \u201cwacky\u201d and \u201cpompous fool\u201d</a>.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rowena-mason\"><b>Rowena Mason</b></a>&nbsp;<i>in London</i> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidsmith\"><b>David Smith</b></a>&nbsp;<i>in Washington</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Asked why he had been less willing to offer such clear public backing before Darroch felt moved to resign, Johnson said: \u201cI must say that I think there has certainly been an attempt to politicise this issue and to take the career prospects of Sir Kim and turn them into an issue in the Conservative leadership contest. I notice that.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat I will say is that I don\u2019t think that should happen and, as I said in the debate, I don\u2019t think that issues of personnel in our civil service should become footballs in political conversations and just as the advice that civil servants give to ministers should be sacrosanct and ministers should not reveal it and should not betray it.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the background, there is also a fierce wrangle over who should replace Darroch in Washington and, crucially, whether the decision should be taken by May or her successor.</p> \n<p>At an urgent Commons question about the affair, a series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/11/tory-mps-condemn-boris-johnson-over-kim-darroch-resignation\">Tory MPs lined up to criticise Johnson</a>, who repeatedly refused to back Darroch after Trump insulted the ambassador <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/09/donald-trump-calls-theresa-may-foolish-as-diplomatic-row-escalates\">in a series of tweets</a> and said he would no longer deal with him.</p> \n<p>One Conservative backbencher, David Morris, said Johnson, a former foreign secretary, should make a formal apology to parliament. \u201cDo you not feel that it is incumbent on every member of parliament in this place to back up our excellent diplomats and civil servants, and the honourable member for Uxbridge should come to the house and apologise?\u201d he asked.</p> \n<p>Adding to the likely discomfort of the Johnson camp, the Foreign Office minister tasked with responding to the urgent question was Sir Alan Duncan, who had the day before accused Johnson of throwing Darroch \u201cunder the bus\u201d.</p> \n<p>Johnson has praised Darroch but stayed otherwise silent after declining several times during a Tory leadership TV debate on Tuesday night to offer support, something friends of Darroch said was a key element in the ambassador\u2019s decision to resign the next day.</p> \n<p>One of Johnson\u2019s leading allies, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, spoke up for him on Thursday, telling a journalists\u2019 lunch that while she did not like overseas leaders such as Trump \u201cslagging off\u201d the UK, she agreed with the US president\u2019s criticism of May\u2019s Brexit deal.</p> \n<p>On the timing for appointing a new ambassador, Truss predicted this would take months and so it would be a job for the next prime minister.</p> \n<p>On Thursday evening, Johnson talked up the importance of the maintaining a working relationship with Washington, but insisted that there were circumstances in which he would publicly criticise Trump.</p> \n<p>He pointed to his response to Trump\u2019s claim in 2015 that some parts of London were \u201cso radicalised that police are afraid for their own lives\u201d. At the time, Johnson noted, he had replied that the \u201conly reason I wouldn\u2019t go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump\u201d.</p> \n<p>That came after other Tories had been openly critical of him. During the urgent question, one Conservative MP, Roger Gale, told the Commons: \u201cThe failure of the former foreign secretary to leap to the defence of Sir Kim shows a lack of leadership that is lamentable.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, was less direct, but made his feelings known, saying the loss of Darroch after Trump\u2019s comments amounted to the UK being bullied.</p> \n<p>Tugendhat said the government should \u201calways stand up for those we send abroad, military or civilian, and will back them to the point that is necessary in the interests of the British people, and no one else\u201d.</p> \n<p>The only support for Johnson in parliament came from the veteran Tory backbencher Peter Bone, who said: \u201cThe attacking of colleagues is completely wrong and people should be ashamed of themselves when they\u2019ve done that.\u201d</p> \n<p>The urgent question was tabled by Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden, who said the decision of Darroch to resign, despite having the full support of Theresa May and her cabinet, was \u201ca dark moment for our democracy and for the standing of the United Kingdom\u201d.</p> \n<p>McFadden said Johnson\u2019s lack of support for the envoy was \u201can appalling abandonment of someone in the firing line\u201d. He added: \u201cReal leaders protect their people, they don\u2019t throw them to the wolves because they can sniff a prize for themselves. His actions are a chilling warning of what is to come if he becomes prime minister.\u201d</p> \n<p>Duncan said he would not be responding to such views on Johnson: \u201cI hope the house will understand if I hold back today from making any further comment on the right honourable friend the member for Uxbridge. I said enough yesterday to make my position entirely clear.\u201d</p> \n<p>Duncan nonetheless managed to reiterate his condemnation of Johnson several times in ways varying from the coded to the open. Responding to one question, he replied: \u201cIt is everyone\u2019s duty, and everyone in this house\u2019s duty, to defend our ambassadors. They are our ambassadors doing our duty. If they do something terribly wrong or break all the rules, that\u2019s altogether different.\u201d</p> \n<p>Duncan later drew laughter after the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Jo Swinson, cited his description of Johnson\u2019s actions as \u201cthe behaviour of an utter wimp\u201d. \u201cI seem to recall that was one of the kinder words I used yesterday,\u201d he told MPs, adding: \u201cI think what I would rather do is concentrate on the specific details of the question put, the merits of Sir Kim Darroch rather than the \u2026 merits of anyone else.\u201d</p> \n<p>Predictions about who will fill the role have already begun, with names mentioned including Sir Mark Sedwill, the head of the civil service.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b0115b8b-d38a-4720-a024-170cb8bcfed3\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Sir Mark Sedwill became Britain\u2019s most powerful civil servant in autumn 2018, after it became clear that predecessor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/04/lord-heywood-of-whitehall-obituary\">Sir Jeremy Heywood</a> was terminally ill.

Many of us voted for Jeremy Corbyn and Tom Watson because we thought their different skills and interests would make a formidable team. Sadly, based on performance to date this has proved to be a deeply flawed judgment. Watson should not be forced out of his party, but clearly he has too much time on his hands. Every week I receive an interesting and lively mailing covering politics, policy and popular culture that does much to promote love and admiration of Tom. I wish he could be managed and supported to turn his energy towards doing the same for the party of which he is currently the deputy leader.<br><strong>Les Bright</strong><br><em>Exeter, Devon</em></p> <p>\u2022 What a depressing article by Dawn Foster. It just won\u2019t do to blame criticism of the supreme leader for the failures that Jeremy Corbyn should own himself. He lost the 2017 election, came fourth in the recent European elections and we should not forget his lamentable performance during the referendum campaign (with voters not knowing where Labour stood) that undoubtedly contributed to the success of the leave campaign. If Corbyn had the guts he would consider his position as to whether he is the right person to lead the Labour party at this momentous time, as defeat in either a referendum or general election will consign most of the country to years of hardship under rightwing Tory rule.<br><strong>Aviva Le Prevost</strong><br><em>Groombridge, East Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 So the only place Dawn Foster meets people with so-called centrist views is in TV studios? Really? Well I meet them every single day as my social circle consists largely of lifelong Labour supporters like me who will never again vote Labour under its current leadership because of its spectacular betrayal of its own tribe during the biggest political crisis of the last 70 years. Foster\u2019s prediction that Labour\u2019s internal schism could hand the likely general election to the Tories is tragically correct, but the blame for that catastrophe will lie at Corbyn\u2019s door and nobody else\u2019s. Corbyn and his extremist acolytes are not waving but drowning and they are pulling the whole of progressive Britain down with them. For many millions of us, the sensible voices of Tom Watson and his like are the only lifeline of hope we have left.<br><strong>Alan Clark</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Dawn Foster\u2019s attack on the \u201ccentrism\u201d of the Labour party, in the shape of Tom Watson, Ed Miliband and in particular Tony Blair, as being \u201cresponsible for the long-term problems\u201d of the British economy is not borne out by the facts. The approach of a government that, over the 13 years after 1997, brought peace to Northern Ireland, dramatically reduced poverty and unemployment, and indeed through its aid policies reduced poverty in the developing world as well, cannot be described as divisive and can still provide inspiration for a divided country.<br><strong>Paul Mosley</strong><br><em>Sheffield</em></p> <p>\u2022 Matthew d\u2019Ancona (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/08/labour-centre-ground-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">The centre is Labour\u2019s for the taking, but it isn\u2019t interested</a>, Journal, 8 July) is wrong to suggest that the purpose of the Labour party should \u201cbe to construct a pretty decent cabinet \u2026 with a fighting chance of uniting the country and governing it competently\u201d.</p> <p>At some point in the 1990s the Labour party was hijacked by just such a group. Enter Tony Blair and corporate friends resulting in an ever increasing acceleration of social inequality that started in 1979 with the election of Margaret Thatcher and continued under Cameron and May. What Labour party members wanted when they elected Jeremy Corbyn in overwhelming numbers was societal change. An end to \u201cgreed is good\u201d and \u201cdevil take the hindmost\u201d: the creation of something truly different from the divided, atomised society of today.</p> <p>While Yvette Cooper and Stella Creasy may be talented politicians, they both stood on \u201cmore of the same\u201d politics in the Labour leadership and deputy leadership elections.

      "bodyText": "In challenging Tom Watson to leave the Labour party, Dawn Foster ventilates a widely held frustration \u2013 that members of the PLP find it easier to attack their own leadership than this useless government (If Tom Watson had guts he\u2019d quit Labour, Journal, 9 July). Many of us voted for Jeremy Corbyn and Tom Watson because we thought their different skills and interests would make a formidable team. Sadly, based on performance to date this has proved to be a deeply flawed judgment. Watson should not be forced out of his party, but clearly he has too much time on his hands. Every week I receive an interesting and lively mailing covering politics, policy and popular culture that does much to promote love and admiration of Tom. I wish he could be managed and supported to turn his energy towards doing the same for the party of which he is currently the deputy leader. Les Bright Exeter, Devon \u2022 What a depressing article by Dawn Foster. It just won\u2019t do to blame criticism of the supreme leader for the failures that Jeremy Corbyn should own himself. He lost the 2017 election, came fourth in the recent European elections and we should not forget his lamentable performance during the referendum campaign (with voters not knowing where Labour stood) that undoubtedly contributed to the success of the leave campaign. If Corbyn had the guts he would consider his position as to whether he is the right person to lead the Labour party at this momentous time, as defeat in either a referendum or general election will consign most of the country to years of hardship under rightwing Tory rule. Aviva Le Prevost Groombridge, East Sussex \u2022 So the only place Dawn Foster meets people with so-called centrist views is in TV studios? Really? Well I meet them every single day as my social circle consists largely of lifelong Labour supporters like me who will never again vote Labour under its current leadership because of its spectacular betrayal of its own tribe during the biggest political crisis of the last 70 years. Foster\u2019s prediction that Labour\u2019s internal schism could hand the likely general election to the Tories is tragically correct, but the blame for that catastrophe will lie at Corbyn\u2019s door and nobody else\u2019s. Corbyn and his extremist acolytes are not waving but drowning and they are pulling the whole of progressive Britain down with them. For many millions of us, the sensible voices of Tom Watson and his like are the only lifeline of hope we have left. Alan Clark London \u2022 Dawn Foster\u2019s attack on the \u201ccentrism\u201d of the Labour party, in the shape of Tom Watson, Ed Miliband and in particular Tony Blair, as being \u201cresponsible for the long-term problems\u201d of the British economy is not borne out by the facts. The approach of a government that, over the 13 years after 1997, brought peace to Northern Ireland, dramatically reduced poverty and unemployment, and indeed through its aid policies reduced poverty in the developing world as well, cannot be described as divisive and can still provide inspiration for a divided country. Paul Mosley Sheffield \u2022 Matthew d\u2019Ancona (The centre is Labour\u2019s for the taking, but it isn\u2019t interested, Journal, 8 July) is wrong to suggest that the purpose of the Labour party should \u201cbe to construct a pretty decent cabinet \u2026 with a fighting chance of uniting the country and governing it competently\u201d. At some point in the 1990s the Labour party was hijacked by just such a group. Enter Tony Blair and corporate friends resulting in an ever increasing acceleration of social inequality that started in 1979 with the election of Margaret Thatcher and continued under Cameron and May. What Labour party members wanted when they elected Jeremy Corbyn in overwhelming numbers was societal change. An end to \u201cgreed is good\u201d and \u201cdevil take the hindmost\u201d: the creation of something truly different from the divided, atomised society of today. While Yvette Cooper and Stella Creasy may be talented politicians, they both stood on \u201cmore of the same\u201d politics in the Labour leadership and deputy leadership elections. That\u2019s not what members wanted and it\u2019s now our party again. Yes, societal change is a big ask, but it\u2019s better to try and fail than never to try at all.

It lies in the theories of creative disruption espoused by the postwar economist Joseph Schumpeter and his followers. To them, occasional bouts of chaos are necessary. As during wars, recessions and Thatcherism, Britain needs a therapeutic shock to jolt it into a new karma, a new inner greatness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cc47f1cf8c4a54602c0de87f14f1dd8eaf741a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cc47f1cf8c4a54602c0de87f14f1dd8eaf741a3/0_67_5251_3151/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstration against a hard border in Newry, Northern Ireland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018No one seems to have a clue how the Northern Ireland border will operate.

UK manufacturers have become slaves to Euro-conglomerates, forced to import bits of cars and planes because they can no longer fashion their own. They should get real. Likewise, it is humiliating that Britain should have Bulgarians picking its fruit, Poles building its houses, Portuguese staffing its clinics and care homes. Of course no deal will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/04/autumn-2020-no-deal-britain-conservative-party\" title=\"\">painful in the short-term</a>, but the short-term is for economic snowflakes.</p> <p>This vision of no deal accepts that it will take years to fashion \u201ctrade deals with the rest of the world\u201d, but self-sufficiency is not built on deals. A no-deal Brexit might be a self-imposed economic sanction, but sanctions can strengthen siege economies. They enforce downsizing, and slash regulation and bureaucracy. They encourage import substitution behind a plummeting exchange rate. Schumpeter posited just such a \u201cgale of creative destruction \u2026 a process of industrial mutation that revolutionises the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one.\u201d That is no-deal Brexit to a T.</p> <p>Schumpeter\u2019s explicit inspiration was Marx, who wrote of \u201cthe violent destruction of capital not by relations external to it, but rather as a condition of its self-preservation\u201d. Though no Marxist, he was much attracted to Marx\u2019s thesis that capitalism <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch15.htm\" title=\"\">required</a> \u201cexplosions, cataclysms, crises, in which \u2026 suspension of labour and annihilation of a great portion of capital \u2026 violently lead it back to the point where it is enabled [to go on] fully employing its productive powers without committing suicide.\u201d To Marx, capitalist disruption was a gateway to socialism, but Schumpeter saw it as cleansing, purifying through pain.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s supporters may be right in seeing ossification in the <a href=\"https://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Business_economics/Oligopoly.html\" title=\"\">oligopolistic economics</a> of the EU. Capitalism needs constantly updating and refreshing \u2013 which is why many believe that Britain should stay and offer Europe its leadership in this endeavour. But creative destruction is a bizarre turn-up for British Conservatism, with its traditional caution and respect for established institutions and interest groups. It is a measure of this ideological revolution that it was Hunt, not Johnson, who said the sacrifice of export-reliant businesses was a price worth paying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/30/jeremy-hunt-i-would-tell-bust-businesses-no-deal-brexit-was-worth-it\" title=\"\">\u201cwith a heavy heart\u201d</a> for a no-deal Brexit. Hunt was a Tory traditionalist, panicking and capitulating to modern populist politics. Johnson\u2019s heart was nowhere to be seen.</p> <p>As Thatcher showed, even creative destruction demands crisis management. Johnson\u2019s politics seem more in tune with the wilder shores of chaos theory. In one gaffe after another, he has been the butterfly whose wing-beat can effect an unpredictable storm. While the chaotic forces of no deal whirl ever faster, his bland shrug of the shoulder becomes the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor\" title=\"\">\u201cstrange attractor\u201d</a> around which they mysteriously cohere.

Preparations for no deal outlined by the BBC and the Institute for Government have examined scenarios varying from extreme disruption to genuine chaos: chaos at the ports, chaos in food and medicine distribution, chaos in care staff recruitment and chaos as financial markets shift to the EU. No one seems to have a clue how the Northern Ireland border will operate. Johnson fluffs all questions on the subject, seeking comfort in the bonkers faction of James Dyson and Wetherspoon\u2019s Tim Martin. Yet ask Johnson\u2019s small band of more sophisticated no-dealers, and a different justification begins to emerge. It lies in the theories of creative disruption espoused by the postwar economist Joseph Schumpeter and his followers. To them, occasional bouts of chaos are necessary. As during wars, recessions and Thatcherism, Britain needs a therapeutic shock to jolt it into a new karma, a new inner greatness. To these no-dealers, sheep farmers and fishermen are the lackeys of Euro-protectionism. UK manufacturers have become slaves to Euro-conglomerates, forced to import bits of cars and planes because they can no longer fashion their own. They should get real. Likewise, it is humiliating that Britain should have Bulgarians picking its fruit, Poles building its houses, Portuguese staffing its clinics and care homes. Of course no deal will be painful in the short-term, but the short-term is for economic snowflakes. This vision of no deal accepts that it will take years to fashion \u201ctrade deals with the rest of the world\u201d, but self-sufficiency is not built on deals. A no-deal Brexit might be a self-imposed economic sanction, but sanctions can strengthen siege economies. They enforce downsizing, and slash regulation and bureaucracy. They encourage import substitution behind a plummeting exchange rate. Schumpeter posited just such a \u201cgale of creative destruction \u2026 a process of industrial mutation that revolutionises the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one.\u201d That is no-deal Brexit to a T. Schumpeter\u2019s explicit inspiration was Marx, who wrote of \u201cthe violent destruction of capital not by relations external to it, but rather as a condition of its self-preservation\u201d. Though no Marxist, he was much attracted to Marx\u2019s thesis that capitalism required \u201cexplosions, cataclysms, crises, in which \u2026 suspension of labour and annihilation of a great portion of capital \u2026 violently lead it back to the point where it is enabled [to go on] fully employing its productive powers without committing suicide.\u201d To Marx, capitalist disruption was a gateway to socialism, but Schumpeter saw it as cleansing, purifying through pain. Johnson\u2019s supporters may be right in seeing ossification in the oligopolistic economics of the EU. Capitalism needs constantly updating and refreshing \u2013 which is why many believe that Britain should stay and offer Europe its leadership in this endeavour. But creative destruction is a bizarre turn-up for British Conservatism, with its traditional caution and respect for established institutions and interest groups. It is a measure of this ideological revolution that it was Hunt, not Johnson, who said the sacrifice of export-reliant businesses was a price worth paying \u201cwith a heavy heart\u201d for a no-deal Brexit. Hunt was a Tory traditionalist, panicking and capitulating to modern populist politics. Johnson\u2019s heart was nowhere to be seen. As Thatcher showed, even creative destruction demands crisis management. Johnson\u2019s politics seem more in tune with the wilder shores of chaos theory. In one gaffe after another, he has been the butterfly whose wing-beat can effect an unpredictable storm. While the chaotic forces of no deal whirl ever faster, his bland shrug of the shoulder becomes the \u201cstrange attractor\u201d around which they mysteriously cohere. As with Donald Trump, anarchy can mean bad things, good things, absolutely any things. Thus Johnson might last just a few months before a scandal erupts or his party cries enough. A Commons revolt might see a Labour-Lib Dem coalition, even perhaps briefly under Jeremy Corbyn or a \u201ccaretaker\u201d. A sudden referendum might reverse Brexit \u2013 humiliating the Brexiters. There might emerge an Irish customs union, or a Scottish secession. Pain and cost could be enormous, but there could be gains as well as losses. That is the essence of chaos. Nobody knows. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

How can the civil service be expected to do their jobs properly now?

They are profoundly wrong. We do not need a civil service of true believers. We need a civil service able to do its job without fear or favour, and that has become much harder this week.</p> \n   <p>Does the minister share this concern that this attack on the civil service is part of the broader attack on institutions essential to the functioning of our democracy? Judges called enemies of the people. MPs called traitors to their country. Broadcasters vilified as having hidden agendas. Our democracy is under fire and those who value and cherish it must speak up and defend it.

It was the most craven and despicable act of cowardice I have seen from any candidate for public office, let alone from someone running to be prime minister. It sends the worst possible signal to our diplomatic service abroad and it should sent warning signs to the whole country that if we thought the current prime minister was bad when it came to her spineless attitude towards Donald Trump, then things are about to get a whole lot worse.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>McInnes also asked for an assurance that Theresa May would appoint a new ambassador to Washington before her successor takes office. Duncan said Darroch\u2019s replacement wold be appointed in the normal way, but he refused to say when that would be.</p> \n  <p>The urgent question was tabled by Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden who gave a very good mini-speech about how respect for institutions is being undermined.

The constant \u201cdrip, drip\u201d, as more than one contributor put it, eats away at the employee\u2019s self-confidence until they become anxious, exhausted and ill, incapable of performing their job and (often following a period of sickleave) resign or are dismissed. Well over half of the people who contributed to this inquiry described suffering significant mental and/or physical illness as a result of this type of bullying behaviour. Sexual harassment is also a problem, with staff being subject to unwanted sexual advances, often accompanied by touching, sometimes forceful. There is an unacceptable level of sexual \u201cbanter\u201d and unwelcome discussion of intimate sexual details. The majority of contributors described being bullied and harassed by their MP employer. A much smaller number described behaviour of fellow staff members but in some of those cases spoke also of their MP employer failing appropriately to address complaints. Some of the worst offenders are well known as such within the Parliamentary community but, other than the odd \u201cquiet word\u201d from a fellow MP or the relevant Whips office, action has rarely been taken to address their behaviour. In the words of one contributor, there has been a \u201cgeneral disregard for the dignity, wellbeing and employment rights of MPs\u2019 staff\u201d.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d26fe158f0845f89e30aeac\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-11T09:24:09.926Z\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Some staff working for MPs subject to 'unacceptable risk of bullying and harrassment', says report</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/documents/Conduct%20in%20Parliament/GWQC%20Inquiry%20Report%2011%20July%202019_.pdf\">the Gemma White report (pdf)</a> into the bullying of staff working for MPs in the Commons.</p> \n  <p>And here are the conclusions.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Some staff of members of parliament are subject to an unacceptable risk of bullying and harassment, including sexual harassment, at work. Most members of parliament treat their staff with dignity and respect but the problem of bullying and harassment is sufficiently widespread to require an urgent collective response.</p> \n   <p>Recent steps taken by the House of Commons to address bullying and harassment across the parliamentary community do not engage sufficiently with the particular issues faced by members\u2019 staff, who are in a uniquely vulnerable position because they are directly employed by members of parliament. Many describe the idea of complaining about bullying and harassment under the new complaints procedure as \u201ccareer suicide\u201d. They also often have strong party and personal loyalties which constitute significant barriers to complaint. </p> \n   <p>To date, the group of MPs\u2019 staff who would be most likely to bring a complaint under the new Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme, namely former staff of MPs, have been denied the right to do so. This limitation must be removed so that they have the opportunity to hold MPs to account. They must also be permitted to complain about events which took place before June 2017 (the current cut-off date) as recommended by Dame Laura Cox. </p> \n   <p>Since few staff will complain in any event, other methods of tackling workplace bullying and harassment must be employed. Voluntary training is not the answer: only 34 out of 650 MPs and 135 out of 3200 MPs\u2019 staff have attended or booked onto the Valuing Everyone training designed to support the new behaviour code introduced in July 2018.</p> \n   <p>There must be a fundamental shift away from regarding members of parliament as \u201c650 small businesses\u201d with near complete freedom to operate in relation to their staff. Members of parliament must be required to adopt and follow employment practices and procedures which are aligned with those followed in other public sector workplaces.</p> \n   <p>This shift must be supported by a properly resourced and staffed department within the House of Commons. It should develop and implement a coherent and robust approach to members\u2019 employment practice and provide support to members and their staff. Any necessary enforcement mechanisms (such as imposing conditions related to good employment practice on MPs\u2019 entitlement to staffing expenditure) should be considered by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority in conjunction with the new department. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d26fbab8f0845f89e30ae8c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-11T09:05:51.191Z\">10.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>For the record, here is <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/press/labour-party-response-panorama-programme/\">Labour\u2019s official response to the Panorama programme,</a> released last night after it was broadcast.

The Tory party is clearly not a happy ship. But Labour is also extraordinarily divided, and we saw that this morning when the Today programme 8.10 slot was devoted to <strong>Tom Watson</strong>, the deputy leader, launching a whole series of complaints about how the party is dealing with antisemitism under its leader, Jeremy Corbyn.</p> \n  <p>The interview was triggered by the reporting in last night\u2019s hour-long Panorama documentary about Labour and antisemitism. <strong>Jessica Elgot </strong>and<strong> Peter Walker</strong>\u2019s story about the programme is here.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/labour-bosses-accused-of-undermining-fight-against-antisemitism-bbc-panorama\">Labour bosses accused of undermining fight against antisemitism</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>This is a long-running and highly contentious issue not least because allegations of antisemitism are inextricably entwined with two other themes. The first is anti-Israelism. Corbyn and his circle are undoubtedly anti-Israel, and a lot of this debate is really about at what point hostility towards the state of Israel becomes antisemitism. (At some point it certainly feels like antisemitism to Jews.) You could call this anti-Zionism, but that is not a particularly helpful term because Zionism means different things to different people. And the second is anti-Corbynism. There is an undoubted overlap between those in Labour who speak out most against the party\u2019s record on antisemitism and those who are critical of Corbyn generally, but that does not mean their complaints are contrived or insincere. For some, the antisemitism issue helps to explain their anti-Corbynism.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points from Tom Watson\u2019s interview.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Watson strongly criticised his own party for dismissing the former staffers who spoke out in the Panorama programme as \u201cdisaffected\u201d ex-employees with \u201caxes to grind\u201d. </strong>Watson said that claim was \u201cfalse\u201d. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I deplore the statement that was made about those people last night. You couldn\u2019t fail to be saddened and moved by the testimony, particularly of the young members who\u2019d had racist abuse in party meetings and on social media. And there was an array of young and old former members of staff from different wings of the party who I think showed great courage to speak out in the way they did ... To speak out about the party they love must have taken a great act of courage and to dismiss their testimony as in some way flawed I think was wrong.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In a statement issued late yesterday afternoon the Labour press office, which like the rest of the party machinery is under the control of the Corbyn faction in the party, not people like Watson, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It appears these disaffected former officials include those who have always opposed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, worked to actively undermine it, and have both personal and political axes to grind. This throws into doubt their credibility as sources.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Interestingly, the long statement issued by the party press office after the Panorama was broadcast did not repeat this criticism of the interviewees.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Watson complained there was a perception of \u201calmost a permissive culture\u201d towards antisemitism in the party.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In the last four years, since Jeremy and I were elected leader and deputy leader of the party, there is a growing belief that there is a sickness in our party, that this kind of abuse has been in some way allowed. That there\u2019s almost a permissive culture that people can use anti-Jewish, racist language both in our meetings and to each other on social media and we\u2019ve failed to address that properly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Watson called for a rule change to \u201cauto-exclude\u201d party members against whom there was a prima facie case to answer about using antisemitic language or behaviour. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think we need to change the way we investigate these systems.</p> \n   <p>Not casting aspersions on the current people, but I think we need to take these cases away from them and have a full, independent system of investigating cases of anti-Jewish racism that involves representatives from the Jewish community of Britain of standing... </p> \n   <p>I think we need a rule change - and this has been argued by others like Keir Starmer<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jul/10/labour-needs-exclusion-rule-antisemitism-keir-starmer-denial\"> [here]</a> and Gordon Brown - that allows us to auto-exclude from the membership people who have a prima facie case to answer of using antisemitic behaviours and language within our own structures.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> \n  <p><em>9.30am:</em> Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> \n  <p><em>10am: </em>A new report on sexual intimidation and bullying of staff working in the House of Commons is published.</p> \n  <p><em>11am: </em>Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, holds a press conference following the publication of the bank\u2019s financial stability report.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been heavily criticised by fellow Tory MPs over his role in Sir Kim Darroch\u2019s decision to resign as the UK ambassador to Washington, with one backbencher saying the frontrunner in the Conservative leadershipcontest should come to the Commons to apologise. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, has stepped up his criticism of Jeremy Corbyn over antisemitism in the party by backing calls for automatic exclusion of members accused of anti-Jewish racism. More than 30 whistleblowers including current Labour members of staff will submit evidence to the equalities watchdog about antisemitism in the party, the Guardian understands. Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary and one of the leading cabinet opponents of hard Brexit, has publicly ditched her opposition to no deal as senior Tories jostle for position in a Boris Johnson cabinet. The Bank of England has sounded the alarm over the risks to City banks from no-deal Brexit, warning that companies across Europe could be cut off from their lenders overnight. A coroner has concluded that no official support was put in place for a prominent Welsh politician who took his own life four days after being sacked amid allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour towards women. Parliament must adopt a raft of new employment measures to ensure that MPs\u2019 staff are no longer subject to an unacceptable risk of bullying and harassment at work, an official inquiry has concluded. Police leaders have written to the two Conservative leadership candidates to say whichever of them becomes prime minister should make providing more money to police and youth services their first priority. Amber Rudd has announced a review of the benefits system for terminally ill claimants, in a challenge to the next prime minister to listen to demands for reform. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here is a Guardian panel on the BBC Panorama programme, with contributions from Jonathan Freedland, Rachel Shabi, Jon Lansman and Keith Kahn-Harris. From Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary Maybe Jeremy Hunt has seen the ConservativeHome survey (see 2.48pm) and remembered he needs to post his ballot paper ... More than 30 whistleblowers including current Labour members of staff will submit evidence to the equalities watchdog about antisemitism in the party, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary and one of the leading cabinet opponents of hard Brexit, has publicly ditched her opposition to no deal, my colleague Rowena Mason reports. In an interview with ConservativeHome last month Boris Johnson said that anyone who wanted to serve in his cabinet would have to agree to support the UK leaving the EU with no deal on 31 October if necessary. The ConservativeHome website has published another of its regular surveys of Tory members, and it has concluded that Boris Johnson has already won the Tory leadership contest. We won\u2019t know for sure for another 12 days, but in the past these surveys have been a fairly reliable guide to how people vote in internal Tory elections. ConservativeHome is making the claim that Boris Johnson \u201chas won this contest already\u201d on the basis that 71% of respondents say they have already voted. Given that the survey also suggests that Johnson is beating Jeremy Hunt by 72% to 28%, that would mean, assuming those figures were correct, that if every new vote being cast from today were to go to Hunt, he still would not be able to catch up. A YouGov poll of Conservative members last week also gave Johnson an enormous lead over Hunt, only its was slightly bigger. In the Commons earlier Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons, said Labour would support moves by John Major to take Boris Johnson to court if Johnson were to become PM and to prorogue parliament to try to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit. During the business statement she quoted approvingly the Tory MP Dominic Grieve saying proroguing parliament in this way would be \u201cthe end of parliamentary democracy\u201d. Mel Stride, the leader of the Commons, played down the prospect of this happening. He replied: The government doesn\u2019t believe that [proroguing parliament] would be a desirable situation, not least it would put the monarch in an awkward position being involved in what is essentially a political decision given that it is prorogation based upon the advice of the pime minister but ultimately for the Queen to grant that. I would also say, as I think Mr Speaker you have suggested, that it seems inconceivable that parliament will not have its opportunity to ensure that it has appropriate time to debate at the appropriate time these very, very important matters for our country. These are from Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and Tory leadership contender. In an interview for today\u2019s Sun Boris Johnson rejected suggestions that he contributed to Sir Kim Darroch\u2019s decision to resign by not backing him in the ITV debate on Tuesday. Johnson told the paper: I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re trying to blame me for this. It seems bizarre to me. I\u2019m a great supporter of Kim\u2019s. I worked very well with him for years. I spoke to him just now to offer my good wishes. I think that he\u2019s done a superb job. I\u2019d be very surprised that\u2019s the construction placed on events. In an interview for Politico Europe\u2019s London Playbook Johnson also rejected claims that he undermined Darroch in the debate on Tuesday night. Commenting on his refusal to say that he would definitely keep Darroch in office if he became prime minister, Johnson said it would be \u201ctotally, totally wrong to drag the career prospects of a civil servant into a political debate\u201d. But he also cracked a joke about Darroch\u2019s plight. Here is the key paragraph from Jack Blanchard\u2019s interview. Why did he not voice more support for Kim Darroch in Tuesday night\u2019s TV debate? \u201cNo, I did,\u201d Johnson protests. \u201cI said I believe very strongly that civil servants should not have their views leaked.\u201d But you didn\u2019t say you\u2019d keep him in his job, I tell him. \u201cNo, but I think it\u2019s totally, totally wrong to drag the career prospects of a civil servant into a political debate,\u201d Johnson says. But maybe people want to see a leader sticking up for their own side? \u201cI made it very clear that under no circumstances would anybody else take a decision about who is going to represent the U.K. I was absolutely categorical about that. And for the record I am a long-standing admirer of Kim Darroch. And I say furthermore that if Donald Trump can make friends with Kim Jong Un, then he can make friends with Kim Dar-roch.\u201d Although there were various factors behind Darroch\u2019s decision to resign, as the Guardian reports the ambassador took the final decision after watching Johnson on Tuesday night repeatedly refusing to say he wanted him to stay. Towards the end of the urgent question on Kim Darroch the Conservative MP David Morris said Boris Johnson should apologise for not supporting Darroch in the ITV debate on Tuesday. He said: It is incumbent on every member of parliament in this place to back up our excellent diplomats and civil servants and [Johnson] should come to the house and apologise. Here are extracts from the mini speech that the Labour MP Pat McFadden gave as he asked his urgent question about the resignation of Sir Kim Darroch. The resignation of Sir Kim Darroch marks a dark moment for our democracy and for the standing of the United Kingdom. McFadden said Darroch was hugely respected, and was just doing his job. He praised Darroch for the \u201cprofessionalism\u201d of his response to this affair. He went on: The response of [Boris Johnson] was an appalling abandonment of someone in the firing line. Real leaders protect their people. They don\u2019t throw them to the wolves because they can sniff a prize for themselves. His actions were a chilling warning of what is to come if he becomes prime minister. How can the civil service be expected to do their jobs properly now? How can they operate if they fear leaks followed by abandonment by our political leaders? Then he went on to make a wider point. Those who welcome Kim Darroch\u2019s departure believe that we need a civil service of true believers. They are profoundly wrong. We do not need a civil service of true believers. We need a civil service able to do its job without fear or favour, and that has become much harder this week. Does the minister share this concern that this attack on the civil service is part of the broader attack on institutions essential to the functioning of our democracy? Judges called enemies of the people. MPs called traitors to their country. Broadcasters vilified as having hidden agendas. Our democracy is under fire and those who value and cherish it must speak up and defend it. Whipping up anger against one institution after another, and dressing it up as an attack on the establishment, is doing profound harm to the country and we must call it out for the insidious agenda that it is. Responding, Sir Alan Duncan, the Foreign Office minister, praised McFadden for his wisdom and said his words should be \u201cpinned on every wall\u201d as an instruction to people how to act. And here are some tweets from notable Labour figures and organisations critical of the Panorama programme about antisemitism in the party. From Barry Sheerman MP From Claudia Webbe, a member of Labour\u2019s national executive committee From my colleague Owen Jones From Steve Howell, a former deputy communications chief for Jeremy Corbyn From Jewish Voice for Labour, a relatively small pro-Corbyn group, not to be confused with the Jewish Labour Movement, which issued a statement last night saying the programme showed the party was \u201cinstitutionally racist against Jews\u201d. In the Commons Sir Alan Duncan, the Foreign Office minister, is responding to an urgent question about the resignation of Sir Kim Darroch. The Tory MP Roger Gale has just said that Boris Johnson\u2019s failure to defend Darroch in the ITV Tory leadership debate on Tuesday was \u201clamentable\u201d. In response, Duncan said he did not want to say any more about Johnson today, because he made his position clear yesterday. This caused some amusement, because yesterday Duncan did not exactly hold back. He said that Johnson had thrown Darroch under the bus and that Johnson was guilty of \u201ccontemptible negligence\u201d. Speaking for Labour, Liz McInnes, the shadow Foreign Office minister also launched a strong attack on Johnson. She identified many people she said were at fault, but she went on: But the biggest villain of all is the man about to become our next prime minister. He had the chance on Tuesday night, not just once, but six times, to defend Sir Kim and oppose Donald Trump. But he took an active choice instead to throw our man in Washington under the bus. It was the most craven and despicable act of cowardice I have seen from any candidate for public office, let alone from someone running to be prime minister. It sends the worst possible signal to our diplomatic service abroad and it should sent warning signs to the whole country that if we thought the current prime minister was bad when it came to her spineless attitude towards Donald Trump, then things are about to get a whole lot worse. McInnes also asked for an assurance that Theresa May would appoint a new ambassador to Washington before her successor takes office. Duncan said Darroch\u2019s replacement wold be appointed in the normal way, but he refused to say when that would be. The urgent question was tabled by Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden who gave a very good mini-speech about how respect for institutions is being undermined. I will post the quotes soon. Here is some reaction to the Panorama documentary from Labour MPs and other senior figures in the party. These are all tweets from people alarmed by the programmes revelations. Separately I will post a round-up of tweets critical of the programme, although I have seen far fewer of those from MPs and senior people in the party.

By far the most common form of offending behaviour described to me was of MPs who shout at, demean, belittle and humiliate their staff on a regular basis, often in public. The constant \u201cdrip, drip\u201d, as more than one contributor put it, eats away at the employee\u2019s self-confidence until they become anxious, exhausted and ill, incapable of performing their job and (often following a period of sickleave) resign or are dismissed. Well over half of the people who contributed to this inquiry described suffering significant mental and/or physical illness as a result of this type of bullying behaviour. Sexual harassment is also a problem, with staff being subject to unwanted sexual advances, often accompanied by touching, sometimes forceful. There is an unacceptable level of sexual \u201cbanter\u201d and unwelcome discussion of intimate sexual details. The majority of contributors described being bullied and harassed by their MP employer. A much smaller number described behaviour of fellow staff members but in some of those cases spoke also of their MP employer failing appropriately to address complaints. Some of the worst offenders are well known as such within the Parliamentary community but, other than the odd \u201cquiet word\u201d from a fellow MP or the relevant Whips office, action has rarely been taken to address their behaviour. In the words of one contributor, there has been a \u201cgeneral disregard for the dignity, wellbeing and employment rights of MPs\u2019 staff\u201d. Here is the Gemma White report (pdf) into the bullying of staff working for MPs in the Commons. And here are the conclusions. Some staff of members of parliament are subject to an unacceptable risk of bullying and harassment, including sexual harassment, at work. Most members of parliament treat their staff with dignity and respect but the problem of bullying and harassment is sufficiently widespread to require an urgent collective response. Recent steps taken by the House of Commons to address bullying and harassment across the parliamentary community do not engage sufficiently with the particular issues faced by members\u2019 staff, who are in a uniquely vulnerable position because they are directly employed by members of parliament. Many describe the idea of complaining about bullying and harassment under the new complaints procedure as \u201ccareer suicide\u201d. They also often have strong party and personal loyalties which constitute significant barriers to complaint. To date, the group of MPs\u2019 staff who would be most likely to bring a complaint under the new Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme, namely former staff of MPs, have been denied the right to do so. This limitation must be removed so that they have the opportunity to hold MPs to account. They must also be permitted to complain about events which took place before June 2017 (the current cut-off date) as recommended by Dame Laura Cox. Since few staff will complain in any event, other methods of tackling workplace bullying and harassment must be employed. Voluntary training is not the answer: only 34 out of 650 MPs and 135 out of 3200 MPs\u2019 staff have attended or booked onto the Valuing Everyone training designed to support the new behaviour code introduced in July 2018. There must be a fundamental shift away from regarding members of parliament as \u201c650 small businesses\u201d with near complete freedom to operate in relation to their staff. Members of parliament must be required to adopt and follow employment practices and procedures which are aligned with those followed in other public sector workplaces. This shift must be supported by a properly resourced and staffed department within the House of Commons. It should develop and implement a coherent and robust approach to members\u2019 employment practice and provide support to members and their staff. Any necessary enforcement mechanisms (such as imposing conditions related to good employment practice on MPs\u2019 entitlement to staffing expenditure) should be considered by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority in conjunction with the new department. For the record, here is Labour\u2019s official response to the Panorama programme, released last night after it was broadcast. Here\u2019s an extract. We completely reject any claim that Labour is antisemitic. We stand in solidarity with Jewish people, and we\u2019re taking decisive action to root out antisemitism from our movement and society. The Panorama programme was not a fair or balanced investigation. It was a seriously inaccurate, politically one-sided polemic, which breached basic journalistic standards, invented quotes and edited emails to change their meaning. It was an overtly biased intervention by the BBC in party political controversy. Here is the statement that the UK\u2019s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, issued after last night\u2019s Panorama programme about antisemitism in the Labour party. \u201cThis is no longer a question of the leadership\u2019s inability to deal with the scourge of antisemitism, but of its direct complicity in it,\u201d he says. In his Today interview Tom Watson also said that he thought Jeremy Corbyn was the \u201conly one\u201d who could fix the antisemitism issue in Labour. Asked if he thought Corbyn could fix this problem, Watson replied: Not only do I think [Corbyn] can fix it, I think he is the only one who can fix it. And if he adopts some of the proposals that I\u2019m making [see 9.27am] then these rule changes will go through our party. It won\u2019t be enough to rebuild trust with the Jewish community but it will be a start of trying to challenge a culture of permissiveness that allows anti-Jewish racism to be casually used in political discussion within one of the two great parties in the United Kingdom. We have got an urgent question in the Commons on the resignation of Kim Darroch at 10.30am. Yesterday we started the morning with a former Conservative party leader and prime minister, Sir John Major, saying that he could take legal action against the man likely to be the next party leader and PM, Boris Johnson, over proroguing parliament. The Tory party is clearly not a happy ship. But Labour is also extraordinarily divided, and we saw that this morning when the Today programme 8.10 slot was devoted to Tom Watson, the deputy leader, launching a whole series of complaints about how the party is dealing with antisemitism under its leader, Jeremy Corbyn. The interview was triggered by the reporting in last night\u2019s hour-long Panorama documentary about Labour and antisemitism. Jessica Elgot and Peter Walker\u2019s story about the programme is here. This is a long-running and highly contentious issue not least because allegations of antisemitism are inextricably entwined with two other themes. The first is anti-Israelism. Corbyn and his circle are undoubtedly anti-Israel, and a lot of this debate is really about at what point hostility towards the state of Israel becomes antisemitism. (At some point it certainly feels like antisemitism to Jews.) You could call this anti-Zionism, but that is not a particularly helpful term because Zionism means different things to different people. And the second is anti-Corbynism. There is an undoubted overlap between those in Labour who speak out most against the party\u2019s record on antisemitism and those who are critical of Corbyn generally, but that does not mean their complaints are contrived or insincere. For some, the antisemitism issue helps to explain their anti-Corbynism. Here are the main points from Tom Watson\u2019s interview. Watson strongly criticised his own party for dismissing the former staffers who spoke out in the Panorama programme as \u201cdisaffected\u201d ex-employees with \u201caxes to grind\u201d. Watson said that claim was \u201cfalse\u201d. He went on: I deplore the statement that was made about those people last night. You couldn\u2019t fail to be saddened and moved by the testimony, particularly of the young members who\u2019d had racist abuse in party meetings and on social media. And there was an array of young and old former members of staff from different wings of the party who I think showed great courage to speak out in the way they did ... To speak out about the party they love must have taken a great act of courage and to dismiss their testimony as in some way flawed I think was wrong. In a statement issued late yesterday afternoon the Labour press office, which like the rest of the party machinery is under the control of the Corbyn faction in the party, not people like Watson, said: It appears these disaffected former officials include those who have always opposed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, worked to actively undermine it, and have both personal and political axes to grind. This throws into doubt their credibility as sources. Interestingly, the long statement issued by the party press office after the Panorama was broadcast did not repeat this criticism of the interviewees. Watson complained there was a perception of \u201calmost a permissive culture\u201d towards antisemitism in the party. He said: In the last four years, since Jeremy and I were elected leader and deputy leader of the party, there is a growing belief that there is a sickness in our party, that this kind of abuse has been in some way allowed. That there\u2019s almost a permissive culture that people can use anti-Jewish, racist language both in our meetings and to each other on social media and we\u2019ve failed to address that properly. Watson called for a rule change to \u201cauto-exclude\u201d party members against whom there was a prima facie case to answer about using antisemitic language or behaviour. He said: I think we need to change the way we investigate these systems. Not casting aspersions on the current people, but I think we need to take these cases away from them and have a full, independent system of investigating cases of anti-Jewish racism that involves representatives from the Jewish community of Britain of standing... I think we need a rule change - and this has been argued by others like Keir Starmer [here] and Gordon Brown - that allows us to auto-exclude from the membership people who have a prima facie case to answer of using antisemitic behaviours and language within our own structures. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 10am: A new report on sexual intimidation and bullying of staff working in the House of Commons is published. 11am: Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, holds a press conference following the publication of the bank\u2019s financial stability report. My colleague Graeme Wearden will be covering it on his business live blog. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary at lunchtime and then another when I finish. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",
