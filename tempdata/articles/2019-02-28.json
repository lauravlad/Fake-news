The immigration bill will extend the hostile environment to European migrants, putting them into the same system that brought us the Windrush scandal. The income thresholds introduced by the bill will separate families and exclude many millions of people who might otherwise have contributed to our society. We reject utterly the lie that immigration is to blame for the state of public services or falling wages. These are the result of austerity, privatisation and deregulation. Ending free movement will do nothing to end these damaging policies, and will put migrant workers at the mercy of their employers. We need solidarity, not scapegoating. On 1 March, we will be joining a day of action against the bill, with communities making their voice heard up and down the country.

They were all hardline Brexiters, but they were small in number, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/feb/27/brexit-debate-latest-news-developments-pmqs-chair-jacob-rees-mogg-drops-his-calls-for-wholesale-removal-of-backstop-politics-live?page=with:block-5c76ea18e4b0822aecfce45c#block-5c76ea18e4b0822aecfce45c\">they lost the vote by a majority of almost 500.</a> The rebellion seemed contained.</p> <p>But <strong>George Eustice</strong>\u2019s resignation shows that it is not just the Brexiter ultras who are furious about the prospect of article 50 being extended. He is one of the Brexiter pragmatists - in his letter he says that he accepts the need for compromise, and will vote for Theresa May\u2019s deal - but felt strongly enough about this to leave government.</p> <p>Here are some of the main points from his letter. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/feb/28/brexit-latest-news-developments-mcdonnell-says-theres-chance-labour-could-win-vote-for-second-referendum-politics-live?page=with:block-5c77f405e4b0c5f21366480a#block-5c77f405e4b0c5f21366480a\"> 2.47pm.)</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Eustice claims that allowing article 50 to be extended would lead to \u201chumiliation\u201d for the UK because it would allow the EU to dictate terms.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He says that the UK must be willing to leave the EU with no deal in order to get the best outcome</strong>. However, he does not explain in detail exactly how he expects the EU would react to this brinkmanship, or what concessions he thinks they might offer.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He claims that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the EU would offer the UK an informal nine-month transition.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We must be ready to face down the European Union here and now. The absence of an agreement poses risks and costs for them too. We already know that in the event of \u201cno deal\u201d the EU will seek an informal transition period for nine months in many areas and settlement talks could continue within this window.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is significant because it reflects a relatively common view amongst Brexiters. But this is not what the EU are saying would happen in the event of no deal. Towards the end of last year, when giving <a href=\"http://www.sipotra.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Oral-evidence-The-progress-of-the-UK%E2%80%99s-negotiations-on-EU-withdrawal-HC-372.pdf\">evidence to the Commons Brexit committee (pdf),<strong> <br></strong></a><strong>Michel Barnier,</strong> the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiators, was asked if there would be informal UK-EU deals in the event of there being no agreement. He replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now if there is a no deal there is no more discussion. There is no more negotiation. It is over and each side will take its own unilateral contingency measures, and we will take them in such areas as aviation, but this does not mean mini-deals in the case of a no deal. We want a deal. We want an overall agreement; otherwise each will take their own contingency measures on their own side. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Eustice claims that parliament is now \u201cin direct control of events\u201d. </strong>This is questionable, because the amendment that would have forced the government to cede control of the parliamentary timetable to allow the Yvette Cooper bill to be debated was never voted on or passed. But Eustice clearly feels that, even though the original Cooper plan was not implemented, it might just as well have been.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He says that he is resigning because he wants to be \u201cfree to participate in the critical debate\u201d coming up. </strong>That implies that he wants to be able to vote against extending article 50 if there is a vote on 14 March (following the defeat of the Brexit deal). That in turn implies that he expects May to whip Tory MPs to vote for extension in those circumstances - something ministers have refused to confirm.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He accuses the EU of not acting honourably. </strong>He says:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I do not believe that the commission has behaved honourably during these negotiations. They have deliberately made progress slow and difficult. They have stated in terms that they will refuse to even hold substantive negotiations on a future partnership until after we leave. If the position of parliament is now that we will refuse to leave without an agreement then we are somewhat stuck. This is uncomfortable for everyone, but we cannot negotiate a successful Brexit unless we are prepared to walk through the door.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-28T15:53:42.563Z\">at 3.53pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c77f7fee4b0c5f213664858\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-28T15:02:56.854Z\">3.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from the BBC\u2019s <strong>Laura Kuenssberg </strong>on George Eustice\u2019s resignation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1101134854392082435\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hearing \u2018swelling unhappiness\u2019 among some ministers over what happened last night <a href=\"https://t.co/R3wP8SB4NH\">https://t.co/R3wP8SB4NH</a></p>&mdash; Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1101134854392082435?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 28, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c77f4c6e4b0c5f213664813\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-28T14:52:27.470Z\">2.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>To make sense of George Eustice\u2019s resignation, it helps to know that, although he is not the most vocal of the Brexiters in government, he is probably the only one who once stood as a Ukip candidate.

Here is his resignation letter in full.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is with tremendous sadness that I have decided to resign from the government following the decision this week to allow the postponement of our exit from the EU. Since parliament is now in direct control of events, I want to be free to participate in the critical debate that will take place in the weeks ahead.</p> <p>It has been an honour to work alongside so many talented individuals at Defra over the past five years. Defra has phenomenal expertise and, more than any other government department, has embraced the opportunities posed by our exit from the EU. I have particularly welcomed the chance to craft two new Bills on farming and fisheries, which are the first for half a century, as we have prepared the ground to restore self-government in this country.</p> <p>I will vote for your withdrawal agreement when it returns to the House and I very much hope that the attorney general succeeds in securing final changes so that others might too. Although I campaigned to leave, I have always supported compromise to achieve a reconciliation in our country. Leaving the EU would represent an historic change and it is natural that some people will feel apprehensive. I have been open to the idea of using our existing membership of the EEA as an exit mechanism and I supported your approach outlined at Chequers when others did not. I have stuck with the government through a series of rather undignified retreats. However, I fear that developments this week will lead to a sequence of events culminating in the EU dictating the terms of any extension requested and the final humiliation of our country.</p> <p>I appreciate that you have been terribly undermined by those in parliament who refuse to respect the referendum result. You have shown tenacity and resilience over the past year. However, what our country needs from all its political leaders at this critical juncture is courage, and we are about to find out whether parliament has it.</p> <p>As a Defra Minister, I have enjoyed good relations with the European commission and with ministers from other member states. However, I do not believe that the commission has behaved honourably during these negotiations. They have deliberately made progress slow and difficult. They have stated in terms that they will refuse to even hold substantive negotiations on a future partnership until after we leave. If the position of Parliament is now that we will refuse to leave without an agreement then we are somewhat stuck. This is uncomfortable for everyone, but we cannot negotiate a successful Brexit unless we are prepared to walk through the door.</p> <p>We must therefore have the courage, if necessary, to reclaim our freedom first and talk afterwards. We must be ready to face down the European Union here and now. The absence of an agreement poses risks and costs for them too. We already know that in the event of \u201cno deal\u201d the EU will seek an informal transition period for nine months in many areas and settlement talks could continue within this window.</p> <p>I will do what I can from the back benches to try to salvage this sorry situation and I hope that, when the moment comes, Parliament will not let our country down.</p> </blockquote> <h2><br></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c77f2e8e4b09f04c9ee1286\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-28T14:43:51.637Z\">2.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">George Eustice resigns as fisheries minister in protest against May agreeing possible article 50 extension</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>George Eustice,</strong> the Brexiter fisheries minister, has just announced his resignation from the government.

The Tory Brexiter David Jones has just asked him if there is any precedent for cabinet ministers openly arguing against government policy, as is happening now. He was referring to the way three pro-Europeans published <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6736131/MPs-Rudd-Clark-Gauke-appeal-Tory-unity-party-engulfed-bitter-fighting.html\">a Daily Mail article</a> on Saturday saying the government should rule out a no-deal Brexit. Sedwill appeared to concede that this was unprecedented, saying \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an exact parallel\u201d, although he subsequently said similar issues arose at the time of the Iraq war.</p> <p>He also admitted that there was too much leaking from cabinet.

My colleague <strong>Rob Davies</strong> has previewed the speech here.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/28/labour-to-push-for-stricter-online-gambling-regulations\">Labour to push for stricter online gambling regulations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Watson was also asked about wider Labour issues, particularly antisemitism. Here are the main points he made.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Watson said the resignation of Luciana Berger last week was \u201cthe worst day of shame in the Labour Party\u2019s 120-year history\u201d</strong>. He would be meeting Jeremy Corbyn next week to discuss what more could be done to tackle antisemitism in the party. He explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve asked to see Jeremy on Monday next week to talk about how we can further improve our measures to deal with antisemitism. </p> <p>When Luciana Berger left the Labour party, I thought it was the worst day of shame in the Labour party\u2019s 120-year history. A pregnant young MP bullied out of her own party by racist thugs. </p> <p>The one thing I say to my colleagues and half a million Labour party members is that I am not going to allow them to be tainted by racism, so I am going to speak out on antisemitism for as long as it takes to root it out and deal with it. There\u2019s individual responsibility here but there\u2019s also collective responsibility on the shadow cabinet and national executive committee to speak out and deal with it.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He strongly criticised Chris Williamson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/28/labour-to-push-for-stricter-online-gambling-regulations\">who was suspended from the party yesterday,</a> saying some of Williamson\u2019s comments have been \u201calmost ... deliberately inflammatory\u201d. </strong>Watson said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Having monitored some of the things he\u2019s said in the last week, our general secretary decided that the pattern of behaviour over recent months was potentially bringing our party into disrepute, and so has suspended him from the party and there\u2019ll be an inquiry. </p> <p>He\u2019s entitled to a fair hearing but I\u2019ve been very, very concerned that his comments have almost been deliberately inflammatory and causing offence to not just parliamentary colleagues but people in the Jewish community who understandably have a real concern about antisemitism in the Labour party.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he did not know whether or not, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-chris-williamson-antisemitism-labour-mp-video-jewish-abuse-a8800496.html\">as has been claimed</a>, someone from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office argued against Williamson being suspended.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Watson failed to give Corbyn a wholehearted endorsement as a potential prime minister.</strong> When asked if Corbyn was fit to be prime minister, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He could easily be prime minister. </p> <p>But, of course, we could do without the antisemitism because it allows you to ask me that question on the Today programme. We need to close these issues down and we do it by being absolutely vigilant in the way we deal with racism in our own ranks. That\u2019s on all of us.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He confirmed that he wanted to set up a group for Labour MPs from the party\u2019s social democratic wing. </strong>He explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For very understandable reasons in the party - to do with the challenge to Jeremy a couple of years ago and some MPs not wanting to serve - we\u2019ve not got a balance of traditions on our front bench. </p> <p>We can handle that, but it does mean there needs to be a different way of making sure that those traditions\u2019 voices are expressed in a different way on policy-making. </p> <p>There\u2019s no big issue about this but I do want the democratic socialist and the Christian socialist and the social democratic traditions to be heard in the parliamentary Labour party - if not on the front bench, to be heard by the front bench.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e08779675941f77092d0e18ce02f3661e9ac1b96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e08779675941f77092d0e18ce02f3661e9ac1b96/0_14_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Watson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c77ab63e4b01c747a0e578c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-28T09:36:37.202Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the Commons <strong>Nick Brown</strong>, the Labour chief whip, has just moved the writ for the Newport West byelection, caused by the death of Paul Flynn.

And I think the more we focus on that, the more there\u2019s a chance that either a deal will go through that will protect jobs and the economy, or to get some deal through it will be conditional on going back to the people.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>McDonnell also said that, even though his Hayes and Harlington constituency voted leave, he would vote remain in a second referendum, he would campaign for remain if there were a referendum. He explained: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Yes I would [vote remain] because I did last time. I think it\u2019s the right thing to do.

Brussels is to insist that any Brexit delay is a one-off, according to senior EU diplomats, setting the stage for Theresa May to present MPs with the choice of her deal or a chaotic no-deal exit this summer. The British government has expressed anger after the EU offered tentative support for Spain\u2019s territorial claim over the land on which Gibraltar airport is built. NHS bosses have urged ministers to scrap controversial legislation that has led to the widespread privatisation of healthcare as part of a major revamp of the health service. Britain launched an economic and diplomatic push to protect Jordan as an oasis of political stability in the Middle East by staging a conference designed to rescue the debt-ridden country, and help its leader, mainly by an injection of private sector investment. The Labour MP David Lammy has denied snubbing Comic Relief after he became embroiled in a dispute with the television journalist and Strictly Come Dancing winner Stacey Dooley. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. A group of Extinction Rebellion climate activists planning to stage a protest during first minister\u2019s questions were stopped by police from entering the Scottish parliament earlier today. Extinction Rebellion Scotland, an offshoot of the now global network of climate protestors, said they planned to interrupt Nicola Sturgeon by challenging her to pursue much more radical, tougher policies to cut carbon emissions. Activists posing as tourists staged an occupation in the Holyrood chamber on Friday 25 January, a non-sitting day, and also a sit-down protest in Parliament Square outside Westminster. Sturgeon insists her government is amongst the world leaders on tackling climate change, but an Extinction Rebellion spokeswoman said: We were intending to stand up during first minister\u2019s questions, and ask \u2018why won\u2019t the Scottish government commit to going carbon neutral by 2025? We call on the Scottish government to tell the truth and act as if the truth was real. A Police Scotland spokesman said: On the morning of Thursday 27th February, officers working at the Scottish parliament had reason to believe that five individuals attempting to enter the Scottish parliament were intent on disrupting parliamentary business. They were refused entry and left the area with no issue. Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, has welcomed George Eustice\u2019s resignation. He says leaving the EU with no deal \u201cmay yet be the best option for the UK\u201d. Here is the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith on George Eustice\u2019s resignation. Here is Michael Gove, the environment secretary, on the resignation of his junior minister and fellow Brexiter George Eustice. Here is Theresa May\u2019s response to George Eustice\u2019s resignation letter. By the standard of these things, it is warm and complimentary. The Russell Group is calling on Sajid Javid to scrap plans for a 36-month visa for EU nationals coming to the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit because it discriminates against Scottish universities, which offer four year degrees. Describing the plans, which would also penalise future EU students wanting to study engineering or medicine courses, which also last longer than three years, as \u201ca kick in the teeth\u201d for Scottish universities, the Russell Group head of policy Jess Cole said: Introducing a non-extendable, three-year visa for EU nationals would be bizarre. It\u2019s a kick in the teeth to Scottish universities, given nearly every undergraduate course in Scotland is four years, and to courses such as medicine and engineering, which are also longer. This makes no sense for the NHS and industry, given the doctors and engineers we need. Alastair Sim, director of Universities Scotland, said: This policy actively discriminates against Scottish universities as our undergraduate degrees are typically four years in length. This is an oversight by the UK government but one which will inflict disproportionate damage to our institutions and must be rectified as a matter of urgency. It\u2019s not quite the Jarrow March, although it follows a similar route \u2013 next month a group of pro-Brexit protesters , led by Nigel Farage, are due to stage a walk from Sunderland to London to \u201cvoice their deep disappointment at the ongoing betrayal of the referendum result\u201d. The event is being organised by Leave Means Leave, whose founder and chair, Richard Tice and John Longworth, will be among the planned \u201ccore group\u201d of marchers who will trek the entire 270 or so miles. Farage, the former Ukip leader who is setting up a new pro-Brexit party, will be there for the start \u2013 Sunderland was chosen as the first city to record a vote for leave in 2016 \u2013 and on yet-to-be-confirmed other legs to be fitted round his \u201cpre-existing commitments\u201d, a spokesman for Leave Means Leave said. The march will end with a rally in Parliament Square on 29 March, the planned Brexit date, though of course it might end up not being then. In a quote released by the organisers, Farage said: The Westminster elite are in the process of betraying the British people over Brexit. All of us who want Britain to be a great country once again accept that we must be prepared to stand up for what we believe in and fight for our independence. The European commission has rejected the UK parliament\u2019s call for a mini deal guaranteeing citizens\u2019 rights in the event of the withdrawal agreement being rejected. Last night the Commons approved without opposition the amendment tabled by the Tory MP Alberto Costa saying the government should ask the EU \u201cto adopt part two of the withdrawal agreement on citizens\u2019 rights ... whatever the outcome of negotiations on other aspects of the withdrawal agreement.\u201d The government originally opposed the amendment, on the grounds that the EU would never agree, although it changed its mind yesterday hours ahead of the vote. And today we\u2019ve discovered that Theresa May\u2019s initial assessment was right; according to the EU, the Costa plan is a non-starter. This is what the European commission\u2019s spokeswoman Mina Andreeva told a Brussels briefing when asked if the EU was willing to strike a deal of the kind proposed by Costa. She replied: We will not negotiate mini-deals because negotiating such mini-deals outside the withdrawal agreement would imply that the negotiations have failed. Andreeva said that the best way to protect the continuing rights of expat citizens was \u201cthrough the withdrawal agreement\u201d. Last night most Tory MPs voted alongside the opposition to back an amendment approving Theresa May\u2019s decision to allow the Commons a possible vote on extending article 50. Dozens of Conservatives abstained, but only 20 voted against. They were all hardline Brexiters, but they were small in number, and they lost the vote by a majority of almost 500. The rebellion seemed contained. But George Eustice\u2019s resignation shows that it is not just the Brexiter ultras who are furious about the prospect of article 50 being extended. He is one of the Brexiter pragmatists - in his letter he says that he accepts the need for compromise, and will vote for Theresa May\u2019s deal - but felt strongly enough about this to leave government. Here are some of the main points from his letter. (See 2.47pm.) Eustice claims that allowing article 50 to be extended would lead to \u201chumiliation\u201d for the UK because it would allow the EU to dictate terms. He says that the UK must be willing to leave the EU with no deal in order to get the best outcome. However, he does not explain in detail exactly how he expects the EU would react to this brinkmanship, or what concessions he thinks they might offer. He claims that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the EU would offer the UK an informal nine-month transition. We must be ready to face down the European Union here and now. The absence of an agreement poses risks and costs for them too. We already know that in the event of \u201cno deal\u201d the EU will seek an informal transition period for nine months in many areas and settlement talks could continue within this window. This is significant because it reflects a relatively common view amongst Brexiters. But this is not what the EU are saying would happen in the event of no deal. Towards the end of last year, when giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee (pdf), Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiators, was asked if there would be informal UK-EU deals in the event of there being no agreement. He replied: Now if there is a no deal there is no more discussion. There is no more negotiation. It is over and each side will take its own unilateral contingency measures, and we will take them in such areas as aviation, but this does not mean mini-deals in the case of a no deal. We want a deal. We want an overall agreement; otherwise each will take their own contingency measures on their own side. Eustice claims that parliament is now \u201cin direct control of events\u201d. This is questionable, because the amendment that would have forced the government to cede control of the parliamentary timetable to allow the Yvette Cooper bill to be debated was never voted on or passed. But Eustice clearly feels that, even though the original Cooper plan was not implemented, it might just as well have been. He says that he is resigning because he wants to be \u201cfree to participate in the critical debate\u201d coming up. That implies that he wants to be able to vote against extending article 50 if there is a vote on 14 March (following the defeat of the Brexit deal). That in turn implies that he expects May to whip Tory MPs to vote for extension in those circumstances - something ministers have refused to confirm. He accuses the EU of not acting honourably. He says: I do not believe that the commission has behaved honourably during these negotiations. They have deliberately made progress slow and difficult. They have stated in terms that they will refuse to even hold substantive negotiations on a future partnership until after we leave. If the position of parliament is now that we will refuse to leave without an agreement then we are somewhat stuck. This is uncomfortable for everyone, but we cannot negotiate a successful Brexit unless we are prepared to walk through the door. This is from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg on George Eustice\u2019s resignation. To make sense of George Eustice\u2019s resignation, it helps to know that, although he is not the most vocal of the Brexiters in government, he is probably the only one who once stood as a Ukip candidate. That was back in 1999, when he failed to get elected as an MP. He subsequently joined the Conservatives, working for David Cameron as his press secretary when Cameron was opposition leader, before being elected MP for Camborne and Redruth in Cornwall in 2010. Here is the full text of George Eustice\u2019s resignation letter. Here is his resignation letter in full. It is with tremendous sadness that I have decided to resign from the government following the decision this week to allow the postponement of our exit from the EU. Since parliament is now in direct control of events, I want to be free to participate in the critical debate that will take place in the weeks ahead. It has been an honour to work alongside so many talented individuals at Defra over the past five years. Defra has phenomenal expertise and, more than any other government department, has embraced the opportunities posed by our exit from the EU. I have particularly welcomed the chance to craft two new Bills on farming and fisheries, which are the first for half a century, as we have prepared the ground to restore self-government in this country. I will vote for your withdrawal agreement when it returns to the House and I very much hope that the attorney general succeeds in securing final changes so that others might too. Although I campaigned to leave, I have always supported compromise to achieve a reconciliation in our country. Leaving the EU would represent an historic change and it is natural that some people will feel apprehensive. I have been open to the idea of using our existing membership of the EEA as an exit mechanism and I supported your approach outlined at Chequers when others did not. I have stuck with the government through a series of rather undignified retreats. However, I fear that developments this week will lead to a sequence of events culminating in the EU dictating the terms of any extension requested and the final humiliation of our country. I appreciate that you have been terribly undermined by those in parliament who refuse to respect the referendum result. You have shown tenacity and resilience over the past year. However, what our country needs from all its political leaders at this critical juncture is courage, and we are about to find out whether parliament has it. As a Defra Minister, I have enjoyed good relations with the European commission and with ministers from other member states. However, I do not believe that the commission has behaved honourably during these negotiations. They have deliberately made progress slow and difficult. They have stated in terms that they will refuse to even hold substantive negotiations on a future partnership until after we leave. If the position of Parliament is now that we will refuse to leave without an agreement then we are somewhat stuck. This is uncomfortable for everyone, but we cannot negotiate a successful Brexit unless we are prepared to walk through the door. We must therefore have the courage, if necessary, to reclaim our freedom first and talk afterwards. We must be ready to face down the European Union here and now. The absence of an agreement poses risks and costs for them too. We already know that in the event of \u201cno deal\u201d the EU will seek an informal transition period for nine months in many areas and settlement talks could continue within this window. I will do what I can from the back benches to try to salvage this sorry situation and I hope that, when the moment comes, Parliament will not let our country down. George Eustice, the Brexiter fisheries minister, has just announced his resignation from the government. He says he is opposed to Theresa May\u2019s decision to allow MPs a vote on extending article 50. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, has moved to quell concerns in Ireland after reports that Britain wanted to start a \u201cbeef trade war\u201d. Downing Street said there was still no firm date for the publication of the schedule of tariffs which was due last week. Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, told the Irish parliament that Lidington rang him to tell him he was concerned about the reports over beef wars and \u201cmade it clear to me that they were not coming from the British government\u201d. Coveney told MPs in the Dail there were \u201celements within the Westminster system that are frustrated that they cannot get over this issue of the backstop and want to see some pressure being applied to Ireland.\u201d Ireland is concerned about the prospect of tariffs with around 50% of its Beef exports going to the UK. Government briefings to food sector interests suggest that while tariffs threaten price rises, quotas will be used to counter that in areas such as beef where Britain relies on imports. This would mean little or no price rises on foods like beef and dairy imports. Labour will vote for a second referendum on Brexit when Theresa May tries to get her deal through parliament in the next fortnight, John McDonnell has said. And there is a chance Labour could win the vote, he claimed. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, has accused suspended MP Chris Williamson of being \u201cdeliberately inflammatory\u201d over antisemitism in the party, as he pledged to wage a personal battle to regain trust over the issue. Net migration to Britain from the EU has dropped to the lowest level for almost a decade, fuelled by falling numbers of eastern European citizens since the Brexit vote, even as migration from the rest of the world rose. The CBI and the Institute of Directors have expressed concern about the trend. (See 12.11pm.) Scotland could see the size of its workforce fall by up to 5% over two decades as a result of the UK government\u2019s immigration plans, an expert panel advising the Scottish government has said in a report (pdf). Summarising the findings, a Scottish government news release said: The report reveals the harm UK government proposals would have on Scotland, reducing migration by up to 50%, thereby jeopardising Scotland\u2019s economy, public services and future population growth. The advisory group also highlighted the disproportionate impact of the UK government\u2019s proposed salary threshold, under which people earning less than \u00a330,000 would not be allowed admittance to the UK. The group estimated 63% of workers in Scotland currently earn below that level, and that it would exclude a greater proportion of women than men as well as younger people at the start of their career. Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, has told MPs that TV adverts explaining the implications of a no-deal Brexit will be broadcast. Giving evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee, he said: Information [about no deal[ is available. We\u2019ve been putting it out on the website for several months, that\u2019s now been complemented by some radio advertising. We have plans to bring through some television advertising as well. So there is a communications campaign, but of course citizens and businesses are aware of that but they also look at the front pages and the news bulletins and they make a judgment, their own judgments, about the likelihood of no deal on 29 March. Sedwill told the committee that the government will make an announcement about \u201cnew towns\u201d next week. (See 11.04am.) He was speaking in response to a question about reports that the government will increase investment in leave-voting Labour areas, and the move is likely to be seen as part of a bid to encourage Labour MPs to back the government\u2019s Brexit deal. The government is also expected to announce new pledges on workers\u2019 rights next week - another strand of its strategy to win round opposition MPs on Brexit. Sedwill told the committee there was too much leaking from cabinet. He said: Ministers are entitled, and indeed are required, to exercise full candour in debating issues [in cabinet] before a decision is made, and expect to be able to able to do so in confidence. And, of course, the area in my view of collective responsibility that has been under most pressure - I can\u2019t put it quite as well as Peter Bone did yesterday in the House - is the breakdown in the confidentiality of those discussions. That is an issue that we are going to have to address as we work our way through this. The basic salary of an MP will rise by 2.7% from \u00a377,379 from to \u00a379,468 in April, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority has announced. And here is some more reaction to the immigration figures. (See 11.06am.) From Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary The data simply confirms the fakery behind the government\u2019s immigration policy. Once again the number of migrants coming here vastly outstrips its unworkable 100,000 net migration target. From Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford The overall story the data tell on EU migration is clear - Britain is not as attractive to EU migrants as it was a couple of years ago. EU net migration happened to be unusually high in the run-up to the referendum so at least some of this decline would probably have happened anyway even without Brexit. From Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said: It is a real concern that non-EU net migration has risen still further to more than a quarter of a million even before the government has implemented its proposals to loosen the work permit system. These are from the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge in Brussels. Here is some reaction to the migration figures out this morning, showing a sharp fall in net migration from the EU since the referendum, but an increase in net migration from outside the EU. (See 11.06am.) From Ed Davey, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Hospitals, schools and social care providers are already struggling to hire the staff they need, and Brexit is making that problem so much worse. Even before we\u2019ve left the EU, the chaos created by Tory ministers and the nasty rhetoric of Brexiters is putting off the EU workers that our public services badly need. From Matthew Fell, the CBI\u2019s chief UK policy director These figures confirm fewer EU workers are coming to the UK, exacerbating labour and skills shortages across many sectors, from farm labourers to engineers. Businesses cannot succeed without access skills and labour, which is why it\u2019s so important the government delivers a post-Brexit immigration system which is both open and controlled. From Tej Parikh, an economist at the Institute of Directors With job vacancies at record highs, recruiting from abroad has never been more crucial for British businesses. Flexible and hassle-free access to international skillsets is part and parcel of having a globally competitive skills regime, so adjusting to the government\u2019s post-Brexit immigration agenda, with its new restrictions, will present some challenges. Already, firms across the retail, hospitality and construction sectors are facing obstacles as some EU workers are returning home, while it\u2019s also becoming harder to attract labour from Europe amidst the uncertain political climate. From Stephen Clarke, an economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation thinktank While UK politicians are seemingly unable to provide any clarity on where Britain is heading post-Brexit, EU migrants are increasingly doing so \u2013 by leaving. EU migration is now at its lowest level in a decade \u2013 a fall that is being driven by fewer EU migrants coming to the UK for work. In contrast, migration from the rest of the world is close to a record high, though many of these migrants are coming to study rather than work. Post-Brexit Britain\u2019s migration system is still to be decided, and is years away from coming into effect. But many areas of the labour market \u2013 particularly firms in high-turnover sectors like hospitality who are reliant on the free movement of EU workers \u2013 are going to have to adjust to lower migration well before the new system is in place. From Prof Jonathan Portes, a fellow at UK in a Changing Europe, an academic network Today\u2019s migration statistics show a continued fall in EU migration \u2013 indeed, comparing today\u2019s data with the most recent labour force statistics, it is very likely that more Europeans are now leaving the UK than are arriving. This undoubtedly reflects the impact of Brexit on the attractiveness of the UK to other Europeans. Chris Williamson, who has been suspended from Labour for saying the party was \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d in response to complaints about antisemitism, has posted a message on Twitter thanking those Labour members who have supported him. Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, has told BBC\u2019s Radio 5 Live that the party\u2019s inquiry into Chris Williamson should take \u201cweeks, not months\u201d. In an interview with Emma Barnett, asked how long the investigation should take, he replied: It has to be very quick \u2026 I\u2019m not going to set a date but I do know our general secretary is under a lot of pressure on this ... I would imagine, in order to gather evidence and for him to have his case heard, it\u2019s probably a matter of weeks ... But it\u2019s definitely weeks not months, in my view. Curiously, Watson also insisted that he was not technically Corbyn\u2019s deputy. This may come as a surprise to anyone familiar with his job title but, in response to a question as to whether he was speaking out as Corbyn\u2019s deputy or in his own right (Barnett wanted to know why Corbyn was not giving interviews on Williamson), Watson explained: I\u2019m not actually Jeremy\u2019s deputy. I was elected by 200,000 Labour party members. I have my own mandate and I have a responsibility in light of that, which is why I am speaking out now. The Greek foreign ministry has uploaded a Brexit FAQs website for UK nationals living in the country. The \u201cGreece gets prepared for Brexit\u201d site comes a week after Athens\u2019 leftist government announced that the rights of all UK nationals resident in Greece - estimated at 45,000 - will be fully protected in the event of London crashing out of the EU without a deal. The site lists various FAQs under a picture of the Parthenon and, given the uncertainty, ends with \u201cmore questions ands answers to follow soon!\u201d Net migration from outside the EU has hit the highest level in nearly 15 years, as a post-Brexit plunge in arrivals from the bloc continued, new figures reveal. As the Press Association reports, overall, the balance between the numbers arriving in and leaving the UK remained above 250,000 - nearly three times the government\u2019s target level of below 100,000. Office for National Statistics data showed that 261,000 more non-EU citizens came to the country than left in the year ending September 2018. This was the highest estimate since 2004. EU net migration continued to add to the UK\u2019s population, but it almost halved year-on-year to 57,000 - a level last seen in 2009, the Press Association reports. Overall, around 283,000 more people moved to the UK with an intention to stay 12 months or more than left. At the public administration committee Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, has just told MPs that there will be an announcement about \u201cnew towns\u201d next week. He was responding to a question from Labour\u2019s Rupa Huq about reports that the government will increase investment in leave-voting Labour areas, in what is being seen by some as a move to encourage Labour MPs to vote for the government\u2019s Brexit deal. Alberto Costa, the Tory MP forced to resign as a parliamentary aide by Theresa May, has obliquely criticised the government\u2019s sluggish decision to back his EU migrants amendment as \u201cbetter late than never\u201d. Costa, a Scot who served as private parliamentary secretary to Scottish secretary David Mundell before effectively sacked for putting down the unauthorised amendment, robustly defended his actions in an interview with BBC Radio Scotland. He said his amendment, which instructs May to seek European Union guarantees on residency rights for EU migrants living in the UK after Brexit, and vice versa, had unified Westminster\u2019s parties for the first time since the Brexit vote in June 2016. He told Good Morning Scotland: I brought together all wings of my party, the Labour leader and his party, the SNP leader and his party, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, and his party, the Green party, the Welsh nationalists, Lady Herman, the DUP; it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve ever seen the House of Commons putting their name down to an amendment with full government backing, on a wholly uncontroversial issue. This morning, I\u2019m really pleased. Costa, the MP for South Leicestershire, and a lawyer, refused to discuss the nature of his dismissal, but said he and May had \u201ca full and frank discussion\u201d about his measure after prime minister\u2019s questions. There was significant levels of confusion at Westminster over whether May would endorse his proposal; she eventually did. I made it very clear to her that the whole house was brought together by my amendment; she confirmed she would give full government support, and you know what, all I care about are the rights of five million people. Asked whether he felt he had been a casualty of Brexit chaos, he said: \u201cWell there\u2019s an old idiom of better late than never.\u201d Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, has just started giving evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee. The Tory Brexiter David Jones has just asked him if there is any precedent for cabinet ministers openly arguing against government policy, as is happening now. He was referring to the way three pro-Europeans published a Daily Mail article on Saturday saying the government should rule out a no-deal Brexit. Sedwill appeared to concede that this was unprecedented, saying \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an exact parallel\u201d, although he subsequently said similar issues arose at the time of the Iraq war. He also admitted that there was too much leaking from cabinet. There has been a \u201cbreakdown\u201d in confidentiality, he said. Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader and shadow culture secretary, was on the Today programme this morning ahead of a speech he will give later on online gambling. My colleague Rob Davies has previewed the speech here. But Watson was also asked about wider Labour issues, particularly antisemitism. Here are the main points he made. Watson said the resignation of Luciana Berger last week was \u201cthe worst day of shame in the Labour Party\u2019s 120-year history\u201d. He would be meeting Jeremy Corbyn next week to discuss what more could be done to tackle antisemitism in the party. He explained: I\u2019ve asked to see Jeremy on Monday next week to talk about how we can further improve our measures to deal with antisemitism. When Luciana Berger left the Labour party, I thought it was the worst day of shame in the Labour party\u2019s 120-year history. A pregnant young MP bullied out of her own party by racist thugs. The one thing I say to my colleagues and half a million Labour party members is that I am not going to allow them to be tainted by racism, so I am going to speak out on antisemitism for as long as it takes to root it out and deal with it. There\u2019s individual responsibility here but there\u2019s also collective responsibility on the shadow cabinet and national executive committee to speak out and deal with it. He strongly criticised Chris Williamson, who was suspended from the party yesterday, saying some of Williamson\u2019s comments have been \u201calmost ... deliberately inflammatory\u201d. Watson said: Having monitored some of the things he\u2019s said in the last week, our general secretary decided that the pattern of behaviour over recent months was potentially bringing our party into disrepute, and so has suspended him from the party and there\u2019ll be an inquiry. He\u2019s entitled to a fair hearing but I\u2019ve been very, very concerned that his comments have almost been deliberately inflammatory and causing offence to not just parliamentary colleagues but people in the Jewish community who understandably have a real concern about antisemitism in the Labour party. He said he did not know whether or not, as has been claimed, someone from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office argued against Williamson being suspended. Watson failed to give Corbyn a wholehearted endorsement as a potential prime minister. When asked if Corbyn was fit to be prime minister, he replied: He could easily be prime minister. But, of course, we could do without the antisemitism because it allows you to ask me that question on the Today programme. We need to close these issues down and we do it by being absolutely vigilant in the way we deal with racism in our own ranks. That\u2019s on all of us. He confirmed that he wanted to set up a group for Labour MPs from the party\u2019s social democratic wing. He explained: For very understandable reasons in the party - to do with the challenge to Jeremy a couple of years ago and some MPs not wanting to serve - we\u2019ve not got a balance of traditions on our front bench. We can handle that, but it does mean there needs to be a different way of making sure that those traditions\u2019 voices are expressed in a different way on policy-making. There\u2019s no big issue about this but I do want the democratic socialist and the Christian socialist and the social democratic traditions to be heard in the parliamentary Labour party - if not on the front bench, to be heard by the front bench. In the Commons Nick Brown, the Labour chief whip, has just moved the writ for the Newport West byelection, caused by the death of Paul Flynn. It is due to take place on Thursday 4 April. After its Brexit amendment was defeated in the Commons last night, Labour is now officially committed to backing a second referendum. That does not mean that Jeremy Corbyn has become a passionate enthusiast for the idea, there are still many in the party who suspect that his office will manoeuvre to sabotage any such people\u2019s vote if it becomes a probability (not least because it would be hugely divisive), and there is no evidence that, even with Labour whipping its MPs, there is a majority for referendum legislation in the Commons. Still, David Cameron (if we believe Donald Tusk) and Nick Clegg (see here) are both available to give Corbyn some advice on what can happen when you back a referendum expecting it to never happen. And last night John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said there was a chance Labour could win a vote on a second referendum soon. In recent weeks McDonnell has become much more positive about the case for a second referendum than Corbyn and this is what he told ITV\u2019s Peston programme. When the meaningful vote comes back, and we\u2019re told maybe that might be March 12, that\u2019s the time when we\u2019ll have to put the [second referendum] amendment up. Let me just say, we\u2019re still going to argue we want a general election, we\u2019re still going to argue we think our deal that we put up is the best option, but we realise, we\u2019ve got to break this deadlock. We\u2019ve said we\u2019ll keep all the options on the table because we still want a general election. Things are shifting. There is a chance we could win it, and I\u2019ll tell you why. It\u2019s because people are worried about their constituencies, they\u2019re worried about jobs, they\u2019re worried about the economy. And I think the more we focus on that, the more there\u2019s a chance that either a deal will go through that will protect jobs and the economy, or to get some deal through it will be conditional on going back to the people. McDonnell also said that, even though his Hayes and Harlington constituency voted leave, he would vote remain in a second referendum, he would campaign for remain if there were a referendum. He explained: Yes I would [vote remain] because I did last time. I think it\u2019s the right thing to do. At the same time, I tell you, we\u2019ve got to respect people\u2019s views on this. My constituency voted leave, and I am going back all the time and explaining to the people in my constituency, this is why I\u2019ve come to this conclusion. Almost I\u2019ve been forced to. We\u2019ve gone through every path, there\u2019s been no deal that\u2019s been brought forward that is acceptable to parliament at the moment that would protect their jobs and their livelihoods, so we\u2019ve been forced into this situation where there\u2019s no other route that we can see other than this. After the vote last night Jeremy Corbyn himself also released a statement saying that the party would now \u201cback a public vote in order to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit or a disastrous no deal outcome\u201d. But he included a caveat, adding: We will also continue to push for the other available options to prevent those outcomes, including a close economic relationship based on our credible alternative plan or a general election. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 10am: Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, gives evidence to the Commons public administration committee. 10.40am: Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader and shadow culture secretary, gives a speech on online gambling. 4.30pm: Theresa May speaks at the end of the Jordan: Growth and Opportunity Conference, following talks with Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah in Downing Street earlier. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I finish, at around 5pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "The Labour MP David Lammy has denied snubbing Comic Relief after he became embroiled in a dispute with the television journalist and Strictly Come Dancing winner Stacey Dooley. Lammy had accused Dooley of perpetuating \u201ctired and unhelpful stereotypes\u201d about Africa after she travelled to Uganda for an upcoming Comic Relief documentary. The MP for Tottenham criticised her on Twitter after she shared pictures on social media of her trip including one of her posing with a young child. Dooley responded by inviting Lammy to travel to the continent himself while Comic Relief suggested the MP had snubbed an offer to collaborate with the charity on a film in Africa. Lammy said it was \u201csimply not true\u201d that he had not responded to the offer, adding he had held two meetings with the organisation. Lammy claimed Comic Relief had \u201cfallen short\u201d of what he called its \u201cpublic duty\u201d to promote racial equality and serve minority communities. Comic Relief on Thursday made no apologies, saying the offer of a collaborative film was \u201cstill open\u201d. It thanked Dooley for helping people \u201cworking with or supported by Comic Relief projects tell their own stories in their own words\u201d. Lammy initially had responded to the pictures posted on Instagram by Dooley by tweeting: \u201cThe world does not need any more white saviours. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, this just perpetuates tired and unhelpful stereotypes. Let\u2019s instead promote voices from across the continent of Africa and have serious debate.\u201d Lammy said his issue was not \u201cpersonal\u201d with Dooley and he did not question her \u201cgood motives\u201d. However, he said he had a problem with \u201cBritish celebrities\u201d being flown out to Africa for Red Nose Day to make films that send \u201ca distorted image\u201d of the continent and perpetuate \u201can old idea from the colonial era\u201d. Lammy, who is of Guyanese descent, said \u201cmany black\u201d Britons are \u201cdeeply uncomfortable\u201d with Comic Relief\u2019s \u201cpoverty porn\u201d. Dooley, who has made documentaries for the BBC on topics including fast fashion and an Islamic State sex slave, responded by suggesting the politician should raise awareness of poverty himself. She tweeted: \u201cDavid, is the issue with me being white? (Genuine question) ... because if that\u2019s the case, you could always go over there and try [to] raise awareness? \u201cComic relief have raised over 1 billion pounds since they started. I saw projects that were saving lives with the money. Kids lives.\u201d Lammy said he \u201cwas not prepared to become part of a PR exercise\u201d. On Twitter, he wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s simply not true to say I did not respond: we had two meetings in my office.

The Comic Relief chief executive, Liz Warner, told the Guardian last year that films for Comic Relief and Sport Relief would depict \u201cpeople talking in the first person in their own voices, with local heroes and local heroines talking to us about the work they\u2019re doing\u201d. It followed criticism of Ed Sheeran for reinforcing \u201cwhite saviour\u201d stereotypes during a visit to Liberia. Red Nose Day takes place on 15 March.",

But little has changed in Britain\u2019s approach to counter-terrorism, soon to undergo independent review following years of heavy criticism.</p> <p>The Prevent strategy places entire communities under suspicion without necessarily being effective.

A \u20ac2.5m <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37454697\" title=\"\">French deradicalisation boot camp</a> in the Loire valley asked participants to sing the national anthem, eat non-halal food and learn \u201cRepublican values\u201d without rehabilitating a single individual.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The ummah, or 'community of believers', attunes many young British Muslims to suffering and injustice in other countries</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When policymakers talk about preventing \u201cradicalisation\u201d, they are missing the point: there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with being radical. The term can simply mean rejection of the status quo. The French and American revolutions, universal suffrage and the end of colonialism all involved political subversion. Politics has long been ideological and international. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/10/orwell-hero-terrorism-syria-british-fighters-damned\" title=\"\">Think George Orwell and the Spanish civil war</a>).</p> <p>Yet still we talk about Muslim youth in the hackneyed language of the early 2000s, in which \u201cradical\u201d ideas must be neutralised through social engineering. A good (Muslim) citizenry, in this logic, is politically docile, disengaged from world affairs and discouraged from combining religion with political activism.</p> <p>Muslims of my generation, growing up in the 70s and 80s, were inspired by radical ideas derived from secular humanism. Confronted with racial and social injustice in Britain, many of us found solace and solidarity in third worldism and socialist internationalism \u2013 without subscribing to indiscriminate violence.</p> <p>Muslims in the UK who have grown up after 2001 have done so in an era of nihilistic surrender to the capitalist world order and the political status quo. Unsurprisingly, some have veered towards one or the other current extremes of political Islam.</p> <p>Of course, the reasons hundreds were seduced by the death cult of Isis cannot be explained solely by a lack of alternatives. Recruitment was driven as much by crass adventurism and bloodlust. The public is justified in feeling revulsion towards returning marauders, whose crimes should be prosecuted with the full force of British and international law. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/oct/18/miqdaad-versi-very-polite-fight-against-british-media-islamophobia\">One man\u2019s (very polite) fight against media Islamophobia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the choices of a few cannot be allowed to bar generations of young Muslims from trying to change the world.

Visiting relatives can have an impact on them in ways that go beyond the fleeting experience of the average student gap year.</p> <p>British education generally fails to engage positively with this cosmopolitanism, offering few opportunities to study Islam\u2019s complex encounter with modernity.

To be clear: theologically grounded attempts to bring social change are beset with problems. But rather than treat young British Muslims as children in need of inoculation against the dangers of politics, how about providing an authentic political education, distinguishing progressive ideas from retrograde ones through informed debate?</p> <p>The introduction of Muslim history to the curriculum would no doubt be controversial in Britain. The rightwing press <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/648075/Schools-teach-Islamic-history-ignore-British\" title=\"\">loudly protests</a> against the addition of \u201cworld history\u201d at the expense of British kings and queens.

      "bodyText": "The legal and moral conundrums posed by the return (or not) of British jihadis following the collapse of the Islamic State \u201ccaliphate\u201d has triggered renewed anxiety about the place of Muslim youth in western society. The home secretary, Sajid Javid\u2019s populist bid to strip Shamima Begum of citizenship has heightened the pitch of an emotive debate. But little has changed in Britain\u2019s approach to counter-terrorism, soon to undergo independent review following years of heavy criticism. The Prevent strategy places entire communities under suspicion without necessarily being effective. European equivalents have fared similarly. A \u20ac2.5m French deradicalisation boot camp in the Loire valley asked participants to sing the national anthem, eat non-halal food and learn \u201cRepublican values\u201d without rehabilitating a single individual. When policymakers talk about preventing \u201cradicalisation\u201d, they are missing the point: there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with being radical. The term can simply mean rejection of the status quo. The French and American revolutions, universal suffrage and the end of colonialism all involved political subversion. Politics has long been ideological and international. (Think George Orwell and the Spanish civil war). Yet still we talk about Muslim youth in the hackneyed language of the early 2000s, in which \u201cradical\u201d ideas must be neutralised through social engineering. A good (Muslim) citizenry, in this logic, is politically docile, disengaged from world affairs and discouraged from combining religion with political activism. Muslims of my generation, growing up in the 70s and 80s, were inspired by radical ideas derived from secular humanism. Confronted with racial and social injustice in Britain, many of us found solace and solidarity in third worldism and socialist internationalism \u2013 without subscribing to indiscriminate violence. Muslims in the UK who have grown up after 2001 have done so in an era of nihilistic surrender to the capitalist world order and the political status quo. Unsurprisingly, some have veered towards one or the other current extremes of political Islam. Of course, the reasons hundreds were seduced by the death cult of Isis cannot be explained solely by a lack of alternatives. Recruitment was driven as much by crass adventurism and bloodlust. The public is justified in feeling revulsion towards returning marauders, whose crimes should be prosecuted with the full force of British and international law. But the choices of a few cannot be allowed to bar generations of young Muslims from trying to change the world. Rather than view them with fear, a supposedly open society like the UK should ask how their dynamic potential can be allowed to flourish. The ummah, or \u201ccommunity of believers\u201d, wherever in the world they are, is a powerful idea among many young British Muslims, attuning them to suffering and injustice in other countries. Many have family that originated in Asia and Africa. Visiting relatives can have an impact on them in ways that go beyond the fleeting experience of the average student gap year. British education generally fails to engage positively with this cosmopolitanism, offering few opportunities to study Islam\u2019s complex encounter with modernity. From Abdul Ghaffar Khan (the \u201cFrontier Gandhi\u201d) to the Iranian revolutionary Ali Shariati and Malcolm X, there are many examples of religiously inspired figures playing a legitimate role in opposing colonialism, racism and injustice. To be clear: theologically grounded attempts to bring social change are beset with problems. But rather than treat young British Muslims as children in need of inoculation against the dangers of politics, how about providing an authentic political education, distinguishing progressive ideas from retrograde ones through informed debate? The introduction of Muslim history to the curriculum would no doubt be controversial in Britain. The rightwing press loudly protests against the addition of \u201cworld history\u201d at the expense of British kings and queens. But the fears of parents reported to be removing children from RE lessons to prevent them learning about Islam can be allayed with facts. Since 2014, three of Britain\u2019s five exam boards have actually removed discussion of Israel-Palestine or the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict from their GCSE offerings. In 2015, white students were twice as likely to opt for history A-level than students of Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage. At university level, Britain\u2019s 94% white academic staff in history is significantly less diverse than the UK population. As the school strikes movement and broader youth mobilisation on climate change are showing, youthful idealism and radical political action are indispensable. Young Pakistani and Bangladeshi Britons, whose parents\u2019 countries of origin will be among the worst affected by global warming, could make important contributions to this fight and others, such as the struggle for fair pay and conditions for workers in cities such as the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka. The smattering of British Muslims who already occupy prominent positions in public life may identify with Islam, or reject faith-based politics altogether. An unknown number, perhaps taking inspiration from our own home secretary, will have no truck with socialism whatsoever. That is their prerogative. It is also the right of British Muslim organisations doing charitable, social or political work for local communities and distant societies to espouse theology as a source of inspiration without being met by oppressive policing. As for the secular left, whose tendency to view religion as \u201cthe opium of the people\u201d retains some currency in radical environmental circles, it may find there is something to gain from reflecting on Muslim history, and indeed other religious traditions. Bruno Latour admitted as much in a 2008 lecture on ecotheology, in which he speculated on reasons for the green movement\u2019s failure to capture people\u2019s imaginations. So, rather than intimidating British Muslims or viewing them with condescension, perhaps British society could consider how their concern for the ummah might actually be a resource for this country, and indeed the human species in its battle against extinction. (God knows) we need all the help we can get. \u2022 Ali Nobil Ahmad is a researcher at the Leibniz Zentrum Moderner Orient in Berlin and former recipient of the Scott Trust bursary",
