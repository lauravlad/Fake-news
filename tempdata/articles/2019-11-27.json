But it identifies the Conservative MP, <strong>Zac Goldsmith</strong>, as being in particular danger, as well as the shadow environment secretary, <strong>Sue Hayman</strong>, and the shadow Scotland secretary, <strong>Lesley Laird</strong>.</p> \n  <p>While the poll suggests <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> could comfortably retain his seat if the election were held right now, the margin of error identified by YouGov allows for an extremely narrow Labour victory in the same scenario.</p> \n  <p>It suggests similar of other cabinet ministers, including the foreign secretary, <strong>Dominic Raab</strong>, the justice secretary, <strong>Robert Buckland</strong>, and the Scottish secretary, <strong>Alister Jack,</strong> as well as the international development secretary, <strong>Alok Sharma.</strong></p> \n  <p>None of them is predicted to be in any serious danger. Like Johnson, YouGov rates each of them as \u201clikely\u201d to hold their seat. But, were the results out by the most extreme margins of error YouGov has allowed for, election night could be less comfortable than each would hope.</p> \n  <p>The poll predicts that the environment secretary, <strong>Theresa Villers</strong>, could have an even greater fight on her hands, were the vote held right now.<strong> </strong>YouGov projects the race in her constituency to be one of the closest, rating it a \u201ctossup\u201d.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddf05f28f087410d98740e1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/dan-sabbagh\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-27T23:29:44.404Z\">11.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The result of YouGov\u2019s constituency by constituency model makes seductive reading for the Conservatives and grim reading for Labour.<br></p> \n  <p>Can you believe it?</p> \n  <p>What YouGov has in its favour was its success last time: Nine days before the last election, the firm predicted <strong>Theresa May\u2019s</strong> Conservatives would lose their majority and end up with just 310 seats.</p> \n  <p>In fact, the party got 317 but it came at a time when few other pollsters were predicting anything other than a May win.</p> \n  <p>What YouGov has against it is that it has been polling people over the past week, when regular polling firms would aim for the last couple of days. And, during an election campaign, every day matters.</p> \n  <p>A week ago, neither party manifesto was out, the leaders debate hadn\u2019t happened and the antisemitism row hadn\u2019t surfaced. More importantly, while the Conservative squeeze of the Brexit party has come early in this campaign, the Labour squeeze of the Lib Dems is perhaps not yet complete.</p> \n  <p>There are some things in the forecast that look curious. Labour is not forecast to gain any seats at all, which will surprise party workers in some targets where it has dozens on the ground, such as Southampton Itchen (Con maj 31), Hastings and Rye (Con maj 346) and Chingford and Woodford Green (Con maj 2438).</p> \n  <p>But it will hit home in the critical \u201cred wall\u201d band that runs very roughly from north Wales to the Humber, where Labour insiders are already deeply concerned, with some party workers reporting a sharp fall in those willing to say they will back the party.</p> \n  <p>The modelling suggests the Conservatives will gain seat after seat in Britain\u2019s smaller cities and large towns: Wrexham (Lab maj 1,832), Derby North (Lab maj 2,015), Great Grimsby (2,565), despite the residual presence of the Brexit party.</p> \n  <p>Even West Bromwich East, previously held for Labour by <strong>Tom Watson</strong> with a majority of 7,713, is projected to change hands, and interestingly most of the seats projected to switch are straight Conservative versus Labour battles. In only a handful, such as Kensington in London, does a Lib Dem revival split the anti-Tory vote.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-27T23:41:11.725Z\">at 11.41pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddeed1f8f08dcf251b4a5b5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/carolinedavies\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-27T22:33:05.411Z\">10.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> is set to unveil more proposals in the Labour\u2019s \u201cGreen manifesto\u201d tomorrow, telling supporters at a packed rally in Cornwall this evening: \u201cI\u2019ll let you into little secret, it\u2019s brilliant\u201d.<br></p> \n  <p>Speaking at the event in Falmouth to promote the party\u2019s \u201cGreen Industrial Revolution\u201d, the Labour leader said the 2016 Paris climate agreement did not go far enough. He told hundreds of cheering supporters:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I want to lead a Labour government that next year will host the next climate change conference, and which will be much stronger than Paris.</p> \n   <p>Our government will be one that will be very environmentally conscious, it will bring about a net zero emissions. Our government will work on the world stage to achieve that as well.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Labour\u2019s \u201cGreen Industrial Revolution\u201d includes a 10-year Green transformation fund, costing \u00a325bn a year, and dedicated to renewable and low carbon energy, transport, biodiversity, and environmental restoration.</p> \n  <p>It promises to create 1m green jobs in the energy sector and through nationwide home refurbishments.</p> \n  <p>The idea is to tackle climate change while creating jobs through insulation upgrades, offshore wind and carbon capture. The jobs will also come from hydrogen and tidal energy expansion, port infrastructure, tree-planting, flood defences and plastics recycling.</p> \n  <p>With just two weeks until the election, Corbyn warned supporters:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Everything is going to be thrown at us in the next two weeks. Every bit of abuse that the right wing press can find. Every bit of abuse that the wealthiest in our society can throw at people that want to bring about real change.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddef6a88f08dcf251b4a5f3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-27T22:22:38.195Z\">10.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Chris Curtis</strong>, YouGov\u2019s political research manager, said the pollster\u2019s election MRP model suggests the Tories\u2019 projected gains could come at the expense of Labour in northern England and the Midlands.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As expected, the key thing deciding the extent to which each of these seats is moving against Labour are how that seat voted in the European Union referendum. In the seats that voted most strongly to Leave in 2016 (60% or more in favour of departing the EU), the swing to the Conservatives is over 6%.</p> \n   <p>This is allowing the Tories to overturn quite substantial majorities in places like West Bromwich East, the seat held until recently by Tom Watson, and Don Valley, the seat currently held by Caroline Flint.</p> \n   <p>The only silver lining for Labour is that there are still 30 seats where it is currently 5% or less behind the Tories. If it can manage to squeeze the gap over the coming fortnight it may be able to paste over the cracks in their so-called red wall. But, with just two weeks to go, time is running out for Labour.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddef1e38f08cd6fe586d0fd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-27T22:08:43.103Z\">10.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Poll predicts Conservative majority</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Tories could be on track for a majority of 68 seats, according to one poll published this evening.</p> \n  <p>The YouGov poll for the Times suggests that, were the election to be held right now, the Conservatives could win 359 seats, against 211 for Labour, 43 for the SNP 43 and 13 for the Lib Dems 13.</p> \n  <p>Those results would see the Tories up 42 seats on 2017 and Labour down 51.</p> \n  <p>The paper reports that the seat-by-seat analysis was based on more than 100,000 interviews conducted over seven days and produced using a polling model that accurately predicted the outcome of the 2017 election.</p> \n  <p>However, the Times reports, at least 30 seats have relatively small projected margins of victory for the Conservatives.

His appointment at No 10 came only four months after he was found in contempt of parliament for refusing to appear before MPs investigating false news stories during the EU referendum campaign.</p> \n

Eight hours later, now that journalists have had time to study the contents of the documents (which it turns out were leaked and published in an obscure corner of the internet some weeks ago), it turns out that the material is not quite as incriminating as Corbyn implied. The documents, which set out what has been said in talks between UK and US officials over the last two years scoping out the parameters for a trade deal, do not show that the government has agreed to anything that would let American corporations take over the NHS, or that would result in the NHS having to pay higher prices for drugs. But what the documents do confirm is that the Americans do have ambitions in these areas and that, despite ministers claiming that the NHS is \u201cnot on the table\u201d, the healthcare sector has been discussed (albeit not extensively) in these preliminary trade talks. <strong>Liz Truss</strong>, the international trade secretary, accused Corbyn of lying about the document. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/27/general-election-leaders-try-to-steer-campaign-away-from-race-and-faith-live?page=with:block-5dde67d98f08dcf251b49f3a#block-5dde67d98f08dcf251b49f3a\">In a statement</a> she said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn</a> is getting desperate and is out-and-out lying to the public about what these documents contain.

That is because in the end what would be decided in a UK-US trade deal would depend on the political dynamics at the end of the talks (not on anything in this 451-page bundle) and any judgement that voters make at this point will be a matter of trust. Any government would think twice before signing a trade deal that would imperil the NHS, because that would be politically toxic.

The SNP says that would mean \u00a335bn extra in day to day NHS spending in England by 2023/24 compared to this year \u2013 more than any other party proposes.</p> \n  <p><em>Background: </em>Every party boasts it will increase NHS spending but this is an audacious policy. Health policy in Scotland is totally devolved to Holyrood and the SNP has no remit over the NHS in England. Historically, Scotland has spent more on health than the rest of the UK because it has a far more dispersed rural population, many islands to service and higher rates of ill-health.</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon argues this extra English spending is justified to rectify the impacts of past austerity policies and, because Scottish funding is derived in part by how much is spent on the NHS in England, her government will get \u00a34bn more from the Treasury in 2023/24.</p> \n  <p><em>Reality:</em> Ben Zaranko, an analyst at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says Labour plans to raise day to day NHS spending in England by \u00a331.2bn by 2023/24; the Tories by \u00a328.6bn and the Lib Dems by \u00a330.5bn.</p> \n  <p>The SNP claims its plans would mean total English day-to-day NHS spending of \u00a3159.2bn in 2023/24. The IFS has different calculations. It says that Labour plans means the English NHS will have \u00a3154.9bn to spend in 2023/24 compared to \u00a3158.7bn under the SNP\u2019s plans. That \u00a33.8bn is a relatively small increase of 2.45%.</p> \n  <p><em>Verdict:</em> Sturgeon is right that the SNP\u2019s proposals means higher NHS spending than the other parties propose. But the effects are not as great as the headline figure suggests and by 2023/24, NHS spending targets are almost certain to change as time goes on.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2019-11-27T17:37:26/embed.html\" data-alt=\"NHS spending plans from main parties\"> \n   <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2019-11-27T17:37:26/embed.html\">NHS spending plans from main parties</a> \n   <figcaption>\n    NHS spending plans from main parties\n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddeaecb8f08cd6fe586ce1f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-27T17:16:41.240Z\">5.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>There have been a lot of polls now suggesting the Conservatives are on course for at least a decent majority.

Under this scenario, Labour would win 199 seats, Lib Dems would win 17 seats, SNP would win 44 seats, Plaid would win 4 seats and the Greens would win 1 seat.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>A result like this would translate into a majority of around 82. The press notice goes on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>However, if 4,000 or less pro-EU voters use their vote tactically in Best for Britain\u2019s 57 target seats, the Conservatives would be reduced to 309 seats \u2013 a dozen short of a majority. Labour would win 244 seats, SNP would win 52 seats, Lib Dems would win 21 seats, Plaid would win 4 seats and the Greens would win 1 seat ...</p> \n   <p>Despite the boost received by the Conservatives from the Brexit party, there is still a substantial number of seats where tactical voting could be decisive. There are 165 seats where fewer than 5,000 tactical votes would be enough to prevent the Conservative party winning the seat (compared to 131 at the beginning of the election campaign). In 27 of these it would take fewer than 2,000 tactical votes.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Best for Britain is encouraging people to vote tactically in accordance with the recommendations on<a href=\"https://tacticalvote.getvoting.org/\"> its tactical voting website.</a></p> \n  <p>However, as I reported in a post on Monday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/25/general-election-corbyn-to-make-big-housing-pledge-as-tories-set-low-spending-bar-live?page=with:block-5ddbfb448f080fd59fb170ac#block-5ddbfb448f080fd59fb170ac\">there are at least four other tactical voting websites which in some cases make different recommendations.</a></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddea7ae8f087410d9873d30\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-27T16:43:58.685Z\">4.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ba27c0a5fd041326dcf1dd7b3a17143e051bce6\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ba27c0a5fd041326dcf1dd7b3a17143e051bce6/0_52_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lord Heseltine (centre) alongside Liberal Democrat candidates Chuka Umunna (left) and Monica Harding (right) at a Lib Dem event in London this afternoon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lord Heseltine (centre) alongside Liberal Democrat candidates Chuka Umunna (left) and Monica Harding (right) at a Lib Dem event in London this afternoon.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddea5ed8f08cd6fe586cd8f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/richardadams\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-27T16:39:27.082Z\">4.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The<strong> National Education Union</strong> - the merged NUT and ATL teachers\u2019 unions - has released polling it commissioned of 1,000 voters with school-aged children in England, showing that 38% of parents plan to back Labour, compared with 33% for the Conservatives, 11% for Lib Dems, 9% for the Brexit party, and 4% for the Green party (excluding don\u2019t knows).</p> \n  <p>The polling breakdown showed a sharp division by age: 41% of those aged 18-34 backed Labour but just 27% of those aged 35-54.

Tom Bacon, freelance journalist in the entertainment sector, Ormskirk</em><br></p> \n  <p>Hi Tom. So Jeremy Corbyn was right when he told my colleague Kate Proctor earlier this week that his plans wouldn\u2019t put the UK significantly out of line with other European countries, in terms of tax and spending and the size of the state.</p> \n  <p>But it\u2019s the speed of the transformation that is so striking: the manifesto envisages a radical transformation of the economy and the role of government, in just five years. As director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies Paul Johnson put it, \u201cthis would be the biggest set of spending increases, and the biggest set of tax increases, and the biggest set of borrowing increases we\u2019ve seen in peacetime history\u201d.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What does the nationalisation of Openreach mean for the thousands of people currently working for Openreach\u2019s competitors? There seems to have been no mention of this, with the implication being that given there will be no need for competitors of British Broadband, that their job losses will be the price to pay for \u2018free\u2019 broadband. Sam, West Midlands</em></p> \n  <p>Good question, Sam. My colleague Peter Walker actually asked about the fate of those companies at the launch event for the broadband policy. The answer he was given was that they could continue to provide add-on services, such as subscription TV packages. But you\u2019re right, the expectation would be that their broadband operations would wither away (while BT Openreach \u2013 renamed British Broadband \u2013 would expand its operations significantly, presumably).</p> \n  <p><em>Q: I\u2019m aware that Labour are planning to decriminalise abortion \u2013 which I am wholly supportive of. However, I\u2019m not clear on whether this also changes the law on the latest a woman can legally terminate? Many Tory supporters I know are posting pro-life website claims that abortion will be made legal at any point during pregnancy even when the baby is fully developed. I do not believe this to be true but struggling to find the details on the changes labour intend to make to abortion law and would like clarification. Nicole, Hertfordshire</em></p> \n  <p>Hi Nicole. I\u2019m really interested (and concerned) to hear that that\u2019s out there, because it\u2019s not true. The only reference to abortion policy in the manifesto says: \u201cWe will uphold women\u2019s reproductive rights and decriminalise abortions.\u201d There is no reference to any plan to review the current policy.

So yes: the manifesto says a Labour government would make reducing health inequalities a clear target of public policy. </p> \n  <p>The \u00a31bn planned increase in public health funding is part of that, and they say they would recruit 4,500 more health visitors and school nurses \u2013 and take a series of other steps on everything from increasing breastfeeding support for new mums, to widening the scope of the sugar tax to tackle obesity.</p> \n  <p>To try and make the target stick, they also say they would introduce a new Future Generations Wellbeing Act: a law aimed at forcing the government to check the impact of all new policy on health inequality; and a new obligation on NHS agencies to cooperate with directors of public health.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-27T13:51:30.650Z\">at 1.51pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dde75568f08dcf251b49fe8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/severincarrell\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-27T13:14:03.152Z\">1.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> has said the Scottish National party would have \u201cno great objection\u201d if Jeremy Corbyn was replaced as Labour leader, and hinted strongly she would support that if it helped form an anti-Tory coalition at Westminster.</p> \n  <p>The SNP leader said she \u201cdidn\u2019t get to choose who leads the Labour party\u201d but repeated several times at the launch of her party\u2019s election manifesto she was no fan of Corbyn\u2019s.</p> \n  <p>Asked whether the SNP would support replacing Corbyn as party leader if there were moves to do so at Westminster, to build a cross-party coalition with Labour, she said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don\u2019t choose the leader of the Labour party.

Labour\u2019s manifesto says it will \u201ctake urgent steps to refresh our democracy\u201d, and commits to a series of specific changes, including abolishing the hereditary principle in the House of Lords and lowering the voting age to 16; but there is no mention of voting reform.</p> \n  <p>It does say the reboot of democracy will be guided by a UK-wide constitutional convention, led by a citizens\u2019 assembly. Its appears to be mainly focused on the balance of power between Westminster and the rest of the UK; but perhaps voting reform might emerge as a recommendation?

Eric Ekong, 28, software engineer, London</em></p> \n  <p>So I haven\u2019t seen Jeremy Corbyn make that commitment explicitly, Eric, but he has repeatedly highlighted the gender balance in his shadow cabinet, and contrasted that with the Conservatives\u2019 more male-dominated top team. So while he hasn\u2019t committed to keeping everyone in the same jobs if he got into Downing Street, I think it\u2019s highly likely he would maintain a balance.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-27T13:52:59.799Z\">at 1.52pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dde6c878f08dcf251b49f78\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-27T12:59:19.113Z\">12.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">What Tories are saying about UK-US trade talks dossier</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here are the main points from the Conservative rebuttal released in response to the leaked UK-US trade talks dossier, and what Jeremy Corbyn was saying about it.

They say:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In his press conference, Jeremy Corbyn highlighted the following quote: \u2018The impact of some patent issues raised on NHS access to generic drugs (i.e. cheaper drugs) will be a key consideration going forward\u2019 (13-14 November 2017, p.51) and suggested that this meant that the Government would allow drug prices to rise. This is a lie.</p> \n   <p>Corbyn has quoted this section out of context. This was officials flagging a potential issue that the UK has to avoid in the future trade talks. </p> \n   <p>The conversation that the paper reports on was a preliminary conversation in which the \u2018US focus was on explaining their legislation and approach in FTAs [free trade agreements]\u2019.</p> \n   <p>The paper also notes that there was only a \u2018limited discussion on pharmaceutical protection\u2019. The reason this was only a limited conversation was \u2018given sensitivities in this area related to the NAFTA negotiations\u2019 (13-14 November 2017, p.44).</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Tories say the documents show the Americans accept that the UK does not want to include the NHS in a deal.</strong> They say (bold in original):</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The notes make clear that, at the very start of the discussions, that the US team are aware that the UK won\u2019t accept any attempt to put the NHS on the table: \u2018Nursing was the other profession that the US was interested in... The US were interested to know if it would be really problematic for the UK to act in this area \u2013 <strong>they were sensitive to the particular sensitivities with the health sector in the UK.\u2019</strong> (24-25 July 2017, p.24)</p> \n   <p>Subsequent papers also state that \u2018<strong>we do not currently believe the US has a major offensive interest in this [health] space</strong>\u2019 (March 2018, p.53).</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Tories say the documents show that, although the US \u201cprobed\u201d the UK position, the British stressed that they did not want to include the health service in a deal.</strong> They say (bold in original):</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The papers only show that USTR [US trade representative] \u2018probed UK position on our \u201chealth insurance\u201d system\u2019 (21-22 March 2018). The same document shows that the UK response made clear that \u2018Wouldn\u2019t want to discuss particular health care entities\u2026 <strong>we need to protect our needs</strong>; this would be something to discuss further down the line when we come to <strong>consider what entities would count as \u2018enterprises\u2019\u2019</strong>.

Where would the money to back up the abolition of tuition fees for undergraduate and postgraduate courses come from? And how would that affect the economy given the astronomical fees that students currently pay/get a loan from? Carina Nicu, 27 years old, research technician at the University of Manchester, Manchester</em></p> \n  <p>Hi Carina, you\u2019re right that abolishing tuition fees and restoring maintenance grants is the single most costly measure in the manifesto, at \u00a313.6bn a year by the end of the parliament. </p> \n  <p>Labour says almost half of that, \u00a36.4bn, will be offset by the savings from getting rid of the current system (it\u2019s costly to administer, and many students have their fees written off anyway). They would also argue that ensuring kids from lower-income households are not deterred from going to university would have wider social/economic benefits \u2013 though of course it wouldn\u2019t just be these students who would benefit.</p> \n  <p>Labour haven\u2019t earmarked specific taxes to pay for each spending measure \u2013 but their biggest money-raiser is increasing corporation tax, which is expected to bring in a whopping \u00a323.7bn a year within five years. The impact of that on the wider economy is contested: Labour say they\u2019re just taking it back to 2010 levels, and the 26% rate still won\u2019t be high by international standards.</p> \n  <p>Critics say it will deter foreign investment \u2013 and that part of the cost will ultimately be passed on to customers and workers, as well as wealthy executives and shareholders.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Are there any concrete measures for EU nationals living in the UK (in the context of Brexit) in the Labour manifesto? Sabrina </em></p> \n  <p>Hi Sabrina. Yes: the Labour manifesto reiterates the party\u2019s longstanding commitment to uphold the rights of EU citizens already in the UK to remain here. </p> \n  <p>And it goes a bit further, saying a Labour government would get rid of the legal requirement to register under the EU settlement scheme. It would instead become a \u201cdeclaratory system\u201d, under which EU citizens could register if they wished, but it wouldn\u2019t be a requirement for continuing to live and work here, the manifesto says. (It doesn\u2019t say how that would work for employers wondering if a particular individual has the right to be here). Labour would also expand the right of all migrants to bring their families to the UK.</p> \n  <p>As for freedom of movement, that would depend on what happens with Brexit.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-27T13:55:45.417Z\">at 1.55pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dde6be48f08cd6fe586ca9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/heatherstewart\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-27T12:30:50.910Z\">12.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I\u2019m Heather Stewart, political editor of the Guardian, and will be answering your questions about the Labour manifesto today.

Here it is in full.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The US pushing lower food standards on Britain post Brexit, including allowing imports of chlorine-washed chickens, less nutritional labelling on foods, and less protection for regional food like stilton cheese. The US offered to help the UK government \u2018sell\u2019 chlorine chicken to a sceptical British public and stated that parliamentary scrutiny of food standards is \u2018unhelpful\u2019.</p> \n   <p>The US banning any mention of climate change in a US-UK trade deal.</p> \n   <p>US officials threatening UK civil servants that they would undermine US trade talks if they supported certain EU positions in international forums.</p> \n   <p>The US suggesting a \u2018corporate court system\u2019 in a US-UK deal, which would allow big business to sue the British government, in secret and without appeal, for anything they regard as \u2018unfair\u2019. Recent similar cases have included suing governments for trying to phase out use of coal.</p> \n   <p>US officials pushing a far reaching proposals on the digital economy, giving big tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon sweeping freedoms to move and use our online data, which would make taxation and regulation of these companies more difficult and prohibit Labour proposals for a public broadband service.</p> \n   <p>Threats to public services like the NHS, via sweeping services liberalisation. The British government would need to exclude everything not subject to liberalisation in order to protect public services, while bringing formerly public services like the mail, or rail companies back into public ownership would be much harder.</p> \n   <p>US officials making a further threat to NHS in terms of medicine pricing policy, with special concern about Brits paying more for cancer medicines which the US feels Britain doesn\u2019t pay enough for. Trade negotiators have received special lobbying from pharmaceutical corporations as part of the trade talks.</p> \n   <p>US officials demanding US experts and multinational corporations are able to participate in standard-setting in Britain post Brexit.</p> \n   <p>A promise by both sides to keep talks secret from the public.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-27T12:21:18.805Z\">at 12.21pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dde60918f08cd6fe586ca05\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-27T11:40:34.810Z\">11.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ask our experts a question</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As part of a new series you can ask our political team any questions you have about the general election, and they will post their responses on the politics live blog between 12.30pm and 1.30pm every Monday, Wednesday and Friday until polling week.<br></p> \n  <p>Today, the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/26/ask-us-a-question-what-do-you-want-to-know-about-the-labour-manifesto\">political editor, Heather Stewart, will answer your questions about the Labour manifesto</a>, campaign and policies, just how realistic the pledges are and what they might mean for you.

We have had surprise announcements from the parties about policy, and about strategy (eg, the Brexit party standing down in Tory-held seats), but this is a proper news story about stuff that has happened, not stuff that might happen in the future. </p> \n  <p>Labour will be hoping that this has the potential to be a game-changer. (The charge that the NHS would be \u201cup for sale\u201d in a UK-US trade deal is one that resonates with voters, and alarms them, in a way that many Westminster policy/process stories don\u2019t.) In reality, very few things that happen in election campaigns turn out to be game-changer, but this may turn out to have enough heft to make the grade.</p> \n  <p>This is what <strong>Jeremy Corbyn </strong>said about the documents in his opening speech.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Voters need to ask themselves some very serious questions: is the NHS safe in Boris Johnson\u2019s hands?</p> \n   <p>We\u2019ve now got evidence that under Boris Johnson the NHS is on the table and will be up for sale. He tried to cover it up in a secret agenda but today it\u2019s been exposed.</p> \n   <p>Now we know the truth, when Johnson says, \u2018get Brexit done\u2019, it\u2019s a fraud on the British people. This is the reality. Years of bogged down negotiations and our NHS is up for sale.</p> \n   <p>This election is now a fight for the survival of our National Health Service. As a public service free for all at the point of need.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And here are some of the specific points he made about what the documents show.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn said the documents showed that UK and US officials have discussed lengthening the time during which medicine patents apply.</strong> He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In fact, negotiations have advanced even further than we feared they had. The US and UK have already finished initial discussion on lengthening patents for medicines.</p> \n   <p>Longer patents mean only one thing \u2013 more expensive drugs. Lives will be put at risk as a result of this.</p> \n   <p>Many out-of-patent medicines available cheaply here are vastly more expensive under patent law in the US.</p> \n   <p>The drug Humira for Crohn\u2019s disease and rheumatoid arthritis costs our NHS \u00a31,409 a packet. In the US, the same packet costs \u00a38,115. Get the difference \u2013 \u00a31,409 in our NHS, \u00a38,115 in the USA.</p> \n   <p>One of the reasons for US drug prices being on average 250% of those here is a patent regime rigged for the big pharmaceutical companies ...</p> \n   <p>If you look at the readout of the second meeting, on page 51, UK officials report that \u201cpatent issues\u201d around \u201cNHS access to generic drugs will be a key consideration\u201d in talks.</p> \n   <p>US officials have \u201cpushed hard,\u201d the reports says, for longer patents for US drug companies.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn said the documents showed that the two sides were closer to a deal than people expected.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You can also see on page 132 of the report of the fourth meeting, where drug patents are being discussed, that officials are ready to \u201cexchange text\u201d which is trade-negotiator-speak for it being at a very advanced stage. And they say they are ready to, I quote, \u201creally take significant further steps.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the documents showed the US wanted \u201ctotal market access\u201d in a trade deal - implying health would be included.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The new breed of trade deals are not only \u2013 or even mainly \u2013 about tariffs on goods at the border.</p> \n   <p>They are also about services \u2013 including our health service.</p> \n   <p>And these documents make clear that for the US, to quote page 41 of the third meeting report, \u201ceverything is included unless something is specifically excluded.\u201d</p> \n   <p>They want, I quote: \u201cTotal market access\u201d as the \u201cbaseline assumption of the trade negotiations.\u201d</p> \n   <p>\u201cTotal market access.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Corbyn also said there was no evidence in the documents that the UK had pushed back against this. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>But surely you can\u2019t believe that British officials would demand the NHS be excluded? Apparently not.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the documents showed that British officials said they would be a \u201cliberalising influence\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In fact, on behalf of the Conservative government, officials reassured their counterparts that \u201cthe US should expect the UK to be a liberalising influence\u201d and that together they could \u201cfly the good flag for services liberalisation.\u201d</p> \n   <p>That\u2019s a green light for breaking open Britain\u2019s public services so corporations can profit from.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is not surprising because the Tories have always said they would like free trade deals to cover services as well as good.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the documents showed that a UK-US trade deal could provide protections for corporations, allowing them to sue governments in some circumstances for losses suffered.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Officials have discussed a system to give corporations the power to sue our country. This is not only a plot against our NHS. It is a plot against the whole country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Again, this is not surprising. Provisions like this were included in the proposed US-EU trade deal. My colleague <strong>George Monbiot </strong>was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/13/ttip-trade-deal-transatlantic-trade-investment-treaty\"> one of those most critical of these provisions, </a>but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/18/wrong-george-monbiot-nothing-secret-eu-trade-deal\">trade experts have defended them.</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn said the documents showed the Americans were offering to help the British persuade the public to accept the merits of chlorinated chicken. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>How about chlorine-washed chicken on our dinner tables?</p> \n   <p>Have a look at the second meeting, on page 42 and 43, where the US even agrees to share its \u201cpublic lines\u201d to help our government with its \u201cmedia narratives.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the documents showed the US favoured a no-deal Brexit.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You might want to look at ... page one of meeting six for the US advocating a no-deal Brexit saying that would mean there\u2019d be \u201call to play for\u201d in a deal with Trump.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bd2aa6e9475668cbfafaacc03f13ac872536bec\"> \n   <img

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us for this evening. Thanks for reading and commenting. As ever, my colleague Andrew Sparrow has put together a detailed summary of the day\u2019s events: Since he wrote it, a poll predicted that \u2013 were the election held today \u2013 the Tories could be on course for a significant Commons majority. The YouGov poll for the Times projected a possible 68-seat majority for the Conservatives, though it comes with significant caveats and with two weeks of campaigning still ahead. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Jamie Grierson, Denis Campbell and Frances Perraudin have tonight\u2019s man story: Some significantly more minor, though still interesting, points from this evening\u2019s poll: YouGov says few \u201cbig beasts\u201d would be likely to lose their seats if the vote were held today. But it identifies the Conservative MP, Zac Goldsmith, as being in particular danger, as well as the shadow environment secretary, Sue Hayman, and the shadow Scotland secretary, Lesley Laird. While the poll suggests Boris Johnson could comfortably retain his seat if the election were held right now, the margin of error identified by YouGov allows for an extremely narrow Labour victory in the same scenario. It suggests similar of other cabinet ministers, including the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, and the Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, as well as the international development secretary, Alok Sharma. None of them is predicted to be in any serious danger. Like Johnson, YouGov rates each of them as \u201clikely\u201d to hold their seat. But, were the results out by the most extreme margins of error YouGov has allowed for, election night could be less comfortable than each would hope. The poll predicts that the environment secretary, Theresa Villers, could have an even greater fight on her hands, were the vote held right now. YouGov projects the race in her constituency to be one of the closest, rating it a \u201ctossup\u201d. The result of YouGov\u2019s constituency by constituency model makes seductive reading for the Conservatives and grim reading for Labour. Can you believe it? What YouGov has in its favour was its success last time: Nine days before the last election, the firm predicted Theresa May\u2019s Conservatives would lose their majority and end up with just 310 seats. In fact, the party got 317 but it came at a time when few other pollsters were predicting anything other than a May win. What YouGov has against it is that it has been polling people over the past week, when regular polling firms would aim for the last couple of days. And, during an election campaign, every day matters. A week ago, neither party manifesto was out, the leaders debate hadn\u2019t happened and the antisemitism row hadn\u2019t surfaced. More importantly, while the Conservative squeeze of the Brexit party has come early in this campaign, the Labour squeeze of the Lib Dems is perhaps not yet complete. There are some things in the forecast that look curious. Labour is not forecast to gain any seats at all, which will surprise party workers in some targets where it has dozens on the ground, such as Southampton Itchen (Con maj 31), Hastings and Rye (Con maj 346) and Chingford and Woodford Green (Con maj 2438). But it will hit home in the critical \u201cred wall\u201d band that runs very roughly from north Wales to the Humber, where Labour insiders are already deeply concerned, with some party workers reporting a sharp fall in those willing to say they will back the party. The modelling suggests the Conservatives will gain seat after seat in Britain\u2019s smaller cities and large towns: Wrexham (Lab maj 1,832), Derby North (Lab maj 2,015), Great Grimsby (2,565), despite the residual presence of the Brexit party. Even West Bromwich East, previously held for Labour by Tom Watson with a majority of 7,713, is projected to change hands, and interestingly most of the seats projected to switch are straight Conservative versus Labour battles. In only a handful, such as Kensington in London, does a Lib Dem revival split the anti-Tory vote. Jeremy Corbyn is set to unveil more proposals in the Labour\u2019s \u201cGreen manifesto\u201d tomorrow, telling supporters at a packed rally in Cornwall this evening: \u201cI\u2019ll let you into little secret, it\u2019s brilliant\u201d. Speaking at the event in Falmouth to promote the party\u2019s \u201cGreen Industrial Revolution\u201d, the Labour leader said the 2016 Paris climate agreement did not go far enough. He told hundreds of cheering supporters: I want to lead a Labour government that next year will host the next climate change conference, and which will be much stronger than Paris. Our government will be one that will be very environmentally conscious, it will bring about a net zero emissions. Our government will work on the world stage to achieve that as well. Labour\u2019s \u201cGreen Industrial Revolution\u201d includes a 10-year Green transformation fund, costing \u00a325bn a year, and dedicated to renewable and low carbon energy, transport, biodiversity, and environmental restoration. It promises to create 1m green jobs in the energy sector and through nationwide home refurbishments. The idea is to tackle climate change while creating jobs through insulation upgrades, offshore wind and carbon capture. The jobs will also come from hydrogen and tidal energy expansion, port infrastructure, tree-planting, flood defences and plastics recycling. With just two weeks until the election, Corbyn warned supporters: Everything is going to be thrown at us in the next two weeks. Every bit of abuse that the right wing press can find. Every bit of abuse that the wealthiest in our society can throw at people that want to bring about real change. Chris Curtis, YouGov\u2019s political research manager, said the pollster\u2019s election MRP model suggests the Tories\u2019 projected gains could come at the expense of Labour in northern England and the Midlands. As expected, the key thing deciding the extent to which each of these seats is moving against Labour are how that seat voted in the European Union referendum. In the seats that voted most strongly to Leave in 2016 (60% or more in favour of departing the EU), the swing to the Conservatives is over 6%. This is allowing the Tories to overturn quite substantial majorities in places like West Bromwich East, the seat held until recently by Tom Watson, and Don Valley, the seat currently held by Caroline Flint. The only silver lining for Labour is that there are still 30 seats where it is currently 5% or less behind the Tories. If it can manage to squeeze the gap over the coming fortnight it may be able to paste over the cracks in their so-called red wall. But, with just two weeks to go, time is running out for Labour. The Tories could be on track for a majority of 68 seats, according to one poll published this evening. The YouGov poll for the Times suggests that, were the election to be held right now, the Conservatives could win 359 seats, against 211 for Labour, 43 for the SNP 43 and 13 for the Lib Dems 13. Those results would see the Tories up 42 seats on 2017 and Labour down 51. The paper reports that the seat-by-seat analysis was based on more than 100,000 interviews conducted over seven days and produced using a polling model that accurately predicted the outcome of the 2017 election. However, the Times reports, at least 30 seats have relatively small projected margins of victory for the Conservatives. And the pollster warned that a relatively small fall in Tory support could deny the party\u2019s suggested majority. There are also two weeks of campaigning to go. The prime minister has faced an awkward encounter with a group of nurses in Cornwall as they grilled him over his promise to boost NHS nursing numbers: Having stood down at the dissolution of parliament, Dominic Cummings was briefly reinstated to help the prime minister on the government\u2019s response to the flooding that hit the Midlands and northern England earlier this month. The Cabinet Office revealed the move to the Lib Dems\u2019 Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, in a letter dated Friday 22 November. Brake had written to the Cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, seeking clarification on Cummings\u2019s status, citing \u201cmedia reports Dominic Cummings has been in more regular communication with campaign staff over the last week\u201d. The Cabinet Office\u2019s response read: As with the significant majority of special advisers, Mr Cummings resigned from his role following the dissolution of parliament. During the government\u2019s response to flooding, some special advisers, including Mr Cummings, were reinstated on a temporary basis to provide support to the prime minister and he and others have since left. This is routine practice in such circumstances. A number of other special advisers have, in line with the code of conduct for special advisers and with the agreement of the prime minister, remained in their roles, for example, where there is an ongoing need for their support in government work. As set out in paragraph 18 of the code of conduct for special advisers, however, those who remain in post to work on government business must ensure that they do not use official resources for party political purposes and that any participation in the campaign is in a special adviser\u2019s own time and outside office hours. All special advisers are aware of the requirements in the code of conduct. Jeremy Corbyn has again stopped short of apologising to the UK\u2019s Jewish community for antisemitism within Labour\u2019s ranks. Asked by the Press Association if he would apologise for such incidents, as well as his handling of the issue, the Labour leader said: The degree of antisemitic activity in the Labour party is very, very small. Anybody committing antisemitic acts is breaking party rules and they are appropriately disciplined and sanctioned. All those rules came in since I became leader and indeed the latest regulations came specifically on my own request. Jennie Formby, our general secretary, has written a substantial article in the Jewish News today making clear the party deeply regrets and is very sorry for what happened before the new rules came in and obviously I support everything that she has said on that. Pressed on whether that was as good as a personal apology, Corbyn said: I have spent my life fighting racism in every conceivable form in our society. I don\u2019t want anyone to go through the hurt that Jewish women went through on the trains a few weeks ago, that Muslim women go through on our streets. I have made it very clear that our party will not tolerate racism in any form or antisemitism in any form and our party obviously deplores it and regrets what happened to those people who received that abuse and they have received the appropriate sanctions within the party, some of whom have been expelled. The prime minister\u2019s senior aide, Dominic Cummings, has resigned as a special adviser, according to a Cabinet Office source. Cummings, who was a senior figure in the Vote Leave campaign before starting as an adviser to Boris Johnson in July. His appointment at No 10 came only four months after he was found in contempt of parliament for refusing to appear before MPs investigating false news stories during the EU referendum campaign. Earlier today, he published a blog post warning pro-Brexit voters that a Conservative victory is not yet in the bag (see 5.16pm). Responding to a query about whether or not the publication of the post constituted a breach of the general election purdah rules imposed on special advisers, a Cabinet Office source confirmed Cummings had \u201cresigned following the dissolution of parliament ... along with the majority of special advisers\u201d, on 6 November. While his resignation is understood to be a formality, it had been reported that Cummings intended to stay on as Johnson\u2019s adviser, with the Tory election campaign being run by Isaac Levido. It is unclear what role, if any, Cummings will play if Johnson is returned to Downing Street after the election. Boris Johnson is \u201cscared\u201d of facing up to an interview with Andrew Neil, Labour has claimed, after its own leader\u2019s bruising encounter with the BBC journalist on Tuesday. The broadcaster clarified earlier today that it had not secured an agreement with the prime minister for him to take part in its series of interviews with party leaders, as many had expected (see: 3.37pm) he would. Ian Lavery, the Labour chair, has said: Boris Johnson backed out of a head-to-head debate with Jeremy Corbyn on Sunday, he is refusing to take part in the party leaders\u2019 climate crisis debate tomorrow and now this. He\u2019s running scared because every time he is confronted with the impact of nine years of austerity, the cost of living crisis and over his plans to sell out our NHS, the more he is exposed. A Labour source has indicated this evening that the party was led to believe Johnson was to face Neil next week. Jeremy Corbyn has sought to firm up the credibility of one of Labour\u2019s most potent attack lines against the Conservatives by releasing a 451-page dossier giving details of what has been discussed in preliminary talks on a UK-US trade deal. At a dramatic press conference in London, where journalists were presented with copies of the document without warning, Corbyn said this was the evidence that left Boris Johnson\u2019s claim the NHS was not under threat from a Trump trade deal \u201cin tatters\u201d. Corbyn explained: We\u2019ve now got evidence that under Boris Johnson the NHS is on the table and will be up for sale. He tried to cover it up in a secret agenda but today it\u2019s been exposed. Labour campaigners say the claim that a Tory Brexit would pose a threat to the NHS is one that resonates with voters and, with the polls suggesting that Johnson\u2019s double-digit lead is holding up, Corbyn will have been hoping that this would be the bombshell that might (in the jargon) \u201cmove the dial\u201d. Eight hours later, now that journalists have had time to study the contents of the documents (which it turns out were leaked and published in an obscure corner of the internet some weeks ago), it turns out that the material is not quite as incriminating as Corbyn implied. The documents, which set out what has been said in talks between UK and US officials over the last two years scoping out the parameters for a trade deal, do not show that the government has agreed to anything that would let American corporations take over the NHS, or that would result in the NHS having to pay higher prices for drugs. But what the documents do confirm is that the Americans do have ambitions in these areas and that, despite ministers claiming that the NHS is \u201cnot on the table\u201d, the healthcare sector has been discussed (albeit not extensively) in these preliminary trade talks. Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, accused Corbyn of lying about the document. In a statement she said: Jeremy Corbyn is getting desperate and is out-and-out lying to the public about what these documents contain. He has always believed in conspiracy theories \u2013 which is why he has failed to crack down on the scourge of antisemitism in his party. This is the man that has caused huge offence by blaming an imaginary \u2018Zionist lobby\u2019 for society\u2019s ills and now he has decided to smear UK officials too. It is telling that Truss, and Johnson himself in his own response, seemed anxious to turn change the subject as quickly as possible (to antisemitism and Brexit respectively) and that strongly suggests that the Conservatives realise this is damaging, regardless of whether or not Corbyn may have over-sold the contents of his dossier. That is because in the end what would be decided in a UK-US trade deal would depend on the political dynamics at the end of the talks (not on anything in this 451-page bundle) and any judgement that voters make at this point will be a matter of trust. Any government would think twice before signing a trade deal that would imperil the NHS, because that would be politically toxic. But voters who keep hearing Johnson say that he would not put the NHS on the table in a trade deal may remember that he also made assurances to the DUP about not accepting a customs border down the Irish Sea that he merrily abandoned 12 months later. If ultimately this is a matter of trust, Johnson and the Tories are vulnerable. Boris Johnson has apologised for Islamophobia within the Conservative party as a Tory candidate accused the prime minister of fanning the flames of anti-Muslim prejudice. Johnson is willing to apologise for the actions of others in this regard. However, as viewers of Question Time witnessed on Friday, he is not so keen to apologise for what he has done himself. Nicola Sturgeon will put ending austerity, the removal of nuclear weapons from Scotland and a second independence referendum in 2020 at the heart of her party\u2019s post-election negotiations with Labour if there is a hung parliament. The BBC has revealed that Boris Johnson has yet to agree a date for an interview with Andrew Neil, prompting speculation that he might try to get through the campaign without submitting himself to scrutiny from the most aggressive and formidable interviewer on TV. Tory sources will just say discussions about a date are \u201congoing\u201d. Sadly, if Johnson were to duck the Neil challenge, that would be a constitutional outrage that even the supreme court couldn\u2019t overturn. Jim O\u2019Neill, a former Conservative minister who was one of the key architects of the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d, has questioned whether either of the main parties are genuinely committed to devolving powers out of Whitehall. Boris Johnson\u2019s admiration for Donald Trump will lead to workers\u2019 rights being ripped up if the Conservatives win the general election next month, the leader of Britain\u2019s trade unionists has warned. Labour\u2019s Richard Burgon has said his party is committed to paying \u00a358bn in compensation to the Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) women because they were the victims of \u201ctheft\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn has said that he can guarantee he will protect public libraries if Labour gets into power. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is writing the blog now. The latest edition of the Guardian\u2019s Politics Weekly podcast has gone out. You can listen here: This week, Heather Stewart is joined by Polly Mackenzie, James Morris, and Andrew Gimson. Plus: Kate Proctor calls in from the Labour campaign trail and Peter Walker explains why the Lib Dem campaign is struggling. Factcheck Claim: Nicola Sturgeon has said a key SNP demand in any post-election coalition talks with Labour is that the next UK government must raise NHS spending in England to Scottish levels, which are currently \u00a3136 a head higher. The SNP says that would mean \u00a335bn extra in day to day NHS spending in England by 2023/24 compared to this year \u2013 more than any other party proposes. Background: Every party boasts it will increase NHS spending but this is an audacious policy. Health policy in Scotland is totally devolved to Holyrood and the SNP has no remit over the NHS in England. Historically, Scotland has spent more on health than the rest of the UK because it has a far more dispersed rural population, many islands to service and higher rates of ill-health. Sturgeon argues this extra English spending is justified to rectify the impacts of past austerity policies and, because Scottish funding is derived in part by how much is spent on the NHS in England, her government will get \u00a34bn more from the Treasury in 2023/24. Reality: Ben Zaranko, an analyst at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says Labour plans to raise day to day NHS spending in England by \u00a331.2bn by 2023/24; the Tories by \u00a328.6bn and the Lib Dems by \u00a330.5bn. The SNP claims its plans would mean total English day-to-day NHS spending of \u00a3159.2bn in 2023/24. The IFS has different calculations. It says that Labour plans means the English NHS will have \u00a3154.9bn to spend in 2023/24 compared to \u00a3158.7bn under the SNP\u2019s plans. That \u00a33.8bn is a relatively small increase of 2.45%. Verdict: Sturgeon is right that the SNP\u2019s proposals means higher NHS spending than the other parties propose. But the effects are not as great as the headline figure suggests and by 2023/24, NHS spending targets are almost certain to change as time goes on. There have been a lot of polls now suggesting the Conservatives are on course for at least a decent majority. This is not necessarily helpful - if supporters think victory is in the bag, they might not turn out - and that probably explains why Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s most influential policy adviser, has written a post on his blog with advice to Vote Leave reporters. Here is the key extract. You will see many polls in the coming days. Some will say Boris will win. Trust me, as someone who has worked on lots of campaigns, things are much tighter than they seem and there is a very real possibility of a hung parliament. Without a majority, the nightmare continues. All other MPs will gang together to stop Brexit and give EU citizens the vote. It\u2019s that simple. Talking of MRP models (see 4.05pm), Best for Britain, the anti-Brexit group, has also commissioned its own MRP analysis, from Focaldata, and it suggests that the Conservatives could be on course for a majority of more than 80. But Best for Britain is using the data to encourage tactical voting and it says that if 117,314 or more pro-EU voters were to vote tactically, then the Tories could be denied a majority. Here is an extract from the Best for Britain news release. Our data predicts that the Conservatives could win up to 366 seats, having been boosted by roughly three-quarters of the Brexit party\u2019s vote share where the Brexit party have not fielded a candidate. Under this scenario, Labour would win 199 seats, Lib Dems would win 17 seats, SNP would win 44 seats, Plaid would win 4 seats and the Greens would win 1 seat. A result like this would translate into a majority of around 82. The press notice goes on: However, if 4,000 or less pro-EU voters use their vote tactically in Best for Britain\u2019s 57 target seats, the Conservatives would be reduced to 309 seats \u2013 a dozen short of a majority. Labour would win 244 seats, SNP would win 52 seats, Lib Dems would win 21 seats, Plaid would win 4 seats and the Greens would win 1 seat ... Despite the boost received by the Conservatives from the Brexit party, there is still a substantial number of seats where tactical voting could be decisive. There are 165 seats where fewer than 5,000 tactical votes would be enough to prevent the Conservative party winning the seat (compared to 131 at the beginning of the election campaign). In 27 of these it would take fewer than 2,000 tactical votes. Best for Britain is encouraging people to vote tactically in accordance with the recommendations on its tactical voting website. However, as I reported in a post on Monday, there are at least four other tactical voting websites which in some cases make different recommendations. The National Education Union - the merged NUT and ATL teachers\u2019 unions - has released polling it commissioned of 1,000 voters with school-aged children in England, showing that 38% of parents plan to back Labour, compared with 33% for the Conservatives, 11% for Lib Dems, 9% for the Brexit party, and 4% for the Green party (excluding don\u2019t knows). The polling breakdown showed a sharp division by age: 41% of those aged 18-34 backed Labour but just 27% of those aged 35-54. While only 15% of the younger group would vote Tory, support doubled to 30% among the older group. The polling was carried out by Deltapoll last week as the parties unveiled their manifestos and education pledges. The NHS was named as an important election issue by 55% while education was mentioned by 28%, close to the 29% who named Brexit as a key issue. Some 54% of parents agreed funding for their local schools was insufficient. Mary Bousted, the NEU\u2019s joint general secretary, said: This election is about much more than Brexit, as demonstrated by this poll of parents. Education is cutting through, with parents now ranking it almost as important as Brexit. The poll showed one surprising result: Labour was the most popular party among parents with children at private schools, despite its manifesto policy of adding VAT to school fees. Some 42% backed Labour while 30% backed the Tories, although the poll appears to significantly over-represent the proportion of parents with children at private schools. Charles Clarke, who was home secretary when Tony Blair was prime minister, told Emma Barnett on Radio 5 Live earlier that, if there were a hung parliament, Labour could ditch Jeremy Corbyn as leader. He explained: There are only two alternative outcomes of this election \u2013 one is a Conservative overall majority which for various reasons I think would be disastrous for the country, and the other would be a hung parliament in which you have to construct a government between Labour, the SNP, the Lib Dems, whoever is involved in that hung parliament. And as one of Labour\u2019s current advisors Bob Kerslake said the other day, in such a negotiation about a hung parliament, not only the policy programmes and so on are up for discussion, as they are in any such debate, but also the personnel issues \u2013 the leadership of the government, the prime minister and the key offices of government too. I believe the Liberal Democrats and the DUP have been very clear they couldn\u2019t accept Jeremy Corbyn as the leader of a hung parliament. Clarke also said he thought Corbyn\u2019s refusal to apologise to the Jewish community in last night\u2019s interview with Andrew Neil was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. These are from the Financial Times\u2019 Sebastian Payne The Scottish Conservatives have suspended their general election candidate for Glasgow Central following complaints about Islamophobic language. Flora Scarabello will have support for her campaign withdrawn, following the submission of a complaint to the party\u2019s central office about the alleged use of \u201canti-Muslim language\u201d. It is being reported that the details emerged in a private phone call, which was recorded and sent to party officials. While the complaint is being investigated, Scarabello will have her party membership suspended. The deadline for removing her as a general election candidate has passed, meaning there is no option but for her name to still appear on the ballot paper. A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: We take allegations like this extremely seriously. There is no place in the Scottish Conservatives for anti-Muslim language, or any other form of racial or religious discrimination. As such, we have immediately suspended the candidate and the complaint will be thoroughly investigated. Alison Thewliss won Glasgow Central for the SNP in 2017, with a 2,267 majority over Labour. The Tories were a long way behind in third place. Jeremy Corbyn has posted this from the train taking him to Cornwall for an election rally tonight. From the LBC\u2019s Theo Usherwood More from my colleague Peter Walker on Michael Heseltine\u2019s speech. Here is the latest election polling from YouGov. As usual, it is worth stressing that conventional polling badly underestimated the Labour vote at the 2017 election. But there was one polling exercise that did very well two years ago. YouGov produced a model for the election using multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP), a technique that involves trying to work out how Britain will vote on a constituency by constituency basis, using data about the demographic composition of each constituency and polling information about how particular demographics are likely to vote. The model predicted a hung parliament. When it was published, in the middle of the 2017 campaign, this was seen as so unlikely that it was widely dismissed, but it turned out to be the best polling guide to the final result. We will find out what the YouGov MRP model is saying about the 2019 result tonight, when the figures are published in the Times. Michael Heseltine, the former Conservative deputy prime minister and pro-European who is backing the Liberal Democrats at this election, is speaking now at a Lib Dem event, my colleague Peter Walker reports. Nick Dearden, director of the campaigning group Global Justice Now, has written an article for Open Democracy about what we\u2019e learned from the leaked dossier about the UK-US trade talks. Here\u2019s an excerpt. The papers show US officials pushing Britain to an ever-harder Brexit position, clear that they don\u2019t want Britain to be a \u201csatellite of the EU\u201d in the way Switzerland is. They even threaten that if the UK continued to push certain EU positions in international forums \u2013 something the UK is still bound to do \u2013 it could undermine negotiations on a US trade deal. Papers from the time of Theresa May\u2019s \u2018Chequers plan\u2019 are illuminating because the administration is clearly furious at May\u2019s promise of long-term alignment with EU standards, which would prevent the dilution of British food regulations which US agribusiness hopes to benefit from. US negotiators saw this as a \u201cworst case scenario\u201d and threatened to raise it with Trump ahead of his UK visit. One of the most significant changes which Johnson made to May\u2019s Brexit deal was a weakening of the alignment to EU standards, suggesting US bullying worked. But it\u2019s particularly worrying that economic modelling seen by the trade officials showed this was likely to be good for the US, but much less so for \u201cUK welfare and GDP gains\u201d. And here is the line-up for the BBC seven-party debate on Friday night. We knew that Boris Johnson would not be turning up. But Jeremy Corbyn and Nigel Farage are also giving it a miss too, and so it does not really count as a leaders\u2019 debate. (Caroline Lucas isn\u2019t a party leader either, but she is an ex-leader, and arguably she has a higher profile than the two Green co-leaders, S\u00eean Berry and Jonathan Bartley.) The BBC has said that Boris Johnson has yet to agree a date for an interview with Andrew Neil, as part of the leader interviews series that Neil is doing. It is not hard to guess why Johnson\u2019s team might be having second thoughts. Neil is the most aggressive and forensic interviewer on TV, and Nicola Sturgeon and Jeremy Corbyn were both left looking diminished after their encounters with him this week. Is it conceivable that Johnson might just refuse point-blank to show up? In a healthy political culture, that would be unthinkable. But sadly there is no law yet saying someone cannot be appointed PM without having given a lengthy interview to Andrew Neil, and Johnson did try to suspend parliament for five weeks for his own political convenience. So it doesn\u2019t seem impossible that he might pull out entirely ... Obviousl From the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley This is what Boris Johnson said in the Q&amp;A about the leaked dossier about the UK-US trade talks. It is a total nonsense, and it is endlessly repeated by the Labour party, that the NHS is somehow up for sale, or going to be negotiated in a trade deal. Nothing could be further from the truth. That will not happen under this government or any Conservative government. What you have heard from me today is our commitment to the NHS. And there\u2019s only one reason why the Labour party continues bring this up, which is a total invention. It is because they seek to distract from the great void at the heart of their principle policy at this election, which is about Brexit. Q: You say the Labour allegations about the NHS and a UK-US trade deal are nonsense. So why was the NHS being discussed at all? Johnson says it is nonsense to say the NHS would be part of a trade deal. He says Labour is trying to distract attention from the problems with its Brexit policy. He says Labour is showing a vacuum of leadership on antisemitism and on Brexit. That\u2019s it. The event is over. A questioner says hello to Johnson in Cornish. He replies with a word of what sounds like Cornish \u2013 to applause from the audience. Q: Cornwall council has lost \u00a3370m since 2010. Is it right, then, to be putting \u00a32bn into a pot hole fund? Johnson says he thinks some of that pot hole money will go to councils. Q: Are you sorry for the state of the NHS in Cornwall? Johnson says he has seen the pressure the NHS is under. People do an incredible job, but they are under huge pressure. He says Truro is getting a new maternity unit. He says Labour\u2019s plan for a four-day week would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the management of all public services, including the NHS. Boris Johnson is now taking questions. Q: You said you would fix the crisis in social care when you became PM. But there is not much detail about this in your manifesto. Don\u2019t you think voters deserve a bit more detail? Johnson says he visited a hospital this morning, and heard about the pressures on the social care system. He says the government has put \u00a31.5bn into the system to meet immediate needs. There will be another \u00a31bn a year for the life of this parliament. And he says he wants to establish cross-party consensus on this. It should be based on two principles: dignity for people in old age, and no one having to sell their home to pay for care. Johnson says his party backs his Brexit deal. He goes on: There has never been such an outbreak of harmony in the Conservative party. That gets a round of applause. Johnson jokes about Michel Barnier asking Jeremy Corbyn whether anyone in Labour would back the Brexit deal that Corbyn proposes to negotiate with the EU. Johnson says Jeremy Corbyn made it clear in his Andrew Neil interview yesterday that taxation would go up for everone. He also claims that, under Labour, the UK\u2019s credit rating would go down. As a result borrowing would cost more, he says. Johnson says the Tories see a \u201cbalance and a symmetry\u201d between having fantastic public services and having a market economy. The Tories are the only party in that believes in the market economy, he says. Johnson refers to his photocall at Goonhilly Earth Station earlier today. He jokes about wondering whether those satellite dishes could detect the missing element in Labour\u2019s Brexit policy - ie, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s stance. (Actually, there isn\u2019t a mystery about Corbyn\u2019s stance any more. He has confirmed he would be neutral.) Boris Johnson is speaking now. He says it is great to be in Cornwall. He went for a run on the beach in St Ives this morning, he says. He is now on to the standard stump speech \u2013 starting with why there must be an election, to get Brexit done etc etc. Boris Johnson is doing a campaign event in Cornwall. There will be a live feed at the top of the blog shortly. These are from David Henig, a former UK civil servant specialising in trade policy who now runs the UK trade policy project for the European Centre for International Political Economy thinktank, on the leaked dossier about the UK-US trade talks. These are from some journalists who have had a chance to look at the leaked documents about UK-US trade talks released by Labour this morning. Generally, they think they are not quite as incriminating as Jeremy Corbyn implied. From Sky\u2019s Ed Conway From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam From the Independent\u2019s Benjamin Kentish This is what Boris Johnson said in response to the Labour claims about the leaked documents from the UK-US trade deal talks. He said: The NHS is in no way on the table [in trade talks with the US], in no aspect whatever. This is continually brought up by the Labour party as a diversionary tactic from the difficulties they are encountering, particularly the problem about leadership on antisemitism, and then the great vacuity about their policy on Brexit. Next up will be the Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh. He will be answering any questions you may have about polling at 12.30pm on Friday. You can ask your question via our form here. Boris Johnson has apologised for the \u201churt and offence\u201d that has been caused by Islamophobia within the Conservative party ranks. Speaking on a campaign visit in Cornwall, Johnson said: Obviously whenever we have an incident of antisemitism or Islamophobia or whatever in the Conservative party we take a zero tolerance approach ... We have a one bounce and we deal with it approach to this. We are going to have an independent inquiry into Islamophobia, antisemitism, every manner of prejudice and discrimination and it will start before Christmas. Asked whether he apologised for the Islamophobia that has taken place in the Tory party, he replied: Of course and for all the hurt and offence that has been caused \u2013 of course we do. And all that is intolerable and it\u2019s so important as a country that we don\u2019t allow that kind of thing and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to have the independent inquiry. Johnson\u2019s decision to apologise may have been intended to mark a contrast with Jeremy Corbyn, who refused to for his handling of antisemitism in the Labour party in his Andrew Neil interview last night - even though he had apologised about it in the past. (See 7.43am.) But there is also a contrast with the approach taken by Johnson himself in the BBC Question Time debate on Friday last week. Johnson was asked to apologise for a column he wrote last year describing Muslim women wearing burqas as looking like letterboxes. This was condemned as Islamophobic, and blamed for a 375% rise in incidents of Islamophobia, but Johnson refused to apologise. Q: Just how radical is the Labour party manifesto \u2013 when compared to both traditional British politics, and to other European countries? Tom Bacon, freelance journalist in the entertainment sector, Ormskirk Hi Tom. So Jeremy Corbyn was right when he told my colleague Kate Proctor earlier this week that his plans wouldn\u2019t put the UK significantly out of line with other European countries, in terms of tax and spending and the size of the state. But it\u2019s the speed of the transformation that is so striking: the manifesto envisages a radical transformation of the economy and the role of government, in just five years. As director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies Paul Johnson put it, \u201cthis would be the biggest set of spending increases, and the biggest set of tax increases, and the biggest set of borrowing increases we\u2019ve seen in peacetime history\u201d. Q: What does the nationalisation of Openreach mean for the thousands of people currently working for Openreach\u2019s competitors? There seems to have been no mention of this, with the implication being that given there will be no need for competitors of British Broadband, that their job losses will be the price to pay for \u2018free\u2019 broadband. Sam, West Midlands Good question, Sam. My colleague Peter Walker actually asked about the fate of those companies at the launch event for the broadband policy. The answer he was given was that they could continue to provide add-on services, such as subscription TV packages. But you\u2019re right, the expectation would be that their broadband operations would wither away (while BT Openreach \u2013 renamed British Broadband \u2013 would expand its operations significantly, presumably). Q: I\u2019m aware that Labour are planning to decriminalise abortion \u2013 which I am wholly supportive of. However, I\u2019m not clear on whether this also changes the law on the latest a woman can legally terminate? Many Tory supporters I know are posting pro-life website claims that abortion will be made legal at any point during pregnancy even when the baby is fully developed. I do not believe this to be true but struggling to find the details on the changes labour intend to make to abortion law and would like clarification. Nicole, Hertfordshire Hi Nicole. I\u2019m really interested (and concerned) to hear that that\u2019s out there, because it\u2019s not true. The only reference to abortion policy in the manifesto says: \u201cWe will uphold women\u2019s reproductive rights and decriminalise abortions.\u201d There is no reference to any plan to review the current policy. Thanks for asking that one. Just under 15 minutes left to ask any questions you may have on the Labour manifesto. Send them in to us here. Q: I have teenage grandchildren, one hoping to start higher education next year. Please can you clarify the Labour position on student grants \u2013 both for maintenance and tuition fees. Will there be means testing? If Labour takes over government after the election when would any new arrangements for student finances be introduced? Muriel, Preston Hello Muriel. Labour has said it will abolish tuition fees for all students \u2013 beginning immediately, so for those starting university in autumn 2020 \u2013 and bring back maintenance grants for the children of families on lower incomes. Q: Have Labour published any deeper details on what the \u00a31bn public health investment might break down into? Health inequalities presumably need to be a focus. Joel, 30, working in the charity sector, Essex Hi Joel. So yes: the manifesto says a Labour government would make reducing health inequalities a clear target of public policy. The \u00a31bn planned increase in public health funding is part of that, and they say they would recruit 4,500 more health visitors and school nurses \u2013 and take a series of other steps on everything from increasing breastfeeding support for new mums, to widening the scope of the sugar tax to tackle obesity. To try and make the target stick, they also say they would introduce a new Future Generations Wellbeing Act: a law aimed at forcing the government to check the impact of all new policy on health inequality; and a new obligation on NHS agencies to cooperate with directors of public health. Nicola Sturgeon has said the Scottish National party would have \u201cno great objection\u201d if Jeremy Corbyn was replaced as Labour leader, and hinted strongly she would support that if it helped form an anti-Tory coalition at Westminster. The SNP leader said she \u201cdidn\u2019t get to choose who leads the Labour party\u201d but repeated several times at the launch of her party\u2019s election manifesto she was no fan of Corbyn\u2019s. Asked whether the SNP would support replacing Corbyn as party leader if there were moves to do so at Westminster, to build a cross-party coalition with Labour, she said: I don\u2019t choose the leader of the Labour party. I have said if I did choose the leader of Labour party I wouldn\u2019t choose Jeremy Corbyn, so that probably gives you the answer to that question. If Labour wanted to change its leader, I wouldn\u2019t have any great objection to that [but] I\u2019m not in charge of that decision. The Labour adviser Lord Kerslake suggested earlier this week that Corbyn\u2019s resignation as leader and a deal on staging a second independence referendum could be the price exacted by the Lib Dems and SNP for forming a post-election coalition. Opinion polling suggests Labour is well short of winning enough seats to form a majority government, increasing speculation that Corbyn will have to strike deals with other opposition parties to block Boris Johnson from forming the next government. Even so, Corbyn has repeatedly ruled out any pacts or deals, rejecting Sturgeon\u2019s demands that he empower Holyrood to stage a fresh independence vote in late 2020. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has repeatedly stated her party would never do deals with a Corbyn-led government. At the SNP manifesto launch this morning, Sturgeon was asked by Channel 4 News about the attacks on Corbyn\u2019s suitability as prime minister by Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi, and whether that gave her pause for thought about propping up a minority Labour government. She replied: I deplore Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s lack of leadership on the issue of antisemitism and I don\u2019t condone in any way, shape or form that failure on the part of him and of the Labour party to eradicate that from their ranks. But she said the SNP would exercise its duties at Westminster responsibly, pressing for its policy goals to be adopted by the next UK government. \u201cWe will not be signing any blank cheque to Jeremy Corbyn or to any leader of the Labour party.\u201d Some of you have been sending in your questions about the Labour manifesto which I will be answering until 1.30pm. You can share your questions with us via our form here. Q: Labour has often hinted at electoral reform. Is there any commitment to scrapping the first past the post system for general elections? Daniel, 46, geologist, Leamington Spa I\u2019m afraid, not, Daniel. Labour\u2019s manifesto says it will \u201ctake urgent steps to refresh our democracy\u201d, and commits to a series of specific changes, including abolishing the hereditary principle in the House of Lords and lowering the voting age to 16; but there is no mention of voting reform. It does say the reboot of democracy will be guided by a UK-wide constitutional convention, led by a citizens\u2019 assembly. Its appears to be mainly focused on the balance of power between Westminster and the rest of the UK; but perhaps voting reform might emerge as a recommendation? That\u2019s as close as the manifesto comes to the issue. Q: Has Labour made any indication that they would have a gender balanced cabinet? Eric Ekong, 28, software engineer, London So I haven\u2019t seen Jeremy Corbyn make that commitment explicitly, Eric, but he has repeatedly highlighted the gender balance in his shadow cabinet, and contrasted that with the Conservatives\u2019 more male-dominated top team. So while he hasn\u2019t committed to keeping everyone in the same jobs if he got into Downing Street, I think it\u2019s highly likely he would maintain a balance. Here are the main points from the Conservative rebuttal released in response to the leaked UK-US trade talks dossier, and what Jeremy Corbyn was saying about it. (See 12.20pm.) The Tories claim Corbyn deliberately misrepresented what the documents say about the UK being willing to consider lengthening the time during which medicine patents apply. Corbyn argued that this meant drug prices could rise for the UK under a UK-US trade deal. (See 11.37am.) But the Tories accuse Corbyn of lying. They say: In his press conference, Jeremy Corbyn highlighted the following quote: \u2018The impact of some patent issues raised on NHS access to generic drugs (i.e. cheaper drugs) will be a key consideration going forward\u2019 (13-14 November 2017, p.51) and suggested that this meant that the Government would allow drug prices to rise. This is a lie. Corbyn has quoted this section out of context. This was officials flagging a potential issue that the UK has to avoid in the future trade talks. The conversation that the paper reports on was a preliminary conversation in which the \u2018US focus was on explaining their legislation and approach in FTAs [free trade agreements]\u2019. The paper also notes that there was only a \u2018limited discussion on pharmaceutical protection\u2019. The reason this was only a limited conversation was \u2018given sensitivities in this area related to the NAFTA negotiations\u2019 (13-14 November 2017, p.44). The Tories say the documents show the Americans accept that the UK does not want to include the NHS in a deal. They say (bold in original): The notes make clear that, at the very start of the discussions, that the US team are aware that the UK won\u2019t accept any attempt to put the NHS on the table: \u2018Nursing was the other profession that the US was interested in... The US were interested to know if it would be really problematic for the UK to act in this area \u2013 they were sensitive to the particular sensitivities with the health sector in the UK.\u2019 (24-25 July 2017, p.24) Subsequent papers also state that \u2018we do not currently believe the US has a major offensive interest in this [health] space\u2019 (March 2018, p.53). The Tories say the documents show that, although the US \u201cprobed\u201d the UK position, the British stressed that they did not want to include the health service in a deal. They say (bold in original): The papers only show that USTR [US trade representative] \u2018probed UK position on our \u201chealth insurance\u201d system\u2019 (21-22 March 2018). The same document shows that the UK response made clear that \u2018Wouldn\u2019t want to discuss particular health care entities\u2026 we need to protect our needs; this would be something to discuss further down the line when we come to consider what entities would count as \u2018enterprises\u2019\u2019. This reflects our clear position that the NHS is not for sale and that any trade deal should only include commercial enterprises. The Tories say the government has not accepted a negative listing approach to services in a trade deal (ie, the assumption that services are included unless the deal says specifically that they are not). Corbyn implied the opposite at the news conference this morning. The Tories says Corbyn was wrong to say trade negotiations have reached an advance stage with the US because formally they have not started. The UK cannot negotiate trade deals while it remains a member of the EU. They say the documents have been online for two months. (My colleague Alex Hern has more on this at 12.28pm.) The Tories say that, under Labour\u2019s plan for a customs union with the EU, the UK could be bound by an EU-US trade deal over which it would have no say. Many of your questions so far have been about how Labour will pay for free education and how EU citizens will be affected by Brexit. Q: One of the most popular ideas in the Labour manifesto is free education for all. Where would the money to back up the abolition of tuition fees for undergraduate and postgraduate courses come from? And how would that affect the economy given the astronomical fees that students currently pay/get a loan from? Carina Nicu, 27 years old, research technician at the University of Manchester, Manchester Hi Carina, you\u2019re right that abolishing tuition fees and restoring maintenance grants is the single most costly measure in the manifesto, at \u00a313.6bn a year by the end of the parliament. Labour says almost half of that, \u00a36.4bn, will be offset by the savings from getting rid of the current system (it\u2019s costly to administer, and many students have their fees written off anyway). They would also argue that ensuring kids from lower-income households are not deterred from going to university would have wider social/economic benefits \u2013 though of course it wouldn\u2019t just be these students who would benefit. Labour haven\u2019t earmarked specific taxes to pay for each spending measure \u2013 but their biggest money-raiser is increasing corporation tax, which is expected to bring in a whopping \u00a323.7bn a year within five years. The impact of that on the wider economy is contested: Labour say they\u2019re just taking it back to 2010 levels, and the 26% rate still won\u2019t be high by international standards. Critics say it will deter foreign investment \u2013 and that part of the cost will ultimately be passed on to customers and workers, as well as wealthy executives and shareholders. Q: Are there any concrete measures for EU nationals living in the UK (in the context of Brexit) in the Labour manifesto? Sabrina Hi Sabrina. Yes: the Labour manifesto reiterates the party\u2019s longstanding commitment to uphold the rights of EU citizens already in the UK to remain here. And it goes a bit further, saying a Labour government would get rid of the legal requirement to register under the EU settlement scheme. It would instead become a \u201cdeclaratory system\u201d, under which EU citizens could register if they wished, but it wouldn\u2019t be a requirement for continuing to live and work here, the manifesto says. (It doesn\u2019t say how that would work for employers wondering if a particular individual has the right to be here). Labour would also expand the right of all migrants to bring their families to the UK. As for freedom of movement, that would depend on what happens with Brexit. I\u2019m Heather Stewart, political editor of the Guardian, and will be answering your questions about the Labour manifesto today. I covered economics at the Guardian and Observer for 15 years before transferring to Westminster in 2016 \u2013 initially in a job share with Anushka Asthana. Since then I have covered a referendum and now two general elections. If you have a question you can send it to us by filling in the form here. The 451-page cache of US/UK trade negotiations shared by Jeremy Corbyn was published before today \u2013 by an unknown whistleblower to the social news website Reddit. In a post titled \u201cOFFICIAL-SENSITIVE: Great Britain is practically standing on her knees working on a trade agreement with the US\u201d, the whistleblower shared a link to the documents, which they said \u201csometimes give the impression that the second side of the process is not Great Britain, but a third world country\u201d. But despite the poster\u2019s belief that \u201cthis publication will make some noise\u201d, the post attracted just a hundred or so \u201cupvotes\u201d, and 23 comments, in the month since it was made. The cache did slowly begin to be shared more widely, however, with Labour MEP Jude Kirton-Darling posting it on her Twitter account five days ago. Shortly before they posted the documents to Reddit, the original leaker, a user called gregoratior, set up a new subforum on the site: \u201cukwhistleblower\u201d. But the subforum has not yet had anything posted in it, and had just five members before the news broke today. The Conservatives have released a four-page statement rebutting what was said by Jeremy Corbyn at his news conference this morning about the documents he has obtained about the UK-US trade talks. I will post full details of what the Tory rebuttal says shortly, but the gist of it is that Corbyn has deliberately misrepresented what they say. In a statement Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, has also sought to link Corbyn\u2019s handling of this story to his approach to antisemitism. She said: Jeremy Corbyn is getting desperate and is out-and-out lying to the public about what these documents contain. He has always believed in conspiracy theories \u2013 which is why he has failed to crack down on the scourge of antisemitism in his party. This is the man that has caused huge offence by blaming an imaginary \u2018Zionist lobby\u2019 for society\u2019s ills and now he has decided to smear UK officials too. People should not believe a word that he says - this stunt is simply a smokescreen for the fact that he has no plan for Brexit and that he has been forced to admit that he wants to increase taxes for millions of families. As we have consistently made clear: the NHS will not be on the table in any future trade deal and the price that the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table. This sort of conspiracy theory fuelled nonsense is not befitting of the leader of a major political party. Truss was referring to this article when she talked about Corbyn using the phrase \u201cZionist lobby\u201d. The Guido Fawkes website has published what it says are full versions of the documents released by Labour today. The campaigning group Global Justice Now has welcomed the release of what it is describing as leaked documents. The organisation released the original, heavily redacted version of these papers that were obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. These were the papers Jeremy Corbyn was brandishing during the ITV debate last week. In a news release, Global Justice Now also offered its own summary of what these documents show. Here it is in full. The US pushing lower food standards on Britain post Brexit, including allowing imports of chlorine-washed chickens, less nutritional labelling on foods, and less protection for regional food like stilton cheese. The US offered to help the UK government \u2018sell\u2019 chlorine chicken to a sceptical British public and stated that parliamentary scrutiny of food standards is \u2018unhelpful\u2019. The US banning any mention of climate change in a US-UK trade deal. US officials threatening UK civil servants that they would undermine US trade talks if they supported certain EU positions in international forums. The US suggesting a \u2018corporate court system\u2019 in a US-UK deal, which would allow big business to sue the British government, in secret and without appeal, for anything they regard as \u2018unfair\u2019. Recent similar cases have included suing governments for trying to phase out use of coal. US officials pushing a far reaching proposals on the digital economy, giving big tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon sweeping freedoms to move and use our online data, which would make taxation and regulation of these companies more difficult and prohibit Labour proposals for a public broadband service. Threats to public services like the NHS, via sweeping services liberalisation. The British government would need to exclude everything not subject to liberalisation in order to protect public services, while bringing formerly public services like the mail, or rail companies back into public ownership would be much harder. US officials making a further threat to NHS in terms of medicine pricing policy, with special concern about Brits paying more for cancer medicines which the US feels Britain doesn\u2019t pay enough for. Trade negotiators have received special lobbying from pharmaceutical corporations as part of the trade talks. US officials demanding US experts and multinational corporations are able to participate in standard-setting in Britain post Brexit. A promise by both sides to keep talks secret from the public. As part of a new series you can ask our political team any questions you have about the general election, and they will post their responses on the politics live blog between 12.30pm and 1.30pm every Monday, Wednesday and Friday until polling week. Today, the Guardian\u2019s political editor, Heather Stewart, will answer your questions about the Labour manifesto, campaign and policies, just how realistic the pledges are and what they might mean for you. You can ask your question via our form here. It is hard at this point to know quite how significant the Labour NHS trade talks document will turn out to be, but it is easily the most significant leak of the campaign so far. We have had surprise announcements from the parties about policy, and about strategy (eg, the Brexit party standing down in Tory-held seats), but this is a proper news story about stuff that has happened, not stuff that might happen in the future. Labour will be hoping that this has the potential to be a game-changer. (The charge that the NHS would be \u201cup for sale\u201d in a UK-US trade deal is one that resonates with voters, and alarms them, in a way that many Westminster policy/process stories don\u2019t.) In reality, very few things that happen in election campaigns turn out to be game-changer, but this may turn out to have enough heft to make the grade. This is what Jeremy Corbyn said about the documents in his opening speech. Voters need to ask themselves some very serious questions: is the NHS safe in Boris Johnson\u2019s hands? We\u2019ve now got evidence that under Boris Johnson the NHS is on the table and will be up for sale. He tried to cover it up in a secret agenda but today it\u2019s been exposed. Now we know the truth, when Johnson says, \u2018get Brexit done\u2019, it\u2019s a fraud on the British people. This is the reality. Years of bogged down negotiations and our NHS is up for sale. This election is now a fight for the survival of our National Health Service. As a public service free for all at the point of need. And here are some of the specific points he made about what the documents show. Corbyn said the documents showed that UK and US officials have discussed lengthening the time during which medicine patents apply. He explained: In fact, negotiations have advanced even further than we feared they had. The US and UK have already finished initial discussion on lengthening patents for medicines. Longer patents mean only one thing \u2013 more expensive drugs. Lives will be put at risk as a result of this. Many out-of-patent medicines available cheaply here are vastly more expensive under patent law in the US. The drug Humira for Crohn\u2019s disease and rheumatoid arthritis costs our NHS \u00a31,409 a packet. In the US, the same packet costs \u00a38,115. Get the difference \u2013 \u00a31,409 in our NHS, \u00a38,115 in the USA. One of the reasons for US drug prices being on average 250% of those here is a patent regime rigged for the big pharmaceutical companies ... If you look at the readout of the second meeting, on page 51, UK officials report that \u201cpatent issues\u201d around \u201cNHS access to generic drugs will be a key consideration\u201d in talks. US officials have \u201cpushed hard,\u201d the reports says, for longer patents for US drug companies. Corbyn said the documents showed that the two sides were closer to a deal than people expected. He said: You can also see on page 132 of the report of the fourth meeting, where drug patents are being discussed, that officials are ready to \u201cexchange text\u201d which is trade-negotiator-speak for it being at a very advanced stage. And they say they are ready to, I quote, \u201creally take significant further steps.\u201d He said the documents showed the US wanted \u201ctotal market access\u201d in a trade deal - implying health would be included. The new breed of trade deals are not only \u2013 or even mainly \u2013 about tariffs on goods at the border. They are also about services \u2013 including our health service. And these documents make clear that for the US, to quote page 41 of the third meeting report, \u201ceverything is included unless something is specifically excluded.\u201d They want, I quote: \u201cTotal market access\u201d as the \u201cbaseline assumption of the trade negotiations.\u201d \u201cTotal market access.\u201d Corbyn also said there was no evidence in the documents that the UK had pushed back against this. He went on: But surely you can\u2019t believe that British officials would demand the NHS be excluded? Apparently not. He said the documents showed that British officials said they would be a \u201cliberalising influence\u201d. In fact, on behalf of the Conservative government, officials reassured their counterparts that \u201cthe US should expect the UK to be a liberalising influence\u201d and that together they could \u201cfly the good flag for services liberalisation.\u201d That\u2019s a green light for breaking open Britain\u2019s public services so corporations can profit from. This is not surprising because the Tories have always said they would like free trade deals to cover services as well as good. He said the documents showed that a UK-US trade deal could provide protections for corporations, allowing them to sue governments in some circumstances for losses suffered. Officials have discussed a system to give corporations the power to sue our country. This is not only a plot against our NHS. It is a plot against the whole country. Again, this is not surprising. Provisions like this were included in the proposed US-EU trade deal. My colleague George Monbiot was one of those most critical of these provisions, but trade experts have defended them. Corbyn said the documents showed the Americans were offering to help the British persuade the public to accept the merits of chlorinated chicken. How about chlorine-washed chicken on our dinner tables? Have a look at the second meeting, on page 42 and 43, where the US even agrees to share its \u201cpublic lines\u201d to help our government with its \u201cmedia narratives.\u201d He said the documents showed the US favoured a no-deal Brexit. You might want to look at ... page one of meeting six for the US advocating a no-deal Brexit saying that would mean there\u2019d be \u201call to play for\u201d in a deal with Trump. I will be focusing on the Labour revelations about the UK-US trade talks, and their implications for the NHS, for the next half an hour or more, and will pick up what was said at the SNP manifesto launch later. But if you want to watch it, there is a live feed here. This is what Boris Johnson posted on Twitter this morning, less than an hour before the Labour announcement. Here is the full text of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s opening statement about the leaked documents that he says show the NHS is \u201con the table\u201d in UK-US trade talks. The leaked documents obtained by Labour do not seem to be available online, or in a digital form. Here is some more about what they say from journalists at the press conference who have seen the hard copies. Q: Could you clarify if you have evidence that ministers knew the NHS would be up for sale? Gardiner holds up the documents again. He says it does not take six meetings and 500 pages to say the NHS is not for sale. This documentation shows that the answer has been yes. He says he does not think there is any doubt about this. George Hollingbery, the international trade minister, met with officials to discuss this, he says. Q: Would Labour reverse existing privatisations? And what would that cost? Corbyn says the Health and Social Care Act encourages more privatisation in the NHS. This has led to private sector companies suing the NHS for contracts they don\u2019t get. He says this is unbelievable. Every penny spent on this is taken away from patients\u2019 needs. He says he wants to reverse that. He says he wants to bring everyone working for the NHS back into the NHS family. He is determined to \u201cdefend and rejuvenate\u201d the NHS. Q: It is clear from your interview last night that the claim that people earning less than \u00a380,000 won\u2019t pay higher tax under your plan is not true. Will you stop colleagues saying that? Corbyn says it is clear from Labour\u2019s grey book that people earning less than \u00a380,000 won\u2019t pay more in national insurance or tax. (He says tax, but may be referring to income tax.) The press conference is now over. Q: Was Lord Kerslake right to say, in the event of a hung parliament, your leadership would be on the agenda? Corbyn says there are no talks with other parties. He is fighting to win it. He is not fighting to form a coalition. Q: Isn\u2019t it the case that the Americans will always want to put everything on the table? Corbyn says these documents show that the two sides are starting to exchange treaty text. That suggests an agreement is close, he says. He says Labour would not accept investor protection provisions. Gardiner says Labour would not accept ISDS (investor state dispute settlement) provisions, or ICS (investment court system) provisions, a more modern alternative. He also says Labour would not accept a negative list procedure. This is an arrangement that would mean everything would be open to competition, unless otherwise specified. He says this system does not protect countries from competition in the event of new services coming into existence. Gardiner says other countries are adopting this approach to trade deals too. Q: Was yesterday the worst day of our campaign so far? Corbyn says he loves campaigning. Yesterday was another day when he went out to listen to people. He is horrified by what people tell him about inequality. Jeremy Corbyn is now taking questions. Q: [From Sky] Are you saying any trade deal with the US will be impossible without putting the NHS on the table? Q: [From ITV] Why would any British government do a deal that would make drugs more expensive in the UK? And do you accept President Trump\u2019s claim the NHS will not be on the table? Barry Gardiner, the shadow trade minister, answers on trade. He says there are four ways in which a trade deal can impact on the NHS: through the dispute settlement system; through what gets included; through changes to the patent regime; and through changes to the data regime. Q: [From the BBC] Do you have any evidence that ministers, as opposed to officials, agreed to the NHS being on the table in the talks? Corbyn says ministers sanctioned these talks, they were aware of the talks, and they declined to publish this information. Gardiner says George Hollingbery, a trade minister, was involved. Q: [From Sky] You did not apologise last night over antisemitism in the Labour party. Is that because you think you have not done anything wrong? Q: [From ITV] You say you are on the side of people. Does that include Jewish people? Q: [From the BBC] Do you accept the need to apologise to the Jewish community? Corbyn says antisemitism affects a tiny proportion of the party membership. But one is one too many. He says he accepts what the chief rabbi said yesterday. But there are many others in the Jewish community who do support Labour, he says. He says he is committed to getting rid of the scourge of racism in our society. He says the government he will lead would be the most anti-racist you have ever seen. At the news conference copies of the documents are now being handed out to journalists. Corbyn says it is now up to Boris Johnson to justify his decision to dismiss the Labour claim that the NHS would be on the table as an \u201cinvention\u201d. Labour will not let this rest, he says. Corbyn raises some specific points from the UK-US trade talks. He says page 43 shows how the Americans offered to give the British their lines to use to defend chlorinated chicken. And he says page 17 shows how the Americans refused to allow a mention of climate change in the deal. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now. He says, although only redacted documents of the talks between UK and US officials were released in response to a freedom of information request, Labour has now obtained 451 pages of documents about what was discussed. A Channel 4 Dispatches investigation first revealed these talks. Corbyn brandishes the new documents. He says they leave \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s denials in absolute tatters\u201d. He says these papers show that \u201cthe NHS is on the table and will be up for sale\u201d in a UK-US trade deal. There have been six rounds of talks, he says. But he says effectively it is all one negotiation. At the event Labour has just shown a short film featuring Jeremy Corbyn challenging Boris Johnson in the ITV debate last week over private meetings between UK and US officials about including health in a trade deal. Jeremy Corbyn is about to give a speech on the NHS at Westminster. There will be a live feed at the top of the blog soon. Labour has not briefed any of it in advance, and so we don\u2019t know what Corbyn is planning to say. Adam Price had more to say about growing up gay in Wales in this BBC Breakfast interview. Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru leader, has urged Boris Johnson to apologise for referring to gay men as \u201cbum boys\u201d in newspaper column in the past. Price has been taking part in a BBC phone-in on BBC News and Radio 5 Live, and he was asked who he would rather have a pint with, Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn. Price, who is gay, replied: Not Boris Johnson ... It has to be Jeremy Corbyn. Jeremy Corbyn has not called people like me a bum boy ... Why can\u2019t people just say the most powerful word, sorry? Johnson was specifically asked about his use of the term \u201cbum boys\u201d in a newspaper column on Question Time on Friday night. Fiona Bruce put it to him that this was one of several examples of his having used racist or homophobic language. Johnson refused to apologise. Price said that he thought politicians should be willing to apologise, and he said Jeremy Corbyn should also have apologised in his Andrew Neil interview last night for his handling of the antisemitism issue. Price said: I think people respond well to politicians holding their hand up and saying I got it wrong. Johnson used the term \u201cbum boys\u201d in a 1998 column about the resignation of Peter Mandelson. In his Today interview Robert Jenrick was also asked about this specific complaint about Islamophobia in the Conservative party. A deputy chair of Stourbridge Conservative association resigned in protest at the attitude taken by fellow Tories when interviewing a Muslim who wanted to stand as a council candidate. In response to a question about this incident, Jenrick said: Well that\u2019s the first I\u2019ve heard of that allegation, if that\u2019s correct, and it\u2019s extremely serious and deserves to be investigated and action deserves to be taken. Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, told the Today programme this morning that the findings of the inquiry into racism in the Conservative party will be published. He said: We want to be a party that has no tolerance whatsoever of racism, prejudice or discrimination of any kind. I want to see by the end of this year, as the prime minister\u2019s promised, a thorough review of prejudice and racism and discrimination within the party. This will be a very thorough investigation led by independent individuals and the findings of it will be put into the public domain. So yes, I hope it will lay out the facts with regard to the Conservative party\u2019s record on discrimination of any kind and we will take the steps that are required. The Conservatives have said they will launch the inquiry before Christmas. But they don\u2019t seem very keen on launching it before polling day \u2013 perhaps because they are worried that the terms of reference will provoke complaints, either from party members who feel they go too far, or from non-members who feel they do not go far enough. Kirsty Blackman, the SNP\u2019s deputy Westminster leader, has suggested that a change of Labour leader could be one of the demands made by her party in exchange for post-election support for a minority government, as Jewish leaders in Scotland warned Nicola Sturgeon against making any post-election pact with Jeremy Corbyn. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland programme, Blackman was asked if the SNP would demand a change of leader if it were to work with Labour, having been so critical of the party\u2019s handling of antisemitism charges. She replied: We\u2019ll look at all of the possible demands there are. There are massive problems with Jeremy Corbyn, he has not dealt with the antisemitism properly and he should have done. Asked about the chief rabbi\u2019s comments yesterday, she said: I believe that there\u2019s problems with antisemitism in the Labour party, absolutely, and that they have not dealt appropriately with them. And also that [Corbyn] should have apologised when he was on the news yesterday. Asked if she it was appropriate to support a leader who has acted that way, she said that the choice for English voters was \u201cbetween the devil and the deep blue sea\u201d. We don\u2019t have a say over how the Labour party chooses their leader. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a brilliant process and Jeremy Corbyn is not the leader we would choose. Pressed on how Scotland could \u201cescape Brexit\u201d by voting SNP, Blackman also resurrected the idea of an \u201call-nations lock\u201d on a second EU referendum, proposed by Labour, meaning that if Scotland voted to remain as it did in 2016 this would act as a veto on Brexit. This morning, Paul Edlin, president of the Glasgow Jewish Representative Council, warned Nicola Sturgeon would be doing \u201ca deal with the devil\u201d if she were to help Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Damien Gayle. In his Today interview earlier (see 7.43am) Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, was also asked about Labour\u2019s plan to spend \u00a358bn compensation the Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) women - the women who have lost out from increases in the state pension age, which was not well advertised when it was decided in the 1990s. He defended the decision, saying these women were effectively the victims of \u201ctheft\u201d. He said: I make no apology, the Labour party makes no apology for taking the action necessary to right this wrong. These women had paid in, they expected this in their pensions, they were short-changed, that\u2019s wrong. This amounts to theft or robbery of money that these women paid into, money that they are entitled to. It\u2019s a wrong that needs righting. About 660,000 people registered to vote yesterday, the deadline for the 12 December election, of whom almost 460,000 were under 35, according to official statistics. The numbers of last-minute registrations were even higher than in 2017, when 622,000 people registered to vote on 22 May, of which about 450,000 were under 35. Those numbers were cited at the time as partly responsible for the \u201cyouthquake\u201d that gave Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party its highest share of the vote and first gain in seats since the 2001 election. Younger voters skew heavily towards Labour. As much as the party leaders want to pull the agenda away from allegations of prejudice, the news cycle is not allowing them. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning, Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, was challenged over Nia Griffiths\u2019 call last night for a fresh apology to the Jewish community over the allegations of antisemitism within Labour. (See 6.50am.) He was asked should Jeremy Corbyn also have apologised when challenged over the issue by Andrew Neil during a BBC interview last night? Burgon said he already had. Jeremy has apologised on a number of occasions and said he\u2019s sorry for the very real hurt felt by people in the Jewish community. So on a number of occasions, last summer for example, he\u2019s made this statement, and it\u2019s right that he did. A Labour government, Burgon pointed out, would make antisemitism awareness a part of the curriculum for schools. Burgon was previously forced to apologise after calling zionism, the political ideology that calls for a Jewish state in the Middle East, an \u201cenemy of peace\u201d. Nia Griffith, the shadow defence secretary, joined the ranks of Labour MPs calling for more action within the party for addressing antisemitism. Speaking during a BBC Wales Live debate last night, she said: I would say absolutely that we need to apologise to our colleagues within my own party who have been very upset but to the whole of the Jewish community as well that we have not been as effective as we should have been in dealing with this problem and it is a shame on us, it really is, and it is something that I am very, very ashamed of and it is something that we absolutely must put right. How the papers covered it Our full wrap of the newspapers\u2019 front pages is here. Jeremy Corbyn will make a statement on NHS in London at 10am, before heading to Falmouth to speak at a climate change rally tonight. Johnson will be in the south-west talking about boosting phone signal in rural areas. The SNP will launch its manifesto in Glasgow at 11am. Nigel Farage will be in Doncaster. Chuka Umunna, Sam Gyimah and Michael Heseltine will be giving a press conference in London. Good morning, politics-watchers. I hope you\u2019ve all had better sleeps than the one I imagine Jeremy Corbyn had last night after a bruising day for the Labour leader. The antisemitism accusations \u2013 which came on the day Labour was seeking to brand itself as the party of equality and compassion through the launch of its race and faith manifesto \u2013 dogged the party all day, and look as if they will be difficult to shake, after Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s interview with Andrew Neil last night in which he repeatedly resisted calls to apologise to the Jewish community. The Guardian\u2019s religion correspondent, Harriet Sherwood, spoke to Jewish community leaders and heard that while plenty of Jews in the UK would say the chief rabbi does not speak for them, many, probably most, agree with the thrust of his unprecedented intervention in the election campaign. After a difficult day, the Labour leader will be aiming to steer the conversation back to safer ground, by making a \u201cmajor statement\u201d on the NHS in Westminster in the morning and then heading to Falmouth where he will address a climate change rally. Boris Johnson will also be hoping to move away from talk of faith, after comments by the prime minister likening Muslim women who wear veils to \u201cletterboxes\u201d or \u201cbank robbers\u201d resurfaced. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, was asked about the comments yesterday and refused to condemn them. Johnson later dismissed criticism by the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB). The MCB has also released a report urging parties to tackle racism and Islamophobia to win the support of Muslim voters, which particularly singled out the Conservatives and \u201csections of the media\u201d for \u201cgrowing Islamophobia\u201d. The prime minister will be in the south-west today, setting out plans for new phone masts and shared infrastructure to strengthen phone signals in rural areas. Again, will this be enough to make voters forget about Johnson\u2019s comments? We\u2019ll see. Thanks for reading along with us today, I\u2019ll be at the helm of the blog for the first hour, you can get in touch with me on Twitter or via email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com).",

On 25 July in the House of Commons, the day after he was appointed prime minister, he told MPs: \u201cI will make one important point that it is worth making: under no circumstances will we agree to any free-trade deal that puts the NHS on the table. It is not for sale.\u201d</p> \n<p>He has repeated that position during the election campaign, including on 19 November in the ITV leadership debate. \u201cThere are no circumstances \u2026 in which this government or any Conservative will put the NHS on the table in any free-trade negotiation,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>After the publication of the unredacted record of trade talks between the UK and US, he maintained the line while campaigning in Cornwall on Wednesday. \u201cThe NHS is not on the table in any way,\u201d Johnson said.</p> \n<h2>What do the documents show?</h2> \n<p>The documents show that between July 2017 and July this year, trade talks between the UK and US have covered the NHS, drug pricing and patents, the pharmaceutical industry and medical devices, in the context of the future trade landscape between the two countries.</p> \n<p>US trade officials explained clearly their approach to trade talks, described as \u201cnegative listing\u201d, which involves starting the talks with nothing off the table, the assumption being that total market access is the starting point for any discussions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a6afef8e-fbcf-4a5a-a877-b8e8383813b2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Jw-uO38FO_I?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>How does drug pricing in the UK work now?</h2> \n<p>The UK has some of the lowest drug prices in Europe. A key reason for that is the existence of the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/about/who-we-are/history-of-nice\">set up in 1999</a>. It is an independent expert body that assesses evidence and issues guidance to the NHS and health professionals about which drugs, types of surgery and other forms of treatment benefit patients and are worth spending money on. As such it determines what drugs do and do not represent value for money for NHS bodies in England and Wales to buy to give to patients.</p> \n<p>Nice has a ceiling of \u00a330,000 per year of \u201cgood quality life\u201d gained, rising to \u00a350,000 for end-of-life drugs such as cancer drugs. Nice\u2019s judgments help keep prices down by capping what the NHS can spend on them. So does the NHS\u2019s status as a bulk buyer of drugs, and EU-wide rules on patents.</p> \n<h2>What do the Americans want to change?</h2> \n<p>The minutes of the trade talks show the Trump administration and US pharmaceutical interests want the British government to dismantle the safeguards that protect the NHS from paying high prices for drugs. (Drugs in America cost two and a half times what they cost in the UK.)</p> \n<p>They want, for example, \u201cfull market access\u201d for US drugs, which would greatly limit Nice\u2019s ability to decide which medicines patients can receive. They also want future prices to be \u201cmarket-derived\u201d or \u201ccompetitive\u201d, which again would lead to Nice being marginalised.</p> \n<h2>Corbyn mentioned patents. Why do they matter?</h2> \n<p>Crucially, US officials want longer patents for American drugs, which would boost their makers\u2019 profits and limit the NHS\u2019s scope to buy much cheaper generic versions. They have suggested in the talks a number of changes, all of which \u2013 if agreed \u2013 would benefit pharma firms financially. They include \u201cpatent linkage\u201d, grace periods and \u201cpatent term extension and adjustment\u201d, which UK officials described as \u201cthe three big defensive areas for us\u201d in detailed discussions about drug patents.</p> \n<p>This is a difficult issue for the UK because it is a leading member of the <a href=\"https://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/epc.html\">European Patent Convention</a>, though it is not an EU body.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has claimed official documents obtained by the Labour party show that the US is demanding the NHS will be \u201con the table\u201d in talks on a post-Brexit trade deal. The Labour leader said the uncensored papers gave the lie to Boris Johnson\u2019s claims that the NHS would not be part of any trade talks and revealed that the US wanted \u201ctotal market access\u201d after the UK leaves the EU. What has Boris Johnson said? Johnson has repeatedly denied that the NHS is on the table in any trade talks or for sale. On 25 July in the House of Commons, the day after he was appointed prime minister, he told MPs: \u201cI will make one important point that it is worth making: under no circumstances will we agree to any free-trade deal that puts the NHS on the table. It is not for sale.\u201d He has repeated that position during the election campaign, including on 19 November in the ITV leadership debate. \u201cThere are no circumstances \u2026 in which this government or any Conservative will put the NHS on the table in any free-trade negotiation,\u201d he said. After the publication of the unredacted record of trade talks between the UK and US, he maintained the line while campaigning in Cornwall on Wednesday. \u201cThe NHS is not on the table in any way,\u201d Johnson said. What do the documents show? The documents show that between July 2017 and July this year, trade talks between the UK and US have covered the NHS, drug pricing and patents, the pharmaceutical industry and medical devices, in the context of the future trade landscape between the two countries. US trade officials explained clearly their approach to trade talks, described as \u201cnegative listing\u201d, which involves starting the talks with nothing off the table, the assumption being that total market access is the starting point for any discussions. How does drug pricing in the UK work now? The UK has some of the lowest drug prices in Europe. A key reason for that is the existence of the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government set up in 1999. It is an independent expert body that assesses evidence and issues guidance to the NHS and health professionals about which drugs, types of surgery and other forms of treatment benefit patients and are worth spending money on. As such it determines what drugs do and do not represent value for money for NHS bodies in England and Wales to buy to give to patients. Nice has a ceiling of \u00a330,000 per year of \u201cgood quality life\u201d gained, rising to \u00a350,000 for end-of-life drugs such as cancer drugs. Nice\u2019s judgments help keep prices down by capping what the NHS can spend on them. So does the NHS\u2019s status as a bulk buyer of drugs, and EU-wide rules on patents. What do the Americans want to change? The minutes of the trade talks show the Trump administration and US pharmaceutical interests want the British government to dismantle the safeguards that protect the NHS from paying high prices for drugs. (Drugs in America cost two and a half times what they cost in the UK.) They want, for example, \u201cfull market access\u201d for US drugs, which would greatly limit Nice\u2019s ability to decide which medicines patients can receive. They also want future prices to be \u201cmarket-derived\u201d or \u201ccompetitive\u201d, which again would lead to Nice being marginalised. Corbyn mentioned patents. Why do they matter? Crucially, US officials want longer patents for American drugs, which would boost their makers\u2019 profits and limit the NHS\u2019s scope to buy much cheaper generic versions. They have suggested in the talks a number of changes, all of which \u2013 if agreed \u2013 would benefit pharma firms financially. They include \u201cpatent linkage\u201d, grace periods and \u201cpatent term extension and adjustment\u201d, which UK officials described as \u201cthe three big defensive areas for us\u201d in detailed discussions about drug patents. This is a difficult issue for the UK because it is a leading member of the European Patent Convention, though it is not an EU body.",

As a result, there is an extremely real possibility that, by the time of the next scheduled election in 2024, the United Kingdom as we know it will no longer exist. Scotland may by then have voted to become an independent country. Northern Ireland may have voted to unify with the Irish republic. But you would hardly know any of this from the general election campaign so far.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/19/general-election-leaders-debate-who-won-jeremy-corbyn-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">leaders\u2019 debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn</a>, there was much discussion of Brexit. But there was no discussion about Brexit\u2019s consequences for the parts of the UK \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/15/majority-of-scottish-voters-feel-ignored-by-uk-ministers-on-brexit\" title=\"\">Scotland</a> and Northern Ireland \u2013 that did not vote for it. Nor was there a single word about Brexit\u2019s effect on the unresolved divides in Ireland. This was genuinely remarkable. For the past three years, the issue of Ireland has been at the very core of the argument about Brexit. But now, from the leaders of Britain\u2019s two main parties, there was absolutely nothing. Not for the first time in British political debate, it was as though Ireland simply did not exist.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a black hole not just in the election campaign, but in our politics where a unified nation is supposed to be</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet this conspiracy of inattention ignores two looming existential challenges to the cohesion of the country. The possibility that Scotland and Northern Ireland might cease to be part of a union with England and Wales after Brexit does not emerge from a cloudless sky. The Scottish nationalist government has been clear since 2017 that it is demanding an independence referendum because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/02/nicola-sturgeon-scots-must-send-resounding-message-over-independence-vote\" title=\"\">it wants Scotland exempted from Brexit</a>. On Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/27/nicola-sturgeon-boris-johnson-is-dangerous-and-unfit-for-office-snp-manifesto\" title=\"\">, the Scottish National party reiterated its demand for this to happen in 2020</a>. Northern Ireland\u2019s unionists are now in revolt against a Brexit deal that would cut them off from Britain. All this has been in the news for months. Yet it forms no part of the mainstream campaign debate.</p> <p>In last Friday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/22/question-time-leaders-special-who-won-johnson-corbyn-swinson-sturgeon\" title=\"\">studio quizzing of the four main party leaders, </a>, in which Johnson and Corbyn were joined by Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon, things improved a little.

      "bodyText": "If the Conservatives win a majority on 12 December, as they are favourites to do, they will claim a mandate to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. As a result, there is an extremely real possibility that, by the time of the next scheduled election in 2024, the United Kingdom as we know it will no longer exist. Scotland may by then have voted to become an independent country. Northern Ireland may have voted to unify with the Irish republic. But you would hardly know any of this from the general election campaign so far. In the leaders\u2019 debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, there was much discussion of Brexit. But there was no discussion about Brexit\u2019s consequences for the parts of the UK \u2013 Scotland and Northern Ireland \u2013 that did not vote for it. Nor was there a single word about Brexit\u2019s effect on the unresolved divides in Ireland. This was genuinely remarkable. For the past three years, the issue of Ireland has been at the very core of the argument about Brexit. But now, from the leaders of Britain\u2019s two main parties, there was absolutely nothing. Not for the first time in British political debate, it was as though Ireland simply did not exist. Yet this conspiracy of inattention ignores two looming existential challenges to the cohesion of the country. The possibility that Scotland and Northern Ireland might cease to be part of a union with England and Wales after Brexit does not emerge from a cloudless sky. The Scottish nationalist government has been clear since 2017 that it is demanding an independence referendum because it wants Scotland exempted from Brexit. On Wednesday , the Scottish National party reiterated its demand for this to happen in 2020. Northern Ireland\u2019s unionists are now in revolt against a Brexit deal that would cut them off from Britain. All this has been in the news for months. Yet it forms no part of the mainstream campaign debate. In last Friday\u2019s studio quizzing of the four main party leaders, , in which Johnson and Corbyn were joined by Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon, things improved a little. There was still not a single word about Ireland. But the presence of Sturgeon meant at least that Scotland formed part of the debate. Significantly, Corbyn announced that he would not allow the SNP to hold a second independence referendum in at least the first two years of a Labour government. Sturgeon responded confidently that she did not expect Corbyn to stick to that pledge if Labour found itself needing SNP votes in order to govern after 12 December.

He said he continued to believe that a Conservative government was best for the country, including Muslim communities, but gave the example of the former Labour MP for Luton South, Gavin Shuker, who highlighted antisemitism within his party.

Unable to contain her delight, she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SayeedaWarsi/status/1141077310952620032\" title=\"\"> tweeted her thanks to Javid</a>, who now serves as chancellor. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame,\u201d she added, \u201cthat it\u2019s taken four years and a leadership contest to finally drag my colleagues kicking and screaming to address this issue.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking at her home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, Warsi recalls her initial elation. \u201cI thought wow, we\u2019ve finally broken through,\u201d she says, revealing that though she had been lobbying Javid behind the scenes she had no idea he was going to call for the inquiry during the debate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8a0242049e795acf52a0113e20007f778e6eff94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a0242049e795acf52a0113e20007f778e6eff94/308_22_1853_1112/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove is seen outside Downing Street in London, Britain November 5, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Gove insisted the Tories would \u2018absolutely\u2019 hold an \u2018independent inquiry into Islamophobia\u2019 in the Tory party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yara Nardi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, however, it appears that that commitment has been watered down. Earlier this month, days after Gove insisted that the Tories would \u201cabsolutely\u201d hold an independent inquiry into Islamophobia before the end of the year, <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/conservative-party/boris-johnson/news/107875/boris-johnson-faces-backlash\" title=\"\">Johnson performed a U-turn</a>. It would instead be a \u201cgeneral investigation into prejudice of all kinds\u201d.</p> <p>This is not the first time Warsi has found herself at odds with her colleagues. \u201cI\u2019m really, really hesitant about making this Sayeeda v the Tory party,\u201d she says, but \u201cit\u2019s increasingly becoming like that because there are so few other voices.\u201d</p> <p>This is the party that she once chaired. \u201cThere is a lot of emotional attachment here. It\u2019s like a really painful divorce. It does feel like I\u2019m in an abusive relationship at the moment, where I\u2019m with somebody that I really shouldn\u2019t be with. It\u2019s not healthy for me to be there any more with the Conservative party.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to deny the Tories have a problem with Islamophobia. Yesterday, as the chief rabbi claimed the \u201cpoison\u201d of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/25/labour-has-let-poison-of-antisemitism-take-root-says-chief-rabbi\" title=\"\">antisemitism had taken root within the Labour party</a>, the Muslim Council of Britain said that the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MuslimCouncil/status/1199293555124178945?s=20\" title=\"\">Tories had a \u201cblind spot\u201d for Islamophobia</a>.

Some had described Saudis as \u201csand peasants\u201d or shared material comparing Asian people to dogs.</p> <p>In April, the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/25/tory-candidates-suspended-over-racist-and-inflammatory-posts\" title=\"\">exposed how two Conservative local election candidates and a woman honoured with an MBE were among 40 new self-professed Tory members who shared or endorsed racist and inflammatory Facebook posts, including Islamophobic material</a>. This time, Muslims had been described as \u201cbin-bag-wearing individuals\u201d, there had been calls for the \u201ccult\u201d of Islam to be banned and the Qur\u2019an had been branded an \u201cevil book\u201d.</p> <p>In the same month it emerged that Nusrat Ghani, the UK\u2019s only female Muslim minister, had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/17/tory-activist-sent-muslim-minister-emails-praising-enoch-powell\" title=\"\">bombarded with emails from a Conservative activist praising Enoch Powell\u2019s \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech</a> and questioning whether immigrants should be allowed to stand for parliament.</p> <p>This month, the Guardian was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/12/revealed-conservative-councillors-islamophobic-social-media\" title=\"\">passed a dossier</a> compiled by the holder of an anonymous Twitter account, @matesjacob, exposing past and sitting councillors who have posted Islamophobic and racist material on social media. To date, @matesjacob says he has unearthed more than 200 examples of self-declared Tory members, as well as current and former councillors, who have made Islamophobic or racist posts. The party has often responded to these disclosures with suspensions but has faced criticism for the opaque nature of its complaints process.</p> <p>In June, a survey by YouGov for the anti-racism group <a href=\"https://www.hopenothate.org.uk/2019/06/21/conservative-crisis-islamophobia/\" title=\"\">Hope Not Hate</a> found that more than half of Tory party members believe Islam is a threat to \u201cthe British way of life\u201d.</p> <p>Javid \u2013 who put his Pakistani family heritage at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHr5OuhhzQ\" title=\"\">heart of his leadership bid</a> \u2013 appeared to have fallen into line with No 10 about the revised inquiry, <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/conservative-party/news/107884/sajid-javid-confirms-tory-racism-probe-will\" title=\"\">telling the BBC</a>: \u201cIt makes absolute sense to look at all types of prejudice.\u201d</p> <p>Warsi says Javid has faced a \u201chuge amount of pressure to pull back\u201d, adding: \u201cHe\u2019s chancellor of the exchequer. He\u2019s got the second or third most powerful role in government and he still doesn\u2019t feel like he can exercise power? I get this art of playing politics to get to a position where you\u2019re increasingly more powerful \u2026 but I think that politicians are so focused on amassing power that they forget about what they\u2019re amassing it for.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e89bd030bd85020c43d5f127b66f5ae1cde5ba80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e89bd030bd85020c43d5f127b66f5ae1cde5ba80/0_323_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the chancellor, Sajid Javid.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It makes absolute sense to look at all types of prejudice\u2019 \u2026 the chancellor, Sajid Javid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But she is also sympathetic towards the chancellor, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/06/culture-secretary-sajid-javid-interview\" title=\"\">acknowledged a \u201cMuslim heritage\u201d but practises no religion</a>. \u201cI think deep down he does genuinely care about this stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause if you take the definition of Islamophobia, it\u2019s not about religiosity or Islam or whether you\u2019re actually a Muslim, it\u2019s Muslimness or perceived Muslimness.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, Javid\u2019s government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/may/15/uk-ministers-criticised-rejecting-new-definition-islamophobia\" title=\"\">faced criticism for rejecting a working definition of Islamophobia</a> along those lines set out by a cross-party report adopted by Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Scottish Conservatives.</p> <p>In a statement, Javid told the Guardian: \u201cI remember vividly being called a \u2018Paki bastard\u2019 in the school playground. Like Sayeeda, and so many others, I know what it\u2019s like to face prejudice \u2013 as a child, in the workplace and in politics. I pay tribute to all those calling out discrimination wherever they see it. We will only defeat racism by working together. We will investigate anti-Muslim hatred as part of an inquiry into all kinds of prejudice.\u201d</p> <p>Warsi thrust the issue of British Islamophobia into the spotlight in 2011, while serving in David Cameron\u2019s cabinet. This bigotry had, she said, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jan/20/lady-warsi-islamophobia-muslims-prejudice\" title=\"\">\u201cpassed the dinner-table test\u201d</a> and become widely acceptable. In 2015, by which time she had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/05/lady-warsi-resigns-government-gaza-stance\" title=\"\">resigned from the cabinet</a> because of the government\u2019s \u201cmorally indefensible\u201d stance on the Gaza crisis, she raised the issue of Islamophobia in the Conservatives. Late that year, she began informally contacting the party chairman\u2019s office about anti-Muslim hatred perpetrated by Conservatives on social media but says she encountered a \u201cbureaucracy wall\u201d<em>. </em>In October 2017, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/anti-islam-tapan-ghosh-bob-blackman-rohingya-muslims-a8020656.html\" title=\"\">the Tory backbench MP Bob Blackman sparked outrage when he hosted Tapan Ghosh</a>, an anti-Islamic extremist who once praised the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, as keynote speaker in parliament.<strong> </strong>In 2018, Warsi went public with a call for the Conservatives to hold an inquiry.</p> <p>Warsi, 48, the daughter of a Pakistani immigrant mill worker who later built a \u00a32m-a-year bed manufacturing company, makes it clear that campaigning has taken its toll. \u201cThere are times when you look out to beautiful greenery in peaceful Yorkshire when I think, I don\u2019t know why I bother with this any more.\u201d</p> <p>However, she says, \u201cI know that for the sake of the future I have to stay. I can\u2019t just say: \u2018Look, I\u2019ve had enough, see you later, bye bye.\u2019\u201d Asked if her party is pushing her away, she pauses before saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think it makes it easy for me to stay \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Has she seriously considered leaving the Tories? \u201cI\u2019ve considered leaving politics, not just the Conservative party. I\u2019ve considered walking away from Westminster, full stop.\u201d Over Islamophobia? \u201cOver generally the state of politics, the way in which politics is done \u2026 There are so many lies that are told, there\u2019s very little fact and logical reasoning. The general nastiness around the space.\u201d But Islamophobia has \u201cforced\u201d her back to the frontline. </p> <p>She has not been entirely alone in her battle. The former Conservative MEP Sajjad Karim says the party is in denial over the extent of Islamophobia and risks becoming the Brexit party \u201cin all but name\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9b12da5edf0b3f71767bacf76c38dc460042d21f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b12da5edf0b3f71767bacf76c38dc460042d21f/0_656_6345_3824/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the former Tory MEP Sajjad Karim.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"603\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Those of us that are bringing Islamophobia up and reminding them of this issue are just regarded as banging on about something that is damaging the party and not really an issue in itself\u2019 \u2026 the former Tory MEP Sajjad Karim.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2013, he says he overheard two MPs, one of whom is a serving minister, \u201chaving an Islamophobic conversation about me and my religious and cultural background\u201d. He will not name the minister but says that, after going public, he was contacted by Conservative HQ and asked whether he would like to make a complaint using the standard procedure. He declined because of the \u201cdelicate\u201d nature of the complaint but said he would meet with the chairman, James Cleverly, \u201csetting out exactly what happened so that he can go away and deal with it\u201d. He says he never heard back.</p> <p>Karim, who was an MEP for 15 years before losing his seat earlier this year, doubts his former party colleagues\u2019 willingness to tackle \u2013 or even acknowledge \u2013 the problem. \u201cThey just see it as a nuisance. Those of us that are bringing it up and reminding them of this issue are just regarded as banging on about something that is damaging the party and not really an issue in itself.\u201d</p> <p>Warsi has also raised concerns about the views of senior government figures, warning earlier this year that she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/29/lady-warsi-says-she-fears-michael-gove-becoming-pm\" title=\"\">feared Michael Gove becoming prime minster</a> because of his views on Muslims. Now she goes further, saying she has \u201cno doubt\u201d Gove \u2013 who wrote a controversial book in 2006 called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/29/lady-warsi-says-she-fears-michael-gove-becoming-pm\" title=\"\">Celsius 7/7 about Islamism in the UK</a> \u2013 is Islamophobic. \u201cI think Michael\u2019s view is there is no such thing as a non-problematic Muslim. I think that in his world there\u2019s an extremist lurking behind anyone who professes to be connected to Islam or Muslims in any way shape or form,\u201d she explains.</p> <p>\u201cOn one occasion the prime minister, David [Cameron] pulled him up on it around the cabinet table for some comment that he made. He just turned around and went: \u2018Enough, Michael.\u2019 It was about Muslims.\u201d A spokesman for Gove calls these claims \u201ccategorically untrue\u201d.</p> <p>In relation to Johnson, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/06/boris-johnsons-burqa-remarks-fan-flames-of-islamophobia-says-mp\" title=\"\">prompted outrage by writing last year that woman wearing burqas looked like \u201cletter boxes\u201d</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/boris-johnson-islam-muslim-world-centuries-behind-2007-essay\" title=\"\">argued in 2007 that Islam caused the Muslim world to be \u201cliterally centuries behind\u201d</a>, she is more sympathetic, describing him as a \u201ccentre-ground, liberal Conservative\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s made stupid remarks and I think he thinks he\u2019s too clever by half.

I do not think he wants to go out and attack Muslims simply for being Muslim or wants to make life difficult for them. I genuinely don\u2019t believe that.

He joined the Tories in 1983, he says, \u201cbecause I believed in the economic ideology\u201d, despite \u201cknowing it was full of old white racists\u201d. He felt the party reached out to ethnic minority voters under Cameron\u2019s reign but that a turning point was reached in 2016 during the Tory London mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith\u2019s campaign. Afterwards, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/07/top-conservatives-condemn-zac-goldsmiths-disgusting-mayoral-campaign\" title=\"\">Amin spoke out in dismay at Goldsmith\u2019s efforts to smear Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan as a \u201ccloset extremist\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Last year, Amin persuaded colleagues at the forum to back a call for an inquiry, arguing that it \u201ccouldn\u2019t simply be a silent bystander\u201d. In June, however, he was <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-06-21/conservative-muslim-chair-says-he-was-expelled-from-group-for-questioning-boris-johnsons-moral-fitness/\" title=\"\">expelled from the forum</a> after attacking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/14/i-will-quit-if-boris-johnson-becomes-pm-tory-muslim-chairman-mohammed-amin\" title=\"\">Johnson\u2019s moral integrity</a> during a Radio 4 interview in which he compared his popularity to Adolf Hitler\u2019s. When Johnson took over as leader, Amin resigned from the party and defected to the Lib Dems.</p> <p>He now describes Islamophobia in the Conservatives as a \u201cslow-motion disaster\u201d, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s an institutional problem inside the party about being transparent about anything, and that has seriously impaired its ability to get to grips with the Islamophobic problem \u2013 and to be seen to be getting to grips with it. And an unwillingness to really ask the question: what is it about the Conservative party that attracts these people?\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this month, Kyle Pedley, the deputy chair of Stourbridge Conservative Association in the West Midlands, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-50421218\" title=\"\">resigned, feeling \u201caghast\u201d, after claiming he witnessed a Muslim man who was seeking to be chosen as a council candidate being interrogated about his religion by party officers</a> during a selection meeting.

How many times a year do you go to the mosque?\u201d The local chair denied any Islamophobia.</p> <p>Kishan Devani, a former Tory parliamentary candidate and deputy chair of the party in London, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/former-tory-parliamentary-candidate-kishan-devani-leaves-liberal-democrats-islamophobia-refugees-a8390121.html\" title=\"\">quit the Conservatives in late 2017</a> because he felt uncomfortable with a failure to deal with Islamophobia and because of what he saw as a lurch to the right. Devani, who is of a Hindu background, and is now standing as a parliamentary candidate for the Lib Dems in Wales, said: \u201cI heard of the way people were talked down, the way people were sidelined because of their race and their background and their religion. I thought, \u2018This is disgusting \u2013 this cannot be how people are treated.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>With the party\u2019s eyes fixed firmly on the election, there could be more trouble on the horizon for the Conservatives. In May, the Muslim Council of Britain filed a complaint to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/may/28/watchdog-urged-to-launch-inquiry-into-tory-islamophobia\" title=\"\">urging the watchdog to investigate Islamophobia in the Tory party</a>.

She is sceptical about Johnson\u2019s motivation for broadening the inquiry, but says she would still get involved, revealing that a senior party official recently sounded her out about taking part. \u201cIf that\u2019s the only way to get scrutiny, I\u2019m not just going to sit back and have a monk [sulk] on, as they say in Yorkshire.\u201d But, she says firmly, she is \u201cnot prepared to rubber-stamp some nonsensical inquiry\u201d.</p>",

Earlier that evening, during a televised Tory leadership debate, Javid had bounced his fellow contenders, including Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, into apparently agreeing to the Conservatives holding an independent inquiry into Islamophobia. For Lady Warsi, who had tirelessly campaigned against Islamophobia for years, having been the country\u2019s first female Muslim cabinet minister, it was a moment she had longed to see. Unable to contain her delight, she tweeted her thanks to Javid, who now serves as chancellor. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame,\u201d she added, \u201cthat it\u2019s taken four years and a leadership contest to finally drag my colleagues kicking and screaming to address this issue.\u201d Speaking at her home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, Warsi recalls her initial elation. \u201cI thought wow, we\u2019ve finally broken through,\u201d she says, revealing that though she had been lobbying Javid behind the scenes she had no idea he was going to call for the inquiry during the debate. Now, however, it appears that that commitment has been watered down. Earlier this month, days after Gove insisted that the Tories would \u201cabsolutely\u201d hold an independent inquiry into Islamophobia before the end of the year, Johnson performed a U-turn. It would instead be a \u201cgeneral investigation into prejudice of all kinds\u201d. This is not the first time Warsi has found herself at odds with her colleagues. \u201cI\u2019m really, really hesitant about making this Sayeeda v the Tory party,\u201d she says, but \u201cit\u2019s increasingly becoming like that because there are so few other voices.\u201d This is the party that she once chaired. \u201cThere is a lot of emotional attachment here. It\u2019s like a really painful divorce. It does feel like I\u2019m in an abusive relationship at the moment, where I\u2019m with somebody that I really shouldn\u2019t be with. It\u2019s not healthy for me to be there any more with the Conservative party.\u201d It\u2019s hard to deny the Tories have a problem with Islamophobia. Yesterday, as the chief rabbi claimed the \u201cpoison\u201d of antisemitism had taken root within the Labour party, the Muslim Council of Britain said that the Tories had a \u201cblind spot\u201d for Islamophobia. And Javid\u2019s pledge followed a string of damaging revelations, via Buzzfeed, the BBC and ITV News and the Guardian. In March, this newspaper revealed how 15 Conservative councillors who were suspended over posting Islamophobic or racist content online had their membership quietly reinstated. Some had described Saudis as \u201csand peasants\u201d or shared material comparing Asian people to dogs. In April, the Guardian exposed how two Conservative local election candidates and a woman honoured with an MBE were among 40 new self-professed Tory members who shared or endorsed racist and inflammatory Facebook posts, including Islamophobic material. This time, Muslims had been described as \u201cbin-bag-wearing individuals\u201d, there had been calls for the \u201ccult\u201d of Islam to be banned and the Qur\u2019an had been branded an \u201cevil book\u201d. In the same month it emerged that Nusrat Ghani, the UK\u2019s only female Muslim minister, had been bombarded with emails from a Conservative activist praising Enoch Powell\u2019s \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech and questioning whether immigrants should be allowed to stand for parliament. This month, the Guardian was passed a dossier compiled by the holder of an anonymous Twitter account, @matesjacob, exposing past and sitting councillors who have posted Islamophobic and racist material on social media. To date, @matesjacob says he has unearthed more than 200 examples of self-declared Tory members, as well as current and former councillors, who have made Islamophobic or racist posts. The party has often responded to these disclosures with suspensions but has faced criticism for the opaque nature of its complaints process. In June, a survey by YouGov for the anti-racism group Hope Not Hate found that more than half of Tory party members believe Islam is a threat to \u201cthe British way of life\u201d. Javid \u2013 who put his Pakistani family heritage at the heart of his leadership bid \u2013 appeared to have fallen into line with No 10 about the revised inquiry, telling the BBC: \u201cIt makes absolute sense to look at all types of prejudice.\u201d Warsi says Javid has faced a \u201chuge amount of pressure to pull back\u201d, adding: \u201cHe\u2019s chancellor of the exchequer. He\u2019s got the second or third most powerful role in government and he still doesn\u2019t feel like he can exercise power? I get this art of playing politics to get to a position where you\u2019re increasingly more powerful \u2026 but I think that politicians are so focused on amassing power that they forget about what they\u2019re amassing it for.\u201d But she is also sympathetic towards the chancellor, who has acknowledged a \u201cMuslim heritage\u201d but practises no religion. \u201cI think deep down he does genuinely care about this stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause if you take the definition of Islamophobia, it\u2019s not about religiosity or Islam or whether you\u2019re actually a Muslim, it\u2019s Muslimness or perceived Muslimness.\u201d Indeed, Javid\u2019s government has faced criticism for rejecting a working definition of Islamophobia along those lines set out by a cross-party report adopted by Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Scottish Conservatives. In a statement, Javid told the Guardian: \u201cI remember vividly being called a \u2018Paki bastard\u2019 in the school playground. Like Sayeeda, and so many others, I know what it\u2019s like to face prejudice \u2013 as a child, in the workplace and in politics. I pay tribute to all those calling out discrimination wherever they see it. We will only defeat racism by working together. We will investigate anti-Muslim hatred as part of an inquiry into all kinds of prejudice.\u201d Warsi thrust the issue of British Islamophobia into the spotlight in 2011, while serving in David Cameron\u2019s cabinet. This bigotry had, she said, \u201cpassed the dinner-table test\u201d and become widely acceptable. In 2015, by which time she had resigned from the cabinet because of the government\u2019s \u201cmorally indefensible\u201d stance on the Gaza crisis, she raised the issue of Islamophobia in the Conservatives. Late that year, she began informally contacting the party chairman\u2019s office about anti-Muslim hatred perpetrated by Conservatives on social media but says she encountered a \u201cbureaucracy wall\u201d. In October 2017, the Tory backbench MP Bob Blackman sparked outrage when he hosted Tapan Ghosh, an anti-Islamic extremist who once praised the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, as keynote speaker in parliament. In 2018, Warsi went public with a call for the Conservatives to hold an inquiry. Warsi, 48, the daughter of a Pakistani immigrant mill worker who later built a \u00a32m-a-year bed manufacturing company, makes it clear that campaigning has taken its toll. \u201cThere are times when you look out to beautiful greenery in peaceful Yorkshire when I think, I don\u2019t know why I bother with this any more.\u201d However, she says, \u201cI know that for the sake of the future I have to stay. I can\u2019t just say: \u2018Look, I\u2019ve had enough, see you later, bye bye.\u2019\u201d Asked if her party is pushing her away, she pauses before saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think it makes it easy for me to stay \u2026\u201d Has she seriously considered leaving the Tories? \u201cI\u2019ve considered leaving politics, not just the Conservative party. I\u2019ve considered walking away from Westminster, full stop.\u201d Over Islamophobia? \u201cOver generally the state of politics, the way in which politics is done \u2026 There are so many lies that are told, there\u2019s very little fact and logical reasoning. The general nastiness around the space.\u201d But Islamophobia has \u201cforced\u201d her back to the frontline. She has not been entirely alone in her battle. The former Conservative MEP Sajjad Karim says the party is in denial over the extent of Islamophobia and risks becoming the Brexit party \u201cin all but name\u201d. In 2013, he says he overheard two MPs, one of whom is a serving minister, \u201chaving an Islamophobic conversation about me and my religious and cultural background\u201d. He will not name the minister but says that, after going public, he was contacted by Conservative HQ and asked whether he would like to make a complaint using the standard procedure. He declined because of the \u201cdelicate\u201d nature of the complaint but said he would meet with the chairman, James Cleverly, \u201csetting out exactly what happened so that he can go away and deal with it\u201d. He says he never heard back. Karim, who was an MEP for 15 years before losing his seat earlier this year, doubts his former party colleagues\u2019 willingness to tackle \u2013 or even acknowledge \u2013 the problem. \u201cThey just see it as a nuisance. Those of us that are bringing it up and reminding them of this issue are just regarded as banging on about something that is damaging the party and not really an issue in itself.\u201d Warsi has also raised concerns about the views of senior government figures, warning earlier this year that she feared Michael Gove becoming prime minster because of his views on Muslims. Now she goes further, saying she has \u201cno doubt\u201d Gove \u2013 who wrote a controversial book in 2006 called Celsius 7/7 about Islamism in the UK \u2013 is Islamophobic. \u201cI think Michael\u2019s view is there is no such thing as a non-problematic Muslim. I think that in his world there\u2019s an extremist lurking behind anyone who professes to be connected to Islam or Muslims in any way shape or form,\u201d she explains. \u201cOn one occasion the prime minister, David [Cameron] pulled him up on it around the cabinet table for some comment that he made. He just turned around and went: \u2018Enough, Michael.\u2019 It was about Muslims.\u201d A spokesman for Gove calls these claims \u201ccategorically untrue\u201d. In relation to Johnson, who prompted outrage by writing last year that woman wearing burqas looked like \u201cletter boxes\u201d and argued in 2007 that Islam caused the Muslim world to be \u201cliterally centuries behind\u201d, she is more sympathetic, describing him as a \u201ccentre-ground, liberal Conservative\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s made stupid remarks and I think he thinks he\u2019s too clever by half. That\u2019s just part of that well-to-do white privilege that comes in certain spaces, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s pernicious \u2026 I don\u2019t think he\u2019s Islamophobic. I do not think he wants to go out and attack Muslims simply for being Muslim or wants to make life difficult for them. I genuinely don\u2019t believe that. He\u2019s no Michael Gove.\u201d Mohammed Amin, the former chairman of the Conservative Muslim Forum, who has also called for an independent inquiry, has been aware of extreme views in the party for decades. He joined the Tories in 1983, he says, \u201cbecause I believed in the economic ideology\u201d, despite \u201cknowing it was full of old white racists\u201d. He felt the party reached out to ethnic minority voters under Cameron\u2019s reign but that a turning point was reached in 2016 during the Tory London mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith\u2019s campaign. Afterwards, Amin spoke out in dismay at Goldsmith\u2019s efforts to smear Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan as a \u201ccloset extremist\u201d. Last year, Amin persuaded colleagues at the forum to back a call for an inquiry, arguing that it \u201ccouldn\u2019t simply be a silent bystander\u201d. In June, however, he was expelled from the forum after attacking Johnson\u2019s moral integrity during a Radio 4 interview in which he compared his popularity to Adolf Hitler\u2019s. When Johnson took over as leader, Amin resigned from the party and defected to the Lib Dems. He now describes Islamophobia in the Conservatives as a \u201cslow-motion disaster\u201d, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s an institutional problem inside the party about being transparent about anything, and that has seriously impaired its ability to get to grips with the Islamophobic problem \u2013 and to be seen to be getting to grips with it. And an unwillingness to really ask the question: what is it about the Conservative party that attracts these people?\u201d Earlier this month, Kyle Pedley, the deputy chair of Stourbridge Conservative Association in the West Midlands, resigned, feeling \u201caghast\u201d, after claiming he witnessed a Muslim man who was seeking to be chosen as a council candidate being interrogated about his religion by party officers during a selection meeting. He says the man was asked: \u201cAre you really a Muslim? Do you pray five times a day? How many times a year do you go to the mosque?\u201d The local chair denied any Islamophobia. Kishan Devani, a former Tory parliamentary candidate and deputy chair of the party in London, quit the Conservatives in late 2017 because he felt uncomfortable with a failure to deal with Islamophobia and because of what he saw as a lurch to the right. Devani, who is of a Hindu background, and is now standing as a parliamentary candidate for the Lib Dems in Wales, said: \u201cI heard of the way people were talked down, the way people were sidelined because of their race and their background and their religion. I thought, \u2018This is disgusting \u2013 this cannot be how people are treated.\u2019\u201d With the party\u2019s eyes fixed firmly on the election, there could be more trouble on the horizon for the Conservatives. In May, the Muslim Council of Britain filed a complaint to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), urging the watchdog to investigate Islamophobia in the Tory party. Since then, the Tories have submitted evidence and the EHRC \u2013 which is separately investigating Labour over antisemitism \u2013 says it is still considering whether any action is needed. Warsi, for one, feels there is more work to be done. She is sceptical about Johnson\u2019s motivation for broadening the inquiry, but says she would still get involved, revealing that a senior party official recently sounded her out about taking part. \u201cIf that\u2019s the only way to get scrutiny, I\u2019m not just going to sit back and have a monk [sulk] on, as they say in Yorkshire.\u201d But, she says firmly, she is \u201cnot prepared to rubber-stamp some nonsensical inquiry\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Regional divides in the UK are among the worst in the developed world, according to a report, which found that parts of England have higher mortality rates than places in Turkey, Romania and Poland. Research by the thinktank IPPR North found that the UK is more unequal than comparable countries on measures such as health, jobs, disposable income and productivity. It said mortality rates \u2013 the number of people who die relative to the size and age of the population \u2013 were worse in Blackpool, Manchester and Hull than in the Turkish cities of Tunceli, Mardin and Mu\u011fla, the Romanian region of V\u00e2lcea, and the cities of Krakow and Wroc\u0142aw in Poland. Luke Raikes, a senior research fellow at IPPR North, said: \u201cIt is no surprise that people across the country feel so disempowered. Both political and economic power are hoarded by a handful of people in London and the south-east and this has damaged all parts of the country, from Newcastle to Newham.\u201d The report, published on Wednesday, stresses that the inequality in Britain is far more complex than a north-south divide or \u201ccities versus towns\u201d, pointing to high levels of poverty in parts of inner-city London as well as the existence of affluent towns and stagnant cities. It said that by some measures, such as life satisfaction and the homicide rate, the UK was less divided than other developed countries. However the UK is \u201cconsistently more divided than any comparable country\u201d when it comes to vital topics such as productivity, income, unemployment, health and politics, the research found. In terms of productivity, which economists believe is vital for economic growth and raising living standards, the UK is the most regionally divided country of its size and level of development and has not improved for a decade. The only countries that are more regionally unequal in productivity are very different in other ways, the report said, such as many eastern Europe economies that are far smaller than the UK. Raikes, who authored the report, said the divide in terms of disposable income had grown in the UK in recent years, with an average \u00a348,000 per person gap between those living in the wealthiest areas and those in the most deprived. On this measure, the UK is more regionally divided than any other country of its size and development \u2013 such as Germany, Spain and Italy \u2013 and is second only to Israel, a country with the population of London, in terms of inequality of disposable income between richest and poorest. IPPR North, along with political leaders from across the spectrum in the north of England and in the Midlands, have long called for further devolution of powers and funding in order to shrink the UK\u2019s productivity gap and address its regional divides. IPPR\u2019s annual report State of the North pointed out that the north of England\u2019s economy is larger than the economies of most EU countries yet was being held back by Whitehall and Westminster, describing Britain as \u201cthe most centralised country of its size in the developed world\u201d. Arianna Giovannini, the interim director of IPPR North, said 2019 had \u201cexposed our country\u2019s regional divides\u201d and that economic uncertainty had permeated every corner of the UK as the Brexit debate raged in Westminster. She added: \u201cBut 2019 also showed the great promise of devolution. Mayors in the north have shown what\u2019s possible, despite the limited amount of devolved power they currently have.
