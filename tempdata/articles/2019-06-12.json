      "bodyText": "Have MPs missed their last chance to block a no-deal Brexit? Not quite. Labour seized the opportunity for action on Wednesday because they had been allotted an opposition day debate \u2013 an opportunity to decide what MPs discuss and vote on. They may not get another such day in this parliamentary session; and without that, or any looming legislation they can try to amend, there may be few parliamentary moments when concerned MPs can try to bind the hands of the next prime minister. Does the result mean there\u2019s now no majority against a no-deal Brexit? It was certainly a relatively comfortable victory for the government: a majority of 11, compared with its defeat on the Cooper-Letwin bill, which passed by one vote in April. But Labour conceded even before the vote that it is always harder to persuade Conservative MPs to back a motion tabled in the name of Jeremy Corbyn, as this one was, rather than a backbench-led initiative. And the timing, in the middle of the Tory leadership contest, was also tricky. Many Conservative MPs may have felt any new leader deserves the opportunity to try to pursue their own Brexit plan first, before parliament starts trying to tie their hands. Could we still leave the EU with a deal? Yes \u2013 and Boris Johnson, the leading candidate to be Britain\u2019s next prime minister, has said that\u2019s his aim. He has declined to say what he will do if he is unable to secure the concessions he plans to demand from Brussels \u2013 but has insisted we must leave on 31 October, with or without a deal. So how could no deal be stopped? It looks as though the only remaining option is likely to be the most explosive one \u2013 bringing down the government. The Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve made clear in the course of the debate that he would be prepared to vote against his party in a no-confidence motion, if a future prime minister were to try to take Britain out of the EU without a deal. \u201cIf we get to a point where a prime minister is intent on doing this [taking the UK out of the EU without a deal], the only way of stopping that prime minister would be to bring down that prime minister\u2019s government. And I simply have to say here and now I will not hesitate to do that if that is what is attempted, even if it means my resigning the whip and leaving the party,\u201d he said. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has hinted he might also be prepared to do the same thing. With the Conservatives\u2019 majority wafer-thin, Grieve and Hammond would not need to be joined by many others to bring down the government. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, if a government loses a no-confidence vote, alternative leaders have a fortnight to try to assemble a parliamentary majority \u2013 and if they are unable to do so, a general election must be called. Whether that would resolve the Brexit impasse, it is impossible to say.",

Asked how he differed from Johnson, Javid said: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m a change candidate. Boris Johnson is yesterday\u2019s news. </p> \n   <p>He\u2019s been around in politics for a while, he\u2019s achieved a lot, he\u2019s still got a big role to play, but I think if we are trying to connect with the next generation and move forward as a country then I think it\u2019s time for the next generation with a bold new agenda. </p> \n   <p>What I can do in terms of the policies, I think being able to articulate the policies, it\u2019s not just about articulating that core message \u2013 I think the messenger makes a real difference as well.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Javid claimed his background as a leading international banker gave him the experience needed to deliver a Brexit deal.</strong> Asked how he would be able to agree a deal, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When I look at my own experience of doing deals \u2013 big international deals in the 19, 20-year career I had before I came into politics \u2013 I started at the bottom of the finance industry and finished towards the top, and that was because I built a reputation of doing many multibillion-dollar deals, including some of the largest financing and bond transactions the world had ever seen. And they weren\u2019t easy. They weren\u2019t straightforward. They were all involving negotiation, involving competition to win the deals.</p> \n   <p>So, while I think no one has got perfect experience to deliver Brexit because no one has done anything like it before, I think with that experience that I\u2019ve got outside government and the experience I\u2019ve got in government \u2026 I think I\u2019m in a very good position to get a good Brexit deal for the United Kingdom.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/12/keir-starmer-urges-mps-to-back-safety-valve-to-stop-no-deal-brexit\">Conservative leadership candidates including Boris Johnson hoping to force through a \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d Brexit in October have been handed a boost after MPs defeated a Labour-led attempt to begin legislation to stop the UK leaving the EU without an agreement.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/12/brexit-delay-means-defeat-boris-johnson-launches-campaign\">Boris Johnson has launched his Tory leadership campaign by insisting he does not wish to pursue a no-deal Brexit, but would prepare \u201cvigorously and seriously\u201d to leave the EU without an agreement in October, saying the survival of the Conservative party depended on it.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/12/boris-johnson-brexit-plan-ifficult-or-impossible-hammond\">Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan is impossible as the UK will not be able to leave the EU with a deal or without a deal by the end of October, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, has said.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/12/esther-mcvey-expensed-thousands-of-pounds-for-personal-photographer\">The Conservative leadership hopeful Esther McVey has spent thousands of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money claiming for a personal photographer on expenses.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s all from me for tonight.</p> \n  <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b02e13bb8d0f5f72a32f88054f01c9cd4ce0bff\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b02e13bb8d0f5f72a32f88054f01c9cd4ce0bff/0_15_3729_2237/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sajid Javid and his wife Laura\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sajid Javid and his wife, Laura, at his leadership campaign launch.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Veysey/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-12T18:16:09.497Z\">at 7.16pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d01157f8f08b4ffd649686c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-12T17:43:33.681Z\">6.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Brexit party at 'high risk' of accepting impermissible donations, says Electoral Commission</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Turning away from the debate, the <strong>Electoral Commission</strong> has said that Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party is at a \u201chigh and ongoing risk\u201d of accepting impermissible donations.

We have concluded that the fundraising structure adopted by the party leaves it open to a high and ongoing risk of receiving and accepting impermissible donations. We have made recommendations that will, if implemented by the party, achieve and maintain robust procedures for receiving funds and help it comply with its legal requirements.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In response, the Brexit party said the commission had confirmed its method of fundraising was legitimate and had been adopted by other political parties and campaigners. It went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>They haven\u2019t found any examples of infringement of Electoral Commission rules</p> \n   <p>However, we are grateful that they have made some helpful suggestions to reduce future risk as we fundraise and we will be working to embrace those recommendations as soon as practicable and possible and in the time frame set out. </p> \n   <p>We trust that the Electoral Commission have been applying the same oversight and rigour to the other political parties and their fund-raising.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d0136358f08f9f29d32da68\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-12T17:35:57.948Z\">6.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sajid Javid's campaign launch \u2013 verdict from Twitter commentariat</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is what political journalists and commentators are saying on Twitter about the Sajid Javid campaign launch.</p> \n  <p>From the Financial Times\u2019<strong> Robert Shrimsley</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/robertshrimsley/status/1138856391026851841\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As these things go, Javid was pretty good.

Sajid Javid was the last of the 10 Tory leadership contenders on the ballot tomorrow to hold his formal campaign launch, and it was definitely one of the best \u2013 and probably the one that most surpassed expectations. It may be too late, but this did feel like an event that might persuade a sceptical selectorate (<a href=\"https://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2019/06/leadership-election-candidate-support-numbers-hunt-27-johnson-19-raab-13-gove-12-javid-10.html\">in terms of declared MP supporters</a>, Javid is struggling) to think again.</p> \n  <p>Javid\u2019s personal story is well known and he spoken many times before about how he was brought up by immigrant parents who were poor but who were hardworking and loving. In the past, particularly when he first got a cabinet job, he was seen as a wooden speaker devoid of charisma. You would not say that about him today, and this speech, in terms of emotional reach, was probably the best he\u2019s ever given. More importantly, he managed to connect his own experience to the plight of the Conservative party and its need to sound less privileged, and his argument \u2013 particularly the line about how the Scottish Tories are winning votes because they \u201cthrew out central casting and they elected someone totally different [Ruth Davidson]\u201d \u2013 was a persuasive one. His policy offerings were routine and his Brexit solution sounded even more fanciful than most of the others in this contest. But in most elections, it is easier being the change candidate than the status quo candidate, and Javid convincingly presented himself as the most changey person on the ticket.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"475cbbc6f386b80034208b7d331d1a2e3e510740\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/475cbbc6f386b80034208b7d331d1a2e3e510740/0_144_4898_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sajid Javid\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sajid Javid at his leadership launch.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Veysey/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-12T18:19:47.498Z\">at 7.19pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d012a7e8f08b4ffd64969f5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-12T16:40:08.979Z\">5.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: When did you decide that Theresa May had cut police numbers too far?</em></p> \n  <p>Javid says that even before he became home secretary, he was concerned the cuts had gone too far.</p> \n  <p>But he was bound by collective responsibility, he says.

A colleague will be looking at the truth of this proposition shortly (and it was striking how Johnson had almost nothing to say about his record as foreign secretary), but this fitted in quite well with what now seems to be the Johnson campaign USP: the claim that he is the unity candidate, acceptable to all wings of the party. Tory MPs and members will not have been particularly surprised by any of this, but it probably did the job, and his passage about how beating Ken Livingstone taught him how to beat Jeremy Corbyn may have struck a chord. Overall, the most impressive thing about the event was probably the large and diverse crowd of Tory MPs who turned up.</p> \n  <p>On policy, he has almost nothing to say at all. In fact, even Rory Stewart\u2019s new age sermon last night probably contained more in in the way of specific commitments. Johnson seems quite happy to make policy through the pages of the Daily Telegraph, but curiously reluctant to discuss it in public. It remains to be seen whether or not this will change as the campaign goes on. Many observers will see this as a weakness, although arguably micro-policy is overrated in a leadership election, which is a test of character. (I remember thinking Yvette Cooper\u2019s campaign was doomed in 2015 when I heard her mulling over whether to accept some minor benefit policy proposal, or whether just to \u201coffer a review\u201d, at an event where what was needed was big picture vision.)</p> \n  <p>Johnson got through the questions without major mishap, although at times his evasiveness was particularly transparent. Faced with a question about his cocaine use (and there are legitimate questions about why this issue is damaging Michael Gove more than Johnson), he just waffled. And he got even more circumlocutory when my colleague Heather Stewart asked if he would resign if he could not deliver Brexit by 31 October. His newfound friends in the ERG will have noted he did not say yes.</p> \n  <p>Johnson was no better than any of the other candidates have been (with the exceptions of Stewart and Mark Harper, who have been a bit more candid) when it came to explaining how he would deliver Brexit. His account of how the vote to leave was partly a protest vote from people who felt ignored by Westminster sounded just like Theresa May circa autumn 2016. At one point, in his waffly answer to Heather, Johnson even started sounding like a pro-European. But the most revealing thing was when he said he was looking forward to the moment when Brexit was no longer a headline issue. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/12/tory-leadership-boris-johnson-facing-fierce-criticism-because-of-his-huge-appeal-says-leading-supporter--live-news?page=with:block-5d00d1028f08b4ffd649645b#block-5d00d1028f08b4ffd649645b\">11.18am.) </a>Given how badly it has all gone, it is no surprise that one of the key architects of this crisis is keen to talk about something else.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e4d142b9e9ec3200ba0997db91b11194bd8e521\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e4d142b9e9ec3200ba0997db91b11194bd8e521/0_236_3279_1967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson at the launch of his campaign for the Tory leadership.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson at the launch of his campaign for the Tory leadership.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-12T13:38:50.954Z\">at 2.38pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d00d8e48f08f9f29d32d475\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-12T10:52:24.690Z\">11.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The press conference is now over.

      "bodyText": "Sajid Javid, the home secretary, has depicted himself as the change candidate in the Conservative leadership election, dismissing Boris Johnson, the favourite, as \u201cyesterday\u2019s news\u201d. At a launch event where he stressed his upbringing as the son of immigrant parents, and the contrast with his more privileged rivals, he said the Tories needed a \u201cnew kind of leadership from new kind of leader\u201d. Asked how he differed from Johnson, Javid said: I\u2019m a change candidate. Boris Johnson is yesterday\u2019s news. He\u2019s been around in politics for a while, he\u2019s achieved a lot, he\u2019s still got a big role to play, but I think if we are trying to connect with the next generation and move forward as a country then I think it\u2019s time for the next generation with a bold new agenda. What I can do in terms of the policies, I think being able to articulate the policies, it\u2019s not just about articulating that core message \u2013 I think the messenger makes a real difference as well. Javid claimed his background as a leading international banker gave him the experience needed to deliver a Brexit deal. Asked how he would be able to agree a deal, he said: When I look at my own experience of doing deals \u2013 big international deals in the 19, 20-year career I had before I came into politics \u2013 I started at the bottom of the finance industry and finished towards the top, and that was because I built a reputation of doing many multibillion-dollar deals, including some of the largest financing and bond transactions the world had ever seen. And they weren\u2019t easy. They weren\u2019t straightforward. They were all involving negotiation, involving competition to win the deals. So, while I think no one has got perfect experience to deliver Brexit because no one has done anything like it before, I think with that experience that I\u2019ve got outside government and the experience I\u2019ve got in government \u2026 I think I\u2019m in a very good position to get a good Brexit deal for the United Kingdom. Conservative leadership candidates including Boris Johnson hoping to force through a \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d Brexit in October have been handed a boost after MPs defeated a Labour-led attempt to begin legislation to stop the UK leaving the EU without an agreement. Boris Johnson has launched his Tory leadership campaign by insisting he does not wish to pursue a no-deal Brexit, but would prepare \u201cvigorously and seriously\u201d to leave the EU without an agreement in October, saying the survival of the Conservative party depended on it. Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan is impossible as the UK will not be able to leave the EU with a deal or without a deal by the end of October, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, has said. The Conservative leadership hopeful Esther McVey has spent thousands of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money claiming for a personal photographer on expenses. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Turning away from the debate, the Electoral Commission has said that Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party is at a \u201chigh and ongoing risk\u201d of accepting impermissible donations. As the Press Association reports, the commission said the party\u2019s system of using its online platform for donors to contribute small sums created \u201cadditional risk\u201d in relation to compliance with the laws on political funding. In a statement it said: The Electoral Commission visited the Brexit party on Tuesday 21 May to review the systems it has in place to receive funds. We have concluded that the fundraising structure adopted by the party leaves it open to a high and ongoing risk of receiving and accepting impermissible donations. We have made recommendations that will, if implemented by the party, achieve and maintain robust procedures for receiving funds and help it comply with its legal requirements. In response, the Brexit party said the commission had confirmed its method of fundraising was legitimate and had been adopted by other political parties and campaigners. It went on: They haven\u2019t found any examples of infringement of Electoral Commission rules However, we are grateful that they have made some helpful suggestions to reduce future risk as we fundraise and we will be working to embrace those recommendations as soon as practicable and possible and in the time frame set out. We trust that the Electoral Commission have been applying the same oversight and rigour to the other political parties and their fund-raising. This is what political journalists and commentators are saying on Twitter about the Sajid Javid campaign launch. From the Financial Times\u2019 Robert Shrimsley From the Guardian\u2019s Peter Walker From the FT\u2019s Sebastian Payne From the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith From my colleague Gaby Hinsliff From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby From the Independent\u2019s Jane Merrick Back to the no-deal vote earlier, and here is the Commons division list showing the MPs who backed the cross-party motion. They included 10 Conservatives who were defying the government whip: Guto Bebb (Aberconwy), Kenneth Clarke (Rushcliffe), Jonathan Djanogly (Huntingdon), Justine Greening (Putney), Dominic Grieve (Beaconsfield), Sam Gyimah (East Surrey), Phillip Lee (Bracknell), Oliver Letwin (West Dorset), Antoinette Sandbach (Eddisbury), Caroline Spelman (Meriden). And here is the list of MPs who voted against. They included eight Labour MPs who were defying the whip: Kevin Barron (Rother Valley), Ronnie Campbell (Blyth Valley), Jim Fitzpatrick (Poplar and Limehouse), Caroline Flint (Don Valley), Stephen Hepburn (Jarrow), Kate Hoey (Vauxhall), John Mann (Bassetlaw), Graham Stringer (Blackley and Broughton). People who give presentations for a living will tell you it is always best to be the first person to make a sales pitch to the customers or the last, because these are the ones people tend to remember. Sajid Javid was the last of the 10 Tory leadership contenders on the ballot tomorrow to hold his formal campaign launch, and it was definitely one of the best \u2013 and probably the one that most surpassed expectations. It may be too late, but this did feel like an event that might persuade a sceptical selectorate (in terms of declared MP supporters, Javid is struggling) to think again. Javid\u2019s personal story is well known and he spoken many times before about how he was brought up by immigrant parents who were poor but who were hardworking and loving. In the past, particularly when he first got a cabinet job, he was seen as a wooden speaker devoid of charisma. You would not say that about him today, and this speech, in terms of emotional reach, was probably the best he\u2019s ever given. More importantly, he managed to connect his own experience to the plight of the Conservative party and its need to sound less privileged, and his argument \u2013 particularly the line about how the Scottish Tories are winning votes because they \u201cthrew out central casting and they elected someone totally different [Ruth Davidson]\u201d \u2013 was a persuasive one. His policy offerings were routine and his Brexit solution sounded even more fanciful than most of the others in this contest. But in most elections, it is easier being the change candidate than the status quo candidate, and Javid convincingly presented himself as the most changey person on the ticket. Q: When did you decide that Theresa May had cut police numbers too far? Javid says that even before he became home secretary, he was concerned the cuts had gone too far. But he was bound by collective responsibility, he says. He says that was right. But he is speaking out now because he is running for leader, and people need to know what he would and would not do, he says. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Javid has now taken questions from all the journalists on the list he had of news organisations he was planning to call. He says he will take questions from others in the room. Someone who is head of private wealth at a law firm asks what he would do to stop members of the armed forces being prosecuted for historical allegations. Javid says he is not happy with the current situation. He would ask his attorney general as a priority to stop these sorts of cases. Q: Are you worried your campaign has started too slowly? Javid says he is happy with the way it is going, although he is worried his dog Bailey (which features in Javid\u2019s video) is becoming more popular than he is. Q: Do the Tories have a problem with Islamophobia? Javid says he thinks there is a growing problem with Islamophobia in society at large. He does not think the Conservatives have a particular problem. But people should speak out if they hear something objectionable, he says. He says he would be happy for an organisation to come in and look at the party\u2019s record. Q: Why do you think you could get the EU to offer a Brexit deal? Javid says having a new team will make a difference. There have been reports that the EU will be more flexible. He says he started in the City at the bottom. He ended up near the top. He spent his career doing deals, doing some of the biggest bond trades in the world. Q: Would you appoint someone who has taken class A drugs as home secretary? Javid says that is a reference to his good friend Michael Gove. He says Gove is big enough himself to defend his record. Q: Do you regret depriving Shamima Begum of her citizenship? Javid says he cannot comment on individual cases such as this. But he says as home secretary, his priority is to keep the country safe. And he says, when he receives advice from security officials, people would expect him to take it. Javid says he would not push to change abortion laws. Q: What are the main differences between you and the favourite, Boris Johnson? Javid says he is a change candidate. Boris Johnson is yesterday\u2019s news. He\u2019s been around in politics for a while. Javid says his life experience is different. He can connect with 90% of the country. Javid starts by taking a question from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby. And he says she does not need to worry about anyone booing her for doing her job. That is a reference to what MPs supporting Boris Johnson were doing at this morning\u2019s event. Javid\u2019s comment goes down very well with journalists. Q: Are you worried the Tories are turning into the \u2018nasty party\u2019? Javid says he is worried about politicians \u201caround the world\u201d promoting division. (That seems to be a reference to Donald Trump.) And he claims Jeremy Corbyn is already pursuing divisive politics. He wants to bring people together, he says. Q: Are you saying Boris Johnson is like Trump? Javid says of course we need vigorous debate. But he wants to bring people together. Javid says it is almost two centuries since Benjamin Disraeli coined the concept of one-nation conservatism. It is no coincidence he was an outsider (Disraeli was Jewish). Now it is time for another outsider to revive the party. Javid\u2019s family came here for freedom and prosperity. He has always been an optimist. And he feels an obligation to his family to secure the country\u2019s future, so it remains a beacon. Javid says he wants to see more police on the streets. And he wants to continue investing in the NHS. He says he has a supportive family. The government must support families in everything it does, he says. Javid says the UK needs world-class public services. It needs fiscal responsibility \u2013 keeping debt going down. And it needs a more balanced economy and investment in the whole of the UK. He says people argue we should not obsess so much about growth. But he does care about growth. That guarantees people can have jobs and public services. Public services were a lifeline for him, he says. Services such as the NHS are \u201cthe beating heart of our country\u201d and they deserve a prime minister who believes in them. Javid says the Tories won\u2019t deliver on the referendum result just by leaving the EU. The vote to leave was not only a critique of the EU system, but of the Westminster system too. He says the Conservatives have lost their competence and their confidence. The Tories need to take on the elites and the cartels, in the public and private sectors, he says. The problem with the Westminster elite is they have always been insiders. He does not blame them for that. But it was not connections that got him where he is today; it was public service, hard work and family. Javid says his experience, dealing with issues such as Grenfell Tower and Windrush, has humbled him greatly. He says the Conservative party should not be doubling down on divisions. We are at a crossroads, he says, and need to stop the country going in the wrong direction. Sajid Javid says the Tories need \u201ca new kind of leadership from a new kind of leader\u201d. The Conservatives have been in power for almost a decade. They will face a fourth general election. But they have won only one majority in the past quarter of a century, and they only won that narrowly. Javid says the Tories need to extend their appeal: \u201cWe need tomorrow\u2019s leader today.\u201d Javid says he has a positive plan for Brexit. And he says he can keep Jeremy Corbyn away from Brexit. Delivering Brexit is only a first step, he says. It will not be enough for the Tories to win a majority. It might surprise some people in Westminster, but most people in this country don\u2019t just talk about Brexit. Javid says people want to hear the Tories talk about other things. And he knows this can happen \u2013 because it has happened in Scotland. The Tories used to do so badly in Scotland that people joked about there being more pandas there than Tory MPs. But then the party threw out candidates from central casting, and elected Ruth Davidson (a young, blunt-speaking lesbian). Since then, the party has been gaining support in Scotland. Sajid Javid is speaking now. He says he is used to being told he is different. As a child, he remembers being advised by friends they had to walk home a different route because they were being threatened. His friends went abroad on holidays. He went to Rochdale, but his friends did not realise, because it looked like he had a tan. Javid says he has been constantly told options are not for him \u2013 going to university, going into banking, going into Conservative politics. And when he wanted to marry a white Christian, there were people in his wider community who said he should not, and that his children would be half-caste. But he did marry and his children would not even recognise the term. They are part of modern Britain. Javid says he is used to being told what he can\u2019t do. But he is more interested in what people can do. He says the fact he can put himself forward as a candidate shows the strength of his party. The Sajid Javid campaign launch is getting under way. It was held up because of the Commons vote. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, is introducing him. She has recently had a baby and she says there is not much that would get her to leave her child. But she has come from Edinburgh to London to introduce him because she is such an admirer. She says they first met when Javid beat her in the contest to be selected as the candidate for Bromsgrove 10 years ago. She says he has shown energy and dynamism in all the government jobs he has had. She says the Tories are struggling to speak to great swathes of the country. But she says Javid understands people\u2019s concerns because he has lived them. The Conservatives have always done well with a leader brought up above the shop, she says. The pound has fallen to its lowest level of the day against the US dollar, suggesting City traders think the risk of a no-deal Brexit has risen. Sterling just dropped by one-third of a cent to $1.269, the lowest level since early yesterday morning The government has won by 309 votes to 298 - a majority of 11. That means the motion has been defeated, and MPs won\u2019t get control of Commons business on Tuesday 25 June to enable them to pass legislation blocking a no-deal Brexit. Here is an extract from Dominic Grieve\u2019s speech, the highlight of the debate. If we get to a point where a prime minister is intent on doing this [taking the UK out of the EU without a deal], the only way of stopping that prime minister would be to bring down that prime minister\u2019s government. And I simply have to say here and now I will not hesitate to do that if that is what is attempted, even if it means my resigning the whip and leaving the party. I will not allow this country to be taken out of the EU on a no-deal Brexit without the approval of this house, in my view going back to the country and asking them if that is what they want. So me, desiring the best for my party, as a loyal member of it, as far as I\u2019m concerned, this is probably the last opportunity to have a sensible way of influencing the outcome ... I was elected as member of parliament for Beaconsfield to represent my constituents\u2019 interests. No-deal is not in their interests, and nor is there the smallest shred of evidence that there is some majority for this appalling and chaotic proposal. Yet I have to face up to the fact that there are some people who wish to lead my party who appear to believe that it is a viable option, and indeed that they can\u2019t become leaders of my party without it being an option that they are prepared to put forward \u2013 all part of the process, I\u2019m afraid, of further deceit which is slowly swallowing up the democracy of this country and the reputation of this house. So, I simply say this; I shall support the motion. I disagree on most things with [Jeremy Corbyn], I disagree fundamentally with every tenet of his philosophical outlook. But I have to say it is the only opportunity we\u2019ve got. And I\u2019m not going to spend my time talking to children or grandchildren later on saying, \u2018When it came to it, I just decided to give up.\u2019 I won\u2019t do that. From Tony Grew\u2019s @PARLYapp Nick Brown, the Labour chief whip, intervenes to propose that the vote be held now. MPs are voting. Here, for reference, is the text of the motion. Business of the House Motion (United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union) (1) That, on Tuesday 25 June \u2013 (a) standing order no. 14(1) (which provides that government business shall have precedence at every sitting save as provided in that order) shall not apply; (b) precedence shall be given to a motion relating to the business of the house in connection with matters relating to the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union; (c) if more than one motion relating to the business of the house is tabled, the Speaker shall decide which motion shall have precedence; (d) the Speaker shall interrupt proceedings on any business having precedence before the business of the house motion at 1.00 pm and call a member to move that motion; (e) debate on that motion may continue until 2.00 pm at which time the Speaker shall put the questions necessary to dispose of proceedings on that motion including the questions on amendments selected by the Speaker which may then be moved; (f) any proceedings interrupted or superseded by this order may be resumed or (as the case may be) entered upon and proceeded with after the moment of interruption. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle is speaking now. She says MPs have to stop a new PM acting like a \u201clatter-day Charles I\u201d and suspending parliament to facilitate no-deal. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general and a leading pro-European in his party, says Stephen Barclay\u2019s speech was full of \u201cobfuscatory facts\u201d obscuring the reality, which is that if this motion does not pass, a new prime minister will be able to stop MPs voting to block no-deal before 31 October. He says, if the motion were to fail, then the only option would be to bring down the government with a vote of no confidence. But he says he would not hesitate to do so to stop a no-deal Brexit. He would have to resign the whip, he says. He says he considers himself a loyal Conservative. But he is dismayed that some of his colleagues think no-deal Brexit would be acceptable. It would not be, he says. He says he is not willing to face the prospect of having to tell his grandchildren that, faced with the prospect of no deal, he just gave up. Gareth Snell, one of the more pro-Brexit MPs on the Labour benches, is speaking in the debate now. He says he regrets not voting for the deal in the last Commons vote in March. If someone can bring a deal to the house, he will vote for it, he says. He says if Labour MPs do not vote for a deal they will be responsible for a no-deal Brexit by default. The fact is there is a deal. It is not a great deal. But it is what we are presented with ... We can only make decisions on what we are presented with. Cash says it would be wrong for MPs to pass legislation to block a no-deal Brexit because, by doing so, they would be abrogating the decision taken when they said the public at large should determine whether or not the UK should remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter, is speaking in the debate now. He says this is \u201can open door\u201d motion. It opens the door for any bill on Tuesday 25 June. He says this is an attempt by Labour, not just to disrupt the Tory leadership contest, but to reverse Brexit. Nick Boles, the former Conservative who now sits as an independent, says a no-deal Brexit would lead to the decimation of lamb imports and the destruction of jobs in manufacturing. Those should be reasons enough to back the motion, he says. In the debate, Sir Oliver Letwin, the Tory former cabinet minister who is backing the cross-party motion, says a government would not have to prorogue parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. A new prime minister could avoid MPs amending any legislation to block a no-deal departure just by not scheduling any votes. Letwin says people think 31 October is a long time away. But if MPs do not establish a process now to give themselves a mechanism to block a no-deal Brexit, there will not be time later. MPs are away in August, and then the Commons will only sit for two weeks in September, and for two weeks in October. If we do not take the fuse out now, we will not be able to disassemble the bomb in either September or October. He says he has taken the \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d step of signing a motion tabled by Jeremy Corbyn, whose policies he profoundly disagrees with, because he does not want a no-deal Brexit on his conscience. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, was due to be holding his leadership launch at 3.30pm. But that has been held up because the no-deal debate is still running. Javid has to be in the Commons to vote, and the division is not due until 4pm, or later. Back in the Commons, Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, is speaking now. He says that if the Conservatives were in opposition, they would be supporting this motion. When David Cameron was in opposition, he favoured the idea of control of Commons business being handed over to a business committee, he says. Turning back to the Tory leadership, Boris Johnson was keen to present himself earlier as the candidate best able to unite the Conservative party. (See 11.12am, 12.26pm and 3.08pm.) But this claim has been undermined by new evidence published by the academic Tim Bale, a specialist in party membership, showing Conservative members who are backing Johnson for the leadership are more rightwing than those supporting Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt, and more rightwing than the average for a Tory member. In an article for the Conversation, Bale says his analysis, based on survey data from YouGov, also shows Johnson supporters are significantly more in favour of a no-deal Brexit than the average for Conservative members (quite a feat \u2013 overall 66% of members are in favour of no-deal; among Johnson supporters, this rises to 85%). Johnson supporters are also more likely to want less emphasis on climate change than Tory members on average. Bale says Johnson\u2019s backers are also more likely to have joined the party after the 2016 referendum. Bale concludes: We can only guess as to how many of Johnson\u2019s supporters were former Ukip sympathisers switching to the Tories, but it certainly seems possible. And, who knows, given that one doesn\u2019t have to renounce one\u2019s membership of the Conservative party to become a registered supporter of the Brexit party, perhaps some of them hold a candle for Nigel Farage as well as Johnson. Whether the country will be as pleased as they will be if Johnson does end up making it all the way to No 10, however, remains to be seen. Leave.EU, the pro-Brexit group co-founded by Arron Banks, has been encouraging Brexiters, like former Ukip supporters, to join the Conservative party to influence its decisions. It called the campaign Blue Wave. It is hard to know what effect this has had, but the Bale research suggests Brexiter entryism is having some impact. The SNP\u2019s Peter Grant is speaking now in the debate. He says that in other parliaments, such as Holyrood, parliament decides on its own business, not the executive. That seems to work perfectly well, he says. Anna Soubry raises a point of order. She says this debate was meant to be lasting an hour, but there are only 20 minutes left. Will other MPs get to speak? John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, says that although the debate was listed for an hour, it could run until 8.33pm. He does not expect it to run for that long, he says. But he expects several other MPs to speak. Back in the debate, the Change UK MP Anna Soubry asks Barclay if the government thinks it would be acceptable for a prime minister to prorogue parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. Barclay says this prime minister has been clear about her opposition to that. Proroguing parliament would involve the Queen (she prorogues parliament, on the advice of her government), and it would be wrong to involve her in an issue such as this, Barclay says. Turning back to the Tory leadership, this is the tweet Boris Johnson has posted about his launch today. Johnson is trying here to show he has support from both sides of the party. One picture features backers from the centrist/remain wing (Chloe Smith, James Brokenshire and Grant Shapps) and another features Brexiter rightwingers from a different faction (Iain Duncan Smith, Priti Patel and Nadine Dorries). In the debate, Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, is now speaking for the government. He says Labour frequently objects to the concept of a \u201cblind Brexit\u201d. But this is a blind motion. It does not say what would happen on Tuesday 25 June, the day that would be set aside for a bill to be passed trying to block a no-deal Brexit. UPDATE: Here is a clip. John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, interrupts the debate to announce the results of an election for the chair of the Northern Ireland affairs committee. The Conservative Simon Hoare has been elected. He replaces Andrew Murrison, who has recently been made a minister. Starmer says this move is about allowing MPs a \u201csafety valve\u201d. He urges all MPs to back the motion. Here is Catherine Haddon from the Institute for Government on the debate. Starmer says he accepts he is using an unusual device to try to block a no-deal Brexit. John Baron, a Tory Brexiter, says that if the motion is passed, the government will not be able to control the business of the house. And if it cannot do that, it cannot deliver its manifesto promises, and democracy breaks down. Starmer says, if the government cannot control the business, it should go. Back in the debate, Keir Starmer says his staff tried to find out more about Dominic Raab\u2019s Brexit plan. But, he says, when they tried to log on to Raab\u2019s Tory leadership campaign website, a message come up saying it could not be accessed because it belonged to a category blocked by parliament. Turning away from the debate, this is from my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels. Starmer says that although Theresa May originally said she would be willing to contemplate a no-deal Brexit, she eventually concluded that was not acceptable. He says he thinks she decided the threat it would post to national security was too severe. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is opening the debate on the cross-party motion designed to give MPs the chance to pass legislation aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit. (We published details of the plan here and the text of the motion here.) Starmer says this move has the support of the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Greens and the Conservative MP Oliver Letwin. He says the Tory leadership candidate Rory Stewart also seemed to back it last night, until he withdraw his support \u2013 presumably after a call from the chief whip, says Starmer says. As Boris Johnson made his first public pitch to Tory MPs in front of the media, the European commission published a warning to businesses in which it cited political instability in Britain as a major threat to hopes the UK will leave the EU smoothly with a deal. The commission\u2019s report on the bloc\u2019s preparedness, published almost exactly as Johnson stood up to speak, claimed: The continued uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement \u2026 and the overall domestic political situation means a \u2018no-deal\u2019 scenario on 1 November 2019 very much remains a possible \u2013 although undesirable \u2013 outcome. The commission reiterated that it would not countenance a \u201cmanaged no-deal Brexit\u201d, and that the bare bones contingency measures in place to ensure basic connectivity in areas such as aviation and haulage for up to nine months after the UK crashes out would not be supplemented. \u201cThere will be no transition period, as provided for in the withdrawal agreement,\u201d the commission said. This will obviously cause significant disruption for citizens and businesses and would have a serious negative economic impact, which would be proportionally much greater in the United Kingdom than in the EU27 member states. The commission said it was confident European businesses were as prepared as possible for Brexit on 31 October, in contrast to the apparent state of readiness in the UK. An official note to the British cabinet leaked to the Financial Times claimed the government needed a further six to eight months of engagement with the pharmaceuticals industry \u201cto ensure adequate arrangements are in place to build stockpiles of medicines by 31 October\u201d. The note added that the government would need \u201cat least 4-5 months\u201d to improve trader readiness for the new border checks that would be enforced in the event of the UK leaving on Halloween without an agreement with the EU. This is from Rory Stewart, one of Boris Johnson\u2019s rivals for the Tory leadership. Given that Stewart has actually tweeted this, it does not say a lot for his self-control ... A no-deal Brexit would be \u201ccommercial suicide\u201d, with tens of thousands of jobs already lost in the UK because of political uncertainty, manufacturing representatives have said. As Boris Johnson was launching his campaign for the Tory leadership, industry representatives were telling MPs crashing out of the bloc was \u201ceconomic vandalism\u201d. Seamus Nevin, the chief economist at Make UK, which represents some of the country\u2019s largest manufacturers, said: There is a direct link between politicians talking up the prospect of no deal and British firms losing customers overseas and British people losing jobs. He told the Brexit select committee that some businesses were already \u201cdownsizing or completely shutting down in the UK\u201d. Some were very profitable and leaders in their sector, but were struggling because of the political uncertainty. Nevin said he was aware of one company, which he could not name because of a confidentiality agreement, that was planning to leave the UK. \u201cThat will result in several thousand job losses,\u201d he said, adding that a no-deal Brexit \u201cwould be nothing short of an act of economic vandalism\u201d and \u201cundo 25 years of economic progress and consign a generation of highly skilled workers to the scrapheap.\u201d This is what the Press Association has filed on the Theresa May/Jeremy Corbyn exchanges from PMQs. Theresa May was urged to remind her potential successors of the dangers of a no-deal Brexit, amid criticism of her industrial legacy. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said MPs sitting behind and alongside the prime minister needed to be told again about the \u201cdisastrous\u201d impact of the UK leaving the EU without an agreement, as he took aim at the government\u2019s record on cars, steel and renewables. But May hit back by insisting Corbyn\u2019s warning would be a little more sincere if he had not consistently voted against her agreement, and thereby increased the risk of a no-deal Brexit. Speaking at PMQs, Corbyn said: \u201cThe country is in crisis over Brexit. Manufacturing is in crisis. The prime minister\u2019s government has brought us to this point. \u201cAnd now the Conservative party is once again in the process of foisting a new prime minister on the country without the country having a say through a general election. \u201cThis prime minister created the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in July 2016. Has the prime minister actually delivered an industrial strategy since then?\u201d May accused Corbyn of writing his question before listening to her previous answer, in which she had laid out details of the government\u2019s industrial strategy across the country and in the Midlands to the Tory MP Michael Fabricant. Corbyn went on to warn UK car production has been \u201cvirtually cut in half\u201d in the past 11 months, saying: \u201cFord has also said that a no-deal Brexit would put a further 6,000 UK jobs at risk, with thousands more at risk in the supply chain. Nissan, Toyota, BMW and JLR have all said similar. \u201cWill the prime minister take this opportunity to reiterate her government\u2019s assessment that a no-deal Brexit would be disastrous for Britain? I think some of her colleagues behind her and alongside her need reminding of that.\u201d May, in her reply, noted: \u201cIt would come a little bit more sincerely from him if he hadn\u2019t gone through the lobbies regularly and consistently voting to increase the chances of no-deal by voting against the deal.\u201d Downing Street has confirmed, to no great surprise, that Tory MPs will be whipped to oppose Labour\u2019s attempt to set aside time later this month to potentially block a no-deal Brexit under May\u2019s successor. A No 10 source said the tactic was \u201ctroubling\u201d, adding: It is an important constitutional principle and we will whip accordingly. In recent months the government has not formally opposed votes on Labour\u2019s opposition day debates, the format under which this one is being held. A spokesman for Jeremy Corbyn said that even if the vote were lost today, the party would seek other parliamentary mechanisms to block a no-deal Brexit, such as a potential no-confidence vote in a prime minister pushing for such a course. He said: If we are not successful, we will find other mechanisms to arrive at the same outcomes. Here are the main points from the Boris Johnson launch. Johnson, the former foreign secretary and clear favourite in the Tory leadership contest, reaffirmed his desire to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October with or without a deal - while refusing to say he would resign if the UK missed this deadline. Asked if he would make this a resigning issue, he said MPs would accept they had to implement Brexit. He explained: I think maturity and a sense of duty will prevail. I think it will be very difficult for friends in parliament to obstruct the will of the people and simply to block Brexit. I think if we now block it, collectively as parliamentarians we will reap the whirlwind and we will face mortal retribution from the electorate. Johnson said that he did not want to leave without a deal, but it said it was essential to prepare for no-deal to increase the chances of getting an agreement. He said he would appoint a new Brext negotiating team that would \u201chit the ground running\u201d and engage with the EU in the \u201cfriendliest possible way\u201d. And he said it would be fatal for both main parties if they failed to deliver Brexit. The real existential threat that I now think faces both parties if we fail to get this thing done. And I think that in the end maturity and a sense of duty will prevail. Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall was not impressed. Johnson brushed aside a complaint about offensive language he has used in the past, saying he thought it was important for politicians to speak directly. He was asked about a column he wrote saying women in burqas looked liked letter boxes, but in his reply he made a general point. He said: I want to make a general point about the way I do things and the language I use. Occasionally some plaster comes off the ceiling as a result of a phrase I may have used, or the way that phrase has been wrenched out of context by those who wish for reasons of their own to caricature. But I think it\u2019s vital for us as politicians to remember that one of the reasons that the public feels alienated now from us all as a breed, is because too often they feel that we are muffling and veiling our language, not speaking as we find - covering everything up in bureaucratic platitudes, when what they want to hear is what we genuinely think. He refused to confirm a previous admission that he took cocaine as a student. Asked if an account he gave to GQ about this was true, he replied: I think the account of this event when I was 19 has appeared many, many times. I think what most people in this country want us to really focus on in this campaign, if I may say so, is what we can do for them and what our plans are for this great country of ours. Asked by another journalist if he had ever broken the law, he said he could not \u201cswear that I have always observed a top speed limit, in this country, of 70mph\u201d. Sky\u2019s Tamara Cohen has the GQ quote. Johnson claimed that his record as London mayor showed that he could provide a \u201csizzling synergy\u201d - promoting growth, thus providing revenue for public services. He explained: We can fight for the teachers, and the nurses and the firemen, and the armed service personnel, and the police, precisely because we are willing to encourage the tech wizards and the shopkeepers and the taxi drivers and, yes, the bankers as well. We enable the extraordinary success of our private sector with a strong, committed, passionate, well-funded public sector. It is that synergy, that symbiosis, that sizzling synergy, that is so fertile in generating further economic growth, that is the formula, that is the way we will bridge the opportunity gap and bring the country together, responding to the mighty plea of the majority of our people for fundamental change. He claimed that he had successfully cut crime in London by promoting stop and search. Talking about his time as mayor, he said: We had kids losing their lives in our city at a rate of 28-30 a year, teenagers were being stabbed to death in London. We had to take some very tough decisions. I believe, frankly, there is nothing kinder or more loving that you can do if you see a young kid coming down the street who may be carrying a knife, than to ask him to turn out, or her, almost invariably him, to turn out his pockets and produce that knife. That is not discriminatory, that is a kind, compassionate, loving thing to do. And it worked. We ended up, as I said just now, we ended up cutting serious youth violence by I think 32%. Knife crime went down, the murder rate went down. My colleague Peter Walker says this claim has been debunked. He said he had done more than anyone else in the Conservative party to defend business. Asked about the time he once declared \u201cfuck business\u201d at a Foreign Office reception, he said this was not his stance. He went on: I don\u2019t think there is anybody in the modern Conservative Party who can honestly be said to have done more to stick up for business, even in the toughest of times. I will stick up for them. This is from the Tory Brexiter Nadine Dorries. My colleague John Crace says this tweet says more about Dorries than it does about Boris Johnson. This is what some political journalists and commentators are saying about the Boris Johnson launch. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar From BuzzFeed\u2019s Stuart Millar From my colleague Peter Walker From the Financial Times\u2019 Sebastian Payne From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Kevin Maguire From the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes From the Observer\u2019s Michael Savage From my colleague Jessica Elgot HuffPost has more on that booing here. Here is my colleague Jessica Elgot\u2019s news story about the Boris Johnson campaign launch. To anyone familiar with Boris Johnson, and in particular the performances he has given at Conservative party conference fringe meetings in recent years, that was a predictable Johnson stump speech \u2013 perhaps a bit shorter on jokes than usual, but generally heavy on sunshine and optimism, short on policy, and focused entirely on how his record as London mayor purportedly shows he is a mainstream politician who can deliver prosperity while raising standards for everyone. A colleague will be looking at the truth of this proposition shortly (and it was striking how Johnson had almost nothing to say about his record as foreign secretary), but this fitted in quite well with what now seems to be the Johnson campaign USP: the claim that he is the unity candidate, acceptable to all wings of the party. Tory MPs and members will not have been particularly surprised by any of this, but it probably did the job, and his passage about how beating Ken Livingstone taught him how to beat Jeremy Corbyn may have struck a chord. Overall, the most impressive thing about the event was probably the large and diverse crowd of Tory MPs who turned up. On policy, he has almost nothing to say at all. In fact, even Rory Stewart\u2019s new age sermon last night probably contained more in in the way of specific commitments. Johnson seems quite happy to make policy through the pages of the Daily Telegraph, but curiously reluctant to discuss it in public. It remains to be seen whether or not this will change as the campaign goes on. Many observers will see this as a weakness, although arguably micro-policy is overrated in a leadership election, which is a test of character. (I remember thinking Yvette Cooper\u2019s campaign was doomed in 2015 when I heard her mulling over whether to accept some minor benefit policy proposal, or whether just to \u201coffer a review\u201d, at an event where what was needed was big picture vision.) Johnson got through the questions without major mishap, although at times his evasiveness was particularly transparent. Faced with a question about his cocaine use (and there are legitimate questions about why this issue is damaging Michael Gove more than Johnson), he just waffled. And he got even more circumlocutory when my colleague Heather Stewart asked if he would resign if he could not deliver Brexit by 31 October. His newfound friends in the ERG will have noted he did not say yes. Johnson was no better than any of the other candidates have been (with the exceptions of Stewart and Mark Harper, who have been a bit more candid) when it came to explaining how he would deliver Brexit. His account of how the vote to leave was partly a protest vote from people who felt ignored by Westminster sounded just like Theresa May circa autumn 2016. At one point, in his waffly answer to Heather, Johnson even started sounding like a pro-European. But the most revealing thing was when he said he was looking forward to the moment when Brexit was no longer a headline issue. (See 11.18am.) Given how badly it has all gone, it is no surprise that one of the key architects of this crisis is keen to talk about something else. The press conference is now over. There were plenty of other journalists wanting to answer questions, but Boris Johnson would not take them. PMQs starts in 10 minutes. I almost always cover PMQs live, but for the next half an hour or so I will focus instead on unpacking the Johnson launch, with a summary, analysis and reaction. I will pick up highlights from PMQs later. Q: [From my colleague Heather Stewart] You have promised to leave the EU on 31 October with or without a deal. Will you commit to resign if you fail to meet that deadline? Johnson says he understands why MPs are trying today to block a no-deal Brexit. But there is a real existential threat to the government if it does not get this done. It will be very difficult for MPs if they fail to deliver Brexit. It was right to have a referendum. The people delivered a clear answer. If MPs block it, they will \u201creap the whirlwind\u201d. He says he is just saying to colleagues, let\u2019s get this done. He says he is not going to pretend it will be \u201cplain sailing\u201d. His team will work flat out. He thinks he will get the result he needs. If there has been one failing, it is that the UK has not made enough of the future partnership with the EU. Not enough has been done to promote \u201ca new Europeanism, and a new Conservative sense of Europeanism\u201d. He says some bilateral relationships have declined. Language teaching has declined. It is time to intensify those partnerships, he says. Johnson refuses to commit to resigning if UK still in EU after October. Q: [From the Financial Times\u2019 George Parker] You famously said \u201cf- business\u201d. What do you say to FT readers worried about this? And why did you say it? Johnson says he loves the FT. He has the app, and reads it every day. He says he thought the anti-banking stance taken by some after the crash was \u201cdisastrous\u201d. And not everyone in financial services is wealthy. As London mayor, he had to sell the UK abroad. If he were prime minister, there would be no more committed salesperson for the UK, he says. Q: Can we sort out this drugs question. You told GQ you had taken cocaine as a student. Were you telling the truth? Johnson says he was 19 at the time. The \u201ccanonical account\u201d of this has appeared many times. He says he is focusing on his vision for the future. He says he does not want to be blown off track. Let\u2019s focus on what Conservatism is, and what it can do. And they also want a leader who can fight off Jeremy Corbyn and the Brexit party. Johnson refuses to confirm whether he took cocaine as a student. Q: Have you done anything illegal? And do you regret any of the mistakes that you have made? Would you change as PM? Johnson says he cannot swear that he has always observed the 70mph speed limit. But is he someone who does what he promises to do as a politician? The answer is yes. We said we would do X. And we did X plus 10. He says knife crime was a big problem when he became mayor. He had to take tough decisions. He says Kit Malthouse and James Cleverly, two MPs now backing him who worked for him as mayor, took tough decisions. He says stop and search was successful. There is nothing kinder you can do than take a knife off a young person, he says. He says there was a 32% reduction in serious youth violence when he was mayor. He says politicians should get behind the police and support them properly. Q: Many of you colleagues worry about your character .. My parrot Q: Your character. Alistair Burt said you brought shame on this country when you described Muslim women as pillar boxes. People who have worked with you do not think you are fit to be PM. Johnson says some of his colleagues do back him. But he wants to address the point. Sometimes \u201cplaster comes off the ceiling\u201d when he says things. But people feel alienated from politicians because they think they are \u201cmuffling and veiling\u201d their language. If he causes offence, he is sorry for that. But he will continue to speak as directly as he can. Johnson says he will take six questions. Q: You said Brexit would be easy, and it wasn\u2019t. You have a reputation for making mistakes. You are telling leavers one thing and remainers another. Can the country trust you? Yes, says Johnson. He rejects the claim that he is inconsistent on Brexit. He does not want no-deal, but he wants to prepare for no-deal. The best way to avoid no-deal is to make the preparations now for it, he say. He says this is the way to get a deal. He says the team he is building will \u201chit the ground running\u201d. They will engage with the EU in the \u201cfriendliest possible way\u201d. And he says he thinks they will respond in a symmetric way. Johnson says he knows the Labour London left. He knows their obsessions. Jeremy Corbyn is far to the left of Ken Livingstone (who Johnson beat twice in London mayoral elections), Johnson says. He says Corbyn is a fundamental threat to our values and our way of life. Johnson claims he has campaigned in almost every seat in the country. He will do anything he can to stop the government of the UK passing into the hands of Labour, who have disdain for wealth creation and who would compromise the government\u2019s ability to fund the NHS. He says he last defeated this sort of leftwinger when the Tories were 17-points behind in London. This is the opening salvo in a battle to protect the country, he says. Johnson says he has seen the UK\u2019s partners want it to recover its self-belief. He says he does not underestimate the challenges lying ahead. But he has real experience managing short-term difficulties on the road to long-term success. He took London through riots and strikes, and he oversaw the Olympics. He shrank the opportunity gap. And he wants to do for the whole country what he did for London. In everything he does he will seek to strengthen the union - this \u201cawesome foursome\u201d that makes the UK a \u201csoftpower superpower\u201d, Johnson says. Johnson says he cut crime. That helped the poorest families, because they suffer disproportionately from crime, he says. And he was able to do this while championing wealth creators. At one point he was the only person in the country speaking up for the financial sector, he says. He says he wants a \u201csizzling synergy\u201d that can promote growth. He says he wants no town, no community, and no person left behind. Johnson says the economy is achieving Grand Prix speeds without firing on all cylinders. He says it is important to unite the country. Parts of the UK feel left behind. We need better infrastructure. Spain has must better hi-speed broadband. Leeds has no metro rail. This is madness, he says. He says the \u201cfundamental moral purpose\u201d of the government should be to bridge not just the wealth gap but the opportunity gap. He says he can do this because he achieved this in London. When he took office as mayor, London had four of the six poorest areas in the country. By the time he left, it had none in the poorest 20. Johnson says the EU do not want no-deal \u201cany more than I do\u201d. Delay means defeat, delay means Corbyn. Kick the can again and we kick the bucket. The Tories\u2019s natural supporters would go to other parties if Brexit were delayed. And all voters would despair at Wesminster being able to deliver anything. Johnson says there would be an overwhelming sense of relief if Brexit were to happen by the end of October. People would start to focus on other things. Johnson says the leave vote was not just about democracy or immigration. People wanted to be heard, he says. They wanted to feel they too could be part of this country. They wanted to know that their concerns were as important to the country\u2019s leaders as those of any \u201cmetropolitan tech guru\u201d. After three years and two missed deadlines, we must leave the EU on October 31. Johnson reaffirms his commitment to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October. He stresses he is not aiming for no-deal. But he says it would be irresponsible to rule it out. Boris Johnson is speaking now. He says the economy has grown since the Brexit vote. The \u201ccommercial dynamism\u201d of the British people has insulated them from the crisis of our politics. But around the country there is a mood of disillusion, or even despair, about our ability to get things done. He says people want clarity and a resolution. That is our mission today. Geoffrey Cox, the Brexiter attorney general, is introducing Boris Johnson at his launch. He says, when choosing the next leader, he has had to consider some \u2018indispensable requirements\u201d. First, these are \u201cextraordinary times, and we need a personality big enough, strong enough to rise to the political challenge\u201d the country faces. Second, we need someone who can provide leadership. A \u201cmanagerial approach\u201d will not suffice. (That amounts to saying Jeremy Hunt would be too dull.) Cox says the new leader must want the UK to be independent of the EU. Third, the new leader must be able to pull together a brilliant team. And, finally, the new leader must be able to unite the Conservative party and outfight Jeremy Corbyn and Nigel Farage in any corner of the country. That is why he is proud to back Boris Johnson, Cox says. This story, by the Financial Times\u2019 George Parker, may come up at the Johnson launch. The story starts: Boris Johnson\u2019s promise to take Britain out of the EU with or without a deal on the scheduled Brexit date of October 31 has been undermined by a confidential cabinet note warning that the country is still far from prepared for the disruption of a disorderly exit. The note, seen by the Financial Times, says the government needs six to eight months of engagement with the pharmaceutical industry \u201cto ensure adequate arrangements are in place to build stockpiles of medicines by October 31\u201d. It also says that it would take \u201cat least 4-5 months\u201d to improve trader readiness for the new border checks that might be required, including the provision of financial incentives to encourage exporters and importers to register for new schemes. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has said that he does not think Boris Johnson would be able to deliver on his promise to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October, MLex\u2019s Matthew Holehouse reports. Hammond also said that taking the UK out of the EU by 31 October would be \u201cimpossible\u201d and that trying to implement this policy would not be in the national interest. From the Tory MP Zac Goldsmith The leading French newspaper Le Monde has an editorial saying it does not want to see Boris Johnson as prime minister, Le Monde\u2019s Philippe Bernard reports. From my colleague John Crace From the Mail\u2019s Jason Groves From Steve Baker, the Brexiter Tory backing Boris Johnson From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Harry Cole From the Telegraph\u2019s Gordon Rayner Philip Hammond, the chancellor, is speaking at a Bloomberg event. There is a live feed here. Hammond has just started, and at the moment he is talking about the tech sector, Journalists arriving for the Boris Johnson launch are being offered \u201cBoris bacon butties\u201d and \u201cBoris eggs Benedict\u201d inside the venue, the Press Association reports. They are also being invited to wear \u201cBack Boris\u201d badges. Sarah Vine, Michael Gove\u2019s wife, has used her column in the Daily Mail today to write about her husband having to admit to having taken cocaine before he became an MP. The article does not contain any new information, but, in a reference to the unnamed source thought to have leaked the cocaine story to a journalist, she writes about what it feels like to have trust betrayed. As traumatic as the past few days have been for us and our family, I actually think it has been all to the good ... It has taught me some useful lessons about trust, friendship and the nature of both, which \u2014 whatever the outcome of the current race \u2014 are universally valid. Specifically, friendships are judged by actions, not words. Trust may be freely given, but you should not always expect it in return, and certainly not when the intoxicating scent of power is in the air. It would be fascinating to see David Cameron\u2019s reaction when he reads this. Given what happened during the 2016 referendum campaign, Cameron does not feel Michael Gove is well placed to lecture anyone on trust. The Daily Telegraph has today written up some polling it has commissioned from ComRes that appears to be hugely favourable to Boris Johnson, the paper\u2019s star columnist and its favoured candidate for the Tory leadership. ComRes asked how people would vote with alternative candidates as leader and the results suggest they would do best under Johnson. ComRes has also tried to estimate what a general election result might look like on the basis of these figures. It claims that polling suggests Johnson could produce a Commons majority of 140 for the Tories, while under all his rivals there would be a hung parliament. The Telegraph has not put these figures on the front, but they are featured very prominently on a huge double-page spread on the inside. But do these figures have any merit? In a lengthy Twitter thread, the politics professor Rob Ford explains why there are so many questionable assumptions in this research as to make these results highly suspect. His thread starts here. And here is one of his key points. Ford\u2019s analysis is very sound, although there is probably a kernel of truth in the ComRes research - that Johnson is the currently the Tory candidate with most appeal to former Tories who are currently supporting the Brexit party. But this ignores another point - which is that the Conservatives probably cannot win a general election with this group alone. As my colleague Heather Stewart said in a recent story, this is an argument made recently by Robert Hayward, a Tory peer and respected psephologist. Here is an extract from her story. [Hayward] said it would be impossible for the Tories to win an election with a leader who was not \u201ctransfer friendly\u201d, and able to attract swing voters who were neither committed leavers nor remainers. \u201cA Tory prime minister or leader can\u2019t win without Brexiteers; but you actually can\u2019t win without the people who don\u2019t strongly identify with one side or the other, and are looking for good government,\u201d he said. And he said Johnson may not be the right person to do that because many voters have a \u201cdistinct antipathy\u201d towards him. He said that while Johnson was very popular with a section of the electorate, he was also the leadership frontrunner who voters were most likely to say would make a bad prime minister. Hayward pointed to a recent YouGov poll that suggested as many as 23% of respondents who had voted Conservative in 2017 thought Johnson would be a \u201cvery bad\u201d prime minister. Boris Johnson, the favourite in the Tory leadership contest, will break cover today and face the media for the first time in weeks, following complaints that such aversion to scrutiny is a travesty for someone likely to be the next prime minister. His team reject this claim, and say it is just that he has been focusing his efforts on talking to individual MPs, who at this stage are the electorate in the contest. He will be speaking this morning at his campaign launch. As a warm-up, Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury and one of his most prominent backers, has been giving interviews on his behalf this morning. On the Today programme she did not have an easy time. Truss said that Johnson had \u201cnothing to hide\u201d when challenged about his character, including past lies and gaffes. She claimed the fact that he was being attacked so ferociously by his opponents was a response to his \u201chuge public appeal\u201d. When the accusation that Johnson was \u201cthe worst foreign secretary in living memory\u201d was put to her by the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, she replied: I think it\u2019s a sign - that he is being attacked shows the huge public appeal he has, the huge power he has to communicate. His record is of being the most successful mayor of London we have had, of being an excellent foreign secretary who got countries around the world to take action against Russia by expelling their diplomats. She said that anyone who blamed him for contributing to the ongoing imprisonment of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in Iran was an apologist for the Iranian regime. In 2017 Johnson wrongly said that Zaghari-Ratcliffe was in the country teaching journalism when she was jailed. He subsequently retracted this, but his comment was cited by the Iranian authorities to help justify her ongoing detention. But Truss said it was wrong to blame Johnson for Zaghari-Ratcliffe being in jail. She said: I think this is a complete misplacement of blame. The people who are keeping Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in jail are the Iranians. This is an oppressive Iranian regime - I think it\u2019s apologists for that regime who are putting the blame on Boris Johnson... The fact is he did a brilliant job in my opinion as foreign secretary... and in the case that you\u2019ve just mentioned, it\u2019s the Iranian regime who have held this innocent women in jail - let\u2019s put the blame where it is really deserved. Here is the agenda for the day. 10.40am: Philip Hammond, the chanellor, speaks at a Bloomberg conference. 11am: Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, launches his campaign for the Tory leadership. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. Around 1pm: MPs started debating the cross-party motion intended to allow the Commons to vote on legislation to block a no-deal Brexit. The vote is expected mid afternoon. 3.30pm: Sajid Javid, the home secretary, launches his campaign for the Tory leadership. 4pm: The Conservative backbench 1922 Committee holds a private hustings. The candidates speaking are, in order: Johnson, Esther McVey, Rory Stewart and Matt Hancock. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on the Tory leadership contest and the Commons debate. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up at the end of the day. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "The Conservative leadership hopeful Esther McVey has spent thousands of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money claiming for a personal photographer on expenses. The MP has submitted claims worth \u00a38,750 for the services of the photographer and PR man Jonathan Farber in just two years, according to an analysis of data held by the expenses watchdog. McVey \u2013 whose website is adorned with photographs of herself \u2013 hired Farber, an ex-Tory councillor in her constituency in Cheshire. One receipt obtained using freedom of information laws from May 2018 shows that Farber invoiced McVey \u00a3750 for five hours\u2019 work for two shoots including \u201cedits, image processing and travel time\u201d. One of the shoots featured McVey, who was a broadcaster and businesswoman before entering politics, showing her support for paddle boarders joining the fight against plastic waste. The other was for a Women\u2019s Institute shoot and talk. The invoice is from \u201cJonathan Farber photo, video &amp; consultancy\u201d, and states McVey is being billed for \u201ccomms consultancy\u201d, adding: \u201cFixed rate retained professional photo, video and communications services.\u201d McVey, who takes home an annual salary of \u00a379,468 as an MP, says she is standing in the Tory leadership race as a \u201cpublic servant\u201d, but is an underdog, with only a handful of MPs publicly backing her campaign. McVey\u2019s expense claims could prove controversial with her colleagues. In 2018-19, she claimed \u00a36,000 for Farber\u2019s services, and \u00a32,750 in 2017-18. In total, McVey has submitted claims for Farber\u2019s services on 13 occasions, the majority of which describe his work as \u201ccomms\u201d or \u201cconsultancy\u201d. All of the claims were approved by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), which said: \u201cCommunication is a large part of an MP\u2019s role and they are able to claim professional services to support them carrying out their duties. This could include photography to be used on their website and other digital and print communication channels.\u201d Although some other MPs have claimed for professional photography, most have done so for significantly smaller amounts than the sums McVey has disbursed. On his LinkedIn page, Farber says he does \u201cvisual communications\u201d for McVey. He was a town councillor in Knutsford from 2015 to May 2019. His website states that he charges \u00a3125 an hour for private photography and \u00a3175 for \u201ccommercial press/PR photography\u201d. In March last year, Farber\u2019s PR firm, WA16, posted a picture of the MP on social media, adding: \u201cA gritty press shoot here with Rt Hon Esther McVey MP with @highwaysengland just hours before the snow began to fall.\u201d In February 2018, the account posted another picture of McVey standing with a group outside Alderley BioHub, which houses laboratories, in her Tatton constituency. McVey\u2019s leadership bid centres around her belief in what she describes as \u201cblue collar conservatism\u201d, which champions \u201cworking people\u201d.

It came after controversy over protesters, including parents, demonstrating outside the gates of a Birmingham primary school against LGBT teaching. The 51-year-old served as the MP for Wirral West from 2010 to 2015 before losing her seat. She was re-elected in the former chancellor George Osborne\u2019s old constituency, Tatton, in 2017.

      "body": "<p>As a disabled person and campaigner for disability rights in the 1980s, 1990s and until 2005, I would say Frances Ryan\u2019s account of how we are treated is this country is depressingly and frighteningly accurate (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/09/disabled-person-safety-net\" title=\"\">What kind of a country we become: ask a disabled person</a>, 10 June). We fought so hard for and eventually achieved civil rights and a Disability Rights Commission (DRC) under the last Labour government in the late 1990s. That highly effective commission, led and administered by disabled people, was abolished by the Labour government and disability issues were merged into the newly formed Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).</p> <p>If the DRC had remained intact, it may well have been much harder for the Conservative government from 2010 to slice away at our equal rights, benefits, services and status in society. Unforgivably, our local networks and our highly effective national disability movement \u2013 with its commitment to diversity and inclusion \u2013 have also been sliced away.</p> <p>Getting out and about to campaign and lobby is a non-starter if assistance with basic personal care is denied. No wonder we\u2019ve been rendered invisible. So what are we to do? I throw down the gauntlet to old campaigners, new campaigners and allies to launch a fightback and reclaim our rights and equal status in society. What do you say?<br><strong>Jane Nation</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Equality and diversity training seems to have gone out of the window again. I find it is now my companion who is addressed on my behalf in restaurants, on public transport etc. This used to be the case, but things had got better. Maybe the training is too expensive? A small thing by comparison to the meat of the article, but it did make a difference.<br><strong>Jane Tomlin</strong><br><em>Wylam, Northumberland</em></p> <p>\u2022 We were struck by the news that <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/news/apprenticeship-target-achieved-for-eighth-year-in-a-row/\" title=\"\">more than 28,000 people in Scotland</a> started modern apprenticeships (MA) last year, rising for the eighth consecutive year. Greatly to be welcomed is the increase in the number of those who are disabled starting an MA, up 28% on 2017-18.

      "bodyText": "As a disabled person and campaigner for disability rights in the 1980s, 1990s and until 2005, I would say Frances Ryan\u2019s account of how we are treated is this country is depressingly and frighteningly accurate (What kind of a country we become: ask a disabled person, 10 June). We fought so hard for and eventually achieved civil rights and a Disability Rights Commission (DRC) under the last Labour government in the late 1990s. That highly effective commission, led and administered by disabled people, was abolished by the Labour government and disability issues were merged into the newly formed Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). If the DRC had remained intact, it may well have been much harder for the Conservative government from 2010 to slice away at our equal rights, benefits, services and status in society. Unforgivably, our local networks and our highly effective national disability movement \u2013 with its commitment to diversity and inclusion \u2013 have also been sliced away. Getting out and about to campaign and lobby is a non-starter if assistance with basic personal care is denied. No wonder we\u2019ve been rendered invisible. So what are we to do? I throw down the gauntlet to old campaigners, new campaigners and allies to launch a fightback and reclaim our rights and equal status in society. What do you say? Jane Nation London \u2022 Equality and diversity training seems to have gone out of the window again. I find it is now my companion who is addressed on my behalf in restaurants, on public transport etc. This used to be the case, but things had got better. Maybe the training is too expensive? A small thing by comparison to the meat of the article, but it did make a difference. Jane Tomlin Wylam, Northumberland \u2022 We were struck by the news that more than 28,000 people in Scotland started modern apprenticeships (MA) last year, rising for the eighth consecutive year. Greatly to be welcomed is the increase in the number of those who are disabled starting an MA, up 28% on 2017-18. The proportion of those starting an MA and who have a disability is now 14%, representative of the percentage of the population who identify as disabled. The rewards of getting these young people, many of whom boast excellent skills, into work are well worth it, often demonstrating higher loyalty and retention rates. They bring passion, skills, dedication and drive to the workplace. Recruiting a modern apprentice enables employers to fill the skills gaps that exist within their current workforce, as apprentices begin to learn sector-specific skills from day one, developing specialist knowledge that will positively affect the bottom line. We would urge Scotland\u2019s employers to continue to look beyond the label and take on an apprentice who has a disability, taking advantage of the excellent skills offered by many of these young people.

      "body": "<p>This is a strange time to be debating whether capitalism is broken, at least in the United States.</p> <p>The economy has added jobs every month since October 2010 for a total of over 20m net new payroll jobs. The unemployment rate is below 4%, lower than it has been since 1969. Wage growth is finally accelerating, clocking in at a rate well above 3% a year for typical workers.</p> <p>The workforce participation rate for people ages 25 to 54 has increased by 1.6 percentage points since 2015, wiping out half a decade of decline. There are more job openings than unemployed workers in the US. The number of workers experiencing long-term unemployment is lower today than it was when the Great Recession began.</p> <p>So much for a stagnant economy. What about inequality? A recent report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office belies the general claims that economic divisions are rapidly widening.

The economy has added jobs every month since October 2010 for a total of over 20m net new payroll jobs. The unemployment rate is below 4%, lower than it has been since 1969. Wage growth is finally accelerating, clocking in at a rate well above 3% a year for typical workers. The workforce participation rate for people ages 25 to 54 has increased by 1.6 percentage points since 2015, wiping out half a decade of decline. There are more job openings than unemployed workers in the US. The number of workers experiencing long-term unemployment is lower today than it was when the Great Recession began. So much for a stagnant economy. What about inequality? A recent report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office belies the general claims that economic divisions are rapidly widening. The CBO examined inequality on several measures: income generated in markets (employment, business and capital income); the sum of market income and payments from social insurance programs; and income with and without safety net benefits and services and before and after federal tax payments. Across these different measures, inequality rose between 1979 and 2006 by between 24 and 28%, depending on the precise definition of income. (The report uses the standard \u201cGini coefficient\u201d inequality measure.) But since 2007 inequality has leveled out or even declined.

      "body": "<p>Who in their right mind would want the job? It is almost certain to end, as Theresa May found, in failure and public execration. To seek to be prime minister today suggests either reckless confidence or an insatiable hunger for power. Perhaps we need a reverse catch-22 in British politics: anyone crazy enough to apply for this post should be disqualified from running.</p> <p>A few years ago, the psychologist Michelle Roya Rad <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/characteristics-of-trustw_b_927982\" title=\"\">listed the characteristics</a> of good leadership. Among them were fairness and objectivity; a desire to serve society rather than just yourself; a lack of interest in fame and attention; and resistance to the temptation to hide the truth or make impossible promises. Conversely, <a href=\"https://digitalscholarship.tsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.co.uk/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1048&amp;context=jpmsp\" title=\"\">a paper</a> in the Journal of Public Management and Social Policy has listed the characteristics of leaders with psychopathic, narcissistic or Machiavellian personalities. These include: a tendency to manipulate others; a preparedness to lie and deceive to achieve your ends; a lack of remorse and sensitivity; and a desire for admiration, attention, prestige and status. Which of these lists, do you think, best describes the people vying to lead the Conservative party?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/10/behold-the-tory-leadership-candidates-all-in-denial-all-in-dreamland\">Behold, the Tory leadership candidates: all in denial, all in dreamland | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In politics, almost everywhere we see what looks like the externalisation of psychic wounds or deficits. Sigmund Freud <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/resolution-not-conflict/201110/freud-had-it-right-about-leaders\" title=\"\">claimed that</a> \u201cgroups take on the personality of the leader\u201d. I think it would be more accurate to say that the private tragedies of powerful people become the public tragedies of those they dominate. For some people, it is easier to command a nation, to send thousands to their deaths in unnecessary wars, to separate children from their families and inflict terrible suffering, than to process their own trauma and pain. What we appear to see in national politics around the world is a playing out in public of deep private distress.</p> <p>This could be a particularly potent force in British politics. The psychotherapist Nick Duffell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jun/09/boarding-schools-bad-leaders-politicians-bullies-bumblers\" title=\"\">has written</a> of \u201cwounded leaders\u201d, who were separated from their families in early childhood when they were sent to boarding school. They develop a \u201csurvival personality\u201d, learning to cut off their feelings and project a false self, characterised by a public display of competence and self-reliance. Beneath this persona is a profound insecurity, which might generate an insatiable need for power, prestige and attention. The result is a system that \u201cconsistently turns out people who appear much more competent than they actually are\u201d.</p> <p>The problem is not confined to these shores. Donald Trump occupies the most powerful seat on Earth, yet still he appears to seethe with envy and resentment. \u201cIf President Obama made the deals that I have made,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1137712485769863168\" title=\"\">he claimed</a> this week, \u201cthe corrupt media would be hailing them as incredible \u2026 With me, despite our record-setting economy and all that I have done, no credit!\u201d No amount of wealth or power seems able to satisfy his need for affirmation and assurance.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Those who should be least trusted with power are most likely to win it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I believe that anyone who wants to stand in a national election should receive a course of psychotherapy. Completing the course should be a qualification for office. This wouldn\u2019t change the behaviour of psychopaths, but it might prevent some people who exercise power from imposing their own deep wounds on others. I\u2019ve had two courses: one influenced by Freud and Donald Winnicott, the other by Paul Gilbert\u2019s <a href=\"https://compassionatemind.co.uk/\" title=\"\">compassion-focused</a> approach. I found them both immensely helpful. I believe almost everyone would benefit from such treatment.</p> <p>The underlying problem is the system through which such people jostle. Toxic personalities thrive in toxic environments. Those who should be least trusted with power are most likely to win it. A <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0029392\" title=\"\">study</a> in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology suggests that the group of psychopathic traits known as \u201cfearless dominance\u201d is associated with behaviours that are widely valued in leaders, such as making bold decisions and bestriding the world stage. If so, we surely value the wrong characteristics. If success within the system requires psychopathic traits, there is something wrong with the system.</p> <p>In designing an effective politics, it could be useful to work backwards: to decide what kind of people we would like to see representing us, then create a system that would bring them to the fore. I want to be represented by people who are thoughtful, self-aware and collaborative. What would a system that elevated such people look like?</p> <p>It would not be a purely representative democracy. This works on the principle of presumed consent: \u201cYou elected me three years ago, therefore you are presumed to have consented to the policy I\u2019m about to implement, whether or not I mentioned it at the time.\u201d It rewards the \u201cstrong, decisive\u201d leaders who so often lead their nations to catastrophe. A system that tempers representative democracy with participative democracy \u2013 citizens\u2019 assemblies, <a href=\"https://www.citizenlab.co/blog/civic-engagement/steps-to-effective-participatory-budgeting/\" title=\"\">participatory budgeting</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/18/referendums-bad-press-fix-britain-more-of-them-participatory-democracy\" title=\"\">co-creation of public policy</a> \u2013 is more likely to reward responsive and considerate politicians. Proportional representation, which prevents governments with minority support from dominating the nation, is another potential safeguard \u2013 though no guarantee.</p> <p>In rethinking politics, let us develop systems that encourage kindness, empathy and emotional intelligence. Let us ditch systems that encourage people to hide their pain by dominating others.</p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist</p>",

To seek to be prime minister today suggests either reckless confidence or an insatiable hunger for power. Perhaps we need a reverse catch-22 in British politics: anyone crazy enough to apply for this post should be disqualified from running. A few years ago, the psychologist Michelle Roya Rad listed the characteristics of good leadership. Among them were fairness and objectivity; a desire to serve society rather than just yourself; a lack of interest in fame and attention; and resistance to the temptation to hide the truth or make impossible promises. Conversely, a paper in the Journal of Public Management and Social Policy has listed the characteristics of leaders with psychopathic, narcissistic or Machiavellian personalities. These include: a tendency to manipulate others; a preparedness to lie and deceive to achieve your ends; a lack of remorse and sensitivity; and a desire for admiration, attention, prestige and status. Which of these lists, do you think, best describes the people vying to lead the Conservative party? In politics, almost everywhere we see what looks like the externalisation of psychic wounds or deficits. Sigmund Freud claimed that \u201cgroups take on the personality of the leader\u201d. I think it would be more accurate to say that the private tragedies of powerful people become the public tragedies of those they dominate. For some people, it is easier to command a nation, to send thousands to their deaths in unnecessary wars, to separate children from their families and inflict terrible suffering, than to process their own trauma and pain. What we appear to see in national politics around the world is a playing out in public of deep private distress. This could be a particularly potent force in British politics. The psychotherapist Nick Duffell has written of \u201cwounded leaders\u201d, who were separated from their families in early childhood when they were sent to boarding school. They develop a \u201csurvival personality\u201d, learning to cut off their feelings and project a false self, characterised by a public display of competence and self-reliance. Beneath this persona is a profound insecurity, which might generate an insatiable need for power, prestige and attention. The result is a system that \u201cconsistently turns out people who appear much more competent than they actually are\u201d. The problem is not confined to these shores. Donald Trump occupies the most powerful seat on Earth, yet still he appears to seethe with envy and resentment. \u201cIf President Obama made the deals that I have made,\u201d he claimed this week, \u201cthe corrupt media would be hailing them as incredible \u2026 With me, despite our record-setting economy and all that I have done, no credit!\u201d No amount of wealth or power seems able to satisfy his need for affirmation and assurance. I believe that anyone who wants to stand in a national election should receive a course of psychotherapy. Completing the course should be a qualification for office. This wouldn\u2019t change the behaviour of psychopaths, but it might prevent some people who exercise power from imposing their own deep wounds on others. I\u2019ve had two courses: one influenced by Freud and Donald Winnicott, the other by Paul Gilbert\u2019s compassion-focused approach. I found them both immensely helpful. I believe almost everyone would benefit from such treatment. The underlying problem is the system through which such people jostle. Toxic personalities thrive in toxic environments. Those who should be least trusted with power are most likely to win it. A study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology suggests that the group of psychopathic traits known as \u201cfearless dominance\u201d is associated with behaviours that are widely valued in leaders, such as making bold decisions and bestriding the world stage. If so, we surely value the wrong characteristics. If success within the system requires psychopathic traits, there is something wrong with the system. In designing an effective politics, it could be useful to work backwards: to decide what kind of people we would like to see representing us, then create a system that would bring them to the fore. I want to be represented by people who are thoughtful, self-aware and collaborative. What would a system that elevated such people look like? It would not be a purely representative democracy. This works on the principle of presumed consent: \u201cYou elected me three years ago, therefore you are presumed to have consented to the policy I\u2019m about to implement, whether or not I mentioned it at the time.\u201d It rewards the \u201cstrong, decisive\u201d leaders who so often lead their nations to catastrophe. A system that tempers representative democracy with participative democracy \u2013 citizens\u2019 assemblies, participatory budgeting, the co-creation of public policy \u2013 is more likely to reward responsive and considerate politicians. Proportional representation, which prevents governments with minority support from dominating the nation, is another potential safeguard \u2013 though no guarantee. In rethinking politics, let us develop systems that encourage kindness, empathy and emotional intelligence. Let us ditch systems that encourage people to hide their pain by dominating others. \u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist",
