But even granting that some people may be taking antidepressants who previously went untreated, there is a debate about whether pills are being overprescribed. Mental illness remains a complicated and contested area. A study last year that looked at the results of more than 500 trials concluded that antidepressants \u2013 most of which are SSRIs, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors \u2013 are effective treatments. But psychological therapies are also effective, and recommended in the UK for depression along with drugs. While a prescription remains the most common outcome of a GP visit, waiting lists for talking therapy are long and there is evidence that older people are referred less often than other age groups, despite a government programme supposed to boost access to this kind of support. Meanwhile MPs have raised concerns about the difficulties patients have coming off antidepressants, while evidence about long-term use is scarce. Antidepressants are a vital tool and are among the most commonly prescribed drugs in the western world. But they must not be the only therapy offered to depressed people, who can benefit from other forms of help \u2013 including the chance to think about what has made them unwell, if there are personal or environmental factors. The promised boost in so-called \u201csocial prescribing\u201d by GPs, of exercise and activities, could be a positive step. As the NHS recognises, brain chemistry is not the be all and end all.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s not often you have a public row about the meaning of \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d, but in the heated cauldron of contemporary politics, almost anything can become a controversy.</p> <p>Last week, Tory MP and leading Brexiter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/mar/26/tory-mp-criticised-for-using-antisemitic-term-cultural-marxism\" title=\"\">Suella Braverman</a> spoke of \u201cthis ongoing creep of cultural Marxism which has come from Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. Critics seized on the phrase as being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/19/cultural-marxism-a-uniting-theory-for-rightwingers-who-love-to-play-the-victim\" title=\"\">antisemitic</a>. The Board of Deputies of British Jews observed that the phrase originated with the Nazis, who used the term <em>Kulturbolschewismus</em> (cultural Bolshevism) to accuse Jewish intellectuals of moral degeneracy. The deputies urged Braverman not to use the phrase in future. She insisted she was simply referring to Corbyn\u2019s \u201cauthoritarian tendencies\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The row illuminates the inflamed character of public debate, the willingness to attribute bad faith to opponents</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the postwar years, \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d became a phrase in academic debates about the changing character of Marxist theory. In the 1990s, many on the US right, such as Pat Buchanan, used it to criticise the \u201cdegeneracy\u201d of the west. And it\u2019s become a choice phrase on the contemporary far right, constantly used, for instance, by Norwegian mass-murderer Anders Breivik.</p> <p>Few would suggest that postwar academics were being antisemitic. Most would accept that Breivik is. And Braverman? She was probably using the term more in the Buchanan than in the Breivik sense. It\u2019s a stupid phrase, and unwise, but not necessarily playing to antisemitic themes.</p> <p>What the row does illuminate is the inflamed character of public debate, the willingness to attribute bad faith to opponents, to look for \u201cGotcha!\u201d moments. We should be careful not to reheat antisemitic terms. We should be careful, too, not to overheat public debates.</p> <p>\u2022Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s not often you have a public row about the meaning of \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d, but in the heated cauldron of contemporary politics, almost anything can become a controversy. Last week, Tory MP and leading Brexiter Suella Braverman spoke of \u201cthis ongoing creep of cultural Marxism which has come from Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. Critics seized on the phrase as being antisemitic. The Board of Deputies of British Jews observed that the phrase originated with the Nazis, who used the term Kulturbolschewismus (cultural Bolshevism) to accuse Jewish intellectuals of moral degeneracy. The deputies urged Braverman not to use the phrase in future. She insisted she was simply referring to Corbyn\u2019s \u201cauthoritarian tendencies\u201d. In the postwar years, \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d became a phrase in academic debates about the changing character of Marxist theory. In the 1990s, many on the US right, such as Pat Buchanan, used it to criticise the \u201cdegeneracy\u201d of the west. And it\u2019s become a choice phrase on the contemporary far right, constantly used, for instance, by Norwegian mass-murderer Anders Breivik. Few would suggest that postwar academics were being antisemitic. Most would accept that Breivik is. And Braverman? She was probably using the term more in the Buchanan than in the Breivik sense. It\u2019s a stupid phrase, and unwise, but not necessarily playing to antisemitic themes. What the row does illuminate is the inflamed character of public debate, the willingness to attribute bad faith to opponents, to look for \u201cGotcha!\u201d moments. We should be careful not to reheat antisemitic terms. We should be careful, too, not to overheat public debates. \u2022Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",
