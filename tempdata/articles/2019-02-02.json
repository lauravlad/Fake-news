Unrest within Labour \u2013 and talk of the party fracturing \u2013 will be fuelled by the latest Opinium poll for the Observer today, which shows a dramatic fall in its support at a time of chaos and turmoil in the Tory party. Labour is now seven points behind the Conservatives, with approval ratings for Corbyn over his handling of Brexit at an all-time low and worse than those for May.

Next Saturday\u2019s visit to Murrayfield to face Scotland now has a very different feel to it. Ireland will surely be better than this but the shamrock aura has been unceremoniously pierced. In some ways Schmidt might be privately relieved. Now his side can revert to their default setting: not getting above their station, battling the perceived odds. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing about the English psyche which I\u2019ve always found interesting,\u201d wrote the perceptive ex-Ireland international Donncha O\u2019Callaghan on the morning of the game. \u201cOnce you tell them how good they are they grow. They thrive on the mindset that they are better than what they are up against.\u201d That kind of thing comes less naturally to many Irish sportsmen, as this muted performance seemed to underline.",

      "bodyText": "The deputy mayor of Mildura, Jason Modica, will become the second independent candidate to challenge the National party in the seat of Mallee \u2013 running on the issues of water, climate change and people power. Known as \u201cJake the Tradie\u201d, Modica served on Mildura council with Ali Cupper, who unexpectedly won the state seat of Mildura last year as an independent, a seat held by the Nationals on a 8% margin. Modica enters the field after the sitting Nationals MP, Andrew Broad, a vocal supporter of traditional marriage, announced his retirement following New Idea allegations he met up with a younger woman in Hong Kong via a sugar daddy dating website. Modica is an Australian Conservation Fund river fellow, a program aimed at providing advocacy on behalf of the Murray Darling communities. Last year he was one of several councillors who wrote to Broad asking him to \u201cspeak up about Queensland and NSW\u2019s refusal to acknowledge natural and historic flows\u201d through the Darling and clarify his stance on alleged theft and over-allocation in the Barwon Darling system. Broad wrote back, telling councillors to stick to issues at their own level of government and noted that the Barwon-Darling was not within the Mallee electorate.

Modica enters the fray alongside the former Yarriambiack mayor and Wimmera farmer Ray Kingston, who is running on climate change, federal funding for local councils and roads as well as attracting more people to the Mallee through immigration. While there has been speculation that Tony Abbott\u2019s former chief of staff Peta Credlin may run as a Liberal candidate, the Victorian Liberal party did not return Guardian Australia\u2019s calls or emails.

But one of the biggest debates in the 2019 election, following the entrance of high-profile centre-right independents, is climate change. Rural independent candidates in Mallee as well as Indi\u2019s Helen Haines are mirroring the climate concerns of city-based independent candidates including former Liberal MP Julia Banks in Flinders, the former Liberal member and banker Oliver Yates in Kooyong, Wentworth MP Kerryn Phelps and Warringah candidate Zali Steggall. Their stance is in marked contrast in rural areas to the Coalition, which has pushed taxpayer funding for new coal fired plants. The Nationals leader and deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, rejected the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report\u2019s call to phase out coal power by 2050. Webster told Guardian Australia that climate issues needed to be addressed and resolved, saying she did not want to \u201cwarm the seat\u201d and wanted her grandchildren to look up to her. \u201cRegardless of what anyone in politics says, the reality is climate issues have to be resolved, international covenants have to be followed through and I would like to see that we are more open to all kinds of energy,\u201d Webster said. \u201cThere has been a polarisation around coal, which has a finite end date, and the fact is everyone wants affordable and reliable energy.

      "body": "<p>Time is running out for Fulham. With the weeks flying by and defeats piling up, their hopes of conjuring a miraculous escape are fading and for all that Claudio Ranieri tried to keep the mood light after witnessing another lamentable effort on the road from his naive side, the Italian must have seen signs of a group who have already started to accept their fate.</p> <p>More than anything, it was the lack of fight that was most troubling once a dismal error from Cyrus Christie had sent Crystal Palace on their way to a crucial win in the battle to stay in the Premier League. Buoyed by a lively cameo from Michy Batshuayi, Palace fully merited a victory that eased relegation pressure and left Ranieri\u2019s side looking forlorn in 19th place, seven points behind fourth-bottom Burnley and with the walls closing in as 13 games remain.</p> <p>Any positivity Fulham generated after that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/29/fulham-brighton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">thrilling comeback against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion</a> on Tuesday is gone. They lacked the nous to deal with the tension and a first away win of the season was never going to happen, even though Ranieri rued the moment when Aleksandar Mitrovic wasted a glorious opportunity to give Fulham an early lead. \u201cIf we score a goal, I think it could change the match,\u201d Fulham\u2019s manager said. \u201cWhen you take a chance, maybe everybody is more combined and strong.\u201d</p> <p>It was a surprise to see a striker of Mitrovic\u2019s aerial prowess fluff his lines when Joe Bryan\u2019s cross found him unmarked in the six-yard box. Normally so deadly in the air, Fulham\u2019s top scorer wore the look of a man who knew he could not rely on his teammates in defence to lessen the effect of his profligacy. The striker has seen enough to know that mistakes are never far away and it was not long before the division\u2019s worst backline presented their hosts with a gift.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dac2d70a4641a0ce51008e5580adf1d17a6fba8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dac2d70a4641a0ce51008e5580adf1d17a6fba8/0_61_4954_2973/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luka Milivojevic celebrates scoring a penalty.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luka Milivojevic celebrates scoring a penalty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sebastian Frej/MB Media/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was no hint of danger when James McArthur hit a diagonal pass into Fulham\u2019s area in the 25th minute.

      "bodyText": "Time is running out for Fulham. With the weeks flying by and defeats piling up, their hopes of conjuring a miraculous escape are fading and for all that Claudio Ranieri tried to keep the mood light after witnessing another lamentable effort on the road from his naive side, the Italian must have seen signs of a group who have already started to accept their fate. More than anything, it was the lack of fight that was most troubling once a dismal error from Cyrus Christie had sent Crystal Palace on their way to a crucial win in the battle to stay in the Premier League. Buoyed by a lively cameo from Michy Batshuayi, Palace fully merited a victory that eased relegation pressure and left Ranieri\u2019s side looking forlorn in 19th place, seven points behind fourth-bottom Burnley and with the walls closing in as 13 games remain. Any positivity Fulham generated after that thrilling comeback against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on Tuesday is gone. They lacked the nous to deal with the tension and a first away win of the season was never going to happen, even though Ranieri rued the moment when Aleksandar Mitrovic wasted a glorious opportunity to give Fulham an early lead. \u201cIf we score a goal, I think it could change the match,\u201d Fulham\u2019s manager said. \u201cWhen you take a chance, maybe everybody is more combined and strong.\u201d It was a surprise to see a striker of Mitrovic\u2019s aerial prowess fluff his lines when Joe Bryan\u2019s cross found him unmarked in the six-yard box. Normally so deadly in the air, Fulham\u2019s top scorer wore the look of a man who knew he could not rely on his teammates in defence to lessen the effect of his profligacy. The striker has seen enough to know that mistakes are never far away and it was not long before the division\u2019s worst backline presented their hosts with a gift. There was no hint of danger when James McArthur hit a diagonal pass into Fulham\u2019s area in the 25th minute. Yet the presence of Christian Benteke unsettled Christie, who threw out an arm in a doomed attempt to clear. Michael Oliver, the referee, was almost apologetic as he penalised the wing-back, giving Luka Milivojevic the chance to beat Sergio Rico from the spot. Ranieri condemned \u201ca stupid foul\u201d and even Roy Hodgson, Palace\u2019s manager, struggled to make sense of Christie\u2019s thinking. \u201cWe got a piece of good fortune,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Christie to handle it and give us that penalty. Only he would be able to tell us how it came about.\u201d It was one-way traffic after Milivojevic had struck a powerful penalty past Rico, who was by far the busier of the two goalkeepers. Belief soared through Palace after a nervy start and Benteke, who looked determined to make up for lost time after being handed his first start since 1 September, was unfortunate to see an overhead kick crash against the bar. Perhaps the arrival of another Belgian forward on deadline day has stirred Benteke after a difficult campaign. Palace have more competition in attack after signing Batshuayi and Hodgson was grateful to have the Chelsea loanee in reserve once Benteke had tired, especially as Wilfried Zaha was suspended. On came Batshuayi, turning on the edge of the area and firing a shot that Rico palmed to Jeffrey Schlupp to gobble up from the rebound. \u201cIt was an incredible impact,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cHe has scored in almost every debut he\u2019s had and he almost kept that record going.\u201d Ranieri, whose side failed to muster a single shot on target, tried to finish on a defiant note. \u201cWe have to continue to fight,\u201d he said. \u201cWe lost a battle but not the war.

      "bodyText": "Here is the report: England are yet to emerge from the dressing-room. How do you teach application? Answers on the back of an envelope to NW8. The difficulty for England is that the entire batting line-up has the same strengths, the same weaknesses. Bob Willis agrees: \u201cThe batting is a real-real problem. You cannot just go out and play shots. Only Joe Root has any sort of defensive technique. \u201d But, hang it! For now let\u2019s be thrilled by the West Indies. By their young bowlers, by Roach, by Holder, by Joseph; their patient batsmen, by Holder again, by Darren Bravo, who single-handedly batted for nearly as long as England\u2019s second-innings. West Indies win The Wisden Trophy and the whole shebang moves to St Lucia. See you there! Good Night! The party is bubbling at the Sir Viv Richards stadium. The West Indies have a cuddle and exchange stumps, Sir Viv in his blue polo shirt and shades applauds enthusiastically from the stands - and Sir Viv doesn\u2019t clap unless he really means it. Jason Holder smiles and smiles and smiles. 3rd over: West Indies 17-0 (Brathwaite 5, Campbell 11) England review an lbw then Campbell pulls Anderson, lofts him, gloriously,over the boundary and that is the West Indies victory!!! West Indies beat England by 10 wickets to take a 2-0 lead in a three match series. 2nd over: West Indies 10-0 (Brathwaite 5, Campbell 5) Campbell clips Broad off his hips for a single, then a tickle for Brathwaite to midwicket for another run. Then Campbell, like a daffodil suddenly bursting into glorious flower, cracks a wide one through the covers, bat finishing up by his shoulder. West Indies need 4 to win. 1st over: West Indies 4-0 (Brathwaite 4, Campbell 0) A boundary from the first ball of Anderson\u2019s over kind of sums up England\u2019s afternoon. A short fat one, cut heartily by Brathwaite. West indies need 10 to win. So, well, hs;odkjs\u2019odfkjg;askdjf;ksghaskdljfa. West Indies, however, were immense. Joe Root is stony-faced on the balcony. But what now exactly? I feel rather for Joe Denly, thrown into the lion\u2019s den. And a killer stat from Jarrod Kimber: \u201cEngland faced 37 more balls than Darren Bravo did in his innings.\u201d Anderson misreads Holder\u2019s slower ball and it falls into the hands of Joseph at mid-off. England are all out for 132 and West Indies need 14 to win. 42nd over: England 132-9 (Anderson 0, Curran 13) Curran pings Roach\u2019s slower ball straight back at him he can\u2019t clasp his hands round the grenade -and it riccochets off to the boundary Did Rome burn to the sound of the Barmy Army singing \u201cWe are the Barmies\u201d? 41st over: England 126-9 (Anderson 0, Curran 7) Anderson and Curran could almost, almost, be father and son. \u201cThings come and go, Sam. Form. Fortune. But one things never changes - if the batsmen don\u2019t get stuck in, we bowlers are shafted.\u201d 40th over: England 125-9 (Anderson 0, Curran 6) That\u2019s four for 46 now for Kemar Roach whose smile could almost sell a back-stop. Peter Moores got sacked for drawing in the West Indies. Just saying. And more discussion on England\u2019s batting: Broad declines to review. He gets turned around by Roach and ball would have cannoned into leg stump. On Sky Atherton ponders that six left-handers make a tasty meal for Roach. 39th over: England 123-8 (Broad 0, Curran 4) Sam Curran. Sam Curran! Sam Curran!! He smashes Holder through the covers to give England the lead. Six big beautiful runs. Buttler reviewed, but it was more in desperation than certainty. Umpire\u2019s call, the ball just brushing the stumps, but as he had been given out on the field, off he goes. . 38th over: England 118-7 ( Buttler 24, Curran 0) Foakes just had time to beautifully clip a ball from Roach to the boundary, before one arrived with his name on. Holder is excellent on his review selection, as well as everything else... Roach sends down one that nips in and raps Foakes on the front pad - not out says the ump, West Indies review straight away and yes - the lights are on and Foakes is on his way. 37th over: England 114-6 ( Buttler 24, Foakes 9) Buttler and Foakes aren\u2019t going to hang around. Boundary or bust is the name of their game. A too-full ball from Holder is sent spinning over mid off by Buttler, then he twists the bat and flicks another four through the leg-side. 36th over: England 106-6 ( Buttler 16, Foakes 9) Ben Foakes, too injured to keep wicket, manages to clop two boundaries from Roach who retaliates with two booming (are there any other sort?) inswingers and hits Foakes on his arm. 35th over: England 98-6 ( Buttler 16, Foakes 1) Holder replaces Gabriel, a run and a leg-bye from it. A few clouds bobble in the bluest of Caribbean skies and the Barmy Army are quieted for now. 34rd over: England 97-6( Buttler 16, Foakes 0) Hark? What it is this? A door closing with a thud, a bolt being pushed into place, the latch falling softly down. Oh, Moeen, that wasn\u2019t so pretty. The ball went straight rather than moving away yet Moeen\u2019s feet stood still, while his bat wafted. 33rd over: England 92-5 ( Buttler 16, Moeen 0) Holder keeps Gabriel going and Buttler just leans into a wide one, knee on the dry Antiguan ground, and drives the ball through extra cover for four. England\u2019s happy-go-lucky twosome, Buttler and Moeen, are now their last line of defence. Robert Wilson is feeling slighted: \u201cHow can you complain about an email drought when every time I send you an epic poem about Gordon Greenidge\u2019s limp, you blithely ignore it? But I\u2019d love an epic poem about Gordon Greenidge\u2019s limp. Anyway: \u201cCeci dit, it\u2019s been a long time since I felt this way about a Windies team. I was a huge fan of the quantum phenomenon that was Chanderpaul and various gravity-defying boy-on-the-burning-deck indivdual heroics in the last decade from the likes of Bravo et al but this is a proper unit. How good a skipper must Holder actually be? And how much does it grease the wheels when you first get the gig as an embryo. If this series gets any better, I\u2019m gonna marry it.\u201d 32nd over: England 88-5 ( Buttler 12, Moeen 0) The radio tells me that in the last seven years, West Indies have only beaten New Zealand (of the major Test nations) in a series. This could change quite soon. A bad shot by Stokes, who was looking to attack, but chose the wrong shot to the wrong ball. Stokes, furious, gloves pulled off in high dudgeon, marches off after dragging a wide one from Roach onto his stumps 31st over: England 88-4 (Stokes 11, Buttler 12) A slightly quieter passage of play in place after tea. Pressure slightly released by Gabriel and Roach - not that they\u2019re bowling badly, just not with quite the intensity of Holder and Joseph. And Buttler leans into a punchy back-foot cover drive and the ball is over the boundary before you can say \u201clarge chips please, no vinegar.\u201d Jimmy Ainsworth has been thinking about Joe Root too: \u201cIn response to David Hindle\u2019s gripe, maybe it\u2019s something to do with England consistently picking their best batsman as skipper, which in turn hurts their batting form?\u201d \u201cA lot of other countries do it as well of course, but if you think of the best captains of the Noughties they were rarely the best batsman - Fleming, Ganguly - or picked as skipper early - Smith and now Holder. \u201cI remain to be convinced that Root is the right choice for me. He was the class clown before being captain and his post-match platitudes don\u2019t sound like he\u2019s able to read the riot act when things go awry.\u201d 30th over: England 79-4 (Stokes 11, Buttler 8) Kemar Roach takes the ball at the other end, Holder giving himself, and Joseph a rest. Then THWACK a back-foot cover drive from Stokes. That\u2019s more like it. 29th over: England 75-4 (Stokes 7, Buttler 8) To Shannon Gabriel, the first over after tea. Imagine a bus bustling, a big hulking routemaster charging down Oxford Street. Buttler plays and misses to the first ball. Ben Stokes is nearly run-out at the non-strikers end to the third. West Indies start with a maiden. They\u2019re back on on the field, hold onto your seats, here we go. England\u2019s sometime batting coach Graham Thorpe is talking on Sky \u201cIt\u2019s the application, then it comes down to your thought process, can you be aggressive and will you be aggressive and, along with that ,you\u2019ve got to have the execution\u201d Hmmm. I hope that\u2019s clear to some of you. England are dining on a light snack of despair and gumption. West Indies on pure adrenalin. Joseph, 2-12; Holder 2-27 were gorgeously good. Nasser Hussain has his plain speaking hat on: \u201cThis next session is the one we\u2019ve come for, if West Indies win this session, they win the match, they win the series, but they\u2019ve got to get past these two. England have got to make sure that drop from Campbell comes back to haunt them. England have to put a stop to this nonsense.\u201d 28th over: England 75-4 (Stokes 7, Buttler 8) One leg bye off Joseph\u2019s over and that\u2019s tea. What a cracking session. If you\u2019ve got a friend with Sky beg your way over for the supper-session, if only to see West Indies bowlers almost back at their glorious pomp. 27th over: England 74-4 (Stokes 7, Buttler 8) Who\u2019d like Jason Holder on their team? Yes, me too. Inswinger, awayswinger, on a tuppence. Buttler is watchful, manages to send one over the boundary but he\u2019s not comfortable. Itchy shirt, cramped trainers. Tat Wood writes from New England, \u201cwhere I\u2019m the only person in a fifty-mile radius who could identify Ian Botham in a police line and, conversely, the one person not to give a toss about Tom Brady. NBC\u2019s showing the Six Nations, forlornly trying to enthuse the septics about a game that isn\u2019t punctuation between adverts. So don\u2019t be downcast: there are people hanging on your every word.\u201d Thank you Tat! Will you be superbowling? 26th over: England 66-4 (Stokes 2, Buttler 0) Joseph is borderline unplayable this afternoon. He\u2019s a 22 year old beanpole, no overt exuberance, not that you would expect it on such a sad day, but just testing spitting ball after testing spitting ball. I\u2019m still thinking about Root - i\u2019ll try and look at statsguru at tea and see what his record pre-captaincy was. This : 25th over: England 61-4 (Stokes 2, Buttler 0) No wickets, no appeals, just another excellent over from Holder. So how about an email ? Sorry about the address problem earlier: David Hindle has a gripe \u201cGiven that England\u2019s woes stem from calamitous batting, and given how this problem has never really gone away for at least 5 years now it\u2019s interesting that Root\u2019s average just dropped below 50, something I\u2019d predicted a long time ago. Why is it no England batsman in the last 60 years could keep their career average over 50 to the end, whilst every other major test nation has had several of their players across multiple eras do just that, in that same time period? Surely this is part of what is wrong with England? Whatever \u201cit\u201d may be? The fact with poor Root is that he is probably nowhere near as good as the early indications of his career suggested. And he got lumped in with 3 other players who are at a quite different level. Not his fault. But nevertheless. What is going on with English batting? This is a 60 year old problem. And one that is almost never talked about. 24th over: England 61-4 (Stokes 2, Buttler 0) Drama, what drama! A wicket! Then a huge lbw appeal against Ben Stokes second ball - the Windies slips charge towards the umpire, but decide not to review. Then Stokes is dropped at third slip by John Campbell. And breathe... A super delivery from Joseph that moves in as Denly decides he\u2019s got the measure of the ball, lifts his arms in the air and the ball clips the top of off stump. 23rd over: England 59-3 (Denly 17, Buttler 0) Denly scrambles three runs off Holder - scrappy but keeping it ticking, tocking, ticking. 22nd over: England 56-3 (Denly 14, Buttler) A huge breakthrough for West Indies, and Joseph didn\u2019t even appeal! England are now in rather a large pile of trouble. And however nervy Denly has been, however inelegant, however wafty -he\u2019s still there while his more illustrious partners have gone on their way By the way if anyone wants to get in touch I\u2019m on tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com or @tjaldred Twitter. A breath of a touch on the ball and a cross Root is on his way. for caught behind against Joe Root... 21st over: England 54-2 (Denly 14, Root 5) Root flicks dangerously at Holder but the acrobatically diving Shane Dowrich can\u2019t get a hand on it and it wobbles over the boundary for four. Then a monstrous, double-handed, lbw appeal against Denly to a ball that nips in. But Holder didn\u2019t have the courage of his convictions - which was lucky as it was very much not out. England trail by 65. 20th over: England 49-2 (Denly 14, Root 0) Denly tries another pull shot, off Alzarri Joseph - DONT DO IT JOE! -it is an unsuccessful and awkward looking as the other four. Joseph bowling beautifully, and unbelievably composed after the death of his mother this morning. Another maiden. 19th over: England 49-2 (Denly 14, Root 0) Holder\u2019s liquid run-up is bootiful to watch. Root pulls away just as Holder is about to release his third ball - very late, but luckily for him Holder is not one to hold a grudge. A maiden. 18th over: England 49-2 (Denly 14, Root 0) England trail by 70. And Denly looks on borrowed time. 17th over: England 49-2 (Denly 14, Root 0) Thanks Nick and hello everyone who hasn\u2019t got anything better to do on a Saturday night than idly browse the OBO. Anyway, that was a killer over from Jason Holder straight after drinks. The first ball went for four leg-byes; Bairstow nearly dragged the second onto his stumps. And the fourth. He finally got himself out to the sixth,with a flamboyant fling at a ball that ducked in. Arghgh - having nearly survived a torrid over, Bairstow\u2019s head is no-where and his stumps are splayed.If you can remember that old advert featuring Ian Botham \u201che\u2019d rather be out driving his Saab\u201d - that. That\u2019s drinks, so with that it\u2019s time for Tanya Aldred, who will be your guide for the rest of the day. Emails to her - Tanya.Aldred.casual@theGuardian.com. 16th over: England 43-1 (Denly 14, Bairstow 8) Bowling change, as Joseph replaces Gabriel. Denly manages to avoid repeating the first innings when he snicked the loosest of looseners through to the keeper, but is beaten by a lovely Joseph away-nipper before wearing a lifter on his hand. Still not easy out there. 15th over: England 43-1 (Denly 14, Bairstow 8) Bairstow jabs a pull off his thigh round the corner and sprints back for a second run, then after missing a cut he plays quite a careful pull from a stinking long-hop just in front of deep backward square, out to the boundary. Just as in the first knock, positivity from Bairstow here. 14th over: England 37-1 (Denly 14, Bairstow 2) Gabriel still steaming in, and he\u2019s opting for a rib-tickling approach, pounding the middle of the track. One stays super low and Denly keeps it from hitting the stumps only with a thick inside edge, then he wafts at a rare full ball and misses with the drive. 13th over: England 37-1 (Denly 14, Bairstow 2) Hell\u2019s teeth that was a dreadful shot by Burns. Bairstow is altogether more circumspect with the remaining five balls of the over, getting off the mark by flicking two into a vacant mid-wicket. Sheesh. Holder brings himself on and strikes first ball, but at the risk of being uncharitable it didn\u2019t have much to do with him. Burns tries to cut a ball far, far too close to cut, and only succeeds in giving Campbell catching practice in the slips. 12th over: England 35-0 (Burns 16, Denly 14) Gabriel is giving off similar grumpy vibes to Anderson earlier. The nip has disappeared from his bowling and the two batsmen are finding it increasingly easy to play him. Just a single from the over. 11th over: England 34-0 (Burns 15, Denly 14) Denly clips pleasantly in front of mid-wicket, not quite timing it perfectly but he picks up another two runs, and as it turns out it was merely a precursor to an absolutely delicious cover drive that he very much did time perfectly, all the way to the cover fence. If you\u2019re an England supporter who believes in fate-tempting look away now...but these two are looking more and more assured. 10th over: England 28-0 (Burns 15, Denly 8) Snorter from Gabriel who turns Burns right round, like a record baby, and he somehow avoids getting bat on the ball. Incidentally, Bairstow is padded up to come in first drop, despite keeping for four sessions. 9th over: England 28-0 (Burns 15, Denly 8) Burns jabs at one from Roach then looks behind him in panicked deja vu, the ball going extremely close to the stumps, much as it did in the first innings. But unlike that innings, it missed the wickets and he survives. 8th over: England 26-0 (Burns 14, Denly 7) Gabriel traps Denly and it looks very, very close: the bowler wants to review it but none of his teammates concur. Looked out at first glance, but Hawkeye confirms it was going a few inches over, so a good decision in the end. Denly looks uncomfortable in the extreme, but then Gabriel lets him off the hook with a wide long-hop that the Kent man cuts with gusto to the boundary. Then once more Denly gets away with one, cuffing an attempted pull straight up in the air, but it plops down just in front of a theoretical square leg. 7th over: England 21-0 (Burns 14, Denly 2) Burns looking a bit more positive: he whips a couple down to fine leg, plays a confident drive straight at extra-cover then times the knickers off a leg-stump half-volley, which fine leg fails to stop. There was a missed cut in there too, but the intent is there. 6th over: England 14-0 (Burns 8, Denly 1) Denly looks a tad skittish, all tip-toes and jerky bat movements. He pulls at one from Gabriel that keeps a little lower than expected and he misses in ugly fashion, but then he connects with one, sends a top edge high, high, high in the air towards fine leg where Brathwaite runs in....and DROPS! Those steeplers are always tricky but he made a complete nonsense of the attempt, misjudging things badly and not getting there quite in time. Gabriel screams then stares at the fielder for a long, long time. Gulp. Meanwhile: mercy, mercy me... 5th over: England 13-0 (Burns 8, Denly 0) Burns plays with soft hands, opening the face very slightly and guiding a thick outside edge down to third man for England\u2019s first boundary off the bat. Roach comes back with the jaffa\u2019s jaffa from the last ball of the over, which misses the edge but does square Burns up rather. The players are back out for the afternoon. You wonder how long West Indies will be able to keep up their barrage of that brief spell before lunch. If they can, this will be a super-spicy session for England. They\u2019re playing highlights of Lara\u2019s 375 in Antigua on Sky. Here\u2019s a piece about that magnificent thing by Vic Marks, who watched from the press box that day. Pretty decent morning for England, really: the lead was only extended by 34 runs, and they\u2019ve reached the break with all their wickets intact. A low bar, perhaps, but that\u2019s frankly where England have set it on this tour so far. 4th over: England 9-0 (Burns 4, Denly 0) Burns takes a Trottian length of time to mark out his guard, just making sure this is the last over before lunch. He plays out the over well, not offering the bat unless he absolutely has to, flapping a single to fine leg and it is indeed the interval. A potentially grim little spell nicely dealt with by the openers. 3rd over: England 8-0 (Burns 3, Denly 0) Roach bowls with a hefty grunt, but Burns deals with him pretty well, nicely flicking a single down to fine leg. Denly shovels one to short-leg which Hetmyer drops, but that was all thigh pad. They go up for an ear-splitting lbw appeal but the angle from which Roach is bowling (wide) that looked like it was heading comfortably down leg. Shrewd call not to review it. 2nd over: England 7-0 (Burns 2, Denly 0) Here\u2019s beefcake Shannon Gabriel to open from the other end, and sends a brutal bouncer towards Burns\u2019s throat which he fends off as best he can, the ball flying to where leg gully would have been. Batting on this track against this pace looks...not fun. Meanwhile, the Antipodean mind games continue, with Justin Rigden: \u201cPlease remind Brian Withington that our bragging rights disappeared with that little scrap of sandpaper last year. I told you England would be batting in half an hour. If they survive until the last session today, it\u2019s game on.\u201d 1st over: England 6-0 (Burns 1, Denly 0) Quite a start from Roach - an absolutely colossal leg side wide gives a scrambling Dowrich no chance at all, and it flies away for five wides. Then the snortiest of snorter bouncers is aimed at Burns\u2019s nose: a brilliant delivery, jagging in as well as being at that lethal length and pace, very well played by Burns who got out of the way, pronto. Burns tucks the first run off the bat just wide of mid-on. They\u2019re out for England\u2019s second innings. How will this water biscuit England top order cope with Roach, Gabriel et al? Great effort by Bravo, though. He reached 50 off 215 balls and in 338 minutes, which makes it the slowest ever half-century by a West Indian and the third slowest in all Test matches. Proper cricket, or something. Tough one for England, then. The bad news is this pitch is becoming more treacherous than the pit of Sarlaac, but the good news is West Indies have shown it\u2019s possible to score some runs if you\u2019re sensible about it. After Bravo brings up his half-century with a single, two balls of the over to go they for some reason take another single after a thump down to long-on by Gabriel. Bravo comes down the pitch to try working another to keep the strike, but just runs past it and Bairstow completes the formalities. 130th over: West Indies 304-9 (Bravo 49, Gabriel 0) Gabriel loses track of what I think was a shorter slower ball, but is again pretty staunchly in behind the rest of Stokes\u2019s over. \u201cPlease advise Justin Ridgen (over 124),\u201d advises Brian Withington, \u201cthat we are on to his canny reverse moxing of this match and the forthcoming Ashes series. Stick to the archetypal Antipodean bragging and sledging whilst leaving us Poms to the gentle deprecatory pursuit of downplaying our teams\u2019 chances on all sporting fronts.\u201d 129th over: West Indies 304-9 (Bravo 49, Gabriel 0) Bit of spin, as Mo Mo Mo Ali replaces Anderson. \u201cLet\u2019s not eff about Mo,\u201d yells a voice from somewhere, I think the crowd rather than the field, but one would think the players will concur. Bravo turns down a single after carving one to the cover sweeper, which is a bit surprising, but then takes a step or two down and smokes a bullet straight six that barely got 10ft above the ground. However he can\u2019t get the single from the final ball which means Stokes, in theory, has an over at Gabriel. 128th over: West Indies 298-9 (Bravo 43, Gabriel 0) England put three slips, a short leg and a leg gully in for Gabriel, but the big man gets in behind the rest of the over from Stokes pretty solidly, ducking under a couple of the shorter balls. Wicket maiden from Stokes though. Ben Stokes is on, and strikes with his very first ball, as Joseph fends one to Rory Burns, who takes a good low catch at third slip. That\u2019s what you call instant impact. 127th over: West Indies 298-8 (Bravo 43, Joseph 7) Joseph takes a rapid single just past point, but speeds in and makes his ground, but the throw misses anyway. Meanwhile here\u2019s a story from Ali Martin about the Hundred, which is going well. 126th over: West Indies 296-8 (Bravo 42, Joseph 6) Joseph fends at a couple of balls from Broad that leap up, inspiring the installation of a short leg. Joseph gets in solidly behind a few, before another pops up but too far ahead of Jennings to be dangerous. Digging in, with Darren Bravo: 125th over: West Indies 296-8 (Bravo 42, Joseph 6) Sheesh what a shot from Joseph: a ball of reasonably full length is thwacked high over Anderson head and it bounces through for a boundary. Bravo then plays a couple of shots that look a bit pointless and wafty, missing both, but then again he\u2019s facing Jimmy Anderson on a minefield of a pitch, so... They\u2019re having a drink. West Indies lead by 104 which, after the first hour, is a result for both teams: them because, well, they lead by 104, but England because they\u2019ve broadly kept the scoring down. 124th over: West Indies 291-8 (Bravo 42, Joseph 1) Joseph plays a nice flick off his pads for a single. The optimistic Justin Rigden from earlier is back on - or, perhaps given his provenance, the pessimistic Justin Rigden. \u201cI am an Australian and did watch England in the 1990s, with a great deal of satisfaction! This is a much better England team than that. They\u2019ll be batting within half an hour - providing the top end are patient, they should make a game of it. They\u2019ll beat Australia this year too.\u201d 123rd over: West Indies 289-8 (Bravo 41, Joseph 0) Applause from all round the stadium as Alzarri Joseph makes his way out to the middle. He leaves one that misses off stump by...not a lot, and then takes one on his pads that England sort of appeal for, but their heart didn\u2019t sound in it. Really, really good catch by Stokes: not a spectacular one really, because he didn\u2019t have to move his feet and just threw his hands up high directly above his head, but a flashed edge from Roach was going at quite a pace. England chipping away now: Anderson and Broad have bowled rather well. 122nd over: West Indies 289-7 (Bravo 41, Roach 6) Bravo wears a nasty lifter from Broad on his bottom hand, and that looked like it bloody hurt. Glove off, hand gets a good shake, then next ball from almost the same length keeps very low and Bravo does brilliantly to jab his bat down in time. Then Broad bowls a couple of what look a lot like cutters, the first beats a defensive push and the next goes wide of a rare expansive shot from Bravo. The Windies have the last laugh (from that over) with a couple of singles. Meanwhile, this is flamboyantly niche... ...and while I\u2019m not trying to explain the joke, any excuse to listen to one of the great songs. 121st over: West Indies 287-7 (Bravo 40, Roach 5) Roach jabs at one outside off and a very thick edge zoots wide of the diving Burns at fourth slip, earning himself (?) a boundary. 120th over: West Indies 282-7 (Bravo 39, Roach 1) You have to admire Kemar Roach\u2019s moxy: he swings absolutely everything at a ball vaguely on a length, misses it by a foot and earns a quizzical look from Broad. 119th over: West Indies 282-7 (Bravo 39, Roach 1) Actually I did Anderson a disservice there: there was plenty of bounce, enough in fact to take Holder\u2019s glove, rather than the bat. Anderson beats Bravo with a couple of absolutely snorting away swingers and, despite his continued grumpiness, looks in a pretty good groove. \u201cEvery time I see England selector Ed Smith in the crowd,\u201d offers Don Wilson, \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to think who he reminds me of. Today I\u2019ve got it, anyone remember 1980\u2019s early CGi Max Headroom?\u201d Judge for yourself... ...although I\u2019ve always had him more as \u2018Young Mick McCarthy if he went to Cambridge.\u2019 Simple stuff. Anderson bowls one just the right width outside off stump, it lifts up just enough and flicks off Holders\u2019s willow through to Bairstow. 118th over: West Indies 281-6 (Bravo 39, Holder 22) There\u2019s a significant change in the field, as Root and Broad bring in a short leg and a sort of leg gully/wide leg slip, with one conventional slip and a gully. Not going to be much full stuff, you\u2019d wager. Incidentally, should probably have mentioned earlier: that short-leg is Keaton Jennings, on the field again for Ben Foakes, so Jonny Bairstow is keeping. Jennings takes a sharp one-handed catch, but off Bravo\u2019s thigh pad. Kandukuru Nagarjun writes: \u201cAlzarri Joseph\u2019s tragedy reminds me of another tragedy involving a Windies player that happened around an Antigua Test. In 1983 against India, the great Gordon Greenidge scored a century, his first for six years. And then flew back home to Barbados to be with his infant daughter battling a kidney infection. Sadly, she succumbed to it two days later.\u201d 117th over: West Indies 281-6 (Bravo 39, Holder 22) Anderson lets out a gutteral scream of irritation as Holder edges between second and third slip, but it dropped about a foot short and in the end Stokes does brilliantly to stop the thing from scooting boundary-wards. Anderson beats the edge two more times, and turns on his heels with what can only be described as a dejected vibe. 116th over: West Indies 280-6 (Bravo 38, Holder 22) Broad hits Bravo above the knee roll and goes up for an appeal that could go in the dictionary as the definition of optimism. That\u2019s what happens when desperation starts to creep in. One single from the over, nudged by Bravo. 115th over: West Indies 279-6 (Bravo 37, Holder 22) Holder leaves one on length, which is about as remarkable an act of faith as you can imagine in cricket. He was right though: just, the ball going about three or four inches over the bails. 114th over: West Indies 278-6 (Bravo 36, Holder 22) Broad gives Bravo a terrific lifter which the batsman does well to keep down but then, in a minor version of the stunt he pulled yesterday, the bowler pointlessly flicks the ball at the stumps, off which it rebounds, and the alert Windies pair skip through for a single. Then a sign of just how much this pitch is falling apart as one on a length leaps up so much that it loops through to the keeper - it was as if the ball had hit a pebble in the middle of the pitch. 113th over: West Indies 277-6 (Bravo 35, Holder 22) Absolute woofer of an in-ducker from Anderson to start, cutting Holder in half and from the sound of things it clipped his box. Then one holds its line and beats the outside edge, and the final ball of the over is the sort of sensational ball that even the best batsmen just has to close his eyes and hope misses the bat, pitching on middle-off and jagging away unplayably. Justin Rigden potentially didn\u2019t grow up watching England in the 1990s, so thus sounds quite chipper. \u201cOf course England will be batting today, the Windies tail is quite fragile. This pitch will be horrendous to bat on last. If England can get a lead of 100 they\u2019re in with a good chance of victory.\u201d 112th over: West Indies 277-6 (Bravo 35, Holder 22) Broad starts largely on the mark, but Holder gets some squirted runs, two down to third man and another one off a thick inside-edge to mid-wicket. Bravo tucks a couple of his own down to fine leg. And we\u2019re away. The Barmy Army, as usual give themselves a hearty round of applause after the semi-tuneless version of Jerusalem. More sad news, from Antigua... As far as I know Joseph - just 22 - will still play, which always I find absolutely extraordinary. The mental fortitude that must take is remarkable. This has nothing to do with sport, never mind cricket, but before play starts read these tributes to Jeremy Hardy, who died this week. \u201cOf course England will be batting at some point today,\u201d says Nick Knight. Don\u2019t be quite so sure about that, Nicholas. What\u2019s the pitch going to be like today? Well, it looks like an eroding cliff, all jagged edges and unexpected crevices. I wouldn\u2019t fancy batting on it, but then again I\u2019m not even a village standard batsman. Batting last on this is going to be spicy, but batting second and third doesn\u2019t look like a picnic either. And here\u2019s Stuart Broad sounding either despondent or rather bullish, depending on how you view things. A quick catch-up from yesterday? Allow Victor Marks to take you through it. Do you think there\u2019s a more frustrated set of sportspeople in the world right now than the England bowling attack? 276/6 isn\u2019t a horrendous score to have conceded in isolation, even without the dropped catches. But of course there are the dropped catches, plus the house of cards collapse of the top order, which has meant that not horrendous score equates to what will soon be a first innings lead of 100, then 150 and most likely 200 plus after that. Naturally England didn\u2019t bowl perfectly, and we\u2019ll get to the West Indies batting prowess in a bit, but if the tourists\u2019 current predicament is anyone specific\u2019s fault, it ain\u2019t the bowlers\u2019. Naturally, the Guardian reserves the right to withdraw this commentary should we get another wicketless day with a whole load of pies sent down. Let\u2019s see.",

      "body": "<p>England have never won a Test in Antigua and their 10th attempt to do so ended rapidly and ignominiously. They were defeated inside three days by 10 wickets. Once again Joe Root\u2019s tourists have been thoroughly outplayed from start to finish. Here was a pale imitation of the 80s and 90s except for the fact that the accepted wisdom before the series was that England were the favourites to win it. Now, with a match to go, Jason Holder\u2019s side are already in proud possession of the Wisden Trophy and how they deserve it.</p> <p>West Indies\u2019 first-innings lead of 119 was more than enough to stay in charge of the game. Where the West Indian batsmen gritted their teeth and grafted, the English ones, disconcerted by a spicy pitch and a disciplined attack, found a variety of ways to be dismissed. Most of the home batsmen had to be bowled out, most of the visitors surrendered to blameless deliveries. Half-volleys were missed, straight balls shunned and of the batsmen only Joe Root was the recipient of a devilish delivery upon dismissal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/02/joe-root-england-west-indies-outplayed-outperformed\">Joe Root: \u2018We came here to win but we have been outplayed, outperformed\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not that the pitch was sleeping. There was still movement for the pacemen on a surface that reflected West Indies\u2019 ambition in this series. There have been some torpid tracks in the recent past here but not on this tour. West Indies were prepared to take on England on lively pitches, confident that their batsmen and bowlers could match the tourists at their own game. And so they have, no matter that England\u2019s opening bowlers share 1,008 wickets between them or that their batsmen are supposed to be accustomed to the moving ball.</p> <p>Once again those batsmen were swept away after England had dispatched the last four West Indies players for 34 runs in the morning. The last man out was Darren Bravo, the solitary West Indian to reach 50 in an innings that exemplified a determination to grind out precious, ugly runs in a manner that was beyond this England lineup.</p> <p>When stumped off Moeen Ali, Bravo had been at the crease for 331 minutes and had recorded the slowest ever half-century by a West Indian and the slowest by any Test cricketer since Mahela Jayawardene against New Zealand in 1998. Here was an example of how an innings of purposeful defence could have a major influence on the outcome of a Test match.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/02/alzarri-joseph-stands-tall-west-indies-death-of-mother\">Alzarri Joseph stands tall for West Indies despite death of his mother</a> </p> </aside>  <p>England\u2019s response was typically harum-scarum. Joe Denly thought his innings was all over before he had scored. And so did everyone else. He tried to pull a short delivery from Shannon Gabriel but he was never in control of the shot. The mis-hit sent the ball slowly in the direction of Kraigg Brathwaite at long leg, the most reliable batsman in the West Indian team, but maybe not the most reliable fielder.</p> <p>Denly was aghast and stopped in the middle of the pitch, preparing for his doleful return to the pavilion. But the wind has been swirling all game; Brathwaite now found himself in a poor position; suddenly he had to dive and the ball escaped his grasp. Denly had been watching and before scurrying down the pitch to register his first run he collided with the bowler, who was now the man aghast.</p> <p>The supreme English optimist might have been tempted to see this aberration as the trigger for a long-awaited turning of the tide. But that would have been wishful thinking. The wickets soon tumbled anyway.</p> <p>After his reprieve Denly delivered a princely square cut and cover drive but it was not long before he watched three batsmen head off disconsolately towards the pavilion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43a38ff32e829b3b90c510b75bc78c015551c960\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43a38ff32e829b3b90c510b75bc78c015551c960/0_274_4864_2918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Root and his teammates trudge off after defeat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Root and his teammates trudge off after defeat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images,</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both Rory Burns and Jonny Bairstow fell to Jason Holder, the slowest of the West Indian quartet but the canniest. Burns had been busy, clipping the ball off his legs adeptly but he offered insufficient respect to Holder\u2019s first delivery. It possessed no demons but it was too close to the body for the cut shot. So he ended up guiding the ball, rather like Trevor Bayliss does in those early morning catching routines, straight into the hands of John Campbell at third slip. It was another cheap dismissal, which had not been a characteristic of the West Indies innings.</p> <p>Out came Bairstow, bristling. He struck two boundaries but there was no air of permanence. His dismissal mirrored that of his first innings. A full-length delivery invited the drive, but aiming to the leg side Bairstow played around the ball and the stumps were disturbed.</p> <p>Now England were 49 for two and the climb back into the game was ever steeper. Root\u2019s first scoring shot, a leg-glance, just eluded the gloves of Shane Dowrich before speeding to the boundary. Then came another masterstroke from Holder in the form of a review. He spotted an inside edge on to the thigh better than the umpire Christopher Gaffaney and the England captain was gone, caught by the keeper, off Alzarri Joseph. The bowler had not bothered to appeal, which was hardly surprising since he was still reeling from the death of his mother, Sharon, overnight. Yet he had chosen to seek solace in the warmth of the West Indies\u2019 dressing room.</p> <p>Then Denly\u2019s second Test innings adventure was over. Once again Joseph was the bowler but the batsman was the culprit. Denly shouldered arms and the ball clattered into his off-stump \u2013 59 for four and the ship was sinking.</p> <p>Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali were bowled driving at Kemar Roach without due care and attention and the tail could not wag. Jos Buttler\u2019s 24 was the highest score, which was more than Keaton Jennings\u2019 17 in the first innings in Barbados. However, no other improvements have been discernible here in Antigua.</p>",

      "bodyText": "England have never won a Test in Antigua and their 10th attempt to do so ended rapidly and ignominiously. They were defeated inside three days by 10 wickets. Once again Joe Root\u2019s tourists have been thoroughly outplayed from start to finish. Here was a pale imitation of the 80s and 90s except for the fact that the accepted wisdom before the series was that England were the favourites to win it. Now, with a match to go, Jason Holder\u2019s side are already in proud possession of the Wisden Trophy and how they deserve it. West Indies\u2019 first-innings lead of 119 was more than enough to stay in charge of the game. Where the West Indian batsmen gritted their teeth and grafted, the English ones, disconcerted by a spicy pitch and a disciplined attack, found a variety of ways to be dismissed. Most of the home batsmen had to be bowled out, most of the visitors surrendered to blameless deliveries. Half-volleys were missed, straight balls shunned and of the batsmen only Joe Root was the recipient of a devilish delivery upon dismissal. Not that the pitch was sleeping. There was still movement for the pacemen on a surface that reflected West Indies\u2019 ambition in this series. There have been some torpid tracks in the recent past here but not on this tour. West Indies were prepared to take on England on lively pitches, confident that their batsmen and bowlers could match the tourists at their own game. And so they have, no matter that England\u2019s opening bowlers share 1,008 wickets between them or that their batsmen are supposed to be accustomed to the moving ball. Once again those batsmen were swept away after England had dispatched the last four West Indies players for 34 runs in the morning. The last man out was Darren Bravo, the solitary West Indian to reach 50 in an innings that exemplified a determination to grind out precious, ugly runs in a manner that was beyond this England lineup. When stumped off Moeen Ali, Bravo had been at the crease for 331 minutes and had recorded the slowest ever half-century by a West Indian and the slowest by any Test cricketer since Mahela Jayawardene against New Zealand in 1998. Here was an example of how an innings of purposeful defence could have a major influence on the outcome of a Test match. England\u2019s response was typically harum-scarum. Joe Denly thought his innings was all over before he had scored. And so did everyone else. He tried to pull a short delivery from Shannon Gabriel but he was never in control of the shot. The mis-hit sent the ball slowly in the direction of Kraigg Brathwaite at long leg, the most reliable batsman in the West Indian team, but maybe not the most reliable fielder. Denly was aghast and stopped in the middle of the pitch, preparing for his doleful return to the pavilion. But the wind has been swirling all game; Brathwaite now found himself in a poor position; suddenly he had to dive and the ball escaped his grasp. Denly had been watching and before scurrying down the pitch to register his first run he collided with the bowler, who was now the man aghast. The supreme English optimist might have been tempted to see this aberration as the trigger for a long-awaited turning of the tide. But that would have been wishful thinking. The wickets soon tumbled anyway. After his reprieve Denly delivered a princely square cut and cover drive but it was not long before he watched three batsmen head off disconsolately towards the pavilion. Both Rory Burns and Jonny Bairstow fell to Jason Holder, the slowest of the West Indian quartet but the canniest. Burns had been busy, clipping the ball off his legs adeptly but he offered insufficient respect to Holder\u2019s first delivery. It possessed no demons but it was too close to the body for the cut shot. So he ended up guiding the ball, rather like Trevor Bayliss does in those early morning catching routines, straight into the hands of John Campbell at third slip. It was another cheap dismissal, which had not been a characteristic of the West Indies innings. Out came Bairstow, bristling. He struck two boundaries but there was no air of permanence. His dismissal mirrored that of his first innings. A full-length delivery invited the drive, but aiming to the leg side Bairstow played around the ball and the stumps were disturbed. Now England were 49 for two and the climb back into the game was ever steeper. Root\u2019s first scoring shot, a leg-glance, just eluded the gloves of Shane Dowrich before speeding to the boundary. Then came another masterstroke from Holder in the form of a review. He spotted an inside edge on to the thigh better than the umpire Christopher Gaffaney and the England captain was gone, caught by the keeper, off Alzarri Joseph. The bowler had not bothered to appeal, which was hardly surprising since he was still reeling from the death of his mother, Sharon, overnight. Yet he had chosen to seek solace in the warmth of the West Indies\u2019 dressing room. Then Denly\u2019s second Test innings adventure was over. Once again Joseph was the bowler but the batsman was the culprit. Denly shouldered arms and the ball clattered into his off-stump \u2013 59 for four and the ship was sinking. Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali were bowled driving at Kemar Roach without due care and attention and the tail could not wag. Jos Buttler\u2019s 24 was the highest score, which was more than Keaton Jennings\u2019 17 in the first innings in Barbados. However, no other improvements have been discernible here in Antigua.",

All that money is earning interest somewhere.

Are we really arguing that the incentive of starting a business is to earn a billion dollars? To earn more money than really is possible to spend?</p> <p>Would a 70% tax rate on earnings over $10m a year really affect anyone\u2019s desire to do work? Or could it be that at that level of money we\u2019re not really talking about incentive to work but desire to accumulate more money in order to accumulate more money?</p> <p>And when the incentives line is done, we are told \u201cbut we need the rich for all their philanthropy\u201d. Ahh yes, sweet benevolence.</p> <p>It is this line that saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/30/historian-berates-billionaires-at-davos-over-tax-avoidance\">historian Rutger Bregman</a> at the Davos World Economic Forum tell a panel \u201calmost no one raises the real issue of tax avoidance ... and of the rich just not paying their fair share ... stop talking about philanthropy and start talking about taxes.\u201d</p> <p>But it is not just tax avoidance, it is tax policies designed to help with wealth accumulation.</p> <p>It is why the argument led by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, that it is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/7.30/scott-morrison-on-creating-more-jobs,-the-banking/10760724\">just fundamental economics 101</a>\u201d that higher taxes weaken the economy, is rather poor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2019/jan/31/liberals-will-run-a-scare-campaign-but-their-age-of-tax-entitlement-must-end\">Liberals will run a scare campaign, but their age of tax entitlement must end | Chris Bowen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It looks at only one side of the budget balance. Yes, if you changed nothing else and increased taxes, that would slow the economy, although by how much depends on what taxes were being raised. But you also need to look at the other side of the ledger. If raising taxes slows economic growth, so too does reducing government expenditure \u2013 and again some expenditure cuts have more economic impact than others.</p> <p>Moreover, we don\u2019t raise or cut taxes \u2013 or government spending \u2013 just to slow or speed up the economy. We do it for a multitude of reasons, from reducing inequality, improving our defence, safety, health and education, or because we think a national broadcaster is a valuable service.</p> <p>The figures the government is spruiking at the moment is an extra $200bn in taxes under the ALP.</p> <p>It sounds a lot, but it is over 10 years and across a number of areas \u2013 such as the treatment of superannuation, discretionary trusts, franking credits, the budget repair levy and a different income tax policy. And many of these taxes will have little impact on economic growth. And crucially, the figure ignores the amount of spending the ALP proposes to do on the other side of the ledger, a key factor of economic growth.</p> <p>The figure also ignores Labor\u2019s own tax cut policies \u2013 for example, their \u201c<a href=\"https://www.chrisbowen.net/media-releases/australian-investment-guarantee-to-deliver-jobs-tax-relief/\">Australian Investment Guarantee</a>\u201d which will allow all businesses to immediately deduct 20% of any new eligible asset worth more than $20,000.</p> <p>A big part of the $200bn is the $70bn extra the government argues will be taxed because the ALP will seek <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/may/31/tax-cuts-are-awful-for-middle-australia-to-pretend-otherwise-is-misleading\">to remove the second and third stages of the tax cuts</a>. But these only come into effect after 2022 and Labor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/10/bill-shortens-budget-promises-from-higher-education-spending-to-a-tax-cut-contest\">has its own tax cuts</a> which actually deliver bigger cuts <a href=\"https://www.alp.org.au/tax_refund_for_working_australians\">to middle-income earners</a>.</p> <p>So it is not surprising the Liberal party is focussing on the removal of franking credit rebates for those who pay no tax (which was the original way dividends were treated until John Howard saw a means to buy some votes) as that would come into effect from July this year.</p> <p>We need to remember what we\u2019re talking about here. It will not hit every retiree. It is the removal of a tax rebate on a dividend you now get despite not paying any tax. You still get the dividend; you just don\u2019t get the rebate.</p> <p>The <a href=\"file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGreg%5CDownloads%5CDividend%20imputation%20credit%20refunds%20-%20further%20information%20PDF%20(3).pdf\">Parliamentary Budget Office estimates</a> that 81% of all these excess franking credits in self-managed funds go to funds with a balance above $1.04m. When you note that the ANZ estimates that the average superannuation balance for someone aged 65-69 is just $207,105, it is clear we are not talking those on the breadline.</p> <p>The level of wealth we are talking about here means this is not even just cutting back on Howard\u2019s \u201cmiddle class welfare\u201d; it is about ending wealthfare \u2013 government policy designed to enrich further the already wealthy.</p> <p>Just as with the \u201coh please, think of the billionaires\u201d line, the government is using the claim that this policy will hurt philanthropy. The treasurer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoshFrydenberg/status/1090763309467353089\">pointed to a submission</a> by Cancer Council Queensland that cited a donor who has given $3.5m and another who donated $600,000 \u201cover several years\u201d who have indicated they are unlikely to continue.</p> <p>Well, that is sad. But you do not pursue a taxation policy in order to fuel donations. Donations are required because of a lack of public funds!</p> <p>The ALP estimates (and the government agrees) this policy will raise around $5.5bn a year. That is a lot of money that can be put to use on health and education or tax cuts for those whose prospective superannuation balances are likely to be well below $1m.</p> <p>We are not at the \u201cevery billionaire is a policy failure\u201d stage. I suspect members of the ALP would be somewhat hesitant to utter the phrase for fear of being labelled socialists (it doesn\u2019t matter, they\u2019ll still be labelled as such).</p> <p>But we need to be honest about wealth \u2013 who has it, how it is accumulated and how government policies such as the franking credits rebates and the flattening of income tax rates actually increase that accumulation.</p> <p>And we need to realise that talk of taxes is not just about economic growth, and economic growth is not just about taxes.</p>",

Or could it be that at that level of money we\u2019re not really talking about incentive to work but desire to accumulate more money in order to accumulate more money? And when the incentives line is done, we are told \u201cbut we need the rich for all their philanthropy\u201d. Ahh yes, sweet benevolence. It is this line that saw historian Rutger Bregman at the Davos World Economic Forum tell a panel \u201calmost no one raises the real issue of tax avoidance ... and of the rich just not paying their fair share ... stop talking about philanthropy and start talking about taxes.\u201d But it is not just tax avoidance, it is tax policies designed to help with wealth accumulation. It is why the argument led by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, that it is \u201cjust fundamental economics 101\u201d that higher taxes weaken the economy, is rather poor. It looks at only one side of the budget balance. Yes, if you changed nothing else and increased taxes, that would slow the economy, although by how much depends on what taxes were being raised. But you also need to look at the other side of the ledger. If raising taxes slows economic growth, so too does reducing government expenditure \u2013 and again some expenditure cuts have more economic impact than others. Moreover, we don\u2019t raise or cut taxes \u2013 or government spending \u2013 just to slow or speed up the economy. We do it for a multitude of reasons, from reducing inequality, improving our defence, safety, health and education, or because we think a national broadcaster is a valuable service. The figures the government is spruiking at the moment is an extra $200bn in taxes under the ALP. It sounds a lot, but it is over 10 years and across a number of areas \u2013 such as the treatment of superannuation, discretionary trusts, franking credits, the budget repair levy and a different income tax policy. And many of these taxes will have little impact on economic growth. And crucially, the figure ignores the amount of spending the ALP proposes to do on the other side of the ledger, a key factor of economic growth. The figure also ignores Labor\u2019s own tax cut policies \u2013 for example, their \u201cAustralian Investment Guarantee\u201d which will allow all businesses to immediately deduct 20% of any new eligible asset worth more than $20,000. A big part of the $200bn is the $70bn extra the government argues will be taxed because the ALP will seek to remove the second and third stages of the tax cuts. But these only come into effect after 2022 and Labor has its own tax cuts which actually deliver bigger cuts to middle-income earners. So it is not surprising the Liberal party is focussing on the removal of franking credit rebates for those who pay no tax (which was the original way dividends were treated until John Howard saw a means to buy some votes) as that would come into effect from July this year. We need to remember what we\u2019re talking about here. It will not hit every retiree. It is the removal of a tax rebate on a dividend you now get despite not paying any tax. You still get the dividend; you just don\u2019t get the rebate. The Parliamentary Budget Office estimates that 81% of all these excess franking credits in self-managed funds go to funds with a balance above $1.04m. When you note that the ANZ estimates that the average superannuation balance for someone aged 65-69 is just $207,105, it is clear we are not talking those on the breadline. The level of wealth we are talking about here means this is not even just cutting back on Howard\u2019s \u201cmiddle class welfare\u201d; it is about ending wealthfare \u2013 government policy designed to enrich further the already wealthy. Just as with the \u201coh please, think of the billionaires\u201d line, the government is using the claim that this policy will hurt philanthropy. The treasurer pointed to a submission by Cancer Council Queensland that cited a donor who has given $3.5m and another who donated $600,000 \u201cover several years\u201d who have indicated they are unlikely to continue. Well, that is sad. But you do not pursue a taxation policy in order to fuel donations. Donations are required because of a lack of public funds! The ALP estimates (and the government agrees) this policy will raise around $5.5bn a year. That is a lot of money that can be put to use on health and education or tax cuts for those whose prospective superannuation balances are likely to be well below $1m. We are not at the \u201cevery billionaire is a policy failure\u201d stage. I suspect members of the ALP would be somewhat hesitant to utter the phrase for fear of being labelled socialists (it doesn\u2019t matter, they\u2019ll still be labelled as such). But we need to be honest about wealth \u2013 who has it, how it is accumulated and how government policies such as the franking credits rebates and the flattening of income tax rates actually increase that accumulation. And we need to realise that talk of taxes is not just about economic growth, and economic growth is not just about taxes.",

On Friday, Big League Politics, a website founded by former employees of the far-right Breitbart News, released the photo. A whirlwind of condemnations followed. Northam quickly and repeatedly apologized. Then, on Saturday, he changed his story. Northam was still taking questions from reporters when the Virginia legislative black caucus (VLBC) reaffirmed its call for him to resign, which it first made after meeting with the governor on Friday. \u201cIn light of his public admission and apology for his decision to appear in the photo, he has irrevocably lost the faith and trust of the people he was elected to serve,\u201d the VLBC said. \u201cChanging his public story today now casts further doubt on his ability to regain that trust.\u201d The Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairman, Tom Perez, said in a statement released during the press conference that he had spoken to Northam in the morning and believed he should step down. \u201cVirginians and people across the country deserve better from their leaders, and it is clear that Ralph Northam has lost their trust and his ability to govern,\u201d Perez said. Before the press conference, calls for Northam\u2019s resignation had poured in from Virginia\u2019s top Democrats and Republicans, as well as the Democratic presidential candidates Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Juli\u00e1n Castro. On Saturday morning, while a small group of protesters stood outside the Virginia governor\u2019s mansion, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders joined the chorus insisting on Northam\u2019s resignation. \u201cThere is no place for racism in America,\u201d former vice-president Biden tweeted. He then offered support for the lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, who is line to take the governorship if Northam resigns. Fairfax, the second black person to be elected to statewide office in Virginia, has not publicly commented on the photograph. Biden said: \u201cGovernor Northam has lost all moral authority and should resign immediately, Justin Fairfax is the leader Virginia needs now.\u201d",

Might he have a point?</p> <p>For example, if we <em>were</em> seeing more frequent cold extremes, would this contradict the theory of human-caused global warming? No. <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-how-is-arctic-warming-linked-to-polar-vortext-other-extreme-weather\" title=\"\">Scientists increasingly think</a> that climate change may cause a more frequent breakdown of the \u201cpolar vortex\u201d of the northern hemisphere (the tight band of winds in the upper atmosphere that, typically, confine the cold North Pole air masses to the Arctic, loosely associated with the jet stream). The amplified warming of the Arctic caused by the melting of sea ice reduces the temperature contrast between the equator and pole. It is that contrast that maintains the polar vortex and jet stream. As the vortex breaks down, the jet stream slows and exhibits broader north-south wiggles, just as a river crossing almost level territory exhibits broad meanders as it snakes its way to the coastline.</p> <p>That makes it easier for pieces of the cold Arctic air masses to break off and wobble down into middle-latitude continental regions such as North America and Europe, precisely what happened with the recent cold air outbreak in the US. But let\u2019s return to the other first question: are we seeing an increase in record cold? So far, in the first month of 2019, two all-time cold records were set \u2013 in towns in Illinois. Meanwhile, there have been <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2192369-so-far-2019-has-set-35-records-for-heat-and-2-for-cold/\" title=\"\">35 all-time records for heat</a> (many of them set in the extreme summer heatwave that is <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/31/asia/australia-heat-wave-analysis-intl/index.html\" title=\"\">baking Australia</a> and scorching cities such as Adelaide). That\u2019s a ratio of 18 hot records to each cold record.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b62c47baa95260fabb18a10ad7ecb4673ca5171\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b62c47baa95260fabb18a10ad7ecb4673ca5171/0_155_2072_1243/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Mann says climate deniers have \u2018weaponised ignorance\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Mann says climate deniers have \u2018weaponised ignorance\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the absence of planetary warming, that ratio should be one to one.

The extreme European heatwave last summer was, according to one such estimate, made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/27/heatwave-made-more-than-twice-as-likely-by-climate-change-scientists-find\" title=\"\">twice as likely</a> by human-caused climate change.

The former youth worker, who has fostered 27 children for the London borough of Tower Hamlets over the past 14 years, was recently given the Fostering Network\u2019s president\u2019s award for her contribution to care. \u201cI love what I do,\u201d she said. \u201cI came into it with my eyes open. But I don\u2019t think most people realise how hard foster carers work for the allowance we receive.\u201d The under-reported pressures and frustrations of Britain\u2019s foster carers are spelled out today in a report by the Fostering Network, seen by the Observer, which portrays a sector on the verge of crisis and warns that, unless conditions for carers improve, some of the most vulnerable children could pay the price. The State of the Nation\u2019s Foster Care report found that while 58% of carers felt they were treated as an equal and valued member of the team by their foster child\u2019s social worker, a quarter were not sure what day-to-day decisions they had the authority to make and a significant number did not feel able to make decisions that had been delegated to them.

This is a regime that has had 20 years to buy the loyalty of the cornerstone of Venezuelan politics, which is the armed forces. Unless that changes, I just don\u2019t see a transition,\u201d he said. Eva Golinger, a US writer and former Ch\u00e1vez ally who first met Maduro about 15 years ago, said it was impossible to predict what might come next: \u201cEvery day is a new day.\u201d</p> \n<p>But she also doubted that Maduro \u2013 who continues to enjoy the backing of Russia and China, as well as the military \u2013 was about to fall. \u201cThere is certainly concern [within Maduro\u2019s administration]. But I\u2019m not seeing a weakening in the government to the point at which the dozen or so in Maduro\u2019s circle are going to give it up. There is no sign of that. They are not planning on relinquishing power,\u201d Golinger said.</p> \n<p>Guaid\u00f3 begs to differ. At the unveiling of an opposition blueprint for Venezuela\u2019s rescue on Thursday, he was inundated by members of the media and hundreds of admirers who now lionise him as a potential saviour. \u201cWe are in the streets and we will remain in the streets until the usurpation ends,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 declared, urging people to join what he called \u201cthe biggest march in the history of Venezuela and our continent\u201d, yesterday.</p> \n<p>Jos\u00e9 Toro Hardy, a Venezuelan economist who helped devise the economic recovery plan, said \u201cvery specific historical circumstances\u201d meant the stars had aligned for those seeking change. In particular, unambiguous support from Donald Trump means Maduro\u2019s position is under threat.</p> \n<p>\u201cVenezuela has been driving the wrong way down the highway of life and we must take the right direction again,\u201d Hardy said.</p> \n<p>Golinger said she was troubled by Trump\u2019s apparent resolve to remove Maduro and feared failure to achieve that through political pressure could lead to military action. \u201cIt would be hard to see this administration \u2013 that is so much into winning \u2013 take this as a loss and not get Maduro out. That would be a huge defeat for Trump. I can\u2019t even imagine. I think he would send in the troops.\u201d</p> \n<p>That, Ramsey warned, would not only be a logistical nightmare for the US but \u201cultimately a bloodbath\u201d.</p> \n<p>Protesters like Bellor\u00edn and Gonz\u00e1lez said they were aware of the potential dangers and hoped Maduro agreed to step down. \u201cNobody in this country is prepared for a war,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said.</p> \n<p>On the eve of yesterday\u2019s protests, Maduro visited a special-forces training ground with defence minister, Vladimir Padrino, to oversee a parade of anti-riot troops. \u201cWe are facing a historic battle,\u201d Maduro said. \u201cThe greatest political, diplomatic and economic aggression Venezuela has faced in 200 years.</p> \n<p>\u201cI will stand firm and I can tell you that we will win.\u201d Maduro then shouted what has become the refrain of his epic struggle to retain power: \u201cAlways loyal!\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cNever traitors!\u201d the troops bellowed back. That message was undermined just hours later by Yanez\u2019s announcement on social media that he was abandoning Maduro.</p> \n<p>Gonz\u00e1lez, the student leader, said he was certain more would follow: \u201cNo one follows a corpse into the grave.\u201d</p> \n<p>Juan Guaid\u00f3 is described as an American puppet waging an illegal coup against their Bolivarian revolution, by the president\u2019s allies.</p> \n<p>\u201cA whippersnapper,\u201d top chavista Diosdado Cabello scoffed last week.</p> \n<p>Guaid\u00f3\u2019s Twitter profile describes him as a civil servant and engineer \u2013 as well as interim president of the republic.</p> \n<p>But for millions of despairing people, the 35-year-old is a source of hope. Just 15 when \u201cEl Comandante\u201d Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was first elected in 1998, Guaid\u00f3 is from La Guaira, a port city just north of the capital, and belongs to Voluntad Popular (Popular Will) a centrist opposition party.</p> \n<p>He took his first steps into politics in 2007, during anti-Ch\u00e1vez protests, and was taken under the wing of Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, one of the country\u2019s best-known and most combative opposition leaders.</p> \n<p>With L\u00f3pez under house arrest it has fallen to Guaid\u00f3 \u2013 first elected in 2015 but virtually unknown until he became head of the opposition-run national assembly in early January - to lead the latest attempt to unseat Maduro. On 23 January, he declared himself interim president based on an article of the constitution he says permits him to claim leadership if the presidency is left \u201cvacant\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have woken up from a nightmare to dream of a better country,\u201d he told supporters last week. Many are now banking on him to build just that.</p>",

Eva Golinger, a US writer and former Ch\u00e1vez ally who first met Maduro about 15 years ago, said it was impossible to predict what might come next: \u201cEvery day is a new day.\u201d But she also doubted that Maduro \u2013 who continues to enjoy the backing of Russia and China, as well as the military \u2013 was about to fall. \u201cThere is certainly concern [within Maduro\u2019s administration]. But I\u2019m not seeing a weakening in the government to the point at which the dozen or so in Maduro\u2019s circle are going to give it up. There is no sign of that. They are not planning on relinquishing power,\u201d Golinger said. Guaid\u00f3 begs to differ. At the unveiling of an opposition blueprint for Venezuela\u2019s rescue on Thursday, he was inundated by members of the media and hundreds of admirers who now lionise him as a potential saviour. \u201cWe are in the streets and we will remain in the streets until the usurpation ends,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 declared, urging people to join what he called \u201cthe biggest march in the history of Venezuela and our continent\u201d, yesterday. Jos\u00e9 Toro Hardy, a Venezuelan economist who helped devise the economic recovery plan, said \u201cvery specific historical circumstances\u201d meant the stars had aligned for those seeking change. In particular, unambiguous support from Donald Trump means Maduro\u2019s position is under threat. \u201cVenezuela has been driving the wrong way down the highway of life and we must take the right direction again,\u201d Hardy said. Golinger said she was troubled by Trump\u2019s apparent resolve to remove Maduro and feared failure to achieve that through political pressure could lead to military action. \u201cIt would be hard to see this administration \u2013 that is so much into winning \u2013 take this as a loss and not get Maduro out. That would be a huge defeat for Trump. I can\u2019t even imagine. I think he would send in the troops.\u201d That, Ramsey warned, would not only be a logistical nightmare for the US but \u201cultimately a bloodbath\u201d. Protesters like Bellor\u00edn and Gonz\u00e1lez said they were aware of the potential dangers and hoped Maduro agreed to step down. \u201cNobody in this country is prepared for a war,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said. On the eve of yesterday\u2019s protests, Maduro visited a special-forces training ground with defence minister, Vladimir Padrino, to oversee a parade of anti-riot troops. \u201cWe are facing a historic battle,\u201d Maduro said. \u201cThe greatest political, diplomatic and economic aggression Venezuela has faced in 200 years. \u201cI will stand firm and I can tell you that we will win.\u201d Maduro then shouted what has become the refrain of his epic struggle to retain power: \u201cAlways loyal!\u201d \u201cNever traitors!\u201d the troops bellowed back. That message was undermined just hours later by Yanez\u2019s announcement on social media that he was abandoning Maduro. Gonz\u00e1lez, the student leader, said he was certain more would follow: \u201cNo one follows a corpse into the grave.\u201d Juan Guaid\u00f3 is described as an American puppet waging an illegal coup against their Bolivarian revolution, by the president\u2019s allies. \u201cA whippersnapper,\u201d top chavista Diosdado Cabello scoffed last week. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s Twitter profile describes him as a civil servant and engineer \u2013 as well as interim president of the republic. But for millions of despairing people, the 35-year-old is a source of hope. Just 15 when \u201cEl Comandante\u201d Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was first elected in 1998, Guaid\u00f3 is from La Guaira, a port city just north of the capital, and belongs to Voluntad Popular (Popular Will) a centrist opposition party. He took his first steps into politics in 2007, during anti-Ch\u00e1vez protests, and was taken under the wing of Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, one of the country\u2019s best-known and most combative opposition leaders. With L\u00f3pez under house arrest it has fallen to Guaid\u00f3 \u2013 first elected in 2015 but virtually unknown until he became head of the opposition-run national assembly in early January - to lead the latest attempt to unseat Maduro. On 23 January, he declared himself interim president based on an article of the constitution he says permits him to claim leadership if the presidency is left \u201cvacant\u201d. \u201cWe have woken up from a nightmare to dream of a better country,\u201d he told supporters last week. Many are now banking on him to build just that.",

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s that, on the day Norwich go top at the expense of Leeds. Paul Doyle was our man at Elland Road. Enjoy his report. Night night! Farke speaks! \u201cIt was a close game. They started well, but I think it was totally deserved that we led at half time. On the counter we had better chances. We had some problems with our pressing and we spoke about it at half-time. It was totally better in the second half. We didn\u2019t give them once chance. We are annoyed to concede a goal in the last minute from a corner that was not a corner! During the second half we controlled the game. I am pretty pleased.\u201d Bielsa, whose side have lost five of their last seven, talks: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t take our positive moments in the first half hour. We made mistakes in front of our box and helped Norwich to make chances. After they scored, it was hard for us to recover the ball. The way Norwich used the ball in the second half made it difficult for us. It was hard to play deep and attack constantly. This is an indication that the team is not doing very well right now.\u201d So that\u2019s taken Norwich top of the table on goal difference. Norwich and Leeds both have 57 points, in the automatic promotion places and ahead of Sheffield United, three points behind in third. West Bromwich Albion, Middlesbrough and in-form Bristol City take up the rest of the play-off places. It\u2019s going to be one heck of a run-in! Speaking of composure, Krul went looking for Bamford after the final whistle. A shove in the chest, followed by a lunge with his head that thankfully didn\u2019t connect. Not sure what that was all about. Krul ended up having a barney with his team-mate Zimmermann, too, as the big defender tried to pull his keeper away from bother and get him calmed down. Imagine what he\u2019d have been like had Norwich lost. Leeds had plenty of possession, but Norwich were by far the superior side. Composed and clinical. The Canaries replace the hosts at the top of the Championship, and on this form will take some stopping. 90 min +3: Leeds spend a bit of time inside the Norwich half, but never look like finding the killer pass that\u2019d set up a very surreal final 60 seconds. Bamford, not to be denied, flashes a header past Krul. A consolation of sorts on a disappointing evening for Leeds. 90 min +1: In the first of four added minutes, Roofe storms down the right and hooks one to the far post, where Bamford sidefoots towards the top right. Krul tips onto the crossbar and out for a corner. From which ... 89 min: It\u2019s top against bottom next Sunday. Norwich will host a certain side from Suffolk, who lost in the last minute to Sheffield Wednesday today. \u201cAre you watching, Ipswich Town?\u201d enquire the travelling support. They will be watching, and on this very impressive evidence, won\u2019t be much looking forward to the derby. 88 min: McLean\u2019s first contribution is to win a corner down the right. It comes to nothing. 87 min: Jordan Rhodes comes on for Teemu Pukki, Norwich having made all three of their changes with clock-management very much in mind. 86 min: Leeds raise the tempo - too little, too late - and Forshaw is clipped by Vrancic. A free kick, out on the left. Jansson sends it in for Ayling, who clanks a header wide left from close range. 85 min: And now Kenny McLean comes on for the impressive Emiliano Buendia. 84 min: Tom Trybull is replaced by Alexander Tettey. 83 min: Stiepermann is booked for repeated fouling. 82 min: Hernandez dribbles his way into the box down the right. He slips and loses possession. But Stiepermann reclaims it, and gives the ball back to Hernandez, who pulls a shot across the face of goal and out to the left. 80 min: Clarke takes a shot at the spectacular from a tight position on the right. It\u2019s not Leeds\u2019 evening though. There was still time. Not now. Douglas dithers and is stripped by Pukki, who slips Lewis away down the left. Lewis\u2019s pullback breaks to Vrancic, ten yards out, level with the left-hand post. Vrancic shoots towards the bottom right; his shot takes a deflection off Douglas, bobbles under Casilla, and goes in. 76 min: Bamford, Klick and Clarke triangulate at speed, and prettily, down the inside-right channel and into the Norwich box. Clarke slams a low cross towards Alioski, who hopes to slide home from six yards. But Aarons is in situ to slide in himself, and hook clear of danger. That was the best Leeds move of the match, and may give them some succour going into the closing stages. There\u2019s still time. 74 min: He\u2019s quite happy to book Alioski, though, for a foul on Vrancic. In fact, that could easily have been, probably should have been, a red card, as studs met shin. It wasn\u2019t a good challenge at all. 73 min: But Douglas is treading a fine line, because he clatters into Buendia again. The referee makes do with a three-strikes warning. 72 min: Buendia drops a shoulder to make good down the right wing, but is stopped by Douglas\u2019s cynical leg. Douglas would probably have been booked, were it not for Buendia\u2019s internationally recognised mime for a yellow card. The ref\u2019s not having that. 70 min: This is a little better from Leeds, as Klich, Clarke and Douglas shuttle the ball right to left, across the face of the Norwich box. Bamford suddenly has a little space to stride into the box, but his shot from a tight angle is blocked out by Godfrey. The resulting corner comes to nothing. 68 min: A little bit of space for Alioski down the left, but his cross batters first man Aarons. Leeds have been a complete non-event since the restart. 66 min: And now he\u2019s jumping around, throwing semaphore shapes in a hot funk, Norwich having been awarded a throw when the ball had clearly come off Aarons. But it\u2019s in the midfield, where it matters little, and he\u2019s just been booked. He needs to take care. The referee has a quiet word. 65 min: Roofe is booked for a frustrated hack at Vrancic, who had just taken the ball off him. 64 min: This should have been game, set and match for Norwich. Onel Hernandez dribbles down the left, reaches the byline, turns Jansson this way then that, and finally chips one back towards the penalty spot. Alioski should clear, but decides to spin with a view to striding off into space. He\u2019s immediately robbed by Aarons, who has space on the spot but drives a wild effort wide right from close range. On the touchline, Bielsa shakes his head sadly. 63 min: The last throw of the dice for Leeds, with just over an hour gone, as Patrick Bamford comes on for Tyler Roberts. 62 min: Alioski sails in from the left, exchanges passes with Forshaw, and looks to shape one into the bottom right from the edge of the box. But it\u2019s all too careful, without much in the way of power, and Krul gathers easily. 60 min: Douglas passes long down the middle. Roofe skitters in from the right. He feels Lewis breathing down his neck and opts to go to ground. He claims a penalty; Norwich are incensed at what they consider a dive. Krul and Roofe discuss the matter during a full and frank exchange. 58 min: Vrancic fouls Roberts, 40 yards from goal on the right. Douglas whips a flat free kick into the Norwich area, but nobody can get a head on it and the ball flies straight into the arms of Krul. The smallest of touches there could have caused Norwich all sorts of bother. 56 min: Vrancic, in full flight down the inside-left channel, is brought to an unceremonious halt by Cooper. Free kick, 35 yards out. Buendia lumps it into the Leeds box, an easy pick for Casilla. A bit of a waste. 54 min: The Elland Road faithful are doing their level best to spark their team into life. It\u2019s bedlam. It\u2019s also all a bit slow. That is until Clarke runs at Lewis down the right with twinkle toes, and nearly finds Roofe in the centre with his low cross. Norwich hack clear. Clarke looks a real prospect. 52 min: Roberts is booked for a fairly cynical late clip on Aarons, who was haring down the right wing. He can\u2019t really complain, and doesn\u2019t bother. 51 min: A lull, which is not really what Leeds need. 49 min: Stiepermann climbs all over Douglas\u2019s back. He should be getting booked, really, but the referee takes pity on him because while subsequently falling to the floor, he\u2019s taken a proper whack in his special area. Ooyah, oof, that\u2019s gotta hurt. 47 min: Leeds have won 20 points from losing positions this season, so they will embrace this task with hope. Clare has his first run of the afternoon down the right, but doesn\u2019t really threaten Lewis. Leeds get the second half underway. They\u2019ve made a double change at half-time, hooking Pablo Hernandez and Jack Harrison and replacing them with Barry Douglas and the exceptional young talent of Jack Clarke. Half-time advertisement. There\u2019ll be more goals in this, I\u2019ll be bound. Don\u2019t go anywhere! 45 min: Roofe is fouled by Trybull, out on the right wing. Alioski scoops the free kick into the mixer. Krul flaps, and the ball drops to Ayling, who dinks it back over the keeper and into the net! But it won\u2019t count, because Jansson was in the thick of it, shoving Vrancic to the floor. 43 min: Roberts ghosts in from the left and is then shoved lightly in the back by Trybull. He wants a penalty, but he\u2019s not getting it. It would have been soft, but Trybull made contact there, and will feel fortunate to have gotten away with that one. 42 min: Pukki is brought to ground by Cooper as he dances his way down the inside-right channel. Leeds are all over the shop here. This is a free kick in a dangerous position. Vrancic tries to repeat his early heroics, but in looking for the top right again, sends the set piece sailing wide. 40 min: The corner leads to nothing. But Norwich regain possession soon enough, Stiepermann flicking Lewis into acres down the left. Lewis flashes the ball hard across the face of goal; it deflects back to Buendia, who leans back and welts over, Leeds breathing again. 38 min: But that second goal has taken the wind out of the Leeds sails. It was met with almost disbelieving silence. Onel Hernandez shoots from the edge of the Leeds D, and the ball balloons out for a corner on the right. 36 min: Straight from kick-off, Roofe embarks on a mesmeric dribble down the inside-left channel, making it into the area. But another goal for the ages is denied us, his eventual shot blocked. This is some game! Well this is farcical. Buendia nicks the ball off a dithering Forshaw. He sets up Vrancic, who shoots low and hard towards the bottom right. But the ball takes a big deflection off Jansson; the sting off the ball, it pings wide right of the stranded Casilla, gifting Pukki the simple task of rolling into the empty net! Leeds had been applying almost relentless pressure in search of an equaliser, and now look! 33 min: Buendia embarks on a Bestian left-to-right dribble across the face of the Leeds box. It\u2019s a hell of a run, but the Leeds back line, sliding around in the slapstick style, does just enough to deny the Norwich trickster space for a shot. For a second, we were promised a goal for the ages. 32 min: Leeds continue to press Norwich back, to little effect. A little frustration made vocal by the home fans. 30 min: Space for Klich out on the right. He wedges diagonally into the Norwich box, dropping the ball on Roofe\u2019s head. Roofe tries to guide a header into the top right from just inside the area; it\u2019s ambitious and wide right. 28 min: The resulting free kick doesn\u2019t come to much. Forshaw sends a shot flying harmlessly off target. 26 min: Fernandez knocks a bouncing ball down the inside-left channel. Roberts looks to be in, but Krul races out of his area to get in the road. Roberts loops the ball over him but sends it wide left of the target. However he\u2019s then clattered by Krul. It\u2019s not exactly Schumacher-Battiston at Espana 82, but it\u2019s a yellow card nonetheless. And a free kick in a dangerous position. 25 min: Jansson\u2019s arm catches Stiepermann under his hipster chin. The Norwich man goes down, looking for a free kick and perhaps the issue of a yellow card, but he\u2019s not getting it. Then it\u2019s Jansson\u2019s turn to have a claim turned down, as he goes to ground easily while challenging for a high ball in the Norwich area with Zimmermann. No penalty. 23 min: Norwich can\u2019t get out of their half. Pukki is on his own and unable to hold the ball up, constantly swarmed by white shirts. Bielsa\u2019s team are playing at trademark full pelt. 21 min: Harrison drives down the right and very nearly makes it into the area, but he can\u2019t quite make himself space to shoot. Norwich clear, though the pressure on them is ramping up: exactly half of the match so far has been played in their final third. 19 min: Corner for Leeds out on the right. Alioski takes. Jansson flicks the ball on towards Roofe, but the striker can\u2019t connect with a lunge at the far post. Goal kick. But here\u2019s a wild prediction: this match won\u2019t end 0-1. 17 min: This is simply wonderful high-octane nonsense. Stiepermann dribbles down the inside-left and looks to have been upended by Roberts to the left of the D. But his fall is theatrical and he diddles himself out of the free kick. Up the other end, Forshaw and Pablo Hernandez take turns to batter long-distance shots off target. 15 min: Space for Alioski out on the left. He hooks into the middle, and Hernandez slices a dreadful clearance straight at Forshaw. Zimmermann is forced to nip in and blooter out for a corner. But Hernandez makes up for his mistake with some determined pressing as Leeds play the set piece towards Klich, and the pressure puts an end to the Leeds attack. 13 min: This was nearly a sensational goal! Harrison reaches the byline out on the right wing. He hoicks a cross back into the area. Alioski, coming in deep from the left, meets the dropping ball first time, and flashes an unstoppable low drive towards the bottom right. But it\u2019s inches wide of the post. Krul was nowhere. 12 min: So anyway, the corner. Nothing to write home about, Hernandez sending one high into the stand. 10 min: A corner for Norwich out on the right. Stiepermann prepares to take. Before he does, Pukki ends up on the floor, Alioski pushing him in the face. Pukki had shoved him first, mind, and doesn\u2019t make a big deal of it when he gets up. Still, had the referee seen that, the Leeds defender would surely have been walking. Lucky that Pukki clearly just saw it as a bit of rough and tumble, the pair embracing before the referee arrived on the scene. 8 min: Roberts responds with a shimmy and shake down the inside-right channel, but his eventual shot doesn\u2019t have much power in it, and Krul swallows it up. 7 min: Buendia dribbles in from the right and sets up Hernandez for a shot from the edge of the box. But Hernandez hesitates, and the chance is quickly gone. Leeds seem a bit shocked at the early goal; they\u2019ll need to wake up smartish because they were almost opened up there. Buendia pretends to shoot. But Vrancic takes it instead. And curls it delightfully over the wall, into the top right! Casilla had no chance! The ball brushed Forshaw\u2019s back as it went past the wall, in fact, but it didn\u2019t really change the path of the free kick, which was beautifully delivered. 4 min: Hernandez launches Norwich\u2019s first attack, dribbling directly towards the Leeds area. He panics Jansson into a clumsy clip, and that\u2019s a free kick in a central position, just outside the box. 3 min: Roberts picks up a loose ball in the middle of the park and drives forward. He slips a pass wide right for Harrison, who shifts it back inside and shoots low and hard. Krul gathers. Leeds have flown out of the blocks. 2 min: Alioski takes a finger in the eye from Buendia. Accidental, but a free kick out on the left and a chance to load the Norwich box. Cooper launches it forward, Ayling cushions it down for Klich, and the Leeds midfielder sends a wild shot into the stand behind. That\u2019s warmed the crowd up even further, though. Here we go, then! Norwich get the ball rolling ... after a false start, Roofe sprinting into their half before the whistle. A second kick-off gets the game underway. The teams are out! Leeds United play in the famous snow-white shirts favoured by the Don, while Norwich are in their first-choice canary yellow. A rare old atmosphere at Elland Road. We\u2019ll be off in a minute. Incidentally, it\u2019s worth pointing out that, after the completion of this afternoon\u2019s 3pm kick-offs, Norwich have dropped to third. They\u2019re now behind Sheffield United, who beat Bolton Wanderers 2-0 today, on goal difference. So a draw will take Norwich back into second; a two-goal win would send them top. Daniel Farke talks! \u201cIt is a spotlight game with lots of attention. But just three points. OK, if we win this game we will be top but it\u2019s not like we\u2019ll have won the title. And if we lose it\u2019s not as though we need to be concerned about relegation. We don\u2019t have to put too much on this game. We face a difficult task and have full respect, but we will be competitive as well.\u201d Then it\u2019s the turn of Marcelo Bielsa, who cuts straight to the chase. \u201cIn the first game we played, we were very efficient but Norwich were not that efficient.\u201d Pre-match entertainment. A treat for us all, but especially for Onel Hernandez. Leeds make two changes to the team that won 2-1 at Rotherham United last week. Pontus Jansson and Tyler Roberts take the places of Kalvin Phillips and Jack Clarke. Barry Douglas and Patrick Bamford return from injury and take up places on the bench. Norwich meanwhile name the same XI sent out for the 2-2 draw with Sheffield United. Leeds United: Casilla, Ayling, Jansson, Cooper, Alioski, Forshaw, Hernandez, Roberts, Klich, Harrison, Roofe. Subs: Peacock-Farrell, Douglas, Bamford, Phillips, Shackleton, Clarke, Gotts. Norwich City: Krul, Aarons, Zimmermann, Godfrey, Lewis, Vrancic, Trybull, Emi, Stiepermann, Hernandez, Pukki. Subs: Rhodes, McLean, Tettey, Hanley, Srbeny, McGovern, Cantwell. Referee: Stuart Attwell (Warwickshire). First versus second. Yes, yes, these top-of-the-table clashes sometimes fail to live up to expectations. But this one has all the makings of a doozy. We already know the team Marcelo Bielsa is going to send out. He named it three days ago, as is often his wont. Casilla, Ayling, Jansson, Cooper, Alioski, Forshaw, Harrison, Klich, Roberts, Hernandez, Roofe. Signs of a man confident in his charges. And no wonder: Leeds are three points clear at the top of the Championship table and looking good for a return to the top flight for the first time since 2004, despite a recent blip in which they\u2019ve lost three from five. But second-placed Norwich are going great guns as well. They\u2019ve won ten and drawn six of their last 17 league matches, and are unquestionably the entertainers of the division. This season they\u2019ve been involved in a 3-3, a 3-2, a 4-1, a 4-0 and no less than four 4-3s. And in their last match, they drew 2-2 with Sheffield United in another top-of-the-table fixture. More, please! Leeds will be confident enough, having beaten Norwich 3-0 at Carrow Road earlier this season. The Canaries have won just one of their last nine games at Elland Road. Their man Pablo Hernandez is the division leader in assists. But Norwich will take heart from their recent form on the road: they\u2019re unbeaten in a dozen matches away from their Norfolk nest. And Teemu Pukki is in a rich vein of form, having scored 12 times in the last 14 matches, and setting up another four goals for good measure. Here\u2019s to some prime-time Saturday night light entertainment, then. Who needs Pointless Celebrities or Dermot\u2019s Small Fortune? Not us. Because it\u2019s on! Kick off\u2019s at 5.30pm GMT.",

Surprising he stayed on so long.</p> <p><strong>1. CIAN HEALY 7/10</strong> Was on hand to score a close-range try when Ireland really needed some points but could not break the shackles for one of his trademark gallops.</p> <p><strong>2. RORY BEST 5/10 (capt) </strong>Not a day to remember for the skipper. He got away with a poor lineout near his own line in the first half but did not impose himself.</p> <p><strong>3. TADHG FURLONG 7/10 </strong>Not enough of Ireland\u2019s world class players lived up to their star billing. Furlong perhaps got closest but England\u2019s aggressive defence restricted his influence.</p> <p><strong>4. DEVIN TONER 5/10 </strong>His run of consecutive wins comes to an end at 17. Is an obvious weapon at the lineout and was committed as ever but made way midway through the second half.</p> <p><strong>5. JAMES RYAN 6/10 </strong>His titanic tussle with Itoje lived up to its billing but he normally makes more headway with the ball in hand than this.</p> <p><strong>6. PETER O\u2019MAHONY 6/10 </strong>Ireland\u2019s man of the match against the All Blacks rolled up his sleeves but could not influence the breakdown, nor the lineout as he tends to.</p> <p><strong>7, JOSH VAN DER FLIER 5/10 </strong>Ireland\u2019s joint top tackler never gave up but Joe Schmidt may rue his decision to name Sean O\u2019Brien \u2013 more suited to this kind of contest \u2013 on the bench.</p> <p><strong>8. CJ STANDER 5/10 </strong>Did well to create enough doubt as to ensure Mako Vunipola\u2019s try was disallowed. Some bruising carries but could not make the same impact as at Twickenham last year.</p> <p><strong>REPLACEMENTS</strong> <strong>Sean Cronin</strong> (for Best 67) <strong>6</strong>; <strong>Dave Kilcoyne</strong> (for Healy 62) <strong>6</strong>; <strong>Andrew Porter </strong>(for Furlong 62) <strong>5</strong>; <strong>Quinn Roux</strong> (for Toner 57) <strong>5</strong>; <strong>Sean O\u2019Brien</strong> (for Stander 65) <strong>6</strong>; <strong>John Cooney</strong> (for Murray 77) <strong>7</strong>; <strong>Joey Carbery </strong>(for Ringrose 73) <strong>N/A</strong>;</p> <p><strong>Jordan Larmour</strong> (for Earls h-t) No sign of his electric footwork <strong>5</strong>.</p> <h2>England</h2> <p><strong>15. ELLIOT DALY 7/10 </strong>Still not convincing under the high ball and was at fault in the buildup to Ireland\u2019s try. Clever grubber for his own score though. A mixed bag.</p> <p><strong>14. JACK NOWELL 8/10 </strong>Always coming off his wing, always looking for work. Got his shot at openside too, joining the scrum with Tom Curry in the sin-bin.</p> <p><strong>13. HENRY SLADE 9/10 </strong>Backed up Farrell with some shrewd kicks, excelled defensively and topped with off with a wonderful pass for his first try. Best performance for England by some distance.</p> <p><strong>12. MANU TUILAGI 7/10 </strong>First start in the competition since 2013 and begin as if to make up for lost time with two big carries shortly before May\u2019s try. Was used sparingly but can make inside-centre his home.</p> <p><strong>11. JONNY MAY 7/10</strong> Has five tries in five championship appearances now after scoring England\u2019s first here since 2011. Was targeted by Murray\u2019s bombs but dealt with them well on the whole.</p> <p><strong>10. OWEN FARRELL 8/10 (capt) </strong>Called hotheaded in the buildup but stayed at room temperature for the most part. Kicking from hand was exceptional and exposed Henshaw\u2019s positioning.</p> <p><strong>9. BEN YOUNGS 6/10 </strong>Is not as accurate with his box-kicking as Murray but we knew that already. Kept a steady tempo though and a cool head. No surprise to see him stay on throughout.</p> <p><strong>1. MAKO VUNIPOLA 9/10 </strong>Remarkable performance. Carried time and again with real edge and made a staggering 25 tackles. Of all the illustrious Lions forwards on the pitch, he shone brightest.</p> <p><strong>2. JAMIE GEORGE 8/10 </strong>Part of an England front-five that yielded nothing and even produced a sidestep or two. Lineout came under fire in the autumn but no complaints here.</p> <p><strong>3. KYLE SINCKLER 7/10 </strong>Gave away a silly penalty in the first half but relished the confrontation. Could be heard telling the referee J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garc\u00e8s, \u201cI\u2019m just very excited tell me to shut up if you need\u201d.</p> <p><strong>4. MARO ITOJE 7/10 </strong>Clattered Earls and perhaps lucky to give away just a penalty. Summed up England\u2019s aggression though and he made a key turnover soon after. Limped off before the hour.</p> <p><strong>5. GEORGE KRUIS 7/10 </strong>Selected for his lineout nous and did not do anything wrong in that respect. Thundered into tackles -\u201d including one crucial invention on Murray.</p> <p><strong>6. MARK WILSON 8/10 </strong>A lot of his best work goes unseen but teamed up with Itoje to dump Furlong on his backside. He stepped up when Itoje departed too. England\u2019s form man produced again.</p> <p><strong>7. TOM CURRY 6/10 </strong>An inauspicious start, going off his feet at the breakdown, then hitting Earls late and earning himself a deserved yellow card. Settled thereafter.</p> <p><strong>8. BILLY VUNIPOLA 7/10 </strong>So much better than when he played here two years ago when so obviously not fit. Is not yet at the peak of his powers but he\u2019s getting a lot closer.</p> <p><strong>REPLACEMENTS</strong> <strong>Luke Cowan-Dickie</strong> (for George 76) <strong>N/A</strong>; <strong>Ellis Genge</strong> (for M Vunipola 77) <strong>N/A</strong>; <strong>Harry Williams</strong> (for Sinckler 64) <strong>6</strong>; <strong>Courtney Lawes</strong> (for Kruis 52) One penalty against, one big turnover for <strong>7</strong>; <strong>Nathan Hughes</strong> (for Itoje 55) <strong>6</strong>; <strong>George Ford </strong>(for Tuilagi 78) <strong>N/A</strong>; <strong>Chris Ashton</strong> (for Nowell 74) N<strong>/A</strong>.</p>",

DEVIN TONER 5/10 His run of consecutive wins comes to an end at 17. Is an obvious weapon at the lineout and was committed as ever but made way midway through the second half. 5. JAMES RYAN 6/10 His titanic tussle with Itoje lived up to its billing but he normally makes more headway with the ball in hand than this. 6. PETER O\u2019MAHONY 6/10 Ireland\u2019s man of the match against the All Blacks rolled up his sleeves but could not influence the breakdown, nor the lineout as he tends to. 7, JOSH VAN DER FLIER 5/10 Ireland\u2019s joint top tackler never gave up but Joe Schmidt may rue his decision to name Sean O\u2019Brien \u2013 more suited to this kind of contest \u2013 on the bench. 8. CJ STANDER 5/10 Did well to create enough doubt as to ensure Mako Vunipola\u2019s try was disallowed. Some bruising carries but could not make the same impact as at Twickenham last year. REPLACEMENTS Sean Cronin (for Best 67) 6; Dave Kilcoyne (for Healy 62) 6; Andrew Porter (for Furlong 62) 5; Quinn Roux (for Toner 57) 5; Sean O\u2019Brien (for Stander 65) 6; John Cooney (for Murray 77) 7; Joey Carbery (for Ringrose 73) N/A; Jordan Larmour (for Earls h-t) No sign of his electric footwork 5. England 15. ELLIOT DALY 7/10 Still not convincing under the high ball and was at fault in the buildup to Ireland\u2019s try. Clever grubber for his own score though. A mixed bag. 14. JACK NOWELL 8/10 Always coming off his wing, always looking for work. Got his shot at openside too, joining the scrum with Tom Curry in the sin-bin. 13. HENRY SLADE 9/10 Backed up Farrell with some shrewd kicks, excelled defensively and topped with off with a wonderful pass for his first try. Best performance for England by some distance. 12. MANU TUILAGI 7/10 First start in the competition since 2013 and begin as if to make up for lost time with two big carries shortly before May\u2019s try. Was used sparingly but can make inside-centre his home. 11. JONNY MAY 7/10 Has five tries in five championship appearances now after scoring England\u2019s first here since 2011. Was targeted by Murray\u2019s bombs but dealt with them well on the whole. 10. OWEN FARRELL 8/10 (capt) Called hotheaded in the buildup but stayed at room temperature for the most part. Kicking from hand was exceptional and exposed Henshaw\u2019s positioning. 9. BEN YOUNGS 6/10 Is not as accurate with his box-kicking as Murray but we knew that already. Kept a steady tempo though and a cool head. No surprise to see him stay on throughout. 1. MAKO VUNIPOLA 9/10 Remarkable performance. Carried time and again with real edge and made a staggering 25 tackles. Of all the illustrious Lions forwards on the pitch, he shone brightest. 2. JAMIE GEORGE 8/10 Part of an England front-five that yielded nothing and even produced a sidestep or two. Lineout came under fire in the autumn but no complaints here. 3. KYLE SINCKLER 7/10 Gave away a silly penalty in the first half but relished the confrontation. Could be heard telling the referee J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garc\u00e8s, \u201cI\u2019m just very excited tell me to shut up if you need\u201d. 4. MARO ITOJE 7/10 Clattered Earls and perhaps lucky to give away just a penalty. Summed up England\u2019s aggression though and he made a key turnover soon after. Limped off before the hour. 5. GEORGE KRUIS 7/10 Selected for his lineout nous and did not do anything wrong in that respect. Thundered into tackles -\u201d including one crucial invention on Murray. 6. MARK WILSON 8/10 A lot of his best work goes unseen but teamed up with Itoje to dump Furlong on his backside. He stepped up when Itoje departed too. England\u2019s form man produced again. 7. TOM CURRY 6/10 An inauspicious start, going off his feet at the breakdown, then hitting Earls late and earning himself a deserved yellow card. Settled thereafter. 8. BILLY VUNIPOLA 7/10 So much better than when he played here two years ago when so obviously not fit. Is not yet at the peak of his powers but he\u2019s getting a lot closer. REPLACEMENTS Luke Cowan-Dickie (for George 76) N/A; Ellis Genge (for M Vunipola 77) N/A; Harry Williams (for Sinckler 64) 6; Courtney Lawes (for Kruis 52) One penalty against, one big turnover for 7; Nathan Hughes (for Itoje 55) 6; George Ford (for Tuilagi 78) N/A; Chris Ashton (for Nowell 74) N/A.",

If ever there were a case of someone talking without knowing what he was talking about, this was it.

Ireland are a good, well-drilled side, and we tried to play England rugby, with good attacking kicks. I thought Jonny May was outstanding, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrance played really well against Wales, unlucky to lose. We\u2019re going to have a short break, and rip in on Tuesday.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c55e80de4b0c3e1fbdbcf35\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-02T18:59:11.376Z\">6.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Conor Murray</strong> gives his thoughts: \u201cWe started slow, and we gave up a couple of soft tries. Our start killed us, against a team of England\u2019s quality, you can\u2019t start that slow. The half-time chat was good, but we were a little bit flat in the second half. I can\u2019t put my finger on why\u201d</p> <p>It was strange, and it\u2019s a little odd to focus on the start when Ireland were ahead with half an hour played.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c55e74ae4b072f2ace1bc03\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-02T18:56:16.340Z\">6.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As for Ireland, that performance was neatly summed up by O\u2019Driscoll as a \u201creality check\u201d.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me on a big day for England. I\u2019ll leave you with our match report. Thanks for joining me, and enjoy your evenings. Bye! And here\u2019s Eddie Jones! \u201cWe wanted Henry and Manu to try things, and they were both outstanding. Ireland are a good, well-drilled side, and we tried to play England rugby, with good attacking kicks. I thought Jonny May was outstanding, too.\u201d \u201cFrance played really well against Wales, unlucky to lose. We\u2019re going to have a short break, and rip in on Tuesday.\u201d Conor Murray gives his thoughts: \u201cWe started slow, and we gave up a couple of soft tries. Our start killed us, against a team of England\u2019s quality, you can\u2019t start that slow. The half-time chat was good, but we were a little bit flat in the second half. I can\u2019t put my finger on why\u201d It was strange, and it\u2019s a little odd to focus on the start when Ireland were ahead with half an hour played. As for Ireland, that performance was neatly summed up by O\u2019Driscoll as a \u201creality check\u201d. England\u2019s game plan was carried out ruthlessly, but it can\u2019t have been a complete surprise. They struggled to find a Plan B, and didn\u2019t really take advantage of the occasional penalties England conceded. Their next fixture, a trip to Murrayfield, suddenly looks a little more daunting. There were so many questions around England before this match. Was it smart to spend two weeks in Portugal? How would Slade fare in such a physical battle? Was Elliot Daly a wise choice at full-back? It\u2019s extraordinary how everything came together for them. Here\u2019s Henry Slade, the man of the match for me, Clive. \u201cWe put in a big shift in the training camp the last two weeks, and it paid off today. We knew exactly how we wanted to play, we executed it perfectly. I really enjoyed it today, it\u2019s the first chance to play with Manu, and who knows, maybe we can carry on.\u201d Stick around for reaction and our match report from Dublin. First, a word from Dan Lucas\u2019s dad, Gary. \u201cI just wanted to thank you and your readers for remembering Dan before kick off. We always enjoy Six Nations time.\u201d Particularly today, I would imagine. That was the kind of England display that would have had Dan out of his seat, cheering them on. What a result that is, and what a performance by England. The Six Nations is officially wide open! Ireland chase a losing bonus point, but England defend as they have all game \u2013 with speed, intensity and fearlessness. Slade intercepts, one final kick in the midriff for Ireland, and it\u2019s all over! The Ulster scrum-half, on for his Six Nations debut, races through after England finally switch off. Ireland add a quick conversion, but it all adds up to no more than a consolation. More changes: John Cooney is on for Conor Murray, while the exemplary Mako Vunipola and Jamie George are finally stood down. Luke Cowan-Dickie and Ellis Genge come on. I\u2019m not sure even Eddie Jones saw this coming. Ireland are getting shown up in their own backyard, Farrell stretching the lead to 19 points. Good grief! Ireland are slow and sluggish in the face of the England defence, and Sexton\u2019s pass is intercepted by Slade! He gathers it in and strolls over the try line. England get a bonus point! 75 mins: Larmour grabs a high ball, and inevitably, is floored by an England tackle 0.5 seconds later... 73 mins: England fans break into \u2018Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\u2019, but are quickly whistled down by the home support. Changes for both teams \u2013 Joey Carbery replaces Ringrose, and Chris Ashton comes on for the lively Jack Nowell. 72 mins: Ireland just can\u2019t get any forward momentum. England have been relentless and show no sign of tiring, with Lawes making a big impact off the bench. This effort is from close to the halfway line, but Farrell pulls rank on the long-distance specialist, Elliot Daly. A ballsy move from Farrell, and he backs it up with a brilliant kick! 68 mins: Rory Best is replaced by Se\u00e1n Cronin, and Peter O\u2019Mahony takes over as captain. Ireland have 12 minutes or so to find a way through, but again they\u2019re forced onto the back foot, and England get the penalty in midfield! Jonny May raced down the left flank after a lovely pass from Slade and then kicked beyond the Irish defence. Slade, who was just about onside, gets there first and grounds the ball to leave the Aviva Stadium in a state of shock! Farrell misses the conversion, but England lead by nine... England break downfield, and Henry Slade may have just won this match! 65 mins: Sean O\u2019Brien comes on, replacing CJ Stander. Much has been made of Ireland\u2019s depth \u2013 now is the time to make it pay. England make a change, too \u2013 Harry Williams replaces Kyle Sinckler, who has been a spiky presence throughout. 64 mins: The move runs out of steam, and Ringrose knocks on, with Lawes risking a penalty as he comes in from the side. 63 mins: Larmour gets involved down the left, before Sexton gets the wind taken out of him by a Courtney Lawes tackle. Ireland keep pushing forward... Farrell never quite looks comfortable, and pulls his effort wide left. Changes for Ireland: Dave Kilcoyle and Andrew Porter replace Healy and Furlong. Roux came on for Devin Toner. 60 mins: Penalty! A trangression from Ireland this time, Replacement Quinn Roux leaving his hands in the ruck, and Owen Farrell will try to stretch England\u2019s lead back to seven... 59 mins: This is such a brutal contest now, both sets of players colliding again and again, the thuds echoing around the stadium. Jack Nowell is the latest to throw himself into the green wall, which doesn\u2019t move an inch. 57 mins: Ireland scrum, with Hughes and Lawes lining up in an unfamiliar lock partnership for England. The hosts retrain the ball, but Slade makes a key tackle to stop them progressing downfield. Worrying news for England \u2013 Maro Itoje has hobbled off with an ankle problem. He\u2019s replaced by Nathan Hughes, while Jack Nowell is also walking a little gingerly. There\u2019s also been a tactical change \u2013 Courtney Lawes is on for George Kruis. Jonny Sexton takes the three points on offer, and cuts the deficit to four. \u201cThis is a superb game of rugby, and an aggressive England are great value for their lead so far,\u201d writes Guy Hornsby. \u201cBut it\u2019s still our familiar Achilles heel that could be our undoing: discipline. We\u2019re giving away too many penalties. Sooner or later it\u2019ll come home to roost, I fear.\u201d The penalty count is now England 7-1 Ireland. 53 mins: Ireland\u2019s big beasts \u2013 Stander, Furlong, Ryan \u2013 all involved as the hosts try to batter their way to the line. Tuilagi leads the England resistance with a couple of big hits \u2013 but Sinckler goes in high on Ringrose, and it\u2019s another Irish penalty. 51 mins: Ireland hare downfield and Slade so nearly gives the ball up, under pressure from Stockdale! Sexton collects it, but we\u2019ll go back for an Ireland scrum. Could that be a turning point? 50 mins: England move within 10 metres, Tuilagi going toe-to-toe with Aki in an effort to find a gap. Ireland have numbers back, and Ringrose absolutely levels Farrell with a tackle that pops the ball out! 48 mins: More sterling work from Jonny May under the high ball, earning England a scrum. England have been dominant in 30 tackles, compared to Ireland\u2019s seven. That\u2019s quite the stat. 46 mins: Ireland are feeling the heat, and O\u2019Mahony loses his rag with Sinckler, grabbing him by the collar and labelling him a \u201cstupid cee\u201d, or similar. The referee has a word with them both, and we\u2019ll restart with an Ireland lineout. 45 mins: Ireland haven\u2019t really made a crack in this white wall since Healy\u2019s try. They\u2019re inching forward here, and get an advantage - but Sexton kicks across field, and England get it back. A kick through is reeled in by Henshaw, again under intense pressure from the England backs. 44 mins: A little sloppy from England \u2013 they fail to collect a lineout in midfield, before Farrell\u2019s kick for the corner flies into touch. 43 mins: Larmour for Earls is a tactical change, so I\u2019m told. 42 mins: An exchange of kicks before Youngs scoops up Murray\u2019s pass and England press forward. Ireland have a lineout near their own line, and win it, allowing Murray to heave it clear. A half-time change for Ireland: Keith Earls, who took a couple of hammerings in the first half, is replaced by Jordan Larmour. The players are heading back out. \u201cForty minutes is a long time in Test rugby,\u201d warns Brian O\u2019Driscoll, who looks like he\u2019s itching to throw on the old green jersey and get there. England came flying out of the traps, Jonny May scoring a try inside two minutes. Ireland kept their heads to rally and take the lead, but Eddie Jones\u2019 men came back stronger, scoring through Elliot Daly and so nearly getting a third through Mako Vunipola. The visitors have mixed attacking elegance with defensive aggression, and are good value for their half-time lead. There\u2019s a long way to go, though \u2013 can they keep the mistakes to a minimum in the face of an Irish fightback? Half-time reading Take your pick from these: No try, but a penalty for England from that previous advantage \u2013 and Farrell collects the three points. After a thrilling, ferocious first half, they lead by seven! The TMO, Glenn Newman, has the hottest collar in Dublin just now. Garces is leaning towards NO TRY, but wants confirmation from the Kiwi, frantically scrolling through replays... TRY? Advantage for England, but they keep plugging for the line \u2013 and Mako Vunipola dives beneath CJ Stander to ground the ball! Garces is going to the TMO, to check for a double movement... 38 mins: Mako Vunipola breaks free of the scrum and offloads to Nowell, who is somehow held up on the line by a swarm of green shirts. England retain the ball, and can sense a third try... 38 mins: A pivotal moment perhaps? Rory Best can\u2019t deliver a straight lineout 5m out, and England have a scrum with two minutes of the half to go. 36 mins: Murray can\u2019t find touch and Billy Vunipola comes barrelling down the field. England sweep forward, Jamie George leading the next phase \u2013 but eventually, Jack Nowell is forced into touch on the right flank. 35 mins: Murray collects a kick, and is unceremoniously bundled into touch by May. England very much up for this, defending with controlled aggression. From the England lineout, a deft chip kick through has Henshaw in trouble, but he does well to collect under pressure from May. 33 mins: Ireland travel the width of the pitch in search of a gap in the England defence. Eddie Jones\u2019 side are holding firm as the contest gets physical. You can hear the thuds of the tackles, the forwards gasping for air. 32 mins: Slade has looked very tidy indeed on his first Six Nations start. There\u2019s a nice balance in the middle, with Slade alongside Tualagi and Farrell ahead. Stockdale is there to collect, but under ferocious pressure from Nowell, he spills the ball \u2013 and Daly, chasing down his own kick, touches down ahead of Furlong! Farrell converts, and England are back in front. 29 mins: England claim the lineout, and Daly sends a diagonal kick through for Nowell to chase... 28 mins: Henry Slade gets the ball down despite the efforts of Tadhg Furlong, and England stay in Irish territory. Farrell and Slade try to put pressure on Henshaw, and the latter effort works, forcing the full-back to find touch with his left boot. 26 mins: Plenty of aggression from both teams, and the decision to go for the try pays off for Ireland, who edge in front, the ship very much steadied. England hold Ireland off, pinned back on their own line, and repel Conor Murray\u2019s dive for the line. It can\u2019t last, though, and Cian Healy eventually forces his way over. Sexton with the conversion, out wide to the right \u2013 and he nails it. 23 mins: A bold move from Ireland, turning down the three points to go for the line against 15 men. They win the lineout, straighten up the maul and pile towards the line... 22 mins: Ireland have less than a minute to make their man advantage count. Stockdale gets the crowd on their feet with a dancing run down the right, and Sexton\u2019s kick through catches England offside. Penalty, and the fly-half kicks for the corner as Curry comes back on the field. 20 mins: ...Ireland go again, Garry Ringrose leading the charge \u2013 and May lets a grubber kick through his grasp! Ireland get held up just short of the line, though \u2013 and England turn it over. 19 mins: England spent much of their time in Portugal practising their high-ball catching, and it\u2019s paying off so far \u2013 they deal with another Murray box kick comfortably... 18 mins: Earls gets another clattering, Itoje going in hard on the Ireland wing. Penalty for the hosts in their own half, with both captains mithering to the referee. Owen Farrell felt that Conor Murray was blocking Jonny May. Already plenty of needle in this one. 17 mins: After Stockdale runs out of room down the left, a loose pass from Bundee Aki is almost reeled in by Van der Flier, but England turn it over. 15 mins: Jack Nowell is drafted into the pack and England retain the ball, Youngs racing round the scrum and kicking downfield \u2013 but Henshaw, another unexpected full-back selection, claims comfortably. 14 mins: So after that rush of blood from Curry, England will be very happy to hold their lead as he stews in the sin bin. The visitors get an advantage and hold onto the ball, not wanting to give it straight back to the hosts. They\u2019ll take a scrum instead. 13 mins: The boos ring around the Aviva Stadium as Tom Curry goes in hard on Keith Earls. Jerome Garces tells him his timing was all wrong, and he\u2019s off to the sin bin. It\u2019s a bad one, high and late from the Sale man. 12 mins: Terrific kick from Murray, swivelling to deliver a high ball that swerves in the air and has Daly worried. He opts to leave it, and wisely so. Watching Wales\u2019 glorious comeback last night (or, \u2018lucky exploitation of France\u2019s implosion\u2019, depending on which side of Offa\u2019s Dyke you live on...), it still felt wrong not sending a Manics reference (and a joke about Dirty Dylan Hartley) to Dan Lucas,\u201d writes Matt Dony. \u201cThe Six Nations is a fantastic tournament, but his writing was often the icing on the coverage cake. Incidentally, I think England might squeak it today, winning by one score. I can see them being incredibly fired up and focused, with some massive points to prove.\u201d ...which he does, with minimal fuss. Ireland cut the gap. 9 mins: Penalty advantage for Ireland, Sinckler not moving away. Sexton sends a high ball down May\u2019s throat, but the wing deals with it comfortably. Sexton will now kick for the three points... 8 mins: O\u2019Mahony collects the lineout \u2013 that\u2019s a set piece where Ireland were ridiculously dominant last year. Murray tries a diagonal chip and charge but May collects and tries to hoof it in behind \u2013 it lands just out of play though, and Ireland will stay in England territory. 6 mins: Ireland aren\u2019t panicking, keeping their heads at the breakdown and getting a penalty to relieve a bit of pressure. Murray finds touch, and the hosts have a lineout. 5 mins: Daly charges into midfield to collect a Sexton kick. No sign of nerves from the relocated full-back, there. 4 mins: That\u2019s England\u2019s first try in Dublin since 2011. How will Ireland respond to that blistering start? Farrell takes a risk, swinging the ball into the gap left by Earls, and it\u2019s collected by Daly, who offloads to May \u2013 who slides in at the corner! Farrell converts. What a start for England! 1 min: Tuilagi makes an early impact as England start on the offensive, Jack Nowell also testing the wall of green - and now Farrell switches it to the left flank... Owen Farrell kicks off to a mighty roar. Ireland collect, and Connor Murray clears it away. Anthem time! \u2018God Save the Queen\u2019 doesn\u2019t receive the boos it got in the North-South football friendly back in November. That\u2019s followed by the Republic\u2019s national anthem \u2013 but it\u2019s \u201cIreland\u2019s Call\u201d that stirs the crowd, and leaves a couple of home players with something in their eye. \u201c19-18 \u2013 to one side or the other,\u201d says Dean Hawkes, splinters embedded in his posterior. Some pre-game stats from Simon Gleave and Gracenote: Ireland have not lost a Six Nations match in Dublin since Joe Schmidt took charge of the team in the summer of 2013. Wales are the only team to come away from Dublin with anything in the Six Nations since then, drawing 16-16 on the opening weekend of the 2016 Championship. Ireland have the most settled team of the six countries playing this weekend with 12 of the starting XV against England last year also starting today. Seventeen of today\u2019s 23 were part of the 23 in last year\u2019s Grand Slam winning match. Before 2014, Ireland have won two Six Nations titles in 30 years. They\u2019ve won three of the last five, including a grand slam last year, and are ranked No 2 in the world. On the club scene, three Irish provinces are in the Heineken Cup quarter-finals \u2013 a tournament Irish teams have won seven times. How did they get here? Donald McRae can tell you, with his terrific long read: Anyone care to make a prediction? Get in touch... Here\u2019s a song from Dan\u2019s favourite band \u2013 and something to settle the nerves with kick-off approaching: I couldn\u2019t agree more, John. These Six Nations Saturdays were where Dan absolutely came into his own. He\u2019s still much missed at Guardian Towers, and by many of you out there, I\u2019m sure. Scotland have opened with a win, and it was a very impressive one with an hour gone. Then Italy, having barely left their half, managed to score three tries. Still, a win is a win, right? While I report on the last knockings of Scotland v Italy, feast your eyes on our previews: Ireland: 15 Robbie Henshaw, 14 Keith Earls, 13 Garry Ringrose, 12 Bundee Aki, 11 Jacob Stockdale, 10 Johnny Sexton, 9 Conor Murray; 1 Cian Healy, 2 Rory Best (c), 3 Tadhg Furlong; 4 Devin Toner, 5 James Ryan, 6 Peter O\u2019Mahony, 7 Josh van der Flier, 8 CJ Stander. Replacements: 16 Se\u00e1n Cronin, 17 Dave Kilcoyne, 18 Andrew Porter, 19 Quinn Roux, 20 Se\u00e1n O\u2019Brien, 21 John Cooney, 22 Joey Carbery, 23 Jordan Larmour. England: 15 Elliot Daly, 14 Jonny May, 13 Henry Slade, 12 Manu Tuilagi, 11 Jack Nowell, 10 Owen Farrell (c), 9 Ben Youngs; 1 Mako Vunipola, 2 Jamie George, 3 Kyle Sinckler; 4 Maro Itoje, 5 George Kruis; 6 Mark Wilson, 7 Tom Curry, 8 Billy Vunipola. Replacements: 16 Luke Cowan-Dickie, 17 Ellis Genge, 18 Harry Williams, 19 Courtney Lawes, 20 Nathan Hughes, 21 Dan Robson, 22 George Ford, 23 Chris Ashton. Good afternoon. To paraphrase one of the great Anglo-Irish sporting men, you\u2019ve obviously heard there\u2019s a rugby match on. This Six Nations has been billed as a battle for northern hemisphere supremacy with the World Cup looming, but the most significant stramash of all may be here, on the opening weekend. Ireland usurped England as the north\u2019s true powerhouse with last year\u2019s grand slam, won without mercy at a shell-shocked Twickenham. Victory over the All Blacks in November has put them on top of the world, but Eddie Jones will be desperate to bring Joe Schmidt back down to earth today. The hosts are favourites, but England have the weapons to exploit any gaps in the Irish armour, with Manu Tuilagi returning to a beefed-up back field primed for a physical battle. You can count on Ireland to be relentless, forensically focused and ready to pounce on any lapse in English concentration. Throw in a couple of surprise full-back selections, a raucous home crowd and a dash of political intrigue, and we have ourselves a potential classic. It\u2019s the Red Rose v the Green Machine, all kicking off at 4.45pm.",

This time it was Ireland who were forced to kick hurriedly away rather than play from well behind the gainline and England who were dominant in the air and on the floor: the home side did not force one turnover at a ruck and saw little return from their box-kicks.

At the point when the world\u2019s form team reached out to grasp victory, it was wrenched away from them by a team that seemed to be guided by fate. Jones had talked in the buildup about using Nowell as a ninth forward but England\u2019s head coach already has one. Mako Vunipola does the work of two, a prop who is an extra flanker. He made 25 tackles, embodying his side\u2019s defiance.</p> <p>Jones had started with five Saracens in his pack and England bore the hallmark of their club champions: focused and uncomplicated. With another Saracen, Farrell, in control behind, England used their physical presence as a means to an end rather than an end itself. For once, to see England play was to see them train and Ireland, whose half-backs Conor Murray and Sexton lacked match sharpness on an evening when they were unable to influence the pace of the game, struggled to adapt.</p> <p>Ireland are a team that trade in certainties. The last time they won after trailing at half-time was in Argentina in the summer of 2014. A well-drilled, programmed side are at their most vulnerable playing catch-up, when scripts have to be hastily rewritten. The game may have looked there for them after Sexton\u2019s second penalty but it faded like a mirage. After Farrell had missed a long-range penalty, England attacked from deep, May kicking to the line for Slade to outpace the defence. The try was reviewed \u2013 not, as Ireland wanted, for a suspected forward pass in the buildup, which J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garc\u00e8s ruined as too historic to bother him, but for offside. Slade was level and the try stood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Farrell\u2019s third penalty 10 minutes from time ensured victory and Slade garnished it with a bonus point when he intercepted Sexton\u2019s forced pass as an Ireland team so used to constricting opponents into mistakes was itself suffocated. John Cooney\u2019s late try was little consolation for the champions, who are in Scotland on Saturday, the day before England face France. But after an opening round when a few images were shattered, nothing will be assumed.</p>",

It is in such moments that reputations are made. At the point when the world\u2019s form team reached out to grasp victory, it was wrenched away from them by a team that seemed to be guided by fate. Jones had talked in the buildup about using Nowell as a ninth forward but England\u2019s head coach already has one. Mako Vunipola does the work of two, a prop who is an extra flanker. He made 25 tackles, embodying his side\u2019s defiance. Jones had started with five Saracens in his pack and England bore the hallmark of their club champions: focused and uncomplicated. With another Saracen, Farrell, in control behind, England used their physical presence as a means to an end rather than an end itself. For once, to see England play was to see them train and Ireland, whose half-backs Conor Murray and Sexton lacked match sharpness on an evening when they were unable to influence the pace of the game, struggled to adapt. Ireland are a team that trade in certainties. The last time they won after trailing at half-time was in Argentina in the summer of 2014. A well-drilled, programmed side are at their most vulnerable playing catch-up, when scripts have to be hastily rewritten. The game may have looked there for them after Sexton\u2019s second penalty but it faded like a mirage. After Farrell had missed a long-range penalty, England attacked from deep, May kicking to the line for Slade to outpace the defence. The try was reviewed \u2013 not, as Ireland wanted, for a suspected forward pass in the buildup, which J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garc\u00e8s ruined as too historic to bother him, but for offside. Slade was level and the try stood. Farrell\u2019s third penalty 10 minutes from time ensured victory and Slade garnished it with a bonus point when he intercepted Sexton\u2019s forced pass as an Ireland team so used to constricting opponents into mistakes was itself suffocated. John Cooney\u2019s late try was little consolation for the champions, who are in Scotland on Saturday, the day before England face France. But after an opening round when a few images were shattered, nothing will be assumed.",

The memo outlined some of Peretti\u2019s frustrations after that year\u2019s US presidential election had revealed how much shoddy and misleading content was circulating online. His own news site had revealed some of the biggest stories in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/29/facebook-accused-by-brussels-over-patchy-attitude-to-fake-news-nick-clegg\" title=\"\">\u201cfake news\u201d scandal that engulfed Facebook</a>. But Peretti\u2019s remedy was not regulation or chastisement of Facebook, but a concern that the old guard of so-called \u201clegacy media\u201d were also to blame.</p> <p>\u201cMedia companies have been much too slow to shift to digital,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey\u2019ve clung to print and broadcast, even when it was clear audiences are moving elsewhere. This means the budgets for quality journalism are focused on the wrong places, creating a void that is filled by the cheapest possible content, often from questionable sources.\u201d</p> <p>In New York City, in January 2019, it is brutally cold. Winter has arrived with savage consequences for digital publishers, including BuzzFeed. In the space of two weeks, about 2,100 jobs have been lost across the media, with many disappearing from purely digital publishers. BuzzFeed\u2019s layoffs amounted to 15% of its total staff, a loss of around 220 jobs across all departments, including in its widely admired New York newsroom. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/feb/01/vice-to-axe-250-staff-in-latest-round-of-digital-media-job-losses\" title=\"\">On Friday, Vice</a>, another media company once associated with fast growth, said it would lay off 10% of its workforce, while last month, the phone company Verizon, which owns Huffington Post and Yahoo, cut 800 workers in its media division. In the UK, the Pool, a website aimed at women launched in 2015 by radio presenter Lauren Laverne and magazine editor Sam Baker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/31/online-womens-magazine-the-pool-enters-administration\" title=\"\">went into liquidation</a>, with 24 journalists facing redundancy.</p> <p>Many of these layoffs played out in real time on Twitter as journalists reported on the fumbling and often ineptly cruel ways in which they were let go. Reporters at Vice knew of the layoffs and sometimes had their email accounts closed before being told by the company they were among the casualties.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e38a248d31a6742138309f9f6b2faf91c601b68b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e38a248d31a6742138309f9f6b2faf91c601b68b/0_142_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ariann Huffington, founder of Huffington Post, whose parent company Verizon last month announced 800 job cuts in its media division.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ariann Huffington, founder of Huffington Post, whose parent company Verizon last month announced 800 job cuts in its media division.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Fortune</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Job losses in the media are not unusual. In newspapers, particularly in the local and regional press in the US, the past decade has been catastrophic. <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/07/30/newsroom-employment-dropped-nearly-a-quarter-in-less-than-10-years-with-greatest-decline-at-newspapers/\" title=\"\">Between 2008 and 2017, the number of newsroom jobs in US newspapers</a> dropped by 45%, to 39,000, and all US newsroom jobs, including TV and radio, declined by 23% overall. Among the layoffs so far in 2019, newspaper companies McClatchy and Gannett have announced early retirement and redundancy rounds. But the polar vortex that has engulfed digital publishing, though relatively small by comparison, has left the industry, and journalists in particular, reeling. The long slow decline of newspapers has been well documented, as advertisers and readers have increasingly shifted their attention to digital platforms. But for the companies that were lauded for having understood the social web faster than legacy media to falter sends a signal too dire for many media companies to contemplate. Many of us are concluding that the commercial internet makes profitable journalism exponentially harder, and in many cases impossible.</p> <p>Media consumption habits on the mobile social web have changed radically. Around 68% of adults in the US get at least <a href=\"http://www.journalism.org/2018/09/10/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2018/\" title=\"\">some of their news from social media platforms</a>, and the majority of those cite Facebook as the primary source. Facebook\u2019s valuation is now above $470bn (\u00a3360bn). Google\u2019s market value has risen from $200bn in 2012 to almost $800bn. Google and Facebook between them dominate the digital advertising market.

      "bodyText": "In December 2016, Jonah Peretti, the charismatic founder of the digital news and entertainment company BuzzFeed, penned his annual memo to his 1,400 staff. The memo outlined some of Peretti\u2019s frustrations after that year\u2019s US presidential election had revealed how much shoddy and misleading content was circulating online. His own news site had revealed some of the biggest stories in the \u201cfake news\u201d scandal that engulfed Facebook. But Peretti\u2019s remedy was not regulation or chastisement of Facebook, but a concern that the old guard of so-called \u201clegacy media\u201d were also to blame. \u201cMedia companies have been much too slow to shift to digital,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey\u2019ve clung to print and broadcast, even when it was clear audiences are moving elsewhere. This means the budgets for quality journalism are focused on the wrong places, creating a void that is filled by the cheapest possible content, often from questionable sources.\u201d In New York City, in January 2019, it is brutally cold. Winter has arrived with savage consequences for digital publishers, including BuzzFeed. In the space of two weeks, about 2,100 jobs have been lost across the media, with many disappearing from purely digital publishers. BuzzFeed\u2019s layoffs amounted to 15% of its total staff, a loss of around 220 jobs across all departments, including in its widely admired New York newsroom. On Friday, Vice, another media company once associated with fast growth, said it would lay off 10% of its workforce, while last month, the phone company Verizon, which owns Huffington Post and Yahoo, cut 800 workers in its media division. In the UK, the Pool, a website aimed at women launched in 2015 by radio presenter Lauren Laverne and magazine editor Sam Baker, went into liquidation, with 24 journalists facing redundancy. Many of these layoffs played out in real time on Twitter as journalists reported on the fumbling and often ineptly cruel ways in which they were let go. Reporters at Vice knew of the layoffs and sometimes had their email accounts closed before being told by the company they were among the casualties. Job losses in the media are not unusual. In newspapers, particularly in the local and regional press in the US, the past decade has been catastrophic. Between 2008 and 2017, the number of newsroom jobs in US newspapers dropped by 45%, to 39,000, and all US newsroom jobs, including TV and radio, declined by 23% overall. Among the layoffs so far in 2019, newspaper companies McClatchy and Gannett have announced early retirement and redundancy rounds. But the polar vortex that has engulfed digital publishing, though relatively small by comparison, has left the industry, and journalists in particular, reeling. The long slow decline of newspapers has been well documented, as advertisers and readers have increasingly shifted their attention to digital platforms. But for the companies that were lauded for having understood the social web faster than legacy media to falter sends a signal too dire for many media companies to contemplate. Many of us are concluding that the commercial internet makes profitable journalism exponentially harder, and in many cases impossible. Media consumption habits on the mobile social web have changed radically. Around 68% of adults in the US get at least some of their news from social media platforms, and the majority of those cite Facebook as the primary source. Facebook\u2019s valuation is now above $470bn (\u00a3360bn). Google\u2019s market value has risen from $200bn in 2012 to almost $800bn. Google and Facebook between them dominate the digital advertising market. In the same week that BuzzFeed announced its job losses, Facebook reported record revenues of almost $17bn for the last quarter of 2018. Despite a year of horrible publicity, from being blamed for contributing to genocide in Myanmar to a series of scandals around data and privacy, Facebook\u2019s business appears as strong as ever. The primary mistake most digital publishers made was to imagine that platform companies, and particularly Google and Facebook, had any serious interest in helping them sustain their businesses. The amount of data large platform companies collect and control enables them to offer far more efficient advertising than any publisher, and the business of making online content profitable is rigged against anyone who wants to run even a sparsely resourced newsroom with experienced reporters. Peretti\u2019s memo to staff after the layoffs was instructive about what would be needed to be sustainable: \u201cWe can build a profitable media businesses on top of Facebook and YouTube,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut only when the content we make is high quality, with massive scale and relatively low production costs.\u201d Whatever this content might be it is unlikely to be in-depth investigative reporting, which is neither cheap to produce nor generally something that attracts \u201cmassive scale\u201d. If BuzzFeed, Vice and other digital publishers who suffered despite a booming advertising market cannot make the social web work for them, it is likely that those who do will not be reliant on advertising. It is also likely that this year\u2019s job losses are merely the beginning of a new publishing depression. In regions such as the US, which has relied almost entirely on a free market to hold the powerful to account for the past 70 years, the lack of well-funded and abundant civic or public media is particularly sharply felt. In what seems like an attempt to apply a sticking plaster to an amputation, both Facebook and Google are now funding efforts at the local level to increase reporters and newsroom resources through schemes such as Report for America. Between them, the digital duopoly is spending $600m over the next three years on supporting journalism. But involvement of big tech in serious reporting is both ethically awkward and, so far, largely ineffective. It was not the deliberate intention of Google, Facebook, Twitter and others to drain the advertising pool that supported journalism, but they did not particularly care whether publishers survived or failed. BuzzFeed had an almost symbiotic relationship with Facebook, collaborating on projects and helping it promote its tools to other publishers. However, reports suggest that after adjusting its algorithm to demote news, Facebook\u2019s traffic to BuzzFeed and other publishers\u2019 sites has dropped dramatically. Plenty of people tout advice for what might work for news outlets, be it podcasts or newsletters, or having a very small niche audience, or the increasingly popular membership models or new types of subscription. And there are real examples of where different models are working, notably in non-profit and niche sectors. The New York Times and Washington Post (which operates under the protection of the billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos) are large, well funded and have both been growing their newsrooms when others are shrinking. Both have seen success with charging readers subscriptions, but there are very few organisations that can replicate either their brands or their resources. The future of journalism will generally be smaller and more challenging in the short term and remains uncertain in the long term. However, the problem now is so clear that even the most advanced digital thinkers can see it: a digital free market for journalism doesn\u2019t work.

They need a general election now.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn paid tribute to the volunteers and charities that have stepped in to support people who are suffering, but said people should not have to rely on the voluntary sector. \u201cIt is a disgrace that people are living on the streets and forced to rely on food banks in one of the richest countries in the world,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u201cThe SNP government has not just passed on Tory austerity, it has quadrupled it for local councils. And this week\u2019s budget will mean another \u00a3230m in cuts that will hit local services the people of Scotland rely on.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a clear choice between more austerity or a Labour government that will put an end to austerity and build a country for the many, not the few.\u201d</p> <p>A third of children in south-west Glasgow live in poverty, according to statistics highlighted by Labour from the End Child Poverty coalition. Life expectancy in the area is almost 74 years for men and 79 for women, markedly lower than the Scottish national averages of 77 and 81.</p> <p>Figures published in December showed that life expectancy had fallen in Scotland for the first time in 35 years, and across the UK life expectancy growth since 2011 has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/07/increase-in-uk-life-spans-stalling-at-one-of-fastest-rates-among-20-leading-economies\"> slumped faster</a> than in a number of other leading economies.</p> <p>Joined by Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, and Matt Kerr, the Labour candidate for Glasgow South West, Corbyn said food bank use in Scotland was at record levels. Statistics showed it had increased by 17% in just 12 months, higher than the UK\u2019s 13% rise during the same period.</p> <p>Labour was leading the Conservatives by one percentage point in the latest Survation poll, with others putting the two parties level pegging. Meanwhile, YouGov has consistently polled Labour as trailing the Tories.</p> <p>Recent attempts to persuade a majority of MPs to back a vote of no confidence in Theresa May have failed, but the Fixed Term Parliament Act allows for early elections if two-thirds of MPs vote in favour.</p> <p>A Scottish Conservative spokesman said: \u201cAt the last general election, it was the Scottish Conservatives, not Labour, that were making huge gains across the country and winning 12 extra seats.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has called for a snap general election during a meeting of anti-poverty charities in Glasgow. He said people who have experienced \u201cthe brunt of nine years of austerity\u201d must be allowed a new vote. The Labour leader met with voluntary organisations and charities working to tackle poverty in south-west Glasgow on Saturday, where he criticised \u201cTory cuts\u201d while pointing to double-digit yearly increases in food bank use and falling life expectancy in Scotland\u2019s most populated city. \u201cPeople are suffering under austerity as a direct result of Tory cuts in Westminster passed down by the SNP in Holyrood,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people who are bearing the brunt of nine years of austerity cannot wait years for a general election. They need a general election now.\u201d Corbyn paid tribute to the volunteers and charities that have stepped in to support people who are suffering, but said people should not have to rely on the voluntary sector. \u201cIt is a disgrace that people are living on the streets and forced to rely on food banks in one of the richest countries in the world,\u201d he added. \u201cThe SNP government has not just passed on Tory austerity, it has quadrupled it for local councils. And this week\u2019s budget will mean another \u00a3230m in cuts that will hit local services the people of Scotland rely on. \u201cThere is a clear choice between more austerity or a Labour government that will put an end to austerity and build a country for the many, not the few.\u201d A third of children in south-west Glasgow live in poverty, according to statistics highlighted by Labour from the End Child Poverty coalition. Life expectancy in the area is almost 74 years for men and 79 for women, markedly lower than the Scottish national averages of 77 and 81. Figures published in December showed that life expectancy had fallen in Scotland for the first time in 35 years, and across the UK life expectancy growth since 2011 has slumped faster than in a number of other leading economies. Joined by Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, and Matt Kerr, the Labour candidate for Glasgow South West, Corbyn said food bank use in Scotland was at record levels. Statistics showed it had increased by 17% in just 12 months, higher than the UK\u2019s 13% rise during the same period. Labour was leading the Conservatives by one percentage point in the latest Survation poll, with others putting the two parties level pegging. Meanwhile, YouGov has consistently polled Labour as trailing the Tories. Recent attempts to persuade a majority of MPs to back a vote of no confidence in Theresa May have failed, but the Fixed Term Parliament Act allows for early elections if two-thirds of MPs vote in favour. A Scottish Conservative spokesman said: \u201cAt the last general election, it was the Scottish Conservatives, not Labour, that were making huge gains across the country and winning 12 extra seats. Voters know that Labour are too weak to stand up to the SNP and that the only party that can take on the nationalists and win is the Scottish Conservatives.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Championship Substitute Britt Assombalonga\u2019s double gave Middlesbrough manager Tony Pulis a dramatic victory over former club West Brom. Boro took an early lead with a George Saville strike before Jay Rodriguez levelled matters with close-range toe poke just before half-time. The Baggies took the lead through a deflected strike from Dwight Gayle before Assombalonga\u2019s low finish grabbed an equaliser before Chris Brunt\u2019s mistake gifted the Congolese striker the 83rd minute winner. Steve Bruce took charge of Sheffield Wednesday for the first time as his new team travelled to bottom club Ipswich, and they struggled to find a goal despite piling on heavy pressure. It took Lucas Jo\u00e3o, in the final minute of normal time, to find the winner. Hull took a 44th minute lead against Stoke when Jarrod Bowen chipped in a free-kick, and that advantage was preserved when goalkeeper David Marshall saved a penalty from Sam Vokes, making his debut after his deadline day move from Burnley. Stoke have scored just two of seven penalties this season and when Kamil Grosicki scored Hull\u2019s second, Nathan Jones\u2019 team were condemned to defeat. Third-placed Sheffield United kept on the tails of leaders Leeds and Norwich in the hunt for automatic promotion when taking three points off strugglers Bolton. David McGoldrick tapped in an assist from Billy Sharp, the club captain and division\u2019s joint-top scorer then grabbed a second in the 73rd minute. Bristol City took advantage of Derby\u2019s Friday night draw with Preston by climbing into sixth with a 2-0 defeat of Swansea, with Andreas Weimann and Calum O\u2019Dowda scoring the goals. Following the match it was announced that Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins had resigned after 17 years at the club. Josh Windass opened the scoring for Wigan against QPR, before Leon Clarke, making a second debut for the Latics after this week\u2019s loan move from Sheffield United, got a second. Bright Osayi-Samuel snatched a consolation for Rangers. Jota\u2019s crisp strike set Birmingham on their way to a 2-0 victory in Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s third game in charge of Nottingham Forest; the former Ireland manager has lost two of three since taking the reins at the City Ground. Defeat was confirmed when Yohan Benalouan was sent off for handling on the line and Che Adams scored from the penalty spot. Brentford ran riot in beating Blackburn 5-2, who had been leading 2-0 after Danny Graham\u2019s seventh minute goal followed up Bradley Dack\u2019s strike. Sa\u00efd Benrahma\u2019s 13th minute goal pulled Brentford back but they were not level until Ollie Watkins scored in the 58th minute. Watkins\u2019 second put the Bees in the lead before Neal Maupay and Sergi Canos completed the rout. Both Reading v Aston Villa and Millwall v Rotherham were played out as disappointing goalless draws. League One James Collins continued his rich scoring form in 2019 when netting leaders Luton\u2019s first and third goals at Shrewsbury; Matty Pearson got the second. Barnsley\u2019s rush for automatic promotion continued with a 2-0 defeat of Scunthorpe, with Alex Mowatt getting their first goal and Cameron McGeehan the second. Ched Evans scored the only goal of the game as Fleetwood defeated Charlton. Accrington\u2019s Lancashire derby against Blackpool fell victim to the weather. League Two Bottom club Notts County got off to a great start against leaders Lincoln when veteran striker Jon Stead slotted a second-minute penalty but Bruno Andrade levelled on half-time. Lincoln might have stolen a win but striker John Akinde missed a late penalty. Second-placed Mansfield took on second-bottom Macclesfield, and Jorge Grant, on loan from Nottingham Forest, put the Stags into an eighth-minute lead. Callum Evans equalised in first-half injury time for the Silkmen but was unfortunate enough to direct the ball into his own net for Mansfield\u2019s second. Tyler Walker\u2019s 89th minute goal sealed the points and to the gap on Lincoln. Northampton\u2019s 11-game unbeaten run came to an end with a punishing 4-0 home defeat to Colchester. Paul Tisdale returned to Exeter, the club he managed for 12 years, with MK Dons and ended up on the end of a 3-1 defeat, with Nicky Law scoring two goals. Four matches were lost to wintry weather in the lowest tier, with each of Cheltenham v Cambridge, Oldham v Morecambe, Port Vale v Tranmere and Swindon v Forest Green postponed.",

      "body": "<p>James Lasdun is a novelist, short-story writer, poet and film-maker. With Jonathan Nossiter, he co-wrote the films <em>Sunday</em> (1997) \u2013 which won the grand jury prize and the Waldo Salt screenwriting award at Sundance \u2013 and <em>Signs </em><em>&amp; Wonders</em> (2000), starring Charlotte Rampling and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd. He was born in the UK \u2013 the son of architect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/nov/29/architecture.art\" title=\"\">Sir Denys Lasdun</a> \u2013 but now lives and works in the US. He spoke to me from his home in the hills of upstate New York. His latest book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/victory-9781787331174.html\" title=\"\"><em>Victory</em></a>, comprises two novellas \u2013 <em>Feathered </em><em>Glory</em> and <em>Afternoon of a Faun</em>, both darkly humorous and compelling portraits of men wrestling with guilt and desire.</p> <p><strong><em>Afternoon of a Faun</em> is about a historical act coming to light years later. It feels very much a novel of our times. Was this intentional?</strong><br>I didn\u2019t write it as a #MeToo novel. I started it at the very beginning of 2017. Trump had been elected, then I was nearly finishing it as the Harvey Weinstein story broke and #MeToo started. I was totally caught off my guard. I didn\u2019t really see that coming and it was a little complicated for me. I could see in an opportunistic way that it connected very strongly\u2026 but it was sort of an accident.</p> <p><strong>It called to mind another great</strong><strong> short novel \u2013 J</strong><strong>M</strong><strong> Coetzee\u2019s </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/10/100-best-novels-disgrace-jm-coetzee-intensely-human\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Disgrace</em></strong></a><strong>.</strong><br>I\u2019ve read <em>Disgrace</em>; it\u2019s an amazing novel. The story of sexual misconduct, of allegations \u2013 it\u2019s become a trope. So I\u2019m sure it had an effect on me, but so did many other novels, real-life stories, plays. Writers are really drawn to that subject for obvious reasons. It\u2019s of great interest to me and this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve written about it. I wrote about it in my first novel, <em>The Horned Man</em>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wanted to get a lot of the different aspects of male behaviour down, not just the toxic elements</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>The first story, <em>Feathered Glory</em>, is, among</strong><strong> other things, about an injured bird.</strong><br>We took in a swan at one point. My wife was working with a wildlife rehabilitator. I can\u2019t remember exactly how it came about, but I had a swan in a cage in the room that I was writing in. It was with us not a very long time, but it was a very powerful presence and I knew that one way or another I wanted to write about it.</p> <p><strong>These are stories about toxic masculinity, but they\u2019re also about male friendship.</strong><br>I think male friendships are quite fascinating. I have very longstanding friendships with other men. Especially after you get married, you tend to conduct most of your close relationships outside of marriage with guys. I didn\u2019t want to write a satire of bad behaviours \u2013 I wanted it to get a lot of the different aspects of male behaviour down, not just the toxic elements. But that\u2019s a part of it, it\u2019s what drives the story. Different things seem toxic at different times, too; they\u2019re both stories that go over long-ish time periods in which social values shift and I wanted to capture a little bit of that.</p> <p><strong>In the </strong><strong>201</strong><strong>3</strong><strong> memoir, </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/16/give-me-everything-stalked-lasdun-review\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Give Me Everything You Have</em></strong></a><strong><em>,</em> you wrote \u2013 in a manner </strong><strong>that stirred some controversy \u2013 about your experience of being stalked by a former student. I wondered how much that experience fed into these stories?</strong><br>I\u2019d been writing versions of that kind of narrative, of devastating interruption of a relatively stable life, before my whole stalker thing. In a strange way that episode fell into a pattern of things that was already part of my imaging. There were all these sorts of very bizarre resemblances between what happened with my stalker and what I\u2019d written in <em>The Horned Man</em> several years before. So it wasn\u2019t like this introduced me to a whole new emotional spectrum, but it did give me a horrific amount of psychic material to work with. It certainly made writing this kind of a story possible, perhaps inevitable.</p> <p><strong>You write poems, prose, short stories, screen</strong><strong>plays. In which medium do you feel most comfortable?</strong><br>I just think of myself as a writer. At various different times different forms have appealed more or less. I haven\u2019t been reading or writing poetry for a while, I\u2019m not sure why. I used to be able to do both at once and around about the time we had kids, something had to give. I don\u2019t feel terribly engaged with poetry at the moment. I hope that changes.</p> <p><strong>Did the novella as a form particularly appeal to you? There seems to be something of a vogue at the moment for these shorter books.</strong><br>I do like short novels or novellas \u2013 I don\u2019t really know what the difference is. Some of my favourite pieces of writing are classic novellas by Tolstoy or Melville or Henry James. They\u2019re very satisfying. They have the richness and depth of novels but the tightness of short stories. I\u2019m quite an impatient reader. I don\u2019t read very many long books.</p> <p><strong>What book is currently on your bedside table?</strong><br>A book about ancient Egypt called <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Mind_of_Egypt.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Mind of Egypt</em></a> by Jan Assmann.</p> <p><strong>What was the last great book you read?</strong><br>I was knocked out by Sally Rooney\u2019s <em>Conversations </em><em>With Friends</em>. I haven\u2019t read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/26/sally-rooney-normal-people-review-elegant-intelligent-tender\" title=\"\">the new one</a> but I\u2019m looking forward to it.

      "bodyText": "James Lasdun is a novelist, short-story writer, poet and film-maker. With Jonathan Nossiter, he co-wrote the films Sunday (1997) \u2013 which won the grand jury prize and the Waldo Salt screenwriting award at Sundance \u2013 and Signs &amp; Wonders (2000), starring Charlotte Rampling and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd. He was born in the UK \u2013 the son of architect Sir Denys Lasdun \u2013 but now lives and works in the US. He spoke to me from his home in the hills of upstate New York. His latest book, Victory, comprises two novellas \u2013 Feathered Glory and Afternoon of a Faun, both darkly humorous and compelling portraits of men wrestling with guilt and desire. Afternoon of a Faun is about a historical act coming to light years later. It feels very much a novel of our times. Was this intentional? I didn\u2019t write it as a #MeToo novel. I started it at the very beginning of 2017. Trump had been elected, then I was nearly finishing it as the Harvey Weinstein story broke and #MeToo started. I was totally caught off my guard. I didn\u2019t really see that coming and it was a little complicated for me. I could see in an opportunistic way that it connected very strongly\u2026 but it was sort of an accident. It called to mind another great short novel \u2013 JM Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace. I\u2019ve read Disgrace; it\u2019s an amazing novel. The story of sexual misconduct, of allegations \u2013 it\u2019s become a trope. So I\u2019m sure it had an effect on me, but so did many other novels, real-life stories, plays. Writers are really drawn to that subject for obvious reasons. It\u2019s of great interest to me and this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve written about it. I wrote about it in my first novel, The Horned Man. The first story, Feathered Glory, is, among other things, about an injured bird. We took in a swan at one point. My wife was working with a wildlife rehabilitator. I can\u2019t remember exactly how it came about, but I had a swan in a cage in the room that I was writing in. It was with us not a very long time, but it was a very powerful presence and I knew that one way or another I wanted to write about it. These are stories about toxic masculinity, but they\u2019re also about male friendship. I think male friendships are quite fascinating. I have very longstanding friendships with other men. Especially after you get married, you tend to conduct most of your close relationships outside of marriage with guys. I didn\u2019t want to write a satire of bad behaviours \u2013 I wanted it to get a lot of the different aspects of male behaviour down, not just the toxic elements. But that\u2019s a part of it, it\u2019s what drives the story. Different things seem toxic at different times, too; they\u2019re both stories that go over long-ish time periods in which social values shift and I wanted to capture a little bit of that. In the 2013 memoir, Give Me Everything You Have, you wrote \u2013 in a manner that stirred some controversy \u2013 about your experience of being stalked by a former student. I wondered how much that experience fed into these stories? I\u2019d been writing versions of that kind of narrative, of devastating interruption of a relatively stable life, before my whole stalker thing. In a strange way that episode fell into a pattern of things that was already part of my imaging. There were all these sorts of very bizarre resemblances between what happened with my stalker and what I\u2019d written in The Horned Man several years before. So it wasn\u2019t like this introduced me to a whole new emotional spectrum, but it did give me a horrific amount of psychic material to work with. It certainly made writing this kind of a story possible, perhaps inevitable. You write poems, prose, short stories, screenplays. In which medium do you feel most comfortable? I just think of myself as a writer. At various different times different forms have appealed more or less. I haven\u2019t been reading or writing poetry for a while, I\u2019m not sure why. I used to be able to do both at once and around about the time we had kids, something had to give. I don\u2019t feel terribly engaged with poetry at the moment. I hope that changes. Did the novella as a form particularly appeal to you? There seems to be something of a vogue at the moment for these shorter books. I do like short novels or novellas \u2013 I don\u2019t really know what the difference is. Some of my favourite pieces of writing are classic novellas by Tolstoy or Melville or Henry James. They\u2019re very satisfying. They have the richness and depth of novels but the tightness of short stories. I\u2019m quite an impatient reader. I don\u2019t read very many long books. What book is currently on your bedside table? A book about ancient Egypt called The Mind of Egypt by Jan Assmann. What was the last great book you read? I was knocked out by Sally Rooney\u2019s Conversations With Friends. I haven\u2019t read the new one but I\u2019m looking forward to it. It hasn\u2019t come out here yet. What book would you give to a young person? My son just loved Tintin. But also The Count of Monte Cristo. Which classic book have you recently read for the first time? I\u2019m doing a lot of rereading at the moment, much of it listening on audiobooks. I drive a lot and love listening to big books on tape. I\u2019d never got through The Devils by Dostoevsky, which I\u2019d tried to read maybe half a dozen times but never got there. I had to do a lot of driving \u2013 I was driving my son to Ohio where he goes to college \u2013 and I listened to it and it blew my mind. Which book do you always come back to? Anna Karenina. Partly it\u2019s the unfussy clarity of the style that gives you the feeling of looking straight at life without any interposing screen of words, and partly, it\u2019s the endlessly fascinating methods by which it organises its vast mass of materials into a coherent narrative, in which every tiny detail manages to be both luminous in itself and part of some transcendent vision of reality. Which is the book you\u2019re looking forward to reading next? The third part of the Rachel Cusk trilogy [Kudos]. I\u2019ve always admired her powers of observation and her amazingly lucid prose, but this project does things with concealment and disclosure that I\u2019ve never seen before, and that seem to open up new possibilities for the novel itself as a literary form. \u2022 Victory by James Lasdun is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a314.99).

      "body": "<p>BLAIR Kinghorn scored Scotland\u2019s first Championship hat-trick in 30 years as the home team got their Six Nations campaign off to a competent start against a limited Italian side. Stuart Hogg and Chris Harris also touched down as Gregor Townsend\u2019s team had the bonus point wrapped up with 25 minutes to play, but some chaos and confusion ensued in a final 10-minute spell which saw Italy, who previously had only a penalty to their name, claim three tries to put a gloss on the scoreline.</p> <p>The sin-binning of the substitute Simon Berghan was the catalyst for that late lapse, and Townsend is well aware that his team will have to tighten up in some respects before Ireland visit Murrayfield on Saturday. On balance, however, the head coach was satisfied with a performance during which his team improved significantly on the autumn Tests in areas such as the breakdown and the kick chase.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/feb/02/scotland-v-italy-six-nations-2019-live\">Scotland 33-20 Italy: Six Nations 2019 \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked if his players were down at the end of the game because of its unsatisfactory conclusion, Townsend suggested it could be regarded as a salutary reminder of the work they have to do before the tougher challenges that await.</p> <p>\u201cYes, and maybe it\u2019s not a bad thing. It\u2019s the first game of the tournament and we\u2019re playing the No 2 team in the world on Saturday. We\u2019re then going to a place where we\u2019ve not won in 20 years, then playing the No 3 team in the world, then going to a place where we haven\u2019t won since 1983.</p> <p>\u201cFeet on the ground is good for us,\u201d Townsend continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve started with a solid win and scoring five tries is a credit to the players. But we know next week\u2019s challenge is going to be huge and we have to get the focus right almost immediately. The players will start to absorb the gameplan and what we need to do better to win next week.\u201d</p> <p>The Italians might easily have conceded more than five tries, and though they did take an early lead through a Tommy Allan penalty, Scotland needed only two minutes to hit back through Kinghorn. Greig Laidlaw stole the ball at the breakdown following the restart, and Finn Russell angled an inch-perfect kick for Kinghorn to gather and run in from the edge of the opposition 22. Midway through the half Kinghorn again got on the end of a wide move to score.</p> <p>Josh Strauss, a substitute for the injured Sam Skinner, began the move with a pick-up from the base of a scrum. He fed Laidlaw, who switched direction to Russell, and the stand-off then looped around the debutant Sam Johnson before passing to Hogg. The full-back\u2019s pass to Kinghorn went to ground, but the left winger was nonetheless able to take it in his stride and sprint over in the corner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12eee04a616d9bdbf3c87f33569131f3be52c1b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12eee04a616d9bdbf3c87f33569131f3be52c1b1/0_0_2275_1549/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blair Kinghorn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blair Kinghorn of Scotland celebrates after he scores his team\u2019s fourth try.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Azzurri did rally towards half-time, but they were repelled. Scotland increased the tempo from the restart and a third try seemed only a matter of time. They got it after 47 minutes when Hogg beat Angelo Esposito in the race to ground a kick into the in-goal area from Russell \u2013 even though a replay cast doubt on how much downward pressure the scorer had exerted.</p> <p>Scotland had half an hour to get the fourth try and claim the bonus point. They only needed five minutes. Laidlaw and Jamie Ritchie exchanged passes, and the captain put Kinghorn through from 15 metres out. Another conversion made it 26-3.</p> <p>With the game won, Townsend went to his bench, and one of the replacements, Harris, got the fifth try with his first touch after another astute break by Hogg set up good position. With Laidlaw having given way to Ali Price, Russell took over the duties and converted to make it 33-3.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/02/warren-gatland-wales-france-six-nations-paris\">Warren Gatland\u2019s Wales head to Rome with another record on their minds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Italy rallied in what remained of the game, and scored three late tries. The first was from short range through Guglielmo Palazzani after Berghan had been sin-binned for collapsing the maul, with Allan\u2019s conversion taking them into the respectability of double figures.</p> <p>Edoardo Padovani got the second with a simple score after Scotland had run out of numbers on the right, but the substitute Ian McKinley was off target with the conversion. Angelo Esposito got the third, again from a break up the right, with two minutes left. The winger drop-kicked his conversion attempt back off the post.</p> <p>That late recovery notwithstanding, the Italians\u2019 limited contribution has to be a concern to Conor O\u2019Shea, who has yet to enjoy a win in the tournament as their coach. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t the ball \u2013 pretty simple,\u201d the coach said when asked to explain the defeat.</p> <p>\u201cIt felt like were defending the whole time.

      "bodyText": "BLAIR Kinghorn scored Scotland\u2019s first Championship hat-trick in 30 years as the home team got their Six Nations campaign off to a competent start against a limited Italian side. Stuart Hogg and Chris Harris also touched down as Gregor Townsend\u2019s team had the bonus point wrapped up with 25 minutes to play, but some chaos and confusion ensued in a final 10-minute spell which saw Italy, who previously had only a penalty to their name, claim three tries to put a gloss on the scoreline. The sin-binning of the substitute Simon Berghan was the catalyst for that late lapse, and Townsend is well aware that his team will have to tighten up in some respects before Ireland visit Murrayfield on Saturday. On balance, however, the head coach was satisfied with a performance during which his team improved significantly on the autumn Tests in areas such as the breakdown and the kick chase. Asked if his players were down at the end of the game because of its unsatisfactory conclusion, Townsend suggested it could be regarded as a salutary reminder of the work they have to do before the tougher challenges that await. \u201cYes, and maybe it\u2019s not a bad thing. It\u2019s the first game of the tournament and we\u2019re playing the No 2 team in the world on Saturday. We\u2019re then going to a place where we\u2019ve not won in 20 years, then playing the No 3 team in the world, then going to a place where we haven\u2019t won since 1983. \u201cFeet on the ground is good for us,\u201d Townsend continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve started with a solid win and scoring five tries is a credit to the players. But we know next week\u2019s challenge is going to be huge and we have to get the focus right almost immediately. The players will start to absorb the gameplan and what we need to do better to win next week.\u201d The Italians might easily have conceded more than five tries, and though they did take an early lead through a Tommy Allan penalty, Scotland needed only two minutes to hit back through Kinghorn. Greig Laidlaw stole the ball at the breakdown following the restart, and Finn Russell angled an inch-perfect kick for Kinghorn to gather and run in from the edge of the opposition 22. Midway through the half Kinghorn again got on the end of a wide move to score. Josh Strauss, a substitute for the injured Sam Skinner, began the move with a pick-up from the base of a scrum. He fed Laidlaw, who switched direction to Russell, and the stand-off then looped around the debutant Sam Johnson before passing to Hogg. The full-back\u2019s pass to Kinghorn went to ground, but the left winger was nonetheless able to take it in his stride and sprint over in the corner. The Azzurri did rally towards half-time, but they were repelled. Scotland increased the tempo from the restart and a third try seemed only a matter of time. They got it after 47 minutes when Hogg beat Angelo Esposito in the race to ground a kick into the in-goal area from Russell \u2013 even though a replay cast doubt on how much downward pressure the scorer had exerted. Scotland had half an hour to get the fourth try and claim the bonus point. They only needed five minutes. Laidlaw and Jamie Ritchie exchanged passes, and the captain put Kinghorn through from 15 metres out. Another conversion made it 26-3. With the game won, Townsend went to his bench, and one of the replacements, Harris, got the fifth try with his first touch after another astute break by Hogg set up good position. With Laidlaw having given way to Ali Price, Russell took over the duties and converted to make it 33-3. Italy rallied in what remained of the game, and scored three late tries. The first was from short range through Guglielmo Palazzani after Berghan had been sin-binned for collapsing the maul, with Allan\u2019s conversion taking them into the respectability of double figures. Edoardo Padovani got the second with a simple score after Scotland had run out of numbers on the right, but the substitute Ian McKinley was off target with the conversion. Angelo Esposito got the third, again from a break up the right, with two minutes left. The winger drop-kicked his conversion attempt back off the post. That late recovery notwithstanding, the Italians\u2019 limited contribution has to be a concern to Conor O\u2019Shea, who has yet to enjoy a win in the tournament as their coach. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t the ball \u2013 pretty simple,\u201d the coach said when asked to explain the defeat. \u201cIt felt like were defending the whole time. I\u2019m disappointed, because if we\u2019d held on to the ball we\u2019ve got players who can do damage. We know the challenge. We know we\u2019ve started a process that is doing the right thing \u2013 and we have a lot to do.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Premier League: Ben Foster was pressed into action on several occasions as Watford kept Brighton at bay in a dull encounter at the Amex Stadium. Premier League: Bobby Reid has put Cardiff City ahead with a penalty after five minutes and celebrated with his own personal tribute to Emiliano Sala, holding up a t-shirt adorned with a photo of Argentinian striker, who should have been playing tonight. Back in Cardiff: Team captains Andrew Surman and Sol Bamaba lay bunches of daffodils in the centre-circle in tribute to Emiliano Sala and his pilot Dave Ibbotson, before a minute\u2019s silence is impeccably observed. Cardiff kick off this game five points from safety at the bottom of the Premier League following Burnley\u2019s draw against Southampton. Premier League: Abject Everton lost their sixth match in nine league games to leave home fans seething at Goodison Park. Premier League: A last-gasp Ashley Barnes equaliser from the spot earned Burnley a share of the points at Turf Moor. Premier League: Jacob Steinberg was at Selhurst Park to see Michy Batshuayi come off the bench and make an instant impact for Crystal Palace. Premier League: Son Heung-min scored a late winner to send Tottenham second in the Premier League table. David Hytner was there ... Premier League: Dominic Fifield was at Stamford Bridge to see Chelsea spank five goals past doomed Huddersfield. Meanwhile in Wales: Cardiff City are playing Bournemouth in tonight\u2019s late kick-off, their first home game since the disappearance of their record signing Emiliano Sala. BT Sport are reporting that there\u2019s a sombre atmosphere at the ground, as Cardiff supporters prepare to pay tribute to the greatest striker they never saw. The club hierarchy have handed out daffodils buttonholes as the punters arrived, while I think members of his family have been looking at the tributes outside the stadium. As they warm up, Cardiff\u2019s players are wearing T-shirts adorned with Sala\u2019s picture.

Premier League: Burnley, who haven\u2019t had a penalty in their past 67 Premier League matches, are denied what looks a clear one when Ashley Barnes is brought down by Southampton goalkeeper Alex McCarthy. Barnes is booked for diving and goes crazy, effing and jeffing at the referee for all he\u2019s worth. He\u2019s lucky to avoid a red card and Southampton are equally fortunate not to be facing a penalty. Scottish Premiership: Having put his side ahead with one penalty scored after Jermain Defoe was brought down in the box, James Tavernier hits the post and misses a second in identical circumstances.

Scottish Premiership: Jermain Defoe is tripped in the penalty area and James Tavernier scores from the spot to give Rangers an early lead against bottom side St Mirren. Championship: Bradley Dack scores his 14th goal of the season to put Blackburn Rovers one up against Brentford at Griffin Park. League Two: In rather an early turn-up for the books, bottom side Notts County have taken an early lead against league leaders Lincoln City courtesy of Jon Stead. Not long now: Teams are out on pitches the length and breadth of the UK, going through the last of their pre-match formalities. Kick-off in today\u2019s three o\u2019clockers is just moments away. Fasten your seat-belts. Yes, even you Prince Philip. Match report: Tottenham 1-0 Newcastle United Premier League: David Hytner was at Wembley to watch SPurs leave it late to take all three points against Newcastle and move second in the Premier League. Here\u2019s how he saw it ... Meanwhile in Scotland Kilmarnock\u2019s title hopes took another hammer-blow last night as they lost to Hearts at home. With Celtic not playing until tomorrow at St Johnstone, here are today\u2019s fixtures. Premier League: Son Heung-min scored the only goal of the game late doors to give Tottenham the win and send them second in the table, within four points of league leaders Liverpool. They play West Ham on Monday night. Chelsea: Arrizabalaga, Azpilicueta, Christensen, Luiz, Alonso, Kante, Jorginho, Barkley, Willian, Higuain, Hazard. Subs: Rudiger, Pedro, Loftus-Cheek, Caballero, Kovacic, Giroud, Hudson-Odoi. Huddersfield: Lossl, Smith, Schindler, Kongolo, Lowe, Mooy, Bacuna, Billing, Mbenza, Kachunga, Diakhaby.

Referee: Paul Tierney (Lancashire) Brighton: Ryan, Montoya, Duffy, Dunk, Bong, Gross, Stephens, Propper, March, Murray, Locadia. Subs: Kayal, Bissouma, Andone, Knockaert, Balogun, Jahanbakhsh, Button. Watford: Foster, Janmaat, Mariappa, Cathcart, Holebas, Cleverley, Capoue, Hughes, Sema, Deulofeu, Deeney. Subs: Gomes, Britos, Masina, Chalobah, Penaranda, Gray, Quina. Referee: Simon Hooper (Wiltshire) Premier League: They\u2019ve been knocking on the door for some time and Spurs have finally broken the deadlock in their match against Newcastle at Wembley. Son Heung-min has bagged his second in two games since returning from the Asian Cup, but it was a soft one. In goal for Newcastle, Martin Dubravaka let the South Korean\u2019s long range effort squirm under his body and is visibly furious with himself. With Newcastle on the verge of losing their eighth consecutive match at Wembley Stadium in a run dating back nearly half a century, follow the closing stages here ...

Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland) Postponed games Six English League games have been postponed so far due to the cold snap currently prompting no end of shivering around the UK. In League One, Accrington v Blackpool has been called off. In League Two, the following five matches have fallen victim to the weather ... Cheltenham v Cambridge Crewe v Carlisle Swindon v Forest Green Oldham v Morecambe Port Vale v Tranmere League Two Top faces bottom as Lincoln City travel to Notts County, hoping to stretch their lead at the top of the table. Perhaps weirdly, second from top also face second from bottom, with Mansfield Town entertaining Sol Campbell\u2019s Macclesfield Town. League One Leaders Luton travel to Shrewsbury, while second placed Portsmouth entertain Doncaster Rovers. With at least two games in hand over their promotion rivals, Sunderland host bottom side AFC Wimbledon having takenb just three points from the last nine available. Jack Ross\u2019s side lost their top scorer Josh Maja to Bordeaux during the week, but have replaced him with Will Grigg, who Mackems will be hoping \u2013 as the song goes \u2013 is on fire. Championship Preston and Derby County played out a scoreless draw at Deepdale last night to get the weekend\u2019s Championship action started, but the pick of this weekend\u2019s fixtures kicks off later this evening at Elland Road, where first placed Leeds entertain second placed Norwich in what could be a thriller. Before that, Sheffield United could enhance their promotion credentials with a win over struggling Bolton, while West Brom could pull further away from Middlesbrough with a win at the Hawthorns. Nearer the foot of the table, Ipswich need a win against Sheffield Wednesday, while Millwall could do their chances of staying up no end of good with a home win over fellow strugglers Rotherham. Premier League Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United got the weekend\u2019s Premier League action under way in the lunchtime kick-off at Wembley, where it\u2019s currently scoreless at half-time. In today\u2019s three o\u2019clock kick-offs, Chelsea will have the chance to put their midweek embarrassment at the hands of Bournemouth behind them when they entertain Huddersfield Town, although Maurizio Sarri\u2019s side could very well plunge further down the shame well. At Selhurst Park in another game of note, Crystal Palace take on fellow strugglers Fulham in a match that could herald the appearance of several new arrivals to the Premier League. There\u2019ll be no shortage of it today, as we keep you updated on all the goals as they go in around the UK once today\u2019s three o\u2019clock kick-offs get under way. We\u2019ll provide regular score updates from all four divisions and the Scottish top flight, while bringing you news of all the major talking points as they unfold. Stay tuned for team news and build-up, then let us watch the football so you don\u2019t have to!",

It had been a good week for Newcastle, what with Tuesday\u2019s home win over Manchester City and the club-record transfer deadline-day signing of Miguel Almir\u00f3n, together with the loan of Antonio Barreca. But it would not get even better. Almir\u00f3n did not feature because he does not yet have his visa. \u201cTo concede the way we did was really disappointing,\u201d Ben\u00edtez said. \u201cI don\u2019t blame anyone [for the goal]. Everybody can make a mistake. It\u2019s a goal we could have avoided.\u201d Ben\u00edtez made the point that Newcastle had to be better on the ball in the second half but he felt they defended well in his 5-4-1 system while they enjoyed some encouragement on the counter-attack. Matt Ritchie was a threat with his crosses from left wing-back while Ayoze P\u00e9rez showed his twinkle-toes. Newcastle went close on the half-hour when Ritchie crossed and P\u00e9rez, who was gloriously placed, could not make a clean connection. Rond\u00f3n would be inches from scoring on 51 minutes when he headed against the upright from DeAndre Yedlin\u2019s cross while P\u00e9rez extended Hugo Lloris from the edge of the area. Tottenham had the greater number of chances and there were some gilt-edged ones, none more so than Lucas Moura\u2019s free header early on. Lamela nodded against the woodwork from Jan Vertonghen\u2019s cross; Moussa Sissoko was denied by Dubrakva while the substitute, Fernando Llorente, blew a looping header. Eriksen twice flicked goalwards following corners only for Fabian Sch\u00e4r and Ritchie to clear off the line. Sch\u00e4r\u2019s stretch back to hook away was particularly dramatic. Son, however, would cut through the frustration.",

They were investigated for slavery and domestic servitude.</p> <p>Three women had escaped from the same property a month earlier, having been held against their will for more than 30 years. Aishah Wahab, a 69-year-old Malaysian woman, and Josephine Herivel, a 57-year-old Irishwoman, met Balakrishnan, known as Comrade Bala, in London through a shared political ideology. He was the former Maoist leader of the Workers\u2019 Institute of Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Mao Zedong Thought. Rosie Davies, a 30-year-old British woman, had spent her whole life in servitude under Balakrishnan.</p> <p>The women were not physically restrained, but held by subjection to brainwashing, emotional abuse and physical abuse. Police were tipped off from a charity supporting victims of forced marriage, after receiving a phone call from the women, who had been watching the ITV documentary <em><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/granada/2015-09-29/forced-marriage-cops-channel-4-documentary-airs-tomorrow/\" title=\"\">Forced </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/granada/2015-09-29/forced-marriage-cops-channel-4-documentary-airs-tomorrow/\" title=\"\">to Marry</a></em>.</p> <p><strong>December 2015</strong><br>Balakrishnan was convicted of child cruelty, false imprisonment, four counts of rape, six counts of indecent assault and two counts of assault.

He had been struck by a car in 2004.</p> <p><strong>March 2011<br></strong>Gloucestershire Police carried out warrants at three properties in Gloucestershire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire. Nineteen vulnerable people were found living in squalid conditions at Beggers Roost caravan park in Cheltenham, subject to assault, theft of benefits and exploitation.</p> <p>Survivor Mark Ovenden reported that he was heading to his local soup kitchen in Bournemouth when a white van pulled over ahead of him. The driver approached him and offered him a job near Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire. He was taken to Beggers Roost and subjected to modern slavery for the following two years.</p> <p>Some of the rescued men had been kept at the Connors property for as long as 30 years and, having been institutionalised, did not recognise themselves as victims.</p> <p>Five members of the Connors family were charged with offences involving the serious mistreatment of people who, because of their personal circumstances, had little option but to remain with the family. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/19/traveller-family-jailed-forced-labour\" title=\"\">All five were found guilty</a> of conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour between April 2010 and March 2011 and are facing a maximum sentence of 14 years.</p> <h2>Hathway Walk, Easton, Bristol</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"821941104338b3e98fba8c6024ecd259c280002a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/821941104338b3e98fba8c6024ecd259c280002a/0_0_3000_2571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Dark Figure Hathway Walk, Easton, Bristol\" width=\"1000\" height=\"857\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>November 2014</strong><br>Police arrested 53-year-old Jurate Grigelyte at her property in Easton, Bristol, after a school raised concerns about the welfare of a six-year-old boy, who was discovered to be the son of a victim of human trafficking and forced labour, working under Grigelyte.</p> <p>Grigelyte trafficked Lithuanian nationals to the UK with the promise of good employment and accommodation, but instead would lock victims inside cramped, squalid properties, only allowing them to enter and leave through a window.</p> <p>The victims, many of whom spoke little to no English, worked for Grigelyte\u2019s charity bag business collecting donations and sorting through clothing. They were transported around the south-west in vans with no seats or windows. A typical working day lasted from 5am to 6pm. Grigelyte promised workers \u00a325 per day, but would deduct money for rent, travel and various fines, often leaving workers debt-bonded, with no money for food.</p> <p>Debt bondage is the world\u2019s most widespread form of slavery. A person becomes a bonded labourer when their labour is demanded as a means of repayment for a loan. The victim is then tricked or trapped into working for very little or no pay, to repay debts their employer says they owe. Often, the victim\u2019s identification is taken and bank cards are controlled, limiting any hope of freedom.</p> <p><strong>June 2015</strong><br>Grigelyte was sentenced to three years in prison after admitting to 10 charges of facilitating entry into the UK with a view to exploiting labour, 10 charges of human trafficking and one count of forced labour.</p> <h2>Walker Street, Rotherham, South Yorkshire</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f8a7afce941695d3d5d8d93cff3e2196966855a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f8a7afce941695d3d5d8d93cff3e2196966855a/0_0_3000_2571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Walker Street, Rawmarsh, Rotherham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"857\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>February 2016</strong><br>A gang of three brothers, their uncle and two women were found guilty of 55 serious offences, some of which had lain undetected for almost 20 years. Fifteen vulnerable girls, one as young as 11, were subjected to acts of sexual violence between 1987 and 2003 including rape, forced prostitution, indecent assault and false imprisonment.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/26/woman-offered-safe-haven-to-troubled-girls-then-pimped-them-out\" title=\"\">Karen MacGregor</a> was sentenced to 13 years for conspiracy to procure a child for prostitution, false imprisonment, and conspiracy to rape. MacGregor was a high-profile campaigner on behalf of abused children. In 2013, she founded KinKids, a community support group for kinship carers. MacGregor boasted that KinKids had helped families affected by the scandal. She had persuaded Rotherham council, local Labour MP John Healey and other local organisations to support KinKids in the wake of heightened investigation into cases of child abuse in Rotherham.</p> <p>She had been luring vulnerable girls to her home in Walker Street, which was described by one of the victims as akin to the Hansel and Gretel fairytale. There, she would groom them before pimping them out to earn their keep.</p> <p>One of her victims described how MacGregor was a motherly figure, who had taken her under her wing at a difficult time in her life and treated her like a daughter. Another victim recalled how within days of arriving, MacGregor had plied her with vodka to the point of unconsciousness and she had woken up to find herself being sexually assaulted.</p> <p>Since 2016, 33 men and one woman in this case have been imprisoned for rape, false imprisonment, sexual intercourse with a girl under 13, and indecent assault, for a total of 445 years and three months.</p> <p><strong>2017</strong><br>The conduct of more than 60 officers from South Yorkshire police who had dealt with the victims across the 20-year period is now under investigation. It is the largest Independent Police Complaints Commission inquiry since the 1989 Hillsborough football disaster.</p> <p>An inspection of Rotherham council found it was \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d after an independent inquiry into its handling of child sexual exploitation reports since 1997. The inquiry identified a culture of \u201cbullying, sexism ... and misplaced \u2018political correctness\u2019\u201d, along with a history of covering up information and silencing whistleblowers. The leader of the council, Paul Lakin, resigned, and the government replaced its elected officers with a team of five commissioners, including one tasked specifically with looking at children\u2019s services.</p> <h2>Batley Field Hill, Batley, West Yorkshire</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0715e718c661b5ecafaf4addf9ae4037e18bc03f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0715e718c661b5ecafaf4addf9ae4037e18bc03f/0_0_3000_2571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Dark FigureBatley Field Hill, Batley, Kirklees\" width=\"1000\" height=\"857\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>July 2013</strong><br>The authorities were alerted when a 20-year-old male trafficking victim contacted a charity, revealing he had been the victim of offences committed in 2011. More victims soon came forward, and others were identified. Convictions were made against Hungarian traffickers Janos Orsos and Ferenc Illes, who had been providing workers to Kozee Sleep, a bed factory that supplied retailers including John Lewis, Dunelm and Next.</p> <p>Company owner Mohammed Rafiq and two of his employees were charged with conspiracy to facilitate travel within the UK for exploitation. Rafiq was the first owner of a UK company to be charged with human trafficking offences.</p> <p>Workers supplied to Kozee Sleep were forced to live with up to 42 men in a two-bedroom house on Batley Field Hill, and were found to be surviving on scraps of food. The men would work for up to 20 hours a day and were paid as little as \u00a310 a week.</p> <p><strong>May 2014</strong><br>Janos Orsos pleaded guilty to conspiracy to traffic a person into the UK for exploitation, blackmail and converting criminal property. He was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment. Ferenc Illes pleaded guilty to conspiracy to traffic a person within the UK for exploitation. He was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment.</p> <p><strong>January 2016</strong><br>Mohammed Rafiq was found guilty of conspiracy to traffic and was sentenced to two years and three months in prison.

Some of the landscapes include main thoroughfares and popular byways, but nearly all the images are void of people; in every shot, it feels as if we are peering into a ghost town, waiting for the protagonists \u2013 or the action \u2013 to arrive. \u201cThe fact that there are no people makes you look a little bit closer and invites you to wonder what\u2019s happening in these images and why they\u2019re there,\u201d says Romer. \u201cIt\u2019s the idea that something\u2019s being hidden [that] gives them an eerie sense, and which is interesting, because the [locations also] look so normal and so like the town that you grew up in, or where I grew up.\u201d Though the term \u201cslavery next door\u201d may sound exaggerated, one of the Plymouth addresses Romer photographed happened to be just one street over from a flat she lived in; and in the book\u2019s foreword, Lancashire-born social justice educator Pete Brook writes that the Chorley house to which the Hungarian woman was trafficked was \u201cadjacent to cafes in which I\u2019ve sat and pubs in which I\u2019ve drunk\u201d. \u201cIt really homes in on the idea that slavery is happening on our doorstep,\u201d says Romer. The Dark Figure* began as Romer\u2019s third-year project at university but today the Home Office, local councils and British police use it as a training resource to help identify and raise awareness about modern-day slavery in its various forms. \u201cThe police actually uploaded a few of my photos on all their screen savers,\u201d says Romer, \u201cso whenever they log into their computers, they see my images. It\u2019s kind of crazy but really cool.\u201d The book was never intended for the coffee table anyway, says Romer, who self-funded a free poster in the book (the Bristol image, pictured above) about slavery in the UK. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to be a niche documentary photo book. I want this project to teach. I want it to raise awareness,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m asking people to put up the poster in their local community centre or somewhere that it\u2019ll get seen. I want [people] to actually learn something from it.\u201d The Dark Figure* by Amy Romer is published later this month by Another Place, \u00a316 A selection of photographs from The Dark Figure*, captioned by Amy Romer Peckford Place, Brixton, London November 2013 Metropolitan police from the Human Trafficking Unit arrested 73-year-old Aravindan Balakrishnan and his wife, 67-year-old Chanda Pattni, at their residential address in Brixton. They were investigated for slavery and domestic servitude. Three women had escaped from the same property a month earlier, having been held against their will for more than 30 years. Aishah Wahab, a 69-year-old Malaysian woman, and Josephine Herivel, a 57-year-old Irishwoman, met Balakrishnan, known as Comrade Bala, in London through a shared political ideology. He was the former Maoist leader of the Workers\u2019 Institute of Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Mao Zedong Thought. Rosie Davies, a 30-year-old British woman, had spent her whole life in servitude under Balakrishnan. The women were not physically restrained, but held by subjection to brainwashing, emotional abuse and physical abuse. Police were tipped off from a charity supporting victims of forced marriage, after receiving a phone call from the women, who had been watching the ITV documentary Forced to Marry. December 2015 Balakrishnan was convicted of child cruelty, false imprisonment, four counts of rape, six counts of indecent assault and two counts of assault. Chanda Pattni, had been released without charge in 2014. Balakrishnan was sentenced to 23 years in prison in January 2016. Bamfurlong Lane, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire May 2008 The discovery of the remains of a body in a garden shed near Bamfurlong Lane triggered a year-long investigation, including a five-month surveillance operation in 2010 of the Connors family\u2019s traveller sites. The body was identified as that of Christopher Nicholls, who had been working for the Connors for three years and had been reported missing by his parents in 2005. He had been struck by a car in 2004. March 2011 Gloucestershire Police carried out warrants at three properties in Gloucestershire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire. Nineteen vulnerable people were found living in squalid conditions at Beggers Roost caravan park in Cheltenham, subject to assault, theft of benefits and exploitation. Survivor Mark Ovenden reported that he was heading to his local soup kitchen in Bournemouth when a white van pulled over ahead of him. The driver approached him and offered him a job near Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire. He was taken to Beggers Roost and subjected to modern slavery for the following two years. Some of the rescued men had been kept at the Connors property for as long as 30 years and, having been institutionalised, did not recognise themselves as victims. Five members of the Connors family were charged with offences involving the serious mistreatment of people who, because of their personal circumstances, had little option but to remain with the family. All five were found guilty of conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour between April 2010 and March 2011 and are facing a maximum sentence of 14 years. Hathway Walk, Easton, Bristol November 2014 Police arrested 53-year-old Jurate Grigelyte at her property in Easton, Bristol, after a school raised concerns about the welfare of a six-year-old boy, who was discovered to be the son of a victim of human trafficking and forced labour, working under Grigelyte. Grigelyte trafficked Lithuanian nationals to the UK with the promise of good employment and accommodation, but instead would lock victims inside cramped, squalid properties, only allowing them to enter and leave through a window. The victims, many of whom spoke little to no English, worked for Grigelyte\u2019s charity bag business collecting donations and sorting through clothing. They were transported around the south-west in vans with no seats or windows. A typical working day lasted from 5am to 6pm. Grigelyte promised workers \u00a325 per day, but would deduct money for rent, travel and various fines, often leaving workers debt-bonded, with no money for food. Debt bondage is the world\u2019s most widespread form of slavery. A person becomes a bonded labourer when their labour is demanded as a means of repayment for a loan. The victim is then tricked or trapped into working for very little or no pay, to repay debts their employer says they owe. Often, the victim\u2019s identification is taken and bank cards are controlled, limiting any hope of freedom. June 2015 Grigelyte was sentenced to three years in prison after admitting to 10 charges of facilitating entry into the UK with a view to exploiting labour, 10 charges of human trafficking and one count of forced labour. Walker Street, Rotherham, South Yorkshire February 2016 A gang of three brothers, their uncle and two women were found guilty of 55 serious offences, some of which had lain undetected for almost 20 years. Fifteen vulnerable girls, one as young as 11, were subjected to acts of sexual violence between 1987 and 2003 including rape, forced prostitution, indecent assault and false imprisonment. Karen MacGregor was sentenced to 13 years for conspiracy to procure a child for prostitution, false imprisonment, and conspiracy to rape. MacGregor was a high-profile campaigner on behalf of abused children. In 2013, she founded KinKids, a community support group for kinship carers. MacGregor boasted that KinKids had helped families affected by the scandal. She had persuaded Rotherham council, local Labour MP John Healey and other local organisations to support KinKids in the wake of heightened investigation into cases of child abuse in Rotherham. She had been luring vulnerable girls to her home in Walker Street, which was described by one of the victims as akin to the Hansel and Gretel fairytale. There, she would groom them before pimping them out to earn their keep. One of her victims described how MacGregor was a motherly figure, who had taken her under her wing at a difficult time in her life and treated her like a daughter. Another victim recalled how within days of arriving, MacGregor had plied her with vodka to the point of unconsciousness and she had woken up to find herself being sexually assaulted. Since 2016, 33 men and one woman in this case have been imprisoned for rape, false imprisonment, sexual intercourse with a girl under 13, and indecent assault, for a total of 445 years and three months. 2017 The conduct of more than 60 officers from South Yorkshire police who had dealt with the victims across the 20-year period is now under investigation. It is the largest Independent Police Complaints Commission inquiry since the 1989 Hillsborough football disaster. An inspection of Rotherham council found it was \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d after an independent inquiry into its handling of child sexual exploitation reports since 1997. The inquiry identified a culture of \u201cbullying, sexism ... and misplaced \u2018political correctness\u2019\u201d, along with a history of covering up information and silencing whistleblowers. The leader of the council, Paul Lakin, resigned, and the government replaced its elected officers with a team of five commissioners, including one tasked specifically with looking at children\u2019s services. Batley Field Hill, Batley, West Yorkshire July 2013 The authorities were alerted when a 20-year-old male trafficking victim contacted a charity, revealing he had been the victim of offences committed in 2011. More victims soon came forward, and others were identified. Convictions were made against Hungarian traffickers Janos Orsos and Ferenc Illes, who had been providing workers to Kozee Sleep, a bed factory that supplied retailers including John Lewis, Dunelm and Next. Company owner Mohammed Rafiq and two of his employees were charged with conspiracy to facilitate travel within the UK for exploitation. Rafiq was the first owner of a UK company to be charged with human trafficking offences. Workers supplied to Kozee Sleep were forced to live with up to 42 men in a two-bedroom house on Batley Field Hill, and were found to be surviving on scraps of food. The men would work for up to 20 hours a day and were paid as little as \u00a310 a week. May 2014 Janos Orsos pleaded guilty to conspiracy to traffic a person into the UK for exploitation, blackmail and converting criminal property. He was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment. Ferenc Illes pleaded guilty to conspiracy to traffic a person within the UK for exploitation. He was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment. January 2016 Mohammed Rafiq was found guilty of conspiracy to traffic and was sentenced to two years and three months in prison. He pleaded not guilty. Cunliffe Street, Chorley, Lancashire 2013 A young Hungarian woman was captured and trafficked to the UK after responding to an advert for a babysitting job. She was sold to a Pakistani man for \u00a33,500, and held at various addresses in Gorton, Longsight and Levenshulme in Manchester, before being taken to Chorley, where she was able to alert police. 2015 Bartolomej Sivak, the organiser of the operation, was jailed for four years for trafficking and conspiracy to facilitate a breach of immigration law. His assistant, Rana Yousaf, who assisted in moving of the victim, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to facilitate a breach of immigration law and was sentenced to 20 months; and his fixer, Nasar Khan, to three years. Waqas Younus is still wanted in relation to the investigation.",

      "bodyText": "The San Francisco district attorney\u2019s office on Friday dropped all charges against three San Francisco sheriff\u2019s deputies accused of forcing inmates to fight for their entertainment. The San Francisco district attorney, George Gasc\u00f3n, filed charges against deputies Scott Neu, Eugene Jones, and Clifford Chiba in March 2016, a year after the city\u2019s public defender brought forth allegations of an inmate \u201cfight club\u201d. But prosecutors claim they were forced to dismiss the charges this week because the same sheriff\u2019s department that employed the accused mishandled the investigation and destroyed evidence, including by smashing a lead investigator\u2019s laptop with a hammer because it had gotten a virus. The dismissal of charges against the deputies once again raised questions over the effectiveness of investigations when law enforcement agencies investigate their own. \u201cThis case illustrates why agencies shouldn\u2019t be tasked with investigating themselves,\u201d said Alex Bastian, a spokesman for the district attorney. Adante Pointer, a civil rights attorney whose office represented some of the inmates involved, said: \u201cThis is an all-too familiar story where law enforcement is not held accountable, and it begs the question whether or not the people who are supposed to hold them accountable have the integrity to do so. \u201cOnce again, it is shown that there are two different criminal justice systems in this country,\u201d Pointer added. Three former inmates at a San Francisco county jail alleged that Neu, Jones, and Chiba arranged \u201cgladiator-style\u201d battles in the jail in 2015, threatening physical abuse, sexual abuse, transfers to more dangerous jails, and the loss of lucrative jail job assignments if the inmates refused to fight. The deputies organized the fights in areas in the jail where there were no cameras, and they told the inmates to lie if they needed medical attention, the inmates alleged. The three inmates, Ricardo Palikiko-Garcia, Stanley Harris and Keith Richardson, sued the sheriff\u2019s department and the city in federal civil court in 2016and settled their lawsuit with the city later that year for $90,000. Meanwhile, the criminal case proceeded. Last month, Neu alleged in a court filing that investigators had violated his constitutional rights by using a \u201ccompelled statement\u201d to build their case against him. Law enforcement officers are required to give such a statement to administrative investigators during internal affairs investigations, but the statement cannot legally be used in criminal investigations because that would violate a defendant\u2019s fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. Internal affairs inquiries and criminal investigations are typically kept separate for this reason, and compelled statements are kept from the prosecution. But lead investigators in both inquiries testified that they conducted witness interviews and developed questions together, assistant chief district attorney Evan Ackiron wrote in the motion to dismiss the charges. The legal counsel for the sheriff\u2019s department also sent a 2017 email to a prosecutor containing \u201call of the compelled statements of the defendants\u201d, the motion notes. Separately, Neu\u2019s attorneys discovered that the lead administrative investigator in the case had a practice of \u201cdouble deleting\u201d emails, according to the motion. When Neu\u2019s attorneys sought to search his laptop, they were informed that \u201cthe laptop had been destroyed sometime in October 2016 because it had gotten a virus\u201d. Nancy Crowley, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco sheriff, Vicki Hennessy, said the California attorney general\u2019s office instructed the sheriff\u2019s department to smash hard drives containing sensitive information with a hammer when disposing of them. Since taking office in 2016, Hennessy has worked to \u201cupdate and reaffirm the department\u2019s criminal and administrative procedures and institute training to ensure the integrity of all investigations and ensure accountability\u201d, Crowley said. The district attorney\u2019s office plans to forward the case to its own independent investigations bureau, prosecutors said on Friday. But an attorney for Neu does not believe prosecutors will be able to successfully refile charges. \u201cI\u2019m very familiar with the evidence in this case and I think it\u2019s impossible for them to divorce themselves from the constitutional violations,\u201d Harry Stern told the Guardian. Stern admitted shortly after the allegations emerged in 2015 that the fights had taken place, but he has maintained over the years they were mischaracterized. \u201cIt was really just people being allowed to blow off some steam, engage in horseplay,\u201d Stern said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a fight club, it wasn\u2019t gladiator games, it wasn\u2019t anything like that.\u201d Neu has faced other allegations of misconduct in the past. He was accused a decade prior to sexually assaulting three inmates. They alleged that Neu groped them, and forced them to kiss him, show him their genitals and perform oral sex on him. They say he threatened to beat them or send them to a jail with harsher conditions if they reported him. All three cases were settled out of court in 2009 for $97,500.",

      "body": "<p>A record-breaking 16-lengths success in the Irish Champion Hurdle here on Saturday was still not enough to secure Apple\u2019s Jade a place in its British equivalent on the first day of the Cheltenham Festival next month. Gordon Elliott\u2019s mare will be at the track on 12 March but she seems likely to run in the Mares\u2019 Hurdle rather than the Champion, despite showing form here that would make her a plausible favourite to beat Buveur D\u2019Air, the champion for the last two years.</p> \n<p>Buveur D\u2019Air was also in action on Saturday, winning the Contenders Hurdle at Sandown by two lengths at odds of 1-5, and Nicky Henderson, his trainer, seemed as surprised as anyone to hear that Apple\u2019s Jade is not expected to line up against the dual champion at Cheltenham, where she would get a 7lb mares\u2019 allowance.</p> \n<p>There is still time for Michael O\u2019Leary, Apple\u2019s Jade\u2019s owner, to have a sudden change of heart and Elliott also suggested here that the Mares\u2019 Hurdle option is not set in stone. However, Eddie O\u2019Leary, Michael\u2019s brother and racing manager, insisted repeatedly that he sees no reason to switch her away from the Mares\u2019 Hurdle.</p> \n<p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re tempted and it will be Michael who will decide, but I\u2019d go to the Mares\u2019 Hurdle because you\u2019re qualified,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s won the Irish Champion Hurdle, and by the way, she failed in the Mares\u2019 Hurdle last year, so it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re going there as a certainty. So all going well, I\u2019d say that\u2019s where we\u2019re going.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve a good mare and we\u2019re going to enjoy her while we can.

      "bodyText": "A record-breaking 16-lengths success in the Irish Champion Hurdle here on Saturday was still not enough to secure Apple\u2019s Jade a place in its British equivalent on the first day of the Cheltenham Festival next month. Gordon Elliott\u2019s mare will be at the track on 12 March but she seems likely to run in the Mares\u2019 Hurdle rather than the Champion, despite showing form here that would make her a plausible favourite to beat Buveur D\u2019Air, the champion for the last two years. Buveur D\u2019Air was also in action on Saturday, winning the Contenders Hurdle at Sandown by two lengths at odds of 1-5, and Nicky Henderson, his trainer, seemed as surprised as anyone to hear that Apple\u2019s Jade is not expected to line up against the dual champion at Cheltenham, where she would get a 7lb mares\u2019 allowance. There is still time for Michael O\u2019Leary, Apple\u2019s Jade\u2019s owner, to have a sudden change of heart and Elliott also suggested here that the Mares\u2019 Hurdle option is not set in stone. However, Eddie O\u2019Leary, Michael\u2019s brother and racing manager, insisted repeatedly that he sees no reason to switch her away from the Mares\u2019 Hurdle. \u201cOf course you\u2019re tempted and it will be Michael who will decide, but I\u2019d go to the Mares\u2019 Hurdle because you\u2019re qualified,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s won the Irish Champion Hurdle, and by the way, she failed in the Mares\u2019 Hurdle last year, so it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re going there as a certainty. So all going well, I\u2019d say that\u2019s where we\u2019re going. \u201cWe\u2019ve a good mare and we\u2019re going to enjoy her while we can. We haven\u2019t got one gelding that\u2019s qualified for the Mares\u2019 Hurdle. As of now, it\u2019s long odds-on [that she will run in that race] and I think people will remember her regardless, she\u2019s a great mare.\u201d Apple\u2019s Jade is generally the clear second-favourite at 9-4 for the Champion Hurdle with bookmakers offering a \u201cnon-runner, no bet\u201d concession, but a 6-1 chance with Hills, who are \u201call-in\u201d, meaning that stakes are lost if she does not run. In the Mares\u2019 Hurdle betting, she is odds-on at 4-7, while Buveur D\u2019Air\u2019s price for the Champion Hurdle ranges from 11-10 to 13-8. Racegoers and punters may well feel a little short-changed if Apple\u2019s Jade lines up for the Mares\u2019 Hurdle rather than the Champion, a move that would simultaneously reduce the competitiveness of both events. The option exists, though, following the extension of the Festival from three days to four, and some dilution of the depth and quality of the championship events was inevitable as a result. Min, who took the Grade One Dublin Chase at odds-on, also has options at the Festival and his connections will take their time before deciding whether to take on Altior in the Champion Chase or move up in trip in the Ryanair Chase the following day. There was a miserable postscript to Saturday\u2019s race, however, when it was confirmed that Henry de Bromhead\u2019s bold-jumping front-runner Special Tiara, the 2017 Champion Chase winner, had been put down after suffering a serious leg injury in the early stages. Le Richebourg, the 11-10 favourite, stayed on strongly to take the Grade One Arkle Novice Chase for Joseph O\u2019Brien and will now head to the race of a similar name at Cheltenham as the likely favourite, though his task was eased when Voix Du Reve fell at the last fence when close behind the winner. The only Grade One event of the afternoon in Britain was the Scilly Isles Novice Chase at Sandown, where Kim Bailey\u2019s Vinndication set off as favourite to maintain an unbeaten record over jumps but could finish only third behind Defi Du Seuil, the 2017 Triumph Hurdle winner, and Lostintranslation, who had beaten him in the Dipper Novice Chase at Cheltenham in January. The two horses are expected to renew rivalry in the JLT Novice Chase at Cheltenham and are closely matched at the top of the betting, with Defi Du Seuil a narrow 6-1 favourite ahead of Lostintranslation on 7-1.",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m heading over to Ireland v England now: We\u2019ll have a full report online shortly. Thanks for joining me. Bye! Here\u2019s the man of the match, Blair Kinghorn: \u201cDelighted with the result, we dug it out at the end to get the win.\u201d \u201cCredit to our boys, they were awesome \u2013 and credit to Italy too.\u201d Textbook stuff from the lad, even referring to the ground as \u201cBT Murrayfield\u201d. Greig Laidlaw is critical of those late defensive mistakes \u2013 pointing out that Ireland will punish those kind of lapses severely in their next home game. It\u2019s all over! Scotland were dominant throughout and 33-3 up after an hour, but allowed Italy three late tries after downing tools towards the end. Hmm. Scotland are a man down, and have taken their foot off the gas, but Gregor Townsend may still be concerned that Italy have scored three tries here. Angelo Esposito is the man to break beyond the home defence this time, but misses a cheeky drop-goal conversion attempt. Last change for Scotland, with Adam Hastings replacing Russell. Scotland thought they had a sixth try, but now Italy have a second \u2013 it\u2019s a lovely move, too, the visitors upping the pace with their extra man before Ruzza offloads to Padovani for the score. McKinley misses the conversion. Just before that, McKinley had come back on for Tommaso Allan. There was also a significant change for Scotland, with Gary Graham coming on for his first cap. The Newcastle forward has previously attended England training camps. 72 mins: Stuart Hogg collects a kick, and sidesteps into the space created by Ali Price. He races into the corner, beaming from ear to ear \u2013 but Price is penalised for obstruction! Italy make the advantage count, with Palazzani collecting from a tackle and squirming in under the posts. Allan converts, and the Italian fans at least have something to cheer. 70 mins: Italy kick to the corner and win a lineout that Scotland don\u2019t contest. Italy roll for the line, and Berghan gets a yellow card for collapsing the maul! 67 mins: Italy mount an attack, with Scotland conceding a few penalties and getting a warning from the referee. Finn Russell, the new captain now that Laidlaw is off, is advised to sort his troops out. 64 mins: Laidlaw converts, as Jake Kerr comes on for his debut, replacing McInally. For Italy, Ferrari is wheeled back to the garage, replaced by Federico Ruzza. Scotland piling up the points now, an Italian clearing kick landing with Hogg, who is given too much space and dances to within five metres before offloading to Toolis, who is only denied by an almighty blindside tackle. Scotland work the ball to the right, where Strauss barrels forward and finds Chris Harris, who dots down for his first Scotland try! 60 mins: An hour played, and Italy have spent 14 seconds in the Scottish 22. 59 mins: Italy changes \u2013 Ghiraldini and Negri head off, replaced by Luca Bigi and Tiziano Pasquali. 58 mins: Italy launch a rare attack, but a handling error stops them in their tracks. Changes for Scotland: Jamie Bhatti, Ali Price and Chris Harris are on, replacing Dell, Laidlaw and Huw Jones. 56 mins: It\u2019s been a long afternoon for Italy, and there\u2019s still plenty of time to go. Scotland have wrapped up a bonus point with their fourth try, and are set to make a few changes now the game is won. Russell offloads beautifully to Allan Dell, who smashes a hole in the defence, allowing Jamie Ritchie to make headway. He finds Laidlaw, who shifts the ball to Kinghorn, who spins through the gap and over for his third try, converted by Laidlaw. 53 mins: Berghan spills the ball but Russell gathers, and Scotland come again. Italy knock on, but Pearce plays advantage... 52 mins: More changes in the Italian pack: Budd and Lovotti are off, replaced by Cherif Traore and Jimmy Tuivaiti. 51 mins: A couple of changes \u2013 Simon Berghan replaces WP Nel for Scotland, while Edoardo Padovani is on for Castello. 50 mins: Palazzani, who has had a quiet afternoon so far, suddenly sprints downfield, but is denied a run for the line by Wilson\u2019s tackle. Scotland get the scrum for a knock-on; replays show it should have been Italy\u2019s ball. Scotland win the lineout and Laidlaw finds Seymour, who cuts through the Italian defence. The ball is recycled, and Russell pokes a lovely no-look kick beyond the try line. Stuart Hogg is onto it, and beats Esposito to get a hand to the ball! Laidlaw converts, and Scotland have a bit of breathing space. 45 mins: Scotland pour forward to put pressure on the Italian backs, with Hogg tackling Hayward, who offloads to Allan. The fly-half finds touch well with the white shirts circling... 43 mins: The referee is having a look at a potentially dangerous tackle by McInally on Dean Budd, who was on his knees. No yellow card, but an Italian penalty. 42 mins: ...Italy fail to clear their lines and Scotland come again, Laidlaw the conductor as Strauss tries to bash his way through. Scotland work the ball right but Ryan Wilson\u2019s ambitious attempt an an offload goes forward. 41 mins: Hogg pounces on a poor kick, collecting and slaloming deep into Italy territory before Lovotti hauls him down... Hogg sets the second half started for Scotland. Half-time reading Michael Aylwin looks back at Wales\u2019s dramatic win in Paris, and forward to their trip to Rome: Our new columnist, Ugo Monye, tells us what to expect when Ireland and England face off: And if you want to keep up to date on all things rugby in this World Cup year, why not sign up for The Breakdown, our weekly newsletter? Scotland have been the better side, with Blair Kinghorn finishing two delightful attacking moves \u2013 but much like the bagpipes in the background, the half got less appealing as it went on. More soon. 39 mins: As the Murrayfield piper pipes on and on, Scotland go looking for a third try before half-time. Parisse rescues Italy, forcing Scotland to hang onto the ball \u2013 and they should get to the break just nine points behind. 37 mins: Seymour stops an Italian attack with a tackle on Campagnaro, and the visitors are penalised to end that foray forward. 36 mins: Scotland are solid enough at their lineout and clear the danger. Tomasso Allan is back on for McKinley after his concussion check. 35 mins: An exchange of kicks between the full backs, before Hayward produces a beauty of a diagonal ball that rolls into touch, deep into Scots territory... 34 mins: Luke Pearce has had enough of the stop-start scrums, telling both sets of players he will start penalising people. No time like the present, surely \u2013 but Italy get the ball away this time. 33 mins: Willem Nel needs the attention of two physios but gets back up, adjusts his shorts and gets set for another scrum, which immediately falls in on itself. 31 mins: Hayward does well to deal with an up-and-under, with Josh Strauss\u2019s considerable frame bearing down on him. McKinley finds touch with a clearing kick, Italy trying their best to keep the gap down to single figures with half-time approaching. 29 mins: Scotland can\u2019t make the most of that penalty as we endure another spell of scrappy scrummage, before Italy get a penalty and McKinley clears. Tommaso Allen is going off for a head injury assessment \u2013 he\u2019s replaced by Ian McKinley, who plays in protective goggles after losing his sight in one eye: 26 mins: Scotland get a penalty after an Italian scrum goes down. Italy are not happy with some of the referee\u2019s decisions here, but that looked fair enough. 23 mins: Scotland have started very well here, punishing Italian mistakes and showing some nice variety in their attacking play. The only blemish is the injury to Skinner, back on the bench with crutches and an ice pack for his knee. Ruthless from Scotland here, Laidlaw finding Russell who triggers a blur of passes out wide, with Hogg\u2019s final ball bouncing into the arms of Kinghorn, who snatches his second try! Laidlaw nails the conversion this time. 19 mins: Scotland take a quick throw from a lineout, setting up an attack from which Laidlaw plays a smart diagonal kick, putting Hayward under pressure. Italy look to have cleared the danger, but Tommaso Castello knocks on 5m out, and it\u2019ll be a Scotland scrum... 17 mins: That lively start has drifted, with a spell of scrappy scrums, Scotland\u2019s the more unstable and first before Italy engage too early. 14 mins: Italy had defended so solidly, but it was an error that allowed Laidlaw to start that attacking move. For Scotland, flanker Sam Skinner has been forced off with an injury \u2013 he\u2019s replaced by Josh Strauss. The fly-half produces an inch-perfect kick to Kinghorn, in acres of space on the left flank \u2013 and the wing races over the line unopposed! Laidlaw misses a tricky conversion. 11 mins: Italy surrender the ball on their own 22, Laidlaw snaffling the ball after the referee gave him the green light. The ball is switched to Finn Russell, in front of the posts... The fly-half slots it over from just to the left of centre, and Italy lead! 8 mins: Italy get on the front foot from Hayward\u2019s kick forward, and Parisse takes a low hit from Jamie Ritchie. Italy penalty \u2013 no more than that after a TMO review \u2013 which Allan will take... 6 mins: From the set-piece, Blair Kinghorn skips through the Italian defence, who regroup and force Scotland to move centrally. The visitors hold firm, Tommaso Allan making a key tackle, and forcing a penalty when Hogg hangs onto the ball. 5 mins: Palazzani, a late addition to the Italy fifteen, shows plenty of ring-rust with a kick that flies into the stand. Scotland with another chance to attack... 4 mins: Ryan Wilson is up like a salmon in the lineout and Scotland roll ominously towards the line, with the ball under Grant Gilchrist\u2019s arm. The referee awards the try, but consults with the TMO, who spots a double movement from the Edinburgh lock. No try! 2 mins: After a spell of possession, Hogg bursts down the left and finds Laidlaw, whose kick through has to be shinned into touch by the last Italian man. Scottish lineout, five metres out... 1 min: Scotland, in their white and navy change strip, launch the first attack, debutant Sam Johnson with a lovely sidestep to open things up... Tomasso Allen kicks off for Italy, playing in their first-choice azure shirts. We\u2019ve had bagpipes, and a marching band playing The Proclaimers. Textbook Edinburgh. Now the anthems, Italy first, then a reliably rousing \u2018Flower of Scotland\u2019, belted out by a sell-out crowd. Scotland, of course, have plenty of injury problems of their own. They\u2019re without around a dozen players, including captain John Barclay, wing Sean Maitland and forwards Jonny and Richie Gray. A late change for Italy, with scrum-half Tito Tebaldi pulling up in the warm-up. Zebre\u2019s Guglielmo Palazzani steps in off the bench. Fortress Murrayfield A strong stat from Gracenote\u2019s Simon Gleave: \u201cScotland have become a formidable team to play at Murrayfield, scoring at least 25 points (and two tries) in each of their last six home matches in the Six Nations since losing 15-9 against England in March 2016. They\u2019ve beaten every one of their Six Nations rivals in that winning run, including France twice.\u201d In case you missed it, the Six Nations kicked off in style last night, with Wales rallying from 16-0 down to win in Paris. Scotland: 15 Stuart Hogg, 14 Tommy Seymour, 13 Huw Jones, 12 Sam Johnson, 11 Blair Kinghorn, 10 Finn Russell, 9 Greig Laidlaw; 1 Allan Dell, 2 Stuart McInally, 3 WP Nel, 4 Ben Toolis, 5 Grant Gilchrist, 6 Sam Skinner, 7 Jamie Ritchie, 8 Ryan Wilson.

      "body": "<p>In all the heat and light of prediction surrounding this year\u2019s Oscar shortlists, one category appears easier to call than most. Regina King has long been an odds-on favourite as best supporting actress for her role in the adaptation of James Baldwin\u2019s novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/18/james-baldwin-if-beale-street-could-talk-interview-1974\" title=\"\">If Beale Street Could Talk</a></em>. At 48, King is having something of a repetitive red carpet moment. Of the dozen nominations she has received for her performance from different award ceremonies, she has so far come out on top in 11, including the Golden Globes. When I spoke to her on the phone in Los Angeles, she was inevitably in the midst of hair and makeup for another round of accolades that evening. \u201cI have never really been a part of this thing called awards season,\u201d she said, with a low laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s like a new full-time job. I\u2019m not complaining \u2013 just stating!\u201d</p> <p>The proper recognition of King\u2019s screen presence is stupidly overdue. Since her movie debut in John Singleton\u2019s <em>Boyz n the Hood</em> she has made a speciality of providing the emotional scaffolding of numerous films and TV series, the superstructure on which other, flashier talents can rely. The pattern was set in <em>Jerry Maguire</em>, where King played the kickass wife of a self-destructive American football star, and delivered a true beating heart to set against the hyperactive bromance between Cuba Gooding Jr and Tom Cruise. She has in the past decade graduated to pivotal roles in the garlanded TV series <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jan/06/american-crime-second-season-must-watch-tv-2016\" title=\"\">American Crime</a></em>, and as the Emmy award-winning star in last year\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/23/seven-seconds-review-netflix-drama-series\" title=\"\">Seven Seconds</a></em> in which she played, with ravaged grace, a mother fighting for Black Lives Matter justice for a son killed by a white police officer in a car accident.</p> <p>All of that intensity is brought to bear in <em>If Beale Street Could Talk,</em> the film that director Barry Jenkins chose to follow the triumph of <em>Moonlight</em>. From the moment we are introduced to King in the movie \u2013 in the kitchen of a 1970s Harlem apartment while her young daughter prepares to break the news that she is expecting the baby of her boyfriend, who is wrongfully in prison \u2013 we know that we are in the safest of hands. King locates every quiet nuance of human drama in those pregnant pauses. Her eventual response, shaping the news within the family, is not only one of the most beautifully constructed scenes among this year\u2019s Oscar films but also a kind of exemplar of compassionate motherhood. King\u2019s performance is all about love.</p> <p>She was contacted about the role while she was directing an episode of the TV comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/07/this-is-us-review-us-drama\" title=\"\">This Is Us</a>, one of several recent ventures behind the camera. \u201cI opened the email and read James Baldwin, Barry Jenkins,\u201d she recalls. \u201cSo it didn\u2019t take much twisting my arm. It was a \u2018you had me at hello\u2019 moment.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3-L3HFC0NY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V3-L3HFC0NY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3-L3HFC0NY\">Watch a trailer for If Beale Street Could Talk</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>As soon as she read Jenkins\u2019s script and Baldwin\u2019s book, she knew exactly the woman she was playing. It was her grandmother, with bits of her mother and auntie thrown in.</p> <p>\u201cMy grandmother was similar to this character in that she was the type of human being that whenever you were around her you felt better about the situation you were in.\u201d</p> <p>In King\u2019s other critical moment in the film she has gone to Puerto Rico to confront her son-in-law\u2019s absconded accuser. The camera dwells on her trying to steel herself for the encounter in a hotel room, putting on and taking off a bobbed wig. In Baldwin\u2019s book the character toys with a shawl, to see if it lends her authority, but the hairpiece felt right to King. \u201cIt was more reflective of the women of that era,\u201d she says. \u201cMy grandmother certainly had one wig that she wore when she went to handle business and another if she was going out for dinner. And sometimes she just wore her own hair. They were different aspects of character. It\u2019s something like what we do as actors, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>King grew up in the 1970s outside Los Angeles. Her mother, with whom she lived after her parents divorced when she was eight, was a special needs teacher. \u201cMy mom encouraged us to listen to what our spirits were saying inside and nurture that,\u201d she says. \u201cMe and my sister [Reina, also an actor] took every class. And Mom took us to see things. If the Dance Theatre of Harlem was playing LA or if Eartha Kitt was in town we would be there. My mum wanted to have us always work that muscle in between our ears.\u201d</p> <p>King was at college studying communications when she got her first TV role in the long-running sitcom <em>227</em>. She learned alongside the black American actor Marla Gibbs, now 87. Gibbs was one of the people King had in mind when she wrote, in 2010, an outraged open letter to the organisers of the Emmy awards, which detonated the debate about the ongoing \u201cwhiteness\u201d of such ceremonies. The immediate occasion was a wrongly captioned photograph that confused her with Rutina Wesley, another actor who attended that year\u2019s ceremony, but the statistics she discovered came as a shock even to her. Of more than 1,000 nominations in four main categories in the history of the awards, only 53 had gone to non-white actors. \u201cI try hard in my daily life not to engage in uncomfortable situations regarding race,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut sometimes it\u2019s very difficult to find other reasons that better explain why certain events play out the way they do.\u201d</p> <p>Looking back on that now she suggests it was written mostly out of accumulated frustration. \u201cPartly just that sense: look, I\u2019m many things in addition to being black.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16acde196aac526e6fa2b99382b2263d96e831f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16acde196aac526e6fa2b99382b2263d96e831f8/0_288_3629_2178/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Regina King celebrates her win for American Crime at the 2016 Emmy awards.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Regina King celebrates her win for American Crime at the 2016 Emmy awards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does it feel that things have changed since then?</p> <p>\u201cWell I guess, but slowly. It will be a significant change when we see black women in roles more often not just because they are black. I wouldn\u2019t put a time frame on that. Here we are with a screen adaptation of a story written 45 years ago, and in important aspects not much has changed.

This young man in the film comes from love, as many men in this position do.\u201d</p> <p>When she made <em>Seven Seconds</em>, King spoke of the way she channelled fears she had felt for her own teenage son. I ask if those fears have been emphasised with the current political moment.</p> <p>\u201cI never thought that someone like Donald Trump could become president,\u201d she says. \u201cBut while the country feels very divided right now I also think there are a lot of Americans who have come together, who might not have come together otherwise.

      "bodyText": "In all the heat and light of prediction surrounding this year\u2019s Oscar shortlists, one category appears easier to call than most. Regina King has long been an odds-on favourite as best supporting actress for her role in the adaptation of James Baldwin\u2019s novel If Beale Street Could Talk. At 48, King is having something of a repetitive red carpet moment. Of the dozen nominations she has received for her performance from different award ceremonies, she has so far come out on top in 11, including the Golden Globes. When I spoke to her on the phone in Los Angeles, she was inevitably in the midst of hair and makeup for another round of accolades that evening. \u201cI have never really been a part of this thing called awards season,\u201d she said, with a low laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s like a new full-time job. I\u2019m not complaining \u2013 just stating!\u201d The proper recognition of King\u2019s screen presence is stupidly overdue. Since her movie debut in John Singleton\u2019s Boyz n the Hood she has made a speciality of providing the emotional scaffolding of numerous films and TV series, the superstructure on which other, flashier talents can rely. The pattern was set in Jerry Maguire, where King played the kickass wife of a self-destructive American football star, and delivered a true beating heart to set against the hyperactive bromance between Cuba Gooding Jr and Tom Cruise. She has in the past decade graduated to pivotal roles in the garlanded TV series American Crime, and as the Emmy award-winning star in last year\u2019s Seven Seconds in which she played, with ravaged grace, a mother fighting for Black Lives Matter justice for a son killed by a white police officer in a car accident. All of that intensity is brought to bear in If Beale Street Could Talk, the film that director Barry Jenkins chose to follow the triumph of Moonlight. From the moment we are introduced to King in the movie \u2013 in the kitchen of a 1970s Harlem apartment while her young daughter prepares to break the news that she is expecting the baby of her boyfriend, who is wrongfully in prison \u2013 we know that we are in the safest of hands. King locates every quiet nuance of human drama in those pregnant pauses. Her eventual response, shaping the news within the family, is not only one of the most beautifully constructed scenes among this year\u2019s Oscar films but also a kind of exemplar of compassionate motherhood. King\u2019s performance is all about love. She was contacted about the role while she was directing an episode of the TV comedy This Is Us, one of several recent ventures behind the camera. \u201cI opened the email and read James Baldwin, Barry Jenkins,\u201d she recalls. \u201cSo it didn\u2019t take much twisting my arm. It was a \u2018you had me at hello\u2019 moment.\u201d As soon as she read Jenkins\u2019s script and Baldwin\u2019s book, she knew exactly the woman she was playing.

The EU\u2019s 3% annual deficit limit was safe, but the rule preventing member states from increasing already high debt-to-GDP levels was going to be contravened.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/19/italy-avoids-eu-sanctions-after-reaching-2019-budget-agreement\" title=\"\">A compromise was reached</a> once the EU accepted forecasts for 2019 that showed Italian GDP increasing by an optimistic 1%.

      "bodyText": "Sharing his predictions on the economy less than a month ago, Luigi Di Maio, the Italian deputy prime minister, believed the country was on the cusp of an economic miracle akin to the one enjoyed in the 1960s. \u201cDuring that period we built highways, now we can build digital highways,\u201d he enthused. His comments were met with derisive laughter. There was even less to laugh about on Thursday when figures revealed that Italy, which is saddled with a public debt of about 130% of GDP, had lurched back into recession for the third time in a decade. Fabio Franceschi, owner of Grafica Veneta, Italy\u2019s largest printing house, is among the many businesspeople in despair. \u201cThe country is in the hands of a couple of kids,\u201d he told the Observer, referring to Di Maio and his co-deputy, Matteo Salvini. Far from being on the verge of a boom, Italy is at a \u201ctipping point\u201d, he added. \u201cWe hope they become conscious [of the situation], as things are becoming really difficult.\u201d Franceschi said the decline was partly due to the uncertainty being created by a government whose 2019 budget contains little in the way of spurring investment, and which has made blocking migrants at Italian ports, spats with France and campaigning ahead of the European elections in May its priorities. \u201cWith all of this \u2026 we are becoming an uncivil country. There is no focus on business and job creation. As for the rowing with France \u2013 we should never compare ourselves to other countries. France has a credibility that we don\u2019t have at this moment.\u201d It\u2019s a view shared by most economists, many of whom cite Italy as the most likely spark for the next eurozone crisis. Officials in Rome can only look back over the past 10 years with sadness. Italian GDP is about 5% below where it stood in 2008 and unemployment, which hovered around 6% before the financial crisis, remains stubbornly at just over 10%. Poverty levels are up and there is little extra money in the kitty to invest for the future without increasing the country\u2019s enormous debts. A budget forged by the coalition of Salvini\u2019s League party and Di Maio\u2019s Five Star Movement (M5S) was agreed in December after months of battling with the European commission. At issue was the debt mountain and how the coalition planned to increase it in breach of EU rules. The EU\u2019s 3% annual deficit limit was safe, but the rule preventing member states from increasing already high debt-to-GDP levels was going to be contravened. A compromise was reached once the EU accepted forecasts for 2019 that showed Italian GDP increasing by an optimistic 1%. With the economy now in recession as it enters the new year and GDP growth flat at best, the prospects for maintaining Italy\u2019s debt mountain at 130% of GDP are slim. Lorenzo Codogno, a former chief economist at the Italian finance ministry, believes the budget has set Rome on course for another crisis. \u201cAll the leading indicators suggest the first quarter of the year will be as bad as the last, and the second quarter will be flat. It\u2019s likely things will pick up from there, but even then, it will mean the economy finishes the year in a weak position,\u201d he says. Salvini and Di Maio have put increases in pension entitlements and plans to introduce a basic income high on their agenda, along with taxes on banks and cuts to business tax reliefs. Codogno, who is a visiting professor at the London School of Economics and runs his own London-based consultancy, said cuts to public investment and a mix of extra taxes and benefit giveaways fail to address long-standing barriers to growth, storing up problems that could prove ruinous in a year\u2019s time. \u201cThe coalition is clearly anti-bank and anti-business. It doesn\u2019t help businesses increase investment if they must pay more in tax. Extra taxes on banks could lead to a liquidity crisis \u2013 maybe not now but next year, possibly. \u201cAnd the extra money given to pensioners and through the basic income increases the structural deficit, and that will be difficult to reverse if the government gets into financial difficulties,\u201d he added. While he recognises the awkward situation Italy finds itself in, the finance minister, Giovanni Tria, put an optimistic gloss on the country\u2019s prospects in a speech to Columbia University students on Thursday. The former academic, who argued for tighter budget control before giving way to Salvini, Di Maio and the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said that Italy\u2019s competitive export sector was behind the sizeable current account surplus of about 2.5% of GDP, \u201cin spite of persistent overvaluation of the exchange rate and the negative effects of the [financial] crisis\u201d. He also said that Italian household finances were in a stronger position than most other European countries, with private wealth estimated at more than twice the national debt. That national debt, despite being among the largest in the world, is held mostly by domestic investors. In essence, just like the Japanese, Italians would rather lend their government money than pay enough taxes for it to function. Tria did not address the issue of tax in his speech. He preferred to blame the Germans. He said Berlin\u2019s emphasis on trade with China and the far east had denied the rest of the eurozone the support it needs from German business. \u201cThe model pursued by the German export-led growth appears to be at the root of the lack of convergence and the loss of dynamism across the European regions,\u201d he said. In essence, Tria was saying that only when the Germans buy Italian, Spanish and French industrial products can the eurozone\u2019s heavy industries and tech companies generate enough profits to reinvest in their businesses and become more productive. Tria is not the only one playing the blame game. Conte has pointed to global trade tensions and their negative trickle-down effects on Italy\u2019s exports as causing the country\u2019s first recession since 2013. He said even \u201cthe most naive analysts\u201d were aware of the dampening effects on exports of the tariff dispute between Washington and Beijing. Salvini went as far as to blame the bridge collapse in Genoa on the EU\u2019s tough line on the budget, saying: \u201cSpending that saves lives, jobs and the right to health must not be part of rigid calculations and of rules imposed by Europe.\u201d Responding to the salvo, the EU budget commissioner, G\u00fcnther Oettinger, tweeted: \u201cIt is very human to look for somebody to blame, when [a] terrible accident happens \u2026 still, good to look at facts.\u201d Codogno said there were probably enough funds in the public investment budget to improve infrastructure without a further boost. \u201cItaly has other issues than just the budget. A public procurement code brought in by the previous government \u2013 one that is designed to tackle corruption \u2013 has actually made public officials more cautious. It means that funds already allocated are not being spent.\u201d There was a time when the Italian coalition partners heaped most opprobrium on the euro, echoing comments by Tria that Italy had battled vainly against a high exchange rate.

She had fled the Islamist group\u2019s previous bloody assaults on Baga and was suspicious of the militants\u2019 reassurances, convinced they would end up killing innocent civilians. So she fled, along with about 30,000 others. With Maryam on her back, Muhafat in her arms and Mohammed given to a friend to carry, she walked through the thorny Sahelian scrub for two days and nights to reach safety.</p> <p>Late last month, Nigeria\u2019s president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/muhammadu-buhari\" title=\"\">Muhammadu Buhari</a>, told a crowd of supporters he had been assured that Boko Haram, which has waged a 10-year insurgency in the country\u2019s north-east, had been \u201cfully decimated\u201d.

A general, and former military dictator, he appeared to have the experience and severity to deal decisively with the militants responsible for kidnapping hundreds of schoolchildren, strapping bombs to little girls and killing tens of thousands of innocent Nigerians.</p> <p>Over the past four years, however, Nigeria\u2019s security problems have multiplied. Thousands have died in clashes between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jan/03/drought-worsens-deadly-conflict-between-fulani-herdsmen-nigeria-farmers\" title=\"\">herdsmen and farmers</a> that have destabilised six states and which some are calling the \u201cgreatest threat to Nigeria\u2019s peace and security\u201d. There is a resurgent militancy in the oil-rich <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/26/niger-delta-avengers-militants-shut-down-chevron-oil-facility\" title=\"\">Niger Delta</a>, a strengthened <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/24/nigeria-army-denies-killing-150-at-biafra-demonstrations\" title=\"\">separatist Biafra movement</a> in the east, while hundreds are being killed in unexplained raids in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/03/cattle-rustlers-kill-northern-nigeria-zamfara-vigilante\" title=\"\">Zamfara</a> in the north-west. And, contrary to the triumphant rhetoric of Buhari and his officials, the attacks in the north-east remain constant, particularly in the worst-affected state of Borno. In fact, they have surged in the past six weeks.</p> <p>The assault on Baga was part of a six-month pattern of escalating attacks, according to military sources, who contradict Buhari\u2019s claims of \u201cdecimation\u201d. Soon after that attack, Boko Haram \u2013 whether Iswap or another faction is unclear \u2013 hit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jan/17/thousands-flee-north-east-nigeria-after-devastating-boko-haram-attack-rann-cameroon-bodo\" title=\"\">Rann</a>, a garrison town to the south-east. More than 9,000 people fled over the border to Cameroon, where they were forced back; then, last week, after the military pulled out of Rann, 30,000 fled again.Letting civilians leave unharmed may not seem Boko Haram\u2019s style but until recently it has been a feature of Iswap, which split from the group led by Abubakar Shekauin 2016 and had its pledge of allegiance accepted by Isis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the first attacks we lost everything. Now it\u2019s happened  again... we are not going back, that\u2019s the end</p> <footer> <cite>Refugee Zara Abubakar</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ostensibly led by Abu Musab al-Barnawi, the son of Boko Haram\u2019s late founder Mohammed Yusuf, the real power in Iswap is thought to have rested with Mamman Nur, a former Yusuf crony.</p> <p>But last year Nur was reportedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/14/senior-boko-haram-figure-reportedly-killed-by-allies\" title=\"\">executed by his own men</a> in a dispute over the mass kidnap of a second batch of schoolgirls, and since then the group appears to have resumed killing Muslim civilians \u2013 notoriously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/16/nigeria-islamist-militants-kill-aid-worker-red-cross-after-deadline-expires\" title=\"\">murdering two Red Cross midwives</a> late last year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the military has stuck to a strategy of creating and defending garrison towns across Borno. These are militarised islands in a sea of insecurity, containing thousands of civilians who have been lured or pushed back \u201chome\u201d with promises of a return to normal life, but then find themselves living in dire conditions in camps, relying on aid because, surrounded by trenches, checkpoints and militant threat, they cannot leave to fish and farm.</p> <p>Iswap regularly launches attacks on these towns and the military bases near them, and the army struggles to repel them. Suffering high casualties, with low morale and inadequate equipment \u2013 it is unclear how the $1bn Buhari took from the country\u2019s Excess Crude Account in late 2017 to fight Boko Haram was spent \u2013 the army is also pulled in several directions. The north-east is not the only front it is fighting on. Checkpoints dot the roads of Nigeria\u2019s middle-belt states, ostensibly to prevent raids by Fulani herdsmen on mostly Christian farmers\u2019 villages and vice versa. However, people on all sides say the military backs whichever community pays it, and accuse local politicians of arming their favoured side.</p> <p>The highly politicised herder-farmer conflict is geographically Nigeria\u2019s most widespread crisis \u2013 it has spread far south of the middle-belt states, and is escalating fast. Many Nigerians, particularly in the south, think Buhari, their ethnically Fulani president, has turned a blind eye to his marauding kinsmen, and feel vindicated by a 2015 Global Terrorism Index report controversially labelling them a \u201cterrorist\u201d group. According to the Fulani, the mostly Christian-owned media reports far more \u201cnefarious acts\u201d perpetrated than suffered by them.</p> <p>It remains unclear how the Nigerian government plans to hold safe elections in this atmosphere, or in the north-western state of Zamfara, and in the north-east, where around 800,000 people are in \u201cinaccessible areas\u201d \u2013 the countryside around the garrison towns, where Boko Haram roams and humanitarian organisations cannot reach.</p> <p>Several weeks after the Baga attack, Abubakar remains in a camp for internally displaced people. She is recovering from the trauma of her journey \u2013 she reached Monguno and then Maiduguri, where she, her children and her friend slept in the open with no food or water until they were taken to the camp. She is struggling to afford enough milk to feed the triplets.</p> <p>It is unlikely the government will ever be able to persuade them it is safe to return to Baga.</p> <p>\u201cWe lost everything in those first and second attacks on Baga and had to start again, and now it has happened again when we were trying to pick up the pieces of our lives,\u201d said Abubakar. \u201cWe are not going back to Baga again, that\u2019s the end of everything to do with that town.\u201d</p> <h2>Election rivals</h2> <p>The Nigerian election will see incumbent Muhammadu Buhari face 72-year-old Atiku Abubakar, a former vice-president and businessman who has long had the presidency in his sights.</p> <p>Preparations for massive vote-rigging are rumoured to be afoot, and last month Buhari, 76, summarily and unconstitutionally suspended the country\u2019s chief justice Walter Onnoghen, something that has prompted outcry from Nigerians and from the UK and US, as the head of the judiciary is key in settling election disputes. The 2015 election in which Buhari came to power was widely considered free and fair, but Nigeria has a long history of electoral violence and vote-rigging.</p> <p>Battling rumours that he is not the real Buhari but a body double from Sudan, the president has promised to keep on with his agenda of tackling corruption and insecurity while trying to boost a struggling economy. Atiku, as his opponent is popularly known, is promising to create jobs and slash poverty.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Boko Haram stormed into Baga in a hail of gunfire on Boxing Day, Zara Abubakar was lying in bed, waiting for her two-week-old triplets, Maryam, Muhafat and Mohammed, to go to sleep so she could have a bath. Heart pounding, she shouted for her four other children playing in the yard to come in, covering the babies with her body. For hours they all lay inside, waiting for the battle to let up. Then there was silence, followed by shouts of Allahu Akbar, and Baga mosque\u2019s loudspeakers crackled into life. \u201cBoko Haram made an announcement that they were not here for us but for the infidels [the military] and that they were now in charge,\u201d Abubakar recounted, jogging one of the triplets in the crook of her elbow and another on her knee. It was a faction of Boko Haram called Islamic State West Africa Province (Iswap), which is allied with Isis. \u201cThey advised everyone in the town to be calm, adding that whoever wanted to stay could do so and anyone not willing to remain would be free to leave,\u201d she said. It was not the first time that Abubakar had encountered Boko Haram. She had fled the Islamist group\u2019s previous bloody assaults on Baga and was suspicious of the militants\u2019 reassurances, convinced they would end up killing innocent civilians. So she fled, along with about 30,000 others. With Maryam on her back, Muhafat in her arms and Mohammed given to a friend to carry, she walked through the thorny Sahelian scrub for two days and nights to reach safety. Late last month, Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari, told a crowd of supporters he had been assured that Boko Haram, which has waged a 10-year insurgency in the country\u2019s north-east, had been \u201cfully decimated\u201d. With a general election on 16 February, Buhari is making the supposed defeat of Boko Haram an important piece of his political strategy on the campaign trail. When he came to power in 2015, Buhari\u2019s decisive victory rested mainly on twin promises \u2013 to fight the rampant corruption of the previous administration, and to restore security. A general, and former military dictator, he appeared to have the experience and severity to deal decisively with the militants responsible for kidnapping hundreds of schoolchildren, strapping bombs to little girls and killing tens of thousands of innocent Nigerians. Over the past four years, however, Nigeria\u2019s security problems have multiplied. Thousands have died in clashes between herdsmen and farmers that have destabilised six states and which some are calling the \u201cgreatest threat to Nigeria\u2019s peace and security\u201d. There is a resurgent militancy in the oil-rich Niger Delta, a strengthened separatist Biafra movement in the east, while hundreds are being killed in unexplained raids in Zamfara in the north-west. And, contrary to the triumphant rhetoric of Buhari and his officials, the attacks in the north-east remain constant, particularly in the worst-affected state of Borno. In fact, they have surged in the past six weeks. The assault on Baga was part of a six-month pattern of escalating attacks, according to military sources, who contradict Buhari\u2019s claims of \u201cdecimation\u201d. Soon after that attack, Boko Haram \u2013 whether Iswap or another faction is unclear \u2013 hit Rann, a garrison town to the south-east. More than 9,000 people fled over the border to Cameroon, where they were forced back; then, last week, after the military pulled out of Rann, 30,000 fled again.Letting civilians leave unharmed may not seem Boko Haram\u2019s style but until recently it has been a feature of Iswap, which split from the group led by Abubakar Shekauin 2016 and had its pledge of allegiance accepted by Isis. Ostensibly led by Abu Musab al-Barnawi, the son of Boko Haram\u2019s late founder Mohammed Yusuf, the real power in Iswap is thought to have rested with Mamman Nur, a former Yusuf crony. But last year Nur was reportedly executed by his own men in a dispute over the mass kidnap of a second batch of schoolgirls, and since then the group appears to have resumed killing Muslim civilians \u2013 notoriously murdering two Red Cross midwives late last year. Meanwhile, the military has stuck to a strategy of creating and defending garrison towns across Borno. These are militarised islands in a sea of insecurity, containing thousands of civilians who have been lured or pushed back \u201chome\u201d with promises of a return to normal life, but then find themselves living in dire conditions in camps, relying on aid because, surrounded by trenches, checkpoints and militant threat, they cannot leave to fish and farm. Iswap regularly launches attacks on these towns and the military bases near them, and the army struggles to repel them. Suffering high casualties, with low morale and inadequate equipment \u2013 it is unclear how the $1bn Buhari took from the country\u2019s Excess Crude Account in late 2017 to fight Boko Haram was spent \u2013 the army is also pulled in several directions. The north-east is not the only front it is fighting on. Checkpoints dot the roads of Nigeria\u2019s middle-belt states, ostensibly to prevent raids by Fulani herdsmen on mostly Christian farmers\u2019 villages and vice versa. However, people on all sides say the military backs whichever community pays it, and accuse local politicians of arming their favoured side. The highly politicised herder-farmer conflict is geographically Nigeria\u2019s most widespread crisis \u2013 it has spread far south of the middle-belt states, and is escalating fast. Many Nigerians, particularly in the south, think Buhari, their ethnically Fulani president, has turned a blind eye to his marauding kinsmen, and feel vindicated by a 2015 Global Terrorism Index report controversially labelling them a \u201cterrorist\u201d group. According to the Fulani, the mostly Christian-owned media reports far more \u201cnefarious acts\u201d perpetrated than suffered by them. It remains unclear how the Nigerian government plans to hold safe elections in this atmosphere, or in the north-western state of Zamfara, and in the north-east, where around 800,000 people are in \u201cinaccessible areas\u201d \u2013 the countryside around the garrison towns, where Boko Haram roams and humanitarian organisations cannot reach. Several weeks after the Baga attack, Abubakar remains in a camp for internally displaced people. She is recovering from the trauma of her journey \u2013 she reached Monguno and then Maiduguri, where she, her children and her friend slept in the open with no food or water until they were taken to the camp. She is struggling to afford enough milk to feed the triplets. It is unlikely the government will ever be able to persuade them it is safe to return to Baga. \u201cWe lost everything in those first and second attacks on Baga and had to start again, and now it has happened again when we were trying to pick up the pieces of our lives,\u201d said Abubakar. \u201cWe are not going back to Baga again, that\u2019s the end of everything to do with that town.\u201d Election rivals The Nigerian election will see incumbent Muhammadu Buhari face 72-year-old Atiku Abubakar, a former vice-president and businessman who has long had the presidency in his sights. Preparations for massive vote-rigging are rumoured to be afoot, and last month Buhari, 76, summarily and unconstitutionally suspended the country\u2019s chief justice Walter Onnoghen, something that has prompted outcry from Nigerians and from the UK and US, as the head of the judiciary is key in settling election disputes. The 2015 election in which Buhari came to power was widely considered free and fair, but Nigeria has a long history of electoral violence and vote-rigging. Battling rumours that he is not the real Buhari but a body double from Sudan, the president has promised to keep on with his agenda of tackling corruption and insecurity while trying to boost a struggling economy. Atiku, as his opponent is popularly known, is promising to create jobs and slash poverty.",

While official figures are yet to be published, analysts believe the eurozone\u2019s largest economy probably contracted for the second quarter in a row in the final three months of 2018 \u2013 enough for a technical recession. Jobs growth has, however, remained strong. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates the economy expanded by 1.5% last year, while growth will slow to 1.3% in 2019.</p> <h2>France</h2> <p>The country\u2019s economy ended 2018 on a stronger footing than expected, despite the headwinds from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/03/who-are-the-gilets-jaunes-and-what-do-they-want\" title=\"\"><em>gilets jaunes</em></a> anti-government protests, first started as a backlash against plans to raise fuel taxes. Rising export volumes offset sluggish household consumption in the final quarter of the year. GDP rose by 0.3% in the three months to December, contributing to annual growth of 1.5%.

Despite this, unemployment is the lowest since the mid-1970s and wage growth has accelerated to the highest level in a decade. After robust growth in the summer, GDP growth is expected to ease to about 0.3% in the fourth quarter as mounting Brexit fears act as a drag on activity. The IMF forecasts GDP growth of 1.4% in 2018 and 1.5% should Brexit pass smoothly.

The page includes the following quote: \u201cThere are more old drunks than old doctors in this world so I think I\u2019ll have another beer.\u201d Northam, 59, was elected in 2017, having served as lieutenant governor. He also served in the US army, attended Eastern Virginia Medical School and worked as a pediatric neurologist. His admission that he was one of the figures in the photograph drew immediate calls for his resignation from across the political spectrum. \u201cLeaders are called to a higher standard, and the stain of racism should have no place in the halls of government,\u201d tweeted the California senator Harris, a leading contender for the Democratic nomination for president. \u201cThe governor of Virginia should step aside so the public can heal and move forward together.\u201d Booker, the New Jersey senator who, like Harris, is African American, tweeted: \u201cThese images arouse centuries of anger, anguish, and racist violence and they\u2019ve eroded all confidence in Gov[ernor] Northam\u2019s ability to lead. We should expect more from our elected officials. He should resign.\u201d Other Democratic presidential hopefuls, senators Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand and the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, called on Northam to go, as did leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, MoveOn, the pro-choice group Naral and the Priorities USA Super Pac. The Virginia Legislative Black Caucus (VLBC), state House Democratic Caucus and state Senate Democratic Caucus said Northam should go. Virginia\u2019s two Democratic US senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, condemned the picture but did not immediately call for Northam\u2019s resignation. A Democratic predecessor as governor, Terry McAuliffe, said \u201cthis has been a heartbreaking day\u201d and praised Northam as a friend. But he added: \u201cHis actions on display in this photo were racist, unacceptable and inexcusable at any age and any time. The situation that he has put himself and the Commonwealth of Virginia in is untenable. It\u2019s time for Ralph to step down, and for the Commonwealth to move forward.\u201d The Republican party of Virginia tweeted: \u201cWhat Ralph Northam did was unforgivable. Given his statements on the right to life coupled with the most recent revelations, he has lost the moral authority to continue to govern and should resign immediately.\u201d The only black Republican US senator, Tim Scott of South Carolina, wrote: \u201cWhile a quick apology is good, it does not excuse the choices made by [Northam] as an adult enrolled in medical school.\u201d Scott said he hoped \u201cthe people of Virginia will make their voices heard; I hope they will shout far [and] wide that there are consequences for such showcases of prejudice [and] hate\u201d. Black lawmakers said they met Northam on Friday and appreciated his service. \u201cBut given what was revealed today, it is clear he can no longer effectively serve as governor,\u201d the VLBC said. \u201cIt is time for him to resign, so that Virginia can begin the process of healing.\u201d Later on Friday, Northam issued a video. \u201cI cannot change the decisions I made, nor can I undo the harm my behavior caused then and today,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I accept responsibility for my past actions, and I am ready to do the hard work of regaining your trust \u2026 I am committed to continuing that fight through the remainder of my term.\u201d The state senator Louise Lucas, an ally of Northam, was unmoved, telling the Associated Press black leaders felt \u201cmortally wounded\u201d and the governor should go. \u201cHe betrayed us,\u201d she said. Virginia has been grappling with its legacy of slavery and Jim Crow. Approximately 50 members of the Klan rallied in Charlottesville in July 2017 over plans to remove a statue of Confederate general Robert E Lee from a city park. The next month, a gathering of hundreds of white nationalists in the city turned deadly. Northam was elected that November, a win seen by many as a rebuke of Donald Trump and Republican support of Confederate \u201cheritage\u201d. Should Northam resign, he would be succeeded by his lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, the second African American elected to statewide office in Virginia. Last month, the Washington Post reported on a small act of protest by Fairfax, who declined to participate in a state senate tribute to Lee. On Saturday, Biden wrote: \u201cThere is no place for racism in America. Governor Northam has lost all moral authority and should resign immediately, Justin Fairfax is the leader Virginia needs now.\u201d Sanders agreed. The lieutenant governor, he said, should \u201cstep in and begin a new day for Virginia\u201d.",

He\u2019s up for best supporting actor for the excellent <em>Can You Ever Forgive Me?</em> and, along with Melissa McCarthy, is drawing more attention to a film that genuinely deserves it.

The startling realisation was that there is a repeating pattern \u2013 a periodicity \u2013 in the properties of the elements, such as how they react with each other. (We know now that fundamentally this comes down to how the electrons in an atom, which determine how it behaves, fit into successive shells around the nucleus.) The known elements can be laid out into rows and columns, with those lining up in the same column sharing characteristics, like a chemical family. Neon, argon and xenon, for example, all have similar properties: they are the noble gases and are exceedingly reluctant to be cajoled into any reactions. And when electricity is passed through a tubeful, they emit garish colours; the lights that became synonymous with Las Vegas and other urban centres.</p> <p>Mendeleev\u2019s flash of insight (he later claimed to have seen his whole grand construct in a dream) also allowed him to infer the existence of as yet undiscovered elements \u2013 holes in the brickwork of known elements \u2013 and even to predict their properties. He postulated that \u201cekaaluminium\u201d must exist in the gap in his table immediately below aluminium; we now know this as gallium, and his forecasts on its properties were spot on.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you own a smartphone, you have in your pocket a substantial fraction of all the stable elements in the periodic table</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mendeleev had only 61 known elements at the time to sort, but by the early years of the 20th century we had identified 85 of these fundamental building blocks of the universe, all falling neatly into place in the framework.</p> <p>These are all naturally occurring elements, and chemists were able to discover and isolate them by studying a wide variety of different minerals from around the world, like elemental prospectors hunting out new finds. But since the mid-1930s chemists have learned to control nuclear reactions to generate their own elements (in effect, achieving transmutation and the dreams of the alchemists). So far, 24 elements have been artificially crafted; extending the bottom row of the periodic table with new creations. These elements do not exist naturally on Earth \u2013 their atomic nuclei are so swollen and unstable that they rapidly undergo radioactive decay or nuclear fission to break down again to other elements. So today, chemistry has progressed beyond merely mapping out the natural landscape of the periodic table to actually adding to it, like Holland\u2019s land reclamation projects.

Our repertoire has begun to diversify over the past century or so, with the widespread use of aluminium and other new metals. But in the past few decades the number of different metals we wield in our technological society has absolutely exploded. A modern smartphone contains more than 30 different elements. These include carbon and hydrogen in the plastic casing, silicon for the microchip wafers, and copper wiring and gold contacts. But there are also small amounts of a large number of other metals, each exploited for its own particular electronic properties, or for the tiny, powerful magnets used in the speaker and vibration motor. This means that if you own a smartphone, you have in your pocket a substantial fraction of all the stable elements of the periodic table. And it\u2019s not just modern electronics that demand a huge diversity of different metals. So too do the high-performance alloys used in the turbines of a power station or aircraft jet engine, or the reaction-accelerating catalysts that we use in industrial chemistry for refining oil, producing plastics or synthesising modern medicinal drugs. Yet most of us have never even heard of many of these critical metals \u2013 elements with exotic names like tantalum, yttrium or dysprosium.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d30fb06ce70b89779f456af537b26e790cd9b99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d30fb06ce70b89779f456af537b26e790cd9b99/0_12_1970_1182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"possibly the worlds oldest periodic table at the university of st andrews\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Early days: possibly the world\u2019s oldest extant copy of Mendeleev\u2019s periodic table, found during a clearout at the University of St Andrews in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: University of St Andrews/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The concern is that unlike widespread resources like iron or nitrogen, several of these elements crucial to the modern world may become prohibitively scarce.

Helium is very useful \u2013 as a cooling liquid for the superconducting magnets in hospital MRI scanners, for example, or as an extremely light gas for weather balloons and airships.

Gallium, for example, is needed for integrated circuits, solar panels, blue LEDs and laser diodes for Blu-ray Discs.

This means that they can\u2019t be extracted economically in many areas of the world. And once they have been manufactured as tiny components within an electronic device, they can be even harder to reclaim and recycle.

      "body": "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/diana-vreeland\" title=\"\">Diana Vreeland</a> arrived in Paris from the US in 1946, she could scarcely believe her eyes. Oh, my dears! The bread was made with potato flour, even the young looked as if they hadn\u2019t seen daylight in years, and absolutely <em>everyone</em> was wearing wooden shoes. Vreeland, who would go on to edit American<em> Vogue</em>, is famous for her description of the bikini as \u201cthe most important thing since the atom bomb\u201d, a typically immoderate pronouncement of the same year. By the time she came to compile her memoirs four decades later, however, she\u2019d somewhat revised this opinion. \u201cI suppose bikinis started <em>during</em> the war,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey probably just tore bedsheets apart and made them.\u201d</p> <p>Overstatement was Vreeland\u2019s stock-in-trade. So, too, was a certain kind of shudder. Nevertheless, it\u2019s all but impossible to understand the impact of Christian Dior\u2019s New Look, launched by the designer on an unsuspecting world in 1947, without considering the privations of the war. For years, women had had to make do, going without not only new clothes but nylons and lipstick as well: a miserable drabness that would continue long after the final all-clear sounded (in Britain, clothes rationing didn\u2019t end until 1949). Nothing could be wasted, not even one\u2019s blackout curtains. Dior, though, was having none of this, for which reason one can only imagine how women must have felt on catching sight of his luxuriant designs on some newsreel. Those huge skirts! They were gorgeous. But perhaps a greater part of the excitement they stirred came from the sense that they were also highly transgressive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"51dc15ad2ebf7b6a595507eb8aeb0ca31909ae89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51dc15ad2ebf7b6a595507eb8aeb0ca31909ae89/151_162_1254_1898/661.jpg\" alt=\"Bar Suit, haute couture, spring/summer 1947 by Christian Dior.\" width=\"661\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bar Suit, haute couture, spring/summer 1947 by Christian Dior.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laziz Hamani/V&amp;A, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The V&amp;A\u2019s exhibition <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/dior-designer-of-dreams\" title=\"\">Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams</a>, a reimagined version of a show staged by the <a href=\"https://madparis.fr/en\" title=\"\">Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs</a> in Paris, comes with several striking omissions. The need to maintain the support of LVMH, the conglomerate that now owns the house, is presumably behind its failure to explain, for instance, the precise nature of the \u201ccontroversy\u201d that saw John Galliano <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/01/john-galliano-sacked-by-christian-dior\" title=\"\">leave the label</a> in 2011 (he was dismissed following an antisemitic outburst). But among the strangest is surely this: its failure to set the scene. The exhibition opens with a single design, Dior\u2019s Bar Suit from 1947: an ivory shantung jacket and a black wool skirt that has come to stand as an emblem of the New Look. Gaze at that nipped-in waist, and gasp! But though the date is carefully noted, we\u2019re told almost nothing about the times.</p> <p>Looking around, I found a photograph of Dior trying hard to ignore a demonstration held by women in Chicago later that year. \u201cWe abhor dresses to the floor!\u201d announce their placards. Were they protesting against his wastefulness? Or were they anxious about what these darned impractical gowns symbolised? (Some believed the New Look was another way of pushing women back into the home following a war that had, for all its ills, proved to be something of a liberation.) No explanation is forthcoming. The show, staged in the museum\u2019s spacious new Sainsbury Gallery, exists in a bubble: we hear of many triumphs but never of any failures or even missteps, something that strikes me as a neglect of duty on the V&amp;A\u2019s part. If you\u2019re going to say that fashion is art, then it must be as open to interpretation and criticism as any other form; it cannot come only with blandishments and air kisses.</p> <p>Dior was born in Normandy in 1905, the son of a wealthy industrialist; it was his parents who bankrolled his first venture, a Paris gallery, even if they would not allow him to put the family name above the door. In 1931, however, his mother died and his father lost all his money, at which point the feeling that Christian\u2019s artistic leanings were not quite the thing (they\u2019d hoped for a diplomat) ceased to matter. Having retrained as a fashion illustrator, he worked as a designer, first for Robert Piguet and then for Lucien Lelong. Finally, in 1946, he established his own house at 30 Avenue Montaigne, with three ateliers and a staff of 85. Ten years later, he had 28 ateliers and 1,000 staff, not to mention a perfume collection and a pale-faced assistant who went by the name of Yves St Laurent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87a824ba414a97a3e84bae0b5685e508fff5938a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87a824ba414a97a3e84bae0b5685e508fff5938a/0_0_2648_3761/704.jpg\" alt=\"Christian Dior with model Sylvie, c1948.\" width=\"704\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A consummate professional\u2019: Christian Dior with model Sylvie, c1948.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Dior</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The V&amp;A\u2019s show is nothing if not replete: you\u2019ve never seen so much silk satin, so many boned bodices and knife-edge pleats. Dior was a consummate professional and he could do it all (though, please, don\u2019t come expecting trousers): the neatest suit (try the one of grey wool worn by Olivia de Havilland when she married in 1955); the most enviable black dress (oh, to own a frock as immaculate as the Nonette from 1950, with its priestly white cotton pique bib); an adorable evening gown (the Sonnet dress of 1952, in plum silk with bows at exactly the spot \u2013 the hips \u2013 where a man might place his hands and whirl you round). You want flowers? Here they are in abundance on a print used for a ready-to-wear frock from 1956, and yet they do not look vulgar; even after too much Pol Roger, you\u2019d never mistake it for a sofa.

      "bodyText": "When Diana Vreeland arrived in Paris from the US in 1946, she could scarcely believe her eyes. Oh, my dears! The bread was made with potato flour, even the young looked as if they hadn\u2019t seen daylight in years, and absolutely everyone was wearing wooden shoes. Vreeland, who would go on to edit American Vogue, is famous for her description of the bikini as \u201cthe most important thing since the atom bomb\u201d, a typically immoderate pronouncement of the same year. By the time she came to compile her memoirs four decades later, however, she\u2019d somewhat revised this opinion. \u201cI suppose bikinis started during the war,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey probably just tore bedsheets apart and made them.\u201d Overstatement was Vreeland\u2019s stock-in-trade. So, too, was a certain kind of shudder. Nevertheless, it\u2019s all but impossible to understand the impact of Christian Dior\u2019s New Look, launched by the designer on an unsuspecting world in 1947, without considering the privations of the war. For years, women had had to make do, going without not only new clothes but nylons and lipstick as well: a miserable drabness that would continue long after the final all-clear sounded (in Britain, clothes rationing didn\u2019t end until 1949). Nothing could be wasted, not even one\u2019s blackout curtains. Dior, though, was having none of this, for which reason one can only imagine how women must have felt on catching sight of his luxuriant designs on some newsreel. Those huge skirts! They were gorgeous. But perhaps a greater part of the excitement they stirred came from the sense that they were also highly transgressive. The V&amp;A\u2019s exhibition Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams, a reimagined version of a show staged by the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs in Paris, comes with several striking omissions. The need to maintain the support of LVMH, the conglomerate that now owns the house, is presumably behind its failure to explain, for instance, the precise nature of the \u201ccontroversy\u201d that saw John Galliano leave the label in 2011 (he was dismissed following an antisemitic outburst). But among the strangest is surely this: its failure to set the scene. The exhibition opens with a single design, Dior\u2019s Bar Suit from 1947: an ivory shantung jacket and a black wool skirt that has come to stand as an emblem of the New Look. Gaze at that nipped-in waist, and gasp! But though the date is carefully noted, we\u2019re told almost nothing about the times. Looking around, I found a photograph of Dior trying hard to ignore a demonstration held by women in Chicago later that year. \u201cWe abhor dresses to the floor!\u201d announce their placards. Were they protesting against his wastefulness? Or were they anxious about what these darned impractical gowns symbolised? (Some believed the New Look was another way of pushing women back into the home following a war that had, for all its ills, proved to be something of a liberation.) No explanation is forthcoming. The show, staged in the museum\u2019s spacious new Sainsbury Gallery, exists in a bubble: we hear of many triumphs but never of any failures or even missteps, something that strikes me as a neglect of duty on the V&amp;A\u2019s part. If you\u2019re going to say that fashion is art, then it must be as open to interpretation and criticism as any other form; it cannot come only with blandishments and air kisses. Dior was born in Normandy in 1905, the son of a wealthy industrialist; it was his parents who bankrolled his first venture, a Paris gallery, even if they would not allow him to put the family name above the door. In 1931, however, his mother died and his father lost all his money, at which point the feeling that Christian\u2019s artistic leanings were not quite the thing (they\u2019d hoped for a diplomat) ceased to matter. Having retrained as a fashion illustrator, he worked as a designer, first for Robert Piguet and then for Lucien Lelong. Finally, in 1946, he established his own house at 30 Avenue Montaigne, with three ateliers and a staff of 85. Ten years later, he had 28 ateliers and 1,000 staff, not to mention a perfume collection and a pale-faced assistant who went by the name of Yves St Laurent. The V&amp;A\u2019s show is nothing if not replete: you\u2019ve never seen so much silk satin, so many boned bodices and knife-edge pleats. Dior was a consummate professional and he could do it all (though, please, don\u2019t come expecting trousers): the neatest suit (try the one of grey wool worn by Olivia de Havilland when she married in 1955); the most enviable black dress (oh, to own a frock as immaculate as the Nonette from 1950, with its priestly white cotton pique bib); an adorable evening gown (the Sonnet dress of 1952, in plum silk with bows at exactly the spot \u2013 the hips \u2013 where a man might place his hands and whirl you round). You want flowers? Here they are in abundance on a print used for a ready-to-wear frock from 1956, and yet they do not look vulgar; even after too much Pol Roger, you\u2019d never mistake it for a sofa. (This dress, incidentally, is in a display whose theme is gardens, where you will also find, on the ceiling, a wonderfully delicate installation of paper flowers by the design studio Wanda Barcelona.) But skill and good taste do not amount to genius, and Dior is no Balenciaga. Whisper it, but there were moments when, even as I lusted over this pocket and that buttonhole, I felt just a tiny bit bored. What marks him out? In the gallery dedicated to designers who have run the house since his death in 1957, I was struck by the smooth brilliance of Marc Bohan, who led the label with quiet aplomb from 1961 until 1989; only a suggestion of the 60s \u2013 in essence, a move away from the waist \u2013 told you that his early work was not by Dior himself.

We\u2019d never heard of festivals before. I wasn\u2019t really a hippy, more like a flower child. It was a way to get high and get laid. My employer, an older photographer, said I couldn\u2019t go, so I quit my job and we drove up. We tried staying in a field but it was sopping wet and full of leeches. Then we found a cottage about half a mile from the stage. The farmer\u2019s wife said we could have it, $5 for the weekend.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a white horse I gave sugar cubes.

Somehow another would come from different direction.</p> <p>\u201cBy the end of the day, I had somehow slid down the hill to the front of the stage. I saw Canned Heat, the Who, Sly and the Family Stone, Jimi Hendrix doing Star Spangled Banner. Truth is, everybody played great. It was one of those moments. I got stoned, I got laid by some stranger, I had a place to stay. We heard them announcing, \u2018Don\u2019t take the acid\u2019, but there were no negative vibes. I swear to you, there was something telling you this was special. Nothing was wrong. They asked people climbing on the scaffolding to come down and they did. It was peaceful and content. Never disgruntled once. It was happy-happy.</p> <p>\u201cThe next week was kind of a comedown. But when I got back, my employer said, \u2018Hey, I wish I could\u2019ve been you.\u2019 And he gave me my job back.\u201d</p>",

I swear to you, there was something telling you this was special. Nothing was wrong. They asked people climbing on the scaffolding to come down and they did. It was peaceful and content. Never disgruntled once. It was happy-happy. \u201cThe next week was kind of a comedown. But when I got back, my employer said, \u2018Hey, I wish I could\u2019ve been you.\u2019 And he gave me my job back.\u201d",

It was a fantastic effort, I am so happy for my players. It showed the talent we have. Son is doing fantastic for us, his performance and the way he believes. Our squad must have massive credit. We were disappointed after the Carabao Cup and FA Cup, it was the worst moment for us. But we were always positive and we fight. We are now in a good position, and in the Champions League too.

But two goals in the last ten minutes stung the Hornets, and in a week which saw both Liverpool and Manchester City drop points, Spurs are suddenly back in the title race!</p> <p><strong>All of a sudden, they\u2019re just two points behind second-placed City, and seven adrift of the leaders Liverpool. </strong>With over a third of the race still to run, that\u2019s far from an insurmountable gap. A first English championship since 1961 is still a live possibility, no matter how much Mauricio Pochettino tries to play it down.</p> <p><strong>They need to keep it going though, with little margin left for error. </strong>And they\u2019ll feel good about their chances of doing so against Newcastle United, having won their last three against the Toon. Late winners in their last two league matches will have added to the belief that this could still be their year, despite those injuries to Dele Alli and Harry Kane.</p> <p><strong>But while Newcastle have struggled this season, things are beginning to look a little rosier for the Magpies.</strong> Two wins on the bounce in the league have taken them away from immediate danger at the bottom, and scalps don\u2019t come any bigger than the champions Manchester City, who were seen off sensationally on Tuesday night. Their new playmaker Miguel Almiron is still waiting for his visa, so won\u2019t be available today, but his mere arrival has given the entire club a boost. They\u2019re priced long for a win today, at 8-1, but they were 14-1 against City and look what happened there.</p> <p><strong>Can either side make it three wins in a row? </strong>Spurs are desperate to keep their title hopes alive; Newcastle want to put extra space between themselves and the dropzone. It\u2019s perfectly poised ... and it\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>12.30pm GMT.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-02T11:22:43.338Z\">at 11.22am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "So that\u2019s your lot! David Hytner was at Wembley; here\u2019s his report. Enjoy! And finally Poch. \u201cIt was a tough game, because after Newcastle beat Manchester City they had momentum and belief. It was a fantastic effort, I am so happy for my players. It showed the talent we have. Son is doing fantastic for us, his performance and the way he believes. Our squad must have massive credit. We were disappointed after the Carabao Cup and FA Cup, it was the worst moment for us. But we were always positive and we fight. We are now in a good position, and in the Champions League too. In football all is possible.\u201d And now Rafa. \u201cWe did well out wide in the first half, we had chances at the beginning of the second half. But they were pushing and pushing, and we had to be better on the ball. The goal we could have avoided. You have to give credit to Son, because it was a good shot, but we could have done better. Tottenham are a very good team, they have some of the best players in England. It was not easy for us. If we work as hard as we did today, we can improve.\u201d Fabian Schar talks. \u201cIt is a big frustration for us. We fought, they had some chances but so did we. We were so close to a point until that unlucky goal. It would have been a big point, so it\u2019s a big disappointment. We knew the longer the game went, they would press because they had to win, and we had some counter attacks. It was good to keep the ball out [by clearing off the line] but we have no point. I think we are on the right way, but we still have to do a lot of work. There are some games coming where we can win, so we have to be focused.\u201d Son speaks! \u201cOf course I am tired, but the two games were very important. And with the six points, I think we have had a great week. It was a difficult game but we are very happy and we deserved this one. We tried to get the goal, but football is not easy and we had to wait. Luckily I had the chance and I\u2019m very grateful for my team-mates. The team-mates and coaching staff give me confidence. I enjoy every second in the Premier League.\u201d A third late winner in a row for Spurs. The sort of run that makes teams think: this could be our season. They\u2019ll be dreaming again, and feeling very good about themselves after a difficult week in the cups. They\u2019re second on 57 points, four behind Liverpool and one clear of Manchester City. We\u2019ve got a real title race on our hands this season, folks! Newcastle meanwhile remain in 14th place, on 24 points. They\u2019re five clear of the drop zone, and will be cursing Martin Dubravka\u2019s late mistake. Another precious point would have done very nicely. But although they rode their luck at times this afternoon, and Spurs were ultimately deserved winners, they acquitted themselves very well at the home of a serious title contender. If Salomon Rondon\u2019s header had gone in, it could have been so different. Surely they have more than enough talent to escape relegation. Tottenham\u2019s title challenge looked over a couple of weeks ago. But now they\u2019re in second place, above Manchester City, and breathing down Liverpool\u2019s neck! Just four points off the top! And a first title since 1961 is still very much on! 90 min +3: Newcastle knock it about, but only where Tottenham let them, in the middle of the park. But suddenly Rondon flicks on a long ball. Longstaff is hovering, just inside the box, but Lloris comes out to clear. 90 min +2: Yedlin looks to zip past Rose on the right, but he\u2019s brought down in full flight. The referee thinks it was a fair 50-50 challenge, and play is waved on. Yedlin isn\u2019t too happy. 90 min +1: Perez clumsily clips Rose\u2019s ankles, allowing Spurs to run the clock down further. 90 min: Lascelles is panicked into hoicking over his own crossbar. Eriksen takes his sweet time over the corner, in the game-management style. There will be four added minutes. Can Spurs hold on? Or will Newcastle save themselves? 89 min: To be fair to Dubravka, Son\u2019s shot had a lot of dip and swerve. But it was straight at him. Anyway, the goalscorer is off, replaced by Dier. 87 min: Son chases a lost cause down the inside-left channel. Dubravka, his head muddled, slides out and gets to the ball ahead of Son, but only clips it to Llorente, who should slam home ... but whacks wide left of an unguarded goal. 86 min: Ritchie is replaced by the Newcastle debutant Barreca. 85 min: Newcastle look sickened to a man, and no wonder: that was an appalling mistake by Dubravka. They look to respond, Longstaff winning a free kick out on the right. But the set piece is wasted. Wembley is in fine voice now. Llorente brings the ball down on the edge of the Newcastle box. He tees it up for Son, who shifts to the right and then batters low and hard towards goal. Dubravka should parry at the very least; claim probably. But he lets the shot squirt under his hands. Into the net it flies. And Tottenham\u2019s title challenge is on! 82 min: Newcastle replace Atsu with Ritchie. 81 min: Sissoko strides down the left and wins a corner off Lejeune. Trippier takes, and loops it into the mixer. Llorente sidefoots towards goal, but the ball pinballs around in a preposterous style, somehow staying out of the net. A good clearing header from Ritchie, there. Newcastle have had some close scrapes this afternoon, and that\u2019s right up there with them. 79 min: Hayden goes off, and comes back on. He\u2019s OK to continue. 78 min: Before the action restarts, Tottenham replace Lamela with Rose. 77 min: Hayden is down requiring some treatment. Time for both teams to take on some water. 75 min: Spurs press Newcastle back some more. But as much as Eriksen, Son and Lamela work, they can\u2019t jemmy any space. Newcastle continue to hold firm. 73 min: A little space for Llorente just inside the Newcastle box. But he can\u2019t sort his feet out. Then Perez goes wheeching up the right, but he\u2019s stopped in his tracks by Sanchez. A suggestion that Sanchez might have used an arm to block his man, but there\u2019s no free kick. 71 min: Trippier floats in a cross from the right. Spurs have sent plenty of men into the box, so Newcastle are happy to see Dubravka come off his line to claim amid a packed box. Newcastle zip upfield, Perez nearly scooting clear down the inside-right channel. But Lloris comes out to intercept and clear. Then Eriksen sends a diagonal ball into the Newcastle box from the right. Llorente is free, but clanks a dismal header high and wide right. He squints into the sun, theatrically blaming the conditions. 69 min: There\u2019s plenty of noise from both fans at Wembley. And yet you can still hear Rafa Benitez loudly micromanaging his men from the touchline! Newcastle respond well, falling into shape, Trippier eventually forced into conceding possession with a desperate speculative long pass. Goal kick. 67 min: Yedlin is booked for a deliberate handball out on the right. The resulting free kick ins a total waste of time. Newcastle go up the other end, Perez sidefooting a curler towards the top right from 20 yards. Lloris does extremely well to turn the shot round the post for a corner. Nothing comes of that either. This is marvellous end-to-end fun now. Both teams will wonder how they\u2019re yet to score. 65 min: Son and Lamela take turns to dribble around in the Newcastle area. The visitors look extremely nervous again. The ball is bundled out for a corner on the left. It\u2019s flicked on at the near post by Son, and Eriksen contorts himself to back-heel it towards the bottom-right from close range. It\u2019s going in, but Schar sticks out a telescopic leg to whip it away from the line! What a clearance! 63 min: Son and Longstaff contest a ball on the edge of the Newcastle box. Longstaff wins the challenge and strides off, only to get a slap in the mush from Son. All accidental, but it\u2019s a chance for Longstaff to go down, buying time for his team-mates to regroup. They\u2019d been chasing shadows for a few minutes. 62 min: Spurs really have stepped it up. Trippier and Son cause Newcastle all manner of bother down the right, with their cute flicks and overlapping runs. Newcastle hold out, but the hosts are beginning to ask questions again. 60 min: Spurs make the first switch of the day, Lucas Moura making way for the hero of Wednesday night against Watford, Fernando Llorente. 58 min: Spurs up their game! Lifting the pace a bit, they ping it around to pull Newcastle this way and that. Then Eriksen slides a ball down the inside right for Trippier, whose low cross is hacked clear just in time by Hayden with Son ready to pull the trigger from six yards. That\u2019s got the crowd going, too; they had also been a little flat since the restart. 57 min: Lascelles and Lucas contest a long ball down the Spurs right. Lascelles brushes Lucas into touch and shepherds the ball out for a goal kick. The body language of the two men is instructive: Lascelles strides back upfield with purpose, while Lucas hangs his head a little and trudges back onto the pitch. Spurs need to up their game. 55 min: Yedlin is again sent scampering down the right. His cross, intended for Rondon, is only half cleared, then Sissoko gifts possession to Ritchie instead of blootering clear. Ritchie sends a shot towards the bottom left from distance, but it\u2019s an easy claim for Lloris. Newcastle look a much more potent attacking force now. 54 min: Lamela chases after a ball bouncing down the inside-right channel. He nearly nips in between Lascelles and Longstaff, who are in the business of confusing each other. But the ball fortunately breaks through to Dubravka, who gathers. 53 min: Spurs seem a little uncertain all of a sudden. They\u2019re gifted a free kick inside Newcastle territory, but Eriksen sends the ball into the box with an uncharacteristic lack of wit. It\u2019s easy pickings for Dubravka. 51 min: It\u2019s Newcastle\u2019s turn to hit the woodwork! Some good play by Ritchie, Longstaff and Perez to gain ground down the middle. Then Rondon spreads play to Yedlin on the right. Yedlin\u2019s cross is magnificent, finding Rondon, who heads towards the bottom right. Lloris is flat-footed and beaten all ends up, but the ball caroms off the post and away from danger. That would have been a very fine goal. 49 min: Lucas brings down a long ball just inside the Newcastle area. He can\u2019t turn to shoot, so lays off for Son, whose scuffed shot is deflected out for a corner on the left. Lamela whips it in, and Sanchez rises highest to send a header wide right. Had that been on target - and once again, it\u2019s a Spurs header that really should have been - it\u2019d have been a goal, because Dubravka was running across in a blind panic. He\u2019d not have got there. 48 min: But the second half has otherwise started pretty much like the first, with Spurs enjoying all the ball, Newcastle holding their shape. 46 min: Longstaff drops deep on the left before wedging a pass down the channel to release Perez. He\u2019s clear on goal, and for a second Wembley falls silent in collective anxiety, with Spurs having stopped to a man. But there\u2019s a reason why, and the flag eventually goes up for an obvious offside. We\u2019re off again! Newcastle get the ball rolling for the second half. Neither team has made a half-time change. Meanwhile on a chilly afternoon, warm up by putting your hands together for Adam Levine: \u201cI hope every time Son runs past Schar he yells out \u2018I got you, babe\u2019.\u201d Half-time reading. Vertonghen is clipped by Perez down the left, and there\u2019s one last first-half chance for Spurs. A free kick, which Eriksen loops into a loaded box. But his delivery is dreadful, and doesn\u2019t even clear the first man. And that\u2019s it, the half-time whistle goes. Newcastle will be pleased with their efforts so far; Spurs look frustrated as they trudge off. 45 min: There will be one added minute of play in this first half. 44 min: But not for long. Ritchie hoicks another ball into the mixer from the left. At the far stick, Perez and Rondon get in each other\u2019s way. Spurs have dominated in attack, but they\u2019ve looked shaky at the back when pressurised. Newcastle have had their half-chances. 43 min: Ritchie switches play and finds Yedlin in space down the right. Yedlin slides a pass down the flank, allowing Perez to dribble into the Spurs box, nearly turning Vertonghen inside out. But he can\u2019t quite make the space for a shot on goal, and Vertonghen does well to recover. The danger\u2019s cleared. 42 min: Eriksen manages to cross from a tight spot out on the right. It\u2019s heading towards Lucas, but Dubravka reads it well and claims just in time, without panic. 40 min: Now it\u2019s Newcastle\u2019s turn to take the sting out of the game, having seriously rocked for a minute back there. It\u2019s not clear how this game is still goalless. 38 min: Son holds up a long Trippier ball down the right. He eventually slips Trippier away on the overlap. Trippier hooks to Vertonghen, whose attempt to guide in a volley isn\u2019t all that. But the ball\u2019s bundled out for a corner. From the set piece, Sissoko makes a better fist of a volley, though his shot is straight at Dubravka. The ball breaks free, but there\u2019s nobody in white on hand to tap home. Oh Harry, where are you? Newcastle clear for another corner, and deal with that second one in short order. 36 min: Lamela swings the corner onto the head of Sanchez, who heads miles over the bar from 12 yards. 35 min: Spurs settle themselves down with a period of sterile domination in the middle of the park. Once equilibrium has been rediscovered, Vertonghen wins a corner down the left. 33 min: More space for Ritchie down the left. He loops long, but Yedlin can\u2019t force the ball on target from a tight angle on the right-hand edge of the six-yard box. Those last three or four minutes will give the away team plenty of encouragement. 31 min: But then their first serious spell of attacking, and they could easily have taken the lead against the run of play! First Ritchie crosses from the left; Perez should score from six yards but scuffs his shot. Rondon looks to prod the ball into the bottom left from a position on the right, but has to settle for a corner. One corner leads to another, which leads to Hayden shooting from the edge of the box. It\u2019s blocked, and Spurs eventually clear their lines. Much, much better from the Toon. 29 min: Vertonghen is enjoying his rare run-out as a wing back. He\u2019s got his attacking boots on today, having spent most of the time deep in Newcastle territory. Here he very nearly releases Lucas down the inside-left channel; not quite. Newcastle are being stretched to breaking point here. Nearly. 27 min: So having said Newcastle\u2019s tactics seemed to be working well enough, now we\u2019re at a stage where it\u2019s a wonder how Spurs aren\u2019t ahead. They\u2019ve had six attempts on goal, of various sorts, while Newcastle have yet to make Lloris do any work whatsoever. 25 min: And now Lucas is sent free down the left by Lamela\u2019s chip. He tries to round Dubravka, but clatters into the keeper. No penalty, and in any case the flag goes up late for offside. 24 min: Spurs hit the bar! Vertonghen crosses from the left. Lucas flicks it on to Lamela, who sends a header towards the top right. But it\u2019s just an inch or two too high, and back it comes off the woodwork. Lucas sends the rebound flying harmlessly over. 23 min: A rare Newcastle attack, as Atsu breaks from the edge of his own box and sets Rondon off down the left. Sanchez does extremely well to shepherd him towards the touchline and turn him around. 22 min: It\u2019s beginning to slip into an attack-versus-defence drill, this. Newcastle seem happy to sit back and allow Spurs to pass it all around them. The home side haven\u2019t been able to make all their possession and territorial advantage pay, that Lucas chance apart, so Newcastle\u2019s tactics are working well enough. 20 min: Eriksen drops a shoulder to make space down the inside right, and has a shot from a very ambitious distance. He whacks it straight into Lascelles, and Newcastle clear. But they\u2019re having trouble getting out of their final third; nearly half of the game so far has been played there. 18 min: Newcastle faff about a bit, just to take the wind out of Tottenham\u2019s sail and let them consider the chance that\u2019s just been spurned. 16 min: A free kick for Tottenham out on the right-hand touchline. They load the box. Eriksen swings it in. Yedlin clears. Lamela picks up possession to the left of the D, and lob-wedges a stunning ball into the centre for Lucas Moura. The Brazilian must score, free six yards out, but plants his header wide with Dubravka waiting for the net to ripple. What a miss! But what a ball from Lamela. 14 min: Eriksen sashays into the Newcastle box from the right. Hayden sticks out a leg, and Eriksen goes over it. The crowd bellow. But the Spurs star doesn\u2019t appeal for a penalty, having slipped before making contact as he tried to jink round the Newcastle man. He was already falling over. Play goes on, as it should, all agree. 12 min: The increasingly impressive Longstaff nearly releases Rondon down the left with a pearler of a diagonal ball from deep. Rondon can\u2019t get past Tripper, but what a pass that was from the young midfielder, whose contribution to the win over City was crucial. He looks a player. 11 min: So, yes, it\u2019s the Chinese new year on Tuesday. In other news, Mike Ashley is in the stand, and he\u2019s getting pelters from the away support, who via the medium of song, are telling him to do one with great force and feeling. 9 min: Spurs stroke it around hither and yon. Waiting for a gap to develop. But no gap develops. Eventually Sissoko curls one in from the right, but Dubravka gathers easily ahead of Winks. 7 min: Son and Eriksen probe down the inside-left channel again. But Newcastle hold their shape on the edge of their area, and there\u2019s no way through. Eventually Sissoko tries to split the defence with a ball down the inside-right channel, but it\u2019s woefully overhit. Goal kick. 5 min: Eriksen looks in the mood. He drops deep and sprays a glorious ball down the middle with the outside of his boot. Son can\u2019t quite reach the pass, but only because Dubravka read the danger early and was out to the edge of his box to gather. 4 min: Spurs put the pressure on Newcastle, Eriksen and Son causing Schar all sorts of bother down the left. Newcastle eventually clear their lines, but only just in time, with white shirts swarming. 2 min: A patient start by Spurs, who stroke it around the back in the considered style. Eventually Alderweireld hoicks it long, allowing Ritchie to head the ball clear. Newcastle\u2019s first touch after one minute and 25 seconds. Then Son has a look down the left, nipping his way past Yedlin but sending a dribbler of a cross into the arms of Dubravka. And we\u2019re off! Spurs get the ball rolling. Newcastle survive the first 24 seconds, which is more than they managed on Tuesday night against Manchester City. The good news keeps on coming for the Magpies. The teams are out! Tottenham wear their storied lilywhite shirts, while Newcastle sport a homage to that burgundy-and-blue-striped rugby-style top made famous during the mid-90s, Ginola, Ferdinand, Newcastle Brown Ale, all that. Both sets of lads look resplendent. A fine atmosphere bubbling away, even if Wembley is far from full. We\u2019ll be off in a minute or two! Mauricio Pochettino speaks! \u201cIt was so important for us after the week against Chelsea and Palace. We were so down. It was important to feel a victory again, and it was a massive boost for us. But Newcastle are in a good moment after beating City, and this is going to be tough. We need to give our best to win. We are going to use Vertonghen on the left, trying to find the best way to defend. We need to change and adapt knowing Newcastle, trying to break them down. The challenge is to get the three points, and then we can think about the position we are in. It will be massive.\u201d The folk at Sky Sports speak to a very content Rafa. \u201cThe main thing was to win against Manchester City. And afterwards, to see two new faces was important. When you go to January, the same players see the same manager. So if you don\u2019t change the manager, you have to change some players, and be sure everyone has a boost. Spurs have some quick players up front, so we have to manage our tactics. I think Tottenham\u2019s side is quite good! They have a very good team.\u201d A quick peek inside the Spurs dressing room. Hanging on the pegs, some special shirts celebrating the Chinese new year, which arrives in three days time. A good omen? Sadly for those with a proud cockerel on their breast, it won\u2019t be the year of the Rooster again until 2029. This is going to be the year of the Pig. Not sure who that\u2019ll benefit. Anyone spring to mind, placard-wielding Newcastle fans? Tottenham make three changes to the side named for the 2-1 win over Watford on Wednesday night. Danny Rose, Serge Aurier and Fernando Llorente make way for Kieran Trippier, Lucas Moura and Erik Lamela. Newcastle are in If It Ain\u2019t Broke territory. They name the same XI that shocked Manchester City on Tuesday evening. Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Trippier, Alderweireld, Sanchez, Vertonghen, Sissoko, Winks, Eriksen, Son, Lamela, Lucas Moura. Subs: Gazzaniga, Foyth, Rose, Walker-Peters, Wanyama, Dier, Llorente. Newcastle United: Dubravka, Yedlin, Schar, Lascelles, Lejeune, Ritchie, Perez, Hayden, Longstaff, Atsu, Rondon. Subs: Woodman, Clark, Fernandez, Manquillo, Barreca, Kenedy, Joselu. Referee: Andre Marriner (West Midlands). Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s season was in serious jeopardy for a moment back there. Out of the League Cup, then out of the FA Cup, and a goal down at home to Watford in the Premier League ... no, it didn\u2019t look too good. But two goals in the last ten minutes stung the Hornets, and in a week which saw both Liverpool and Manchester City drop points, Spurs are suddenly back in the title race! All of a sudden, they\u2019re just two points behind second-placed City, and seven adrift of the leaders Liverpool. With over a third of the race still to run, that\u2019s far from an insurmountable gap. A first English championship since 1961 is still a live possibility, no matter how much Mauricio Pochettino tries to play it down. They need to keep it going though, with little margin left for error. And they\u2019ll feel good about their chances of doing so against Newcastle United, having won their last three against the Toon. Late winners in their last two league matches will have added to the belief that this could still be their year, despite those injuries to Dele Alli and Harry Kane. But while Newcastle have struggled this season, things are beginning to look a little rosier for the Magpies. Two wins on the bounce in the league have taken them away from immediate danger at the bottom, and scalps don\u2019t come any bigger than the champions Manchester City, who were seen off sensationally on Tuesday night. Their new playmaker Miguel Almiron is still waiting for his visa, so won\u2019t be available today, but his mere arrival has given the entire club a boost. They\u2019re priced long for a win today, at 8-1, but they were 14-1 against City and look what happened there. Can either side make it three wins in a row? Spurs are desperate to keep their title hopes alive; Newcastle want to put extra space between themselves and the dropzone. It\u2019s perfectly poised ... and it\u2019s on! Kick off: 12.30pm GMT.",

      "body": "<p>All crises are global, all solutions are local \u2013 and Venezuela is the latest case in point. No sooner had the young pretender, Juan Guaid\u00f3, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/27/juan-guaido-venezuela-has-chance-to-leave-chaos-behind\" title=\"\">declared himself interim president last month</a>, ostensibly supplanting the corrupt old revolutionary, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, than the world piled in. The Trump administration insisted all countries must \u201cpick a side\u201d and back the \u201cforces of freedom\u201d. Russia denounced a US-backed \u201ccoup\u201d. China, Latin American neighbours, Britain and the EU all scrambled for position, in accordance with their particular interests and prejudices.</p> <p>In the past week, this international tug-of-war over Venezuela\u2019s future has grown increasingly dangerous \u2013 and unhelpful \u2013 as protesters and security forces face off on the streets and the political impasse deepens. <br>John Bolton, the US national security adviser, is threatening \u201cserious consequences\u201d (meaning military intervention) should Guaid\u00f3 be harmed or opposition supporters attacked. Maduro warns that the US could face a second Vietnam. </p> <p>Bolton, along with Mike Pence, the US vice-president, and Marco Rubio, a rightwing Republican senator from Florida, are the prime movers in Washington\u2019s latest regime-change adventure. An Iraq war hawk and leading neoconservative, Bolton has an ideological axe to grind. His updated \u201caxis of evil\u201d, now Iraq and North Korea have supposedly been sorted, comprises Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela (but he is still gunning for Iran).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In 1913, Woodrow Wilson declared: \u2018I am going to teach South American republics to elect good men\u2019 \u2013 he didn\u2019t</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rubio speaks for rightwing Cuban-Americans who abhor the Caracas-Havana alliance and hold sway in southern Florida, a key 2020 election battleground. As for Trump, he is on record since 2017 as favouring a \u201cmilitary option\u201d in Venezuela. For him, this sudden ramping up is a welcome distraction from his Mexico border wall defeat.</p> <p>Whatever Bolton says, Trump will not necessarily escalate. He has a record of backing off when the going gets tough \u2013 witness his Syria troop withdrawal plan. Foreign interventions are not Trump\u2019s thing. And the fierce opposition of his sinister chum, Vladimir Putin, will give him pause. Moscow is offering to mediate, which, if it happened, would dent US prestige in its own \u201cbackyard\u201d. For Putin, Venezuela is Washington\u2019s Ukraine. He would dearly like to turn the tables and mete out a reciprocal humiliation.</p> <p>Maduro says Trump covets Venezuela\u2019s oil \u2013 and given last week\u2019s US bid to siphon off the state oil company\u2019s revenues in the name of democracy, that sounds plausible \u2013 but so, too, does Russia, whose extensive Venezuelan interests also include arms sales.</p> <p>China\u2019s sole concern is commercial stability, not regime legitimacy. A parallel is Zimbabwe in 2017, where Beijing, its investments at stake, straddled the fence until Robert Mugabe fell off.</p> <p>Guaid\u00f3\u2019s big splash has caused widening ripples that relate only obliquely to Venezuelans\u2019 suffering. Britain normally follows the sensible practice of recognising states, not particular governments. So the decision by Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, to recognise Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate leader, when he has neither control of the state nor an alternative government in place, looks rash.</p> <p>Hunt\u2019s decision can be explained by Brexit Britain\u2019s pathetic hope to stay in Trump\u2019s good books. Likewise the EU, which set up a novel mechanism last week to circumvent US sanctions on Iran, would rather support regime change at arm\u2019s length in Venezuela than risk further provoking Trump closer to home. Europe, with its high-minded views on democracy and human rights, thus finds itself in bed with some low-life partners, such as Brazil\u2019s Jair Bolsonaro.</p> <p>For the European left, including Britain\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn, the \u201cBolivarian socialist revolution\u201d led by Maduro\u2019s predecessor, the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and its close ties to Castro-era Cuba, remains a totemic cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. The apparent attempt to overturn it by a Yanqui-picked, middle-class political neophyte has produced a viscerally negative reaction, with little thought for the revolution\u2019s failings.</p> <p>Likewise, Guaid\u00f3\u2019s usurpation of Maduro \u201cthe usurper\u201d has been hailed as a new dawn on the neoliberal, interventionist American right, buoyed last week by the return of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/26/elliott-abrams-venezuela-us-special-envoy\" title=\"\">Elliott Abrams</a>, a notorious 1980s cold warrior and self-described \u201ccounter-revolutionary\u201d, as Trump\u2019s Venezuela envoy. This meddling is further confusing a confused situation.</p> <p>Yet all last week\u2019s international manoeuvring and geopolitical jockeying have not changed the four basic alternatives facing Venezuelans, namely: stick with Maduro and hope things somehow improve; risk an indigenous military takeover of indefinite duration; negotiate an agreed, democratic transition leading to free elections, as advocated by Guaid\u00f3; or face possible civil war and foreign intervention.</p> <p>The choice seems obvious, but that does not mean it will happen. One thing is certain. Any lasting solution, if and when it comes, will be local \u2013 as history shows. In 1913, Woodrow Wilson grandly declared: \u201cI am going to teach the South American republics to elect good men.\u201d Needless to say, he didn\u2019t, nor was it his business to try. Yet more than a century later, the lesson must be re-learned: imposing solutions from outside does not work.</p>",

      "bodyText": "All crises are global, all solutions are local \u2013 and Venezuela is the latest case in point. No sooner had the young pretender, Juan Guaid\u00f3, declared himself interim president last month, ostensibly supplanting the corrupt old revolutionary, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, than the world piled in. The Trump administration insisted all countries must \u201cpick a side\u201d and back the \u201cforces of freedom\u201d. Russia denounced a US-backed \u201ccoup\u201d. China, Latin American neighbours, Britain and the EU all scrambled for position, in accordance with their particular interests and prejudices. In the past week, this international tug-of-war over Venezuela\u2019s future has grown increasingly dangerous \u2013 and unhelpful \u2013 as protesters and security forces face off on the streets and the political impasse deepens. John Bolton, the US national security adviser, is threatening \u201cserious consequences\u201d (meaning military intervention) should Guaid\u00f3 be harmed or opposition supporters attacked. Maduro warns that the US could face a second Vietnam. Bolton, along with Mike Pence, the US vice-president, and Marco Rubio, a rightwing Republican senator from Florida, are the prime movers in Washington\u2019s latest regime-change adventure. An Iraq war hawk and leading neoconservative, Bolton has an ideological axe to grind. His updated \u201caxis of evil\u201d, now Iraq and North Korea have supposedly been sorted, comprises Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela (but he is still gunning for Iran). Rubio speaks for rightwing Cuban-Americans who abhor the Caracas-Havana alliance and hold sway in southern Florida, a key 2020 election battleground. As for Trump, he is on record since 2017 as favouring a \u201cmilitary option\u201d in Venezuela. For him, this sudden ramping up is a welcome distraction from his Mexico border wall defeat. Whatever Bolton says, Trump will not necessarily escalate. He has a record of backing off when the going gets tough \u2013 witness his Syria troop withdrawal plan. Foreign interventions are not Trump\u2019s thing. And the fierce opposition of his sinister chum, Vladimir Putin, will give him pause. Moscow is offering to mediate, which, if it happened, would dent US prestige in its own \u201cbackyard\u201d. For Putin, Venezuela is Washington\u2019s Ukraine. He would dearly like to turn the tables and mete out a reciprocal humiliation. Maduro says Trump covets Venezuela\u2019s oil \u2013 and given last week\u2019s US bid to siphon off the state oil company\u2019s revenues in the name of democracy, that sounds plausible \u2013 but so, too, does Russia, whose extensive Venezuelan interests also include arms sales. China\u2019s sole concern is commercial stability, not regime legitimacy. A parallel is Zimbabwe in 2017, where Beijing, its investments at stake, straddled the fence until Robert Mugabe fell off. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s big splash has caused widening ripples that relate only obliquely to Venezuelans\u2019 suffering. Britain normally follows the sensible practice of recognising states, not particular governments. So the decision by Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, to recognise Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate leader, when he has neither control of the state nor an alternative government in place, looks rash. Hunt\u2019s decision can be explained by Brexit Britain\u2019s pathetic hope to stay in Trump\u2019s good books. Likewise the EU, which set up a novel mechanism last week to circumvent US sanctions on Iran, would rather support regime change at arm\u2019s length in Venezuela than risk further provoking Trump closer to home. Europe, with its high-minded views on democracy and human rights, thus finds itself in bed with some low-life partners, such as Brazil\u2019s Jair Bolsonaro. For the European left, including Britain\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn, the \u201cBolivarian socialist revolution\u201d led by Maduro\u2019s predecessor, the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and its close ties to Castro-era Cuba, remains a totemic cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. The apparent attempt to overturn it by a Yanqui-picked, middle-class political neophyte has produced a viscerally negative reaction, with little thought for the revolution\u2019s failings. Likewise, Guaid\u00f3\u2019s usurpation of Maduro \u201cthe usurper\u201d has been hailed as a new dawn on the neoliberal, interventionist American right, buoyed last week by the return of Elliott Abrams, a notorious 1980s cold warrior and self-described \u201ccounter-revolutionary\u201d, as Trump\u2019s Venezuela envoy. This meddling is further confusing a confused situation. Yet all last week\u2019s international manoeuvring and geopolitical jockeying have not changed the four basic alternatives facing Venezuelans, namely: stick with Maduro and hope things somehow improve; risk an indigenous military takeover of indefinite duration; negotiate an agreed, democratic transition leading to free elections, as advocated by Guaid\u00f3; or face possible civil war and foreign intervention. The choice seems obvious, but that does not mean it will happen. One thing is certain. Any lasting solution, if and when it comes, will be local \u2013 as history shows. In 1913, Woodrow Wilson grandly declared: \u201cI am going to teach the South American republics to elect good men.\u201d Needless to say, he didn\u2019t, nor was it his business to try. Yet more than a century later, the lesson must be re-learned: imposing solutions from outside does not work.",

The alleged assault, which Jackson called an attempted \u201cbarbaric lynching\u201d, was the latest in a line of hate attacks, including the antisemitic mass shooting last year at a Pittsburgh synagogue, Jackson said. And, according to Jackson, the president, with his words and actions, has fostered an environment where hatred has thrived and violence has been \u201cencouraged\u201d. \u201cThe spirit of demeaning and bullying has been revived,\u201d Jackson said in a phone interview, adding that he believed Trump was pushing the country towards \u201ca crisis\u201d.

Trump has condemned the assault, calling it \u201chorrible\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The trouble with setting your band up as unwholesome desperadoes, viscerally opposed to cosy arts careerism, is that it\u2019s quite difficult to then have a career.</p> <p>Few bands in recent years have flown the flag for ostentatious discomfort as high as Fat White Family. Originally headquartered in a south London squat, the Fat Whites came to prominence around six years ago, touting provocation, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r95X2tXd8b0\" title=\"\">offal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nwUtzWzWh8\" title=\"\">Nazi references</a> and \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 drug use. Over the course of two albums, they have been responsible for myth-making in British indie rock not witnessed since the Libertines (electronic music is another story).</p> <p>When Margaret Thatcher died, the Brixton street party featured a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-death-party-brixton-glasgow\" title=\"\">\u201cThe Bitch Is Dead\u201d banner</a> that was of the Fat Whites\u2019 making, a wonderfully old-school tactic that earned appositely retro tabloid outrage. Then there was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/31/fat-white-family-social-protest-face-offs-interview-songs-for-our-mothers\" title=\"\">infighting</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfmajMyxAZc\" title=\"\">heroin</a>, the pneumonia, the members leaving, the homelessness, the ayahuasca, the rehab, the umpteen side-projects all united by the seemingly core inability of the Fat Whites to parlay their art into a living. The narrative that surrounds them can border on the heroic. The Fat Whites are <a href=\"https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/ryz9dv/fat-white-family-interview-2016\" title=\"\">the last of a dying breed</a>, runs the story, irritants channelling rock\u2019s subversive essence in an era of safe, consumable ditties, the last hurrah of a super-creative squat scene that has endured in Brixton for generations, but is now over, thanks to the evolution of London as a haven where dubious kleptocrats launder their foreign capital into skyscrapers. A slightly different view would find the band\u2019s fetishistic desire to shock puerile, but effectively counterbalanced by an anti-gentrification agenda (Fat Whites, not flat whites) and some lovely Neu! keyboard sounds. The band very nearly self-destructed, which would have fit their story arc splendidly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The big new thing is, Fat White Family would like you to dance rather than throw things</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Somehow, however, in April the reconfigured Fat Whites will release their third album, <em>Serfs Up!</em> That nod to the Beach Boys\u2019 <em>Surf\u2019s Up</em> is just the latest in a long line of Fat White references to other records, both sunny and dark; they take their music history seriously. <em>Serfs Up!</em> finds the band on a new label, Domino.

      "bodyText": "The trouble with setting your band up as unwholesome desperadoes, viscerally opposed to cosy arts careerism, is that it\u2019s quite difficult to then have a career. Few bands in recent years have flown the flag for ostentatious discomfort as high as Fat White Family. Originally headquartered in a south London squat, the Fat Whites came to prominence around six years ago, touting provocation, offal, Nazi references and \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 drug use. Over the course of two albums, they have been responsible for myth-making in British indie rock not witnessed since the Libertines (electronic music is another story). When Margaret Thatcher died, the Brixton street party featured a \u201cThe Bitch Is Dead\u201d banner that was of the Fat Whites\u2019 making, a wonderfully old-school tactic that earned appositely retro tabloid outrage. Then there was the infighting, the heroin, the pneumonia, the members leaving, the homelessness, the ayahuasca, the rehab, the umpteen side-projects all united by the seemingly core inability of the Fat Whites to parlay their art into a living. The narrative that surrounds them can border on the heroic. The Fat Whites are the last of a dying breed, runs the story, irritants channelling rock\u2019s subversive essence in an era of safe, consumable ditties, the last hurrah of a super-creative squat scene that has endured in Brixton for generations, but is now over, thanks to the evolution of London as a haven where dubious kleptocrats launder their foreign capital into skyscrapers. A slightly different view would find the band\u2019s fetishistic desire to shock puerile, but effectively counterbalanced by an anti-gentrification agenda (Fat Whites, not flat whites) and some lovely Neu! keyboard sounds. The band very nearly self-destructed, which would have fit their story arc splendidly. Somehow, however, in April the reconfigured Fat Whites will release their third album, Serfs Up! That nod to the Beach Boys\u2019 Surf\u2019s Up is just the latest in a long line of Fat White references to other records, both sunny and dark; they take their music history seriously. Serfs Up! finds the band on a new label, Domino. It\u2019s a strange pairing, until it makes perfect sense. Domino is probably best known as home to Arctic Monkeys \u2013 not exactly light entertainment careerists feathering their nests with disposable pap, more people with guitars who have turned cachet into money into roofs over their heads. \u201cAnyone with a nose for genuine rock\u2019n\u2019roll already knows that Fat White Family are plainly the most exciting, influential and talked-about band to come out of this country in the last few years,\u201d declared Domino boss Laurence Bell in December 2016, when he took them in. It was a written statement, but Bell\u2019s voice seemed muffled from adopting the brace position. \u201cWe are delighted, if slightly nervous, at the prospect of taking them to the next level.\u201d Fat White Family\u2019s forthcoming third outing is set to be \u201cthe most gratifying and unexpected creative volte face in recent musical history\u201d, according to a sweetly hyperbolic press release.

      "body": "<p><strong>Equal pay requires honest discussions</strong></p> <p>The gender pay gap, as every right-thinking person knows, is a feminist myth. Those figures you\u2019ve seen about white women earning around 80% of what white men make, and black women earning just 61%, are probably wrong. And if they\u2019re not, then, as many conservatives have pointed out, there are rational explanations for the disparity. Such as the fact that, as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcjxSThD54\">Jordan Peterson has explained</a>, women are just more agreeable than men, meaning they don\u2019t ask for more money. Which is a very agreeable explanation if you don\u2019t want to confront structural inequality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2019/jan/26/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-swearing-rashida-tlaib\">Women swear sometimes \u2013 let's get the hell over it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While many on the right insist the gender pay gap doesn\u2019t exist, they also appear keen to block legislation that would strengthen equal pay protection and make it easier for employees to share wage information. Which would appear to be a contradictory position. As congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1090639477809336320\">tweeted</a> on Wednesday \u201cIf \u2018the wage gap is a myth\u2019 as some allege, then workplaces should have no problem with workers disclosing our salaries with one another.\u201d</p> <p>Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s tweet followed a news conference in which she, along with other Democrats, re-introduced the Paycheck Fairness Act, which strives to close the gender wage gap by giving women tools to challenge unequal pay. For example, it would stop employers retaliating against workers who discuss their salaries with each other. The bill was first introduced in 1997, but has been repeatedly blocked by Republicans.</p> <p>While the pay gap has narrowed since 1980, not much progress has been made in the last 15 years. Arguably, one reason for this is the lack of transparency around pay. Most of us don\u2019t know how much our colleagues make, which makes it easier for companies to ignore the issue. Indeed, Lean In\u2019s 2018 <a href=\"https://leanin.org/data-about-the-gender-pay-gap-for-black-women#endnote3\">Black Women\u2019s Equal Pay Survey</a> found that 50% of Americans aren\u2019t aware of pay gap between black and white women, and hiring managers are also ignorant of the disparity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/10/pay-gap-worsened-for-women-under-40-over-last-two-years-us-study-finds\">Pay gap worsened for women under 40 over last two years, US study finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Talking about how much you make can be difficult but it is important. There\u2019s a lot of power in being transparent about your income and working together with your colleagues to ensure everyone is treated fairly. Last year, for example, the actress Octavia Spencer <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2018/01/octavia-spencer-jessica-chastain-pay-equity-women-1201921282/\">revealed</a> that Jessica Chastain helped her get five times her salary on a project after realizing that women of colour make far less than white women. Spencer also recently told an audience at the <a href=\"https://www.essence.com/celebrity/lebron-james-octavia-spencer-equal-pay-netflix-series/\">Sundance Film Festival</a> that LeBron James had intervened to get her more pay for her role in a new Netflix series. \u201cI have to say, when I was negotiating my deal for <em>Madam C.J.</em>, LeBron James had to intervene,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need all our male counterparts to be in the fight with us.\u201d</p> <p>Knowledge is power and there is more power in numbers. It\u2019s no surprise that some companies remain eager to keep their employees in the dark.</p> <p><strong>Mariah Carey hits a low with Saudi Arabia performance</strong></p> <p>On Thursday, Mariah Carey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/31/mariah-carey-defies-activists-to-perform-in-saudi-arabia\">performed in Saudi Arabia</a> alongside DJ Tiesto and Sean Paul. Her appearance generated an enormous backlash amongst activists, who pointed out that the kingdom is using entertainment as a distraction from human rights abuses. Carey\u2019s publicists said that she saw the opportunity to work towards gender desegregation which is a somewhat laughable claim considering the number of Saudi women\u2019s rights activists who have been imprisoned recently.

As congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on Wednesday \u201cIf \u2018the wage gap is a myth\u2019 as some allege, then workplaces should have no problem with workers disclosing our salaries with one another.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s tweet followed a news conference in which she, along with other Democrats, re-introduced the Paycheck Fairness Act, which strives to close the gender wage gap by giving women tools to challenge unequal pay. For example, it would stop employers retaliating against workers who discuss their salaries with each other. The bill was first introduced in 1997, but has been repeatedly blocked by Republicans. While the pay gap has narrowed since 1980, not much progress has been made in the last 15 years. Arguably, one reason for this is the lack of transparency around pay. Most of us don\u2019t know how much our colleagues make, which makes it easier for companies to ignore the issue. Indeed, Lean In\u2019s 2018 Black Women\u2019s Equal Pay Survey found that 50% of Americans aren\u2019t aware of pay gap between black and white women, and hiring managers are also ignorant of the disparity. Talking about how much you make can be difficult but it is important. There\u2019s a lot of power in being transparent about your income and working together with your colleagues to ensure everyone is treated fairly. Last year, for example, the actress Octavia Spencer revealed that Jessica Chastain helped her get five times her salary on a project after realizing that women of colour make far less than white women. Spencer also recently told an audience at the Sundance Film Festival that LeBron James had intervened to get her more pay for her role in a new Netflix series. \u201cI have to say, when I was negotiating my deal for Madam C.J., LeBron James had to intervene,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need all our male counterparts to be in the fight with us.\u201d Knowledge is power and there is more power in numbers. It\u2019s no surprise that some companies remain eager to keep their employees in the dark. Mariah Carey hits a low with Saudi Arabia performance On Thursday, Mariah Carey performed in Saudi Arabia alongside DJ Tiesto and Sean Paul. Her appearance generated an enormous backlash amongst activists, who pointed out that the kingdom is using entertainment as a distraction from human rights abuses. Carey\u2019s publicists said that she saw the opportunity to work towards gender desegregation which is a somewhat laughable claim considering the number of Saudi women\u2019s rights activists who have been imprisoned recently. Owen Jones writes about why Mariah was wrong to play here. The sister of Loujain Alhathloul, one of the imprisoned activists, also wrote a piece for CNN about Carey which is well worth reading. The Pool enters administration Online women\u2019s magazine The Pool is shuttering. Which is more bad news in a very bad couple of weeks for digital media. UAE\u2019s very male gender equality awards Last Sunday the United Arab Emirates held an awards show honouring the people who had advanced gender equality in the country. The winners were all men. Abracadabra, the patriarchy is toppled! The International Magicians Society, the world\u2019s largest magic organization, has seen a 35% increase in female membership over the past three years. Similarly, the LA-based Academy of Magical Arts has also seen women in its classes increase from 15% to 50% over the same period. OZY has an interesting piece on how \u201cwomen are crashing the male-dominated world of magic.\u201d Think all this female magic might spell trouble for men.",

The pope, who arrives in Abu Dhabi on Sunday evening, will hold talks with the crown prince, address the interfaith meeting, celebrate mass at a sports stadium, and lay foundation stones with the Grand Imam, Ahmed Al Tayyib, for a new church and mosque.</p> <p>The two faith leaders will sign a global agreement of \u201cpeace, fraternity and mutual respect on behalf of their billions of followers around the world\u201d.</p> <p>In a video message recorded before the trip, Francis said the UAE sought to be \u201ca model of coexistence, brotherhood, and encounter between different civilisations and cultures\u201d. He looked forward to writing \u201ca new page in the history of relations between religions, confirming that we are brothers and sisters, even though we are different.\u201d</p> <p>The UAE has proclaimed 2019 the \u201cyear of tolerance\u201d to promote it as a moderate, stable and inclusive nation.</p> <p>The government has launched an anti-discrimination law, a ministry of tolerance and an International Institute for Tolerance to challenge extremism and promote the UAE as a role model for co-existence.</p> <p>More than 200 nationalities live in the UAE.

      "bodyText": "Pope Francis will be the first pontiff to visit the Arabian peninsula, the birthplace of Islam, when he celebrates mass this week in front of an expected 120,000 people in Abu Dhabi. The pope has been invited to visit the United Arab Emirates by Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, to take part in an international interfaith meeting as part of the Gulf state\u2019s \u201cyear of tolerance\u201d. But Francis has faced criticism over the two-day visit because of the UAE\u2019s part in the war in Yemen as a member of the Saudi-led coalition against the Houthi armed movement. The pope, who arrives in Abu Dhabi on Sunday evening, will hold talks with the crown prince, address the interfaith meeting, celebrate mass at a sports stadium, and lay foundation stones with the Grand Imam, Ahmed Al Tayyib, for a new church and mosque. The two faith leaders will sign a global agreement of \u201cpeace, fraternity and mutual respect on behalf of their billions of followers around the world\u201d. In a video message recorded before the trip, Francis said the UAE sought to be \u201ca model of coexistence, brotherhood, and encounter between different civilisations and cultures\u201d. He looked forward to writing \u201ca new page in the history of relations between religions, confirming that we are brothers and sisters, even though we are different.\u201d The UAE has proclaimed 2019 the \u201cyear of tolerance\u201d to promote it as a moderate, stable and inclusive nation. The government has launched an anti-discrimination law, a ministry of tolerance and an International Institute for Tolerance to challenge extremism and promote the UAE as a role model for co-existence. More than 200 nationalities live in the UAE. An estimated 90% of the 9.6 million population are expatriates, with South Asians the largest group. About three quarters of the population is Muslim. Christians form 9%, Hindus 7% and Buddhists 2%, according to the World Population Review. Catholics from the expatriate community are expected to make up a majority of those attending the mass on Tuesday. Bishop Paul Hinder, the vicar apostolic of Southern Arabia \u2013 the head of the Catholic church in the UAE, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Yemen \u2013 said Francis\u2019s visit to the \u201cvery heart of Islam\u201d would \u201cset a sign, namely that we must build bridges even if we do not believe in the same things\u201d. He told Alle Welt, a Catholic magazine: \u201cThis without doubt is a historic visit, as a pope has never been to the Arab Peninsula before and until recently was considered unthinkable.\u201d Christians in the Gulf had been \u201cwaiting for this visit for a very long time,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m afraid some of them may be disappointed as not all those who want will be able to participate for logistical reasons.\u201d The Arab population was also \u201cvery open and enthusiastic about the visit,\u201d he said. But Emile Nakhleh, a former CIA official, said the papal visit could not be justified when the UAE was embroiled in the war in Yemen. \u201cIt\u2019s just not good optics for the pope to be visiting the UAE when they are still involved in all kinds of humanitarian atrocities in Yemen,\u201d he told National Catholic Reporter. \u201cIf he does not raise this issue, the pope would lose much credibility in the Middle East.\u201d Father Paul Lansu of the Catholic peace organisation Pax Christi International said he hoped the pope could \u201cconvince the leadership of the Emirates to find another policy concerning Yemen\u201d. Last year, the UN said the Saudi-led coalition had killed thousands of Yemenis in airstrikes and may have committed war crimes under international law. This month UN officials said more than 10 million people in Yemen were at risk of starvation.

      "body": "<p>Why do so many people these days seem so stressed out and anxious? It\u2019s a common question, among mental health professionals and laypeople alike, but there\u2019s a case to be made that it\u2019s exactly upside down. How come there\u2019s anyone who<em> isn\u2019t </em>paralysed by anxiety, every hour of every day? After all, anxiety thrives in conditions of uncertainty \u2013 and nowadays the world is full of potential threats we don\u2019t fully understand and can\u2019t control.</p> <p>Most of us just have to take it on trust that planes won\u2019t fall out of the sky, or that the milk in our fridge won\u2019t give us listeria. Sudden, unpredictable movements in the global financial system threaten to ruin anyone\u2019s livelihood at any moment; plus now we have all the many unknowns around Brexit, an unstable liar in charge of America\u2019s nuclear codes, and the omnipresent spectre of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change\" title=\"\">climate change</a>. And as if all that weren\u2019t enough, we spend our days marinating in an online environment designed to stoke panic about any remaining threats we might have been managing to ignore.</p> <p>Some definitions may help here. \u201cStress\u201d, as psychologists tend to use it, means an immediate response to an external pressure, and a moderate amount can actually be a good thing: totally unstressed people never revise for exams, or meet work deadlines. In most everyday contexts, when the external pressure stops, so does the stress. Which means that by far the simplest way to deal with stress, whenever possible, is to deal with whatever\u2019s bothering you head on \u2013 to tackle the difficult piece of work, to talk to the friend you\u2019ve fallen out with \u2013 or, failing that, to distance or distract yourself from its source. (Persistent and chronic stress requires a different approach.)</p> <p>But anxiety is a particular kind of internal response to stress, and it\u2019s frequently far more fraught. As the Australian author Sarah Wilson points out in her combined memoir and anxiety self-help manual, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/first-we-make-the-beast-beautiful.html\" title=\"\">First, We Make the Beast Beautiful</a>, the problem isn\u2019t simply that there are a lot of reasons to be anxious. It\u2019s also that, perversely, society actually rewards certain anxious behaviours, such as being frenetically busy and driven \u2013 while the \u201creward\u201d for managing to free yourself from anxiety might be a reputation for laziness, complacency, or showing insufficient concern about the state of the world. Then there\u2019s the fact that anxiety is self-reinforcing: once you\u2019re feeling anxious, you\u2019re primed to seek further things to feel anxious about \u2013 including, as if that vicious circle weren\u2019t frustrating enough, your anxiety itself.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Anxiety, at root, isn\u2019t a bizarre psychological anomaly, but a fundamental aspect of human functioning</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAnxiety\u201d, of course, is also the name for a family of official psychological disorders. But it\u2019s a condition that makes it unusually clear that the line between \u201cmental illness\u201d and \u201cordinary human distress\u201d is a subjective one, dependent as much on cultural conventions as on science. The main reason \u201cgeneralised anxiety disorder\u201d is so much more prevalent now is that it was only defined as a disorder in psychiatry\u2019s bible, the <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm\" title=\"\">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a>, in 1980. (If you feel \u201ckeyed up or on edge\u201d, or have \u201cdifficulty concentrating\u201d, it\u2019s possible you qualify.) And one main reason it surged from 2001 onwards was a concerted media push by GlaxoSmithKline, after it received US approval to market its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/06/dont-know-who-am-antidepressant-long-term-use\" title=\"\">antidepressant Paxil</a> (Seroxat in the UK) in the treatment of anxiety. \u201cLocal newscasts around [the United States] reported that as many as 10 million Americans suffered from an unrecognised disease,\u201d the journalist Brendan Koerner has written. \u201cViewers were urged to watch for the symptoms: restlessness, fatigue, irritability, muscle tension, nausea, diarrhoea, and sweating \u2026\u201d</p> <p>To be clear, none of this is to suggest that those with a diagnosed anxiety disorder don\u2019t have a real illness, or that medication isn\u2019t often part of the solution: \u201cThe basic premise for an anxiety disorder, or when anxiety becomes a clinical problem, is when anxiety controls our life, rather than us being able to control our anxiety,\u201d says <a href=\"http://robertedelmann.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Robert Edelmann</a>, emeritus professor of forensic and clinical psychology at the University of Roehampton. But it\u2019s also a reminder that anxiety, at root, isn\u2019t a bizarre psychological anomaly, but a fundamental aspect of human functioning. The problem, explains the psychology writer James Clear, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/atomic-habits-an-easy-and-proven-way-to-build-good-habits-a.html\" title=\"\">Atomic Habits</a>, is that it\u2019s a response evolution bequeathed us for a setting radically different from today\u2019s.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All anxiety contains a kernel of good news: you wouldn\u2019t feel anxious if there weren\u2019t the chance of things going well</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Prehistoric humans lived in an \u201cimmediate-return environment\u201d, as other mammals still do: their moment-to-moment choices mattered because of the immediate difference they made. You saw a predator and felt a surge of anxiety, which motivated you to evade it. Or you felt dangerously hungry, and anxiety focused your attention on quickly finding food. Once the threat was resolved, the anxiety would evaporate. But modern humans live in a \u201cdelayed-return environment\u201d. We get paid for our work at the end of the week or month; we study for educational qualifications that take years. When we save money \u2013 or don\u2019t \u2013 the consequences might not be felt for decades. And so the anxiety has nowhere to go. Instead, it accumulates and curdles.</p> <p>This helps explain why national and international news events, such as Brexit or the election of Donald Trump, are such a widespread source of personal anxiety, including of the clinical kind. Some people \u2013 undocumented immigrants in Trump\u2019s America, for example \u2013 are affected in direct, unambiguous ways. But even if you ultimately won\u2019t be, you\u2019ll have no way of knowing that for some time. Moreover, it often feels like there\u2019s nothing you can do in response \u2013 no equivalent to the prehistoric hunter-gatherer\u2019s decision to start running away, or go looking for food. When no constructive action seems possible, we resort to worry and rumination, which feel somehow constructive, even though they aren\u2019t. One reaction to the anxiety of being immersed in a 24-hour news cycle \u201cis that people try to find out more information, because anxiety is about a lack of control and they believe that having more information will make them feel more in control\u201d, says the American therapist <a href=\"https://lorigottlieb.com/\" title=\"\">Lori Gottlieb</a>, author of the forthcoming book Maybe You Should Talk to Someone. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t \u2013 it just makes people feel more anxious.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/11/living-in-moment-past-future-pliver-burkeman\">Living in the moment? Good - but don\u2019t forget the past or future | Oliver Burkeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is why most non-pharmaceutical solutions to anxiety, whatever its cause, involve the limited and realistic exertion of control: figuring out what constructive actions you can take, and taking them, while refraining from struggling to control things you can\u2019t, which is a recipe for additional anxiety. (This is the \u201cdichotomy of control\u201d, a distinction dating to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/dec/11/how-would-the-stoics-cope-today\" title=\"\">the Stoics</a> of ancient Greece and Rome.) You can\u2019t personally guarantee a comfortable retirement, or long-term physical health, let alone the optimal relationship between Britain and the rest of Europe. But you can calculate what you can afford to save, and track your saving. You can exercise a few times a week, and eat more leafy greens. You can take local, concrete political action. Whether or not you end up achieving your desired goal, your anxiety levels will almost certainly fall.</p> <p>Finally, it\u2019s worth recognising \u2013 as the Danish philosopher <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Soren-Kierkegaard\" title=\"\">S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard</a> observed in The Concept of Anxiety back in 1844 \u2013 that all anxiety contains a kernel of good news: you wouldn\u2019t feel anxious in the first place if you had no freedom, and if there weren\u2019t at least the possibility of things turning out well. \u201cOne would have no anxiety if there were no possibility whatever,\u201d wrote the psychologist Rollo May, paraphrasing Kierkegaard. If you knew with absolute certainty that life from now on would bring only failure and defeat, you might well be depressed, but you wouldn\u2019t feel on edge. Anxiety is the experience of knowing that life might bring success, fulfilment and joy, combined with the fear that you don\u2019t know how to ensure that\u2019s what will happen. And while severe anxiety can certainly be a debilitating problem, demanding treatment, some sense of uncertainty about the future is surely part of what makes life worth living. If you ever actually managed to rule out the potential for any nasty surprises, you\u2019d find that you\u2019d ruled out the possibility of any good ones, too.</p> <p><em>The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can\u2019t Stand Positive Thinking by Oliver Burkeman is published by Vintage (\u00a39.99).

When no constructive action seems possible, we resort to worry and rumination, which feel somehow constructive, even though they aren\u2019t. One reaction to the anxiety of being immersed in a 24-hour news cycle \u201cis that people try to find out more information, because anxiety is about a lack of control and they believe that having more information will make them feel more in control\u201d, says the American therapist Lori Gottlieb, author of the forthcoming book Maybe You Should Talk to Someone. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t \u2013 it just makes people feel more anxious.\u201d This is why most non-pharmaceutical solutions to anxiety, whatever its cause, involve the limited and realistic exertion of control: figuring out what constructive actions you can take, and taking them, while refraining from struggling to control things you can\u2019t, which is a recipe for additional anxiety. (This is the \u201cdichotomy of control\u201d, a distinction dating to the Stoics of ancient Greece and Rome.) You can\u2019t personally guarantee a comfortable retirement, or long-term physical health, let alone the optimal relationship between Britain and the rest of Europe. But you can calculate what you can afford to save, and track your saving. You can exercise a few times a week, and eat more leafy greens. You can take local, concrete political action. Whether or not you end up achieving your desired goal, your anxiety levels will almost certainly fall. Finally, it\u2019s worth recognising \u2013 as the Danish philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard observed in The Concept of Anxiety back in 1844 \u2013 that all anxiety contains a kernel of good news: you wouldn\u2019t feel anxious in the first place if you had no freedom, and if there weren\u2019t at least the possibility of things turning out well. \u201cOne would have no anxiety if there were no possibility whatever,\u201d wrote the psychologist Rollo May, paraphrasing Kierkegaard. If you knew with absolute certainty that life from now on would bring only failure and defeat, you might well be depressed, but you wouldn\u2019t feel on edge. Anxiety is the experience of knowing that life might bring success, fulfilment and joy, combined with the fear that you don\u2019t know how to ensure that\u2019s what will happen. And while severe anxiety can certainly be a debilitating problem, demanding treatment, some sense of uncertainty about the future is surely part of what makes life worth living. If you ever actually managed to rule out the potential for any nasty surprises, you\u2019d find that you\u2019d ruled out the possibility of any good ones, too.

He claimed that if Wales beat France in Paris they would have a great chance of winning the championship. He is right. Having pulled off the biggest comeback in Championship history with their extraordinary 24-19 victory, Wales swan off to the Riviera for a few days, as they prepare for their assignment in Rome next Saturday, which they will surely win. That would put them on two wins from two, both of them away. Momentum would be theirs as they return to Cardiff in round three to take on England. The international game plays to a fractured rhythm, a window here, a window there, but Wales\u2019s windows are united by a winning streak poised to break records. Friday night\u2019s win in Paris, however outlandish, was Wales\u2019s 10th in a row, a record for this millennium. If they beat Italy they would equal the 11 consecutive wins of the early 20th century that remains Wales\u2019s record. Which adds a certain spice, as if spice were needed, to that visit of England.

Currently, women see several, if not more than a dozen, different midwives before, during and after birth.

Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, told the Observer: \u201cIt\u2019s a mystery why the Neighbourhood Midwives service \u2013 which has near universal support \u2013 has suddenly closed, and it\u2019s been a real shock to many users. \u201cSince last week, I\u2019ve had a lot of women in touch very upset and now unclear about their birthing plan and who their midwife is, as well as previous users of the service who sing its praises and want it to continue.\u201d She said she was in contact with the CCG \u201cto try to get to the bottom of this and what caused the closure, as well as to make the case that the service should reopen\u201d.",

Her mother worked three jobs, and her father left the family home when Leanne was 13. In her teens, Leanne ended up in a violent relationship. Meeting Wes changed her life, she says. She was a table dancer when they met at a club in Manchester. He was 18, a young star breaking into the first team at Manchester United \u2013 not that she had any inkling. They caught each other\u2019s eye. \u201cAfter a few drinks I went over and kissed him,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cI\u2019d never done anything like that before. Afterwards I said, \u2018Anyway, what\u2019s your name?\u2019\u201d She laughs.</p> <p>She had dreamed of being a glamour model, but Wes wasn\u2019t so sure. Instead Leanne went to college to study beauty therapy. At 26 she was pregnant with their first child, Halle, and became a stay-at-home mother. Leanne says she\u2019s doing this interview now because she wants to help other women avoid the mistakes she made. \u201cFemale empowerment,\u201d she says, firmly. \u201cAll too often, as wives, we are alienated from meetings and investments. People take advantage in every sense, charging you extortionate prices. You are manipulated into doing crap investments so others can make a few quid off the back of you.\u201d The family have lost money on poor financial advice and <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4216516/Real-Housewives-Cheshire-stars-feud-500-000-loan.html\" title=\"\">are currently engaged in a legal dispute</a> with a former friend, The Real Housewives Of Cheshire star Dawn Ward, after allegedly lending her \u00a3500,000. The Browns are selling up and downsizing to a smaller property.</p> <p>Despite the challenges, the couple have been together 21 years. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, we\u2019ve had our tough times,\u201d says Leanne, \u201cbut I love him to bits.\u201d As we chat, Wes arrives home and helps their three daughters, Halle, 16, Lilia, 11, and Lola, 7, with their homework. \u201cHe\u2019s always been a hands-on dad,\u201d says their mother, proudly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73147041bbedeb8e8a07ef2d3ca2deaaab86a4ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73147041bbedeb8e8a07ef2d3ca2deaaab86a4ed/0_448_6192_6389/969.jpg\" alt=\"Erin Borini\" width=\"969\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Erin Borini has moved house five times in six years, most recently to Milan, with footballer husband Fabio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry Borden/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back in the kitchen, Erin advises the women on how to pose for the camera. \u201cPut one leg behind, and lean back like Victoria Beckham.\u201d They laugh. Erin met Fabio Borini when he signed for Liverpool, her home town. She was already earning good money as a model, her face on billboards across Europe. She says she liked Fabio\u2019s quietness. \u201cHe was going down to London on the train for the day and I said he should get a Young Person\u2019s Railcard. My friend said, \u2018Erin! He\u2019s on thousands a week, he doesn\u2019t need a third off!\u2019 But he liked that I saw him as a human being.\u201d In their six years together they\u2019ve moved house five times, most recently to Milan. All of the women have experienced this itinerant way of life: a sudden move to a new club, the wives expected to manage the logistics.</p> <p>At 24, Rachel is the youngest of the group. She smiles a lot, but there is a seriousness about her, too. Her life changed dramatically when her fiance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/13/ryan-mason-forced-to-retire-from-football-after-head-injury\" title=\"\">Ryan, was injured in a collision on the pitch</a> in 2017. The memories are still raw. When we meet at her home in Hertfordshire, she settles into a sofa and describes herself as \u201ca geek, with my nose in a book\u201d (her favourite novel is War And Peace). She studied business and economics at Lancaster University, and had little interest in finding a boyfriend. But in her third year she was introduced to Ryan \u2013 then a talented midfielder at Tottenham. They came from the same area, and hit it off. They eventually moved in together, relocating to Hull City in 2016 after the club bought Ryan for a record \u00a313m. By the end of the year Ryan had proposed on a boat in Dubai.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ryan\u2019s skull was fractured in a collision with another player. \u2018He actually died, and they brought him back. I had a nervous breakdown\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Just a few weeks later, on 22 January 2017, Ryan suffered a life-threatening head injury at Stamford Bridge when Chelsea defender Gary Cahill rose to head the ball, missed, and smashed into the back of Ryan\u2019s head, fracturing his skull. Within an hour the then 25-year-old was being operated on at St Mary\u2019s hospital in London, his family waiting anxiously for news.</p> <p>As Rachel recalls the day of the collision, tears fall thick and fast. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019ve just never talked about it before. How can your life be so perfect and then suddenly your whole world is turned upside down? He was unresponsive. He actually died, and they brought him back. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel was at home in Hull when a message came through on her phone. Ryan\u2019s skull had been crushed by the force of the collision. He had a brain haemorrhage, a broken eye socket and a broken jaw. Fourteen metal plates were inserted into his head as the surgeons tried to piece him back together.</p> <p>When Ryan came home he could not sit up or walk. The slightest noise was excruciating to him, and the cocktail of painkillers gave him nightmares. Without any home help, Rachel was left to nurse him. \u201cHis body was traumatised. His skin was peeling off his fingertips, he had to wear white cotton gloves.\u201d She washed, fed, dressed him. How did she manage? \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking of myself,\u201d she says quietly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2693a7305773235c7671468db07283bd32e59df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2693a7305773235c7671468db07283bd32e59df/0_475_6192_7781/796.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Peters\" width=\"796\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rachel Peters\u2019 life changed dramatically when a tackle left her fiance Ryan with a fractured skull.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry Borden/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But emotionally, Ryan\u2019s rehabilitation took its toll. \u201cWhen I got home from the hospital I had a nervous breakdown. I sobbed like a baby. I couldn\u2019t cope because I was having to be so strong all the time. I felt guilty just to leave the house for a coffee.\u201d</p> <p>After three months, Ryan began to walk. The couple credit Mark Waller, the Hull club doctor, with saving his life. Ryan\u2019s former club, Tottenham, opened their doors for his rehabilitation; and Petr Cech, the Arsenal goalkeeper who suffered a head injury while playing for Chelsea in 2006, provided support. It was on Cech\u2019s advice that Ryan learned to play the piano to help retrain the neurological pathways in his brain.</p> <p>To have a playing career cut short, at 25, has been devastating for Ryan. Rachel wants eventually to go back to university to study architecture and design, but with a baby on the way, there are happy distractions. The front door goes: it\u2019s Ryan with their 14-month-old son, George. \u201cWe haven\u2019t let it change us,\u201d she says of the accident. \u201cWe are positive people, and we are so in love.\u201d</p> <p>Across the county border in a small village in Essex, I meet Steph Etherington, wife of former West Ham winger Matthew Etherington, now running her own business making children\u2019s clothes. With two young daughters she has her hands full, and couldn\u2019t make the journey to Cheshire to be photographed. Instead we sit on the sofa in her modest home as she tells me how their lives were turned upside down by Matt\u2019s gambling addiction, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1250795/Matthew-Etherington-I-blew-1-5m-gambling-kept-shame-secret-family.html\" title=\"\">when he lost \u00a31.5m in 2009.</a></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You don\u2019t just want to be \u2018the wife of\u2019 \u2013 you need to find your passion, your identity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Steph is conscious of not wanting to upset Matt by raking over old wounds, but feels it is important to warn other partners to look out for an addiction that blights young footballers. \u201cBack then I didn\u2019t even ask him about it. The best thing you can do is talk.\u201d And if they won\u2019t open up? Steph shakes her head. \u201cIf they won\u2019t open up, then I don\u2019t know. They need to want to get help.\u201d</p> <p>Football and gambling have long been linked. Former England striker Michael Owen confessed to losing up to \u00a340,000 to the bookies, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/aug/29/gordon-taylor-support-pfa-gambling\" title=\"\">even the PFA\u2019s chief executive Gordon Taylor reportedly amassed debts of \u00a3100,000</a>. Many former players describe a casual gambling culture within the game \u2013 card schools on the back of the team bus, team bonding over a bet.</p> <p>Steph says she always knew Matt liked to gamble, but didn\u2019t recognise it as a problem at first. \u201cI was only 20 when we met, I didn\u2019t know anything about life back then.\u201d Matt started gambling as a young player. Away from home, killing time in a hotel room with more money than he knew what to do with, he was introduced to the dog track by a friend. The habit spiralled when he moved to West Ham in 2003. The club tried to help by paying off his debts, but the problem was deeper than cash flow. \u201cHe\u2019d got himself in a right old state,\u201d Steph says, gently.</p> <p>When Matt moved to Stoke in 2009, his family sat him down and forced him to confront the issue. He agreed to go to football\u2019s rehabilitation clinic, <a href=\"https://www.sportingchanceclinic.com/\" title=\"\">Sporting Chance</a>. \u201cIt was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/18/peter-kay\" title=\"\">Peter Kay</a> at the clinic who saved him,\u201d says Steph. \u201cI remember he called me into his office and asked if I was OK. He said, \u2018I just want you to know that if you were to say to Matt that you\u2019re leaving him, it wouldn\u2019t make any difference. It doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t love you, it\u2019s just not as easy as that.\u2019 It was hard because there was nothing I could do.\u201d</p> <p>Steph is incredibly proud of how Matt has put his addiction behind him and forged a new life coaching the Under-18s at Peterborough. \u201cHe will always have to live with it. But he\u2019s like a different person now. He did learn his lesson. He is the happiest ever. It\u2019s just taken a few years to get there.\u201d</p> <p>As he left his gambling past behind, another challenge emerged: retirement. After playing his last game for Stoke in 2014, Matt was out of work for four years with a hefty tax bill of \u00a360,000 following investments in film schemes. Without an income the couple were forced to sell their house. \u201cWe would never have got a seven-year mortgage if we\u2019d been properly advised,\u201d she says. \u201cWe just thought, \u2018Pay it off as quickly as possible\u2019. We didn\u2019t imagine Matt would retire at 33. But we\u2019ve got our happy ending now, haven\u2019t we?\u201d She smiles. \u201cI love what Maggie and Helen are doing. It\u2019s so good for the wives to have a place where they can speak about things. Girl power.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5e86c3bc004c1044119ebce90fb72c72cac3945\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5e86c3bc004c1044119ebce90fb72c72cac3945/1020_1163_5172_6289/822.jpg\" alt=\"Amara Kanu\" width=\"822\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amara Kanu met former Arsenal striker Nwankwo in Nigeria and struggled to adapt to London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry Borden/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Amara Kanu, moving to the UK at 18 was a shock; other than her husband, she didn\u2019t know a soul. She was just 17 when they met, at an \u201cApo\u201d \u2013 a traditional dance \u2013 in the Eastern state of Abia, Nigeria. \u201cI was planning to go to university to study architecture when he courted me. He wanted to get married, but he was 10 years older than me. For 14 months we were supervised on dates. When I was 18 we got married \u2013 it was the biggest wedding Nigeria had ever seen.\u201d The marriage took place just weeks after Arsenal\u2019s Invincibles season, when the team went unbeaten throughout 2003/4. But in London, Amara struggled. \u201cThe limelight, the fast-paced life. I missed Nigeria. I wanted to cook food from home, but to get the ingredients, I had to go to Tottenham. My husband was playing for Arsenal at the time, so I put on my cap and shades and got on the bus.\u201d</p> <p>Soon she was pregnant, but at home in Hertfordshire she felt isolated. \u201cI didn\u2019t go out like other women my age. My hormones were all over the place. It could have broken me, being so alone.\u201d She credits Kolo Tour\u00e9 and Emmanuel Adebayor\u2019s wives with helping her adjust to life in the UK; the couple have since had three children together. When, in 2014, Kanu travelled to the US for heart surgery, Amara spent an agonising three months there nursing him back to health. She says she stayed sane by going to the gym, prompting her to <a href=\"https://amarakanu.com/\" title=\"\">start a business as a</a> wellness coach.</p> <p>After years as a stay-at-home mother, Jennifer Lonergan is also thrilled to be running her own business. Being able to contribute to the family finances was important to her, she says. In their 15 years of marriage, she and her husband Andrew have faced some extraordinary challenges \u2013 their eldest daughter, Millie, was born with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare metabolic condition that can cause brain damage and requires close monitoring; they also lost Jennifer\u2019s brother Anthony to suicide. But in football there is rarely time off for a new baby, or compassionate leave; instead, players are expected to be straight back on to the pitch, even after life-changing events. Last year, Jennifer climbed Mount Kilimanjaro to highlight mental health issues, raising funds for Mind, and for the Willink unit at Manchester hospital which supports children with PKU. Millie \u2013 now 12 \u2013 manages her condition with a maturity beyond her years, she says, and together with her younger sister, Grace, is a talented footballer. \u201cWe\u2019ve faced some tough times as a family, but I\u2019m so proud of how we\u2019ve managed to pull through,\u201d says Jennifer. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to talk to each other. I wanted to share my story to help other families do the same.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a494e1bde7bfd3a57130dd898c826b550674c6e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a494e1bde7bfd3a57130dd898c826b550674c6e8/0_0_6192_6525/949.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Lonergan\" width=\"949\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jennifer Lonergan, wife of footballer Andrew, runs her own successful business.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry Borden/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Leanne agrees. \u201cYou don\u2019t just want to be \u2018the wife of\u2019\u2013 you need to find your passion, your identity.\u201d She credits meditation with helping her find her equilibrium, and has spent the past year working as a patron for <a href=\"https://www.onewomanatatime.co.uk/\" title=\"\">One Woman At A Time</a>, campaigning against FGM, period poverty and domestic violence in the UK and abroad.</p> <p>Stepping outside Leanne\u2019s house, the women gather for one final photograph. Thick fog descends as they pick their way through a muddy field. The air is freezing, the light fading. The women stay close together. There is an honesty, a rawness, about their friendship. \u201cI wonder what the metaphor is?\u201d asks Helen.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWelcome to Cheshire,\u201d says the taxi driver, pulling out of Wilmslow station, \u201chome of millionaire housewives and footballers.\u201d As we drive, we pass designer boutiques, mock Tudor houses and shiny sports cars. In Cheshire\u2019s golden triangle it is easy to buy in to the stereotype of the footballer\u2019s wife. And on the surface, at least, the image rings true. Leanne Brown, formerly of the reality TV show The Real Housewives Of Cheshire and wife of former Manchester United defender Wes Brown, lives in an 11,000 sq ft mansion, complete with swimming pool, grand piano and the heady scent of Jo Malone candles. On a freezing cold morning in January, a group of women gather at her house. One by one they buzz the security gate: Amara Kanu, wife of former Arsenal striker Nwankwo Kanu and a wellness coach; Rachel Peters, fiance of former Tottenham midfielder Ryan Mason and seven months pregnant with their second child; Jennifer Lonergan, wife of Middlesbrough goalkeeper Andrew Lonergan and owner of a luxury travel company; and Erin Borini, married to AC Milan striker Fabio Borini and a model. The women congregate in the kitchen ahead of Guardian Weekend\u2019s photoshoot, doing their hair and makeup, a glamorous scene of stilettos, personalised luggage and ringlit selfies. The women want to talk about the challenges they and their partners have faced, both during and after high-profile football careers, but they choose their words cautiously. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this to be a pity piece,\u201d says Leanne, as they each stress how lucky they are to have enjoyed the benefits that come with a life in football. \u201cIt\u2019s about raising awareness for other wives and families in the industry,\u201d she adds. Helen Drury, wife of former Norwich City captain Adam Drury, and Maggie Devine-Inman, wife of former Peterborough United midfielder Niall Inman, have encouraged the women to talk to me after setting up LifeStyled Club, an online hub launched in 2015 connecting 400 wives and partners of footballers. While the players themselves can go to the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association (PFA), there is minimal support for their families. \u201cWe took inspiration from Mumsnet,\u201d explains Helen. \u201cWe wanted a source of advice for women \u2013 whether that\u2019s where to live in a new town, or how to get help if your husband has a gambling problem.\u201d Helen and Maggie met through their husbands \u2013 best friends since their football apprenticeship days at Peterborough \u2013 and are refreshingly down to earth. \u201cI\u2019m not great at the glamour part,\u201d laughs Maggie. \u201cI\u2019ve usually got wet hair when we get in the car to go to meetings, but it dries on the way.\u201d But the pair\u2019s passion for their cause has won them the trust of this largely private community. \u201cAs wives in football, we\u2019ve shared experiences that even our closest friends and family wouldn\u2019t understand,\u201d says Maggie. The average career of a professional footballer lasts just eight years, according to the PFA. Despite the riches earned in that time, a staggering 40% are declared bankrupt within five years of hanging up their boots, according to research from XPro, a charity set up by former Wimbledon striker Dean Holdsworth to support retired footballers. Poor financial advice is often the culprit. From the late 1990s, more than 130 footballers including Wayne Rooney and David Beckham invested in a number of now-notorious schemes to boost the British film industry. While some were later revealed to be fraudulent, HMRC is also clamping down on the legitimate ones, citing tax avoidance, and demanding payments over and above the original investments, sending many football families spiralling into debt. The former Premier League star Dean Windass has told how he lost his house and became suicidal when a tax bill for \u00a3164,000 landed. Even without bad investments, retirement can be a shock. Within a year, 33% of footballers get divorced, according to XPro. \u201cFor 19 years my husband was told where to be, when to go on holiday, what to eat and drink,\u201d says Helen. \u201cI would call it \u2018institutionalised\u2019. Then he retires and the phone stops ringing. The people who were around you disappear, and you\u2019re alone.\u201d Helen adds that Norwich City have been supportive, and the Drurys are grateful for their lives in football. \u201cMen are not good at talking,\u201d adds Maggie. \u201cWe\u2019ve had girls write to us about their husbands being depressed and not able to tell anyone.\u201d This month sees the launch of their LifeStyled Club: The Podcast, with BT Sport presenter Jake Humphrey, in which they hope to open up taboo many conversations. Delia Smith, Norwich\u2019s majority shareholder, has been supportive, connecting the women with football\u2019s governing bodies to pool resources and expertise. But the male-dominated industry has yet to truly back the idea. Footballers\u2019 wives haven\u2019t had the best press, and are usually subject to depressingly misogynistic tropes. \u201cWe have lived with the Wag stigma for so long,\u201d says Leanne. \u201cPeople were quick to brand me a \u2018sponger\u2019, just for being a stay-at-home mum.\u201d Leanne\u2019s upbringing, in a small village in Cumbria, was tough. Her mother worked three jobs, and her father left the family home when Leanne was 13. In her teens, Leanne ended up in a violent relationship. Meeting Wes changed her life, she says. She was a table dancer when they met at a club in Manchester. He was 18, a young star breaking into the first team at Manchester United \u2013 not that she had any inkling. They caught each other\u2019s eye. \u201cAfter a few drinks I went over and kissed him,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cI\u2019d never done anything like that before. Afterwards I said, \u2018Anyway, what\u2019s your name?\u2019\u201d She laughs. She had dreamed of being a glamour model, but Wes wasn\u2019t so sure. Instead Leanne went to college to study beauty therapy. At 26 she was pregnant with their first child, Halle, and became a stay-at-home mother. Leanne says she\u2019s doing this interview now because she wants to help other women avoid the mistakes she made. \u201cFemale empowerment,\u201d she says, firmly. \u201cAll too often, as wives, we are alienated from meetings and investments. People take advantage in every sense, charging you extortionate prices. You are manipulated into doing crap investments so others can make a few quid off the back of you.\u201d The family have lost money on poor financial advice and are currently engaged in a legal dispute with a former friend, The Real Housewives Of Cheshire star Dawn Ward, after allegedly lending her \u00a3500,000. The Browns are selling up and downsizing to a smaller property. Despite the challenges, the couple have been together 21 years. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, we\u2019ve had our tough times,\u201d says Leanne, \u201cbut I love him to bits.\u201d As we chat, Wes arrives home and helps their three daughters, Halle, 16, Lilia, 11, and Lola, 7, with their homework. \u201cHe\u2019s always been a hands-on dad,\u201d says their mother, proudly. Back in the kitchen, Erin advises the women on how to pose for the camera. \u201cPut one leg behind, and lean back like Victoria Beckham.\u201d They laugh. Erin met Fabio Borini when he signed for Liverpool, her home town. She was already earning good money as a model, her face on billboards across Europe. She says she liked Fabio\u2019s quietness. \u201cHe was going down to London on the train for the day and I said he should get a Young Person\u2019s Railcard. My friend said, \u2018Erin! He\u2019s on thousands a week, he doesn\u2019t need a third off!\u2019 But he liked that I saw him as a human being.\u201d In their six years together they\u2019ve moved house five times, most recently to Milan. All of the women have experienced this itinerant way of life: a sudden move to a new club, the wives expected to manage the logistics. At 24, Rachel is the youngest of the group. She smiles a lot, but there is a seriousness about her, too. Her life changed dramatically when her fiance, Ryan, was injured in a collision on the pitch in 2017. The memories are still raw. When we meet at her home in Hertfordshire, she settles into a sofa and describes herself as \u201ca geek, with my nose in a book\u201d (her favourite novel is War And Peace). She studied business and economics at Lancaster University, and had little interest in finding a boyfriend. But in her third year she was introduced to Ryan \u2013 then a talented midfielder at Tottenham. They came from the same area, and hit it off. They eventually moved in together, relocating to Hull City in 2016 after the club bought Ryan for a record \u00a313m. By the end of the year Ryan had proposed on a boat in Dubai. Just a few weeks later, on 22 January 2017, Ryan suffered a life-threatening head injury at Stamford Bridge when Chelsea defender Gary Cahill rose to head the ball, missed, and smashed into the back of Ryan\u2019s head, fracturing his skull. Within an hour the then 25-year-old was being operated on at St Mary\u2019s hospital in London, his family waiting anxiously for news. As Rachel recalls the day of the collision, tears fall thick and fast. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019ve just never talked about it before. How can your life be so perfect and then suddenly your whole world is turned upside down? He was unresponsive. He actually died, and they brought him back. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d Rachel was at home in Hull when a message came through on her phone. Ryan\u2019s skull had been crushed by the force of the collision. He had a brain haemorrhage, a broken eye socket and a broken jaw. Fourteen metal plates were inserted into his head as the surgeons tried to piece him back together. When Ryan came home he could not sit up or walk. The slightest noise was excruciating to him, and the cocktail of painkillers gave him nightmares. Without any home help, Rachel was left to nurse him. \u201cHis body was traumatised. His skin was peeling off his fingertips, he had to wear white cotton gloves.\u201d She washed, fed, dressed him. How did she manage? \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking of myself,\u201d she says quietly. But emotionally, Ryan\u2019s rehabilitation took its toll. \u201cWhen I got home from the hospital I had a nervous breakdown. I sobbed like a baby. I couldn\u2019t cope because I was having to be so strong all the time. I felt guilty just to leave the house for a coffee.\u201d After three months, Ryan began to walk. The couple credit Mark Waller, the Hull club doctor, with saving his life. Ryan\u2019s former club, Tottenham, opened their doors for his rehabilitation; and Petr Cech, the Arsenal goalkeeper who suffered a head injury while playing for Chelsea in 2006, provided support. It was on Cech\u2019s advice that Ryan learned to play the piano to help retrain the neurological pathways in his brain. To have a playing career cut short, at 25, has been devastating for Ryan. Rachel wants eventually to go back to university to study architecture and design, but with a baby on the way, there are happy distractions. The front door goes: it\u2019s Ryan with their 14-month-old son, George. \u201cWe haven\u2019t let it change us,\u201d she says of the accident. \u201cWe are positive people, and we are so in love.\u201d Across the county border in a small village in Essex, I meet Steph Etherington, wife of former West Ham winger Matthew Etherington, now running her own business making children\u2019s clothes. With two young daughters she has her hands full, and couldn\u2019t make the journey to Cheshire to be photographed. Instead we sit on the sofa in her modest home as she tells me how their lives were turned upside down by Matt\u2019s gambling addiction, when he lost \u00a31.5m in 2009. Steph is conscious of not wanting to upset Matt by raking over old wounds, but feels it is important to warn other partners to look out for an addiction that blights young footballers. \u201cBack then I didn\u2019t even ask him about it. The best thing you can do is talk.\u201d And if they won\u2019t open up? Steph shakes her head. \u201cIf they won\u2019t open up, then I don\u2019t know. They need to want to get help.\u201d Football and gambling have long been linked. Former England striker Michael Owen confessed to losing up to \u00a340,000 to the bookies, while even the PFA\u2019s chief executive Gordon Taylor reportedly amassed debts of \u00a3100,000. Many former players describe a casual gambling culture within the game \u2013 card schools on the back of the team bus, team bonding over a bet. Steph says she always knew Matt liked to gamble, but didn\u2019t recognise it as a problem at first. \u201cI was only 20 when we met, I didn\u2019t know anything about life back then.\u201d Matt started gambling as a young player. Away from home, killing time in a hotel room with more money than he knew what to do with, he was introduced to the dog track by a friend. The habit spiralled when he moved to West Ham in 2003. The club tried to help by paying off his debts, but the problem was deeper than cash flow. \u201cHe\u2019d got himself in a right old state,\u201d Steph says, gently. When Matt moved to Stoke in 2009, his family sat him down and forced him to confront the issue. He agreed to go to football\u2019s rehabilitation clinic, Sporting Chance. \u201cIt was Peter Kay at the clinic who saved him,\u201d says Steph. \u201cI remember he called me into his office and asked if I was OK. He said, \u2018I just want you to know that if you were to say to Matt that you\u2019re leaving him, it wouldn\u2019t make any difference. It doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t love you, it\u2019s just not as easy as that.\u2019 It was hard because there was nothing I could do.\u201d Steph is incredibly proud of how Matt has put his addiction behind him and forged a new life coaching the Under-18s at Peterborough. \u201cHe will always have to live with it. But he\u2019s like a different person now. He did learn his lesson. He is the happiest ever. It\u2019s just taken a few years to get there.\u201d As he left his gambling past behind, another challenge emerged: retirement. After playing his last game for Stoke in 2014, Matt was out of work for four years with a hefty tax bill of \u00a360,000 following investments in film schemes. Without an income the couple were forced to sell their house. \u201cWe would never have got a seven-year mortgage if we\u2019d been properly advised,\u201d she says. \u201cWe just thought, \u2018Pay it off as quickly as possible\u2019. We didn\u2019t imagine Matt would retire at 33. But we\u2019ve got our happy ending now, haven\u2019t we?\u201d She smiles. \u201cI love what Maggie and Helen are doing. It\u2019s so good for the wives to have a place where they can speak about things. Girl power.\u201d For Amara Kanu, moving to the UK at 18 was a shock; other than her husband, she didn\u2019t know a soul. She was just 17 when they met, at an \u201cApo\u201d \u2013 a traditional dance \u2013 in the Eastern state of Abia, Nigeria. \u201cI was planning to go to university to study architecture when he courted me. He wanted to get married, but he was 10 years older than me. For 14 months we were supervised on dates. When I was 18 we got married \u2013 it was the biggest wedding Nigeria had ever seen.\u201d The marriage took place just weeks after Arsenal\u2019s Invincibles season, when the team went unbeaten throughout 2003/4. But in London, Amara struggled. \u201cThe limelight, the fast-paced life. I missed Nigeria. I wanted to cook food from home, but to get the ingredients, I had to go to Tottenham. My husband was playing for Arsenal at the time, so I put on my cap and shades and got on the bus.\u201d Soon she was pregnant, but at home in Hertfordshire she felt isolated. \u201cI didn\u2019t go out like other women my age. My hormones were all over the place. It could have broken me, being so alone.\u201d She credits Kolo Tour\u00e9 and Emmanuel Adebayor\u2019s wives with helping her adjust to life in the UK; the couple have since had three children together. When, in 2014, Kanu travelled to the US for heart surgery, Amara spent an agonising three months there nursing him back to health. She says she stayed sane by going to the gym, prompting her to start a business as a wellness coach. After years as a stay-at-home mother, Jennifer Lonergan is also thrilled to be running her own business. Being able to contribute to the family finances was important to her, she says. In their 15 years of marriage, she and her husband Andrew have faced some extraordinary challenges \u2013 their eldest daughter, Millie, was born with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare metabolic condition that can cause brain damage and requires close monitoring; they also lost Jennifer\u2019s brother Anthony to suicide. But in football there is rarely time off for a new baby, or compassionate leave; instead, players are expected to be straight back on to the pitch, even after life-changing events. Last year, Jennifer climbed Mount Kilimanjaro to highlight mental health issues, raising funds for Mind, and for the Willink unit at Manchester hospital which supports children with PKU. Millie \u2013 now 12 \u2013 manages her condition with a maturity beyond her years, she says, and together with her younger sister, Grace, is a talented footballer. \u201cWe\u2019ve faced some tough times as a family, but I\u2019m so proud of how we\u2019ve managed to pull through,\u201d says Jennifer. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to talk to each other. I wanted to share my story to help other families do the same.\u201d Leanne agrees. \u201cYou don\u2019t just want to be \u2018the wife of\u2019\u2013 you need to find your passion, your identity.\u201d She credits meditation with helping her find her equilibrium, and has spent the past year working as a patron for One Woman At A Time, campaigning against FGM, period poverty and domestic violence in the UK and abroad. Stepping outside Leanne\u2019s house, the women gather for one final photograph. Thick fog descends as they pick their way through a muddy field. The air is freezing, the light fading. The women stay close together. There is an honesty, a rawness, about their friendship. \u201cI wonder what the metaphor is?\u201d asks Helen. Something like, in the fog, everyone needs a hand to hold. \u2022 If you would like to make a comment on this piece, and be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).

New clubs, new players and a new competition style \u2013 there\u2019s a lot to look forward to.</p> <p>This evening, Collingwood and one of the new clubs to join the competition this year, Geelong, have the honour of getting the season underway, on their home turf and in front of strong local support. </p> <p>The first games of seasons one and two have been previously contested between Collingwood and Carlton, but the AFL have decided to mix things up this season \u2013 and that\u2019s not the only change.</p> <p>Season three has already got off to a controversial start, thanks to the AFLW\u2019s decision to convert to two conference-style rounds. There will also be three cross-conference games played; with two new clubs this year, it essentially means that less rounds will be played and finals will be condensed into two weeks. </p> <p>Later tonight, game two \u2013 between the Crows and reigning premiers the Bulldogs \u2013 starts at 8.40pm AEDT, at Norwood Oval in South Australia. More on that later. <br></p> <p>In the meantime, feel free to shoot me an email on alana.schetzer.freelance@theguardian.com or tweet your thoughts to @schetzer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/01/challenges-await-aflw-but-new-firsts-inspire-third-season-optimism\">Challenges await AFLW but new 'firsts' inspire third season optimism</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-02T07:14:50.394Z\">at 7.14am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

A win is a win though, and it\u2019s a good start to the reigning premiers\u2019 title defence. It\u2019s also the first win for the Bulldogs over the Crows, ever. Adelaide put their muscle into the game in the dying seconds and looked set to grab a fairy-tale win but their kick at goal swung wide. Adelaide may not have won but they proved that they have it in them to control the game, they just need to convert that control into goals. No doubt that will be on their minds all week. The official crowd is in and 7,830 have attended tonight\u2019s game. Thanks for your company tonight. 4th quarter, 5:32 remaining: Bulldogs 2.5 (17) to Crows 1.10 (16) This is a nail-biter! We\u2019re only five minutes until the end and the score has only shifted by one point, a behind to the Bulldogs. They\u2019re now one point in front, and really, one point is all that matters as long as you\u2019re in front. But both teams are getting scrappy and are determined to control that ball. Start of 4th quarter: Bulldogs 2.4 (16) to Crows 1.10 (16) We kick off the final quarter with teams tied at 16 points. This game is truly anyone\u2019s. Both teams have struggled to place a stake in this game. It\u2019s a disappointment, given the anticipation for the 2018 premiers to take on the 2017 premiers. We have one more quarter to go, and we\u2019re hoping for some high energy and strong disposals. It\u2019s important to note that Adelaide, where the game is being played, is still a highly unpleasant 30C, which does make it hard for all players. 3rd quarter, 2:21 remaining: Bulldogs 2.4 (16) to Crows 1.10 (16) Like the Pies-Cats game earlier this evening, this is a close contest. Yet another behind to the Crows brings both teams level at 16 points apiece. 3rd quarter, 5:57 remaining: Bulldogs 2.4 (16) to Crows 1.8 (14) The Bulldogs starts where they left off in the second quarter, but add a behind, not a goal, this time. There are still a fair few errors slipping through from both sides. Half way through the quarter, Phillips grabs a behind, continuing the Crows goal-drought. Start of 3rd quarter: Bulldogs 2.3 (15) to Crows 1.7 (13) We head into the third quarter without a clear idea of who\u2019s game this really is. The Bulldogs are winning on the scoreboard, although it\u2019s been the Crows that have been extending the most energy on the ground. Goal! And another! A late goal to the Bulldogs brings them back into the game, which is followed quickly by another to Katie Brennan. The Bulldogs finish the quarter two in front and with more than a fighting chance for the second half. Adelaide dominated most of the game but choked at the goal posts five times. That wasn\u2019t much of a problem while the Bulldogs failed to bark but now that Brennan has become the preverbal jaws of life, the Crows will need to use this half-time break and figure out a new plan if they want to nab a win. 2nd quarter, 3:14 remaining: Bulldogs 0.2 (2) to Crows 1.6 (12) Adelaide add another point but they\u2019ll be mighty frustrated with making mush of five opportunities at goal in a row. 2nd quarter, 6:24 remaining: Bulldogs 0.2 (2) to Crows 1.5 (11) Adelaide are doing good work this quarter but wasting all of their opportunities \u2013 five misses at goal means that they\u2019ve added just four to their tally. They\u2019re getting the ball but failing to do anything with it. 2nd quarter, 9:34 remaining: Bulldogs 0.2 (2) to Crows 1.4 (10) A fair bit of congested play at the sides, with both teams putting their muscle into clearing a path to their forwards. A beautiful mark from the Crows\u2019 Chelsea Randall adds some colour to this quarter. Start of 2nd quarter: Bulldogs 0.2 (2) to Crows 1.1 (7) Welcome to the second quarter. Adelaide are five points up but neither team has grabbed dominance of the ball yet. Goal! Adelaide\u2019s Chloe Scheer saves the quarter by kicking a straight goal in the last minute \u2013 her first ever and the first for the Crows this season. Other than that though, it\u2019s been a quiet quarter on the scoreboard, but there has been some gutsy play on the ground. Adelaide sweltered through 37C heat today and it\u2019s still a sticky 34C right now \u2013 not a great environment for a game of footy. 1st quarter, 3:01 remaining: Bulldogs 0.2 (2) to Crows 0.0 (0) Adelaide\u2019s Erin Phillips almost grabs a behind with an incredible twisty kick but it bounces back into the play. She\u2019s looking strong and determined, though, and looks like she might do some damage this game. 1st quarter, 7:32 remaining: Bulldogs 0.2 (2) to Crows 0.0 (0) Adelaide are putting a lot of pressure on the Bulldogs but they\u2019re not getting the ball into their forward enough. The Bulldogs nick another point. 1st quarter, 9:35 remaining: Bulldogs 0.1 (1) to Crows 0.0 (0) The Bulldogs start briskly and put a lot of energy into getting the ball to the forward. They put a quick point on the board. Adelaide Crows v Western Bulldogs: Game two of the first round is set to kick off. This time, we have the 2018 premiers \u2013 the Bulldogs \u2013 taking on the inaugural premiers, the Crows. Despite their success, both teams have had their fair share of lows, too. Adelaide struggled in season two, while the Bulldogs came close to grabbing the wooden spoon in season one. Adelaide have a strong side to take into season three, including the formidable Erin Phillips, plus co-captain Chelsea Randall, who grabs disposals the way someone with the flu grabs tissues. Over at the Bulldogs, they\u2019ll be wanting to hang onto their winning streak, and plenty of eyes will be on Isabel Huntington, both for her talent but also on her return, after she tore her ACL last year. Congratulations to Geelong for winning their first AFLW match! It was a rough, desperate contest for much of the game and even though they started off quietly in the first quarter, they gained their confidence \u2013 and the ball \u2013 and set themselves up strongly for the rest of the game. Geelong\u2019s defence put on a good show, while it was Collingwood\u2019s forwards that kept them in control for much of the game. But despite a last-minute attempt at goal, the Pies couldn\u2019t bring it home. They\u2019ll be especially disappointed as it means for the third consecutive year, they\u2019ve failed to win their round one match. 4th quarter, 1:58 remaining: Collingwood 3.5 (23) to Geelong 3.6 (24) Nina Morrison! The No 1 draft pick has the whole crowd silently biting their nails as she takes a short drop punt for goal but hits the post! Still, that puts the Cats ahead. At this point, every point counts. 4th quarter, 4:02 remaining: Collingwood 3.5 (23) to Geelong 3.5 (23) Fatigue has settled in across both sides but there have still been some long kicks. What we\u2019re missing is those strong tackles from Geelong or that forward power from Collingwood. 4th quarter, 6:02 remaining: Collingwood 3.5 (23) to Geelong 3.5 (23) Great mark by the Pies but no change to the score. It\u2019s a rather scrappy quarter, with both teams desperate to get the ball to their end of the ground but neither able to do so. Collingwood has a chance at goal, or a point, at the 6:50 mark but neither was taken. We\u2019re still tied at 23 points each. Tonight\u2019s crowd is a healthy 18,429. It\u2019s not quite the 20,000 that AFL were expecting but that\u2019s a still a great show of loyalty to the Cats for their first AFLW game. 4th quarter, 12:23 remaining: Collingwood 3.5 (23) to Geelong 3.5 (23) The scores are now even, with both teams sitting on 23 points. Geelong\u2019s Jordan Ivey goes for goal but has to settle for a point. The crowd, which was getting loud, gets notably quieter. The fourth quarter is on and both sides have a win in their sights. There\u2019s just a single point in it. Well, that escalated suddenly. The third quarter was looking to be a bit of a fizzer for both teams, but then Collingwood got on the board in the last few minutes, with Lambert and D\u2019Arcy each kicking a goal. The Cats could only respond with a point. It\u2019s now a tight contest, with just one point between them. Goal! Collingwood 3.5 (23) to Geelong 3.4 (22) In what may be the funniest goal we\u2019ll see this season, the Pies\u2019 Jamiee Lambert scores her first goal of the game \u2013 that she clearly didn\u2019t think would be a goal. She kicks straight but low and it somehow converts itself from its fate as a behind to a goal. Lambert only just came back onto the ground after that ankle scare, so it\u2019s been a big quarter for her. Collingwood are now back in front by one point. Despite the first goals of the quarter going to Collingwood, there isn\u2019t the dominance from either team that we saw in the first two quarters. 3rd quarter, 9:52 remaining: Collingwood 2.4 (16) to Geelong 3.2 (20) We have a case of deja vu, as Collingwood kick off the third quarter with a goal, just as they did in the first. Does this mean that Geelong will go quiet this quarter but then end the fourth quarter on a high? Another injury, this time to Collingwood\u2019s Jaimee Lambert, who has a problem with her leg. She hobbles off the ground to the sidelines. Reports coming in that it\u2019s her right ankle. Goal! Collingwood 2.4 (16) to Geelong 3.2 (20) Collingwood seem to have recovered their mojo, with Sarah D\u2019Arcy taking a clear shot for goal and nailing it. Just a few seconds in and Geelong\u2019s Sophie Alexander is on the ground, with a possible concussion. Medics are on the scene and play is delayed for six minutes. Lauren Butler comes on to replace D\u2019Arcy, who is taken off the ground on a stretcher to the cheers and respect of the crowd. 3rd quarter, 14:48 remaining: Collingwood 1.3 (9) to Geelong 3.2 (20) We\u2019ve had two quarters and two shifts of power, with the Pies dominating the first quarter but the Cats taking control in the second quarter. Geelong have clearly settled into the game and that change has in turn shaken up the Pies. Geelong are leading on disposals. Goal, goal, goal! That\u2019s three goals to Geelong, with Maddy Boyd grabbing her second goal within a matter of minutes. The Cats have been rejuvenated this quarter, while the Pies have lost that edge they displayed in the first quarter. 2nd quarter, 1:28 remaining: Collingwood 1.3 (9) to Geelong 2.2 (14) Collingwood have been unable to answer Geelong\u2019s back-to-back goals. Also, someone on Twitter has criticised the use of a yellow ball when the sun is still strong. Do they have a point? Goal! Collingwood 1.2 (9) to Geelong 2.2 (14) 2nd quarter, 5.11 remaining: Mia-Rae Clifford breaks the score drought this quarter and draws some reward for all the work Geelong has done, as she puts her club in front for the first time. 2nd quarter, 8:15 remaining: Collingwood 1.2 (9) to Geelong 1.2 (8) A couple of strong tackles from the Cats have forced the Pies to pause somewhat but the Cats still need to turn that advantage into to re-gaining the ball and controlling the game from their side. 2nd quarter, 12:59 remaining: Collingwood 1.3 (9) to Geelong 1.2 (8) Geelong are getting more aggressive with the ball, as they need to gain control from the centre if they\u2019re to get more numbers on the scoreboard. 2nd quarter: Collingwood 1.3 (9) to Geelong 1.2 (8) We\u2019re into the second quarter and both teams will be wanting to shake off any nerves and take control of the game. Remember, Collingwood have never won a round one match and Geelong will be wanting to win their first AFLW game, so plenty is on the line tonight. The score may be low, but it doesn\u2019t reflect the excitement of this first quarter. Collingwood have dominated, especially in the 50 metre pocket but Geelong stayed confident and with just over a minute left, rewarded their fans with their first-ever goal for the AFLW. Goal! Collingwood 1.2 (9) to Geelong 6.0 (6) First quarter, 1:24 remaining: Geelong have kicked their first goal in the AFLW and it is met with the purr of approval from the home crowd. Maddie Boyd, a local who grew up only a few minutes away from the Cats\u2019 home ground, makes history with that kick. Collingwood 1.1 (8) to Geelong 0.0 (0) Geelong will be relieved that an attempt at goal from 30 metres for Collingwood only ends in a point. Collingwood 01.01 (7) to Geelong 00.00 (0) Collingwood have set the challenge to Geelong so far, but the Cats look confident and have displayed some impressive play \u2013 they just need to control the ball and hold the Pies back. GOAL! Collingwood 1.1 (7) to Geelong 0.0 (0) Jaimee Lambert, who delivered the Pies that first point, takes a fresh mark and kicks strongly to Sophie Alexander and she takes it 49 metres to deliver the game\u2019s first goal! Collingwood won the toss, and as they\u2019ve never won a round one game, they\u2019ll be hoping it brings them some luck. And we\u2019re off! Lots of energy in the centre although the ball proves slippery to grab. The Pies get the ball to their end and Collingwood make their mark on the scoreboard with a point. This game will be an interesting one, as North Melbourne went to town on the Pies\u2019 playing list, recruiting some of the club\u2019s strongest players \u2013 Jess Duffin, Jasmine Garner, Emma King and Mo Hope. The Pies will also be without Chloe Molloy, a best and fairest winner, who has been ruled out for the whole season due to injury. Collingwood haven\u2019t let the loss of some of their stars get them down for too long; they\u2019ve taken on some fresh talent, all aged 20 or under (Jordyn Allen, Katie Lynch, Mikala Cann, Lauren Butler and Georgia Gourlay) and show real promise to help rebuild the team. Like North, Geelong also took their cues from another club\u2019s existing team \u2013 in this case, Melbourne \u2013 and they\u2019ve recruited strongly while also bring in a number of local players Geelong may be the new kids on the block, but they bring with them plenty of success from the VFLW; they played in last year\u2019s grand final. Here are the teams who kick off season three GEELONG B: A.Teague 40, R.Goring (c) 44, C.Blakeway 4 HB: D.Taylor 28, M.McDonald 11, R.Webster 21 C: R.Garing 12 HF: S.Van De Heuvel 27, M.Boyd 26, N.Morrison 9 F: K.Darby 8, G.Rankin, J.Ivey 5 Foll: A.O\u2019Connor 14, J.Crockett-Grills 6, O.Purcell 16 I/C: D.Orr 2, M.Keryk 45, M.McMahon 24, M.Fogas 13, M.Clifford 7 Emg: G.Rankin 10, R.Caris 1 COLLINGWOOD B: J.Allen 6, A.Brazill 10, I.Ross 21 HB: S.Livingstone 12, S.Casey 22, E.Grant 5 C: B.Bonnici 8 HF: L.Butler 23 , S.D\u2019Arcy 4, M.Cann 25 F: S.Rowe 7, S.Alexander 24, C.McIntosh 20 Foll: S.Layton 1, S.Chiocci (c), 17, J.Lambert 13 I/C: R.Schleicher 18, G.Gourlay 32, S.Dargan 46, K.Stratton 41, E.Fowler 15 Emg: H.Whitford 28, K.Lynch 16 The Cats have just run out onto Kardinia Park for the very first time and the crowd are showing their approval. We\u2019ll find out later on crowd numbers but officials are hoping for 20,000 people. The new conference-style competition The AFLW is confident that the new conference-style competition is a sign of innovation, but there are plenty who aren\u2019t convinced. Check out this piece from last year to catch up on what the new style means: Welcome to the season three of AFLW! New clubs, new players and a new competition style \u2013 there\u2019s a lot to look forward to. This evening, Collingwood and one of the new clubs to join the competition this year, Geelong, have the honour of getting the season underway, on their home turf and in front of strong local support. The first games of seasons one and two have been previously contested between Collingwood and Carlton, but the AFL have decided to mix things up this season \u2013 and that\u2019s not the only change. Season three has already got off to a controversial start, thanks to the AFLW\u2019s decision to convert to two conference-style rounds. There will also be three cross-conference games played; with two new clubs this year, it essentially means that less rounds will be played and finals will be condensed into two weeks. Later tonight, game two \u2013 between the Crows and reigning premiers the Bulldogs \u2013 starts at 8.40pm AEDT, at Norwood Oval in South Australia. More on that later.

A fixture of Fox\u2019s primetime lineup, Carlson has been a gleeful scourge of liberals, a tireless disparager of social programs and a fierce critic of immigration. After he said in December that immigrants made America <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/dec/18/tucker-carlson-immigrants-poorer-dirtier-advertisers-pull-out\">\u201cpoorer and dirtier\u201d</a>, more than two dozen companies dropped their ads from his show.

      "bodyText": "Last month, Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host, delivered a bombshell 15-minute monologue in which he denounced market capitalism, Wall Street exploitation, private equity, payday loan outlets and America\u2019s ruling class. In a follow-up interview, he even said he would consider voting for Elizabeth Warren. Ever since, he has been pounded from both left and right. The Limits of Tucker Carlson\u2019s Anti-Free Market Vision, declared a headline in Slate. Tucker Carlson\u2019s Monologue Insults His Viewers, ran a title line in the Atlantic. In National Review, David French urged the right to reject Carlson\u2019s \u201cvictimhood populism\u201d, while Bret Stephens in the New York Times mocked him for questioning elite rule when he himself has so benefited from it. The uproar reflected the messenger as much as the message. A fixture of Fox\u2019s primetime lineup, Carlson has been a gleeful scourge of liberals, a tireless disparager of social programs and a fierce critic of immigration. After he said in December that immigrants made America \u201cpoorer and dirtier\u201d, more than two dozen companies dropped their ads from his show. In his jeremiad, however, Carlson sounded like Bernie Sanders. \u201cFor generations,\u201d he declared, \u201cRepublicans have considered it their duty to make the world safe for banking while simultaneously prosecuting ever more foreign wars.\u201d Americans \u201care ruled by mercenaries who feel no long-term obligation to the people they rule\u201d. In a rousing peroration, Carlson noted that Americans want to live in a country \u201cwhose leaders don\u2019t accelerate the forces of change purely for their own profit and amusement\u201d and at the expense of the family \u2013 the foundation of a healthy society. Republicans had to acknowledge that market capitalism is not a religion but a tool like a toaster or staple gun, which it would be foolish to worship.

      "body": "<p>For as long as we have loved apples (and that\u2019s a very long time) we have been taking cuttings of them. There\u2019s a legend that the earliest apple cuttings were pierced into their own apples so they could be carried along trade routes moist enough to be planted up farther down the line.</p> <p>We owe thanks to the Romans for our love of apples and the skill to graft them. All apple trees are grafted because apples don\u2019t come true from seed: if you want to ensure a cultivar, you have to take a cutting. Grafting is the process by which you take a cutting from an apple variety that you like and graft it on to a desirable rootstock with a certain vigour (or lack of, in case of dwarfing variety) and resilience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f84724d479ec891bc54d1ea01f11c70a0e28026\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f84724d479ec891bc54d1ea01f11c70a0e28026/0_11_4320_2593/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Slicing branch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not an easy skill \u2013 it takes patience and practice to slice one bit of wood so precisely that it will marry up to another bit and join forces. It is not something you can learn from text, you have to be taught in person. Which is why I am not going to even start to explain here, other than to say that, although it takes time to master this tradition, the knowledge can be picked up in an afternoon. It is possible your first lesson can give you a tree that will last a lifetime. Now is the moment to master it, because grafting has to be done in the latter half of winter, while the tree is dormant, but not long before the sap will rise again. Once you\u2019ve garnered the skill, grafting is a cheap way to produce trees. Rootstock and scion wood (the cutting) are sold for about \u00a32.50 each. Many community orchards offer scion wood for free (it\u2019s being pruned off anyway).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"702eac1716c065c112a0f9a0c12acc1dbdc34df5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/702eac1716c065c112a0f9a0c12acc1dbdc34df5/0_623_2912_1747/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elstar\u2019 and \u2018James Grieve\u2019 grafted on to one rootstock.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elstar\u2019 and \u2018James Grieve\u2019 grafted on to one rootstock.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gap Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The other great trick with grafting is to take an existing tree that is healthy, but not necessarily young, and graft on to it other varieties. This is known as a family tree and it\u2019s possible to have numerous apple varieties on a single tree. You could take that cooker at the end of the garden and add a dessert apple to it; if your tree is big enough, it might be possible to have a whole suite of different apple cultivars. I\u2019ve seen a tree with more than 250 different varieties, the branches laden with every size and manner of apples.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/26/how-to-get-your-garden-ready-for-march\">How to get your garden ready for March | Alys Fowler</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But this all starts with being able to take a sharp knife and make a good slice \u2013 and for that you need a teacher.

      "bodyText": "For as long as we have loved apples (and that\u2019s a very long time) we have been taking cuttings of them. There\u2019s a legend that the earliest apple cuttings were pierced into their own apples so they could be carried along trade routes moist enough to be planted up farther down the line. We owe thanks to the Romans for our love of apples and the skill to graft them. All apple trees are grafted because apples don\u2019t come true from seed: if you want to ensure a cultivar, you have to take a cutting. Grafting is the process by which you take a cutting from an apple variety that you like and graft it on to a desirable rootstock with a certain vigour (or lack of, in case of dwarfing variety) and resilience. It\u2019s not an easy skill \u2013 it takes patience and practice to slice one bit of wood so precisely that it will marry up to another bit and join forces. It is not something you can learn from text, you have to be taught in person. Which is why I am not going to even start to explain here, other than to say that, although it takes time to master this tradition, the knowledge can be picked up in an afternoon. It is possible your first lesson can give you a tree that will last a lifetime. Now is the moment to master it, because grafting has to be done in the latter half of winter, while the tree is dormant, but not long before the sap will rise again. Once you\u2019ve garnered the skill, grafting is a cheap way to produce trees. Rootstock and scion wood (the cutting) are sold for about \u00a32.50 each. Many community orchards offer scion wood for free (it\u2019s being pruned off anyway). The other great trick with grafting is to take an existing tree that is healthy, but not necessarily young, and graft on to it other varieties. This is known as a family tree and it\u2019s possible to have numerous apple varieties on a single tree. You could take that cooker at the end of the garden and add a dessert apple to it; if your tree is big enough, it might be possible to have a whole suite of different apple cultivars. I\u2019ve seen a tree with more than 250 different varieties, the branches laden with every size and manner of apples. But this all starts with being able to take a sharp knife and make a good slice \u2013 and for that you need a teacher. Look online for your nearest course (search apple-grafting course UK): they are offered all over the country in community gardens, orchards, public gardens and fruit nurseries (Brogdale in Kent, home of the national fruit collection; the Orchard Project nationwide; or Beardsworths Nursery in West Yorkshire). Courses tend to be held between February and March. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 February 2019 because the original referred to the Orchard Project as a London organisation whereas it has several locations.",

The development has sparked concerns that parents deliberately choosing not to vaccinate their children \u2013 out of scientifically unfounded concerns that vaccinations can harm them \u2013 are leading to epidemics that could easily be avoided. Washington governor Jay Inslee recently declared a state of emergency in response to a growing number of measles cases in the city of Vancouver, which lies within Clark county in the south of the state. By 29 January, Clark county public health (CCPH) had identified 36 confirmed cases of measles and 12 suspected cases. Twenty-five cases involved children under 10, 32 of those affected had not been immunized, and the remaining four had an unconfirmed vaccination status. CCPH also listed a range of exposure sites including schools, health centers and restaurants. Prominent among the sites were a number of Vancouver-area evangelical churches and Christian academies. Across the Columbia River in Portland, Oregon, one confirmed case had been identified by 29 January. Exposure sites there included a church; the Moda Center, where the Portland Trailblazers play NBA games; and the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, an attraction which is popular with the city\u2019s children.

In 1998, since discredited physician Andrew Wakefield published fraudulent research in the Lancet which suggested that the vaccine had a role in causing autism. A range of physicians and medical authorities have directly attributed a subsequent decline in vaccinations in many parts of the western world to the publication of Wakefield\u2019s material, which has led to a belief that there is a connection between vaccines and autism. Wakefield is revered by many in the anti-vaccination movement, which appears to be growing. Now living in the US, he has spoken to gatherings of alternative health practitioners, and in 2016 directed an anti-vaccination propaganda film.

      "body": "<p>Time \u2013 what it is, how it shifts, what happens when we lose our grip on it \u2013 is at the heart of Lavinia Greenlaw\u2019s new collection. The first section describes, in snatched, harrowing glimpses, her father\u2019s descent into dementia, a state in which the present is the only available tense; in the second, her grief, which is a function of memory, plunges her into the fourth dimension. In both halves, there\u2019s a subtlety and an intellectual curiosity to Greenlaw\u2019s interrogation of this most fundamental subject that belies the wrench and rawness of the material: through her use of form, micro and macro, she manages to exemplify both her father\u2019s experience of time and her own.</p> <p>The poems, short and desolate, capture discrete, disconnected moments: their titles (\u201cMy father appears\u201d, \u201cMy father\u2019s weakness\u201d, \u201cMy father rises whenever\u201d, \u201cMy father tells me to wait\u201d) amplify the sense of a man who has shattered into pieces, and is unable to put himself back together. But by building these poems one on top of the other into a coherent whole, Greenlaw overlays his fractured present with her own narrative sense of past and future. Through this collection, she is reconstructing his fragmented history by incorporating it into her own.</p> <p>It is a painful process. As her father loses his grasp of the past (in one striking image she likens his disintegrating mind to a flooded hold in which \u201cthe cargo\u2019s afloat / and the crane\u2019s hook swings to and fro / grabbing whatever is bumped within reach\u201d), she is forced to step forward and fill in the gaps \u2013 and in doing so confront memories of her own that she would, perhaps, rather forget. The picture that emerges is one of a man who was clever, self-absorbed (\u201cNow and then he appeared / with a bunch of tired flowers / wanting to talk of his enemies\u201d), disengaged (\u201cAll we could do was line up to watch you disappear\u201d); the irony, to which Greenlaw is richly alive, is that it is only now that he has taken leave of himself that she finally has full access to him. \u201cHe has been returned to me,\u201d she says, \u201cand now is my chance to love him.\u201d</p> <p>And in this new, edgeless reality that they are inhabiting together, she finds a man who is unexpectedly easy to love. Removed from the roar and rush of time\u2019s river, her father is tranquil and becalmed: she encounters a new version of him, with \u201cone mood and it is sweetness\u201d. While she herself remains in thrall to time, painfully aware of the losses that dementia exacts, one of the collection\u2019s revelations is that hers is only one experience of it. In \u201cHis freedom\u201d, she describes, with something close to wonder, a man who \u201cblesses the sound of pigeons and children / and loves us all\u201d. \u201cI thought I was guarding him from a crowded darkness,\u201d she says, \u201cbut now he stands free, locked into brightness.\u201d</p> <p>But if it\u2019s possible to recast her father\u2019s experience of dementia as a process of sloughing off, of unburdening, for Greenlaw it remains an anguished series of losses: of the prickly, difficult father she knew, of his apprehension of her (\u201cwhen I leave he will not know that I have been\u201d), and finally, completely, of the man himself at the moment of his death. In the second section she attempts to accommodate her grief, and the awareness that her father\u2019s death brings with it of the losses that pile up as we age. Freed from the remorseless focus of her father\u2019s final days, these poems range widely, taking in everything from first loves to working days, but always return, as if by compulsion, to the question of time. \u201cTime is not place,\u201d she says in the title poem. \u201cWe cannot build on it / but still we think the process is good for us and seek it out.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022<em> The Built Moment </em>is published by Faber (\u00a314.99).

      "bodyText": "Time \u2013 what it is, how it shifts, what happens when we lose our grip on it \u2013 is at the heart of Lavinia Greenlaw\u2019s new collection. The first section describes, in snatched, harrowing glimpses, her father\u2019s descent into dementia, a state in which the present is the only available tense; in the second, her grief, which is a function of memory, plunges her into the fourth dimension. In both halves, there\u2019s a subtlety and an intellectual curiosity to Greenlaw\u2019s interrogation of this most fundamental subject that belies the wrench and rawness of the material: through her use of form, micro and macro, she manages to exemplify both her father\u2019s experience of time and her own. The poems, short and desolate, capture discrete, disconnected moments: their titles (\u201cMy father appears\u201d, \u201cMy father\u2019s weakness\u201d, \u201cMy father rises whenever\u201d, \u201cMy father tells me to wait\u201d) amplify the sense of a man who has shattered into pieces, and is unable to put himself back together. But by building these poems one on top of the other into a coherent whole, Greenlaw overlays his fractured present with her own narrative sense of past and future. Through this collection, she is reconstructing his fragmented history by incorporating it into her own. It is a painful process. As her father loses his grasp of the past (in one striking image she likens his disintegrating mind to a flooded hold in which \u201cthe cargo\u2019s afloat / and the crane\u2019s hook swings to and fro / grabbing whatever is bumped within reach\u201d), she is forced to step forward and fill in the gaps \u2013 and in doing so confront memories of her own that she would, perhaps, rather forget. The picture that emerges is one of a man who was clever, self-absorbed (\u201cNow and then he appeared / with a bunch of tired flowers / wanting to talk of his enemies\u201d), disengaged (\u201cAll we could do was line up to watch you disappear\u201d); the irony, to which Greenlaw is richly alive, is that it is only now that he has taken leave of himself that she finally has full access to him. \u201cHe has been returned to me,\u201d she says, \u201cand now is my chance to love him.\u201d And in this new, edgeless reality that they are inhabiting together, she finds a man who is unexpectedly easy to love. Removed from the roar and rush of time\u2019s river, her father is tranquil and becalmed: she encounters a new version of him, with \u201cone mood and it is sweetness\u201d. While she herself remains in thrall to time, painfully aware of the losses that dementia exacts, one of the collection\u2019s revelations is that hers is only one experience of it. In \u201cHis freedom\u201d, she describes, with something close to wonder, a man who \u201cblesses the sound of pigeons and children / and loves us all\u201d. \u201cI thought I was guarding him from a crowded darkness,\u201d she says, \u201cbut now he stands free, locked into brightness.\u201d But if it\u2019s possible to recast her father\u2019s experience of dementia as a process of sloughing off, of unburdening, for Greenlaw it remains an anguished series of losses: of the prickly, difficult father she knew, of his apprehension of her (\u201cwhen I leave he will not know that I have been\u201d), and finally, completely, of the man himself at the moment of his death. In the second section she attempts to accommodate her grief, and the awareness that her father\u2019s death brings with it of the losses that pile up as we age. Freed from the remorseless focus of her father\u2019s final days, these poems range widely, taking in everything from first loves to working days, but always return, as if by compulsion, to the question of time. \u201cTime is not place,\u201d she says in the title poem. \u201cWe cannot build on it / but still we think the process is good for us and seek it out.\u201d \u2022 The Built Moment is published by Faber (\u00a314.99).

There is also the mystery of stagnant wages. Even as jobs were added, the one thing that remained mostly the same for large part of those 100 months were the wages. In December, wages were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/04/us-jobs-report-latest-december-beats-expectations\">up 3.2% from a year earlier</a>, their largest gain since 2008 but nothing to boast about.

Central government will pay 75% of the costs and the rest will be met by Birmingham city council and other local partners. It has been estimated that the village alone will cost \u00a3523m, with the government committed to contributing \u00a3165m of that. The village will be turned into 1,400 new homes for Perry Barr after the athletes have left.</p> <p>There has been talk of introducing airport and hotel taxes and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/09/territorial-injustice-on-rise-england-due-to-council-cuts-study\">using money from business rates</a> to cover the costs, but the council emphasises that nothing has been set in stone.</p> <p>Ian Ward, the leader of Birmingham city council, said: \u201cOne of the core strengths of our bid was that 95% of venues are already in place. There will be no white elephants and the games are helping accelerate plans that were already being shaped to regenerate the city and to improve its infrastructure for citizens, businesses and visitors. The city council is determined that the funding mechanisms it is exploring should not impact day-to-day services and that the investment in the games should not come from council tax.\u201d</p> <p>Opposition parties in Labour-controlled Birmingham back the concept of the games, but want more detail about how they will be funded.</p> <p>Tory councillor Meirion Jenkins, the local shadow cabinet member for finance and resources, said: \u201cIf Birmingham is to be regarded as a leading international city, then we must be able to stage major international events of this type. That said, I have a number of concerns about the way in which the Labour administration is failing to be straightforward with council tax payers. Having decided to host the games, we have to recognise that there will be substantial costs, part of which will need to be funded by the city.\u201d</p> <p>Jon Hunt, the leader of the Liberal Democrat group on the city council and a Perry Barr councillor, added: \u201cIt could be good but we have to make sure it\u2019s good. We have challenges to make sure the games don\u2019t do harm. I think people are cautiously optimistic.\u201d</p>",

But the council has yet to explain how it will foot the bill for the games, which were awarded to Birmingham after Durban ran into financial problems. The figure most often used \u2013 not an official one \u2013 is that it will cost \u00a3750m to host the 11-day event. Central government will pay 75% of the costs and the rest will be met by Birmingham city council and other local partners. It has been estimated that the village alone will cost \u00a3523m, with the government committed to contributing \u00a3165m of that. The village will be turned into 1,400 new homes for Perry Barr after the athletes have left. There has been talk of introducing airport and hotel taxes and using money from business rates to cover the costs, but the council emphasises that nothing has been set in stone. Ian Ward, the leader of Birmingham city council, said: \u201cOne of the core strengths of our bid was that 95% of venues are already in place. There will be no white elephants and the games are helping accelerate plans that were already being shaped to regenerate the city and to improve its infrastructure for citizens, businesses and visitors. The city council is determined that the funding mechanisms it is exploring should not impact day-to-day services and that the investment in the games should not come from council tax.\u201d Opposition parties in Labour-controlled Birmingham back the concept of the games, but want more detail about how they will be funded. Tory councillor Meirion Jenkins, the local shadow cabinet member for finance and resources, said: \u201cIf Birmingham is to be regarded as a leading international city, then we must be able to stage major international events of this type. That said, I have a number of concerns about the way in which the Labour administration is failing to be straightforward with council tax payers. Having decided to host the games, we have to recognise that there will be substantial costs, part of which will need to be funded by the city.\u201d Jon Hunt, the leader of the Liberal Democrat group on the city council and a Perry Barr councillor, added: \u201cIt could be good but we have to make sure it\u2019s good. We have challenges to make sure the games don\u2019t do harm. I think people are cautiously optimistic.\u201d",

We all agree that Olly needs to come home to his normal life surrounded by family and friends.\u201d A senior social worker was appointed on the case to promote the Olly\u2019s welfare, but the judge insisted it did not mean there was any chance of the child being placed in foster care. Essex police have urged anyone with information to get in touch.",

One rejection letter summed up the limiting view of the time \u2013 that British period drama should offer viewers a \u201ctreat\u201d by depicting \u201ceither a familiar title or a piece of history which is ripe for a revisit\u201d.</p> <p>Oyelowo\u2019s project is yet to be greenlit, but in the meantime Mary Queen of Scots and Lady Macbeth feature roles for black British actors, and 2018\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/03/victoria-abdul-review-judi-denchs-stephen-frears-venice-film-2017\">Victoria &amp; Abdul</a> joined Amma Asante\u2019s 2013 film Belle on the shortlist of British period dramas with non-white leads. This, too, can be justified by historical record (Onyeka\u2019s book Blackamoores documents a significant presence of dark-skinned people in Tudor England, for example), but as Worsley points out, that\u2019s rather missing the point: \u201cFeature films are not accurate historical sources \u2013 it\u2019s a very common misconception \u2013 but they are entertainment.

      "body": "<p>You know Brookmans Park, don\u2019t you? Of course you do \u2013 even if, like me, you\u2019ve never been there. It\u2019s a dormitory settlement in Hertfordshire, population around 3,000. Its railway station, leading straight to London, is its raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Shielded from further growth by the green belt, it looks broadly the same as when it sprang up in the 1930s. Around its village green cluster a few shops, including four estate agents, a hairdresser (Cutting It Fine) and a pet salon (Groomers on the Green). The three-bedroom semis all have front lawns ending in that hint of an Englishman\u2019s castle, crenellated walls. Today one of those houses will cost you three-quarters of a million. Know where I mean? Thought so.</p> <p>Tracey Thorn grew up there, in this \u201csea of green just off the coast of London\u201d. She spent her adolescence lurking at bus stops, going to 35p Monday night discos at the Brookmans Park Hotel before graduating to gigs at Hatfield Poly, all the time scribbling diary entries that eventually grew into songs.</p> <p>This diary, which she began in 1975 when she was 13, is filled with entries about not doing stuff. \u201cTried to phone Deb but no answer.\u201d \u201cTried to get some black trousers but couldn\u2019t get any nice ones.\u201d \u201cTried to go to the library but it was shut.\u201d Her comfortably dull days separate into fragments of non-events, \u201ca life described by what\u2019s missing, and what fails to happen\u201d.</p> <p>Thorn is not, she concedes, the first writer to have grown up stifled in suburbia. As one half of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/17/everything-but-girl-early-albums-interview\" title=\"\">Everything But the Girl</a>, though, she is well placed to explore how London\u2019s commuterland became what the novelist Michael Bracewell calls \u201cthe spiritual home of English pop\u201d. She knows first-hand how boredom and restlessness can cultivate creativity and crooked thinking. She grasps that, precisely because suburbia is a synthetic world, \u201ca stage set dropped on to an empty landscape\u201d, its bland exteriors conceal outlandish desires. And so a different small patch of south-east London around Bromley and Beckenham can give birth, through benign neglect, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie\" title=\"\">to David Bowie</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/oct/18/artsfeatures8\" title=\"\">David Sylvian</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/26/siouxsie-sioux-banshees-60-goth-pop-singer\" title=\"\">Siouxsie Sioux</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97297f107b1fb5bba4841217bef434d14e0030bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97297f107b1fb5bba4841217bef434d14e0030bf/0_293_5716_3429/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Everything But The Girl (Tracy Thorn and Ben Watt) by the Thames in Richmond, London, 1982.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Everything But the Girl (Tracy Thorn and Ben Watt) by the Thames in Richmond, London, 1982.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Corio/Michael Ochs Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Another Planet</em> is part memoir, part anthropology. The chapters flit between the 1970s and 2016, when Thorn journeyed back to this place she had not set foot in for more than 30 years, even though it is less than an hour via London Overground from her north London home. Following in the footsteps of other green belt writers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/11/outskirts-john-grindrod-review-concretopia\" title=\"\">John Grindrod</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/01/scarp-papadimitriou-walking-home-armitage\" title=\"\">Nick Papadamitriou</a>, she becomes an everyday ethnographer in this \u201ccontingent, liminal, border territory\u201d, outside the M25 and beyond the reach of the tube. Thorn is trying, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/johnupdike\" title=\"\">John Updike</a> put it, \u201cto give the mundane its beautiful due\u201d \u2013 to peel back those layers of suburban life that, cocooned in teenage self-concern, she once ignored. In her journeys between present and past, a stranger Brookmans Park emerges. Here there is no churchyard and hence \u201cno gravestones to gather moss or summon the grieving\u201d. Smaller trees, such as prunus, crab apple and silver birch, were planted there, giving \u201ca feeling of newness, even now, after 80 years\u201d. The main landmark is not a church spire or town hall clock but the transmitting station. Instead of steering people to a centre, this radiates radio waves to elsewhere. When Thorn listened to John Peel in her bedroom, the signal was coming from a mile away but \u201cfelt like it was being beamed \u2026 from a distant star\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1a6d01342d3f85700b31ef4fdce0bd81b533e293\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a6d01342d3f85700b31ef4fdce0bd81b533e293/0_53_1742_1045/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brookmans-Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brookmans-Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Tracey Thorn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That other planet, 1970s suburbia, comes to seem not lifeless but uncanny in its neatness and order. Beneath the apparent classlessness, the narcissism of minor differences asserts itself: one neighbour is dismissed as \u201cthe kind of person who has too many annuals in the front garden\u201d. The Jewish GP is blackballed from the golf club. Aged 13, Thorn snogs boys of 17 (and perhaps older) at discos. Brookmans Park is one of the many places that second-wave feminism failed to reach. Now Thorn notices how much the women she saw on TV \u2013 Thelma in <em>The Likely Lads</em>, Mildred in <em>George and Mildred</em>, Beverley in <em>Abigail\u2019s Party</em> \u2013 carried the blame for suburban tedium, for emasculating their men and \u201cforcing them into domesticity and acquisitiveness\u201d.</p> <p>There are touching sketches of Thorn\u2019s parents, as she tries to reverse-engineer what brought them, in 1956, to a still unfinished road full of potholes into which they emptied the ashes from the coal fire, and made them submit to 30 years of lunchtime drinks and fondue parties. For these natives of Kentish Town and Finsbury Park, she concludes, the suburbs were \u201ca place of greater safety\u201d, promising them clean air in place of pea-soup fog, fresh fields in place of bombsites. Of course, like everyone else, they failed to leave life and death behind. Thorn now sees how many of her teenage rows with her mother were really about what her mother was going through: a cancer scare, a hysterectomy, an abrupt menopause and general anxiety numbed by Valium.</p> <p>Readers of Thorn\u2019s two previous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/24/tracey-thorn-bedsit-disco-review\" title=\"\">memoirs</a> will recognise the tone of this book, with its beautifully clean style, careful self-questioning and pervasive likability. Sometimes it loses its focus in riffs about her present life, borrowed from her New Statesman columns. She calls Brookmans Park \u201cone of Planet London\u2019s moons\u201d and, as the book proceeds, the gravitational pull of her London life, and love of the city, gets stronger. I wanted her to stay in suburbia, walking up and down her old road, doing more of what Papadimitriou calls \u201cdeep topography\u201d, instead of making what looks like the odd day trip.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2016/dec/04/my-observer-michael-frayn-astor-profumo-cliveden\" title=\"\">Michael Frayn</a> once said that we would see the suburbs as \u201ca gigantic piece of folk art\u201d if we could only learn to look at them obliquely \u201cthrough the imagination they were designed to appeal to\u201d. Half of Thorn wants to do this oblique looking \u2013 the half of her that still has what she calls \u201csuburban bones\u201d. The other half remains that jaded teenager at a bus stop, daydreaming of escape.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Another Planet is published by Canongate (\u00a314.99).

This diary, which she began in 1975 when she was 13, is filled with entries about not doing stuff. \u201cTried to phone Deb but no answer.\u201d \u201cTried to get some black trousers but couldn\u2019t get any nice ones.\u201d \u201cTried to go to the library but it was shut.\u201d Her comfortably dull days separate into fragments of non-events, \u201ca life described by what\u2019s missing, and what fails to happen\u201d. Thorn is not, she concedes, the first writer to have grown up stifled in suburbia. As one half of Everything But the Girl, though, she is well placed to explore how London\u2019s commuterland became what the novelist Michael Bracewell calls \u201cthe spiritual home of English pop\u201d. She knows first-hand how boredom and restlessness can cultivate creativity and crooked thinking. She grasps that, precisely because suburbia is a synthetic world, \u201ca stage set dropped on to an empty landscape\u201d, its bland exteriors conceal outlandish desires. And so a different small patch of south-east London around Bromley and Beckenham can give birth, through benign neglect, to David Bowie, David Sylvian and Siouxsie Sioux. Another Planet is part memoir, part anthropology. The chapters flit between the 1970s and 2016, when Thorn journeyed back to this place she had not set foot in for more than 30 years, even though it is less than an hour via London Overground from her north London home. Following in the footsteps of other green belt writers such as John Grindrod and Nick Papadamitriou, she becomes an everyday ethnographer in this \u201ccontingent, liminal, border territory\u201d, outside the M25 and beyond the reach of the tube. Thorn is trying, as John Updike put it, \u201cto give the mundane its beautiful due\u201d \u2013 to peel back those layers of suburban life that, cocooned in teenage self-concern, she once ignored. In her journeys between present and past, a stranger Brookmans Park emerges. Here there is no churchyard and hence \u201cno gravestones to gather moss or summon the grieving\u201d. Smaller trees, such as prunus, crab apple and silver birch, were planted there, giving \u201ca feeling of newness, even now, after 80 years\u201d. The main landmark is not a church spire or town hall clock but the transmitting station. Instead of steering people to a centre, this radiates radio waves to elsewhere. When Thorn listened to John Peel in her bedroom, the signal was coming from a mile away but \u201cfelt like it was being beamed \u2026 from a distant star\u201d. That other planet, 1970s suburbia, comes to seem not lifeless but uncanny in its neatness and order. Beneath the apparent classlessness, the narcissism of minor differences asserts itself: one neighbour is dismissed as \u201cthe kind of person who has too many annuals in the front garden\u201d. The Jewish GP is blackballed from the golf club. Aged 13, Thorn snogs boys of 17 (and perhaps older) at discos. Brookmans Park is one of the many places that second-wave feminism failed to reach. Now Thorn notices how much the women she saw on TV \u2013 Thelma in The Likely Lads, Mildred in George and Mildred, Beverley in Abigail\u2019s Party \u2013 carried the blame for suburban tedium, for emasculating their men and \u201cforcing them into domesticity and acquisitiveness\u201d. There are touching sketches of Thorn\u2019s parents, as she tries to reverse-engineer what brought them, in 1956, to a still unfinished road full of potholes into which they emptied the ashes from the coal fire, and made them submit to 30 years of lunchtime drinks and fondue parties. For these natives of Kentish Town and Finsbury Park, she concludes, the suburbs were \u201ca place of greater safety\u201d, promising them clean air in place of pea-soup fog, fresh fields in place of bombsites. Of course, like everyone else, they failed to leave life and death behind. Thorn now sees how many of her teenage rows with her mother were really about what her mother was going through: a cancer scare, a hysterectomy, an abrupt menopause and general anxiety numbed by Valium. Readers of Thorn\u2019s two previous memoirs will recognise the tone of this book, with its beautifully clean style, careful self-questioning and pervasive likability. Sometimes it loses its focus in riffs about her present life, borrowed from her New Statesman columns. She calls Brookmans Park \u201cone of Planet London\u2019s moons\u201d and, as the book proceeds, the gravitational pull of her London life, and love of the city, gets stronger. I wanted her to stay in suburbia, walking up and down her old road, doing more of what Papadimitriou calls \u201cdeep topography\u201d, instead of making what looks like the odd day trip. Michael Frayn once said that we would see the suburbs as \u201ca gigantic piece of folk art\u201d if we could only learn to look at them obliquely \u201cthrough the imagination they were designed to appeal to\u201d. Half of Thorn wants to do this oblique looking \u2013 the half of her that still has what she calls \u201csuburban bones\u201d. The other half remains that jaded teenager at a bus stop, daydreaming of escape. \u2022 Another Planet is published by Canongate (\u00a314.99).

Not because he doesn\u2019t know who he is, but because I\u2019ve told him I\u2019m asking on behalf of my mum, who\u2019s never heard of him: how would he explain his job to her? \u201cI think I\u2019ll just say: \u2018I\u2019m a 25-year-old content creator who loves making things happen, whether that\u2019s things that people expect, or things people don\u2019t expect.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I say I\u2019m asking for my mum, but if I\u2019m honest I wasn\u2019t 100% sure who he was myself; and if you\u2019re over 35, chances are you don\u2019t know, either. It\u2019s not hard to get up to speed with his work, though, and by the time we meet I feel I know Deyes pretty well. I\u2019ve shared some of the lovely life he has with his lovely girlfriend Zoe, also a content creator. I\u2019ve met some of their lovely friends, their dog Nala, a black pug (no lovely for you, Nala, I\u2019m afraid), and the lovely orange Aga in the kitchen of their lovely home. I know that Alfie won\u2019t be working out until the summer this year, just doing a bit of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/aug/28/bouldering-rock-climbing-fontainebleau-france\" title=\"\">bouldering</a> at the local climbing centre. I know he used to have a special place under the mattress where he stuffed his bogeys, and that he wees sitting down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c8ee89f042d3b751e9fec47383989626b7bbc83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c8ee89f042d3b751e9fec47383989626b7bbc83/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deyes in the offices of A-Z Creative, the agency he set up with his girlfriend, Zoe Sugg, AKA YouTuber Zoella.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deyes in the offices of A-Z Creative, the agency he set up with his girlfriend, Zoe Sugg, AKA YouTuber Zoella.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Lake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I know all this because Alfie Deyes is a YouTuber, a vlogger, which means his whole life is pretty much laid bare on the internet. He started posting videos 10 years ago, when he was still at school in Brighton. \u201cI just picked up my little family holiday camera, put it on a stack of books, made a couple of videos, didn\u2019t tell any of my friends \u2013 and over six months, I grew an audience of 1,000 or so.\u201d One day he was at the cinema with friends, and some boys came over and asked if they could get a picture with him. \u201cMy friends were like, why? And I\u2019m like, super excited.\u201d</p> <p>Now, a decade on, Deyes is YouTube royalty and an A-list influencer: 11 million subscribers, 5.4 million Twitter followers, 4.3 million on Instagram. My then 17-year-old niece, I discover, once stalked Deyes around New York. The teenage daughter of a friend got a selfie with him in Amsterdam. The teenage son of another friend says he\u2019s \u201cmoist\u201d, which I think is not good.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Are Alfie and his girlfriend Zoella the UK\u2019s answer to Kim and Kanye? \u2018No way. If you told Kanye he was like anyone else, he\u2019d be upset\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And now Deyes is branching out, no longer just vlogging about his beautiful life. At 25, he needs to think about his future, his next phase, and so he\u2019s expanding into new projects, ones he\u2019s also super-excited about. This is why he has reached out to the Guardian, inviting me to spend the afternoon with him in his new offices in Brighton, where he still lives and works. Deyes does a lot of reaching out. He also says \u201cliterally\u201d every other word, almost literally. (It must get complicated at the climbing centre, bouldering, when he is, like, literally reaching out.)</p> <p>In person, Deyes is tall, welcoming, smiley. His teeth are so perfect, I try not to stare. The offices \u2013 let\u2019s call it an innovative hub \u2013 are on the fourth floor of an unassuming block not far from\u2026 well, I\u2019m not actually allowed to say where, for fear that my niece and others will set up camp outside. Alex, our photographer, is asked to disguise the skyline if it appears in any pictures, in case a determined fan has advanced navigation skills and manages to pinpoint the location. Deyes and Zoe used to live in Brighton town centre, but it got too much with all the hordes outside, so they moved to a seven-bedroom house somewhere\u2026 well, I\u2019m not even allowed to know where that is, and they\u2019ve managed to keep it secret. This is impressive when you consider how well we (I now consider myself a follower) know it on the inside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b5079fd1e88fdb6a3c2e6b1c7543d0cf9aa25bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b5079fd1e88fdb6a3c2e6b1c7543d0cf9aa25bc/1965_693_2182_3051/715.jpg\" alt=\"Deyes roadtests new, better quality merchandise for the vlog: \u2018I want it to mature with me,\u2019 he says.\" width=\"715\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deyes roadtests new, better quality merchandise for the vlog: \u2018I want it to mature with me,\u2019 he says.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Lake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Zoe \u2013 Zoe Sugg AKA<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/05/zoella-sugg-internet-queen-fastest-selling-novel-youtube\" title=\"\"> Zoella </a>\u2013 is also a YouTuber, fashion vlogger, influencer, novelist and more, as well as the sister of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/05/strictly-come-dancing-2018-all-the-contestants-ranked\" title=\"\">Joe Sugg</a>, the YouTuber and Strictly Come Dancing finalist.

Sugg has a bigger audience even than Deyes: nearly 12 million subscribers, 12.8 million Twitter followers, 10.2 million Instagram followers. Even I had heard of her (though I doubt my mum has). When they together launched a pop-up clothes shop in London, so many people turned up they had to leave because of<a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2017/08/24/zoella-alfie-deyes-and-joe-sugg-forced-to-leave-shop-launch-after-it-gets-dangerous-6875402/\" title=\"\"> security fears.</a> Are they their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/feb/09/broadcasting3\" title=\"\">generation\u2019s Posh\u2019n\u2019Becks</a>? \u201cNo!\u201d protests Deyes.

If you said to Kanye he was like anyone else, he would be upset.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway they are, Deyes says, \u201clike, very like, individuals. Our YouTube channels are very separate. We\u2019ve always had our own platforms doing very different things, before we even met.\u201d They do share the office hub, though, as well as the house and the pug, but today, Deyes tells me, Sugg is in meetings all afternoon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d1c29292d641ac6177cc095926f9d2ce5e9995a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d1c29292d641ac6177cc095926f9d2ce5e9995a/1540_342_3463_3079/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alfie Deyes and his team shot at A-Z Creatives offices in Brighton in Jan 2019 by Alex Lake\" width=\"1000\" height=\"889\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Oh! This is odd: I was warned in advance that Sugg was away this week and would not be able to speak to me. There was a chance she might answer some questions by email. It\u2019s probably just a mix-up: Sugg and Deyes are, after all, represented by different PR companies. Nothing says individual like a separate PR company.</p> <p>The office space of the couple\u2019s new shared creative agency, A-Z Creatives (even their initials are perfect; Z rhymes with bee here, by the way, not bed), is exactly what you\u2019d hope it to be. The walls are painted fashionable greys and oranges, there are exposed ventilation pipes, meeting rooms, hubs within hubs, a studio, a kitchen that is designed more for photography than actual cooking, a Brighton theme with nods to city landmarks, a couple of break-out areas modelled on beach huts. (Deyes\u2019 parents have a real one, on the beach, which you may or may not be able to see from the window.) The agency offers brand partnerships, creative producers, social-media managers and in-house legal and finance teams.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He is getting into longform content. An interview with a flat earther lasts 53 minutes, and Deyes pretty much runs with it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m offered a canned cucumber water from the fridge. Perfect, thank you. Cucumber water is what they drink in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/10/pls-like-a-brutal-new-mockumentary-satirising-youtube-stars\" title=\"\"> Pls Like</a>, Liam Williams\u2019s BBC Three mockumentary about YouTubers, or \u201cself-manipulating content puppets\u201d, as he calls them. The show focuses on the careers of vlogger Charlie South Mouth, who is maddeningly rich, happy and popular \u2013 but not as popular as his girlfriend, Millipede, who vlogs about beauty and fashion. They aren\u2019t a million views away from Deyes and Sugg. Williams, who wrote and stars in Pls Like, won\u2019t go so far as to say the characters are based on them, but admits he watched Deyes and Zoella\u2019s channels while doing his research.</p> <p>Deyes has never heard of Pls Like, so I show him a bit in which Millipede gives Charlie a fun little quiz about herself, with questions such as \u201cWhat\u2019s my blood group?\u201d, for her vlog. Deyes watches and says he doesn\u2019t mind people taking the piss: \u201cI take the piss out of myself half the time.\u201d And if Charlie <em>is</em> based on him, that\u2019s fine \u2013 \u201cI mean, he\u2019s a good-looking guy, so that\u2019s a compliment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1bbdb87f41a8e8f30e80a12b0668b6554eb7e8a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bbdb87f41a8e8f30e80a12b0668b6554eb7e8a8/0_885_3744_2531/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alfie Deyes and his team shot at A-Z Creatives offices in Brighton in Jan 2019 by Alex Lake\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Our first meeting of the afternoon is a merchandising one, with merchandising manager Sofia. Under discussion is a new range that will reflect the new brand. I\u2019m not allowed to know what the brand is called, or see the logo, but I will get my scoop, you\u2019ll see \u2013 even if it is a spoon-fed one. Deyes tries on hoodies in front of a full-length mirror, while Sofia comments on the size and cut and colour. Deyes takes photographs of himself to send to the merch WhatsApp group, because Lottie, another important member of the team, is on holiday. Plus he\u2019s filming the whole thing, because this meeting will probably end up in a vlog one day, in time-lapse, to show the fans the whole process. Once a merchandise garment has been decided on, Deyes will roadtest it on his vlogs, before branding it up and dropping it on to the website.</p> <p>Deyes explains the effect this stealth approach can have. \u201cLike, when we released this backpack. I was testing that backpack for so long no one even noticed, because it doesn\u2019t have a logo on. Then I released it and everyone in my comments was like, \u2018Oh shit, you\u2019ve literally been using that for ages!\u2019\u201d Sometimes it works the other way, his audience getting very excited when there\u2019s nothing to get excited about. \u201cLiterally. Like I\u2019ve had a non-branded item, and they\u2019re like: can\u2019t wait for you to drop those socks. I\u2019m like no, no, no, they\u2019re literally just my socks.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout the merch meeting, Nala is snuffling around under the table, hoovering up dropped shards of mini-poppadoms. She does well out of this, judging by her girth, if I\u2019m allowed to say that of a pug.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2edf3f3c84a974df8d82d6701d21901c810346a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2edf3f3c84a974df8d82d6701d21901c810346a2/0_327_4591_2254/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Sugg and their Madame Tussauds wax heads.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"491\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Sugg and their Madame Tussauds wax heads.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The new range is going to be better quality and more expensive than the stuff Deyes currently sells as PBmerch (PB stands for Pointless Blog, the name of his main YouTube channel). He\u2019s comfortable raising the prices. \u201cI just want it to mature and fit with me now: 25-year-old Alfie,\u201d says 25-year-old Alfie.</p> <p>Another thing this more mature, 25-year-old Alfie is doing less of is the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnEn0EUV13IR-_TK7fiIp3g\" title=\"\">PointlessBlogVlogs</a> about his life, and Sugg, and his friends, and Nala, and what sweets they\u2019re eating or where they\u2019re going for coffee. Instead of every day, he\u2019ll make just a couple a week. He\u2019s also getting into longer-form content. There have been a couple of interviews, one with a former London gang leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tales-of-the-everyday-extraordinary/video/2018/dec/24/i-was-being-led-by-a-lie-how-poet-karl-lokko-turned-his-back-on-gang-life-video\" title=\"\">Karl Lokko</a>, which is actually frank and pretty revealing, but at 1 hour 41 minutes baggier than an XXL hoodie. Another, a conversation with a flat earther, you might argue doesn\u2019t merit 53 seconds, let alone 53 minutes, but Deyes pretty much runs with it. Hey, maybe the earth <em>is</em> flat.</p> <p>There\u2019s also a new series, The Secret\u2019s Out, in which he and other YouTubers \u2013 Sugg and her brother Joe, Mark Ferris, the gang \u2013 sit around the table and discuss secrets sent in anonymously by fans, as well as chucking in a few of their own. That\u2019s how I know about the sit-down weeing and where Deyes used to smear his bogeys. OK, it\u2019s not exactly Newsnight, but it\u2019s more highly produced than Deyes\u2019 other vlogs, with episodes lasting on average around 40 minutes. The first episode of The Secret\u2019s Out has had, at the time of writing, 981,155 views. Newsnight, with average viewing figures of 350,000, would kill for 981,155 views.</p> <p>That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about: views. More viewers for your video means more ads being seen, means the more you earn. Different types of video can do better than others, so a beauty channel (Sugg\u2019s, say) could earn more than one with a less obvious focus like Deyes\u2019s; if you\u2019re watching a makeup tutorial you\u2019re quite likely to click on a makeup advert, and the share of the pie is bigger. Longer videos can run more ads, increasing the potential for clicks if the viewer sticks with it. Then there are multi-channel networks (MCNs), third-party service providers that will target and bring in higher-paid ads. But broadly speaking, views are good. Deyes gets a lot of them, even if he won\u2019t say what his monthly YouTube cheque is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"da13620ed33579713206d77c05074dd285bc8daf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da13620ed33579713206d77c05074dd285bc8daf/0_27_1048_629/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans at an event.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans at an event.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: xposurephotos.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are other ways YouTubers can earn.

Contract-wise, there are no set deliverables yet, says Alan, but Audi is coming in next Tuesday and this is all about developing a long-term relationship. Audi is a perfect fit: it\u2019s aspirational, and Deyes loves the brand. The event is on the 13 and 14 February, but he\u2019s already spoken to Sugg about celebrating Valentine\u2019s Day another time.</p> <p>There\u2019s an email from Grenade, which makes fitness products, bars and protein powders. They \u2013 Deyes and Alan \u2013 originally reached out (brand management is where all the reaching out goes on) to Grenade, said Deyes loved the products, but Grenade wasn\u2019t exploring any commercial opportunities at the time. Now it\u2019s looking for a \u201cbrand ambassador\u201d. I picture one of Deyes\u2019 ambassador receptions, noted in influencer society for their exquisite taste, a waiter coming in with a pyramid of fitness bars on a silver platter\u2026</p> <p>But I keep this thought to myself. Deyes is too young to remember a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/oct/08/advertising\" title=\"\">Ferrero Rocher campaign</a>. He\u2019s excited because Grenade has previously worked only with fitness influencers, and now it is reaching out to him, a lifestyle influencer. \u201cThat\u2019s brave \u2013 I like that,\u201d he says. He might have to start working out again, he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t gymmed since Christmas.\u201d</p> <p>Dave comes on the phone, and Deyes loudspeakers the call for my benefit. Dave is the business manager, and has been part of the whole journey of growing and building the team. Deyes wants to talk to him about a workshop event he\u2019s planning, here in Brighton, for about 40 or 50 people, in which he and others can share some of the things they\u2019ve learned: for instance, how to hire a team, get good lawyers, file a tax return, not give away where you live. \u201cI want it to be really mind-opening to anybody that is in this space, who is thinking inside of the current box that they\u2019re in, and helping them see outside of the box,\u201d he says, to clarify.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0fbfba010cb6674f20cf8e77818c1d0d4ab158c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0fbfba010cb6674f20cf8e77818c1d0d4ab158c/0_0_594_702/423.jpg\" alt=\"A fan takes a selfie with Deyes.\" width=\"423\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fan takes a selfie with Deyes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: xposurephotos.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dave\u2019s totally on board. \u201cI think the day will not just open their minds but also open their hearts,\u201d he summarises. Deyes wants to help because when he was starting out, 10 years ago, there was no one who had done it before to guide him. Does he feel the stress, the constant pressure to produce new content, in order to keep up the views, that you hear about from so many YouTubers? \u201cThere is, for sure, pressure,\u201d he says. \u201cBut my audience know me as an individual, not as a presenter. They know me so well that if I\u2019m, like, tired and having a week off and can\u2019t be making videos, they know me well enough to know there\u2019s a solid reason as to why.\u201d So they are loyal and won\u2019t abandon him. Maybe uploading his entire life is less self-manipulating content puppetry and more of a cunning strategy. Or an insurance against burnout.</p> <p>Deyes has business interests away from the social-media bubble, anyway. He\u2019s building a property empire; as well as the seven-bedroom house he shares with Sugg and Nala, he owns a few flats he rents to students. They don\u2019t know that Alfie Deyes is their landlord; his parents look after that side of things. How many flats? \u201cA couple.\u201d A couple\u2019s two, so two then? \u201cA bit more than two.\u201d Between two and six, that\u2019s as narrow as we get. My niece, the former stalker, is now a student in Brighton; I wonder if she is his tenant.</p> <p>\u201cAnother thing that we\u2019re working on that is not public, you guys have got the first on this\u2026\u201d he begins, then pauses, as if he\u2019s having second thoughts about letting it out. He\u2019s opening a bar. Alfie Deyes: pub landlord, that\u2019s my Guardian scoop. Perhaps he should have saved it for The Secret\u2019s Out, on the membership button. There\u2019s no name yet, or location; Brighton, obviously. Deyes is \u201cvery, very optimistic that it\u2019s going to be really, really cool\u201d. I worry about crowd control and traffic jams after the pop-up adventure.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He is opening  a pub, and renting flats to students. How many flats does he own? Between two and six is all he will say</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We\u2019re wandering round the hub now, doing the tour, the beach huts, chilling areas, a display of magazines, one \u2013 Blogosphere \u2013 with Deyes on the cover, lots featuring Sugg. Are they competitive with each other? No, he says. Even though she has more followers? \u201cI\u2019m happy for her \u2013 that\u2019s awesome. But again, we both do very different stuff.\u201d</p> <p>And here is Zoe! Not at all away but very much here, in the flesh, doing her very different stuff, in a huddle with her own team. She\u2019s preparing for a product meeting with a retailer tomorrow, so it\u2019s a meeting about a meeting. What\u2019s it like, living and working in the same space as Deyes, I ask her. \u201cHorrible,\u201d is the answer, but not from her \u2013 one of the others chips in. They laugh. I feel like I\u2019ve literally reached out and been left dangling and rejected. I really don\u2019t think Sugg wants to speak to me.</p> <p>Back to Deyes. I\u2019ve enjoyed my afternoon with him, his energy and industry as well as his teeth. If he makes a mistake, he learns from it, like the time he made a crass video about living on \u00a31 a day and was, quite rightly, crucified for it. Do all these other projects mean he\u2019s preparing for life after YouTube? \u201cNo. I love YouTube more than ever at the moment, especially now I\u2019ve started creating different styles of video.\u201d Will he still be doing it at 40? \u201cI hope so. I\u2019d like to think there\u2019ll be a video style that I enjoy making.\u201d</p> <p>What about the influencers\u2019 influence? Once children dreamed of being astronauts, ballet dancers, pop stars and footballers; now they want to be vloggers and YouTubers, if they aren\u2019t already. \u201cIsn\u2019t that insane,\u201d he says. \u201cIt makes me definitely proud, the amount of years I\u2019ve had YouTube as my job and people have gone: \u2018How\u2019s that a job? That\u2019s not a job\u2019. And now people are like \u2018OK, it\u2019s a job.\u2019 People finally understand and I like that.\u201d If he\u2019d been born 10 years earlier he would have gone into dentistry (of course!), or eco science, or perhaps accounting. But because of YouTube he\u2019s a multimillionaire who causes traffic jams.</p> <p>Does he want kids? \u201cDefinitely, at some point. Not like soon soon, like \u2018this year\u2019 kind of vibe. But I definitely want kids in the future.\u201d Do you hear that Nala? Your days may be numbered. But Nala has snuffled off to join Sugg\u2019s team.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like to make a comment on this piece, and be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p> <p>Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Who is Alfie Deyes? \u201cThat\u2019s a tricky one,\u201d he \u2013 Deyes \u2013 says. Not because he doesn\u2019t know who he is, but because I\u2019ve told him I\u2019m asking on behalf of my mum, who\u2019s never heard of him: how would he explain his job to her? \u201cI think I\u2019ll just say: \u2018I\u2019m a 25-year-old content creator who loves making things happen, whether that\u2019s things that people expect, or things people don\u2019t expect.\u2019\u201d I say I\u2019m asking for my mum, but if I\u2019m honest I wasn\u2019t 100% sure who he was myself; and if you\u2019re over 35, chances are you don\u2019t know, either. It\u2019s not hard to get up to speed with his work, though, and by the time we meet I feel I know Deyes pretty well. I\u2019ve shared some of the lovely life he has with his lovely girlfriend Zoe, also a content creator. I\u2019ve met some of their lovely friends, their dog Nala, a black pug (no lovely for you, Nala, I\u2019m afraid), and the lovely orange Aga in the kitchen of their lovely home. I know that Alfie won\u2019t be working out until the summer this year, just doing a bit of bouldering at the local climbing centre. I know he used to have a special place under the mattress where he stuffed his bogeys, and that he wees sitting down. I know all this because Alfie Deyes is a YouTuber, a vlogger, which means his whole life is pretty much laid bare on the internet. He started posting videos 10 years ago, when he was still at school in Brighton. \u201cI just picked up my little family holiday camera, put it on a stack of books, made a couple of videos, didn\u2019t tell any of my friends \u2013 and over six months, I grew an audience of 1,000 or so.\u201d One day he was at the cinema with friends, and some boys came over and asked if they could get a picture with him. \u201cMy friends were like, why? And I\u2019m like, super excited.\u201d Now, a decade on, Deyes is YouTube royalty and an A-list influencer: 11 million subscribers, 5.4 million Twitter followers, 4.3 million on Instagram. My then 17-year-old niece, I discover, once stalked Deyes around New York. The teenage daughter of a friend got a selfie with him in Amsterdam. The teenage son of another friend says he\u2019s \u201cmoist\u201d, which I think is not good. And now Deyes is branching out, no longer just vlogging about his beautiful life. At 25, he needs to think about his future, his next phase, and so he\u2019s expanding into new projects, ones he\u2019s also super-excited about. This is why he has reached out to the Guardian, inviting me to spend the afternoon with him in his new offices in Brighton, where he still lives and works. Deyes does a lot of reaching out. He also says \u201cliterally\u201d every other word, almost literally. (It must get complicated at the climbing centre, bouldering, when he is, like, literally reaching out.) In person, Deyes is tall, welcoming, smiley. His teeth are so perfect, I try not to stare. The offices \u2013 let\u2019s call it an innovative hub \u2013 are on the fourth floor of an unassuming block not far from\u2026 well, I\u2019m not actually allowed to say where, for fear that my niece and others will set up camp outside. Alex, our photographer, is asked to disguise the skyline if it appears in any pictures, in case a determined fan has advanced navigation skills and manages to pinpoint the location. Deyes and Zoe used to live in Brighton town centre, but it got too much with all the hordes outside, so they moved to a seven-bedroom house somewhere\u2026 well, I\u2019m not even allowed to know where that is, and they\u2019ve managed to keep it secret. This is impressive when you consider how well we (I now consider myself a follower) know it on the inside. Zoe \u2013 Zoe Sugg AKA Zoella \u2013 is also a YouTuber, fashion vlogger, influencer, novelist and more, as well as the sister of Joe Sugg, the YouTuber and Strictly Come Dancing finalist. Deyes\u2019 sister Poppy\u2019s at it too, they\u2019re a social media mafia. Sugg has a bigger audience even than Deyes: nearly 12 million subscribers, 12.8 million Twitter followers, 10.2 million Instagram followers. Even I had heard of her (though I doubt my mum has). When they together launched a pop-up clothes shop in London, so many people turned up they had to leave because of security fears. Are they their generation\u2019s Posh\u2019n\u2019Becks? \u201cNo!\u201d protests Deyes. Brighton\u2019s Kim and Kanye? \u201cNo, I\u2019m just a normal 25-year-old, no way. If you said to Kanye he was like anyone else, he would be upset.\u201d Anyway they are, Deyes says, \u201clike, very like, individuals. Our YouTube channels are very separate. We\u2019ve always had our own platforms doing very different things, before we even met.\u201d They do share the office hub, though, as well as the house and the pug, but today, Deyes tells me, Sugg is in meetings all afternoon. Oh! This is odd: I was warned in advance that Sugg was away this week and would not be able to speak to me. There was a chance she might answer some questions by email. It\u2019s probably just a mix-up: Sugg and Deyes are, after all, represented by different PR companies. Nothing says individual like a separate PR company. The office space of the couple\u2019s new shared creative agency, A-Z Creatives (even their initials are perfect; Z rhymes with bee here, by the way, not bed), is exactly what you\u2019d hope it to be. The walls are painted fashionable greys and oranges, there are exposed ventilation pipes, meeting rooms, hubs within hubs, a studio, a kitchen that is designed more for photography than actual cooking, a Brighton theme with nods to city landmarks, a couple of break-out areas modelled on beach huts. (Deyes\u2019 parents have a real one, on the beach, which you may or may not be able to see from the window.) The agency offers brand partnerships, creative producers, social-media managers and in-house legal and finance teams. I\u2019m offered a canned cucumber water from the fridge. Perfect, thank you. Cucumber water is what they drink in Pls Like, Liam Williams\u2019s BBC Three mockumentary about YouTubers, or \u201cself-manipulating content puppets\u201d, as he calls them. The show focuses on the careers of vlogger Charlie South Mouth, who is maddeningly rich, happy and popular \u2013 but not as popular as his girlfriend, Millipede, who vlogs about beauty and fashion. They aren\u2019t a million views away from Deyes and Sugg. Williams, who wrote and stars in Pls Like, won\u2019t go so far as to say the characters are based on them, but admits he watched Deyes and Zoella\u2019s channels while doing his research. Deyes has never heard of Pls Like, so I show him a bit in which Millipede gives Charlie a fun little quiz about herself, with questions such as \u201cWhat\u2019s my blood group?\u201d, for her vlog. Deyes watches and says he doesn\u2019t mind people taking the piss: \u201cI take the piss out of myself half the time.\u201d And if Charlie is based on him, that\u2019s fine \u2013 \u201cI mean, he\u2019s a good-looking guy, so that\u2019s a compliment.\u201d Our first meeting of the afternoon is a merchandising one, with merchandising manager Sofia. Under discussion is a new range that will reflect the new brand. I\u2019m not allowed to know what the brand is called, or see the logo, but I will get my scoop, you\u2019ll see \u2013 even if it is a spoon-fed one. Deyes tries on hoodies in front of a full-length mirror, while Sofia comments on the size and cut and colour. Deyes takes photographs of himself to send to the merch WhatsApp group, because Lottie, another important member of the team, is on holiday. Plus he\u2019s filming the whole thing, because this meeting will probably end up in a vlog one day, in time-lapse, to show the fans the whole process. Once a merchandise garment has been decided on, Deyes will roadtest it on his vlogs, before branding it up and dropping it on to the website. Deyes explains the effect this stealth approach can have. \u201cLike, when we released this backpack. I was testing that backpack for so long no one even noticed, because it doesn\u2019t have a logo on. Then I released it and everyone in my comments was like, \u2018Oh shit, you\u2019ve literally been using that for ages!\u2019\u201d Sometimes it works the other way, his audience getting very excited when there\u2019s nothing to get excited about. \u201cLiterally. Like I\u2019ve had a non-branded item, and they\u2019re like: can\u2019t wait for you to drop those socks. I\u2019m like no, no, no, they\u2019re literally just my socks.\u201d Throughout the merch meeting, Nala is snuffling around under the table, hoovering up dropped shards of mini-poppadoms. She does well out of this, judging by her girth, if I\u2019m allowed to say that of a pug. The new range is going to be better quality and more expensive than the stuff Deyes currently sells as PBmerch (PB stands for Pointless Blog, the name of his main YouTube channel). He\u2019s comfortable raising the prices. \u201cI just want it to mature and fit with me now: 25-year-old Alfie,\u201d says 25-year-old Alfie. Another thing this more mature, 25-year-old Alfie is doing less of is the PointlessBlogVlogs about his life, and Sugg, and his friends, and Nala, and what sweets they\u2019re eating or where they\u2019re going for coffee. Instead of every day, he\u2019ll make just a couple a week. He\u2019s also getting into longer-form content. There have been a couple of interviews, one with a former London gang leader, Karl Lokko, which is actually frank and pretty revealing, but at 1 hour 41 minutes baggier than an XXL hoodie. Another, a conversation with a flat earther, you might argue doesn\u2019t merit 53 seconds, let alone 53 minutes, but Deyes pretty much runs with it. Hey, maybe the earth is flat. There\u2019s also a new series, The Secret\u2019s Out, in which he and other YouTubers \u2013 Sugg and her brother Joe, Mark Ferris, the gang \u2013 sit around the table and discuss secrets sent in anonymously by fans, as well as chucking in a few of their own. That\u2019s how I know about the sit-down weeing and where Deyes used to smear his bogeys. OK, it\u2019s not exactly Newsnight, but it\u2019s more highly produced than Deyes\u2019 other vlogs, with episodes lasting on average around 40 minutes. The first episode of The Secret\u2019s Out has had, at the time of writing, 981,155 views. Newsnight, with average viewing figures of 350,000, would kill for 981,155 views. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about: views. More viewers for your video means more ads being seen, means the more you earn. Different types of video can do better than others, so a beauty channel (Sugg\u2019s, say) could earn more than one with a less obvious focus like Deyes\u2019s; if you\u2019re watching a makeup tutorial you\u2019re quite likely to click on a makeup advert, and the share of the pie is bigger. Longer videos can run more ads, increasing the potential for clicks if the viewer sticks with it. Then there are multi-channel networks (MCNs), third-party service providers that will target and bring in higher-paid ads. But broadly speaking, views are good. Deyes gets a lot of them, even if he won\u2019t say what his monthly YouTube cheque is. There are other ways YouTubers can earn. Deyes will be launching a membership button soon: you pay \u00a35.99 a month for exclusive content, early access, livestreams, the ability to get closer to the man himself. Then, especially for influencers, there are the paid partnerships, which is what our next meeting is about, with Alan, the brands partnerships manager. Audi has reached out and invited Deyes to an event in Marbella, driving a new model. It would like Deyes to take over its social media while he\u2019s out there. Contract-wise, there are no set deliverables yet, says Alan, but Audi is coming in next Tuesday and this is all about developing a long-term relationship. Audi is a perfect fit: it\u2019s aspirational, and Deyes loves the brand. The event is on the 13 and 14 February, but he\u2019s already spoken to Sugg about celebrating Valentine\u2019s Day another time. There\u2019s an email from Grenade, which makes fitness products, bars and protein powders. They \u2013 Deyes and Alan \u2013 originally reached out (brand management is where all the reaching out goes on) to Grenade, said Deyes loved the products, but Grenade wasn\u2019t exploring any commercial opportunities at the time. Now it\u2019s looking for a \u201cbrand ambassador\u201d. I picture one of Deyes\u2019 ambassador receptions, noted in influencer society for their exquisite taste, a waiter coming in with a pyramid of fitness bars on a silver platter\u2026 But I keep this thought to myself. Deyes is too young to remember a Ferrero Rocher campaign. He\u2019s excited because Grenade has previously worked only with fitness influencers, and now it is reaching out to him, a lifestyle influencer. \u201cThat\u2019s brave \u2013 I like that,\u201d he says. He might have to start working out again, he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t gymmed since Christmas.\u201d Dave comes on the phone, and Deyes loudspeakers the call for my benefit. Dave is the business manager, and has been part of the whole journey of growing and building the team. Deyes wants to talk to him about a workshop event he\u2019s planning, here in Brighton, for about 40 or 50 people, in which he and others can share some of the things they\u2019ve learned: for instance, how to hire a team, get good lawyers, file a tax return, not give away where you live. \u201cI want it to be really mind-opening to anybody that is in this space, who is thinking inside of the current box that they\u2019re in, and helping them see outside of the box,\u201d he says, to clarify. Dave\u2019s totally on board. \u201cI think the day will not just open their minds but also open their hearts,\u201d he summarises. Deyes wants to help because when he was starting out, 10 years ago, there was no one who had done it before to guide him. Does he feel the stress, the constant pressure to produce new content, in order to keep up the views, that you hear about from so many YouTubers? \u201cThere is, for sure, pressure,\u201d he says. \u201cBut my audience know me as an individual, not as a presenter. They know me so well that if I\u2019m, like, tired and having a week off and can\u2019t be making videos, they know me well enough to know there\u2019s a solid reason as to why.\u201d So they are loyal and won\u2019t abandon him. Maybe uploading his entire life is less self-manipulating content puppetry and more of a cunning strategy. Or an insurance against burnout. Deyes has business interests away from the social-media bubble, anyway. He\u2019s building a property empire; as well as the seven-bedroom house he shares with Sugg and Nala, he owns a few flats he rents to students. They don\u2019t know that Alfie Deyes is their landlord; his parents look after that side of things. How many flats? \u201cA couple.\u201d A couple\u2019s two, so two then? \u201cA bit more than two.\u201d Between two and six, that\u2019s as narrow as we get. My niece, the former stalker, is now a student in Brighton; I wonder if she is his tenant. \u201cAnother thing that we\u2019re working on that is not public, you guys have got the first on this\u2026\u201d he begins, then pauses, as if he\u2019s having second thoughts about letting it out. He\u2019s opening a bar. Alfie Deyes: pub landlord, that\u2019s my Guardian scoop. Perhaps he should have saved it for The Secret\u2019s Out, on the membership button. There\u2019s no name yet, or location; Brighton, obviously. Deyes is \u201cvery, very optimistic that it\u2019s going to be really, really cool\u201d. I worry about crowd control and traffic jams after the pop-up adventure. We\u2019re wandering round the hub now, doing the tour, the beach huts, chilling areas, a display of magazines, one \u2013 Blogosphere \u2013 with Deyes on the cover, lots featuring Sugg. Are they competitive with each other? No, he says. Even though she has more followers? \u201cI\u2019m happy for her \u2013 that\u2019s awesome. But again, we both do very different stuff.\u201d And here is Zoe! Not at all away but very much here, in the flesh, doing her very different stuff, in a huddle with her own team. She\u2019s preparing for a product meeting with a retailer tomorrow, so it\u2019s a meeting about a meeting. What\u2019s it like, living and working in the same space as Deyes, I ask her. \u201cHorrible,\u201d is the answer, but not from her \u2013 one of the others chips in. They laugh. I feel like I\u2019ve literally reached out and been left dangling and rejected. I really don\u2019t think Sugg wants to speak to me. Back to Deyes. I\u2019ve enjoyed my afternoon with him, his energy and industry as well as his teeth. If he makes a mistake, he learns from it, like the time he made a crass video about living on \u00a31 a day and was, quite rightly, crucified for it. Do all these other projects mean he\u2019s preparing for life after YouTube? \u201cNo. I love YouTube more than ever at the moment, especially now I\u2019ve started creating different styles of video.\u201d Will he still be doing it at 40? \u201cI hope so. I\u2019d like to think there\u2019ll be a video style that I enjoy making.\u201d What about the influencers\u2019 influence? Once children dreamed of being astronauts, ballet dancers, pop stars and footballers; now they want to be vloggers and YouTubers, if they aren\u2019t already. \u201cIsn\u2019t that insane,\u201d he says. \u201cIt makes me definitely proud, the amount of years I\u2019ve had YouTube as my job and people have gone: \u2018How\u2019s that a job? That\u2019s not a job\u2019. And now people are like \u2018OK, it\u2019s a job.\u2019 People finally understand and I like that.\u201d If he\u2019d been born 10 years earlier he would have gone into dentistry (of course!), or eco science, or perhaps accounting. But because of YouTube he\u2019s a multimillionaire who causes traffic jams. Does he want kids? \u201cDefinitely, at some point. Not like soon soon, like \u2018this year\u2019 kind of vibe. But I definitely want kids in the future.\u201d Do you hear that Nala? Your days may be numbered. But Nala has snuffled off to join Sugg\u2019s team. \u2022 If you would like to make a comment on this piece, and be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).

We still send out party invites and birth announcements, but by text and email as opposed to Royal Mail, and we take photos of ourselves on holiday, but put them on Facebook instead of in family albums. And we worry about the images our children are seeing, but where once those images came from fashion magazines, now they\u2019re piped directly into kids\u2019 phones and laptops.</p> <p>Molly Russell was only 14 when she killed herself in 2017, leaving behind a devastated family and a lot of anguished questions. Her father, Ian, has been extraordinarily brave in talking about his daughter. He has described his horror at discovering the images of self-harm she had been looking at on Instagram and Pinterest,<strong> </strong>encouraged by those sites\u2019 algorithms, which had noted Molly\u2019s interest in certain subjects. According to Ian, even after Molly died, Pinterest was emailing her harmful photographs. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Instagram played a part in Molly\u2019s death,\u201d he said last weekend.</p> <p>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/26/matt-hancock-facebook-social-media-suicide-self-harm-young-people\" title=\"\">offered up his tuppence</a>, saying he felt \u201cphysically sick\u201d about Molly\u2019s death. He added: \u201cI feel the fear of a parent that our children can be torn away from us, aided by new technology. So I am determined to do what is necessary to stop teenagers falling into a suicide trap.\u201d</p> <p>The shrug-face emoji irresponsibility of big tech companies is a hot topic at the moment, from Facebook\u2019s apparent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/13/they-dont-care-facebook-fact-checking-in-disarray-as-journalists-push-to-cut-ties\" title=\"\">inability to stop promoting fake news</a> to Amazon\u2019s decidedly lax <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/17/workers-rights-bosses-tech-amazon-profits-staff\" title=\"\">approach to workers\u2019 rights</a>. The Russell family is absolutely right to call out Instagram\u2019s failure to filter out clearly toxic images, just as parents were right 15 years ago to call out fashion magazines for using too-skinny models. Admittedly, I have some scepticism about whether that earlier outcry changed much: as anyone who has picked up a fashion magazine recently can tell you, they are still full of skinny models. But it is always worth pointing out immoral (or amoral) behaviour instead of allowing it to become quietly normalised.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/commentisfree/2019/jan/05/yoga-14-years-what-got-me-hooked\">I'm still terrible at yoga, 14 years after I started \u2013 so what's got me hooked? | Hadley Freeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As happened with fashion magazines two decades ago, the story has been seized on, especially the trendy social media angle, and it\u2019s coverage like this that proves Chris Morris\u2019s The Day Today was not satire but a prediction of the future..

And in fact, buried within the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/molly-russells-father-cutting-biting-burning-my-daughter-was-shown-it-all-on-social-media-x0grb8vgt\" title=\"\">news stories</a> about Molly\u2019s \u201cnormal, happy childhood\u201d are more telling details that have received less play.

Despite the Tories\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/20/jeremy-hunt-promises-better-mental-health-services-children-adolescents\" title=\"\">frequent platitudes</a> about mental health, this has not been matched by anything close to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/21/cash-to-boost-childrens-mental-health-not-getting-through-says-charity\" title=\"\">sufficient funding</a>. Mental health trust budgets and funding for early intervention services have been slashed, and rates of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/23/nhs-figures-show-shocking-rise-self-harm-young-people\" title=\"\">depression and self-harm in young people</a> have rocketed. We are now in what is widely agreed to be an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/31/young-people-mental-health-crisis-uk-us-suicide\" title=\"\">adolescent mental health crisis</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/27/uk-children-who-need-mental-health-services-face-postcode-lottery\" title=\"\">waiting lists</a> for psychiatric services as long as 18 months. Schools are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/apr/15/pupils-mental-health-cuts-services-stress-teachers\" title=\"\">trying to fill the gap</a>, but teachers are overwhelmed. They have asked for more training in spotting potential problems and educating kids about coping with their feelings, and handling, yes, social media \u2013 but that requires funding, which is<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/oct/04/government-accused-of-covering-up-schools-cuts-with-misleading-figures\" title=\"\"> not coming any time soon</a>.</p> <p>These are not sexy discussion topics, certainly less sexy than Instagram. But they are central if we are serious about helping vulnerable adolescents, rather than sensationalising other families\u2019 tragedies. Of course, social media companies should abide by their own codes of conduct and not host harmful images; but the problem is not that these images exist, but that so many young people are seeking them out, and being affected by them. Just as not everyone who looked at a photo of a skinny model in the 90s became anorexic, so not everyone today who sees an image of self-harm on Pinterest will act on it. But some \u2013 children, teenagers and adults \u2013 will, and that is because these images are a symptom, not the root problem. Focusing on them is like concentrating on which Instagram filter to use: you\u2019re not looking at the actual picture.</p> <p>\u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

      "bodyText": "Technology changes the medium but not the message. We still send out party invites and birth announcements, but by text and email as opposed to Royal Mail, and we take photos of ourselves on holiday, but put them on Facebook instead of in family albums. And we worry about the images our children are seeing, but where once those images came from fashion magazines, now they\u2019re piped directly into kids\u2019 phones and laptops. Molly Russell was only 14 when she killed herself in 2017, leaving behind a devastated family and a lot of anguished questions. Her father, Ian, has been extraordinarily brave in talking about his daughter. He has described his horror at discovering the images of self-harm she had been looking at on Instagram and Pinterest, encouraged by those sites\u2019 algorithms, which had noted Molly\u2019s interest in certain subjects. According to Ian, even after Molly died, Pinterest was emailing her harmful photographs. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Instagram played a part in Molly\u2019s death,\u201d he said last weekend. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, offered up his tuppence, saying he felt \u201cphysically sick\u201d about Molly\u2019s death. He added: \u201cI feel the fear of a parent that our children can be torn away from us, aided by new technology. So I am determined to do what is necessary to stop teenagers falling into a suicide trap.\u201d The shrug-face emoji irresponsibility of big tech companies is a hot topic at the moment, from Facebook\u2019s apparent inability to stop promoting fake news to Amazon\u2019s decidedly lax approach to workers\u2019 rights. The Russell family is absolutely right to call out Instagram\u2019s failure to filter out clearly toxic images, just as parents were right 15 years ago to call out fashion magazines for using too-skinny models. Admittedly, I have some scepticism about whether that earlier outcry changed much: as anyone who has picked up a fashion magazine recently can tell you, they are still full of skinny models. But it is always worth pointing out immoral (or amoral) behaviour instead of allowing it to become quietly normalised. As happened with fashion magazines two decades ago, the story has been seized on, especially the trendy social media angle, and it\u2019s coverage like this that proves Chris Morris\u2019s The Day Today was not satire but a prediction of the future.. One newspaper columnist made the jaw-droppingly irresponsible claim that \u201cI can state without a shadow of a doubt that if Instagram had existed when I was a teenager, I too would be dead,\u201d while TV reporters shoved photos of slit wrists at tech bosses while crying out \u201cThere\u2019s a dead girl!\u201d and demanding apologies. To suggest simple causation with suicide is deeply dangerous, because it risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy for the most vulnerable; there is a reason why the Samaritans strongly advise against it. And in fact, buried within the news stories about Molly\u2019s \u201cnormal, happy childhood\u201d are more telling details that have received less play. In an interview, Ian Russell described finding notes in Molly\u2019s journal after her death: \u201cShe tried to describe what depression was like. She likened it to being in a little boat and a storm bearing down on her.\u201d I\u2019m sure it\u2019s satisfying for members of this government to wag their fingers self-righteously at wealthy tech bosses in San Francisco. But if Hancock is really so \u201cdetermined\u201d to help unhappy teenagers, he could start by sorting out the child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs), which have been decimated under his party\u2019s austerity programme. Despite the Tories\u2019 frequent platitudes about mental health, this has not been matched by anything close to sufficient funding. Mental health trust budgets and funding for early intervention services have been slashed, and rates of depression and self-harm in young people have rocketed. We are now in what is widely agreed to be an adolescent mental health crisis, with waiting lists for psychiatric services as long as 18 months. Schools are trying to fill the gap, but teachers are overwhelmed. They have asked for more training in spotting potential problems and educating kids about coping with their feelings, and handling, yes, social media \u2013 but that requires funding, which is not coming any time soon. These are not sexy discussion topics, certainly less sexy than Instagram. But they are central if we are serious about helping vulnerable adolescents, rather than sensationalising other families\u2019 tragedies. Of course, social media companies should abide by their own codes of conduct and not host harmful images; but the problem is not that these images exist, but that so many young people are seeking them out, and being affected by them. Just as not everyone who looked at a photo of a skinny model in the 90s became anorexic, so not everyone today who sees an image of self-harm on Pinterest will act on it. But some \u2013 children, teenagers and adults \u2013 will, and that is because these images are a symptom, not the root problem. Focusing on them is like concentrating on which Instagram filter to use: you\u2019re not looking at the actual picture. \u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

      "body": "<h2>\u201cThe Tribute\u201d by Jane Gardam (1980)</h2> <p>John McGahern and Annie Proulx are among my favourite authors, but to dispel gloom I choose this story from Jane Gardam\u2019s 1980 collection <em>The Sidmouth Letters</em>. Reading this gleeful story in my expatriate days, I recognised the cast of \u201cdiplomatic wives\u201d, trailing inebriate husbands through the ruins of empire. Mostly dialogue, it is a deft, witty tale in which a small kindness \u2013 though not by a diplomatic wife \u2013 pays off 40 years later. I must have read it a dozen times, to see how its note is sustained and the surprise is sprung; every time it makes me smile with delight. <strong>Hilary Mantel</strong></p> <h2>\u201cThe Stone Boy\u201d by Gina Berriault (1957)</h2> <p>This great and underrated masterpiece is a meditation on good and evil and especially about the way that people\u2019s expectations and assumptions about us may wear us down and eventually force us into compliance with their view. But it is a much deeper and more biblical story than that and, like any great work of art, resists reduction. Berriault, who died in 1999, is known as a San Francisco writer. A wonderful sampling of her stories is available in <em>Women in Their Beds: New &amp; Selected Stories</em>. <strong>George Saunders</strong></p> <h2>\u201cThe Love of a Good Woman\u201d by Alice Munro (1998)</h2> <p>Among the handful of short stories closest to my heart, I\u2019ve chosen \u201cThe Love of a Good Woman\u201d by Canadian writer Munro, from her 1998 collection of that name. It\u2019s about a murder \u2013 probably it\u2019s a murder, because nothing is certain \u2013 and a love match that depends on keeping that murder secret. Like so many of Munro\u2019s stories, this one has the scope of a novel yet never feels hurried or crowded. The sociology of a small town in rural Ontario is caught on the wing in the loose weave of her narration; the story takes in whole lifetimes, and yet its pace is also exquisitely slow, carrying us deep inside particular moments. A woman moves among the willows beside a river at night, making up her mind. <strong>Tessa Hadley</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3ffaa2e7ec5157e51c6dcf9825a751faae189c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3ffaa2e7ec5157e51c6dcf9825a751faae189c3/0_0_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alice Munro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alice Munro carries us deep inside particular moments.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alice Munro./Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u201cThe Siren\u201d by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa (1961)</h2> <p>Born in Palermo in 1896, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/giuseppe-tomasi-di-lampedusa\" title=\"\">Lampedusa</a> was a learned prince who died before his work was published. In addition to his celebrated novel <em>The Leopard</em>, he left behind some short stories, including \u201cThe Siren\u201d, a mysterious masterpiece that jolts and haunts me every time I read it. It contains two narrative planes, two central protagonists, two settings, two tonal registers and two points of view. There are even two titles; though published as \u201cLa Sirena\u201d, it was originally called \u201cLighea\u201d, the name of the siren, portrayed as a 16-year-old girl. Lampedusa\u2019s description renders this fatefully seductive creature specific, vulnerable and real. <strong>Jhumpa Lahiri<br></strong><em>The Penguin Book of Italian Short Stories, edited by Jhumpa Lahiri, will be published on 7 March.</em></p> <h2>\u201cA Simple Heart\u201d by Gustave Flaubert (1877)</h2> <p>Flaubert wrote this story for his old friend and \u201cfellow troubadour\u201d George Sand. It\u2019s the story of F\u00e9licit\u00e9, an old servant-woman, and the diminishing loves in her life, the final one being a (live \u2013 at first) parrot. It has a sombre novelistic density, and is touching and tender, comic and grotesque. Control of tone is central to its effect. It also exemplifies the Flaubertian principle that irony and sympathy are not incompatible. Sand died before she was able to read it. \u201cSo it is with all our dreams,\u201d noted Flaubert. <strong>Julian Barnes</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5710c12b25394a28820905c7571c221d0dbe24d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5710c12b25394a28820905c7571c221d0dbe24d9/101_0_1183_1183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Books that look like sushi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>\u201cFriends\u201d by Grace Paley (1985)</h2> <p>This story tracks three friends as they visit a fourth who is dying. The women then go home on the train. It ends with a brief conversation between the narrator, Faith, and her 18-year-old son. The piece has warm intimacy as well as cold spaces within it. It captures the all-encompassing intrusion of the world and its conditioning of our day-to-day emotions, our children\u2019s colonisation of our hearts and our powerlessness ultimately to protect them. Its understated tone is perfectly pitched: the narrative moves gently, then soars, into either sadness, or joyful contentment \u2013 again and again. I am in this story, and so is the world. <strong>Ahdaf Soueif</strong></p> <h2>\u201cMy Life\u201d by Anton Chekhov (1896)</h2> <p>This is Chekhov\u2019s longest short story and one of the very few he wrote in the first-person singular. It\u2019s the autobiography of a young man in provincial Russia struggling to live up to his lofty ideals and being brought down by life\u2019s random contingencies. I actually adapted \u201cMy Life\u201d for a play and know it intimately. If you could only read a single Chekhov story then this is the one: all his gifts and genius \u2013 the wry, dark comedy of his voice, his unique angle on the human condition, his refusal to judge \u2013 are contained in it. <strong>William Boyd</strong></p> <h2>\u201cIn the Night\u201d by Jamaica Kincaid (1978)</h2> <p>Part poetic incantation, part eccentric kaleidoscopic vision, this is a story which contorts each time you read it. Born in Antigua, Kincaid invents aesthetics which are wholly unique, transfiguring human form and surroundings, in particular, the Caribbean landscapes. Here, she conveys the multiple textures of smaller islands, creating a literary geography which remains experimental, new and indefinable. <strong>Irenosen Okojie</strong></p> <h2>\u201cMusic at Annahullion\u201d by Eugene McCabe (2004)</h2> <p>McCabe\u2019s story is set on the border between Monaghan and Fermanagh sometime in the 1950s or 60s. Two brothers and a sister are uneasily sharing a smallholding. The landscape itself and the states of sour feeling are described with sharpness and precision. When the sister announces that she would like a piano that is advertised for sale locally, one of the brothers buys it for her. But it won\u2019t fit into the house and is left to rot outside. The failure to get the piano into the house has an extraordinary power and pathos. Its purchase has stood for all hope, and now there is no hope. The hard-won sense of despair and darkness in the final pages of this small masterpiece is memorable and chilling. <strong>Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"249316ed38dd3d0137c05d66da38a12c4ed01703\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/249316ed38dd3d0137c05d66da38a12c4ed01703/0_150_3517_2111/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jo Ann Beard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Densely textured reportage \u2026 Jo Ann Beard</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u201cWerner\u201d by Jo Ann Beard (2007)</h2> <p>Only afterwards did I discover that this was in fact a piece of densely textured reportage, but it taught me so much about how to write a short story that I will always see it as one. A young man, Werner Hoeflich, trapped by a fire, escapes by leaping from the window of his New York apartment, across the intervening gap and in through the window of the adjacent building. It has the richness of a novel, the raw and dirty grip of life and was, for me, a revelation. Fine language and a deftly conjured mood are all well and good, but fiction \u2013 of whatever length \u2013 should thrill. <strong>Mark Haddon</strong></p> <h2>\u201cThe Window Theatre\u201d by Ilse Aichinger (1953)</h2> <p>Miscommunication, antic disposition, voyeurism, glee \u2013 this translation of one of Aichinger\u2019s most famous stories provides windows upon windows upon windows. Simply expressed and made to linger long in the mind, it was my first experience of the prizewinning Austrian writer and her dark, precise prose styling, and the start of an ongoing pursuit on my part to read more of her work. <strong>Eley Williams</strong></p> <h2>\u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart\u201d by Edgar Allan Poe (1843)</h2> <p>Poe\u2019s obsessive theme was the terror of losing sanity \u2013 never more dramatically evoked than in this masterpiece. In \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart\u201d, one of Poe\u2019s shortest \u201ctales of the grotesque and arabesque\u201d, and the one that seems most contemporary in the hallucinatory intensity of its narration, an unnamed individual commits a brutal, seemingly unprovoked murder of an old man with whom he lives, disposes of the body by dismembering and burying it beneath the floorboards of the residence they share, and succumbs to madness and self-destruction in the aftermath of guilt. Throughout, the narrator insists on his sanity: \u201cTrue \u2013 nervous \u2013 very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses \u2013 not destroyed \u2013 not dulled them.\u201d That the murder is entirely irrational is acknowledged by the murderer: \u201cObject there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! One of his eyes resembled that of a vulture \u2013 a pale blue eye, with a film over it.\u201d</p> <p>Poe is a master of the \u201cunreliable narrator\u201d \u2013 a voice that speaks with devastating spontaneity and is utterly convincing \u2013 that has come to be a staple of much suspense and horror fiction in the 20th and 21st centuries. Unhampered by the literary pretensions of certain of Poe\u2019s other, longer stories, totally committed to its unrepentant pathology, and its visceral celebration of this pathology, \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart\u201d is the very essence of Poe, as Poe is himself the very essence of the American gothic tradition. <strong>Joyce Carol Oates</strong></p> <h2>\u201cAn Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\u201d by Ambrose Bierce (1890)</h2> <p>Many readers might come to this from the short film, made rather confusingly in French. But it\u2019s a tale set during the American civil war. Peyton Farquhar is being hanged by Union soldiers on a small bridge in Alabama. To say more might ruin the experience of reading it. When I happened on the story a few years ago, I thought I might be one of only a few intrepid readers. Of course, it is considered to be one of the best stories in American literature. <strong>Sebastian Barry</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4be5f577adada9b0b0f8a3f205aef956537e9c92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4be5f577adada9b0b0f8a3f205aef956537e9c92/0_136_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sushi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>\u201cAfter Rain\u201d by William Trevor (1996)</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/19/last-stories-william-trevor-review-julian-barnes\">William Trevor</a> has influenced me more than any other writer, and it\u2019s impossible for me to name one story by him that is an absolute favourite. I can, however, name 20 to 30 stories that I return to often. One of these is \u201cAfter Rain\u201d. A woman travels alone to recover from a love that has ended too abruptly, but the wish that solitude could exorcise loneliness is as faulty as the wish that love could exorcise disappointment brought by love. The story to me is like an eye drop for the mind. It doesn\u2019t offer a resolution to life\u2019s muddiness, but it offers a moment of clarity. <strong>Yiyun Li</strong></p> <h2>\u201cIn the Heart of the Heart of the Country\u201d by William H Gass (1968)</h2> <p>The thing that is most striking about this story, aside from its restrained, grave beauty, is that it should manage to be so moving. On one level it is a dryly detailed and topographically exact portrait of a small town in the American midwest, but on another it is a devastating threnody for lost love. Gass was one of the great prose stylists, and the writing here is typically smooth and pellucid, conjuring its effects by stealth and unflagging control. Simply, and by simple means, a masterpiece. <strong>John Banville</strong></p> <h2>\u201cAmerican Express\u201d by James Salter (1988)</h2> <p>The temporal shifts in James Salter\u2019s short fiction are its distinguishing glory. Decades unfold inside the beat of a sentence; a single moment might linger unspoken for many pages. Time seems to concertina, expanding and contracting to open out pockets of aromatic description. In \u201cAmerican Express\u201d, a pair of venal New York lawyers make a shabby killing and embark with their riches on a playboy jaunt through Italy, where one of them takes up with a schoolgirl. The story deals in oxymorons \u2013 bitter desire, weak power \u2013 and jolts to a conclusion that is harsh, cool, indelible. <strong>Kevin Barry</strong></p> <h2>\u201cParadise\u201d by Edna O\u2019Brien (2014)</h2> <p>Key to a great short story is the tension and torsion created within each sentence. \u201cParadise\u201d combines remarkable disquiet, poetry and narrative drive. O\u2019Brien is a phenomenal architect of landscape, both physical and human, imbuing her setting with exact detail, lush discomfort, intrigue and counterintuitive fate. The main character, a nurse, has been taken to the overseas villa of her rich lover. Not only must she learn to swim and entertain his companions, she\u2019s interviewing \u2013 without any real prospect \u2013 for the position of wife. The story is lit with sexual chemistry, but travels a horribly misaligned path. Its true test lies in finding an exit from the female dream. <strong>Sarah Hall</strong></p> <h2>\u201cHands\u201d by Sherwood Anderson (1916)</h2> <p>This is a strange, dark little story. Its charm comes from the eccentricities of its subject, former schoolteacher Wing Biddlebaum, since \u201cthe story of Wing Biddlebaum is a story of hands\u201d. Anderson evokes the Ohio town of Winesburg by focusing on the hands of its inhabitants. Wing\u2019s hands are \u201cslender, and forever trying to conceal themselves\u201d and he notices how the hands of those around him are \u201cquieter, inexpressive\u201d. And it\u2019s the wandering hands of Wing Biddlebaum, who has changed his name from Adolph Myers, that leads to the story\u2019s disturbing conclusion. <strong>Guy Gunaratne</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/07/the-books-interview-david-sedaris-calypso\">David Sedaris: \u2018The audience thinks I\u2019m monstrous\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u201cLet It Snow\u201d by David Sedaris (2003)</h2> <p>Sedaris is in the fifth grade when heavy snow closes the schools. After a few days, his mother breaks down: \u201cGet the hell out of my house,\u201d she says, \u201cand stay out!\u201d. The little Sedarises go off sledding and return to find the door locked against them. They peer through the window to see their mother watching TV and glugging wine. \u2018Open the door,\u2019 they yell, \u2018it\u2019s us!\u2019. She closes the drapes on them. \u201cThat bitch!\u201d shouts a Sedaris sister. Fun turns to fear, mild sibling savagery follows and then, suddenly, it\u2019s OK again.</p> <p>A story \u2013 more memoir than fiction \u2013 that starts with the recognition that the very sight of you drives your mother to drink is attractive to me. But when it ends with that mother wading barelegged through five inches of snow to reach you, it\u2019s everything a story should be. It\u2019s <em>The Sound of Music</em>/<em>Lord of the Flies</em>/<em>Owl Babies</em> in a few short pages. He is a genius. <strong>Nina Stibbe</strong>.<br><em>Reasons to Be Cheerful by Nina Stibbe</em> <em>will be published by Viking on 28 March</em>.</p> <h2>\u201cThe Distance of the Moon\u201d by Italo Calvino (1963)</h2> <p>This is a gloriously sensual story, narrated by a man who wants another\u2019s wife \u2013 but the true star of the show is the moon. Calvino imagines it so close it risks dipping its scales in the sea. Fishermen gather lunar milk as the protagonist writhes in unrequited love. It is a great example of magic realism \u2013 full of texture and motion and mischief and longing. <strong>Leone Ross <br></strong><em>Come Let Us Sing Anyway</em>, <em>by Leone Ross, is published by Peepal Tree.</em></p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2><strong>Contemporary and classic tales picked by Chris Power</strong></h2> <h2>\u201cCivil Peace\u201d by Chinua Achebe (1971)</h2> <p>Achebe didn\u2019t write many short stories (in the preface to his 1972 collection, <em>Girls at War</em>, he notes that \u201ca dozen pieces in twenty years must be accounted a pretty lean harvest by any reckoning\u201d), but his best are deeply memorable. \u201cCivil Peace\u201d takes place in the immediate aftermath of the Biafran war, and gives vivid life to the luck and misfortune experienced by Jonathan Iwegbu \u2013 an incorrigible optimist in a devastated society \u2013 and the surviving members of his family.</p> <h2>\u201cIn a Bamboo Grove\u201d by Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa (1921)</h2> <p>Akutagawa\u2019s ingenious riddle of a story takes the form of seven testimonies given to a magistrate in the course of a murder investigation. A samurai has been found dead in a bamboo grove, but the narrative doesn\u2019t end with the confession of the notorious bandit Taj\u014dmaru. Instead, two subsequent testimonies, that of the samurai\u2019s wife and of the samurai himself, via a spirit medium, contradict each other and the bandit\u2019s story, and ask the reader to turn investigator and puzzle out the truth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78e9c58dfac1a1765ddbc8b98306d3f9dbcf7f88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78e9c58dfac1a1765ddbc8b98306d3f9dbcf7f88/269_138_5275_3165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Atwood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thought-provoking \u2026 Margaret Atwood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u201cHappy Endings\u201d by Margaret Atwood (1983)</h2> <p>Alice Munro once said: \u201cI want the story to exist somewhere so that in a way it\u2019s still happening \u2026 I don\u2019t want it to be shut up in the book and put away \u2013 oh well, that\u2019s what happened.\u201d Atwood articulates the same position in this fun, thought-provoking story that begins with a man meeting a woman, then offers variants of what happens next. Any ending that isn\u2019t death, she concludes, is false, and the interesting part of stories isn\u2019t what happens, but how and why.</p> <h2>\u201cGoing to Meet the Man\u201d by James Baldwin (1965)</h2> <p>A southern white deputy sheriff tries and fails to have sex with his wife. As she goes to sleep he talks about the vicious beating he gave a black protestor earlier that day, and returns to a deeper and even darker memory from his childhood: the ritual killing of a black man. After the killing, there was a picnic. Baldwin doesn\u2019t deny his character humanity, but as the story\u2019s shocking climax shows, neither does he forgive him.</p> <h2>\u201cThe Garden of Forking Paths\u201d by Jorge Luis Borges (1941)</h2> <p>When described in summary, there is a danger of reducing Borges to a collection of tropes: labyrinths, mirrors, invented books (he avoided \u201cthe madness of composing vast books\u201d by pretending they exist and writing commentaries on them). But with these elements he explored some of the most thrilling ideas in fiction. Labyrinths and strange books are both present here, as is a theory of existence that anticipates the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Extraordinarily, all these elements are enfolded within an account of a wartime espionage mission.</p> <h2>\u201cThis Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen\u201d by Tadeusz Borowski (1946)</h2> <p>From spring 1943 to summer 1944 the young Polish poet Borowski was a political prisoner in Auschwitz. His stories are some of the darkest documents in world literature. This one describes the narrator\u2019s first shift as a kapo unloading trains packed with Jewish men, women and children. Borowski\u2019s prose alternates between a blunt numbness and image making of extraordinary power.</p> <h2>\u201cThe Company of Wolves\u201d by Angela Carter (1979)</h2> <p>In <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/24/classics.angelacarter\" title=\"\">The Bloody Chamber</a></em> Angela Carter rewrote some of the best known fairytales \u2013 \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d, \u201cSnow White\u201d, \u201cBluebeard\u201d \u2013 challenging their assumptions about gender, sexual cruelty and morality. In \u201cThe Company of Wolves\u201d Red Riding Hood is no longer the meek victim of the wolf, but a woman of agency and courage who uses her sexuality to tame him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8602df6770b157c959567ab890431c89e1c6214b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8602df6770b157c959567ab890431c89e1c6214b/53_0_1228_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sushi books\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>\u201cWhy Don\u2019t You Dance?\u201d by Raymond Carver (1981)</h2> <p>The best Carver stories don\u2019t require the conventional techniques of exposition or backstory but create an extraordinary immediacy. Here we witness a man who has taken his furnishings and arranged them on his lawn: bed, couch, desk, turntable, lamp. It\u2019s all for sale, and as the man gets drunk with a young couple looking to furnish their apartment, we can guess how he has got here. But a hangnail of the unknowable remains, and stays long in the memory.</p> <h2>\u201cThe Country Husband\u201d by John Cheever (1954)</h2> <p>Cheever is known as a chronicler of the suburbs, but in this story the leafy neighbourhood of Shady Hill, a recurring location in his fiction, blends the domestic with something much stranger, almost magical. The story is comic (its title mirrors William Wycherley\u2019s 1675 comedy of manners <em>The Country-Wife</em>), but darker currents work beneath its surface and it builds to a stunning finale that is one of the most rapturous passages Cheever ever wrote.</p> <h2>\u201cAn Outpost of Progress\u201d by Joseph Conrad (1897)</h2> <p>Kayerts and Carlier, agents for the Great Trading Company, are \u201ctwo perfectly insignificant and incapable individuals\u201d left in charge of a remote trading station. Conrad mines a deep vein of irony as he describes their work \u201cserving the cause of progress\u201d. As the story unfolds, and the men are shown to be idiotic cogs in the engine of colonialism, Conrad exposes the gap between the high-flown language of such projects (\u201cprogress\u201d, \u201ccivilisation\u201d, \u201cvirtue\u201d) and their brutal reality.</p> <h2>\u201cTwilight of the Superheroes\u201d by Deborah Eisenberg (2006)</h2> <p>Eisenberg\u2019s story is high on the list of great literature about 9/11. Since the 1990s she has examined the effects of American power on the world and asked the question one of her characters asks here: \u201cHow far away does something have to be before you have the right to not really know about it?\u201d The attack on New York, that \u201cterrible day\u201d, although it seemed to come from nowhere, \u201chad been prepared for a long, long time, though it had been prepared behind a curtain\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df60d5572e6f8a31f0b0fbfafcaa7cb974ec1525\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df60d5572e6f8a31f0b0fbfafcaa7cb974ec1525/67_647_2248_1348/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mavis Gallant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mavis Gallant shows a profound grasp of the psychology of love affairs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u201cIn the Tunnel\u201d by Mavis Gallant (1971)</h2> <p>Sarah\u2019s father sends her from Canada to Grenoble as a way of ending her relationship with a married professor, but she ends up on the French Riviera. There she meets Roy, an ex-prison inspector, and rashly moves in with him. The story\u2019s charge arises from a combination of wit, the awfulness of the relationship\u2019s collapse, and Gallant\u2019s profound grasp of the psychology of love affairs. She talks about her characters in a way that makes you feel your own perceptiveness is being worked like a muscle.</p> <h2>\u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper\u201d by Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1892)</h2> <p>During her lifetime Gilman was best known for her nonfiction, and she was forgotten after her suicide. Her fiction, in particular \u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper\u201d, was rediscovered in the 1970s by feminist academics. This chilling story takes the \u201cmadwoman\u201d figure of gothic fiction, memorably used by Charlotte Bront\u00eb in <em>Jane Eyre</em>, and describes her experience from the inside looking out. Having been told to avoid mental stimulation by her doctor following an episode of depression, Gilman wrote the story to \u201cconvince him of the error of his ways\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2018/mar/06/what-makes-a-good-short-story-with-chris-power-books-podcast\">What makes a good short story?

The main character of this bleakly hilarious story, the downtrodden government clerk Akaky Akakievich, is arguably the first antihero in modern literature, and his doomed pursuit of a new overcoat one of the most memorably absurd quests in fiction.</p> <h2>\u201cSix Feet of the Country\u201d by Nadine Gordimer (1953)</h2> <p>The reality of apartheid, and later the effects of its aftermath, dominates Gordimer\u2019s fiction. Here her narrator, who has escaped the tension of Johannesburg to play at farming in a rural suburb, becomes enraged when, following the death and autopsy of one of his workers\u2019 brothers, the authorities return the wrong body for burial. Despite his efforts to achieve justice, the story\u2019s final, bitterly ironic lines reveal that he is blind to his own racism.</p> <h2>\u201cBig Two-Hearted River\u201d by Ernest Hemingway (1925)</h2> <p>Hemingway\u2019s distinctive style \u2013 which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/johnupdike\" title=\"\">John Updike</a> described as \u201cgleaming economy and aggressive minimalism\u201d \u2013 is stunningly showcased here. Nick Adams\u2019s journey into the Michigan backwoods is also a journey into his own war-damaged psyche, and his unwillingness to fish the deep water of the swamp a resonant evocation of trauma.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48a3a5b3fdc96782988b5bdc2577b9e80f232f08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48a3a5b3fdc96782988b5bdc2577b9e80f232f08/0_137_4714_2828/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kazuo Ishiguro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Visions of an alternative Britain \u2026 Kazuo Ishiguro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Grant/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u201cA Village After Dark\u201d by Kazuo Ishiguro (2001)</h2> <p>The tension in this uncanny piece is stoked by Ishiguro\u2019s refusal to provide more than tantalising fragments of backstory. At nightfall an old man, Fletcher, arrives at a village where he once held great influence, but is now resented (\u201cI was mistaken about a lot of things,\u201d he admits). This might be an alternative Britain, or a future one. The dilapidated buildings and Fletcher\u2019s tramp-like appearance give the story a Beckettian feel, while its allegorical quality carries over to Ishiguro\u2019s novel <em>The Buried Giant</em>.</p> <h2>\u201cThe Lottery\u201d by Shirley Jackson (1948)</h2> <p>Asked to describe her writing, Jackson once noted its fascination with \u201cthe uncontrolled, unobserved wickedness of human behaviour\u201d. \u201cThe Lottery\u201d, in which a crowd gathers for a ceremony in the main square of a New England village on a sunny June morning, ends with one of the nastiest surprises in fiction. When the New Yorker printed the story it became the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/13/cat-person-short-story-that-launched-thousand-theories\" title=\"\">Cat Person</a>\u201d of its era as letters flooded in expressing admiration, disgust, and \u2013 unbelievably \u2013 concern that the gruesome story was true.</p> <h2>\u201cEmergency\u201d by Denis Johnson (1991)</h2> <p>Johnson\u2019s story begins in a hospital emergency room. It\u2019s the night shift, and Fuckhead (his nickname is the only name for him we get) and Georgie are taking care of hospital business while swallowing every pharmaceutical they can get their hands on. When their shift finishes, they drive into the countryside and reality unravels completely. Johnson rides a line between the sacred and the profane, between hilarity and sadness., and writes prose that will take your breath away</p> <h2>\u201cAraby\u201d by James Joyce (1914)</h2> <p>The stories in <em>Dubliners</em> divide into the four stages of life, and \u201cAraby\u201d encapsulates the turbulence and humiliation of adolescence in a boy\u2019s lonely night-time journey across Dublin to buy a gift for the girl he loves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44b5a03cd63e87443181f680ae3602dc435222af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44b5a03cd63e87443181f680ae3602dc435222af/0_732_3327_1996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Joyce.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Joyce explores the turbulence and humiliation of adolescence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lipnitzki/Roger Viollet/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u201cA Bright Green Field\u201d by Anna Kavan (1958)</h2> <p>If you love JG Ballard, you should read Anna Kavan. Few novelists, Ballard said, \u201ccould match the intensity of her vision\u201d, and that same intensity fuels her stories. The narrator of \u201cA Bright Green Field\u201d claims to encounter the same, unnaturally vivid field of grass wherever she goes. It\u2019s an unlikely candidate for a bete noire, but Kavan\u2019s descriptions of a mountain town in the gathering gloom, loomed over by \u201cthe sheer emerald wall that was the meadow\u201d, create an atmosphere of powerful unease.</p> <h2>\u201cExtra\u201d by Yiyun Li (2003)</h2> <p>Granny Lin is 51, and doesn\u2019t know when everyone started calling her granny. Working as a maid at a boarding school in the Beijing suburbs she develops feelings for six-year-old Kang, a rich man\u2019s illegitimate son, an unwanted \u201cextra\u201d who \u201chas to be got rid of\u201d. Granny Lin\u2019s love is complicated; is it maternal, or is it perhaps the great romance she missed out on in her youth? Li has a Chekhovian ability to disappear from the text, allowing a remarkable intensity to develop between reader and story.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/20/evening-in-paradise-lucia-berlin-review\">Evening in Paradise: More Stories by Lucia Berlin \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u201cThe Husband Stitch\u201d by Carmen Maria Machado (2014)</h2> <p>Machado takes a grisly campfire tale (\u201cThe Green Ribbon\u201d), combines it with the purported medical practice of suturing a woman\u2019s perineum with an extra stitch or two after childbirth to increase her husband\u2019s pleasure, and creates a powerful modern fable about misogyny and motherhood. Before her wedding day, as Machado expertly builds the atmosphere of foreboding, the narrator notes that, \u201cBrides never fare well in stories. Stories can sense happiness and snuff it out like a candle\u201d.</p> <h2>\u201cMadame Tellier\u2019s House\u201d by Guy de Maupassant (1881)</h2> <p>Maupassant, probably the only short-story writer as influential as Chekhov, wrote in two modes: short, impressively constructed but one-dimensional stories with trick endings (\u201cThe Necklace\u201d is the most famous of these), and longer, more interesting work. He wrote \u201cMadame Tellier\u2019s House\u201d after a friend reported passing a brothel in Rouen with a sign on its door saying, \u201cClosed because of First Communion\u201d. His expansion on this irresistible detail resulted in one of his greatest stories.</p> <h2>\u201cA Horse and Two Goats\u201d by RK Narayan (1970)</h2> <p>Narayan, who wrote more than 200 short stories, called them \u201cconcentrated miniatures of human experience in all its opulence\u201d. The opulence of the clay horse at the centre of this story has faded beneath the Indian sun, but the conversation it triggers between an American tourist who speaks no Tamil and Muni, a poor peasant who speaks no English, is not only very funny, but also telling about the degree to which misunderstanding is an unavoidable part of human interaction.</p> <h2>\u201cMinutes of Glory\u201d by Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong\u2019o (1976)</h2> <p>This story by Kenya\u2019s most prominent writer follows the struggles of barmaid Beatrice as she works in a succession of increasingly seedy establishments. Men prey on her, buying her body as if it were \u201ca bag of potatoes or a sack of cabbages\u201d, and her hopes of living the high life in Nairobi become more unlikely by the day. \u201cShe fought life with dreams,\u201d Ng\u0169g\u0129 writes, and through a reckless action Beatrice\u2019s fantasies briefly become reality before the story reaches its sorrowful conclusion.</p> <h2>\u201cA Good Man Is Hard to Find\u201d by Flannery O\u2019Connor (1953)</h2> <p>This story is a vicious and darkly funny account of a family\u2019s encounter with a criminal gang led by the psychotic Misfit. Its closing lines, and the apparent act of grace they describe, are as memorable as they are ambiguous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a0b73deb3951ca6791ec0af8f728e8870215f37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a0b73deb3951ca6791ec0af8f728e8870215f37/0_221_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Akhil Sharma.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emotional impact \u2026 Akhil Sharma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ulf Andersen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u201cWe Didn\u2019t Like Him\u201d by Akhil Sharma (2013)</h2> <p>Two boys grow up together on a lane in Delhi. One, the narrator, becomes a lawyer. The other, Manshu, becomes pandit of the local temple. The narrator\u2019s burgeoning dislike for Manshu, the way the events of life bring them back into contact with one another, the Hindu burial process and the mechanics of \u201cputting someone in the Ganges\u201d: these elements are so absorbingly animated that the story\u2019s emotional impact, when it arrives, feels like an ambush.</p> <h2>\u201cHeads of the Colored People: Four Fancy Sketches, Two Chalk Outlines, and No Apology\u201d by Nafissa Thompson-Spires (2015)</h2> <p>Police shoot two black men outside a comic-book convention in LA, while halfway across the country an artist buys his daughter a cupcake at a vegan bakery. Thompson-Spires\u2019s self-reflexive story is \u201cangry, like a big black fist\u201d, but it\u2019s also breathtaking in the way it loops back and forth in time and constantly second-guesses the reader\u2019s assumptions.</p> <h2>\u201cSmote (or When I Find I Cannot Kiss You in Front of a Print by Bridget Riley)\u201d by Eley Williams (2015)</h2> <p>\u201cTo kiss you,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/01/attrib-and-other-stories-by-eley-williams-review\" title=\"\">this story</a> begins, \u201cshould not involve such fear of precision.\u201d Williams\u2019s story is less a stream of consciousness than a barrelling wave, as a woman debates whether or not to kiss her girlfriend in an art gallery, and all the doubt, thrill, uncertainty, hilarity and panic of love is compressed into a few seconds of indecision.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cThe Tribute\u201d by Jane Gardam (1980) John McGahern and Annie Proulx are among my favourite authors, but to dispel gloom I choose this story from Jane Gardam\u2019s 1980 collection The Sidmouth Letters. Reading this gleeful story in my expatriate days, I recognised the cast of \u201cdiplomatic wives\u201d, trailing inebriate husbands through the ruins of empire. Mostly dialogue, it is a deft, witty tale in which a small kindness \u2013 though not by a diplomatic wife \u2013 pays off 40 years later. I must have read it a dozen times, to see how its note is sustained and the surprise is sprung; every time it makes me smile with delight. Hilary Mantel \u201cThe Stone Boy\u201d by Gina Berriault (1957) This great and underrated masterpiece is a meditation on good and evil and especially about the way that people\u2019s expectations and assumptions about us may wear us down and eventually force us into compliance with their view. But it is a much deeper and more biblical story than that and, like any great work of art, resists reduction. Berriault, who died in 1999, is known as a San Francisco writer. A wonderful sampling of her stories is available in Women in Their Beds: New &amp; Selected Stories. George Saunders \u201cThe Love of a Good Woman\u201d by Alice Munro (1998) Among the handful of short stories closest to my heart, I\u2019ve chosen \u201cThe Love of a Good Woman\u201d by Canadian writer Munro, from her 1998 collection of that name. It\u2019s about a murder \u2013 probably it\u2019s a murder, because nothing is certain \u2013 and a love match that depends on keeping that murder secret. Like so many of Munro\u2019s stories, this one has the scope of a novel yet never feels hurried or crowded. The sociology of a small town in rural Ontario is caught on the wing in the loose weave of her narration; the story takes in whole lifetimes, and yet its pace is also exquisitely slow, carrying us deep inside particular moments. A woman moves among the willows beside a river at night, making up her mind. Tessa Hadley \u201cThe Siren\u201d by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa (1961) Born in Palermo in 1896, Lampedusa was a learned prince who died before his work was published. In addition to his celebrated novel The Leopard, he left behind some short stories, including \u201cThe Siren\u201d, a mysterious masterpiece that jolts and haunts me every time I read it. It contains two narrative planes, two central protagonists, two settings, two tonal registers and two points of view. There are even two titles; though published as \u201cLa Sirena\u201d, it was originally called \u201cLighea\u201d, the name of the siren, portrayed as a 16-year-old girl. Lampedusa\u2019s description renders this fatefully seductive creature specific, vulnerable and real. Jhumpa Lahiri The Penguin Book of Italian Short Stories, edited by Jhumpa Lahiri, will be published on 7 March. \u201cA Simple Heart\u201d by Gustave Flaubert (1877) Flaubert wrote this story for his old friend and \u201cfellow troubadour\u201d George Sand. It\u2019s the story of F\u00e9licit\u00e9, an old servant-woman, and the diminishing loves in her life, the final one being a (live \u2013 at first) parrot. It has a sombre novelistic density, and is touching and tender, comic and grotesque. Control of tone is central to its effect. It also exemplifies the Flaubertian principle that irony and sympathy are not incompatible. Sand died before she was able to read it. \u201cSo it is with all our dreams,\u201d noted Flaubert. Julian Barnes \u201cFriends\u201d by Grace Paley (1985) This story tracks three friends as they visit a fourth who is dying. The women then go home on the train. It ends with a brief conversation between the narrator, Faith, and her 18-year-old son. The piece has warm intimacy as well as cold spaces within it. It captures the all-encompassing intrusion of the world and its conditioning of our day-to-day emotions, our children\u2019s colonisation of our hearts and our powerlessness ultimately to protect them. Its understated tone is perfectly pitched: the narrative moves gently, then soars, into either sadness, or joyful contentment \u2013 again and again. I am in this story, and so is the world. Ahdaf Soueif \u201cMy Life\u201d by Anton Chekhov (1896) This is Chekhov\u2019s longest short story and one of the very few he wrote in the first-person singular. It\u2019s the autobiography of a young man in provincial Russia struggling to live up to his lofty ideals and being brought down by life\u2019s random contingencies. I actually adapted \u201cMy Life\u201d for a play and know it intimately. If you could only read a single Chekhov story then this is the one: all his gifts and genius \u2013 the wry, dark comedy of his voice, his unique angle on the human condition, his refusal to judge \u2013 are contained in it. William Boyd \u201cIn the Night\u201d by Jamaica Kincaid (1978) Part poetic incantation, part eccentric kaleidoscopic vision, this is a story which contorts each time you read it. Born in Antigua, Kincaid invents aesthetics which are wholly unique, transfiguring human form and surroundings, in particular, the Caribbean landscapes. Here, she conveys the multiple textures of smaller islands, creating a literary geography which remains experimental, new and indefinable. Irenosen Okojie \u201cMusic at Annahullion\u201d by Eugene McCabe (2004) McCabe\u2019s story is set on the border between Monaghan and Fermanagh sometime in the 1950s or 60s. Two brothers and a sister are uneasily sharing a smallholding. The landscape itself and the states of sour feeling are described with sharpness and precision. When the sister announces that she would like a piano that is advertised for sale locally, one of the brothers buys it for her. But it won\u2019t fit into the house and is left to rot outside. The failure to get the piano into the house has an extraordinary power and pathos. Its purchase has stood for all hope, and now there is no hope. The hard-won sense of despair and darkness in the final pages of this small masterpiece is memorable and chilling. Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn \u201cWerner\u201d by Jo Ann Beard (2007) Only afterwards did I discover that this was in fact a piece of densely textured reportage, but it taught me so much about how to write a short story that I will always see it as one. A young man, Werner Hoeflich, trapped by a fire, escapes by leaping from the window of his New York apartment, across the intervening gap and in through the window of the adjacent building. It has the richness of a novel, the raw and dirty grip of life and was, for me, a revelation. Fine language and a deftly conjured mood are all well and good, but fiction \u2013 of whatever length \u2013 should thrill. Mark Haddon \u201cThe Window Theatre\u201d by Ilse Aichinger (1953) Miscommunication, antic disposition, voyeurism, glee \u2013 this translation of one of Aichinger\u2019s most famous stories provides windows upon windows upon windows. Simply expressed and made to linger long in the mind, it was my first experience of the prizewinning Austrian writer and her dark, precise prose styling, and the start of an ongoing pursuit on my part to read more of her work. Eley Williams \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart\u201d by Edgar Allan Poe (1843) Poe\u2019s obsessive theme was the terror of losing sanity \u2013 never more dramatically evoked than in this masterpiece. In \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart\u201d, one of Poe\u2019s shortest \u201ctales of the grotesque and arabesque\u201d, and the one that seems most contemporary in the hallucinatory intensity of its narration, an unnamed individual commits a brutal, seemingly unprovoked murder of an old man with whom he lives, disposes of the body by dismembering and burying it beneath the floorboards of the residence they share, and succumbs to madness and self-destruction in the aftermath of guilt. Throughout, the narrator insists on his sanity: \u201cTrue \u2013 nervous \u2013 very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses \u2013 not destroyed \u2013 not dulled them.\u201d That the murder is entirely irrational is acknowledged by the murderer: \u201cObject there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! One of his eyes resembled that of a vulture \u2013 a pale blue eye, with a film over it.\u201d Poe is a master of the \u201cunreliable narrator\u201d \u2013 a voice that speaks with devastating spontaneity and is utterly convincing \u2013 that has come to be a staple of much suspense and horror fiction in the 20th and 21st centuries. Unhampered by the literary pretensions of certain of Poe\u2019s other, longer stories, totally committed to its unrepentant pathology, and its visceral celebration of this pathology, \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart\u201d is the very essence of Poe, as Poe is himself the very essence of the American gothic tradition. Joyce Carol Oates \u201cAn Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\u201d by Ambrose Bierce (1890) Many readers might come to this from the short film, made rather confusingly in French. But it\u2019s a tale set during the American civil war. Peyton Farquhar is being hanged by Union soldiers on a small bridge in Alabama. To say more might ruin the experience of reading it. When I happened on the story a few years ago, I thought I might be one of only a few intrepid readers. Of course, it is considered to be one of the best stories in American literature. Sebastian Barry \u201cAfter Rain\u201d by William Trevor (1996) William Trevor has influenced me more than any other writer, and it\u2019s impossible for me to name one story by him that is an absolute favourite. I can, however, name 20 to 30 stories that I return to often. One of these is \u201cAfter Rain\u201d. A woman travels alone to recover from a love that has ended too abruptly, but the wish that solitude could exorcise loneliness is as faulty as the wish that love could exorcise disappointment brought by love. The story to me is like an eye drop for the mind. It doesn\u2019t offer a resolution to life\u2019s muddiness, but it offers a moment of clarity. Yiyun Li \u201cIn the Heart of the Heart of the Country\u201d by William H Gass (1968) The thing that is most striking about this story, aside from its restrained, grave beauty, is that it should manage to be so moving. On one level it is a dryly detailed and topographically exact portrait of a small town in the American midwest, but on another it is a devastating threnody for lost love. Gass was one of the great prose stylists, and the writing here is typically smooth and pellucid, conjuring its effects by stealth and unflagging control. Simply, and by simple means, a masterpiece. John Banville \u201cAmerican Express\u201d by James Salter (1988) The temporal shifts in James Salter\u2019s short fiction are its distinguishing glory. Decades unfold inside the beat of a sentence; a single moment might linger unspoken for many pages. Time seems to concertina, expanding and contracting to open out pockets of aromatic description. In \u201cAmerican Express\u201d, a pair of venal New York lawyers make a shabby killing and embark with their riches on a playboy jaunt through Italy, where one of them takes up with a schoolgirl. The story deals in oxymorons \u2013 bitter desire, weak power \u2013 and jolts to a conclusion that is harsh, cool, indelible. Kevin Barry \u201cParadise\u201d by Edna O\u2019Brien (2014) Key to a great short story is the tension and torsion created within each sentence. \u201cParadise\u201d combines remarkable disquiet, poetry and narrative drive. O\u2019Brien is a phenomenal architect of landscape, both physical and human, imbuing her setting with exact detail, lush discomfort, intrigue and counterintuitive fate. The main character, a nurse, has been taken to the overseas villa of her rich lover. Not only must she learn to swim and entertain his companions, she\u2019s interviewing \u2013 without any real prospect \u2013 for the position of wife. The story is lit with sexual chemistry, but travels a horribly misaligned path. Its true test lies in finding an exit from the female dream. Sarah Hall \u201cHands\u201d by Sherwood Anderson (1916) This is a strange, dark little story. Its charm comes from the eccentricities of its subject, former schoolteacher Wing Biddlebaum, since \u201cthe story of Wing Biddlebaum is a story of hands\u201d. Anderson evokes the Ohio town of Winesburg by focusing on the hands of its inhabitants. Wing\u2019s hands are \u201cslender, and forever trying to conceal themselves\u201d and he notices how the hands of those around him are \u201cquieter, inexpressive\u201d. And it\u2019s the wandering hands of Wing Biddlebaum, who has changed his name from Adolph Myers, that leads to the story\u2019s disturbing conclusion. Guy Gunaratne \u201cLet It Snow\u201d by David Sedaris (2003) Sedaris is in the fifth grade when heavy snow closes the schools. After a few days, his mother breaks down: \u201cGet the hell out of my house,\u201d she says, \u201cand stay out!\u201d. The little Sedarises go off sledding and return to find the door locked against them. They peer through the window to see their mother watching TV and glugging wine. \u2018Open the door,\u2019 they yell, \u2018it\u2019s us!\u2019. She closes the drapes on them. \u201cThat bitch!\u201d shouts a Sedaris sister. Fun turns to fear, mild sibling savagery follows and then, suddenly, it\u2019s OK again. A story \u2013 more memoir than fiction \u2013 that starts with the recognition that the very sight of you drives your mother to drink is attractive to me. But when it ends with that mother wading barelegged through five inches of snow to reach you, it\u2019s everything a story should be. It\u2019s The Sound of Music/Lord of the Flies/Owl Babies in a few short pages. He is a genius. Nina Stibbe. Reasons to Be Cheerful by Nina Stibbe will be published by Viking on 28 March. \u201cThe Distance of the Moon\u201d by Italo Calvino (1963) This is a gloriously sensual story, narrated by a man who wants another\u2019s wife \u2013 but the true star of the show is the moon. Calvino imagines it so close it risks dipping its scales in the sea. Fishermen gather lunar milk as the protagonist writhes in unrequited love. It is a great example of magic realism \u2013 full of texture and motion and mischief and longing. Leone Ross Come Let Us Sing Anyway, by Leone Ross, is published by Peepal Tree. * * * Contemporary and classic tales picked by Chris Power \u201cCivil Peace\u201d by Chinua Achebe (1971) Achebe didn\u2019t write many short stories (in the preface to his 1972 collection, Girls at War, he notes that \u201ca dozen pieces in twenty years must be accounted a pretty lean harvest by any reckoning\u201d), but his best are deeply memorable. \u201cCivil Peace\u201d takes place in the immediate aftermath of the Biafran war, and gives vivid life to the luck and misfortune experienced by Jonathan Iwegbu \u2013 an incorrigible optimist in a devastated society \u2013 and the surviving members of his family. \u201cIn a Bamboo Grove\u201d by Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa (1921) Akutagawa\u2019s ingenious riddle of a story takes the form of seven testimonies given to a magistrate in the course of a murder investigation. A samurai has been found dead in a bamboo grove, but the narrative doesn\u2019t end with the confession of the notorious bandit Taj\u014dmaru. Instead, two subsequent testimonies, that of the samurai\u2019s wife and of the samurai himself, via a spirit medium, contradict each other and the bandit\u2019s story, and ask the reader to turn investigator and puzzle out the truth. \u201cHappy Endings\u201d by Margaret Atwood (1983) Alice Munro once said: \u201cI want the story to exist somewhere so that in a way it\u2019s still happening \u2026 I don\u2019t want it to be shut up in the book and put away \u2013 oh well, that\u2019s what happened.\u201d Atwood articulates the same position in this fun, thought-provoking story that begins with a man meeting a woman, then offers variants of what happens next. Any ending that isn\u2019t death, she concludes, is false, and the interesting part of stories isn\u2019t what happens, but how and why. \u201cGoing to Meet the Man\u201d by James Baldwin (1965) A southern white deputy sheriff tries and fails to have sex with his wife. As she goes to sleep he talks about the vicious beating he gave a black protestor earlier that day, and returns to a deeper and even darker memory from his childhood: the ritual killing of a black man. After the killing, there was a picnic. Baldwin doesn\u2019t deny his character humanity, but as the story\u2019s shocking climax shows, neither does he forgive him. \u201cThe Garden of Forking Paths\u201d by Jorge Luis Borges (1941) When described in summary, there is a danger of reducing Borges to a collection of tropes: labyrinths, mirrors, invented books (he avoided \u201cthe madness of composing vast books\u201d by pretending they exist and writing commentaries on them). But with these elements he explored some of the most thrilling ideas in fiction. Labyrinths and strange books are both present here, as is a theory of existence that anticipates the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Extraordinarily, all these elements are enfolded within an account of a wartime espionage mission. \u201cThis Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen\u201d by Tadeusz Borowski (1946) From spring 1943 to summer 1944 the young Polish poet Borowski was a political prisoner in Auschwitz. His stories are some of the darkest documents in world literature. This one describes the narrator\u2019s first shift as a kapo unloading trains packed with Jewish men, women and children. Borowski\u2019s prose alternates between a blunt numbness and image making of extraordinary power. \u201cThe Company of Wolves\u201d by Angela Carter (1979) In The Bloody Chamber Angela Carter rewrote some of the best known fairytales \u2013 \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d, \u201cSnow White\u201d, \u201cBluebeard\u201d \u2013 challenging their assumptions about gender, sexual cruelty and morality. In \u201cThe Company of Wolves\u201d Red Riding Hood is no longer the meek victim of the wolf, but a woman of agency and courage who uses her sexuality to tame him. \u201cWhy Don\u2019t You Dance?\u201d by Raymond Carver (1981) The best Carver stories don\u2019t require the conventional techniques of exposition or backstory but create an extraordinary immediacy. Here we witness a man who has taken his furnishings and arranged them on his lawn: bed, couch, desk, turntable, lamp. It\u2019s all for sale, and as the man gets drunk with a young couple looking to furnish their apartment, we can guess how he has got here. But a hangnail of the unknowable remains, and stays long in the memory. \u201cThe Country Husband\u201d by John Cheever (1954) Cheever is known as a chronicler of the suburbs, but in this story the leafy neighbourhood of Shady Hill, a recurring location in his fiction, blends the domestic with something much stranger, almost magical. The story is comic (its title mirrors William Wycherley\u2019s 1675 comedy of manners The Country-Wife), but darker currents work beneath its surface and it builds to a stunning finale that is one of the most rapturous passages Cheever ever wrote. \u201cAn Outpost of Progress\u201d by Joseph Conrad (1897) Kayerts and Carlier, agents for the Great Trading Company, are \u201ctwo perfectly insignificant and incapable individuals\u201d left in charge of a remote trading station. Conrad mines a deep vein of irony as he describes their work \u201cserving the cause of progress\u201d. As the story unfolds, and the men are shown to be idiotic cogs in the engine of colonialism, Conrad exposes the gap between the high-flown language of such projects (\u201cprogress\u201d, \u201ccivilisation\u201d, \u201cvirtue\u201d) and their brutal reality. \u201cTwilight of the Superheroes\u201d by Deborah Eisenberg (2006) Eisenberg\u2019s story is high on the list of great literature about 9/11. Since the 1990s she has examined the effects of American power on the world and asked the question one of her characters asks here: \u201cHow far away does something have to be before you have the right to not really know about it?\u201d The attack on New York, that \u201cterrible day\u201d, although it seemed to come from nowhere, \u201chad been prepared for a long, long time, though it had been prepared behind a curtain\u201d. \u201cIn the Tunnel\u201d by Mavis Gallant (1971) Sarah\u2019s father sends her from Canada to Grenoble as a way of ending her relationship with a married professor, but she ends up on the French Riviera. There she meets Roy, an ex-prison inspector, and rashly moves in with him. The story\u2019s charge arises from a combination of wit, the awfulness of the relationship\u2019s collapse, and Gallant\u2019s profound grasp of the psychology of love affairs. She talks about her characters in a way that makes you feel your own perceptiveness is being worked like a muscle. \u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper\u201d by Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1892) During her lifetime Gilman was best known for her nonfiction, and she was forgotten after her suicide. Her fiction, in particular \u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper\u201d, was rediscovered in the 1970s by feminist academics. This chilling story takes the \u201cmadwoman\u201d figure of gothic fiction, memorably used by Charlotte Bront\u00eb in Jane Eyre, and describes her experience from the inside looking out. Having been told to avoid mental stimulation by her doctor following an episode of depression, Gilman wrote the story to \u201cconvince him of the error of his ways\u201d. \u201cThe Overcoat\u201d by Nikolai Gogol (1842) It is uncertain whether it was Turgenev or Dostoevsky who said, \u201cWe all came out from under Gogol\u2019s \u2018Overcoat\u2019\u201d, but his influence on those writers \u2013 as well as on Tolstoy, Kafka, Nabokov, Borges and many more \u2013 is profound. The main character of this bleakly hilarious story, the downtrodden government clerk Akaky Akakievich, is arguably the first antihero in modern literature, and his doomed pursuit of a new overcoat one of the most memorably absurd quests in fiction. \u201cSix Feet of the Country\u201d by Nadine Gordimer (1953) The reality of apartheid, and later the effects of its aftermath, dominates Gordimer\u2019s fiction. Here her narrator, who has escaped the tension of Johannesburg to play at farming in a rural suburb, becomes enraged when, following the death and autopsy of one of his workers\u2019 brothers, the authorities return the wrong body for burial. Despite his efforts to achieve justice, the story\u2019s final, bitterly ironic lines reveal that he is blind to his own racism. \u201cBig Two-Hearted River\u201d by Ernest Hemingway (1925) Hemingway\u2019s distinctive style \u2013 which John Updike described as \u201cgleaming economy and aggressive minimalism\u201d \u2013 is stunningly showcased here. Nick Adams\u2019s journey into the Michigan backwoods is also a journey into his own war-damaged psyche, and his unwillingness to fish the deep water of the swamp a resonant evocation of trauma. \u201cA Village After Dark\u201d by Kazuo Ishiguro (2001) The tension in this uncanny piece is stoked by Ishiguro\u2019s refusal to provide more than tantalising fragments of backstory. At nightfall an old man, Fletcher, arrives at a village where he once held great influence, but is now resented (\u201cI was mistaken about a lot of things,\u201d he admits). This might be an alternative Britain, or a future one. The dilapidated buildings and Fletcher\u2019s tramp-like appearance give the story a Beckettian feel, while its allegorical quality carries over to Ishiguro\u2019s novel The Buried Giant. \u201cThe Lottery\u201d by Shirley Jackson (1948) Asked to describe her writing, Jackson once noted its fascination with \u201cthe uncontrolled, unobserved wickedness of human behaviour\u201d. \u201cThe Lottery\u201d, in which a crowd gathers for a ceremony in the main square of a New England village on a sunny June morning, ends with one of the nastiest surprises in fiction. When the New Yorker printed the story it became the \u201cCat Person\u201d of its era as letters flooded in expressing admiration, disgust, and \u2013 unbelievably \u2013 concern that the gruesome story was true. \u201cEmergency\u201d by Denis Johnson (1991) Johnson\u2019s story begins in a hospital emergency room. It\u2019s the night shift, and Fuckhead (his nickname is the only name for him we get) and Georgie are taking care of hospital business while swallowing every pharmaceutical they can get their hands on. When their shift finishes, they drive into the countryside and reality unravels completely. Johnson rides a line between the sacred and the profane, between hilarity and sadness., and writes prose that will take your breath away \u201cAraby\u201d by James Joyce (1914) The stories in Dubliners divide into the four stages of life, and \u201cAraby\u201d encapsulates the turbulence and humiliation of adolescence in a boy\u2019s lonely night-time journey across Dublin to buy a gift for the girl he loves. \u201cA Bright Green Field\u201d by Anna Kavan (1958) If you love JG Ballard, you should read Anna Kavan. Few novelists, Ballard said, \u201ccould match the intensity of her vision\u201d, and that same intensity fuels her stories. The narrator of \u201cA Bright Green Field\u201d claims to encounter the same, unnaturally vivid field of grass wherever she goes. It\u2019s an unlikely candidate for a bete noire, but Kavan\u2019s descriptions of a mountain town in the gathering gloom, loomed over by \u201cthe sheer emerald wall that was the meadow\u201d, create an atmosphere of powerful unease. \u201cExtra\u201d by Yiyun Li (2003) Granny Lin is 51, and doesn\u2019t know when everyone started calling her granny. Working as a maid at a boarding school in the Beijing suburbs she develops feelings for six-year-old Kang, a rich man\u2019s illegitimate son, an unwanted \u201cextra\u201d who \u201chas to be got rid of\u201d. Granny Lin\u2019s love is complicated; is it maternal, or is it perhaps the great romance she missed out on in her youth? Li has a Chekhovian ability to disappear from the text, allowing a remarkable intensity to develop between reader and story. \u201cThe Husband Stitch\u201d by Carmen Maria Machado (2014) Machado takes a grisly campfire tale (\u201cThe Green Ribbon\u201d), combines it with the purported medical practice of suturing a woman\u2019s perineum with an extra stitch or two after childbirth to increase her husband\u2019s pleasure, and creates a powerful modern fable about misogyny and motherhood. Before her wedding day, as Machado expertly builds the atmosphere of foreboding, the narrator notes that, \u201cBrides never fare well in stories. Stories can sense happiness and snuff it out like a candle\u201d. \u201cMadame Tellier\u2019s House\u201d by Guy de Maupassant (1881) Maupassant, probably the only short-story writer as influential as Chekhov, wrote in two modes: short, impressively constructed but one-dimensional stories with trick endings (\u201cThe Necklace\u201d is the most famous of these), and longer, more interesting work. He wrote \u201cMadame Tellier\u2019s House\u201d after a friend reported passing a brothel in Rouen with a sign on its door saying, \u201cClosed because of First Communion\u201d. His expansion on this irresistible detail resulted in one of his greatest stories. \u201cA Horse and Two Goats\u201d by RK Narayan (1970) Narayan, who wrote more than 200 short stories, called them \u201cconcentrated miniatures of human experience in all its opulence\u201d. The opulence of the clay horse at the centre of this story has faded beneath the Indian sun, but the conversation it triggers between an American tourist who speaks no Tamil and Muni, a poor peasant who speaks no English, is not only very funny, but also telling about the degree to which misunderstanding is an unavoidable part of human interaction. \u201cMinutes of Glory\u201d by Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong\u2019o (1976) This story by Kenya\u2019s most prominent writer follows the struggles of barmaid Beatrice as she works in a succession of increasingly seedy establishments. Men prey on her, buying her body as if it were \u201ca bag of potatoes or a sack of cabbages\u201d, and her hopes of living the high life in Nairobi become more unlikely by the day. \u201cShe fought life with dreams,\u201d Ng\u0169g\u0129 writes, and through a reckless action Beatrice\u2019s fantasies briefly become reality before the story reaches its sorrowful conclusion. \u201cA Good Man Is Hard to Find\u201d by Flannery O\u2019Connor (1953) This story is a vicious and darkly funny account of a family\u2019s encounter with a criminal gang led by the psychotic Misfit. Its closing lines, and the apparent act of grace they describe, are as memorable as they are ambiguous. \u201cWe Didn\u2019t Like Him\u201d by Akhil Sharma (2013) Two boys grow up together on a lane in Delhi. One, the narrator, becomes a lawyer. The other, Manshu, becomes pandit of the local temple. The narrator\u2019s burgeoning dislike for Manshu, the way the events of life bring them back into contact with one another, the Hindu burial process and the mechanics of \u201cputting someone in the Ganges\u201d: these elements are so absorbingly animated that the story\u2019s emotional impact, when it arrives, feels like an ambush. \u201cHeads of the Colored People: Four Fancy Sketches, Two Chalk Outlines, and No Apology\u201d by Nafissa Thompson-Spires (2015) Police shoot two black men outside a comic-book convention in LA, while halfway across the country an artist buys his daughter a cupcake at a vegan bakery. Thompson-Spires\u2019s self-reflexive story is \u201cangry, like a big black fist\u201d, but it\u2019s also breathtaking in the way it loops back and forth in time and constantly second-guesses the reader\u2019s assumptions. \u201cSmote (or When I Find I Cannot Kiss You in Front of a Print by Bridget Riley)\u201d by Eley Williams (2015) \u201cTo kiss you,\u201d this story begins, \u201cshould not involve such fear of precision.\u201d Williams\u2019s story is less a stream of consciousness than a barrelling wave, as a woman debates whether or not to kiss her girlfriend in an art gallery, and all the doubt, thrill, uncertainty, hilarity and panic of love is compressed into a few seconds of indecision.",

      "body": "<p>After an encounter with a painting that shares exactly the \u201csurly, boastful look\u201d of herself as an 11-year-old, the narrator of this intriguing novel admits: \u201cI know, I know, this is about as far from hard-nosed criticism as you can get, but isn\u2019t all artwork \u2013 or all decent art \u2013 a mirror? [\u2026] Isn\u2019t theory also in some sense always autobiography?\u201d The narrator is called Mar\u00eda, like the author, and this book would appear to inhabit the territory of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/23/drawn-from-life-why-have-novelists-stopped-making-things-up\" title=\"\">autofiction</a>; in it she reflects, in glimpses and fragments, on motherhood, childhood, adolescent friendship, strained familial relationships. Most of all she reflects on paintings and painters: it is this, above, all, that matters to her, and that gives shape to her digressive, intricately woven narrative. As a guide and critic, she is excellent company \u2013 wry, astute, self-deprecating. Her sphere of reference is broad and catholic, the book flecked with quotations. The prose, in Thomas Bunstead\u2019s translation, is restrained, funny, by turns (and at once) luminous and melancholy. I was put in mind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/04/kudos-rachel-cusk-review\" title=\"\">Rachel Cusk\u2019s Faye trilogy</a>, for this and for the anecdotal, allusive structure. The text moves fluently between art criticism and history, biography, anecdote, memory and the imagined past.</p> <p>To encounter art in a gallery, Mar\u00eda advises, \u201ckeep your eyes unfocused to begin with\u201d and be open to the \u201cfirst jolt\u201d. She is interested above all in the subjective experience of art, and all that we bring to that encounter: \u201cbodily\u201d, unconscious, associative and subrational responses. An equally astute and curious attention is devoted to lesser known or now forgotten artists, as much as to Toulouse-Lautrec, Rousseau and El Greco. Even the more familiar names tend to be those of artists who were in some way peripheral, disdained or iconoclastic in their own lifetimes. This is a book fascinated by the passage of time, the fragility of fame and the possibility of art\u2019s endurance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0fe66b3ca8080b9243afeca020bff6885120e543\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fe66b3ca8080b9243afeca020bff6885120e543/0_0_5200_3575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Dream by Henri Rousseau (1910).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Dream by Henri Rousseau (1910).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Barritt/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reader might feel compelled to put it down and go in search of a reference point, an image of the painting in question.

But it certainly isn\u2019t necessary to be familiar with the works Mar\u00eda contemplates: ekphrasis, at least in the conventional sense, isn\u2019t quite the objective here.

Gainza is an established art critic in her native Argentina, and writes with authority and precision about technique, style and context. And her subject is as much the possibility and the limits of writing or talking about art \u2013 in response to Rothko: \u201cRarely do the inadequacies of language become so patently obvious. All you really want to say is \u2018Fuck me\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Each chapter is discrete, and the connections between narrative strands are often oblique; a motif (the sea, animals), or a concern with, for example, the quest for and meaning of success, will tie together memories, imagined scenes, stories of lost friends and artistic commissions: an aristocratic relative \u201cin his boudoir\u201d, Richard Burton\u2019s encounter with a \u201cskinny dog\u201d in Paraguay. But <em>Optic Nerve</em> as a whole is not merely episodic. It becomes richer and more complex, until a self-portrait of the narrator emerges \u2013 layered, realised as much in what is left undeveloped or partial, and culminating in something quite unexpected, which loops us back to the start and casts new light on the pall of anxiety and sadness that has shaded the text.

But it is through the gaps, through juxtaposition and elision, that our own encounter with the book takes place; they invite us to make connections, to shift our focus and attention and pick out details. As John Berger writes in <em>Ways of Seeing</em>: \u201cWe are never looking at just one thing; we are always looking at the relation between things and ourselves.

      "body": "<p>I moved to Washington DC in 2008 after graduating from university, where I studied journalism, and naively proclaimed I would have nothing to do with politics. It was a world that seemed so cynical and inaccessible, and at first I didn\u2019t fully grasp what role the media ought to play in holding to account people in positions of power. But Barack Obama\u2019s election swiftly reinforced how political reporters have a front-row seat on history\u2013 stenographers for moments that will be looked back upon for generations to come. I got my start covering the Obama White House and the 2012 presidential election, and it\u2019s safe to say there\u2019s never been a dull moment since. <br><br>One of the prevailing challenges of reporting in the Trump era has been trying not to let the president dictate the terms of the news cycle. After nearly two years, it\u2019s hard to say if anyone has yet figured out how to really cover Trump; it\u2019s still the case that one tweet can derail the entire news cycle. It\u2019s a reality-TV presidency, and we\u2019re all tuned in for every twist and turn, not knowing what to expect in the next episode.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/28/government-shutdown-cost-us-economy-11bn\">Government shutdown cost US economy $11bn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even as I write this piece, Trump appears to have defied precedent by leading the country into the longest government shutdown in US history \u2013 all because Congress refused his demand for billions of dollars in funding toward the construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border.<br><br>The partial closure of the government has provided yet another reminder that the key to covering Trump is to press on with the core storylines that have defined Trump\u2019s tenure \u2013 be it his draconian agenda on immigration, the isolation of America on the global stage, or the recurring hints of corruption and efforts to undermine the institutions that hold the US government together. The standards have been lowered for what is and isn\u2019t acceptable, in large part due to the kind of rhetoric Trump has injected into the mainstream. There\u2019s a tendency now to say, \u201cit\u2019s just Trump being Trump\u201d; but if this were any other president, any one of these daily controversies would be a months-long scandal.</p> <p>The government shutdown, for example, has dragged on for more than a month, leaving roughly 800,000 federal workers without pay since 22 December. It has impacted on air travel across the country, imperilled food and drug inspections and threatened the delivery of food stamps and other anti-poverty programmes. And yet, on most days it no longer leads the news in Trump\u2019s Washington.</p> <p>How the media frames the president and his actions is vital to the public\u2019s understanding of where he fits into a historical context and his role in the breakdown of norms.<br><br>There\u2019s even more curiosity in what lies ahead now that House Democrats have vowed to restore oversight of the executive branch; in other words, to act as the check and balance that Republicans ignored almost entirely in Trump\u2019s first two years.<br><br>The reality is that with Republicans still in control of the Senate, there certainly has been no sudden shift in terms of the status quo. The partisan battle lines are sharply drawn, as evidenced by the ongoing shutdown.</p> <p>But Democrats have more leverage, with their newfound House majority, to hold the line on progressive priorities as part of any negotiations, particularly on must-pass spending bills that outline how government funds are allocated. (See their refusal to fund a border wall.) Democrats are in a position to essentially block any of Trump\u2019s agenda with which they disagree \u2013 which is just about everything.<br><br>There\u2019s no question that the president\u2019s legal troubles are mounting. After recent revelations, it will be interesting to see how Democrats decide to use their investigative authorities, which come with considerable power to subpoena documents and witnesses. They\u2019ve already suggested they will go after Trump\u2019s tax returns, business dealings in Russia, hush payments to women, conflicts of interest among White House officials, and misuse of taxpayer dollars by cabinet officials, among other things. It\u2019s going to be quite a wild ride.<br><br>It\u2019s not opinion to state that the president has used his platform to demonise minority ethnic immigrants, it\u2019s a fact.He has drawn a repeated link between minority ethnic immigrants and crime, even though numerous studies show that the immigrant community in the US is less likely to commit violent crime when compared with the native-born population. He has also seized on the international criminal gang MS-13 to stoke fears around those crossing the US-Mexico border, even though MS-13 members make up less than 1% of the approximately 1.4 million gang members in America. <br><br>And therein lies the key for me as a journalist: The most powerful tools we have at our disposal are the facts. Rather than getting swept up in the narrative Trump is trying to set, we have been tasked with challenging it when his words are at odds with the truth.<br><br>As a Muslim American born to Pakistani parents, I do believe there is a certain perspective I can bring to conversations around what is and isn\u2019t covered, or how certain stories perhaps should be covered. Although I\u2019m a reporter first, I\u2019ve spoken often about the lack of diversity in the US media, which is especially glaring in political reporting. There are so many times when I look around \u2013 whether it\u2019s in the White House briefing room, on the campaign trail, or at the Capitol \u2013 and realise I\u2019m the only Muslim there. <br><br>That feeling is more pronounced on some occasions, such as when Trump retweeted a series of anti-Muslim videos by the far-right group Britain First. Those are the days where I have to remind myself that challenging the president is not inherently adversarial or biased, but, due to the lack of Muslim voices covering the White House, my duty to contribute to the conversation in a way I am uniquely positioned to do. On that occasion, I tweeted a list of all that anti-Muslim statements he had made to demonstrate that this was not out of character for him. It\u2019s part of who he is.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/26/trump-travel-ban-supreme-court-ruling-explained\">Trump's travel ban: what does the supreme court ruling mean?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I also contributed to a lot of our coverage around the president\u2019s travel ban, which for me was an opportunity to rely upon my ties to the Muslim community to better demonstrate how real people were affected. I did a piece where I paid a visit to the mosque where Barack Obama spoke as president, in part to highlight how much had changed for that particular community since Trump was elected. I spent time with a Syrian refugee family in Charlottesville, Virginia, to show the impact of his travel ban on those who were separated from their children.<br><br>Reporting on US politics is an extremely competitive space, more so now than in the past. What\u2019s been encouraging is the largely positive feedback from US readers who don\u2019t simply dismiss the Guardian as a foreign outlet but see us as part of the conversation. Often people I encounter here in Washington tell me they find the Guardian\u2019s issue-based coverage to rank among the best. Whether it\u2019s on climate, immigration, criminal justice or gun control, there are viral areas where we\u2019ve been able to carve out a niche and have considerable impact.<br><br>I would not have predicted that I\u2019d ever be covering a Trump presidency. But I\u2019ll be watching how Democrats leverage their majority in the House, and whether they are willing to fully utilise their investigative powers against Trump. During the 2020 campaign cycle, Democrats will probably face challenges from what is shaping up to be a very large field of potential candidates. The party will need to be more unified, particularly to take on a behemoth like Trump; it shouldn\u2019t be assumed by anyone that he won\u2019t be given a second term.<br><br></p>",

The government shutdown, for example, has dragged on for more than a month, leaving roughly 800,000 federal workers without pay since 22 December. It has impacted on air travel across the country, imperilled food and drug inspections and threatened the delivery of food stamps and other anti-poverty programmes. And yet, on most days it no longer leads the news in Trump\u2019s Washington. How the media frames the president and his actions is vital to the public\u2019s understanding of where he fits into a historical context and his role in the breakdown of norms. There\u2019s even more curiosity in what lies ahead now that House Democrats have vowed to restore oversight of the executive branch; in other words, to act as the check and balance that Republicans ignored almost entirely in Trump\u2019s first two years. The reality is that with Republicans still in control of the Senate, there certainly has been no sudden shift in terms of the status quo. The partisan battle lines are sharply drawn, as evidenced by the ongoing shutdown. But Democrats have more leverage, with their newfound House majority, to hold the line on progressive priorities as part of any negotiations, particularly on must-pass spending bills that outline how government funds are allocated. (See their refusal to fund a border wall.) Democrats are in a position to essentially block any of Trump\u2019s agenda with which they disagree \u2013 which is just about everything. There\u2019s no question that the president\u2019s legal troubles are mounting. After recent revelations, it will be interesting to see how Democrats decide to use their investigative authorities, which come with considerable power to subpoena documents and witnesses. They\u2019ve already suggested they will go after Trump\u2019s tax returns, business dealings in Russia, hush payments to women, conflicts of interest among White House officials, and misuse of taxpayer dollars by cabinet officials, among other things. It\u2019s going to be quite a wild ride. It\u2019s not opinion to state that the president has used his platform to demonise minority ethnic immigrants, it\u2019s a fact.He has drawn a repeated link between minority ethnic immigrants and crime, even though numerous studies show that the immigrant community in the US is less likely to commit violent crime when compared with the native-born population. He has also seized on the international criminal gang MS-13 to stoke fears around those crossing the US-Mexico border, even though MS-13 members make up less than 1% of the approximately 1.4 million gang members in America. And therein lies the key for me as a journalist: The most powerful tools we have at our disposal are the facts. Rather than getting swept up in the narrative Trump is trying to set, we have been tasked with challenging it when his words are at odds with the truth. As a Muslim American born to Pakistani parents, I do believe there is a certain perspective I can bring to conversations around what is and isn\u2019t covered, or how certain stories perhaps should be covered. Although I\u2019m a reporter first, I\u2019ve spoken often about the lack of diversity in the US media, which is especially glaring in political reporting. There are so many times when I look around \u2013 whether it\u2019s in the White House briefing room, on the campaign trail, or at the Capitol \u2013 and realise I\u2019m the only Muslim there. That feeling is more pronounced on some occasions, such as when Trump retweeted a series of anti-Muslim videos by the far-right group Britain First. Those are the days where I have to remind myself that challenging the president is not inherently adversarial or biased, but, due to the lack of Muslim voices covering the White House, my duty to contribute to the conversation in a way I am uniquely positioned to do. On that occasion, I tweeted a list of all that anti-Muslim statements he had made to demonstrate that this was not out of character for him. It\u2019s part of who he is. I also contributed to a lot of our coverage around the president\u2019s travel ban, which for me was an opportunity to rely upon my ties to the Muslim community to better demonstrate how real people were affected. I did a piece where I paid a visit to the mosque where Barack Obama spoke as president, in part to highlight how much had changed for that particular community since Trump was elected. I spent time with a Syrian refugee family in Charlottesville, Virginia, to show the impact of his travel ban on those who were separated from their children. Reporting on US politics is an extremely competitive space, more so now than in the past. What\u2019s been encouraging is the largely positive feedback from US readers who don\u2019t simply dismiss the Guardian as a foreign outlet but see us as part of the conversation. Often people I encounter here in Washington tell me they find the Guardian\u2019s issue-based coverage to rank among the best. Whether it\u2019s on climate, immigration, criminal justice or gun control, there are viral areas where we\u2019ve been able to carve out a niche and have considerable impact. I would not have predicted that I\u2019d ever be covering a Trump presidency. But I\u2019ll be watching how Democrats leverage their majority in the House, and whether they are willing to fully utilise their investigative powers against Trump. During the 2020 campaign cycle, Democrats will probably face challenges from what is shaping up to be a very large field of potential candidates. The party will need to be more unified, particularly to take on a behemoth like Trump; it shouldn\u2019t be assumed by anyone that he won\u2019t be given a second term.",

But this will deteriorate, and carpet fitters often remove it around skirting boards.</p> <p>Buckingham and Ian Jones, another thermal imaging surveyor, say tests are often \u201cbodged\u201d in this way. This can render energy efficiency ratings meaningless. Between them they have tested thousands of new homes in recent years, and say virtually all leak air, to a greater or lesser extent.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778817322612\" title=\"\">2017 research paper</a> by Dr Jenny Love and others from UCL Energy Institute, which analysed results from 144,024 homes tested under the ATTMA (Air Tightness Testing &amp; Measurement Association) scheme, came up with similar findings.</p> <p>\u201cThe result of meeting the target through temporary sealing, which fails after a short time, is that for most of a dwelling\u2019s lifetime, air permeability will be higher than the design value,\u201d the paper said. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/07/competition-authority-to-examine-warranties-for-new-homes\" title=\"\">NHBC</a>, the main standard-setting body and warranty provider for new homes, says it is not aware of the use of mastic or other fillers to ensure air leakage tests are met.</p> <p>Barry Cope of the ATTMA says building regulations are too lax. The maximum allowed leakage is the equivalent of a 20p-sized hole in every square metre of wall \u2013 \u201ca huge amount of air leakage\u201d \u2013 which gives an <a href=\"http://www.nhbc.co.uk/ProductsandServices/ConsultancyandTesting/Airleakageservices/documents/filedownload,38528,en.pdf\" title=\"\">air test result of 10</a>.

A test costs from \u00a3170 plus VAT.</p> <p>Cope says: \u201cWith building regulations not likely to change in the near future, it is difficult to try to convince some housebuilders that spending that bit of time doing the work to a much higher standard is worth the ever so slight reduction in profit.\u201d</p> <h2>Case studies</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67f210d866edaffd1542c5039455dbc6dff10b04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67f210d866edaffd1542c5039455dbc6dff10b04/0_0_640_480/500.jpg\" alt=\"Thermal imaging picture showing gaps in plasterboard\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thermal imaging picture showing gaps in plasterboard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Buckingham</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Guardian Money attended a thermal imaging survey of a five-bedroom David Wilson-built house in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, by Paul Buckingham on behalf of the homeowner, Mick Wilkinson. It showed air infiltration in many areas, including behind the bedroom and hall walls. Several walls lacked full insulation. There were also considerable draughts.</p> <p>\u201cThe external walls were reasonably well sealed along the tops but the corners were all found to be unsealed behind the dry lining. This is a source of heat loss \u2026 due to free-flowing air within the building structure,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>Wilkinson says the \u00a3770,000 house, completed in December 2017, came with nearly 300 snags, many of which are still unresolved, and declares: \u201cIt\u2019s the first new-build I bought, and the last.\u201d</p> <p>Barratt, which owns David Wilson Homes, says: \u201cWhen we do occasionally get things wrong, we try to put them right as quickly as possible.

Buckingham\u2019s report, on behalf of a housing association tenant, Charlotte Webb, says: \u201cHeating costs are significantly higher than estimates and the property is consistently cold.\u201d Webb also complains of a severe lack of sound insulation.</p> <p>Taylor Wimpey says: \u201cThe property met, and in fact outperformed, building regulations for air permeability when it was completed. Since then, we have not had any issues raised regarding airtightness but we would be very happy to look into this.\u201d</p> <p>It says it arranged for an independent acoustic test but this was \u201cprematurely halted by the resident\u201d.

But what thermal imaging surveyors and other building experts are discovering is that widespread poor installation of plasterboard has resulted in the airtightness suffering badly. Housebuilders rush to meet targets (their own and the government\u2019s), often cutting corners, and airtightness suffers as a result. The plasterboard is attached to masonry with adhesive. But Paul Buckingham, a thermal imaging surveyor, says housebuilders often cut costs using \u201cdot and dab\u201d adhesive, rather than solid dabbing. Thermal imaging often finds air pockets behind plasterboard walls, causing cold spots and reduced thermal efficiency. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any of this airflow in old houses,\u201d he says. \u201cIn those built in the 60s and 70s, with concrete floors, the airtightness is pretty good.\u201d (However, they may leak air elsewhere \u2013 through open trickle ventilators or fireplaces.) Going even further back, case studies undertaken in 2011 by energy consultant Diane Hubbard found that most of the houses built before 1900 were more airtight than expected, and in some cases better than required by the 2006 building regulations, and \u201cmodern extensions may not be as airtight as the original building\u201d. To ensure new homes pass air leakage tests \u2013 mandatory in England and Wales since 2006 \u2013 some developers may seal gaps with mastic or decorator\u2019s caulk. But this will deteriorate, and carpet fitters often remove it around skirting boards. Buckingham and Ian Jones, another thermal imaging surveyor, say tests are often \u201cbodged\u201d in this way. This can render energy efficiency ratings meaningless. Between them they have tested thousands of new homes in recent years, and say virtually all leak air, to a greater or lesser extent. A 2017 research paper by Dr Jenny Love and others from UCL Energy Institute, which analysed results from 144,024 homes tested under the ATTMA (Air Tightness Testing &amp; Measurement Association) scheme, came up with similar findings. \u201cThe result of meeting the target through temporary sealing, which fails after a short time, is that for most of a dwelling\u2019s lifetime, air permeability will be higher than the design value,\u201d the paper said. NHBC, the main standard-setting body and warranty provider for new homes, says it is not aware of the use of mastic or other fillers to ensure air leakage tests are met. Barry Cope of the ATTMA says building regulations are too lax. The maximum allowed leakage is the equivalent of a 20p-sized hole in every square metre of wall \u2013 \u201ca huge amount of air leakage\u201d \u2013 which gives an air test result of 10. New homes usually aim for a reading below five, while a passive house is close to zero. In addition, the regulations allow sample testing, which means a large number of new homes are never tested. The quality of air testing \u2013 the lack of proper training and qualifications \u2013 is another issue. A test costs from \u00a3170 plus VAT. Cope says: \u201cWith building regulations not likely to change in the near future, it is difficult to try to convince some housebuilders that spending that bit of time doing the work to a much higher standard is worth the ever so slight reduction in profit.\u201d Case studies Guardian Money attended a thermal imaging survey of a five-bedroom David Wilson-built house in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, by Paul Buckingham on behalf of the homeowner, Mick Wilkinson. It showed air infiltration in many areas, including behind the bedroom and hall walls. Several walls lacked full insulation. There were also considerable draughts. \u201cThe external walls were reasonably well sealed along the tops but the corners were all found to be unsealed behind the dry lining. This is a source of heat loss \u2026 due to free-flowing air within the building structure,\u201d the report says. Wilkinson says the \u00a3770,000 house, completed in December 2017, came with nearly 300 snags, many of which are still unresolved, and declares: \u201cIt\u2019s the first new-build I bought, and the last.\u201d Barratt, which owns David Wilson Homes, says: \u201cWhen we do occasionally get things wrong, we try to put them right as quickly as possible. We are in direct contact with Mr Wilkinson and remain committed to resolving these issues as quickly as possible.\u201d Another thermal imaging survey at a maisonette in Buntingford, East Hertfordshire, built by Taylor Wimpey in 2016, found draughts flowing from under all the skirtings and in the bathroom in the middle of the flat. Buckingham\u2019s report, on behalf of a housing association tenant, Charlotte Webb, says: \u201cHeating costs are significantly higher than estimates and the property is consistently cold.\u201d Webb also complains of a severe lack of sound insulation. Taylor Wimpey says: \u201cThe property met, and in fact outperformed, building regulations for air permeability when it was completed. Since then, we have not had any issues raised regarding airtightness but we would be very happy to look into this.\u201d It says it arranged for an independent acoustic test but this was \u201cprematurely halted by the resident\u201d. It is happy to complete it and any additional air testing.",

Shelly Chopra Dhar\u2019s film, a groundbreaker in the garb of a crowdpleaser, is a light comedy of errors (tangentially inspired by PG Wodehouse\u2019s A Damsel in Distress) shot in eye-caressing pastels, with a smattering of keening songs and the reassuring star presence of father-daughter pairing Anil Kapoor and Sonam Kapoor Ahuja.

Simply load up your personal details, and then sit back knowing that you are paying some of the lowest gas and electricity prices around. And the best bit? You will never have to search out the cheapest energy supplier again, because someone else will do it for you. That\u2019s the promise from a host of \u201cflipping\u201d energy services. However, Guardian Money has found that customers could find themselves overpaying a firm with a poor customer service record or find the savings are eaten up by fees. We also found that while savings can be made, they are not as much as if you do it yourself. For the lazy householder, the sites can make sense, but with only a smidgen more effort you\u2019ll save a lot more. Until last October the flipping services were relatively small affairs but the entry of Weflip, owned by the switching giant GoCompare, has transformed the market. The Weflip adverts featuring a chameleon have been rarely off TV screens for months now, and will have left many wondering whether it\u2019s worth signing up to the service \u2013 or to rivals such as Flipper and Look After My Bills. So how does flipping work? The sites say that once you have entered your fuel usage patterns, existing tariff, your postcode and your payment details, they will find you the best deal and switch you to that firm. They will then keep checking the market on your behalf and every time there is a price change, and they spot a deal that could make you a saving of \u00a350 a year or more, they will automatically switch you to that supplier. You get an email notification that it is happening. However, most people will still need to take meter readings, although developments in smart meters may ease the process. For those who cannot be bothered to keep switching suppliers, these sites should be a boon. Such households are typically overpaying by about \u00a3200 a year, or more if they have a large family. But do you want to hand over control of a major household bill to an outside firm that frankly is there to maximise its profits? The existing switching sites have long made their money by moving customers to an energy provider that pays them a commission \u2013 typically \u00a350-\u00a370 for a dual-fuel customer. The problem is the very cheapest suppliers do not pay these inducements, so the flipping sites are unlikely to shift you to these best-buy deals. This week Money tested the major flipping sites. We used a property whose electricity and gas bills are both with British Gas on its standard tariff, totalling \u00a31,132. Firstly we independently determined the best tariff currently available in the market, using the Energyhelpline.com website. The very cheapest was Outfox the Market at \u00a3905, which is a good saving, but we decided against it because of its poor customer service record. We decided the best all-round value was Northumbria Energy at \u00a3922 a year. So what would the flipping services take us to? First we tried Weflip and after entering our details it said it would switch us to Toto Energy, and that our annual cost would be \u00a3961. But last October it emerged that Toto Energy was bottom in the Citizens Advice league table for customer service. MoneySavingExpert has been highly critical of its \u201cnightmare service\u201d, and Ofgem was forced to intervene last summer. So why was Weflip sending us to them? Weflip said its direct relationships with partners enable it to monitor performance, \u201cas well as regularly reviewing customer feedback\u201d.

Each of these tariffs would cost just over \u00a31,000 a year in our test, which is a saving of up to \u00a3125 a year over British Gas. If you are regularly monitoring your home energy bills and switching when necessary, these sites are not for you. Could they work for others? Probably, as long as you check the deal to which you are being moved. But does that not rather defeat the object of the exercise? \u2022 This article was amended on 8 February 2019. An earlier version said that Flipper charges a \u00a325 fee per switch. In fact the company charges an annual subscription. Since publication the company has raised the annual fee from \u00a325 to \u00a330. \u2022 See if you can switch supplier and save money with the Guardian",

Setting out merely to connect us, Facebook found itself in possession of our deepest secrets. And in seeking to survive commercially beyond their initial goals, these companies realised they were sitting on a new kind of asset: our \u201cbehavioural surplus\u201d, the totality of information about our every thought, word and deed, which could be traded for profit in new markets based on predicting our every need \u2013 or producing it. In a move of such audacity that it bears comparison to the enclosure of the commons or colonial conquests, the tech giants unilaterally declared that these previously untapped resources were theirs for the taking, and brushed aside every objection. While insisting that their technology is too complex to be legislated, there are companies that have poured billions into lobbying against oversight, and while building empires on publicly funded data and the details of our private lives they have repeatedly rejected established norms of societal responsibility and accountability. And what is crucially different about this new form of exploitation and exceptionalism is that beyond merely strip-mining our intimate inner lives, it seeks to shape, direct and control them. Their operations transpose the total control over production pioneered by industrial capitalism to every aspect of everyday life.</p> <p>The extraction is so grotesque, so creepy, that it is almost impossible to see how anyone who really thinks about it lives with it \u2013 and yet we do. There\u2019s something about its opacity, its insidiousness, that makes it hard to think about, just as it\u2019s hard to think about climate change, a process that will inevitably undo society as we currently understand it, yet is experienced by many of us as slightly better weather. Likewise the benefits of faster search results and turn-by-turn directions mask the deeper, destructive predations of what Shoshana Zuboff terms \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d, a force that is as profoundly undemocratic as it is exploitative, yet remains poorly understood. As she details in her important new book, ignorance of its operation is one of the central strategies of this regime, and yet the tide is turning: more and more people express their unease about the surveillance economy and, disturbed by the fractious, alienated and trustless social sphere it generates, are seeking alternatives. It will be a long, slow and difficult process to extricate ourselves from the toxic products of both industrial and surveillance capitalism, but its cause is assisted by the weighty analysis provided by books such as this. Combining in-depth technical understanding and a broad, humanistic scope, Zuboff has written what may prove to be the first definitive account of the economic \u2013 and thus social and political \u2013 condition of our age.</p> <p>Zuboff is no stranger to this territory. In her 1988 book<em><a href=\"http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/new/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/\" title=\"\"> In the Age of the Smart Machine</a></em>, she addressed at the moment of their appearance in the business world many of the issues that have come to achieve dominance in our everyday life. Embedded within a large pharmaceutical company in the 1980s, she observed first-hand how new tools for internal communication, first welcomed by employees as novel social spaces in which they could better converse, plan and access information, were gradually recognised as tools for management intrusion and control. Aspects of employees\u2019 personal experience that were implicit and private suddenly became explicit and public, were exposed to scrutiny and made the basis for evaluation, criticism and punishment. Now it is the interiors of all our lives that are exposed to invisible overseers, who do not merely profit from our actions, but increasingly control their every expression.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Players think they are playing one game \u2013 collecting Pok\u00e9mon \u2013 while they are in fact pawns in an entirely different one</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Consider the apparently benign game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/05/playing-pokemon-go-crashed-car-experience\" title=\"\">Pok\u00e9mon Go</a>, both a ridiculous and a transparent example of the link between behavioural surplus and physical control. While its initial players lauded the game for its incitement to head outside into the \u201creal world\u201d, they in fact stumbled straight into an entirely fabricated reality, one based on years of conditioning human motivation through reward systems, and designed to herd its users towards commercial opportunities. Within days of the game\u2019s launch in 2016, its creators revealed that attractive virtual locations were for sale to the highest bidder, inking profitable deals with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/20/pokemon-go-japan-launch-delayed-mcdonalds-sponsorship-gyms\" title=\"\">McDonald\u2019s</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/08/pokemon-go-is-officially-teaming-with-starbucks-for-7800-new-gyms-and-pokestops/\" title=\"\">Starbucks</a> and others to direct Pok\u00e9mon hunters to their front doors. The players think they are playing one game \u2013 collecting Pok\u00e9mon \u2013 while they are in fact playing an entirely different one, in which the board is invisible but they are the pawns. And Pok\u00e9mon Go is but one tiny probe extending out from Google and others\u2019 vast capabilities to tune and manipulate human action at scale: a global means of behaviour modification entirely owned and operated by private enterprise.</p> <p>The efficacy of Pok\u00e9mon Go in impelling and directing human behaviour recalls nothing so strongly as the psychologist BF Skinner\u2019s development of operant conditioning, and Skinner is one of many figures Zuboff evokes, implicates and critiques in her narrative. Skinner developed and perfected a technology of behaviour modification in living organisms, and extrapolated from it a politics rooted in total social control. Published in 1971, his incendiary treatise Beyond Freedom and Dignity prescribed a future of behavioural modification and redirection which rejected the very idea of freedom, replacing it with guaranteed outcomes and individual conformity. But while the targets of operant conditioning in the 20th century were always construed as \u201cthem\u201d \u2013 enemies, prisoners and social misfits \u2013 and its implications were the subject of revulsion and rejection by a public fearful of \u201cmind control\u201d, the targets of the same logic today are all of us, and its possibilities have been embraced at the highest level, from the boardrooms of the most powerful corporations to governments seeking to both \u201cnudge\u201d their populations towards \u201cbetter\u201d decisions, and to surveil their inner moods and desires for any signs of deviance, dissent or radical intent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a71fc6bdda9921a512c46125c75e8987bfffda1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a71fc6bdda9921a512c46125c75e8987bfffda1/0_100_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Go with the crowd \u2026 people play Pok\u00e9mon Go at Yokohama Stadium in Japan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Go with the crowd \u2026 people play Pok\u00e9mon Go at Yokohama Stadium in Japan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Zuboff, this dread force is not merely a higher expression of capitalism, but a perversion of it, and while some might regard that as special pleading, she is at pains to clarify where it differs from more equitable and mutually beneficial forms. As a consequence of placing her analysis within economic theory and a wider history of both capitalism and totalitarianism, she introduces a number of useful terms into the discussion which do much to move it forward. Much of the debate around Google, Facebook and their ilk, for example, has been framed in terms of privacy \u2013 as mere control over information about the self \u2013 and while many of these arguments are venerable and well-articulated, they\u2019ve also been mostly lost. It seems people are very willing to give up their private information in return for perceived benefits such as ease of use, navigation and access to friends and information. Zuboff recasts the conversation around privacy as one over \u201cdecision rights\u201d: the agency we can actively assert over our own futures, which is fundamentally usurped by predictive, data-driven systems. Engaging with the systems of surveillance capitalism, and acquiescing to its demands for ever deeper incursions into everyday life, involves much more than the surrender of information: it is to place the entire track of one\u2019s life, the determination of ones path, under the purview and control of the market, just as Pok\u00e9mon Go players are walked, lit by their glowing screens, straight through the doors of shops they didn\u2019t even know they wanted to visit.</p> <p>When this logic of invisible coercion is applied to the social sphere, its implications become even more disturbing. The belief that human behaviour can be perfectly modelled, predicted and controlled entrains as a consequence the collapse of equitable relations between individuals and trust in institutions, and the substitution of algorithmic certainty for any semblance of participatory, democratic society. There is no appeal to collective, contestable decision-making or to responsible business practices under this purported perfection of human behaviour. Surveillance capitalism, run as the code for everyday life, erases both free will and free markets \u2013 an outcome as horrifying to confirmed believers in \u201cgood old\u201d capitalism, such as Zuboff, as to those of us who weren\u2019t so sure about the original in the first place.</p> <p>What is hinted at throughout the text, and made explicit in Zuboff\u2019s closing insistence that subsequent generations must face up to this epochal challenge to the future, is that such utopian schemes are destined to fail. As experience has shown, the world \u2013 life itself \u2013 is cloudy, contingent and defined by change. As horrifying as the surveillance capitalists\u2019 view of a totally controlled, perfectly articulated and error-free future might be, the inevitable failure of its vision, and the resultant violence \u2013 already evident in our fractured worldviews, competing fundamentalisms, weakening of social bonds, and distrust of one another \u2013 is perhaps more so.

Joe Burns reached 180 before playing on but that only brought about another huge partnership, this time featuring Kurtis Patterson and Tim Paine. The former registered his maiden Test century, advancing to 114, while the latter called time on his innings on 45, with his team on 534-5, a declaration that caught everyone by surprise.</p> <p>Sri Lanka\u2019s response was serene for 30 overs with Dimuth Karunaratne and Lahiru Thirimanne batting beautifully, but in the blink of an eye the match altered course. Pat Cummins, bowling short at Karunaratne from around the wicket, struck the Sri Lankan opener on the back of his helmet. There was a long delay in play while the batsman was treated on field. He was taken immediately to hospital where he remains under observation.</p> <p>Soon afterwards Thirimanne perished to a superb Lyon delivery with further wickets falling to Cummins and Mitchell Starc before the close of play. From 82-0 Sri Lanka slid to 123-3, which may well be 123-4 considering Karunaratne\u2019s condition. </p> <p>Tomorrow promises to be a scorcher in Canberra and Australia will be keen to utilise the dry weather and wrap up the Test in advance of forecast rain on Monday. To find out if they succeed join me, Adam and Geoff right here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf77a74f40cd38107867d3514ce3efc2a3029b62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf77a74f40cd38107867d3514ce3efc2a3029b62/0_0_3000_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pat Cummins reasserted Australia\u2019s ascendancy over Sri Lanka late on day two of the second Test in Canberra.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pat Cummins reasserted Australia\u2019s ascendancy over Sri Lanka late on day two of the second Test in Canberra.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saeed Khan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-02T07:16:00.554Z\">at 7.16am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c553d83e4b072f2ace1b713\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-02T06:53:38.383Z\">6.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>42nd over: Sri Lanka 123-3 (K Perera 11, Dananjaya 1) </strong>The final over of the day is a bit of a fizzer.

One of the best grounds, alone for the fact that they still allow kick 2 kick after Canberra (aka Southwestern Western Sydney) Giants AFL games. A hill and the old scoreboard give it a feel that is now unique amongst Test venues since the new Adelaide Oval update.</p> <p>Being a German cricket tragic from my first ever cricket game at the MCG for the 2010/11 Ashes (day 1, don\u2019t think much happened, as far as I remember...) my playing talent is on a level with Scott Morrison\u2019s prime ministership or Tony Abbott\u2019s tenure as Minister for Women. Like them, it never stopped me from trying though, and their results were arguably worse for Australians.</p> <p>In Canberra I decided to try playing and was welcomed by the lovely Woden Wanderers Cricket Club in their fifth grade team, where they even let me bowl slow right arm (non) offspin. Having never held a cricket bat before turning 28, my exploits with the willow were limited to imitations of Jason Gillespie, pre double-century. </p> <p>As fate had it, I got one call up to their highest grade team, I think 3rd grade. By call up, I mean that they had only 10 players and my mate was the selector. In true Grade Cricketer style I fielded (mid on, maybe), didn\u2019t bowl and batted 11. Since we collapsed like England in the Caribbean, I actually had to face their opening bowler on his third spell or so. Stacked cordon and light chatter welcomes me, who had at that stage decided to bat left handed, inspired by reading about Hussey and playing tennis left handed but writing with my right. </p> <p>I just reflectively had picked the wrong gloves and batted right handed despite this, not that it would have mattered. The first ball pitched on middle and off and swung to 4th or 5th stump. This was the first time I had actually ever seen proper swing. First slip encouragingly said \u201che\u2019ll nick one soon, get ready for a catch\u201d. I had \u201cleft\u201d the ball, because I had no clue where it went and my defensive push went nowhere. So I turned around and informed the gentleman that there would be no chance in hell that I would get anywhere near enough to the ball to nick it. The next ball pitched leg and swung to mid where it made a mess of my stumps, highlighting that bowlers are smarter than batsmen. It was at the ground next to the Mint, another iconic Canberra location.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c14021c68838f78a2705155ff6ade8947ee71f24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c14021c68838f78a2705155ff6ade8947ee71f24/0_0_4961_3412/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Jack Fingleton Scoreboard is a feature of the latest Test venue.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Jack Fingleton Scoreboard is a feature of the latest Test venue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c551b68e4b072f2ace1b699\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-02T04:25:30.694Z\">4.25am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A change of OBO driver means a change of contact details. <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JPHowcroft\">@JPHowcroft</a> </strong>to pester me on Twitter, or feed me some nourishing emails at<strong> <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.howcroft.freelance@theguardian.com\">jonathan.howcroft.freelance@theguardian.com</a>. </strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c551ac5e4b0d86c564375d1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-02T04:22:46.050Z\">4.22am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Let\u2019s enjoy the tea interval with a nice tribute to Kurtis, who blowed Sri Lanka away earlier today.

But would having that extra fresh option, especially someone as rapid as Pattinson who bowled remarkably well in England two summers ago for Notts, make a bigger overall contribution?

Burns is gone for his best Test score of 180, and his fourth Test century. Three of them have been over 150. He\u2019s got something, as we\u2019ve all known for a while. Quite why he hasn\u2019t been in the team between now and Johannesburg last year is the enduring mystery. Safe to say he\u2019s back, even as he goes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FoxCricket/status/1091486198105759744\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WICKET: Joe Burns plays one onto his stumps.

It wrapped up yesterday at 308, meaning it was the biggest partnership since Shaun Marsh and Adam Voges towelled up a sorry West Indies team in Hobart back in 2015. That day Voges and Marsh nearly broke the all-time Australian partnership record of 451, Marsh eventually falling with the stand worth 459. </p> <p>So, 2015. You read that and think that it\u2019s been a while. But then if you dig a little deeper on the numbers, there have only been 22 Australian stands worth over 300 in history. Ever. </p> <p>Of those 22, Bradman featured in five of them. Because of course he did. But he also featured in the first, in 1934. The first 60 years of Test cricket didn\u2019t feature a single stand that big. Then there was a gap of 17 years between Bradman\u2019s last and Bill Lawry\u2019s first of two, then 20 more years before the next featuring another Marsh and Mark Taylor.</p> <p>The great Australian Waugh-Ponting era only produced four 300 stands between 1999 and 2006. They don\u2019t come along very often, regardless of the conditions or situation. So while people can qualify that this came against a weak Sri Lankan attack, assembling a score of this magnitude between two batsmen is still a rare achievement. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c54ca9ce4b0d86c56437469\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-01T22:41:06.854Z\">10.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Drop me a line</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As ever, the tweet lines are open via @GeoffLemonSport, and the email channel is crackling as we scroll through the stations to find geoff.lemon@theguardian.com.

So let\u2019s hope people can do the right thing and leave him alone.</p> <p>We\u2019ll get going in just under an hour, on another cool and cloudy day in Canberra.<br></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s the match report: Another day has gone Australia\u2019s way in this one-sided series with Sri Lanka. During the morning and afternoon sessions runs continued to flow as they did on day one. Joe Burns reached 180 before playing on but that only brought about another huge partnership, this time featuring Kurtis Patterson and Tim Paine. The former registered his maiden Test century, advancing to 114, while the latter called time on his innings on 45, with his team on 534-5, a declaration that caught everyone by surprise. Sri Lanka\u2019s response was serene for 30 overs with Dimuth Karunaratne and Lahiru Thirimanne batting beautifully, but in the blink of an eye the match altered course. Pat Cummins, bowling short at Karunaratne from around the wicket, struck the Sri Lankan opener on the back of his helmet. There was a long delay in play while the batsman was treated on field. He was taken immediately to hospital where he remains under observation. Soon afterwards Thirimanne perished to a superb Lyon delivery with further wickets falling to Cummins and Mitchell Starc before the close of play. From 82-0 Sri Lanka slid to 123-3, which may well be 123-4 considering Karunaratne\u2019s condition. Tomorrow promises to be a scorcher in Canberra and Australia will be keen to utilise the dry weather and wrap up the Test in advance of forecast rain on Monday. To find out if they succeed join me, Adam and Geoff right here. 42nd over: Sri Lanka 123-3 (K Perera 11, Dananjaya 1) The final over of the day is a bit of a fizzer. Despite his pace Starc\u2019s radar is askew and Sri Lanka can regroup in the safety of the pavilion. 41st over: Sri Lanka 122-3 (K Perera 11, Dananjaya 0) Lyon is desperately unlucky not to snag a wicket in his final over. From his first delivery he beats Perera all ends up, the ball somehow missing the outside edge and the off bail by millimetres. From the fifth Perera almost gifts him that dismissal with an elaborate leave. Lyon finishes with 1-40 from 16 overs, including the momentum shifting wicket of Thirimanne. 41st over: Sri Lanka 120-3 (K Perera 9, Dananjaya 0) Starc continues around the wicket to the new right-handed batsman and there\u2019s a pep in his step now, mixing up his length but not his line - laser beam straight. Two overs remaining today. Finally some reward for Starc\u2019s pace! From around the wicket he pounded in hard to Chandimal and eventually the Sri Lankan skipper gloved one behind. 40th over: Sri Lanka 120-2 (Chandimal 15, K Perera 9) Lovely game of cat and mouse between Chandimal and Lyon before the Sri Lankan rotates the strike. Perera then latches onto some length very early, cutting Lyon hard in front of point. Update: Karunaratna is now in hospital for assessment. 39th over: Sri Lanka 115-2 (Chandimal 14, K Perera 5) After one ball over the wicket Starc moves around to Chandimal, suggesting there\u2019s a lack of conviction in his strategy despite hitting 150kph consistently. He\u2019s back over to Perera after the Sri Lanka skipper nudges him for a single. A lovely illustration of the dimensions of Australia\u2019s Test venues. 38th over: Sri Lanka 114-2 (Chandimal 13, K Perera 5) Lyon continues his asphyxiation of Perera but after four four dots the batsman fights back, cutting hard for four. He tries to repeat the trick next ball and almost picks out Burns at point but escapes, just. It\u2019s finally time for Robert Wilson\u2019s email, posted many an hour ago. \u201cStarc\u2019s yips feel transitory if painful,\u201d Mr Wilson suggests. \u201cMitchell Johnson used to go wobbly on a fairly regular basis, and always came back. He always came back. Because of faith. And not his. Management (and teammates) kept voting for the bloke so when his radar eventually locked on again, he was giving it to the English not banging them down in the nets in some Swiss sanatorium. I don\u2019t think Starc\u2019s yorker is something you want to leave in the garage\u201d. Agree 100%. He is still in my Ashes attack no question. 37th over: Sri Lanka 110-2 (Chandimal 13, K Perera 1) Mitchell Starc is belatedly recalled into the attack by Tim Paine. It\u2019s worth noting that Cummins did his damage in his second spell after Tea, before Starc had even thrown the ball once. The big lefty gets some serious heat in his opening over but there\u2019s little consistency of line or length. Chandimal latches onto some width to slash a four then plays with soft hands to thick edge another boundary that scuttles along the ground wide of second slip. 36th over: Sri Lanka 102-2 (Chandimal 5, K Perera 1) Lyon now looks unplayable to the left-handed Perera, spinning the ball away from the bat after dropping it temptingly on a length with that prodigious overspin. Maiden over. Seven overs remaining in the day. 35th over: Sri Lanka 102-2 (Chandimal 5, K Perera 1) Pat Cummins is some cricketer. On a pitch doing nothing but offer runs to all-comers his venom disrupts Sri Lanka\u2019s serene progress then his craft produces a wicket. There is no finer sight in cricket that a fast bowler hitting the top of off stump and that is exactly what Pat Cummins has done. Wherever that ball pitched needs a blue plaque because that is the exact line and length all right-arm over the wicket bowlers should be aiming for. Once Cummins\u2019 delivery had landed in the appropriate spot it wobbled a fraction away from the batsman, deceiving him to play inside the line only to hear the fateful rattle of flying bails behind him. 34th over: Sri Lanka 101-1 (Chandimal 5, Mendis 6) Kusal Mendis isn\u2019t hanging around, slog-sweeping his first two balls from Lyon. The first lands between long-on and deep midwicket and runs away for four, the second is mistimed much squarer for a single. Lyon then has a massive appeal for LBW against Chandimal and AUSTRALIA REVIEW. Lyon beat Chandimal in the flight, the ball turning beyond the inside-edge and into the front pad but the decision was declined onfield. What does DRS say? Spinning too hard to beat leg stump. REVIEW LOST. 33rd over: Sri Lanka 94-1 (Chandimal 3, Mendis 1) Cummins over the wicket now to the two new right-handed batsmen. The line is still tight to the body though, allowing both Sri Lankans to nudge their ways off donuts. Thirimanne shows no adverse effects from the retirement of his opening partner, forcefully sweeping Lyon for four then rocking back and cutting for four more behind point. Yep, spoke too soon, Lyon nails his line and length, Thirimanne props forward, the ball clips the shoulder of the bat and Usman Khawaja pouches a simple catch at first slip. Cruising a couple of overs ago, Sri Lanka are now missing both openers. Rotten luck for the visitors. 31st over: Sri Lanka 82-0 (Thirimanne 33, Chandimal 0) Chandimal negotiates the final two deliveries of the over. Big test now for Sri Lanka to regain focus following that nasty incident. Still 12 overs left in the day. The medicab has driven off the field of play towards a waiting ambulance. Dinesh Chandimal is out in the middle and play will resume shortly. That stretcher has now been lifted onto the medicab. Karunaratna, wearing a neck brace, is being strapped securely in position. No short-cuts are being taken out in the middle while Karunaratna is being treated. He has been lifted onto a stretcher with three paramedics overseeing the operation along with a host of Sri Lankan and Australian support staff. It looks very unlikely that Karunaratna will continue batting. Dinesh Chandimal is readying himself by the boundary rope. Paramedics are now out in the middle. The batsman has still not moved from his position flat on his back with his knees in the air. Karunaratna hasn\u2019t moved since he hit the deck but he is talking to the army of medicos assisting him. The medicab has driven out to the middle in case of emergency. 30.4 over: Sri Lanka 82-0 (D Karunaratne 46, Thirimanne 33) Karunaratna\u2019s turn to receive treatment and this looks considerably more serious. Cummins dropped one short from around the wicket to the left-hander and the batsman had no idea what he was doing, making a late decision to duck into the bouncer, the ball flicking his front shoulder and scudding into the back of his helmet. Karunaratna immediately dropped to the turf with assistance arriving from all angles. There will be a lengthy break in play. 30th over: Sri Lanka 82-0 (D Karunaratne 46, Thirimanne 33) A rare false stroke against Lyon sees Thirimanne get a lot of top-edge on a slog sweep. Fortunately for him there\u2019s enough wood on the shot to see the ball clear the infield. Russell Jackson, formerly of this parish, wrote the magnum opus on curved run-ups here. It includes nominations for Merv Hughes and the incomparable Malcolm Marshall. 29th over: Sri Lanka 80-0 (D Karunaratne 46, Thirimanne 31) Cummins replaces Richardson but continues the same approach - around the wicket, hitting the deck hard. Again the line is a tad too much towards the pads and Sri Lanka profit without much trouble. This has been a textbook day for over-rates. 30 overs were due in this final session and at the midpoint we\u2019ve seen 15 of them. We remain on track for a 5,30pm finish. 28th over: Sri Lanka 77-0 (D Karunaratne 45, Thirimanne 29) After the excitement of the previous over a return to normality with Sri Lanka safely negotiating Lyon before enjoying a well-earned drink. Some better vision of Price\u2019s curved run-up here, from the 1964 Ashes Test at old Trafford. Very Daniel Worrall areas. 27th over: Sri Lanka 76-0 (D Karunaratne 45, Thirimanne 29) Ooooh, after batting serenly since Tea, Thirimanne is in a spot of bother. Richardson\u2019s line from around the wicket has finally paid dividends, getting one to lift, chase the left-hander, and smack into his top hand. Out comes the physio and the magic spray. When play resumes Thirimanne gets off strike but there\u2019s more action to follow with Karunaratna top-edging an ambitious pull to a 147kph lifter that is fortunate to fly over the cordon for four. \u201cGood morning Jonathan,\u201d good evening Steve Ditchburn, \u201cI would nominate John Price in the \u2018Angled Run Up Stakes\u2019. A friend once faced him playing against Middlesex 2nds - Mr Price had been injured and was making his way back slowly. My friend said he saw the run up but not the ball as it whizzed past his outside edge. Best played from the other end. Currently in Cape Town, yesterday I watched SA v Pakistan 1st T20, a great spectacle\u201d. 26th over: Sri Lanka 70-0 (D Karunaratne 40, Thirimanne 28) Another over of skittish calling, the only facet of batting Sri Lanka look vulnerable in right now. Lyon is once again seen off with no alarms and no surprises. 25th over: Sri Lanka 69-0 (D Karunaratne 39, Thirimanne 28) Some creativity from Australia here with Richardson moving around the wicket and Paine responding with a field full of catchers in front of the bat, including two shortish midwickets. The bowler\u2019s line is a touch too legside to trouble either left-hander though. Some questionable calling excites Australia\u2019s ring fielders on a couple of occasions but a catastrophic run out was never really on the cards. 24th over: Sri Lanka 68-0 (D Karunaratne 39, Thirimanne 28) Better from Lyon, drawing Thirimanne forward more frequently this over. A maiden is his reward. 23rd over: Sri Lanka 68-0 (D Karunaratne 39, Thirimanne 28) Another composed run-scoring over from Sri Lanka. This pair are causing Australia a few headaches with their calm accumulation. 22nd over: Sri Lanka 66-0 (D Karunaratne 37, Thirimanne 28) Since that early run of maidens after Tea Sri Lanka have done extremely well to rotate the strike and deny Australia the opportunity to apply some pressure. Lyon in particular has been on the wrong end of some well-judged singles. 21st over: Sri Lanka 63-0 (D Karunaratne 35, Thirimanne 27) Richardson replaces Cummins from the pool end, which gives me a chance to celebrate his marvellously angled run-up. You don\u2019t see many of those any more. Who had the best? Can I nominate Angus Fraser? Meanwhile, back at the cricket, Thirimanne whip-cracks a half-volley outside his off stump for a beautiful four that leaves scorch marks on the Manuka Oval turf on its way to the cover fence. Sri Lanka look like they\u2019re enjoying themselves out there. 20th over: Sri Lanka 58-0 (D Karunaratne 34, Thirimanne 23) Nice intent from Sri Lanka, unsettling Lyon with a well-run two from the opening ball of the over then scampering singles from deliveries two and four. Lyon almost exacts his revenge but a push to short-leg arrives in Labuschagne\u2019s hands on the half-volley. 19th over: Sri Lanka 54-0 (D Karunaratne 33, Thirimanne 20) Cummins moves back over the wicket after spending the start of his spell around to the left-handers. He\u2019s immediately on a tight line across Thirimanne, maintaining that deck-hitting length, pinning the batsman to the crease and slipping in the occasional bouncer. Can he execute the fuller one and draw the false stroke? Not this over, which ends with a nudged single into the onside. I\u2019ve just checked the radar and there are a few slow-moving showers heading our way. It would not surprise me if there was a brief interruption between now and the close. 18th over: Sri Lanka 53-0 (D Karunaratne 33, Thirimanne 19) Lyon finally lands one in exactly the right place and Thirimanne is left groping at fresh air while the ball spins beyond his outside edge. Again, around that jaffa, length is an issue and Sri Lanka pinch a couple of singles. \u201cAs I stroke my imaginary beard (with some sticky tape left in the middle after Sunday cricket), I wonder about the inability of the Aussies to generate definitive reverse swing ever since the South Africa tour,\u201d begins OB Jato, in an email that seems unlikely to upset anybody. \u201cOn the same flat pitches, with decent servings of sugar still in the dressing room, are the bowlers properly *applying* themselves? During the Ashes, they were Swinging It Like Botham, but that ability seems to have vanished in thin air along with Bancroft, Smith and Warner. I know it\u2019s a controversial topic since the rest of the \u2018leadership group\u2019 had nothing to do with the tampering, but is there any theory which arises in your mind that the Tail-Ender Starc may have lost some of his threat, and thus lost the plot with his confidence, line, and length, ever since the Aussies have not been \u2018shining\u2019 the ball like they used to?\u201d 17th over: Sri Lanka 51-0 (D Karunaratne 32, Thirimanne 18) A run! A run! Huzzah! Just the one, no need to get carried away, but the Jack Fingleton Scoreboard gets a workout for the first time since Tea. Or maybe we can get carried away? Karunaratne pierces the ring for a couple then dabs and runs for another single. 16th over: Sri Lanka 47-0 (D Karunaratne 29, Thirimanne 17) Another maiden. We\u2019re now up to 21 dots, either side of Tea. It\u2019s not the most testing of overs from Lyon though whose length is a little on the short side, but Karunaratna is unable to put him away through the well-placed offside field. 15th over: Sri Lanka 47-0 (D Karunaratne 29, Thirimanne 17) Cummins partners Lyon after the interval and he makes it 12 dots in a row since Tea. The paceman is opting for the deck-hitting approach to Thirimanne but he\u2019s not getting much reward from the flat track. A quick shout out to Trent Copeland, who has been a superb addition to Australian screens this summer. He\u2019s grown into his role as the analyst (TM), looking at home with the technology, unafraid to draw on a variety of data, and adding genuine insight from a player\u2019s perspective, which remains all-too rare, despite commentary boxes of all sports being almost exclusively staffed by former pros. 14th over: Sri Lanka 47-0 (D Karunaratne 29, Thirimanne 17) Plenty of turn and bounce again for Lyon. Karunaratna is happy to play out a maiden, largely defensively but he looks for runs from the final ball but can\u2019t capitalise on Lyon dropping short. This will be a testing session from the GOAT. Play will resume shortly. A neat 30 overs remain in the day, textbook stuff for a change. I\u2019m surprised there wasn\u2019t more chat on the OBO about the possibility of rain today and later in this Test. According to my forecast there\u2019s been around a 65% chance of showers since about 3pm and more rain is expected on Monday especially. I\u2019m sure that was a consideration in Tim Paine\u2019s declaration. Fortunately it is sunny and glorious at Manuka Oval right now as Nathan Lyon prepares to bowl his second over... Thilo emailed this to Adam, but Adam is a kind and thoughtful man and didn\u2019t want it to go to waste. \u201cAs a fellow Canbassador I\u2019m absolutely livid that my early departure (lbw Dutton P) from the best small capital stops me from attending this monumental historic event that is the first ACT Test. One of the best grounds, alone for the fact that they still allow kick 2 kick after Canberra (aka Southwestern Western Sydney) Giants AFL games. A hill and the old scoreboard give it a feel that is now unique amongst Test venues since the new Adelaide Oval update. Being a German cricket tragic from my first ever cricket game at the MCG for the 2010/11 Ashes (day 1, don\u2019t think much happened, as far as I remember...) my playing talent is on a level with Scott Morrison\u2019s prime ministership or Tony Abbott\u2019s tenure as Minister for Women. Like them, it never stopped me from trying though, and their results were arguably worse for Australians. In Canberra I decided to try playing and was welcomed by the lovely Woden Wanderers Cricket Club in their fifth grade team, where they even let me bowl slow right arm (non) offspin. Having never held a cricket bat before turning 28, my exploits with the willow were limited to imitations of Jason Gillespie, pre double-century. As fate had it, I got one call up to their highest grade team, I think 3rd grade. By call up, I mean that they had only 10 players and my mate was the selector. In true Grade Cricketer style I fielded (mid on, maybe), didn\u2019t bowl and batted 11. Since we collapsed like England in the Caribbean, I actually had to face their opening bowler on his third spell or so. Stacked cordon and light chatter welcomes me, who had at that stage decided to bat left handed, inspired by reading about Hussey and playing tennis left handed but writing with my right. I just reflectively had picked the wrong gloves and batted right handed despite this, not that it would have mattered. The first ball pitched on middle and off and swung to 4th or 5th stump. This was the first time I had actually ever seen proper swing. First slip encouragingly said \u201che\u2019ll nick one soon, get ready for a catch\u201d. I had \u201cleft\u201d the ball, because I had no clue where it went and my defensive push went nowhere. So I turned around and informed the gentleman that there would be no chance in hell that I would get anywhere near enough to the ball to nick it. The next ball pitched leg and swung to mid where it made a mess of my stumps, highlighting that bowlers are smarter than batsmen. It was at the ground next to the Mint, another iconic Canberra location.\u201d A change of OBO driver means a change of contact details. @JPHowcroft to pester me on Twitter, or feed me some nourishing emails at jonathan.howcroft.freelance@theguardian.com. Let\u2019s enjoy the tea interval with a nice tribute to Kurtis, who blowed Sri Lanka away earlier today. He got the break early, when he was dropped at short-leg first ball. Coming up next on Mid-morning Matters... Thank you very much Mr Collins, my favourite cricketing Adam since Adam Hollioake. Surprisingly (to me anyway) Hollioake was the first Adam to play Test cricket for England. 586 men appeared for England before an Adam finally rocked up in 1997. There\u2019s only ever been two English Test Adams, it turns out. Adam Lyth joining the club in 2015. 13th over: Sri Lanka 47-0 (D Karunaratne 29, Thirimanne 17) Cummins sends down the final set before the tea break, but that doesn\u2019t bother Thirimanne who lifts a shorter ball over the slips and down to the third man boundary! Earlier in the set, Karunaratne was at it too, pushing off he back foot through extra cover for three. That\u2019s a nice, positive way to finish off what has been a very good hour for the tourists after Australia declared their first innings closed at 534-5. But the Australian openers then struggled to do much with the new ball, Starc volatile and Richardson docile. Both sides have a bit of work to do after the breather. For that, stick with JP Howcroft on the 1s and 2s through to the close. Bye for now! 12th over: Sri Lanka 40-0 (D Karunaratne 25, Thirimanne 13) It is all action with Lyon from the get go, beating Thirimanne with one that turns as much as the first ball he bowled in Test cricket at Kumar Sangakkara way back when. Wonderful bowling to begin on the ground that Lyon calls home. Later in the set, he draws a false stroke from him that nearly makes it to the hands of the man at backward point! Lyon sure loves bowling at Manuka, his true home ground. 11th over: Sri Lanka 38-0 (D Karunaratne 25, Thirimanne 12) Cummins is getting a nice degree of shape into Thirimanne from round the wicket, making any leave dicey from that angle. Good cricket from both. He keeps the strike with a tuck around the corner. Time for Nathan Lyon? Yep. He\u2019s ready to come on. \u201cWith regards to the Richies (and they really should shuffle off),\u201d begins Phil Withall, \u201cat every test I\u2019ve been to in Australia there are large groups of people that appear to be paying tribute to David Boon. They normally start mid-afternoon and make a valiant effort to recreate \u2018that\u2019 flight to England.\u201d Drinking in Australia at the cricket is a thing - no doubt at all - but in my experience, English crowds are world-leaders at getting full in the outer. 10th over: Sri Lanka 37-0 (D Karunaratne 25, Thirimanne 11) Richardson follows Cummins by redirecting to round the wicket, this way forcing them to play. But having watched Karunaratne\u2019s straight drive in the previous over, Thirimanne is doing much the same time this around, albeit for three. Richardson busts out his bumper in response, as is the custom, for the first time in this spell. 9th over: Sri Lanka 34-0 (D Karunaratne 25, Thirimanne 8) Oh my, that\u2019s a wooooonderful shot from Karunaratne to cap the first Cummins over of the afternoon, lashing a picture-perfect on-drive past the umpire and down to the rope. Until that point, Cummins was played respectfully, the first change not sending down any deliveries that could be left alone or ignored. \u201cThere is rain forecast on Monday, and with the pitch as flat as Britain\u2019s policy-making progress, I understand their decision, even if I don\u2019t agree with it,\u201d emails Abhijato Sensarma. Of course, he\u2019s right. I have a thing about early declarations. He continues: \u201cAnyways, this declaration is momentous not only because it\u2019s Paine\u2019s first, but because I can\u2019t remember a single skipper in recent history who has declared so close to a milestone, one which he seldom gets too! He\u2019s a fantastic bloke - well-behaved, experienced enough to know all the ups and downs of a sporting career, the wittiest sledger in the game, and a man with underappreciated Test tactics. While he may not be the ideal player, he is Dhoni-eque - he adds value beyond the runs and catches. I saw his only international century; he was a terrific batsman once. Even now he\u2019s stoic enough, and one of the best keepers in the world. When Smith returns and completes his leadership ban, I want Paine to lead the side as long as he\u2019s able to stand on two legs. Tim\u2019s terrific, ain\u2019t he?\u201d 8th over: Sri Lanka 30-0 (D Karunaratne 21, Thirimanne 8) Here come the runs off Richardson, three impotent maidens followed by an over worth seven, Karunaratne pushing two through cover then turning the strike over to midwicket. Thirimanne, who watched a lot of balls on the 6th-10th stump line from him so far, also gets stuck into one this time, crushing him through extra cover to get his first boundary and a lovely one at that. 7th over: Sri Lanka 23-0 (D Karunaratne 18, Thirimanne 4) After a solid previous over, Starc begins his fourth with another ball that drifts onto the pads of Karunaratne, the experienced opener making no mistake putting it away for his third boundary. But he improves as the set continues, slipping past the inside edge of Karunaratne - prompting an appeal for lbw - then going beyond his outside edge to finish with the opener pushing when he should have been leaving. \u201cAm I alone in thinking that the Richies should have been a one hit wonder?\u201d asks Phillip Lewis. \u201cI guess it was a solid enough gag in the beginning but even the best gags wear thin with excessive repetition. What year was it when they started? They\u2019d best get creative again and come up with a new routine for next summer. The Chappelli\u2019s, circa 1972, perhaps?\u201d I\u2019ll put that to Ian, he\u2019s sitting a couple of seats down writing his column - ever the pro, no ghost writer in sight. 6th over: Sri Lanka 18-0 (D Karunaratne 13, Thirimanne 4) Once again it takes four balls from Richardson though to the wicketkeeper before Thirimanne needs to play. Watching from our vantage point right behind the bowler, there just isn\u2019t any swing on offer for him back to the left handers, and they\u2019re leaving him well. 5th over: Sri Lanka 18-0 (D Karunaratne 13, Thirimanne 4) Phew. A maiden from Starc, Karunaratne having to leave closer to his off stump, defend and get out the way of a decent short one. Something to build on. Interesting the contrast between the TV calls that has been opening up over the last couple of Tests - not least since Isa Guha finished up for the summer. But there\u2019s an audience big enough to cater for all different types of commentary, so the good news these days is that if you aren\u2019t into Love Island and lasagne, the alternative is there. Nothing wrong with that, by the way: follow your heart. 4th over: Sri Lanka 18-0 (D Karunaratne 13, Thirimanne 4) Richardson is off the mark too, allowing Thirimanne to leave all six of these deliveries. Cue the calls for Cummins to get the new ball. Yes, I\u2019m being a bit cheeky. But twitter is twitter. 3rd over: Sri Lanka 18-0 (D Karunaratne 13, Thirimanne 4) This is just... ropey. No other word for it. During the Fox Cricket ad breaks, they have been showing some of his World Cup 2015 highlights to fire people up for the tournament in June/July this year. Right now, this is not the same guy. Yes, he\u2019s quick. Yes, the accurate bumper is still part of the over and he\u2019s over 150kph. But soon enough he\u2019s on the pads, and by the end short and wide, Karunaratne safe to throw his hands with a cut over the cordon. 2nd over: Sri Lanka 11-0 (D Karunaratne 8, Thirimanne 3) We were side on for Richardson\u2019s debut on the OBO last week, so we didn\u2019t get a full appreciation of just how wide he runs in - what a beautiful throwback it is. It\u2019s not a great first over here, mind, the young quick allowing Karunaratne to watch four deliveries pass through well wide of the off-stump before defending the last couple. 1st over: Sri Lanka 11-0 (D Karunaratne 8, Thirimanne 3) Four first ball! Nice clip from Karunaratne to get his afternoon underway, then taking one in the same direction. A quicker, full delivery nearly gets through Thirimanne first ball, hitting him on the pad, but going down the legside. He\u2019s off the mark next ball, again with a clip from a ball on leg stump, denied a four only due to an athletic dive from Jhye Richardson (of course) on the boundary. Starc hits 154kph on the radar with his penultimate ball, locating Karunaratne\u2019s inside edge. Completing the quick but inaccurate set there\u2019s another tuck forward of square by Karunaratne, this time the extra run saved by Cummins on the rope with a dive just as impressive as Richardson\u2019s. 11 from the Starc over and I don\u2019t know what to make of it. The players are back on the field! This is a big spell for Starc. He\u2019ll be running in at Karunaratne to begin. GO! Isn\u2019t that a bit of a waste? I understand wanting to win in four days and so on. But Tim Paine hasn\u2019t made a first class ton since 2006 and Kurtis Patterson was re-setting beautifully after reaching his century. Isn\u2019t there a skill in going on to tally 600-plus and a great news story in Paine that\u2019s gone begging? Not to be. A wonderful round of applause from the Canberra crowd for Kurtis Patterson, completing his first Test century with red ink. Unless something completely out of the ordinary occurs over the next two days, he\u2019ll go to England with a Test average of 144. Cop that, Bradman. 132nd over: Australia 534-5 (Patterson 114, Paine 45) Oh right, they\u2019ve had enough? Paine has pulled the pin five runs short of his half-century. We didn\u2019t even have enough time for the declaration speculation, coming at least an hour or two earlier than the norm. Anyway, they\u2019ve had their fill and that\u2019s it. It is Paine\u2019s first ever declaration as captain, for what little that factoid is worth. 131st over: Australia 531-5 (Patterson 111, Paine 45) Shoooot! Patterson\u2019s square is to die for, latching onto the third ball of Rajith\u2019s new spell, crunching it off the front foot through point for four. In keeping with the theme of this hour of play, three more singles are found to the deep. 130th over: Australia 524-5 (Patterson 105, Paine 44) Paine dances and drives to the long-on sweeper to start the new Perera over. Good intent from Patterson to grab a single to mid-off, taking on the fielder and making it easily. Paine then inches closer to a milestone of his own, deflecting a couple behind point. 129th over: Australia 519-5 (Patterson 103, Paine 41) Poor Karunaratne has really fallen away since his first over yesterday. Then, he picked up Labuschagne with the fifth offering of his international career. Now, he has 1/146 from 24 overs. The Australian pair are doing as they please against him here, picking up four singles, three of those from impotent deliveries on the line of the body. 128th over: Australia 515-5 (Patterson 101, Paine 39) Patterson starts again, solid in defence after reaching three figures. Always a good sign. Singles to the sweepers for both men complete the Perera over. The next question: can Tim Paine join Head and Patterson by making his own maiden century here? 127th over: Australia 513-5 (Patterson 100, Paine 38) And brought up in style with a well-timed push through cover off Karunaratne, the pair turning easily for three! The footage of his family in the stands is quite brilliant, so proud of the 25-year-old for the way he has made this opportunity count. Two weeks ago he wasn\u2019t so much as in the Test squad, now he\u2019s just about a lock for the Ashes. Well batted, young man. 126th over: Australia 505-5 (Patterson 97, Paine 35) Ooooh! I like this, the senior spinner Perera back and he\u2019s not letting Patterson walk to 100 on his watch. The left-hander did jump down the track a couple of times, the second of those prompting a false shot and nearly making it to cover in the air. But he\u2019s all good. 125th over: Australia 505-5 (Patterson 97, Paine 35) For the first time since the SCG Test last year, the Australians have made it to 500 in an innings! They reach the milestone through a pair of Patterson boundaries, taking him to within three of a ton. Karunaratne, the man on debut, is short with his first ball, pulled away with ease, then a fraction wide later in the set, hammered away behind point. Easy! 124th over: Australia 496-5 (Patterson 88, Paine 35) Easy pickings for Patterson, leaning into a half-volley from Fernando, threading it through the gap for four. He had the chance to move into the 90s with four more but missed out, his pull shot finding midwicket. In any case, we\u2019re not far away from a very special moment for the young man here. 123rd over: Australia 490-5 (Patterson 83, Paine 34) Long on, deep point, deep backward square. There are singles on offer all over the place and both batsmen, well set by any measure, are happy to take advantage with no risk whatsoever. It being day two, The Richies are in doing their usual thing, sitting at the far end of the ground. But beneath my position at long-on the Sri Lankan fans are drowning them out with their own trumpets, drums and tunes. Far preferable. 122nd over: Australia 487-5 (Patterson 82, Paine 32) Fernando keeps with his short attack to begin but his bumper sails over Patterson\u2019s head, called a wide. He brings it down a couple of feet above the left-hander\u2019s hip with enough time to pull it around the corner for a couple. The left-armer aborts the plan and starts mixing it up on a full length but is unable to get through the Patterson defence. \u201cLoving the blog,\u201d emails my old mate Sam Casey. \u201cOn the Manuka/NZ chat [that was on the OBO yesterday] State Circle, which girts Parliament House, has avenues running off it for the capital of each state of Australia. Canberra Avenue, on which you find the oval, was intended to be named Wellington Avenue because there was still some thought that New Zealand may become a state of Australia (section 124 of the Constitution still allows for this).\u201d 121st over: Australia 484-5 (Patterson 80, Paine 32) Shot! Patterson uses his feet for the first time in the session and lashes Dhananjaya on the up down the ground for four to move him into the 80s. He\u2019s back in the groove here after lunch. 120th over: Australia 479-5 (Patterson 75, Paine 32) Fernando shifts to round the wicket at Paine, the captain taking on the short ball when he arrives, down well in front of the two men on the rope hoping for a top edge. He defends the rest. Some lovely shots of the Jack Fingleton Scoreboard so far (one of those I\u2019m fairly happy with from my own lens yesterday when Burns brought up his ton), but I love this as well from when the hand-operated beaut lived at the MCG. So many of the defining memories from the pre-colour colour action at \u2018G included television vision taken of it at the conclusion of VFL Grand Finals and so on, not to mention the 1956 Olympics. 119th over: Australia 477-5 (Patterson 75, Paine 30) At lunch, Jim Maxwell said that he has rarely seen a less threatening spin duo than Perera and Dhananjaya in this innings so far, the latter milked for three ODI-esque singles to begin this middle stanza. The players are back on the field. Dhananjaya has the ball from the southern end bowling at Paine (28) with Patterson (74) up the other end, Australia resuming on 474-5. PLAY! An idea. Let\u2019s start with an assumption: England nor Australia will be making a stack of runs this year in the Ashes. Notwithstanding this dig against the second-string Sri Lankans... Tim Paine\u2019s inexperienced side against the moving ball? Joe Root\u2019s against the Australians? Don\u2019t buy a day five ticket is all I\u2019m saying. Anyway, to my selection thought. Australia could accept from the outset that runs will be a struggle and go all-out trying to take 20 England wickets as quickly as possible with the most potent attack possible. Stick with me, I\u2019ll get to my point. What do Tim Paine, James Pattinson and Pat Cummins share in common? Wonderful jawlines, for one. But also, they are Test No7s. But if they batted in order at 6, 7 then 8, would that not be okay as it averages 7? With Paine, Pattinson then Cummins, it gives Australia the ability to play both four quicks and Lyon. Sure, a conventional number six will mean more runs overall. But would having that extra fresh option, especially someone as rapid as Pattinson who bowled remarkably well in England two summers ago for Notts, make a bigger overall contribution? I appreciate this is a bit funky, but surely they are going to have to be in order to win in England for the first time since 2001. Thoughts? Good afternoon! I\u2019ve just returned from a lap of the ground where I saw just about every human that I know from Canberra. It\u2019s a wonderful occasion out there. Of course, with the schedule through to 2023 as it is, the chances of another before then are fairly slim, but they\u2019re making it count out there right now. They\u2019re enjoying Australia in cruise control with the bat, something we haven\u2019t been able to say that often over the last 12 months. At all, come to think of it. A couple of those Patterson square drives were pristine before the interval. He\u2019s surely on the way to maiden Test ton at the second time of asking in this session. So let\u2019s see the new man through to three figures together in the usual way by slinging an email into my inbox or dropping a hot take at my twitter mentions. A better bowling performance from Sri Lanka this morning: more consistent, more accurate. But only one wicket has fallen, and the runs have still flowed fast enough, with 90 runs on the board. Patterson can have some early thoughts of a Test century, if he dares, while Paine also has a great chance for a decent score after the break. There\u2019s a huge amount of time left in the game, there\u2019s a sell-out crowd filling Manuka, it\u2019s a gentle cool and cloudy day, and so there\u2019s no reason for Australia to do anything but bat and bat and bat. That\u2019s it from me \u2013 I\u2019ll be back tomorrow, and coming up next will be Adam Collins. Kindly address your correspondence accordingly. 118th over: Australia 474-5 (Patterson 74, Paine 28) Rajitha to Paine, who works a single. Patterson waits out the rest, including another no-ball. \u201cWas Kurtis Patterson the player who came out to field for New South Wales with a toasted sandwich in his pocket?\u201d asks Brett Sprigg on ABC Grandstand. \u201cIt\u2019s strange what stays in your memory.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d responds Dirk Nannes. \u201cYou can have whatever you like in your pockets.\u201d There is a long silence. \u201cThat might not be the best suggestion,\u201d says Sprigg eventually. \u201cAfter the last ten months or so.\u201d For the record, let it show that the toastie belonged to Nic Maddinson. And appropriately, it\u2019s time for lunch. 117th over: Australia 472-5 (Patterson 74, Paine 27) Gorgeous. Threads the gap between cover and mid-off, as Kusal Perera dives and can\u2019t save. Dilruwan Perera the bowler. Most of Patterson\u2019s boundaries have come from the short ball, and that was easily his best from a fuller pitch. Is he thinking about a hundred yet? 116th over: Australia 468-5 (Patterson 70, Paine 27) Rajitha is back, he\u2019s been Sri Lanka\u2019s best today by a mile. And he nearly bags Patterson straight up. Leading edge that drops short of midwicket. Minor victory for the bowler. But Patterson takes back the ascendancy by smashing a pull shot for four, just beating midwicket who dives, but the ball flies away to the rope. Just as I suspected. 115th over: Australia 463-5 (Patterson 65, Paine 27) The race through the overs continues, de Silva getting through his in about a minute. Patterson\u2019s single through cover at the midpoint is the only score. 114th over: Australia 462-5 (Patterson 64, Paine 27) A maiden from Perera, with Paine happy to stay at home and play conventional defence throughout the set. 113th over: Australia 462-5 (Patterson 64, Paine 27) Paine gets a leg bye, after which Patterson charges de Silva and plonks him through cover for four. I\u2019m not sure if that was supposed to be a high loft or along the ground, but he mis-hit it and split the difference, at a catchable height but in the gap. The partnership is worth 58. 112th over: Australia 457-5 (Patterson 60, Paine 27) Paine getting very cautious, including just padding a Perera delivery away. Old school. Gets a single to close the over. Phillip Lewis emails in: \u201cWhilst reading Steve Smith\u2019s Men I\u2019m reminded of a question I was asking myself in the immediate aftermath of the ball tampering fiasco. Who tipped off the South African TV people? Was it an eagle-eyed doorman? Were the change rooms bugged? How, in short, did anyone other than the suspended culprits know?\u201d I suppose then I have to mention that Phillip is referring to my recent book, available in good bookshops and online. And to answer his question, the South African players had a pretty fair suspicion that there was something unorthodox going on. The broadcasters did the investigative work. 111th over: Australia 456-5 (Patterson 60, Paine 26) Double spin, perhaps, as Dhananjaya de Silva comes on from the Church End. He bowls serviceable part-time off-spin. Patterson cuts a couple and drops a single. Paine gives the strike back thanks to a fumble at mid on. 110th over: Australia 452-5 (Patterson 57, Paine 25) Patterson with the hit-and-run to mid off once more, taking the quick singles well. That\u2019s the only score from the over. 109th over: Australia 451-5 (Patterson 56, Paine 25) Karunaratne lobs the ball from hand to hand, like a clubbie pretending he\u2019s about to come in and bowl a ripping leg-break before sending down a slow doorknob. When he bowls too full, Paine produces the best shot of his innings. The square drive looked risky, but this on-drive is perfect. A picture. Put it on a postcard. The 450 comes up. 108th over: Australia 447-5 (Patterson 56, Paine 21) Paine drives Perera to mid on a couple of times before taking on the man for a single. The only score from the over, but Perera is four runs away from his bowling ton. 107th over: Australia 446-5 (Patterson 56, Paine 20) Karunaratne, from the Church End now although he bowled at the Pool End earlier. Paine tries to repeat the slashing square drive from earlier but this ball doesn\u2019t get up enough, and it creeps under his stroke. When the bowler goes back of a length, Paine is able to force square off the back foot and pick up three out to deep cover. Patterson drives a couple through mid on from a very overpitched delivery. So Karunaratne follows up with one just as full but wider, and Patterson drives it cleanly through point for four. A productive over, worth nine. 106th over: Australia 437-5 (Patterson 50, Paine 17) Now it\u2019s Patterson\u2019s turn to find the field, as Perera keeps dropping short but isn\u2019t punished. Hasn\u2019t bowled with much rhythm. \u201cOne maiden in his spell, that says it all for me,\u201d observes fellow off-spinner Phil Tufnell on ABC radio. Make that two maidens now, but the second wasn\u2019t a quality one. 105th over: Australia 437-5 (Patterson 50, Paine 17) Chamika Karunaratne comes into the attack for Fernando. Patterson glances a single for his milestone, and celebrates in very understated fashion. Paine plays plenty of shots to the next five balls, but finds the field every time. 104th over: Australia 436-5 (Patterson 49, Paine 17) Behind the pace here as the Canberra internet and phone networks combine to black out the blog \u2013 apologies. Dilrurwan bowls a mostly pretty good over, but Patterson produces a quality on-drive away through midwicket for three, which is saved at the rope. 103rd over: Australia 433-5 (Patterson 46, Paine 17) Fernando to Paine, who drops a single away to the leg side and scurries through. Patterson goes more firmly in the same direction for another. This gives you a sense of the Patterson approach. 102nd over: Australia 431-5 (Patterson 45, Paine 16) We\u2019ve had a drinks break and now Dilruwan Perera resumes from the Pool End. A tidy sort of over, met by some tidy defence from Patterson. Some variety from the batsman, happy to use his long reach and also to use his feet to defend. 101st over: Australia 431-5 (Patterson 45, Paine 16) Patterson is a long and bendy batsman, and his gangles are all on display as he pulls a single from Vishwa Fernando. Paine likewise pulls and scores a couple of runs. \u201cDo you think Paine will eye a ton here,\u201d asks Ruth Purdue on email. He can eye one, just like I can eye an Aston Martin through the showroom window. But he hasn\u2019t made a first-class ton since 2006, so the likelihood doesn\u2019t seem high. Certainly hope he can do it before his second-chance career is over. 100th over: Australia 428-5 (Patterson 44, Paine 14) Dilruwan Perera comes on to try some off-breaks, bowling from the Swimming Pool End rather than the Church End where he was yesterday. Paine tries to shovel a couple across his stumps before he gets a single away. Patterson drives to mid-on and sets off with the shot, bolting through as the stumps get thrown down. He was in comfortably but the umpire goes upstairs anyway. Not out: his foot was well in, let alone his bat. 99th over: Australia 426-5 (Patterson 43, Paine 13) Fernando to Paine, left-arm over the wicket, and Paine drives beautifully down the ground for four! Just inside the mid-off fieldsman, who is set quite wide, and it beat his dive. Paine usually likes to get on with the game, though he has played some long innings for Australia since coming back into the side nearly 18 months ago. Picks up another brace through the gully. Then a leg bye. 98th over: Australia 419-5 (Patterson 43, Paine 7) Karunaratne to Patterson bowls most of a good over, angling across the lefty just outside the off stump. But when he tries the bouncer Patterson is more than equal to it, pulling behind square and beating the squarer sweeper into the fence. It\u2019s a no-ball too, yet another overstep for the Sri Lankan attack. 97th over: Australia 414-5 (Patterson 39, Paine 7) That\u2019s a bit more convincing from Paine. Fuller and wide from Rajitha and Paine throws a square drive at it. Nails it for four. Rajitha gets a ball to come into the pads and nearly squeaks through, but Paine gets bat there. Then a tester back of a length that got enough bat that it didn\u2019t constitute an outside edge. But we\u2019ve seen some decent stuff from Rajitha this morning. 96th over: Australia 410-5 (Patterson 39, Paine 3) Karunaratne \u2013 the bowler, not the batsman \u2013 comes on. Short and stocky but wheels the ball down alright. Tim Paine won\u2019t get many better chances than this to make some runs. But he nearly spurns that with a wild cut shot that misses but nearly gives up a top edge. He gets going with a push down the ground for three runs. 95th over: Australia 407-5 (Patterson 39, Paine 0) Rajitha nearly gets another with the chop-on. Patterson stands up tall and gets a bottom edge trying to force away away to the off side. The ball lands kindly for him. Gets a couple of runs on the leg glance. 94th over: Australia 405-5 (Patterson 37, Paine 0) Patterson is unflustered, and keeps collecting singles. Paine tries to block out Fernando\u2019s over, though he misses one and is reprieved by the umpire. Outside leg stump perhaps from the left-armer? 93rd over: Australia 404-5 (Patterson 36, Paine 0) Well, it\u2019s a busy old over from Rajitha. He gets belted by Patterson\u2019s pull shot for four, from a no-ball, and then gives Burns another boundary off the legs. Australia\u2019s 400 comes up. But then Rajitha gets some fortune his way with the wicket. On balance, he\u2019s bowled a few great deliveries and probably deserved some luck. Here comes Paine, blocking out his first ball. Oh, that\u2019s bad luck! But Burns has had plenty of good luck in this knock to this point. Burns is out to the pleave: he half played at this ball well outside off, then wanted to bail out. Left the bat hanging out, the ball comes off the face and bounces down onto his stump. Burns is gone for his best Test score of 180, and his fourth Test century. Three of them have been over 150. He\u2019s got something, as we\u2019ve all known for a while. Quite why he hasn\u2019t been in the team between now and Johannesburg last year is the enduring mystery. Safe to say he\u2019s back, even as he goes. 92nd over: Australia 394-4 (Burns 176, Patterson 31) Burns gets going with his first Queensland shot of the morning, getting up tall for a meaty cut through the covers. Only gets two as the outfield is a touch slow and he didn\u2019t time it perfectly. Fernando follows up by beating his edge with a good one. There\u2019s been something for the bowlers in this early passage, but as we saw yesterday, if you don\u2019t make the most of that you can be in some serious toil. 91st over: Australia 392-4 (Burns 174, Patterson 31) Burns nudges another single, creeping towards that double-century. Patterson edges Rajitha, the second stroke of bad luck for the bowler, as it angles down past gully on the bounce, false shot from an uncontrolled poke. Patterson has a new highest score, following his 30 on debut in Brisbane. If he can keep this trend up in each innings he\u2019ll have a fair record by his 100th Test. \u201cThe first bear would be the vanguard. What sort of bears are they? Cuddly and cute or fierce and growly?\u201d I don\u2019t know where you went to school, Andrew Benton, but the vanguard is looking after the escape vehicle. 90th over: Australia 387-4 (Burns 173, Patterson 27) Fernando to Patterson, trying to do the disciplined thing and just work away in the channel outside the left-hander\u2019s off stump. Patterson counters with the other disciplined thing and leaves it all. Discipline fight. 89th over: Australia 387-4 (Burns 173, Patterson 27) Kasun Rajitha from the Church End, directly in front of us here in the media centre. Some swing for him immediately. Patterson works a single, but Burns is beaten by an absolute beauty. That was aimed at middle stump so Burns came slightly across the ball. Then it swung away, beat his outside edge, and just, just crept over the off bail. Cruel for a bowler. 88th over: Australia 386-4 (Burns 173, Patterson 26) Vishwa Fernando will do the honours with the still new-ish ball. Gets Burns on the pad, and Dickwella immediately launches into his Starman appeal, singing Bowie all the while. But Umpire Illingworth\u2019s mind is not blown. You can tell why it\u2019s not out, because the ricochet is given as a run, not a leg bye. Patterson also gets moving immediately with a run into the covers. Great Southern Land gets a run on the PA for the 1,000,486th time at an Australian cricket match. Iva Davies stirs in his slumber and rolls over on his piles of diamonds and gold. Ten minutes to go. Tim Paine has been in the nets. Got a first-baller at the Gabba, so he\u2019d want to finish his season on a slightly higher personal note... One former Australia player is briefly back in the ABC comm box and also apparently back in the team huddle. Now then, if you\u2019re feeling down for any reason this morning, be cheered up by this. Hope is a bird... Graeme Vimpani! A brief thought on the Burns-Head partnership. It wrapped up yesterday at 308, meaning it was the biggest partnership since Shaun Marsh and Adam Voges towelled up a sorry West Indies team in Hobart back in 2015. That day Voges and Marsh nearly broke the all-time Australian partnership record of 451, Marsh eventually falling with the stand worth 459. So, 2015. You read that and think that it\u2019s been a while. But then if you dig a little deeper on the numbers, there have only been 22 Australian stands worth over 300 in history. Ever. Of those 22, Bradman featured in five of them. Because of course he did. But he also featured in the first, in 1934. The first 60 years of Test cricket didn\u2019t feature a single stand that big. Then there was a gap of 17 years between Bradman\u2019s last and Bill Lawry\u2019s first of two, then 20 more years before the next featuring another Marsh and Mark Taylor. The great Australian Waugh-Ponting era only produced four 300 stands between 1999 and 2006. They don\u2019t come along very often, regardless of the conditions or situation. So while people can qualify that this came against a weak Sri Lankan attack, assembling a score of this magnitude between two batsmen is still a rare achievement. As ever, the tweet lines are open via @GeoffLemonSport, and the email channel is crackling as we scroll through the stations to find geoff.lemon@theguardian.com. Get involved with the OBO, as our forebears and their forebears have done for generations. If you\u2019re getting chased by a bunch of bears, is the one at the front the forebear? Good morning or evening or afternoon all, wherever you are on our tiny blue dot. Hello also to anyone in orbit who has managed to access the uplink. (And watch out for the supercomputer, it\u2019s slowly going mad!) Australia will resume today in Canberra in a dominant position with the bat for the first time this home season, and indeed the first time in just under a year, since the Durban Test at the start of March 2018. The score is 384 for 4, a fair old recovery from 28 for 3, which was the position after a first hour of sloppy shots against pretty average bowling from an entirely new Sri Lankan seam attack forced by injury to all three bowlers who played in Brisbane. Travis Head made 161, while Joe Burns can go really big when he resumes on 172 not out. Both were dropped earlier in their innings, as was Kurtis Patterson first ball who resumes on 25. Let\u2019s just say that Sri Lanka haven\u2019t helped themselves. Head last night dedicated his hundred to another aggressive and unorthodox left-hander, the late Phillip Hughes, who mentored the younger player after moving to play for South Australia. It was an emotional moment in the middle. \u201cI just wanted to hug him as hard as I could for as long as I could,\u201d said the adorable Burns last night. If you couldn\u2019t love him any more. In other news that is unfortunately news, the teenage prodigy Will Pucovski has asked to be released from the squad to head home and keep managing his mental health. It\u2019s hard enough for any of us to do that, let alone when it\u2019s being reported on in news outlets. But that\u2019s the peril of high-profile work. So let\u2019s hope people can do the right thing and leave him alone. We\u2019ll get going in just under an hour, on another cool and cloudy day in Canberra.",

I find it hard to concentrate, and simple tasks, such as focusing on a TV programme or reading a book, are proving difficult.

A: Never B: Sometimes C: Most of the time 9) I feel lonely \u2013 even though I have lots of people around me A: Never B: Sometimes C: Most of the time 10) I feel like I\u2019d like everything to just \u201cstop\u201d for a bit \u2013 as though the world is spinning and I\u2019d like to just get off for a bit to breathe and catch up with myself A: Never B: Sometimes C: Most of the time The results Mostly A: feeling good Whatever you\u2019re doing, keep doing it. Life is ticking along nicely, and you\u2019re in a good place, so well done for putting yourself first and keeping your mental and emotional wellbeing at the top of the list of priorities. Remember it\u2019s totally normal and OK to have a blip, so if you have the odd day when you\u2019re not feeling quite so chipper that\u2019s also fine. Just make sure you take a regular step back, pause and ask yourself: \u201cHow am I feeling and what needs to happen to make me feel my best.\u201d Make sure you\u2019re eating regular healthy meals, take moderate exercise, and keep the focus on a good work/life balance. Mostly B: a bit blue OK, things have been feeling a bit \u201cmeh\u201d recently, but well done for catching how you\u2019re feeling now \u2013 the key to coping and keeping well is to actively notice when things are starting to slip, and then do something about it. Elefriends is a helpful online community from the people at Mind, where you can offload, and get support from likeminded people \u2013 you can also choose to stay anonymous if you prefer. It\u2019s important to speak to someone you trust, a friend, family member, counsellor, about how you\u2019re feeling. You may find just sharing your troubles is enough to help them improve, but you might like to seek further help and support such as therapy (art, music, dance, talking), life coaching, or mindfulness classes. Having enough \u201cme\u201d time is important; have a think about what you would like to do to give yourself some space to just \u201cbe\u201d and recharge your mind and body. Exercise is proven to help anxiety, stress and low mood, and eating well is also integral to keeping your mood on an even keel. Don\u2019t be afraid to tell those around you what you need, and how they can help you. Mostly C: time to seek some help It\u2019s really brave that you have been honest and open with yourself, and recognised that things are difficult. It sounds like you\u2019re struggling to cope with day-to-day life. It\u2019s vital that you don\u2019t suffer in silence and plod along alone. There is help out there. It would be worthwhile to see your GP as soon as possible. You could ask the receptionist if your doctor has a good knowledge and training in mental health matters; if not, ask them to recommend the best GP in the practice who specialises in this area. Perhaps take the answers to this quiz with you so the doctor can see how you\u2019re feeling \u2013 it might feel easier than having to say it all out loud. There are many ways someone who is struggling with their mental and emotional health may be supported. Medication is something that might be discussed, and talking therapy is almost always recommended. Speaking to a trained counsellor or therapist can be hugely helpful. Sessions are confidential and non-judgmental and it\u2019s a chance to offload anything on your mind, work through any difficulties, and work towards some goals to help you cope better. Your GP can help you find the right professional. Therapy is available for free on the NHS (but you may have to wait a long time for an appointment). The charity Mind, and The Counselling Directory can help too. Speak to a trusted friend and family member without delay about how you\u2019re feeling; there is no shame or embarrassment, only bravery for asking for help. Now is not the time for being alone, and you deserve to feel better. Relaxing techniques such as deep breathing, and listening to some calming positive music can help relieve anxiety symptoms and lift your mood.

      "bodyText": "British MEPs have called on EU leaders to urgently put in place a set of \u201ccontinuity rights\u201d for British nationals who may find themselves legally stranded on the continent in the event of no-deal Brexit. They say the contingency plans that are under way are not enough and will risk the rights of up to 1 million Britons settled in EU member states. The MEPs want them to have rights including ongoing inflation-linked pensions and healthcare rights, and residency and employment rights, such as so-called frontier worker rights that would allow British nationals living in one country to take a job or offer a service in another member state after Brexit. \u201cWe are writing to urgently request that you act now to ringfence the rights of citizens within the Brexit negotiations,\u201d they said in a letter to Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk, Michel Barnier and the European commission\u2019s new no-deal tzar, Martin Selmayr.

The letter was signed by 25 MEPs including Catherine Beader, Liberal Democrat MP for South-East England, Wajid Khan, Labour MEP for North-West England, Jean Lambert, Green party MEP for London, and Seb Dance, deputy leader of Labour\u2019s MEPs. They are determined that ordinary people who exercised freedom of movement should not be the collateral damage in Britain\u2019s political war. But they are worried member states are working at different speeds and that the UK will rely on 27 bilateral agreements, which may not be signed in time or be uniform in nature. \u201cWe need to harden up the contingencies for EU citizens and accept an interventionist policy across the EU because contingency plans are not continuity plans,\u201d said Claude Moraes, Labour MEP for London and chair of the civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee in the European parliament. At a recent meeting of the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group, Moraes told Selmayr that the EU had a moral duty to step into the breach. \u201cWe argued passionately at that meeting that the EC needs to be interventionist, that they need to take a strong interventionist line and this is a moral issue,\u201d said Moraes. He expects Selmayr to come back quickly with a set of strong guidelines to be issued to the member states covering the laws that need to be in place by 30 March. This would cover pensions and reciprocal free healthcare, but also healthcare coverage for citizens living in countries such as France where there is a hybrid insurance-based and state system. The development comes after campaigners for British nationals settled in the EU called on Theresa May to guarantee health cover payments for British pensioners living in the EU for at least two years to help secure wider residential rights as well as medical care in the event of a no-deal Brexit. British in Europe activists are concerned the present system, which sees the NHS reimburse the medical bills for up to 190,000 pensioners, will fall away in the event of a no-deal. In a letter to the prime minister, they said that if the current reciprocal health system, known as S1, ended it would \u201cput pensioners in an intolerable situation\u201d. UK pensioners \u201creceiving vital care on that date (eg chemotherapy for cancer) will no longer be able to get treatment under the scheme\u201d, they wrote.

The Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cOur priority is to ensure UK nationals living or working in the EU can continue to access the healthcare they need as we exit the EU. \u201cThe government has published extensive guidance for both travellers and British European residents on what to do in the event we leave the EU without a deal.\u201d A UK government spokesperson said: \u201cWe have made a unilateral offer to protect the rights of EU citizens in the UK even in the event of no deal, and we want the EU commission and member states to make similar guarantees for UK nationals living in the EU.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Everyone I know has been talking about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jan/12/how-fyre-festival-went-up-in-flames-bella-hadid-ja-rule\" title=\"\">Fyre festival documentary on Netflix</a>, and by everybody I mean the narrow cross section of people on my Facebook timeline. The film tells the story of the festival that was supposed to take place in the Bahamas in 2017, and ended in disaster. Before watching it, the two things I knew about the festival were that it involved Ja Rule, best known for shouting next to J-Lo; and the viral tweet of the lunch provided, a polystyrene box with some bread and cheese in it. (I can relate to this. I was recently in Colombia and given a \u201cvegan wrap\u201d, or three slices of tomato and a lettuce leaf. I was informed that the lettuce did the work of the wrap. I\u2019m not sure that giving the ingredients job titles changes the meal.)</p> <p>I remember, when I saw that tweet, thinking how funny it was that a bunch of privileged hipsters and social-media influencers were having a dreadful time at a festival organised by demigod-level dickheads. Watching the details of how it fell apart, and how chaotic and horrendous it must have been for all those people attending, made it much, much funnier.</p> <p>The main reason I found it so enjoyable was the journey of the main man behind Fyre, the snake-oil salesman supreme Billy McFarland. As the narrative unfolded, it became clear that everyone around Billy had begun to realise they were out of their depth. They tried to tell him this. Billy didn\u2019t listen. He stayed positive; he talked about being solution- rather than problem-oriented. He visualised the festival as being amazing. And despite being positive, and goal- and solution-oriented, it was such a colossal failure that now, anyone even named Billy should have second thoughts about visiting the Bahamas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/26/ive-found-an-app-on-my-phone-to-help-stop-my-addiction-to-my-phone\">I've found an app on my phone to help stop my addiction to my phone | Romesh Ranganathan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The message of this story is clear: wishing for something really hard isn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s a message that I find empowering, because I am fed up with successful people telling people that they just need to <em>want</em> it more. They need to set targets and work harder. If they haven\u2019t got it yet, they need to be more goal-oriented.

      "bodyText": "Everyone I know has been talking about the Fyre festival documentary on Netflix, and by everybody I mean the narrow cross section of people on my Facebook timeline. The film tells the story of the festival that was supposed to take place in the Bahamas in 2017, and ended in disaster. Before watching it, the two things I knew about the festival were that it involved Ja Rule, best known for shouting next to J-Lo; and the viral tweet of the lunch provided, a polystyrene box with some bread and cheese in it. (I can relate to this. I was recently in Colombia and given a \u201cvegan wrap\u201d, or three slices of tomato and a lettuce leaf. I was informed that the lettuce did the work of the wrap. I\u2019m not sure that giving the ingredients job titles changes the meal.) I remember, when I saw that tweet, thinking how funny it was that a bunch of privileged hipsters and social-media influencers were having a dreadful time at a festival organised by demigod-level dickheads. Watching the details of how it fell apart, and how chaotic and horrendous it must have been for all those people attending, made it much, much funnier. The main reason I found it so enjoyable was the journey of the main man behind Fyre, the snake-oil salesman supreme Billy McFarland. As the narrative unfolded, it became clear that everyone around Billy had begun to realise they were out of their depth. They tried to tell him this. Billy didn\u2019t listen. He stayed positive; he talked about being solution- rather than problem-oriented. He visualised the festival as being amazing. And despite being positive, and goal- and solution-oriented, it was such a colossal failure that now, anyone even named Billy should have second thoughts about visiting the Bahamas. The message of this story is clear: wishing for something really hard isn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s a message that I find empowering, because I am fed up with successful people telling people that they just need to want it more. They need to set targets and work harder. If they haven\u2019t got it yet, they need to be more goal-oriented. I am all for people trying to move beyond their circumstances, but the illusion that this will guarantee you your wildest dreams is a lie to keep us occupied as we head towards the apocalypse. My Facebook timeline is full of motivational quotes like, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t give up on cats, so why give up on your dreams?\u201d and \u201cLife is a bakery, so start making baguettes\u201d, and I think it\u2019s irresponsible. You are saying to people, \u201cIt\u2019s your fault you are unhappy.\u201d All these people who tell you about how they willed their success into reality are beneficiaries of luck.

On Friday the mother of a three-year-old girl became the first person to be found guilty of FGM in the UK, in a case that campaigners welcomed as a breakthrough. Since the introduction of FGM protection orders in 2015, 248 have been issued. The Anti-FGM Network is calling for a cross-department ministerial action group on FGM to be established to push the government to fund a national campaign and improve bespoke clinics and services for survivors. There are currently eight clinics in London and five across the rest of the country where women can seek help with the physical complications of FGM. But there is just one specialist paediatric clinic in the whole of the UK, and there are very few counselling services. Joy Clarke, a midwife and FGM specialist, said: \u201cWomen who have undergone FGM need a lot of psychological support. There is only one bespoke counselling service for survivors of FGM in Europe, the Dahlia Project, and that is not enough.\u201d Other recommendations include the establishment of a dedicated national FGM hotline, blanket screening of patients across all NHS registration systems and questions about FGM to be included at sexual health screenings. Police and charity workers also said more cooperation was needed from schools and wider communities to share intelligence around FGM. Insp Allen Davis, of the Met police, said there was evidence of so-called cutters working in the UK. He told the forum: \u201cThere is lots we need to do around awareness and information sharing. We need to be working with young people in schools, and to a large extent we are not where we should be with that.\u201d Leethen Bartholomew, a former social worker and head of the National FGM Centre, said while there were examples of good practice where schools had introduced FGM lesson plans, these successes needed to be far more widely replicated. \u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer that we need to start talking more about these things in schools. I\u2019ve sat in sessions with eight- and nine-year-olds which have proved very effective and children have grasped these ideas well.\u201d Charities that have devised teaching resources for children say they have experienced significant pushback from some schools in what are believed to be practising communities. Afrah Qassim, from the domestic abuse charity Savera UK, said: \u201cThere are schools that follow certain beliefs and religions that refuse to work with us or say they need to seek the consent of parents. Our main concern is the children whose parents refuse to allow them to attend these sessions are the ones most at risk. We need to make FGM part of the curriculum.\u201d Soad Omer, a programme manager at the east London-based charity Women\u2019s Health and Family Services, said she had experienced significant difficulties with schools in practising communities, and when the charity was allowed to speak to pupils, boys were often excluded from the conversation. While FGM will be included in the new relationships and sex education (RSE) curriculum to be brought in next year, it is unclear in what capacity it will feature. The chair of the Anti-FGM Network, Alex Adams, said: \u201cWe will be lobbying for mandatory basic FGM awareness training in all schools for all staff, not just teachers.

      "bodyText": "A courtroom door opens in Cuba and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-proclaimed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, walks in with a uniformed guard holding each shoulder. As he takes a chair and begins chatting with his lawyers, the man known almost universally as KSM is unrecognisable from the chubby, bleary-eyed fugitive in a white T-shirt shown in the famous photograph of his arrest almost 16 years ago. His head is shaved and covered by an Afghan wool hat, and he has grown an extensive thick beard dyed orange with henna, which sprawls out over his white robe. After his 2003 capture in Pakistan he was held and tortured in secret CIA \u201cblack sites\u201d in Afghanistan and eastern Europe for three years, before being flown to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, the US military zone in south-east Cuba. The base is now the venue for military tribunal hearings into 9/11 \u2013 arguably the biggest criminal case in US history, in terms of its 3,000 murder victims, the breadth of the investigation and its political significance. But nearly seven years after they began, those hearings are only inching forward. Minutes after Mohammed arrives, his four co-defendants are escorted in one by one: Walid bin Attash, alleged to have run an al-Qaida training camp in Afghanistan where two of the 9/11 hijackers were trained, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a Yemeni accused of helping organise logistics for the attack. Both wear camouflage jackets in court, and would have taken part in the attacks, the prosecution says, had they managed to get into the US. Next is Ammar al-Baluchi, Mohammed\u2019s nephew, alleged to have played a critical role in funding the hijackers and organising their flight school training. The fifth defendant is Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi, a Saudi accused of being a fixer for the 9/11 plot, acquiring cash, credit cards and clothing for the hijackers. They were first charged in 2008 and the military commission proceedings began in 2012. The accused are growing old, some of the witnesses have died and the trial is still a year off, at least, as the hearings have been bogged down in procedural arguments. The 33rd pre-trial hearing began on Monday. Separated from the accused by a triple-thick layer of glass, half secluded from observers by a curtain, are a handful of the victims\u2019 families. Cathy Powell\u2019s son Scott was a contractor working in the Pentagon when American Airlines flight 77 hit the building. For years she tried to flee the constant reminders of her loss. \u201cI had to move from Washington DC because I couldn\u2019t deal with walking where my son walked,\u201d Powell said.

Why can\u2019t we get this over?\u201d The families, the judge, lawyers and approved observers fly in together on a charter plane a couple of days before each hearing, and take a ferry across the bay from the airstrip to Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s eastern shore where the courtroom has been established. Camp Justice is a small outpost enclosed by fences, black netting and coils of razor wire. And it is surrounded by construction equipment, with workers on the go from before dawn to well into the evening. A $14m (\u00a310.5m) upgrade is under way, including a building for defence counsel, and an oversized holding cell for a bedridden inmate. Barack Obama failed to close the camp, and there are still 40 prisoners left. Only 12 of those have been charged, or soon will be.

So far, no new prisoners have arrived, but the construction work is a reminder that the military tribunals are likely to remain for some time. As the defence lawyers, prosecutors and observers lined up to go through security for the first court session this week, they had to negotiate a uniquely local obstacle, a 2ft-long iguana that had taken up position across the court entrance. The reptiles are protected and the top commandment on the list of ground rules posted around the base is to do them no harm. They seem entirely unfazed by the base\u2019s human visitors. But for the humans, iguanas are the least of the hazards involved in organising the most complex capital case in the country on a remote island using an improvised hybrid legal system.

In order to contact anyone involved in the programme, the defence has to go through the government. For the defence lawyer Alka Pradhan, the obstacles to investigating what happened in the black sites are just the latest effort to cover up state-sponsored torture, which, for her, is in the dock alongside the accused. \u201cThere has always been a deliberate effort by the government to keep these proceedings secret and my opinion is that if the public actually saw what was going on down here, they would be outraged,\u201d Pradhan said. \u201cThere has never been any reckoning in the United States regarding the torture programme.\u201d There are several other constraints on the defence that would be unthinkable in federal court, especially in a death penalty case.

Had coming to the camp and seeing proceedings firsthand brought any peace? \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s over, it will.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 8 February 2019. An earlier version described Guant\u00e1namo as a \u201cUS military enclave\u201d; this has been changed to \u201cUS military zone\u201d.",

It\u2019s approaching midday and we\u2019re sitting in Chucs, the cafe and restaurant housed in the Zaha Hadid-designed extension to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/25/serpentine-sackler-gallery-marquee-battling\" title=\"\">Serpentine Sackler Gallery</a> in London, having walked around her new exhibition. The fine-featured artist is wearing C\u00e9line earrings and a white shirt from her Wales Bonner line, with colourful, crocheted cuffs that, she says, resemble stuff her gran would have in the house. \u201c \u2026 Silly,\u201d she finally says.</p> <p>Silly? For some in the fashion business, silliness is their raison d\u2019etre. Not Wales Bonner, though. For the past four years she has created the kind of beautifully layered, finely cut, deeply referential clothing that\u2019s so beautiful it has ended up in a few of the best shops in the world, and so brainy that it comes with its own reading list. Now, she has repurposed that aesthetic sense and sensibility into a smart, weighty, fine-art gallery exhibition. There\u2019s no room for silliness. In fact, Wales Bonner appears to regard silliness in pretty much the same way that Superman regards kryptonite.</p> <p>On graduating from Central Saint Martins in 2014, this brilliant designer won the L\u2019Or\u00e9al Professionnel Talent award. In 2015 she picked up emerging menswear designer at the British fashion awards. The following year it was the LVMH young designer prize, and in 2018 she won the British Land London emerging design medal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"504f4ae7700c8621f44f4a38d6f8a99bbe8bf777\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/504f4ae7700c8621f44f4a38d6f8a99bbe8bf777/501_28_1524_3803/401.jpg\" alt=\"Wales Bonner design at London Collections Men SS17.\" width=\"401\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wales Bonner design at London Collections Men SS17.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Estrop/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her label, Wales Bonner, is stocked at high-profile stores such as Dover Street Market and Selfridges, she has lectured at Parsons School of Design in New York, been profiled in GQ, the Gentlewoman and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/sep/05/30-years-vogue-anna-wintour-changed-way-world-gets-dressed\">Vogue</a> and had her garments displayed at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum.</p> <p>In the fashion world, you could liken her to Richard Malone, another young Central Saint Martins graduate with an equally innovative approach to the medium; yet it\u2019s probably better to compare her with her friends, such as the American fine artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/dec/11/arthur-jafa-video-artist-love-is-the-message\">Arthur Jafa</a>, or the British recording artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/feb/02/sampha-sissay-process-review-young-turks\" title=\"\">Sampha</a>.</p> <p>In the Serpentine Sackler Gallery there isn\u2019t a piece that you\u2019d expect to see in the pages of a glossy magazine. Instead, it has videos, photography, music, books, sculpture and live performances. There are a couple of works by Wales Bonner herself but most of it is by artists she admires. The show is excellent; it has an international, spiritual, mystic feel \u2013 there are quite a few works that resemble shrines \u2013 and it draws its title, A Time for New Dreams, from a 2011 collection of essays by the Nigerian poet, novelist and Man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/sep/06/ben-okri-camus-etranger-theatre\" title=\"\">Booker prize winner Ben Okri</a>.</p> <p>Wales Bonner asked Okri to write a series of texts for the gallery\u2019s walls, and she was very relieved when he said yes: \u201cIt\u2019s given me a real confidence, that such important people have trusted me.\u201d Okri\u2019s consent might have surprised her, but it probably didn\u2019t come as a shock to those around her. She\u2019s remarkably focused and determined.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was at secondary school, I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to be a historian or an artist,\u201d she says. That school was in Tooting, south London; Wales Bonner lived with her mum in Dulwich, and visited her dad in Stockwell. \u201cI spent a lot of time on the bus,\u201d she remembers. \u201cWhich meant I saw a lot of different styles of clothing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c335c958e84795a709f3a6b1fce7576a730035a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c335c958e84795a709f3a6b1fce7576a730035a/748_222_1310_786/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Time for New Dreams at the Serpentine Sackler Gallery.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laraaji, Transformation 2019, part of A Time for New Dreams at the Serpentine Sackler Gallery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those bus rides weren\u2019t spent daydreaming. \u201cI remember going past Streatham, and we\u2019d stop at a mosque and we\u2019d see people getting on and off with trainers, sportswear and traditional dress,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI would travel through these different mixes of people and that had quite a deep influence on my ideas about style.\u201d</p> <p>Wales Bonner\u2019s mum is white and from England and her dad is Jamaican. She recalls spending time with her Jamaican relatives and browsing through her dad\u2019s collection of books. \u201cHe was into all sorts of things,\u201d she says, \u201cRomanticism, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/31/dylan-thomas-prize-sally-rooney-michael-donkor-nana-kwame-adjei-brenyah-sarah-perry\">Dylan Thomas</a>, stuff like that.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t really think about her own racial identity until she went to secondary school. \u201cPeople would say I was black, and black people would say I was white,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something that held me back but it was definitely interesting. I had to negotiate an identity.\u201d</p> <p>This is, in part, why she\u2019s so keen on art and history. \u201cI started getting very interested in photography, finding archival material,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was about seeing reflections of yourself; knowledge isn\u2019t given to you, you\u2019ve got to spend time creating threads for yourself.\u201d</p> <p>The post-colonial British period was her main interest, though she doesn\u2019t get too heavy. \u201cIt was more like stories,\u201d she says. \u201cHistories are just stories and what I do connects to storytelling.\u201d</p> <p>She applied to Central Saint Martins almost on a whim, and found that clothes design was an unusually good fit. \u201cSaint Martins opened me up to fashion,\u201d Wales Bonner says. \u201cI\u2019m big into creating history and research, and fashion is one outcome. What I do in fashion could be considered in a wider context; it could be opened up to expose my thought processes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f34ede225e1aad1fb3eea63084eca8f420d34b23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f34ede225e1aad1fb3eea63084eca8f420d34b23/35_119_2430_1457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shrine I 2019, part of A Time for New Dreams.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shrine I 2019, part of A Time for New Dreams.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: readsreads.info</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wales Bonner says the Serpentine show draws together the kind of material she would usually pull together \u2013 albeit in a less formal way \u2013 when making a collection of clothes. In the past, these collections have been inspired by the court dress of Haile Selassie, emperor of Ethiopia; the ballrooms of early 20th-century Harlem; and jazz mystic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/17/alice-coltrane-london-jazz-festival\" title=\"\">Alice Coltrane\u2019s </a>Californian ashram years.</p> <p>Her forthcoming haute couture collection, Mumbo Jumbo, which will be shown in the gallery at the end of the show\u2019s run during London fashion week, takes its name from another book, this time a 1972 novel by the US novelist Ishmael Reed. There\u2019s a video of Reed in the exhibition, and Wales Bonner says the black, intellectual dress sense of Reed and others, such as the US artist David Hammons and New Yorker writer Hilton Als, shaped her new collection.</p> <p>\u201cWhen someone has a strong presence you know what their vibe is, and you see that in intellectuals,\u201d she explains. \u201cThey\u2019re serious people. There\u2019s conviction, and continuity over time. There\u2019s tailoring but it\u2019s integrated with something a bit more intimate. There\u2019s something about the way they use clothes, the way they put things together, that no one else would think of.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was creating this idea in my mind of the shamanic artist who collects things,\u201d she says. \u201cHe will go to a market and pick out a particular scarf, or wear something more feminine. They\u2019re super comfortable with themselves, they gather together things and they\u2019re quite nomadic. There\u2019s a delicacy and intimacy, wearing these things that are quite magical.\u201d</p> <p>Does that mysticism extend to Wales Bonner herself? Could she ever see herself being a shaman? \u201cEr, yeah, I don\u2019t \u2026 \u201d she laughs briefly, breaking an otherwise clear and precise series of responses; she seems both slightly annoyed and amused by the question.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"85c0b37f5fb26119d713421449f1e834fb62e1a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85c0b37f5fb26119d713421449f1e834fb62e1a5/391_0_2215_3909/567.jpg\" alt=\"Wales Bonner, London Collections Men SS17.\" width=\"567\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wales Bonner, London Collections Men SS17.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Estrop/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although Wales Bonner now designs for both men and women, she first made her name with menswear, and is glad to be designing for guys at a time when the rules around male dress are a bit less rigid. \u201cI got into menswear at an exciting time,\u201d she says. \u201cMy work is about male representation and there is a fluidity, boundaries are opening up. I think people are communicating sensuality and femininity on more of a spectrum. That\u2019s much more in the cultural consciousness and it allows things to be understood in a different way.\u201d</p> <p>Some topics, at least in terms of today\u2019s interview, are off the table. She\u2019d prefer not to talk about racial bias in the fashion business \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not that interested in answering that\u201d \u2013 and also demurs on the topic of the Sackler family, the Serpentine Sackler Gallery benefactors whose pharmaceutical company, Purdue Pharma, produces Oxycontin, the pill at the heart of America\u2019s opioid crisis: \u201cI\u2019d prefer not to comment,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Yet on other subjects Wales Bonner is quite open. She hopes the show will expose her work to a much wider audience, and doesn\u2019t want to put off casual, Saturday afternoon gallery goers. \u201cSometimes these spaces can be intimidating,\u201d she admits. \u201cI hope people feel welcome. I leave behind a bibliography with everything I do, which is there if people want to explore more.\u201d</p> <p>Some artworks take a bit of unpacking but others, such as the performances from Laraaji, a cult African-American musician who plays Eno-style ambience using zithers, thumb pianos and effects pedals, are simply transcendent.</p> <p>Wales Bonner says she hopes inclusions like this will turn the gallery into a chilled, meditative space. \u201cI want people to think they can slow down in the space and reflect,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d42c74877b329d150b7b334e38e9974b65c6eeb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d42c74877b329d150b7b334e38e9974b65c6eeb7/239_733_6490_3893/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wales Bonner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wales Bonner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s an odd proposal for older contemporary art gallery-goers, who are used to knotty, highbrow shows. However, A Time for New Dreams opened the same week as new figures from UK charity the Art Fund showed that people under 30 are twice as likely to visit a museum or gallery at least once a month to \u201cde-stress\u201d. Perhaps this mystic, ritualistic show is just what they need.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/23/hans-ulrich-obrist-art-curator\">Hans-Ulrich Obrist</a>, artistic director of the Serpentine Galleries, who commissioned the show, says: \u201c[Russian director Andrei] Tarkovsky said back in the 1980s that we have a lack of ritual in our lives. We need to reintroduce rituals; I think that is something we really need to do. And dreams, too. Ben Okri says that some books can be dream books; we need dreams again, also.\u201d</p> <p>Both Wales Bonner and Obrist are fans of Okri, who has combined aspects of Nigerian history with west African folkloric traditions and magical realism to reach a wide readership. Okri\u2019s Booker prize winner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/jan/20/booker-club-famished-road\" title=\"\">The Famished Road</a>, was the first novel Obrist read when he arrived in London in the mid-1990s. Wales Bonner was equally taken with A Time for New Dreams, which hit her hard when she came across it in 2011. \u201cI was so excited,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was such a proposition for our times.\u201d</p> <p>Her favourite bit in the book is about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/feb/08/pablo-picasso-art\">Pablo Picasso\u2019s</a> use of African masks.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI am a fashion designer,\u201d says 28-year-old Londoner Grace Wales Bonner, \u201cdoing an art show, which could be seen as \u2026 \u201d She looks away as she searches for the right word. It\u2019s approaching midday and we\u2019re sitting in Chucs, the cafe and restaurant housed in the Zaha Hadid-designed extension to the Serpentine Sackler Gallery in London, having walked around her new exhibition. The fine-featured artist is wearing C\u00e9line earrings and a white shirt from her Wales Bonner line, with colourful, crocheted cuffs that, she says, resemble stuff her gran would have in the house. \u201c \u2026 Silly,\u201d she finally says. Silly? For some in the fashion business, silliness is their raison d\u2019etre. Not Wales Bonner, though. For the past four years she has created the kind of beautifully layered, finely cut, deeply referential clothing that\u2019s so beautiful it has ended up in a few of the best shops in the world, and so brainy that it comes with its own reading list. Now, she has repurposed that aesthetic sense and sensibility into a smart, weighty, fine-art gallery exhibition. There\u2019s no room for silliness. In fact, Wales Bonner appears to regard silliness in pretty much the same way that Superman regards kryptonite. On graduating from Central Saint Martins in 2014, this brilliant designer won the L\u2019Or\u00e9al Professionnel Talent award. In 2015 she picked up emerging menswear designer at the British fashion awards. The following year it was the LVMH young designer prize, and in 2018 she won the British Land London emerging design medal. Her label, Wales Bonner, is stocked at high-profile stores such as Dover Street Market and Selfridges, she has lectured at Parsons School of Design in New York, been profiled in GQ, the Gentlewoman and Vogue and had her garments displayed at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. In the fashion world, you could liken her to Richard Malone, another young Central Saint Martins graduate with an equally innovative approach to the medium; yet it\u2019s probably better to compare her with her friends, such as the American fine artist Arthur Jafa, or the British recording artist Sampha. In the Serpentine Sackler Gallery there isn\u2019t a piece that you\u2019d expect to see in the pages of a glossy magazine. Instead, it has videos, photography, music, books, sculpture and live performances. There are a couple of works by Wales Bonner herself but most of it is by artists she admires. The show is excellent; it has an international, spiritual, mystic feel \u2013 there are quite a few works that resemble shrines \u2013 and it draws its title, A Time for New Dreams, from a 2011 collection of essays by the Nigerian poet, novelist and Man Booker prize winner Ben Okri. Wales Bonner asked Okri to write a series of texts for the gallery\u2019s walls, and she was very relieved when he said yes: \u201cIt\u2019s given me a real confidence, that such important people have trusted me.\u201d Okri\u2019s consent might have surprised her, but it probably didn\u2019t come as a shock to those around her. She\u2019s remarkably focused and determined. \u201cWhen I was at secondary school, I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to be a historian or an artist,\u201d she says. That school was in Tooting, south London; Wales Bonner lived with her mum in Dulwich, and visited her dad in Stockwell. \u201cI spent a lot of time on the bus,\u201d she remembers. \u201cWhich meant I saw a lot of different styles of clothing.\u201d Those bus rides weren\u2019t spent daydreaming. \u201cI remember going past Streatham, and we\u2019d stop at a mosque and we\u2019d see people getting on and off with trainers, sportswear and traditional dress,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI would travel through these different mixes of people and that had quite a deep influence on my ideas about style.\u201d Wales Bonner\u2019s mum is white and from England and her dad is Jamaican. She recalls spending time with her Jamaican relatives and browsing through her dad\u2019s collection of books. \u201cHe was into all sorts of things,\u201d she says, \u201cRomanticism, Dylan Thomas, stuff like that.\u201d She didn\u2019t really think about her own racial identity until she went to secondary school. \u201cPeople would say I was black, and black people would say I was white,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something that held me back but it was definitely interesting. I had to negotiate an identity.\u201d This is, in part, why she\u2019s so keen on art and history. \u201cI started getting very interested in photography, finding archival material,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was about seeing reflections of yourself; knowledge isn\u2019t given to you, you\u2019ve got to spend time creating threads for yourself.\u201d The post-colonial British period was her main interest, though she doesn\u2019t get too heavy. \u201cIt was more like stories,\u201d she says. \u201cHistories are just stories and what I do connects to storytelling.\u201d She applied to Central Saint Martins almost on a whim, and found that clothes design was an unusually good fit. \u201cSaint Martins opened me up to fashion,\u201d Wales Bonner says. \u201cI\u2019m big into creating history and research, and fashion is one outcome. What I do in fashion could be considered in a wider context; it could be opened up to expose my thought processes.\u201d Wales Bonner says the Serpentine show draws together the kind of material she would usually pull together \u2013 albeit in a less formal way \u2013 when making a collection of clothes. In the past, these collections have been inspired by the court dress of Haile Selassie, emperor of Ethiopia; the ballrooms of early 20th-century Harlem; and jazz mystic Alice Coltrane\u2019s Californian ashram years. Her forthcoming haute couture collection, Mumbo Jumbo, which will be shown in the gallery at the end of the show\u2019s run during London fashion week, takes its name from another book, this time a 1972 novel by the US novelist Ishmael Reed. There\u2019s a video of Reed in the exhibition, and Wales Bonner says the black, intellectual dress sense of Reed and others, such as the US artist David Hammons and New Yorker writer Hilton Als, shaped her new collection. \u201cWhen someone has a strong presence you know what their vibe is, and you see that in intellectuals,\u201d she explains. \u201cThey\u2019re serious people. There\u2019s conviction, and continuity over time. There\u2019s tailoring but it\u2019s integrated with something a bit more intimate. There\u2019s something about the way they use clothes, the way they put things together, that no one else would think of.\u201d \u201cI was creating this idea in my mind of the shamanic artist who collects things,\u201d she says. \u201cHe will go to a market and pick out a particular scarf, or wear something more feminine. They\u2019re super comfortable with themselves, they gather together things and they\u2019re quite nomadic. There\u2019s a delicacy and intimacy, wearing these things that are quite magical.\u201d Does that mysticism extend to Wales Bonner herself? Could she ever see herself being a shaman? \u201cEr, yeah, I don\u2019t \u2026 \u201d she laughs briefly, breaking an otherwise clear and precise series of responses; she seems both slightly annoyed and amused by the question. Although Wales Bonner now designs for both men and women, she first made her name with menswear, and is glad to be designing for guys at a time when the rules around male dress are a bit less rigid. \u201cI got into menswear at an exciting time,\u201d she says. \u201cMy work is about male representation and there is a fluidity, boundaries are opening up. I think people are communicating sensuality and femininity on more of a spectrum. That\u2019s much more in the cultural consciousness and it allows things to be understood in a different way.\u201d Some topics, at least in terms of today\u2019s interview, are off the table. She\u2019d prefer not to talk about racial bias in the fashion business \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not that interested in answering that\u201d \u2013 and also demurs on the topic of the Sackler family, the Serpentine Sackler Gallery benefactors whose pharmaceutical company, Purdue Pharma, produces Oxycontin, the pill at the heart of America\u2019s opioid crisis: \u201cI\u2019d prefer not to comment,\u201d she says. Yet on other subjects Wales Bonner is quite open. She hopes the show will expose her work to a much wider audience, and doesn\u2019t want to put off casual, Saturday afternoon gallery goers. \u201cSometimes these spaces can be intimidating,\u201d she admits. \u201cI hope people feel welcome. I leave behind a bibliography with everything I do, which is there if people want to explore more.\u201d Some artworks take a bit of unpacking but others, such as the performances from Laraaji, a cult African-American musician who plays Eno-style ambience using zithers, thumb pianos and effects pedals, are simply transcendent. Wales Bonner says she hopes inclusions like this will turn the gallery into a chilled, meditative space. \u201cI want people to think they can slow down in the space and reflect,\u201d she says. That\u2019s an odd proposal for older contemporary art gallery-goers, who are used to knotty, highbrow shows. However, A Time for New Dreams opened the same week as new figures from UK charity the Art Fund showed that people under 30 are twice as likely to visit a museum or gallery at least once a month to \u201cde-stress\u201d. Perhaps this mystic, ritualistic show is just what they need. Hans-Ulrich Obrist, artistic director of the Serpentine Galleries, who commissioned the show, says: \u201c[Russian director Andrei] Tarkovsky said back in the 1980s that we have a lack of ritual in our lives. We need to reintroduce rituals; I think that is something we really need to do. And dreams, too. Ben Okri says that some books can be dream books; we need dreams again, also.\u201d Both Wales Bonner and Obrist are fans of Okri, who has combined aspects of Nigerian history with west African folkloric traditions and magical realism to reach a wide readership. Okri\u2019s Booker prize winner, The Famished Road, was the first novel Obrist read when he arrived in London in the mid-1990s. Wales Bonner was equally taken with A Time for New Dreams, which hit her hard when she came across it in 2011. \u201cI was so excited,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was such a proposition for our times.\u201d Her favourite bit in the book is about Pablo Picasso\u2019s use of African masks. For many other writers, Picasso\u2019s use of African art in his own paintings and sculptures was an inspired, though slightly troubling, case of cultural appropriation. However, in A Time for New Dreams, Okri flips this. \u201cHe retells the story, and has the masks take control of Picasso, to bring him their genius,\u201d says Wales Bonner, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s their intention; they possess him. That was so radical, that made me think in a completely different way.\u201d Perhaps that is the sort of magic we could all use today. Grace Wales Bonner: A Time for New Dreams is at the Serpentine Sackler Gallery, W2, to 16 February",

      "body": "<p>When I was 13 years old, when I knew I was queer but wouldn\u2019t be saying so for a year, I remember some boys at school during lunch talking about gay sex. They called it \u201cgross\u201d, they laughed about it. That\u2019s what I heard from my peers about the topic. I heard nothing from my teachers; I wasn\u2019t about to ask my parents; and the gay people on TV never did more than peck each other on the lips.</p> <p>Sex education for teens is one of those topics we tend to dance around. No one wants to talk to them about sex. It sounds pervy to tell kids how to have sex \u2013 as if you\u2019re ruining their innocence or, worse, grooming them. I don\u2019t know what your sex education was like, but I remember mine: it was putting condoms on bananas.</p> <p>Fun fact about bananas: they\u2019re all genetically identical. Every banana you\u2019ve eaten is the same as every other banana you\u2019ve eaten. And many of the sex-education classes taught today are exactly the same as the one I attended more than a decade ago. Condoms on bananas, STDs, reproduction \u2013 no talk of pleasure or consent, much less gay sex.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The message is clear across all media: gays have to be kept sexless because they\u2019re already too much about sex</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So, I wrote a novel for teens that features guides to oral sex, anal sex, and basic BDSM. I didn\u2019t do this just so people had someone new to send hate mail to; I did it because teens have heard all this already from TV, playground talk, and online porn. Even sheltered teens already have some idea about how sex works; pretending they don\u2019t isn\u2019t going to help anyone. And while not all of them want to try these things, those who do, need to know how to do it safely, and with consent. Instead, they learn all of that from the media.</p> <p>In most media aimed at teens, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/10/gay-men-tv-stereotypes-looking-sexuality\" title=\"\">queer men tend to be sweet and sexless</a>. You\u2019ve seen or read the gay best friend character who talks about how hot guys are but never touches one. Or you\u2019ve experienced mainstream gay romance \u2013 with gentle kissing, hand-holding, maybe a hug (fully clothed). Even when they get to say what they want, these boys on TV or in film rarely long for more than a kiss and a cuddle. We never see the mimed, under-the-covers sexy-and-shirtless making-out that our straight peers are treated to. Straight teens get to have sex on TV. Gay ones, not so much.</p> <p>There\u2019s this thing I call the glass closet: the idea that liberal-minded, well-meaning folks who genuinely don\u2019t think they have a problem with queer people tend to confine them to a rigid definition of \u201cgood\u201d queerness. For women, this means not going too butch, usually. For men, it means not going too femme, and also, not being too slutty. \u201cI love gay people, but do they have to be so in-your-face about it?\u201d; \u201cI love gay people \u2013 but not being \u2018too gay\u2019, OK guys?\u201d</p> <p>And gay sex? That\u2019s way too gay.</p> <p>Society likes to keep gay teens sexless. It likes to maintain that gay content (even something non-sexual, like the representation of gay parents) is inappropriate for children\u2019s TV or books. Those who complain say it\u2019s too adult \u2013 implying that queerness, essentially, is all about sex, while straightness is just what a normal relationship looks like. It\u2019s a weird dichotomy: straight people holding hands are non-sexual, while queer people holding hands is somehow the same as broadcasting pornography. The message is clear across all media: gays have to be kept sexless because they\u2019re already too much about sex.</p> <p>And so, if all the gay teenagers on our screens are portrayed as \u201cgood\u201d gays, kept safely in the confines of the glass closet, and sex-ed doesn\u2019t discuss more than bananas and STDs, then real queer teens turn to the one place they can see their desires: porn.</p> <p>If you haven\u2019t seen any gay (male) porn, let me describe most of it: everything is clean and polished (yes, even most of the dirty stuff). Everyone has lots of vocal fun. No one ever flags until they finish.</p> <p>Of course, porn is fantasy, and the men in these videos do massive prep for these scenes. It looks much easier than it is \u2013 that\u2019s half the fantasy. And as fantasy, it\u2019s fine. But as a primary source of education, gay porn leaves young queer men with an idealised, routine set of acts that suggest a (wrongly) regimented set of requirements for \u201creal\u201d queer sex. Standardised sexual imagery, it turns out, is just bananas with abs.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The lesbian sex in mainstream porn is designed for male visual pleasure. So queer women have to navigate male sexuality</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019ve also spoken to queer women about their sexual education. They didn\u2019t always go to porn for their sex-ed, but they didn\u2019t find it at school or home either. Those who did look for it in porn had the additional problem that the fantasy being presented wasn\u2019t even being presented for them.</p> <p>\u201cMany young women will encounter lesbian sex through mainstream porn,\u201d says Allison Moon, sex educator and author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Girl-Sex-101-Allison-Moon/dp/0983830959\" title=\"\">Girl Sex 101</a>. \u201cThis means everyone, not only girls, can get some very wrong ideas about lesbian sex, because the lesbian sex in mainstream porn is designed for male visual pleasure. So queer women have to navigate male sexuality whether or not it interests them.\u201d</p> <p>And that leaves queer teens in sex-education classes in an awkward place. Straight teens can ask about things they\u2019ve seen on TV, they can apply condoms-on-bananas to what they learn from the media, and come away with a basic framework of sex. Queer teens can only turn to porn.</p> <p>The good news is that, in some places, things are changing. When I contacted my old high school to find out how the condom bananas were going, I spoke to the director of health and wellness about how the sex-education curriculum has changed, and how it\u2019s about to change even further.</p> <p>\u201cWe can do better, and we\u2019re on the cusp,\u201d she told me, before going into future plans: a curriculum that covers the usual safe-sex issues, but also talks about consent, healthy relationships, porn literacy and queer sex. I was thrilled to hear it. I may have even become a little teary, thinking about a class of young queer people who get a real sexual education that applies to them.</p> <p>But not every school does this. And they need to, because queer people are everywhere. We\u2019ve made strides in acceptance, but today I still see gay men in their 20s and 30s online saying they don\u2019t know how things work. I get emails from men saying my book taught them things they wish they had learned as a teen. Teens today tell me that it\u2019s so nice to hear someone talk about gay teens having sex, about how they feel, as though, even if they\u2019re out, they\u2019re still not allowed to act on their desires \u2013 or are unsure how.</p> <p>Right now, teenagers\u2019 choices for learning are two extremes (the \u201cgood gay\u201d or the \u201cbad gay\u201d) \u2013 neither of which is helpful. Either way, these teens end up feeling as if they\u2019ve done something wrong. And we can fix that so easily. Just start talking about it, teaching it. We do it with straight sex. We can fix this the way we can fix most things in life: just gay it up.</p> <h2>What gay teens should watch and read</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443431/\" title=\"\">Another Gay Movie </a>(2006)</strong> A raunchy teen sex comedy about four gay guys trying to lose their virginity before graduating.

      "bodyText": "Next time you make an extra round of toast that you don\u2019t get time to eat, or you slightly burn a piece that you\u2019d rather not eat, don\u2019t chuck it in the food waste bin. Instead, blend it up into a morning shake, or turn it into a comforting soup or a burnt-toast sorbet. (To make the soup, simply blend it with a handful of cooked chestnuts and enough stock until creamy in consistency, then season with a little extra-virgin olive oil, miso, mustard, salt and pepper.) Of course, if your toast is black as night, it might be beyond salvaging, but if it\u2019s just a little charred, scrape or cut off and discard anything that is properly burned and leave it on a plate to dry out. You can then keep it indefinitely to use like stale bread, or to thicken sauces and stews, to which it will impart just a hint of that nostalgic, toast-y flavour. Today\u2019s recipe is an oat-based sorbet, but the approach works equally well with a traditional ice-cream base. Serve sandwiched between two other slices of cold toast spread with honey or anything else sweet you fancy. To serve four, soak 100g oats and a piece of toast in 600ml boiling water for 30 minutes. Blend for one to two minutes with a tablespoon of olive oil, 100g honey and a pinch of salt. Churn in an ice-cream machine, if you have one; otherwise, put the mixture in a container in the freezer and fork through thoroughly every 30 minutes for five or six repetitions. For best results, serve the same day, once the mixture is firm enough to shape into a ball. Burnt toast sorbet The flavour of this sorbet is surprisingly nostalgic. To maintain a good creamy texture, it\u2019s best made and eaten on the same day. Serves four. 100g oats 1 thick slice leftover toast (about 60g) 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive olive oil 100g honey or other sweetener 1 pinch salt Soak the oats and toast in 600ml boiling water for 30 minutes. Blend at high speed the olive oil, honey and a pinch of salt for one to two minutes, until very smooth. Leave the mixture to cool down and, once it\u2019s cold, churn in an ice-cream machine and serve. Otherwise, transfer the mix to a container, then freeze, forking through it every 30 minutes or so for five or six repetitions, mixing thoroughly to break up the ice crystals. Serve once it\u2019s firm enough to shape into a ball.",

We both ate with our hands, struggled to pronounce the dishes on the menu, and neither of us could use chopsticks.</p> <p><strong>Best thing about Ben?<br></strong>He\u2019s got a lovely smile. And (spoiler alert) he can really throw some shapes on the dance floor.</p> <p><strong>Would you introduce him to your friends?<br></strong>I did! We met up with some after dinner. One of my best friends threatened to break his kneecaps if he didn\u2019t give me full marks.</p> <p><strong>Describe Ben in three words</strong><strong><br></strong>Jaunty, charming, fun.</p> <p><strong>What do you think he made of you?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019d say he was won over by my willingness to sing Tonight from West Side Story with him on the escalators at Tottenham Court Road.</p> <p><strong>Did you go on somewhere?</strong></p> <p>Yeah, to a little pub and then to a gay club in Soho, where we danced into the wee hours of the morning.</p> <p><strong>And... did you kiss?<br></strong>We certainly did.</p> <p><strong>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?<br></strong>Nothing, really. As Ben said, it was a \u201cbanging\u201d night. Even the queue into the club was entertaining (he gave a girl who pushed ahead of us a piece of his mind).</p> <p><strong>Marks out of 10?<br></strong>9.5</p> <p><strong>Would you meet again?<br></strong>Yes, I would.</p> <h2>Ben on Charlie</h2> <p><strong>What were you hoping for?<br></strong>Hopes were high for an unexpected and crazy evening out with lovely company.</p> <p><strong>First impressions?</strong></p> <p>Very friendly, trendy, and he gave me a lovely warm welcome.</p> <p><strong>What did you talk about?</strong></p> <p>Theodore, crying at films, Brighton, our mutual love of the Quintet from West Side Story, and latterly, dad dancing.</p> <p><strong>Any awkward moments?<br></strong>One of his friends said that I need to give him a 10 if I value my kneecaps.</p> <p><strong>Best thing about Charlie?<br></strong>Very easy to get along with, and happy to bitch with me about the queens in the queue.</p> <p><strong>Would you introduce him to your friends?<br></strong>We bumped into several of them last night and they got along well \u2013 so yes.</p> <p><strong>Describe Charlie in three words</strong><strong><br></strong>Cheery, easy-going, high-spirited.</p> <p><strong>What do you think he made of you?<br></strong>Probably quite energetic, hopefully quite outgoing, possibly terrible at dancing.</p> <p><strong>Did you go on somewhere?<br></strong>Yes, as we journeyed between places we sang West Side Story and the Wizard Of Oz. We also told everyone we could that we were on a Guardian blind date.</p> <p><strong>And\u2026 did you kiss?<br></strong>Maybe a little.</p> <p><strong>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?<br></strong>Nothing.</p> <p><strong>Marks out of 10?<br></strong>9.5</p> <p><strong>Would you meet again?<br></strong>We swapped numbers.</p> <p>\u2022 Charlie and Ben ate at Pho, London E1, <a href=\"https://www.phocafe.co.uk/locations/spitalfields/\" title=\"\">phocafe.co.uk</a>.

      "bodyText": "Charlie on Ben What were you hoping for? Anything from losing my knickers to finding a future husband. First impressions? I was delighted. He was handsome, smiley, and we shared a big hug. What did you talk about? Musicals, long gay plays, Gay Pride, how wonderful our waiter Theodore was, what we could do to become famous off the back of this column. Any awkward moments? We clashed over our favourite songs in Jesus Christ Superstar. Good table manners? Absolutely. We both ate with our hands, struggled to pronounce the dishes on the menu, and neither of us could use chopsticks. Best thing about Ben? He\u2019s got a lovely smile. And (spoiler alert) he can really throw some shapes on the dance floor. Would you introduce him to your friends? I did! We met up with some after dinner. One of my best friends threatened to break his kneecaps if he didn\u2019t give me full marks. Describe Ben in three words Jaunty, charming, fun. What do you think he made of you? I\u2019d say he was won over by my willingness to sing Tonight from West Side Story with him on the escalators at Tottenham Court Road. Did you go on somewhere? Yeah, to a little pub and then to a gay club in Soho, where we danced into the wee hours of the morning. And... did you kiss? We certainly did. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? Nothing, really. As Ben said, it was a \u201cbanging\u201d night. Even the queue into the club was entertaining (he gave a girl who pushed ahead of us a piece of his mind). Marks out of 10? 9.5 Would you meet again? Yes, I would. Ben on Charlie What were you hoping for? Hopes were high for an unexpected and crazy evening out with lovely company. First impressions? Very friendly, trendy, and he gave me a lovely warm welcome. What did you talk about? Theodore, crying at films, Brighton, our mutual love of the Quintet from West Side Story, and latterly, dad dancing. Any awkward moments? One of his friends said that I need to give him a 10 if I value my kneecaps. Best thing about Charlie? Very easy to get along with, and happy to bitch with me about the queens in the queue. Would you introduce him to your friends? We bumped into several of them last night and they got along well \u2013 so yes. Describe Charlie in three words Cheery, easy-going, high-spirited. What do you think he made of you? Probably quite energetic, hopefully quite outgoing, possibly terrible at dancing. Did you go on somewhere? Yes, as we journeyed between places we sang West Side Story and the Wizard Of Oz. We also told everyone we could that we were on a Guardian blind date. And\u2026 did you kiss? Maybe a little. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? Nothing. Marks out of 10? 9.5 Would you meet again? We swapped numbers. \u2022 Charlie and Ben ate at Pho, London E1, phocafe.co.uk. Fancy a blind date? Email blind.date@theguardian.com. If you\u2019re looking to meet someone like-minded, visit soulmates.theguardian.com",

Writing in 1969, Horne decided that the Britain of what he called the northern metaphor was \u201cpragmatic, empirical, calculating, Puritan, bourgeois, enterprising, adventurous, scientific, serious and believes in struggle\u201d; while in the southern metaphor the same country was \u201cromantic, illogical, muddled, divinely lucky, Anglican, aristocratic, traditional, frivolous, and believes in order and tradition\u201d.

Both of them concluded that \u201cBritain is best\u201d \u2013 but, to quote Horne, \u201cin the contest as to what Britain was best <em>at</em> [his italics] it was, on the whole, the southern metaphor that won\u201d. Fifty years later, the qualifying \u201con the whole\u201d is no longer necessary: the southern idea of what the country represents has won hands down, though that country is now England rather than Britain and avarice has moved south from its original headquarters \u2013 or so the cliche about muck and brass suggests \u2013 in the villas of the northern industrialists.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2019/jan/12/brexit-remainer-leave-voters-labour-northern-people\">I\u2019m a remainer.

Prof Wiener\u2019s book appeared at a propitious time, just as Margaret Thatcher\u2019s policies began to make serious inroads into manufacturing industry, and it became celebrated for its cultural explanation of Britain\u2019s industrial failure: basically, that the country\u2019s moneymakers and technical pioneers wanted to be landed aristocrats more than they wanted to continue as industrialists, and had little sustained appetite for manufacturing.</p> <p>England was among the most densely populated, urbanised and polluted countries in the world. The factory owner\u2019s ambition was to become a hunting-pink member of an older, more rural regime, a pose that reflected a popular ambivalence towards the grimy and unhealthy processes that had made the country rich. Britain\u2019s downward slide \u2013 relative to competitor nations such as the United States and Germany \u2013 had begun long before the 19th century was over.</p> <p>Horne\u2019s metaphors suited this argument, but that was all I knew of them until a few weeks ago when a generous reader of this column sent me a copy of Horne\u2019s book God is an Englishman, where they originally appeared. God is an Englishman is long out of print \u2013 any copies to be found online date from 1970 and have been buried (metaphorically) by references to a novel of the same title by RF Delderfield that appeared soon after. Perhaps Delderfield\u2019s novel confused the market; perhaps Penguin didn\u2019t put enough effort into selling copies of a book that it imported from Australia: for whatever reason, a clever and prescient analysis of Britain never got the public attention it deserved.</p> <p>The Britain Horne describes is the country I came of age in: the world\u2019s third nuclear power, the greatest owner of overseas assets after the US, the financier of a third of world trade and (how incredible this now seems) the world\u2019s second biggest exporter. Compared with nations of roughly equal population, it was twice as prosperous as Italy and eight times as prosperous as Nigeria, and outdid or rivalled another island nation, Japan, in most indicators of wellbeing. But were the people happy? To be third in the league table of synthetic rubber production, Horne wrote, didn\u2019t \u201ccheer up\u201d a nation that had got used to the idea, often fallacious, of being first in anything it turned its hand to. In his judgment, \u201cThe British have not been taught to be thankful for their great mercies \u2026 They have not yet learned to talk in a new way about their past, their present, and their future.\u201d</p> <p>Out of this inarticulacy had come the muddle that Horne thought was symptomatic of the southern metaphor. There was pride in both bigness and smallness: \u201cThe British could not \u2013 and still cannot \u2013 imagine what size they are.\u201d As for \u201cthe long 20th century twilight of the northern metaphor\u201d, Horne chose to illustrate it with a brilliant examination of the word \u201cprovincial\u201d, with all its implications of the dowdy and the second rate.</p> <p>In contrast to other countries, the definition wasn\u2019t dictated by geography. \u201cThe English do not see rural villages as provincial, or ancient cathedral towns that happen to be in the provinces.

Meanwhile what he described as the \u201cindestructible vanity\u201d of London has increased, as the management of money became more important to the British economy than any other enterprise. In this way, to read Horne\u2019s book now is to see a country being planted with the seeds of division and delusion, the crop ready for harvest in 2016.</p> <p>Today, many people and several newspapers still believe that British institutions are \u201ca paradigm of what political and judicial things should be\u201d, while retaining \u201ca feeling that [similar] institutions \u2018abroad\u2019 are in reality gimcrack\u201d. I read that sentence this week on the same day the European parliament debated the British government\u2019s new proposal. In 2014, it is worth remembering, Ukip had 24 of the 73 MEPs elected by the UK. Thanks to splits, defections and fisticuffs, only seven of them retain the party label, but the rest remain as independents, the whole rackety ensemble drawing their \u00a37,000 a month salaries and generous expenses, and shouting boorishly at speeches made by other members.

      "bodyText": "The Trump administration\u2019s \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d policy aimed at deterring asylum seekers, especially at the southern border, is illegal and a human rights violation, the head of Amnesty International in the United States has said. By law, the US is required to allow asylum seekers to file a request for asylum, but the Trump administration has implemented policies designed to prevent that from happening, including placing Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officers at the international boundary to ask travelers for documentation before getting to the port of entry. \u201cFirst and foremost the policy is a violation of US and international law and clearly a human rights violation. If the US recognized that an individual has a credible fear of persecution you can\u2019t send them somewhere else \u2013 it is on the obligation of the state to offer protection and not delegate it to some third party,\u201d Margaret Huang, the executive director for Amnesty International US, told the Guardian this week. Huang cited a memo from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that was leaked last month showing the intent of the Trump administration to traumatize migrant children and parents to deter migrants coming to the US. Huang said the newest policy appeared to be an extension of previous efforts to shortcut all legal avenues for migrants to come into the country. \u201cIt really is throwing the entire system into chaos. It feels like the US government is saying: \u2018Lets make things as complicated as confusing as possible so we deter people from coming and if they try, we\u2019ll make it so hard for them and make them feel miserable,\u2019,\u201d Huang said. Speaking to the Guardian in El Paso, the border city in west Texas, Huang was accompanied on a visit there by a delegation of more than 20 members of Amnesty International, including directors from Ireland, Belgium, Norway, Canada and Mexico aimed at learning more about the repercussions of the new policy, which intends to send asylum seekers arriving across the southern border back to Mexico while their cases go through the immigration court system. The policy strand is just one amid Trump\u2019s crackdown on both lawful and unlawful immigration. The group visited San Diego in California and the Mexican city directly across the border, Tijuana, on 28 January and El Paso and it\u2019s Mexican \u201ctwin city\u201d, which shares the border fence and Rio Grande waterway cutting through downtown, Juarez on 30-31 January.

Advocates say that just like the previous policies the policy to make asylum seekers wait, or remain in Mexico will incentivize then to try to enter the country illegally, which can facilitate their removal and denial of asylum if they are caught by border patrol or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) federal agents. And it all makes their journeys and their situation after crossing the border that much more perilous, even deadly, especially for children. Despite the challenges that lay ahead, Huang said the collaboration between advocates and service providerslends some optimism. \u201cWhat gives me hope is the community of advocates and providers and volunteers who spend more than 40 hours a week thinking about how to help this population,\u201d Huang said. \u201cWithout those private shelters none of these folks would have a shot of getting asylum and without these providers, many more of them would be dead.\u201d",

But for Leonardo to now be dragged into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/29/france-and-italy-war-of-words-steps-up-as-elections-approach\">long-running political spat</a> between Italy\u2019s far-right ruling League party and France\u2019s centrist president, Emmanuel Macron, has saddened historians and worried the museum world.</p> \n<p>Negotiations have been stepped up this month to calm the row created when Lucia Borgonzoni, a League MP and undersecretary at the ministry of culture, recently suggested that her government would cancel the loan of some key paintings and drawings agreed two years ago with Italian museums, accusing France of trying to take centre stage in Leonardo commemorations and \u201cputting Italy on the margins of a major cultural event\u201d. To make her point, she added: \u201cLeonardo is Italian; he only died in France.\u201d</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/03/beyonce-jay-z-help-louvre-museum-break-visitor-record\">Louvre </a>show is to open in October, as not to overshadow Italian commemorations in May. The museum holds five of only 14 paintings attributed to Leonardo \u2013 but had wanted to source from Italy some works considered robust enough to travel. In turn it was to lend Rome certain Raphael works for an exhibition next year. Keen to calm the row, the Louvre has made no public comment.</p> \n<p>The Leonardos being sought by the Louvre from Italy are thought to include the famous drawing, Vitruvian Man, which is in Venice, as well as the unfinished painting, Saint Jerome in the Wilderness.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f43ab56d4dd8789f30c811074a31e8e0105b2f67\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f43ab56d4dd8789f30c811074a31e8e0105b2f67/0_243_7285_4370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There is a blue sky with the reflection of the Museum Louvre with the Pyramid\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Louvre show is to open in October, as not to overshadow Italian commemorations of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s death in May.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MathieuRivrin/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The French culture minister, Franck Riester, has said the deadlock needed to be dealt with through \u201cpeaceful\u201d talks. He will meet his Italian counterpart, Alberto Bonisoli, next month to try to agree a deal.

      "bodyText": "He was a Renaissance master \u2013 painter, scientist, engineer and inventor \u2013 who was hailed as one of the greatest artists who ever lived. But as Europe stages a year-long frenzy of events to mark 500 years since Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s death, Italy and France are engaged in a diplomatic tussle over him that threatens a blockbuster exhibition at the Louvre in Paris. Leonardo, born the illegitimate son of a notary in the Tuscan hill town of Vinci in 1452, was an Italian humanist who spent his final years at the court of Francis I in the Loire, where he died on 2 May 1519. His life and work has been subject to constant myth-making and legend \u2013 including the famous Ingres painting of him dying in the arms of the Valois king, who was in fact elsewhere baptising his son that day. But for Leonardo to now be dragged into the long-running political spat between Italy\u2019s far-right ruling League party and France\u2019s centrist president, Emmanuel Macron, has saddened historians and worried the museum world. Negotiations have been stepped up this month to calm the row created when Lucia Borgonzoni, a League MP and undersecretary at the ministry of culture, recently suggested that her government would cancel the loan of some key paintings and drawings agreed two years ago with Italian museums, accusing France of trying to take centre stage in Leonardo commemorations and \u201cputting Italy on the margins of a major cultural event\u201d. To make her point, she added: \u201cLeonardo is Italian; he only died in France.\u201d The Louvre show is to open in October, as not to overshadow Italian commemorations in May. The museum holds five of only 14 paintings attributed to Leonardo \u2013 but had wanted to source from Italy some works considered robust enough to travel. In turn it was to lend Rome certain Raphael works for an exhibition next year. Keen to calm the row, the Louvre has made no public comment. The Leonardos being sought by the Louvre from Italy are thought to include the famous drawing, Vitruvian Man, which is in Venice, as well as the unfinished painting, Saint Jerome in the Wilderness. The French culture minister, Franck Riester, has said the deadlock needed to be dealt with through \u201cpeaceful\u201d talks. He will meet his Italian counterpart, Alberto Bonisoli, next month to try to agree a deal. Bonisoli said he was not against the Leonardo loan agreement, but that there were some \u201cimbalances\u201d in the original deal that needed to be ironed out. The minister is member of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which is in power with the League. \u201cI hope [the meeting] happens soon as this situation of a diplomatic stalemate not only affects the Leonardo [events] but also paralyses all the exchanges with French museums, and this is a disaster,\u201d said Barbara Agosti, art history professor at Tor Vergata University in Rome and a member of the committee overseeing the 500-year celebrations in Italy. \u201cThis situation has been conducted in a clumsy manner \u2013 but the thing that loses the most in all of this is the story of art. It\u2019s a pity for Italian and French museums, she added. The spotlight is on other events opening in France, including at the Beaux-Arts Paris which has on display four Leonardo drawings as part of am exhibition of Renaissance drawings, many not seen in public before. The art school\u2019s location is significant because of another France-Italy row after the theft of the Mona Lisa from the Louvre in 1911. After two years of police bafflement and misplaced suspicions around Pablo Picasso and the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, the Leonardo painting was discovered in Florence, stolen by an Italian criminal. It was duly brought back to Paris and went first to the Beaux-Arts school to be certified as authentic where it was put on public display for two days. In more myth-making around Leonardo, the thief argued at the time that he wanted to return the Mona Lisa to its his rightful home after France stole it. But in fact the painting was taken by Leonardo to France in 1516 and bought by Francis. Jean de Loisy, the head of the Beaux-Arts, said: \u201cThere is a universal passion for history and one of the world\u2019s biggest artists cannot be reduced to base politics.

Flood warnings remained in place for the following catchments: Mulgrave, Russell, Tully, Murray, Herbert, Ross, Bohle, Haughton, Burdekin, Don, Isaac, Leichhardt, Nicholson, Gregory, Flinders, Cloncurry and Diamantina Rivers.

And unlike what the Democrats say, they don\u2019t, you don\u2019t bring trucks of drugs through the checkpoints. You bring trucks of drugs by making a right 20 miles, and a left into the country.\u201d</p> \n  <p>This is false. Most of the heroin entering the United States does come across the southern border, but most of it passes through ports of entry, <a href=\"https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2018-11/DIR-032-18%202018%20NDTA%20final%20low%20resolution.pdf#page=31\">according to</a> the Drug Enforcement Administration. About 90% of heroin seized was at ports of entry from Oct. 1, 2017, to Aug. 30, 2018, compared to 10% in areas between checkpoints.<br></p> \n  <p>On tariffs, Trump said: \u201cWe have 25 percent now on $50 billion. And by the way, Peter, that\u2019s a lot of money pouring into our Treasury, you know. We never made 5 cents with China. We\u2019re getting right now 25 percent on $50 billion.\u201d</p> \n  <p>This is also false, the Times found. It is American companies and consumers paying the tariffs, not the Chinese. It is also untrue that the Treasury Department never collected any revenue from tariffs on Chinese products before Trump\u2019s term. President George Washington signed the first tariffs applying to China in 1789. <br> </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c545309e4b072f2ace1af46\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/julianborger\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-01T14:10:10.538Z\">2.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>It is clear that Trump himself did not write this statement. It is formally worded with none of the president\u2019s verbal tics, and it is sharply critical of Russia.<br></p> \n  <p>It leaves open the possibility that the INF treaty could be saved within the six months before US withdrawal takes effect. But it sets a high bar, requiring Russia to destroy \u201call of its violating missiles, launchers, and associated equipment\u201d.</p> \n  <p>That has been Washington\u2019s position all along by the US negotiator Andrea Thompson. She has not been prepared to examine a compromise involving inspections of the suspect Russian missile and possible tweaks to limit its range.</p> \n  <p>Trump claims that \u201cour NATO allies fully support us\u201d. That is not entirely true. The allies agree that Russia is violating the INF treaty but do not agree with the US walking out of the treaty, which they believe still restrains Russian freedom of action in deploying missiles.</p> \n  <p>Western European countries are fearful this will lead to a new arms race on European soil, a rerun of the tense 1980\u2019s. Some Eastern European countries meanwhile would host new US medium-range missiles as a guarantee that the US would come to their defence.</p> \n  <p>Trump says his administration remains \u201ccommitted to effective arms control\u201d but neither he nor Mike Pompeo addressed the question of extending the New Start treaty, the last arms control agreement currently constraining the arsenals of the big nuclear weapons powers.

More from AP:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>An American withdrawal, which has been expected for months, would follow years of unresolved dispute over Russian compliance with the pact, known as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty. It was the first arms control measure to ban an entire class of weapons: ground-launched cruise missiles with a range between 500 kilometers (310 miles) and 5,500 kilometers (3,400 miles). Russia denies that it has been in violation. </p> \n   <p>U.S. officials also have expressed worry that China, which is not party to the 1987 treaty, is gaining a significant military advantage in Asia by deploying large numbers of missiles with ranges beyond the treaty\u2019s limit. Leaving the INF treaty would allow the Trump administration to counter the Chinese, but it\u2019s unclear how it would do that. </p> \n   <p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in early December that Washington would give Moscow 60 days to return to compliance before it gave formal notice of withdrawal, with actual withdrawal taking place six months later. The 60-day deadline expires on Saturday, and the administration is expected to say as early as Friday that efforts to work out a compliance deal have failed and that it would suspend its compliance with the treaty\u2019s terms. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-01T13:48:16.811Z\">at 1.48pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c544b63e4b0d86c56436e05\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-01T13:39:36.043Z\">1.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The US jobs market has now added jobs for a record 100 months in a row, shaking off last month\u2019s government shutdown to add 304,000 jobs in January, according to the latest jobs report released Friday.</p> \n  <p>But the unemployment rate ticked up slightly in January, to 4%.</p> \n  <p>The current streak of job creation began in October 2010, and is now more than twice as long as the previous record, a 48-month run that ended in 1990.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c5449fee4b072f2ace1aec1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-01T13:33:47.404Z\">1.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In other happenings today, Donald Trump is holding a late morning meeting to discuss fighting human trafficking on the southern border, and then will depart at 4pm for his Mar a Lago club in Florida.</p> \n  <p>Roger Stone, the president\u2019s close associate who was indicted last week, is due back in court this afternoon. </p> \n  <p>The Trump administration is expected to announce that it is withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty, according to the Associated Press. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c5446abe4b0d86c56436da5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-01T13:17:17.118Z\">1.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In Cory Booker\u2019s first radio interview after announcing his run for president, he called for the legalization of marijuana, according to the New York Times.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt means changing our drug laws.

A \u201cracist and offensive\u201d yearbook photo from the Virginia governor Ralph Northam\u2019s past resurfaced, prompting outrage and calls for his resignation. Donald Trump goes on Face the Nation to talk about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, just before jetting off to his beloved Mar-a-Lago. Sign up for our morning briefing for a new perspective on the US. We\u2019ll email you a summary of the day\u2019s top stories and must-reads. Subscribe now. With the government shutdown over, President Trump can finally return to Mar-a-Lago, the Associated Press is reporting. Trump typically spends many winter weekends at the Palm Beach estate, golfing at another nearby private club he owns and dining on an outdoor terrace at Mar-a-Lago, where he catches up with friends and club members. But that routine was interrupted by the partial government shutdown, which ended a week ago after a record 35 days. The president curtailed his travel during the shutdown, dropping Mar-a-Lago from the itinerary as he sought to avoid travel that would not play well when one-fourth of the government was closed and hundreds of thousands of federal workers had to make do without pay. The 2020 presidential candidates are weighing in on Virginia Governor Ralph Northam\u2019s \u201cracist and offensive\u201d yearbook photo of a man in blackface and a man in a KKK hood. President Trump will appear on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday, telling Margaret Brennan that Speaker Nancy Pelosi is \u201cvery bad for our country.\u201d Here\u2019s an excerpt from the interview, in which he also tells Brennan that he thinks presidential hopeful and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker has \u201cno chance.\u201d MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me just finish this bit on Congress because you had quite the showdown with Speaker Pelosi. What did you learn about negotiating with her? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well I think that she was very rigid - which I would expect - but I think she\u2019s very bad for our country. She knows that you need a barrier. She knows that we need border security. She wanted to win a political point. I happen to think its very bad politics because basically, she wants open borders. She doesn\u2019t mind human trafficking or she wouldn\u2019t do this. MARGARET BRENNAN: She offered you $1 billion for border security. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me? MARGARET BRENNAN: She offered over a billion dollars for border security. She doesn\u2019t want the wall. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: She\u2019s- she\u2019s costing the country hundreds of billions of dollars because what\u2019s happening is when you have a porous border and when you have drugs pouring in, and when you have people dying all over the country because of people like Nancy Pelosi who don\u2019t want to give proper border security for political reasons she\u2019s doing a terrible disservice to our country. And on the fifteenth we have now set the table beautifully because everybody knows what\u2019s going on because of the shutdown. People that didn\u2019t have any idea - they didn\u2019t have a clue what was happening - they now know exactly what\u2019s happening. They see human trafficking. They see drugs and gangs and criminals pouring in. Now we catch them because we\u2019re doing a great job. But if we had proper border security we wouldn\u2019t have to work so hard and we could do an ever better job. And I think Nancy Pelosi is doing a terrible disservice to the people of our country. But she can\u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: You\u2019re still going to have to deal with her though. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, she can keep playing her games but we will win because we have a better issue. On a political basis what she\u2019s doing is \u2013 I actually think it\u2019s bad politics, but much more importantly it\u2019s very bad for our country. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam released a statement apologizing for the blackface/KKK yearbook photo and admitting that he was wearing one of the \u201cracist and offensive\u201d costumes \u2013 but he did not not identify which one he wore. Virginian Republicans are calling for Democratic Governor Ralph Northam to step down after a photograph from what appears to be his 1984 medical school yearbook page shows a person dressed as a member of the Ku Klux Klan and another wearing blackface, the New York Times is reporting. \u201cThere are more drunks than old doctors in this world so I think I\u2019ll have another beer,\u201d reads the section, which also identified Dr. Northam\u2019s alma mater as Virginia Military Institute and his medical interest as pediatrics. A spokeswoman for the governor did not respond to a message on Friday. The existence of the photograph was first reported by the website Big League Politics, and Eastern Virginia Medical School provided a copy of the yearbook page on Friday afternoon. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie \u201cmight run for president again\u201d, BuzzFeed is reporting \u2013 just not against President Trump. Christie, who published a political memoir this week, underlined that he has no interest in ever being a long-shot candidate. \u201cMy personality is about having a chance to win,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m competitive. And so if I had a chance to win, I would do it.\u201d He said he\u2019s had people come up to him on his book tour already who have said they want him to challenge Trump in 2020. But he ruled that out, saying he\u2019s \u201cnot interested.\u201d \u201cIn 2024, I\u2019ll be 62 years old. It\u2019s still 10 years younger than the president is now. And like 15 years younger than Joe Biden. So, you know, the field is open. 60 is the new 50.\u201d Hey all, Vivian Ho on the West Coast, taking over for Adam Gabbatt. Happy Friday! I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Vivian Ho on the west coast now. Here\u2019s where things stand: Cory Booker announced his bid for president. The Senator kicked off his campaign with a hopeful message of inclusivity, promising: \u201cWe will rise\u201d. Booker was elected in 2013 in New Jersey, becoming the state\u2019s first black senator. A judge is considering imposing a gag order in the Roger Stone case. No ruling has been made yet, and Judge Amy Berman Jackson said that if a gag order is imposed, it would apply only to the pending case. But the judge Stone not to treat the lead up to his trial \u201clike a book tour\u201d. Donald Trump said there\u2019s a \u201cgood chance\u201d he\u2019ll declare a national emergency in order to build his border wall. \u201cWe will be looking at national emergency because I don\u2019t think anything\u2019s going to happen. I think the Democrats don\u2019t want border security,\u201d Trump said. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the US is pulling out of a key nuclear treaty. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty bans long-range, ground-launched cruise missiles, but the Trump administration argued that Russia has been violating the pact.

I\u2019ve had two emails from the Trump campaign today, both requesting ideas for his State of the Union address. \u201cI need your input before preparing my speech,\u201d the first email begins. \u201cNancy &amp; Chuck don\u2019t want me to speak, Mainstream Media outlets don\u2019t want me to speak, and the Hollywood Elites don\u2019t want me to speak,\u201d it continues. \u201cBut I know, Adam wants me to speak.\u201d [sic] There\u2019s a link to what Trump is calling the \u201cOfficial State of the Union Prep Survey\u201d, where people can chip in their thoughts ahead of Trump\u2019s big night. Here\u2019s a clip from Cory Booker\u2019s announcement event earlier today, where he said he would not abolish private healthcare. The issue of scrapping private healthcare entirely, versus implementing a single-payer system that still allows companies to offer private healthcare, could be one of the defining issues of the Democratic primaries. The Medicare for all bill introduced by Bernie Sanders, which some members of the Senate have backed, would effectively abolish private healthcare \u2013 by prohibiting insurers from offering plans which compete with government-run healthcare. President Donald Trump will say to a divided U.S. Congress in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday that Republicans and Democrats can \u201cbreak decades of political stalemate,\u201d according to an excerpt released by the White House, Reuters reports: Trump will call on Congress to send him legislation to fund infrastructure projects, will update lawmakers on China trade talks and urge them to approve his trade pact with Canada and Mexico that would replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) a senior administration official told reporters on Friday. \u201cTogether we can break decades of political statement, we can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of America\u2019s future. The decision is ours to make,\u201d Trump will say. Senator Jeff Merkley will bring an immigrant mother and child separated at the border to the State of the Union as his guests. Albertina Contreras Teletor and her daughter Yakelin Garcia Contreras, who is turning 12 on Tuesday, will join the Oregon Democrat, CNN reported. The invitation will \u201chighlight the human suffering caused by President Trump\u2019s child separation policy,\u201d Merkley\u2019s office said. The Onion is poking some fun at Senator Cory Booker\u2019s reputation as a corporate-friendly Democrat. Parkland shooting survivor and gun control activist Cameron Kasky will attend the State of the Union speech as the guest of California Rep. Eric Swalwell. \u201cIn the face of unimaginable tragedy, Cameron Kasky has shown remarkable strength,\u201d Swalwell said Friday, according to the Hill. \u201cHe stands at the forefront of the fight for action to address gun violence ... I\u2019m proud to have Cameron join me at the U.S. Capitol, nearly one year after he faced a horror no kid should endure at school, to continue this fight, because there is no right more important than the right to live.\u201d The Trump administration\u2019s top health official asked Congress on Friday to pass its new prescription drug discount plan and provide it to all patients, not just those covered by government programs like Medicare, the Associated Press reports: The plan would take now-hidden rebates among industry players like drug companies and insurers and channel them directly to consumers when they go to pay for their medications. Patients with high drug copays stand to benefit from the proposal, while people who take no prescription drugs, or who rely on generics mainly, would probably pay somewhat more, since premiums are expected to rise. A day after unveiling the plan as a proposed regulation, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar raised the stakes by calling on Congress to make it law and broaden it to include people covered by employer health insurance, not just Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. \u201cCongress has an opportunity to follow through on their calls for transparency ... by passing our proposal into law immediately and extending it into the commercial drug market,\u201d Azar said in a speech at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank. The Los Angeles city attorney\u2019s office will not bring misdemeanor charges over domestic violence allegations against lawyer Michael Avenatti. City Attorney Mike Feuer said his office will hold hearings on the allegations and the matter remains open, but they have declined for now to bring charges, according to the Associated Press. Actress Mareli Miniutti accused Avenatti - known for representing Donald Trump\u2019s alleged paramour Stormy Daniels - in November of dragging her by the arm across a bedroom floor of his apartment after an argument. The Los Angeles district attorney previously declined to bring felony charges, leaving it to the city attorney to consider a misdemeanor prosecution. Avenatti said he was vindicated by the decision. The informal hearings will allow both sides to present evidence and charges could be brought after that, per AP. A court has ordered Avenatti not to contact or be near Miniutti. A judge is considering imposing a gag order in the Roger Stone case, but no ruling has been made yet, CNN reports. Stone appeared in court in Washington, DC Friday. The judge gave prosecutors and Stone\u2019s lawyers until February 8 to make arguments on the issue. Judge Amy Berman Jackson said that if a gag order is imposed, it would apply only to the pending case, so Stone would still be free to talk about foreign relations or Tom Brady, according to CNN. But she warned of the risk of Stone treating the lead up to his trial \u201clike a book tour,\u201d and expressed concern it could taint the jury pool. She said the case is \u201ca criminal proceeding, not a public relations campaign,\u201d according to the Los Angeles Times. CNN reported that government prosecutors said they are looking at a trial date in October for Stone, who is accused of lying to Congress about the Russia investigation. Senator Cory Booker answered questions from reporters outside his home in Newark, New Jersey as he kicked off his presidential bid. On whether his campaign centered on a message of love would be tough enough to take on Donald Trump, he said, \u201cLove ain\u2019t easy.\u201d Some of the most heroic figures in history, he added, are \u201cfolks that took on armed hate, bully club and dogs and fire hoses, with unarmed love, and they took down Jim Crow.\u201d Asked if he - like former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who made a failed run for president in 2016, would neglect his job duties during his run, he promised he would not. \u201cThe voters of New Jersey put their faith in me, and I will never ever let them down. I\u2019m going to continue to be an active force in the Senate.\u201d In response to criticism he is too friendly to corporate interests, he cited his work to prohibit credit cards from overcharging customers. \u201cWhatever you do when you\u2019re in elected office, you\u2019re going to get criticism,\u201d he said. As for criticism from the Republican National Committee that he had left Newark a crime-ridden mess, he said that was tantamount to \u201cputting down our urban spaces\u201d and \u201cridiculing, demeaning and degrading them.\u201d He said that Newark under his watch built new office towers and hotels, opened supermarkets in food deserts, and improved the public schools. When he finished his term the city\u2019s population was growing for the first time in decades, he said. On his fervent support for charter schools, he said he intends to run \u201cthe boldest pro-public school teacher campaign there is,\u201d and noted the state\u2019s teachers union endorsed his Senate bid. He said he would not shy away from his positions. \u201cI believe that we shouldn\u2019t have one size fits all education,\u201d he said. Asked whether he believes Trump is a racist, Booker said, \u201cI don\u2019t know the heart of anybody. I\u2019ll leave that to the Lord.\u201d But he said Trump has failed \u201cto condemn bigotry and racism,\u201d and said of his comments calling African nations \u201cshithole\u201d countries and questioning a judge\u2019s rulings because of his Hispanic heritage, \u201cThat\u2019s bigoted language and there\u2019s no way around that.\u201d Foxconn Technology said Friday it will build a factory in Wisconsin after the company\u2019s chairman spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump, Reuters reports: Reuters reported earlier this week that Foxconn was reconsidering plans to make advanced liquid crystal display panels at a planned $10 billion Wisconsin campus. But after conversations between Trump and Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou, the company said it would now move \u201cforward with our planned construction of a Gen 6 fab facility,\u201d which is a type of plant that produces displays. The 20-million square foot campus marked the largest investment for a brand new location by a foreign-based company in U.S. history when it was announced at a White House ceremony in 2017. It was praised by Trump as proof of his ability to revive American manufacturing. The apparent reversal was seized upon by Democrats in Congress this week. Trump tweeted Friday: \u201cGreat news on Foxconn in Wisconsin after my conversation with Terry Gou!\u201d Louis Woo, special assistant to Gou, told Reuters on Wednesday that Foxconn wants to create a technology hub in Wisconsin that would largely consist of research facilities. \u201cIn Wisconsin we\u2019re not building a factory,\u201d Woo said. Foxconn said that global market conditions had \u201cnecessitated the adjustment of plans for all projects, including Wisconsin.\u201d The company\u2019s statement Friday reiterated that the \u201ccampus will serve both as an advanced manufacturing facility as well as a hub of high technology innovation for the region.\u201d Foxconn\u2019s statement did not reiterate its commitment to create 13,000 jobs as it did on Wednesday. Republicans in South Dakota have introduced a bill to shorten the early voting period there. The legislation would shrink the days of early voting from 46 days to 14, KELO reported. The scene on Cory Booker\u2019s block in Newark, via Yahoo News. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway\u2019s take on Senator Cory Booker\u2019s run for president: \u201cI think Cory Booker often sounds like a Hallmark card, and not necessarily a person who\u2019s going to tell you everything he\u2019s accomplished in the United States Senate and as mayor of Newark.\u201d \u201cI imagine the crowded Democratic field of presidential aspirants will be attacking each other\u2019s records or lack thereof, so we\u2019ll be sitting back with copious bowls of popcorn watching that,\u201d Conway said Friday. But she said that as a former New Jersey resident, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s in Senator Booker\u2019s record that he\u2019s going to be able to point to and say, \u2018Let me bring this to the entire nation.\u2019\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House that he has little faith negotiations between the parties in Congress will produce an agreement on the wall. \u201cWe will be looking at national emergency because I don\u2019t think anything\u2019s going to happen. I think the Democrats don\u2019t want border security,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting nowhere with the Democrats. We\u2019re not going to get anywhere with them.\u201d Trump forced a month-long government shutdown by refusing to approve a government funding bill unless it contained wall money. But he then agreed to a three-week funding bill, saying that if there\u2019s no deal by the time it expires, he\u2019ll either declare an emergency or there will be another shutdown. \u201cI think there\u2019s a good chance that we\u2019ll have to do that,\u201d he said of the emergency declaration Friday. Meanwhile, Trump continued to argue that the US is already building sections of the wall with what he called \u201ccash on hand.\u201d What\u2019s actually going on is renovations and replacements on sections of border barrier that existed before Trump took office. There were 654 miles of barrier along the 1,954 mile border before Trump took office, according to the New York Times, but no new sections have been built during his administration. Construction of another 14 mile section is set to begin in February. \u201cThe chant now should be, \u2018Finish the wall,\u2019\u201d Trump said Friday in a new spin on his campaign chant. Senator Elizabeth Warren has apologized to the Cherokee nation for her decision to take a DNA test to prove her Native American heritage. Warren called Bill John Baker, principal chief of the Cherokee nation, on Thursday to apologize, a spokeswoman for the tribe told the New York Times. \u201cShe apologized for causing confusion on tribal sovereignty and tribal citizenship and the harm that has resulted,\u201d said spokeswoman Julie Hubbard said. \u201cThe chief and secretary of state appreciate that she has reaffirmed that she is not a Cherokee nation citizen or a citizen of any tribal nation.\u201d The Massachusetts senator, who is running for president, sparked controversy when she released the test which found she had a Native American ancestor six to 10 generations ago. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Trump administration is \u201c is risking an arms race and undermining international security and stability\u201d by pulling out of a nuclear arms control treaty with Russia \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think she has a clue. I really don\u2019t think Nancy has a clue,\u201d Trump said in response while speaking to reporters at the White House. \u201cShe\u2019s hurting our country very very badly.\u201d Trump said Russia has been in violation of the treaty. \u201cOne side has not been adhering to it. We have, but one side hasn\u2019t. So unless they\u2019re going to adhere, we shouldn\u2019t be the only one,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be put at the disadvantage of going by a treaty limiting what we do when somebody else doesn\u2019t go by that treaty.\u201d He expressed the hope that the US and Russia could negotiate a \u201cnew treaty that would be much better.\u201d Here\u2019s former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie with some advice for Cory Booker, in an interview with the Washington Post. \u201cHe was someone who was pro-voucher, he was pro-charter school, he was somebody who was tough on crime in the city of Newark. If he stays in that lane, and is the articulate, inspirational guy that he is, then I think he\u2019s got a legitimate chance to be a serious potential problem for the president in the general election,\u201d Christie said. \u201cIf he goes way wacky left, then he\u2019s just going to be another one of those people, and he won\u2019t be able to distinguish himself. I like him. He\u2019s a friend.\u201d The former Republican governor is drawing attention to some aspects of Booker\u2019s record he may not be eager to highlight in a Democratic primary. In particular, Booker is well known for his support of charter schools. It\u2019s a position that has always been controversial but had a significant constituency within the Democratic party not long ago, including in the Barack Obama administration. But the party has moved in the other direction as of late, and is more closely embracing teachers\u2019 unions that have fought charters in cities like Los Angeles. Senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris will bring as her guest to the State of the Union Trisha Pesiri-Dybvik, a federal worker who went without a paycheck during the government shutdown while attempting to rebuild her home after it was destroyed in a wild fire. Harris might be Donald Trump\u2019s most formidable challenger, if you ask Trump himself. \u201cI would say the best opening so far would be Kamala Harris,\u201d he told the New York Times Thursday, pronouncing her name \u201cKameela.\u201d \u201cI would say in terms of the opening act, I would say, would be her.\u201d Trump praised Harris\u2019s campaign kick-off event, saying she had \u201ca better crowd \u2014 better crowd, better enthusiasm.\u201d \u201cSome of the others were very flat,\u201d he went on. \u201cI do think Elizabeth Warren\u2019s been hurt very badly with the Pocahontas trap,\u201d he said, referring to the derisive nickname he has given the Massachusetts senator over her claims to Native American heritage. \u201cI think she\u2019s been hurt badly. I may be wrong, but I think that was a big part of her credibility, and now all of a sudden it\u2019s gone.\u201d In an interview on The View, Senator Cory Booker addressed his competitors in the Democratic primary field, which includes fellow senators Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand, whom he considers friends. \u201cThey are friends, they are sisters. There will be some sibling rivalry, but at the end of the day, we\u2019re family,\u201d he said. Pressed on what sets him apart from the rest of the field, Booker noted he\u2019s the only candidate who lives in an urban center. \u201cI still live in the central ward of Newark, New Jersey - the only senator that goes home to a community that\u2019s still a low-income, inner city community,\u201d he said. Host Meghan McCain asked Booker about his much-mocked \u201cI am Spartacus\u201d moment during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. In that exchange, Booker said he was going to release confidential documents in violation of Senate rules, which could theoretically have been punished with expulsion from the senate. Other senators stepped up to say that they too would violate the rule, prompting Booker to say, \u201cThis is about the closest I\u2019ll ever have in my life to an \u2018I am Spartacus\u2019 moment.\u201d McCain said the moment was not \u201cthe best reflection\u201d of Booker. \u201cI hope people go back and watch that whole clip, because even that was twisted. What we do in this culture right now, it\u2019s a tear down culture\u201d the New Jersey senator responded. \u201cThat was one of my prouder moments, sticking up for people.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign ended 2018 with $19.2 million in the bank, the Hill reports. Trump\u2019s campaign and fundraising committees raised more than $21 million in the last three months of the year, according to a Federal Election Commission filing. Donald Trump tweeted a defense this morning of his moves to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan. Senator Elizabeth Warren raised more than $299,000 online the day she launched her presidential exploratory committee, according to a new Federal Election Commission filing reported by Politico. There were more than 8,000 individual donations to the Massachusetts senator on Dec. 31, with an average gift of $37. Cory Booker\u2019s policy agenda in his presidential run includes a plan to give newborn babies savings accounts worth tens of thousands for when they turn 18 and a proposed federal jobs guarantee the Washington Post reports. He\u2019ll also propose a plan to stop anti-competitive hiring practices and monopolies, and a refundable housing credit program that would aim to help Americans struggling to pay rent. His criminal justice proposals include legalizing marijuana, giving federal money to areas hurt by the war on drugs, improving the treatment of incarcerated women, and increasing funding for public defenders, aides told the Post. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway suggested Senator Cory Booker should be accused of sexism for running against several women already in the 2020 Democratic presidential field. \u201cWhat is wrong with the candidates that are already in there?\u201d she said on Fox &amp; Friends, Politico reported. \u201cWhat is your objection to Kamala Harris running, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, these others who have already announced, Tulsi Gabbard maybe? If he were a Republican running against them, they immediately would call him a sexist for running against these women in the Democratic field.\u201d There\u2019s still a chance that the INF nuclear treaty could be salvaged in the next six months, if Russia destroys missiles and launchers, the Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger reports. \u201cThis is in reality, under international law, Russia\u2019s final chance,\u201d a senior administration official said. \u201cIf there is to be an arms race, it is Russia that has undermined the global security architecture.\u201d Donald Trump announced Friday that the US would formally withdraw in six months, and is immediately suspending participation in the treaty. In his statement, Trump warned that unless Russia destroyed its missile by August: \u201cWe will move forward with developing our own military response options and will work with Nato and our other allies and partners to deny Russia any military advantage from its unlawful conduct.\u201d New York Times publisher A. G. Sulzberger discussed Donald Trump\u2019s anti-press rhetoric in an Oval Office meeting with the president, where Trump was also interviewed by two Times reporters. In excerpts released today, Sulzberger asked Trump if he\u2019s aware that his rhetoric has had global consequences, emboldening authoritarians to crack down on journalists. \u201cI do notice that people are declaring more and more fake news, where they go \u201cfake news.\u201d I even see it in other countries. I don\u2019t necessarily attribute that to me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think I can attribute the term to me. I think I was the one that started using it, I would say. But I do see that.\u201d Trump goes on to complain more about how he is covered by the US press, while Sulzberger tells him that every US president felt has felt their coverage was harsh. \u201cI came from Jamaica, Queens, Jamaica Estates and I became president of the United States. I\u2019m sort of entitled to a great story from my \u2014 just one \u2014 from my newspaper,\u201d Trump said. Read the full exchange here. US military intervention in Venezuela is not imminent, National Security Adviser John Bolton said Friday. \u201cNo,\u201d Bolton said when asked by conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt if the US, Brazil or Colombia are about to intervene, the Hill reported. \u201cThe president said all options are on the table. But our objective is a peaceful transfer of power,\u201d Bolton said. Speculation about military intervention was sparked when Bolton was photographed holding a notepad saying, \u201c5,000 troops to Colombia.\u201d Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and his wife have donated $500,000 to a legal fund paying the bill for current and former Donald Trump aides ensnared in the Russia investigation, CNN reports. The fund, called the Patriot Legal Expenses Fund Trust, was set up last year to collect donations for legal defense. It has not disclosed whose legal bills it is paying, but they do not include Trump\u2019s personal legal bills. The Adelsons\u2019 donation is the biggest to the fund so far. Cory Booker, who speaks decent Spanish, did one of his opening campaign interviews with Univision. \u201cI want to announce my candidacy for president of the United States,\u201d he said in Spanish. \u201cWe have a bad situation in our country. American citizens have lost faith in our country,\u201d he went on. \u201cI want to change this. I have faith in our power when we work together...And I have faith that together we are going to have more success in our country.\u201d The host noted that for the first time in history, the Latino electorate would be larger than the African American electorate, and asked Booker what concrete promises he could make to Hispanic voters. He noted that Latino voters had helped him get elected mayor of Newark and re-stated his campaign themes of unity. \u201cI\u2019m going to work hard with the Latino community,\u201d he said. He declined to identify his chief rival in the Democratic field, saying he would focus on presenting his platform. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious my Spanish isn\u2019t perfect but I want to speak directly with the people,\u201d Booker said. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy has thrown his support behind home state senator Cory Booker for president. Senator Cory Booker, joined by his mom Carolyn, signed paperwork formally declaring his candidacy for president. His adviser Matt Klapper posted video of the moment. \u201cThe paperwork is signed. I am official,\u201d Booker said. It\u2019s looking like Booker\u2019s mom will play a visible role in her single son\u2019s campaign, according to Yahoo News. Senate intelligence committee investigators have learned who Donald Trump Jr. was talking to in three phone calls with blocked numbers just before and after an infamous Trump Tower meeting in June 2016, ABC News reports. The calls were between Trump Jr. and two family friends, NASCAR CEO Brian France and real estate developer Howard Lorber, sources told ABC. Trump Jr.\u2019s phone calls with blocked numbers have fueled speculation over whether he told his father about the meeting at Trump Tower, where he and other top Trump aides met with a Russian lawyer who claimed she had dirt on his opponent Hillary Clinton. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand welcomes Cory Booker to the presidential race and says she\u2019ll be rooting for him - \u201cjust, you know, not TOO hard.\u201d Newly elected female state representatives in Massachusetts are being frequently mistaken for political aides at the State House, the Boston Globe reports. Rep. Tram Nguyen recounted an exchange with a lobbyist who couldn\u2019t seem to grasp she was an elected official. Nguyen told the Globe she was also stopped from entering a staff bathroom in the State House by someone who thought she was a tourist. \u201cI get it. I look much younger than I am,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cEveryone keeps telling me I will love it some day. But it has been a struggle to establish my authority.\u201d Rep. Maria Robinson, who like Nguyen is Asian-American, said she was mistaken for an aide nine times in a single day. \u201cI\u2019m brand new in the building, and people will learn,\u201d she said. Donald Trump made a number of false and misleading statements in his interview Thursday with the New York Times, according to a fact check by the newspaper. Trump said: \u201cYou look at the heroin and a lot of the other drugs, they come from \u2014 90 percent, more than 90 percent \u2014 from right across the southern border. And unlike what the Democrats say, they don\u2019t, you don\u2019t bring trucks of drugs through the checkpoints. You bring trucks of drugs by making a right 20 miles, and a left into the country.\u201d This is false. Most of the heroin entering the United States does come across the southern border, but most of it passes through ports of entry, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. About 90% of heroin seized was at ports of entry from Oct. 1, 2017, to Aug. 30, 2018, compared to 10% in areas between checkpoints. On tariffs, Trump said: \u201cWe have 25 percent now on $50 billion. And by the way, Peter, that\u2019s a lot of money pouring into our Treasury, you know. We never made 5 cents with China. We\u2019re getting right now 25 percent on $50 billion.\u201d This is also false, the Times found. It is American companies and consumers paying the tariffs, not the Chinese. It is also untrue that the Treasury Department never collected any revenue from tariffs on Chinese products before Trump\u2019s term. President George Washington signed the first tariffs applying to China in 1789. It is clear that Trump himself did not write this statement. It is formally worded with none of the president\u2019s verbal tics, and it is sharply critical of Russia. It leaves open the possibility that the INF treaty could be saved within the six months before US withdrawal takes effect. But it sets a high bar, requiring Russia to destroy \u201call of its violating missiles, launchers, and associated equipment\u201d. That has been Washington\u2019s position all along by the US negotiator Andrea Thompson. She has not been prepared to examine a compromise involving inspections of the suspect Russian missile and possible tweaks to limit its range. Trump claims that \u201cour NATO allies fully support us\u201d. That is not entirely true. The allies agree that Russia is violating the INF treaty but do not agree with the US walking out of the treaty, which they believe still restrains Russian freedom of action in deploying missiles. Western European countries are fearful this will lead to a new arms race on European soil, a rerun of the tense 1980\u2019s. Some Eastern European countries meanwhile would host new US medium-range missiles as a guarantee that the US would come to their defence. Trump says his administration remains \u201ccommitted to effective arms control\u201d but neither he nor Mike Pompeo addressed the question of extending the New Start treaty, the last arms control agreement currently constraining the arsenals of the big nuclear weapons powers. It expires in 2021. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the United States is pulling out of a key nuclear treaty, according to CNN. Here\u2019s a statement from Donald Trump explaining the decision, via Bloomberg News: The treaty has been a centerpiece of superpower arms control since the Cold War and some analysts worry its demise could fuel a new arms race, according to the Associated Press. More from AP: An American withdrawal, which has been expected for months, would follow years of unresolved dispute over Russian compliance with the pact, known as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty. It was the first arms control measure to ban an entire class of weapons: ground-launched cruise missiles with a range between 500 kilometers (310 miles) and 5,500 kilometers (3,400 miles). Russia denies that it has been in violation. U.S. officials also have expressed worry that China, which is not party to the 1987 treaty, is gaining a significant military advantage in Asia by deploying large numbers of missiles with ranges beyond the treaty\u2019s limit. Leaving the INF treaty would allow the Trump administration to counter the Chinese, but it\u2019s unclear how it would do that. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in early December that Washington would give Moscow 60 days to return to compliance before it gave formal notice of withdrawal, with actual withdrawal taking place six months later. The 60-day deadline expires on Saturday, and the administration is expected to say as early as Friday that efforts to work out a compliance deal have failed and that it would suspend its compliance with the treaty\u2019s terms. The US jobs market has now added jobs for a record 100 months in a row, shaking off last month\u2019s government shutdown to add 304,000 jobs in January, according to the latest jobs report released Friday. But the unemployment rate ticked up slightly in January, to 4%. The current streak of job creation began in October 2010, and is now more than twice as long as the previous record, a 48-month run that ended in 1990. In other happenings today, Donald Trump is holding a late morning meeting to discuss fighting human trafficking on the southern border, and then will depart at 4pm for his Mar a Lago club in Florida. Roger Stone, the president\u2019s close associate who was indicted last week, is due back in court this afternoon. The Trump administration is expected to announce that it is withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty, according to the Associated Press. In Cory Booker\u2019s first radio interview after announcing his run for president, he called for the legalization of marijuana, according to the New York Times. \u201cIt means changing our drug laws. Ending prohibition against marijuana,\u201d he said. Senator Cory Booker has announced several key staff members for his presidential bid. Here\u2019s the list, via Yahoo News. New Jersey Senator Cory Booker is running for president in 2020, he announced Friday. The Democrat said he is jumping into the race in a morning email to supporters. \u201cRight now, Americans\u2019 faith is being shaken. Folks worry that what is tearing us apart is stronger than that which holds us together,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m running for president to change that. I am running for president because I don\u2019t believe that.\u201d Booker, who is black and first rose to prominence as the mayor of Newark, invoked the civil rights movement, recalling how his parents tried to move into a neighborhood with good public schools when he is a baby, but realtors would not sell to them because of their race. White volunteer lawyers stepped in to help them fight. \u201cLike all of us, I know I can never pay back my blessings, but we can, we must, pay them forward \u2013 with service and leadership and the same defiant love that is the true soul of this nation,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s why I am running for president of the United States.\u201d The New Jersey senator joins an already crowded field that includes Senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Kirsten Gillibrand, former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Reps. John Delaney and Tulsi Gabbard, and South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg. It is expected to continue to grow. Booker planned to give his first three interviews Friday morning to national radio shows with black or Latino hosts, and then to appear on ABC\u2019s The View with his mother in the audience, according to the New York Times.",

Despite certain illnesses virtually being eradicated in the 1950s, hospital attendances for some \u201cVictorian diseases\u201d have risen by 52% since 2010-11, an increase of over 3,000 admissions a year. The rise has been put down to sustained cuts to local authority public health budgets, which experts say have resulted in the services that protect against illness being scaled back. Helen Donovan, the Royal College of Nursing\u2019s professional lead for public health, said the findings were concerning. \u201cThe government should accept its responsibility for failing the most vulnerable in our society and commit to investing properly in vital public health services,\u201d she said. Hospital visits for scarlet fever \u2013 a leading cause of infant deaths in the early 20th century \u2013 for example, rose from 429 in 2010-11 to 1,321 in 2017-18. Although it was virtually wiped out in the 1950s following a nationwide vaccination programme, admissions with a primary diagnosis of whooping cough increased by 59%. Malnutrition numbers went up from 531 to 819 over the same time scale and gout numbers rose from 4,935 to 6,824, an increase of 38%. The research, conducted by the Labour party, was verified by the House of Commons library. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health and social care secretary, said: \u201cDickensian diseases on the rise in Tory Britain today. Isn\u2019t it shameful and as socialists we must respond.\u201d He added: \u201cThe damning truth is austerity is making our society sicker. It means the poor die younger. Since 2010, while food banks scatter across the land admission to hospital for malnutrition have increased by 54%. 2,539 people were diagnosed with tuberculosis last year.\u201d Donovan said: \u201cIt\u2019s very concerning that these conditions, associated with a bygone era, seem to be on the resurgence. There are many reasons behind this but one thing that cannot be ignored is the effect of sustained cuts to local authority public health budgets which have caused the services that screen, prevent and protect against illness, and promote good hygiene to be scaled back.\u201d It comes as Labour announces the goal for life expectancy and healthy life expectancy to match the best of Britain\u2019s international peers by 2030. Ashworth said: \u201cWe are facing a national emergency as widening health inequalities blight the land. Not only have advances in life expectancy begun to stall for the first time in a hundred years, it\u2019s even going backwards amongst some of the poorest communities.\u201d A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re committed to giving everyone five extra years of healthy, independent life by 2035 and reducing the gap between the rich and poor. We\u2019ve already made progress, with cancer survival at a record high and smoking rates at an all-time low. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to ensuring everyone gets the same great healthcare no matter where they live, which is why our long term plan for the NHS puts tackling health inequalities at its heart.\u201d",

Lostintranslation would still be winless over fences if that race had not fallen in his lap at the last moment, so the way looks clear for the strong-finishing Vinndication to keep up his unbeaten run. 2.55 Lingfield It looks significant that Frankie Dettori, rarely sighted in Britain at this time of year, takes the mount on the classy Wissahickon. 3.00 Sandown Being raised a full stone in the weights is not to be taken lightly but Casko D\u2019Airy earned all that and perhaps more with his Ascot success before Christmas. That was his handicap debut and there should be plenty more to come. He represents Paul Nicholls, who won this last year with a horse now making his way in quality novice chases. Folsom Blue did best of those to hug the inner in that race and may go well again. 3.35 Sandown The in-form Venetia Williams could strike here with Belami Des Pictons, who is still young enough to resume the progress over fences he was showing in 2017. 3.45 Leopardstown Joseph O\u2019Brien\u2019s Le Richebourg looked a star in the making when scoring around here over Christmas. He had a few of these behind him that day and the form should stand up. Mark Walsh will want to keep tabs on the pacey Knocknanuss, however.",
