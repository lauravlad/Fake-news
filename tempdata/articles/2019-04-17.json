      "bodyText": "Theresa May could put off the Queen\u2019s speech until later this year, with government sources saying there were no immediate plans to bring one forward while parliament had not yet approved a Brexit deal. May had been widely expected to schedule a Queen\u2019s speech setting out the government\u2019s legislative agenda within weeks, because she announced a two-year parliamentary session in mid-June 2017. However, some within the government believe May is prepared to ignore demands for a programme of new laws, even though parliament has run out of business to discuss apart from Brexit legislation, which is currently stalled. A Downing Street source said it would not be fair to say the Queen\u2019s speech was being delayed, because no official date had been set for one. \u201cThere\u2019s no obligation to have one at a fixed point and there\u2019s no immediate plans to bring forward a Queen\u2019s speech,\u201d the source said. There is usually one Queen\u2019s speech each year, and it has taken place in May or June in recent years, but Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, announced a two-year session after the last election in order to \u201cbuild the broadest possible consensus for our Brexit plans\u201d. There are several reasons why May might shy away from a Queen\u2019s speech, but the most pressing is that she may not have the votes to get it through parliament given the opposition to her Brexit deal among hardline Conservative Eurosceptics, the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and opposition parties. Bringing the speech forward could give MPs the opportunity to show there is no confidence in the government by voting it down, especially if parliament voted against the EU withdrawal bill and the Queen\u2019s speech was used to introduce it again. May only has a majority with the backing of the DUP, but relations are weak following the party\u2019s refusal to back her withdrawal bill. Her confidence and supply agreement with the DUP lasts as long as a parliamentary session, meaning it would be under no obligation to support a new Queen\u2019s speech unless that had been renegotiated \u2013 possibly requiring more money. However, there are downsides to putting off a Queen\u2019s speech, which could mean May ultimately concluding that one is necessary. One concern in No 10 is that if its EU withdrawal bill was voted down, it would have to prorogue parliament and have a Queen\u2019s speech in order to bring it back again. Other factors include the government having all but run out of legislation for parliament to debate other than bills connected to Brexit, and the likelihood of a furious reaction from MPs, including those in the DUP. Chris Bryant, the Labour MP and former shadow leader of the Commons, said a refusal to bring forward a Queen\u2019s speech would be a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in a parliamentary session if we\u2019ve not got anything to do. I never knew the real meaning of the word doldrums until this parliament,\u201d he said. Nigel Dodds, the DUP Westminster leader, said last week: \u201cThere is some talk around of extending this session beyond two years.

Threadneedle Street has said as much as $20tn (\u00a315.3tn) of assets could be wiped out by climate change if it is not effectively addressed.</p> \n<p>The open letter from Carney and De Galhau accompanies the launch of a report from the <a href=\"https://www.banque-france.fr/en/financial-stability/international-role/network-greening-financial-system\">Network for Greening the Financial System</a> (NGFS), an international group of central banks and financial regulators, outlining the steps necessary for financiers to tackle climate change.</p> \n<p>Global warming has typically been of secondary concern to central bankers since the 2008 financial crisis, as they grappled with the immediate threat of banking failures. However, there is growing recognition that action is needed to fight the risks it poses.</p> \n<p>Although they have received praise for advancing the debate about climate change, Carney, central bankers and financiers have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/15/banks-will-not-be-forced-to-reveal-climate-change-risks-they-face\">criticised for expecting the banking industry to reform itself</a> without tougher regulation being introduced.</p> \n<p>Frank van Lerven, a senior economist at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, said: \u201cCentral banks across the world, and in the UK, have done a very good job of identifying the problem.

They said: \u201cAs financial policymakers and prudential supervisors we cannot ignore the obvious physical risks before our eyes. Climate change is a global problem, which requires global solutions, in which the whole financial sector has a central role to play.\u201d The warning comes as concern over the impact of climate change and the lack of urgent action is increasing, reflected in the Extinction Rebellion protests and schoolchildren\u2019s strikes across the world. The heads of two of the world\u2019s most influential central banks urged other financial regulators around the world to carry out climate change stress tests to spot any risks in the system, while also calling for more collaboration between nations on the issue. They warned that a \u201cmassive reallocation of capital\u201d was necessary to prevent global warming above the 2\u00b0C maximum target set by the Paris climate agreement, with the banking system required to play a pivotal role. \u201cIf some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,\u201d Carney and De Galhau said. Climate change poses significant risks to banks and insurers from rising instances of catastrophic weather-related events, such as heatwaves, droughts and floods, which could land them with significant losses. There are also risks for financial firms as governments accept the need to tackle climate change because banks that have lent to companies reliant on burning fossil fuels run the risk of steep financial losses. Carney has previously warned that plunging sales of diesel cars, due to new vehicle emissions tests and changes in the tax system, which have had knock-on effects for manufacturers and the wider economy, are an example of this in action. Banks could find they have stranded assets that turn out to be worthless if they are reliant on burning fossil fuels. Threadneedle Street has said as much as $20tn (\u00a315.3tn) of assets could be wiped out by climate change if it is not effectively addressed. The open letter from Carney and De Galhau accompanies the launch of a report from the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), an international group of central banks and financial regulators, outlining the steps necessary for financiers to tackle climate change. Global warming has typically been of secondary concern to central bankers since the 2008 financial crisis, as they grappled with the immediate threat of banking failures. However, there is growing recognition that action is needed to fight the risks it poses. Although they have received praise for advancing the debate about climate change, Carney, central bankers and financiers have been criticised for expecting the banking industry to reform itself without tougher regulation being introduced. Frank van Lerven, a senior economist at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, said: \u201cCentral banks across the world, and in the UK, have done a very good job of identifying the problem. The question is whether they have the right balance between being thought leaders on this issue and identifying problems and taking action.\u201d",

With little more than a month left until Brexit day, longtime backers of a second referendum were ramping up the pressure on the leadership.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne of the things people were thinking was that because the splitters \u2013 the evacuees \u2013 were making a point about Brexit, we should get our position out there,\u201d recalled one shadow minister who was present. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want a lot of people to start resigning because of that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Starmer certainly felt it was time for a shift and, in the preceding days, he had won the support of McDonnell, who was concerned about keeping onboard hundreds of thousands of overwhelmingly remain-backing activists who had surged into Labour to support Corbyn\u2019s leadership.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e8b856812087345cfbab6ee34cf507a0dc4d4da\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e8b856812087345cfbab6ee34cf507a0dc4d4da/0_198_3732_2240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labour\u2019s stance on Brexit under Corbyn has pitched old allies against each other and opened new fissures within the party.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The pair had latched on to an amendment being drafted by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson aimed at persuading the prime minister to submit her Brexit deal to a \u201cconfirmatory vote\u201d by the public in exchange for support for it in the Commons.</p> \n<p>Some Labour strategists were dismissive of the idea, regarding it as a backbench boondoggle cooked up to tempt the desperate Tories \u2013 one that risked tying Labour in knots by forcing it to tacitly support a Brexit deal the leadership had vehemently rejected. And they were confident that a majority of the wider shadow cabinet, not to mention a majority of MPs. were against a referendum.</p> \n<p>But they had reckoned without the shift in political weather that came with the departure of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/the-independent-group\">Tigs</a>, and the persuasive powers of the likes of Starmer and Abbott, who also felt Labour needed to be able to say to its voters that there were certain circumstances in which the party would back a referendum \u2013 and if not now, when?</p> \n<p>As the fraught meeting wore on, Gardiner and Chakrabarti, both of whom had previously been cautious about a referendum, switched sides. In the end, Trickett was comprehensively outnumbered.</p> \n<p> Several sources at the meeting have told the Guardian that the decision appeared to come as a shock to party officials in the room, including Corbyn\u2019s top adviser Seumas Milne. \u201cSeumas looked shaken, to be honest,\u201d said one.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b23fbc6af0c1cb893b5a3c385647a75215b7fde0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b23fbc6af0c1cb893b5a3c385647a75215b7fde0/0_102_4239_2543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chuka Umunna, right, and fellow Independent Group MPs in February\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chuka Umunna, right, and fellow Independent Group MPs in February.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Starmer stayed to sign off a painstakingly drafted press release announcing that the party would now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/25/labour-to-back-moves-for-second-brexit-referendum\">back a public vote</a> to prevent \u201ca damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country\u201d.</p> \n<p>It was a significant moment. Labour\u2019s stance on Brexit has evolved through a hard-fought political tug of war, pitching old allies against each other and opening new fissures that will cast a long shadow over the Corbyn project. The struggle is still being played out in the background as Corbyn and key frontbenchers engage in unprecedented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/03/jeremy-corbyn-under-pressure-to-back-public-vote-on-brexit-deal\">negotiations with the government</a>.</p> \n<p>Through conversations with more than a dozen senior Labour decision makers, it is possible to build a picture of an extraordinary few months that have shaped the future of the party and, perhaps, of the country.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"90b7f964-34d7-4100-9b54-1c3c938a84aa\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>August 2016</b></p>\n    <p>Making explicit the position he held since the Brexit vote, Jeremy Corbyn says Labour will respect the result of the referendum.&nbsp;\"I think we've had a referendum, a decision has been made, you have to respect the decision people made.\"</p>\n    <p><b>June 2017</b></p>\n    <p>Wary of upsetting voters in leave areas, Labour's manifesto for the 2017 general election declares: \"Labour accepts the referendum result and a Labour government will put the national interest first.\"&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>September 2018</b></p>\n    <p>Over five gruelling hours, Labour's internal contradictions over Brexit are distilled into a conference composite motion that makes&nbsp;the party's priority to seek a general election but, failing that, says a referendum should not be ruled out.</p>\n    <p><b>February 2019</b></p>\n    <p>Chuka Umunna and remain MPs from both Labour and the Conservatives quit to form the Independent Group, citing Brexit as a major motivating factor.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>March 2019</b></p>\n    <p>Labour backs attempts by backbenchers to keep the option of a public vote on the table to stop a no-deal Brexit or May's deal.

He won himself a warm round of applause.</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s cadre of bright young advisers immediately grasped the significance of the moment and at one conference party they launched into a refrain of \u201cAll options on the ta-ble\u201d, to the tune of the White Stripes\u2019 Seven Nation Army, to which a year earlier at Glastonbury the crowd had roared \u201cOh Jeremy Corbyn\u201d.</p> \n<p>Corbyn\u2019s tone in his end-of-conference speech was rather different. While he praised Starmer, he made a striking promise to May that, if she would compromise, Labour would be willing to vote for a \u201csensible\u201d Brexit. He also set out what that might mean: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/06/corbyn-lays-out-labours-terms-for-backing-may-on-brexit\">a customs union</a> and better protections for workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards.</p> \n<p>These two contending visions \u2013 a Labour Brexit, and a public vote to reverse the 2016 referendum result and stop Brexit \u2013 have continued to shape the debate at the highest levels of the party ever since.</p> \n<p>For many of its MPs and the overwhelming majority of members, Labour\u2019s natural home is in what Corbyn\u2019s team waspishly call Remoania. But the Labour leader is a longtime Eurosceptic and he made clear in the early hours of the morning after the Brexit vote that his party would honour the result. </p> \n<p>There are strategic imperatives behind the Labour leadership\u2019s hesitation about a referendum, too. A cautionary presentation to the shadow cabinet recently suggested that, as a result of the shift towards supporting a fresh poll, Labour would suffer in May\u2019s local elections, many of which are being held in leave-leaning areas. Projecting the same analysis on to a national scale suggested the party could struggle to win a majority at a future general election.</p> \n<p>More broadly, many of those around Corbyn believe their party would benefit if the political debate moved on beyond Brexit, to issues on which Labour is less divided. \u201cWe want to get to where it\u2019s the many versus the few, and that\u2019s what politics is again \u2013 but we know that to get there we need to keep the coalition together,\u201d said one senior party strategist.</p> \n<p>The backlash against the party\u2019s qualified support for a referendum began almost immediately, at the next shadow cabinet meeting, with Trickett\u2019s objections amplified by several others including Ian Lavery, Richard Burgon and Rebecca Long-Bailey, who felt they had been bounced. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d30f8d9468c50022feb393cfc0aa296da6bc3d6a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d30f8d9468c50022feb393cfc0aa296da6bc3d6a/0_120_4020_2412/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Put it to the People march\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hundreds of thousands of people attended a Put it to the People march in London last month.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Marriott/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Shadow ministers on both sides of the debate note wryly that attendance at decision-making meetings expands and contracts, apparently at the whim of the leader\u2019s office. At the regular Tuesday shadow cabinet meetings, where members are now asked to hand in their mobile phones after a spate of leaks, Brexit discussions have been often perfunctory but occasionally explosive.</p> \n<p>One one occasion, Lavery responded angrily to a warning from Abbott that Labour should not give ground to arguments against migration, accusing her of calling him \u201cgammon\u201d \u2013 the derisive phrase used by lefty activists to describe middle-aged white men with reactionary views.</p> \n<p>Advocates of a referendum frequently complain that advances they believe they have made tend to be spun away \u2013 the most obvious example being Corbyn\u2019s February letter to the prime minister setting out his conditions for supporting a Brexit deal.</p> \n<p>Starmer drafted the letter, which fleshed out Labour\u2019s policy, and quietly downgraded some aspects of it, including the party\u2019s rejection of state aid rules, in a process insiders dubbed \u201cde-unicorning\u201d.</p> \n<p>An early draft included a reference to a public vote, but this was removed in an editing process involving Milne. Starmer signed off the changes on the understanding that, in publicising the letter, the leader\u2019s office would make reference to a referendum \u2013 but that didn\u2019t happen.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that Seumas is the one that unpicks it every time,\u201d said one shadow minister. However, allies of Milne described the idea that he or any other individual was subverting Labour\u2019s policy as \u201cconspiratorial nonsense\u201d.</p> \n<p>Whatever the leadership\u2019s reservations, from the moment the composite motion was unanimously agreed, Starmer felt himself to be its solemn guardian and, as the months ground on, it gave him a weapon to nudge and harry the leadership, urging them to \u201cmove through the gears\u201d, as he called it.</p> \n<p>Their chosen vehicle became an amendment originally conceived by the backbenchers Kyle and Wilson in an attempt to win over the Tories to the idea of a \u201cconfirmatory\u201d referendum on May\u2019s deal.</p> \n<p>Kyle told May at prime minister\u2019s questions that he was willing to lend support to her deal if she would agree to submit it to a confirmatory vote in a process that echoed the ratification of the Good Friday agreement. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f393a48e606f4b9e7cbcd51b25b30a2ec59d85d3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f393a48e606f4b9e7cbcd51b25b30a2ec59d85d3/202_36_1577_946/1000.jpg\" alt=\"House of Commons Brexit vote 1 April\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brexit divisions have cut across the left-right divide that has traditionally defined who is on or offside in the Corbyn project.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Even after the announcement on 25 February that Labour would support a Kyle-Wilson-type amendment, Labour avoided parading its divisions in public, as People\u2019s Vote campaigners held back from forcing the issue, judging that the later they tested parliamentary support for the idea, the more votes it would win.</p> \n<p>But when the Independent Group\u2019s Sarah Wollaston put down an amendment on 14 March to the government\u2019s motion calling for an article 50 extension, some of Labour\u2019s divisions began to be flushed out into the open. </p> \n<p>When backbenchers then seized control of the parliamentary timetable to hold \u201cindicative votes\u201d on alternatives to the prime minister\u2019s deal, those Labour tensions exploded. </p> \n<p>On the long day of the first round of voting, which ultimately yielded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/theresa-may-to-resign-before-next-phase-of-brexit\">no majority for anything</a>, there were a series of flare-ups, not least a furious stand-up row between the People\u2019s Vote campaigner Stephen Doughty and the Manchester Central MP, Lucy Powell, the informal whip for \u201ccommon market 2.0\u201d, a cross-party backbench plan for a soft Brexit. </p> \n<p>Before the votes, Corbyn dispatched a letter to all Labour MPs insisting he was only supporting the pro-referendum motion to \u201ckeep the option of a public vote on the table in order to stop a disastrous no deal or May\u2019s unacceptable deal\u201d. </p> \n<p>Three members of the shadow cabinet \u2013 Trickett, Lavery and Andrew Gwynne \u2013 ignored the whip and abstained on the referendum motion. Exasperated colleagues waited in vain for them to be disciplined, let alone sacked. </p> \n<p>Another 27 Labour MPs voted against the motion, including an informal grouping of backbenchers from leave seats, among them Gareth Snell and Caroline Flint, who have been resolutely against a referendum for many months, believing they would face a ferocious backlash from constituents.</p> \n<p>Other Labour MPs also fret about the potential impact of a referendum on British political debate after more than two years of fruitless wrangling in Westminster. Stephen Kinnock, who has worked with Powell\u2019s common market group, said: \u201cWe could potentially be tipping over into a culture war.\u201d </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ef4ac79e7bdfdd30a4b2d4f2cfd5fbc1bb0a468\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ef4ac79e7bdfdd30a4b2d4f2cfd5fbc1bb0a468/685_0_3546_2127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey leaving the Cabinet Office after cross-party talks on Brexit\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey leaving the Cabinet Office after cross-party talks on Brexit this month.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Running throughout the debate in the leader\u2019s office and among leftwingers in the shadow cabinet was a dark suspicion that the Brexit issue was being used as a wedge to separate Corbyn from the Labour membership and perhaps open the way for someone else to take over. The deputy leader, Tom Watson, as the left\u2019s favourite bogeyman, is often mentioned.</p> \n<p>But Brexit divisions cut across the left-right divide that has traditionally defined who is on or offside in the Corbyn project. Perhaps even more concerning for the leadership is a group of leftwing MPs \u2013 including Clive Lewis, Lloyd Russell-Moyle and Rachel Maskell \u2013 who are increasingly finding their voice.</p> \n<p>Maskell and Lewis set up Love Socialism, Hate Brexit, a Labour grouping backed by the anti-Brexit campaign Best for Britain, which had its own \u201cleft block\u201d march alongside the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/23/put-it-to-the-people-march-against-brexit-london-revoke-remain-reform\">Put it to the People rally</a> last month. Lewis warned of the risk that if Labour was regarded as complicit, \u201cthen for many years to come it will be held responsible by many for every job loss, every poor economic indicator, every nurse, teacher or new medicine we\u2019re told we just can\u2019t afford.\u201d</p> \n<p>So alarmed were the leadership about the risks of division and ill-discipline being displayed afresh in a second round of indicative votes that Corbyn\u2019s political director, Amy Jackson, was dispatched to urge Kyle to pull his troublesome motion.</p> \n<p>He flatly refused, and it was redrafted and resubmitted for the 1 April votes, again in Margaret Beckett\u2019s name. \u201cKyle-Wilson became a cipher for people who wanted our policy to be full \u2018People\u2019s Vote\u2019 \u2013 it became totemic,\u201d one Labour strategist complained.</p> \n<p>In the event, it fell just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/01/brexit-what-are-the-indicative-votes-mps-will-vote-on\">12 votes short</a> of a majority, as People\u2019s Vote supporters threw everything they had at building support for it, begging, cajoling and persuading their colleagues. </p> \n<p>The near-miss gave heart to those, including Starmer, who have suggested any deal now reached \u2013 including in the talks between Labour and the government \u2013 must be submitted to the public for approval.</p> \n<p>Watson has taken that position publicly, and a leaked letter from Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, made clear she too felt any deal would have to be put to the public.</p> \n<p>But the shadow cabinet as a whole remains far from won over to that view. Many would be satisfied with the offer \u2013 mooted in the negotiations with the government \u2013 of a free vote on a referendum, separate from any new meaningful vote on a cross-party deal.</p> \n<p>Senior Corbyn allies stress that if May signed up to a customs union and the stronger protections for workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards they have demanded, it would no longer be the \u201cdamaging Tory Brexit\u201d that their support for a referendum was designed to avert.</p> \n<p>But anti-Brexit campaigners on the backbenches, from left and right, are putting their faith in Starmer as their man in the room. \u201cKeir won\u2019t let us down,\u201d said one MP.</p> \n<p>Labour is serious about the talks, and Corbyn believes the public would look more kindly on politicians willing to compromise than on ideologues. \u201cThe country wants there to be an agreement and an outcome; I don\u2019t think there is any doubt about that,\u201d his spokesman said last week. </p> \n<p>Anand Menon, the director of the thinktank Britain in a Changing Europe, said the constructive ambiguity of playing to the audiences of both leavers and remainers, was never going to hold for ever.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think Jeremy\u2019s actually played it really, really well, and the 2017 election result was the proof of that,\u201d Menon said. \u201cBut I think it was always going to get hard come decision time. He\u2019s just been unlucky, in the sense that decision time has lasted six months rather than a week.\u201d</p> \n<p>However grave Labour\u2019s challenges, the prime minister\u2019s appear worse. As one shadow cabinet member put it: \u201cWe still think there\u2019s a bit of road left. The Tories could break before we do.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Tomorrow: Rory Carroll and Lisa O\u2019Carroll on Brexit and the Irish border.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "On a quiet Monday at the end of February, the most influential voices in Labour\u2019s Brexit policymaking gathered in one of the suite of riverside rooms in Westminster allotted to Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the opposition for a three-hour meeting that could have a profound influence on the party\u2019s future. Seven days earlier, Chuka Umunna and his band of splitters had summoned journalists to a press conference to announce they were leaving the party, blaming Brexit policy as well as a failure to tackle antisemitism. In attendance were the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, and Corbyn\u2019s wily old ally John McDonnell, along with handpicked Corbyn supporters including Diane Abbott and Jon Trickett, plus the shadow international trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, and the Labour peer Shami Chakrabarti. Later that day, Corbyn was due to address Labour backbenchers for the first time since the breakaway. With little more than a month left until Brexit day, longtime backers of a second referendum were ramping up the pressure on the leadership. \u201cOne of the things people were thinking was that because the splitters \u2013 the evacuees \u2013 were making a point about Brexit, we should get our position out there,\u201d recalled one shadow minister who was present. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want a lot of people to start resigning because of that.\u201d Starmer certainly felt it was time for a shift and, in the preceding days, he had won the support of McDonnell, who was concerned about keeping onboard hundreds of thousands of overwhelmingly remain-backing activists who had surged into Labour to support Corbyn\u2019s leadership. The pair had latched on to an amendment being drafted by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson aimed at persuading the prime minister to submit her Brexit deal to a \u201cconfirmatory vote\u201d by the public in exchange for support for it in the Commons. Some Labour strategists were dismissive of the idea, regarding it as a backbench boondoggle cooked up to tempt the desperate Tories \u2013 one that risked tying Labour in knots by forcing it to tacitly support a Brexit deal the leadership had vehemently rejected. And they were confident that a majority of the wider shadow cabinet, not to mention a majority of MPs. were against a referendum. But they had reckoned without the shift in political weather that came with the departure of the Tigs, and the persuasive powers of the likes of Starmer and Abbott, who also felt Labour needed to be able to say to its voters that there were certain circumstances in which the party would back a referendum \u2013 and if not now, when? As the fraught meeting wore on, Gardiner and Chakrabarti, both of whom had previously been cautious about a referendum, switched sides. In the end, Trickett was comprehensively outnumbered. Several sources at the meeting have told the Guardian that the decision appeared to come as a shock to party officials in the room, including Corbyn\u2019s top adviser Seumas Milne. \u201cSeumas looked shaken, to be honest,\u201d said one. Starmer stayed to sign off a painstakingly drafted press release announcing that the party would now back a public vote to prevent \u201ca damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country\u201d. It was a significant moment. Labour\u2019s stance on Brexit has evolved through a hard-fought political tug of war, pitching old allies against each other and opening new fissures that will cast a long shadow over the Corbyn project. The struggle is still being played out in the background as Corbyn and key frontbenchers engage in unprecedented negotiations with the government. Through conversations with more than a dozen senior Labour decision makers, it is possible to build a picture of an extraordinary few months that have shaped the future of the party and, perhaps, of the country. For Starmer, the announcement of Labour\u2019s qualified support for a \u201cpublic vote\u201d was a staging post on a journey that had begun more than five months earlier when he chaired a late-night meeting with 300 party delegates that drafted a two-page \u201ccomposite motion\u201d setting Labour\u2019s Brexit policy. The meat of the motion said Labour would vote against Theresa May\u2019s deal and push for a general election, but that \u201cif we cannot get a general election Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote.\u201d Starmer then went further, deftly dropping into his conference speech the view that if another referendum were held, remain would have to be an option on the ballot paper. He won himself a warm round of applause. Labour\u2019s cadre of bright young advisers immediately grasped the significance of the moment and at one conference party they launched into a refrain of \u201cAll options on the ta-ble\u201d, to the tune of the White Stripes\u2019 Seven Nation Army, to which a year earlier at Glastonbury the crowd had roared \u201cOh Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. Corbyn\u2019s tone in his end-of-conference speech was rather different. While he praised Starmer, he made a striking promise to May that, if she would compromise, Labour would be willing to vote for a \u201csensible\u201d Brexit. He also set out what that might mean: a customs union and better protections for workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards. These two contending visions \u2013 a Labour Brexit, and a public vote to reverse the 2016 referendum result and stop Brexit \u2013 have continued to shape the debate at the highest levels of the party ever since. For many of its MPs and the overwhelming majority of members, Labour\u2019s natural home is in what Corbyn\u2019s team waspishly call Remoania. But the Labour leader is a longtime Eurosceptic and he made clear in the early hours of the morning after the Brexit vote that his party would honour the result. There are strategic imperatives behind the Labour leadership\u2019s hesitation about a referendum, too. A cautionary presentation to the shadow cabinet recently suggested that, as a result of the shift towards supporting a fresh poll, Labour would suffer in May\u2019s local elections, many of which are being held in leave-leaning areas. Projecting the same analysis on to a national scale suggested the party could struggle to win a majority at a future general election. More broadly, many of those around Corbyn believe their party would benefit if the political debate moved on beyond Brexit, to issues on which Labour is less divided. \u201cWe want to get to where it\u2019s the many versus the few, and that\u2019s what politics is again \u2013 but we know that to get there we need to keep the coalition together,\u201d said one senior party strategist. The backlash against the party\u2019s qualified support for a referendum began almost immediately, at the next shadow cabinet meeting, with Trickett\u2019s objections amplified by several others including Ian Lavery, Richard Burgon and Rebecca Long-Bailey, who felt they had been bounced. Shadow ministers on both sides of the debate note wryly that attendance at decision-making meetings expands and contracts, apparently at the whim of the leader\u2019s office. At the regular Tuesday shadow cabinet meetings, where members are now asked to hand in their mobile phones after a spate of leaks, Brexit discussions have been often perfunctory but occasionally explosive. One one occasion, Lavery responded angrily to a warning from Abbott that Labour should not give ground to arguments against migration, accusing her of calling him \u201cgammon\u201d \u2013 the derisive phrase used by lefty activists to describe middle-aged white men with reactionary views. Advocates of a referendum frequently complain that advances they believe they have made tend to be spun away \u2013 the most obvious example being Corbyn\u2019s February letter to the prime minister setting out his conditions for supporting a Brexit deal. Starmer drafted the letter, which fleshed out Labour\u2019s policy, and quietly downgraded some aspects of it, including the party\u2019s rejection of state aid rules, in a process insiders dubbed \u201cde-unicorning\u201d. An early draft included a reference to a public vote, but this was removed in an editing process involving Milne. Starmer signed off the changes on the understanding that, in publicising the letter, the leader\u2019s office would make reference to a referendum \u2013 but that didn\u2019t happen. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that Seumas is the one that unpicks it every time,\u201d said one shadow minister. However, allies of Milne described the idea that he or any other individual was subverting Labour\u2019s policy as \u201cconspiratorial nonsense\u201d. Whatever the leadership\u2019s reservations, from the moment the composite motion was unanimously agreed, Starmer felt himself to be its solemn guardian and, as the months ground on, it gave him a weapon to nudge and harry the leadership, urging them to \u201cmove through the gears\u201d, as he called it. Their chosen vehicle became an amendment originally conceived by the backbenchers Kyle and Wilson in an attempt to win over the Tories to the idea of a \u201cconfirmatory\u201d referendum on May\u2019s deal. Kyle told May at prime minister\u2019s questions that he was willing to lend support to her deal if she would agree to submit it to a confirmatory vote in a process that echoed the ratification of the Good Friday agreement. Even after the announcement on 25 February that Labour would support a Kyle-Wilson-type amendment, Labour avoided parading its divisions in public, as People\u2019s Vote campaigners held back from forcing the issue, judging that the later they tested parliamentary support for the idea, the more votes it would win. But when the Independent Group\u2019s Sarah Wollaston put down an amendment on 14 March to the government\u2019s motion calling for an article 50 extension, some of Labour\u2019s divisions began to be flushed out into the open. When backbenchers then seized control of the parliamentary timetable to hold \u201cindicative votes\u201d on alternatives to the prime minister\u2019s deal, those Labour tensions exploded. On the long day of the first round of voting, which ultimately yielded no majority for anything, there were a series of flare-ups, not least a furious stand-up row between the People\u2019s Vote campaigner Stephen Doughty and the Manchester Central MP, Lucy Powell, the informal whip for \u201ccommon market 2.0\u201d, a cross-party backbench plan for a soft Brexit. Before the votes, Corbyn dispatched a letter to all Labour MPs insisting he was only supporting the pro-referendum motion to \u201ckeep the option of a public vote on the table in order to stop a disastrous no deal or May\u2019s unacceptable deal\u201d. Three members of the shadow cabinet \u2013 Trickett, Lavery and Andrew Gwynne \u2013 ignored the whip and abstained on the referendum motion. Exasperated colleagues waited in vain for them to be disciplined, let alone sacked. Another 27 Labour MPs voted against the motion, including an informal grouping of backbenchers from leave seats, among them Gareth Snell and Caroline Flint, who have been resolutely against a referendum for many months, believing they would face a ferocious backlash from constituents. Other Labour MPs also fret about the potential impact of a referendum on British political debate after more than two years of fruitless wrangling in Westminster. Stephen Kinnock, who has worked with Powell\u2019s common market group, said: \u201cWe could potentially be tipping over into a culture war.\u201d Running throughout the debate in the leader\u2019s office and among leftwingers in the shadow cabinet was a dark suspicion that the Brexit issue was being used as a wedge to separate Corbyn from the Labour membership and perhaps open the way for someone else to take over. The deputy leader, Tom Watson, as the left\u2019s favourite bogeyman, is often mentioned. But Brexit divisions cut across the left-right divide that has traditionally defined who is on or offside in the Corbyn project. Perhaps even more concerning for the leadership is a group of leftwing MPs \u2013 including Clive Lewis, Lloyd Russell-Moyle and Rachel Maskell \u2013 who are increasingly finding their voice. Maskell and Lewis set up Love Socialism, Hate Brexit, a Labour grouping backed by the anti-Brexit campaign Best for Britain, which had its own \u201cleft block\u201d march alongside the Put it to the People rally last month. Lewis warned of the risk that if Labour was regarded as complicit, \u201cthen for many years to come it will be held responsible by many for every job loss, every poor economic indicator, every nurse, teacher or new medicine we\u2019re told we just can\u2019t afford.\u201d So alarmed were the leadership about the risks of division and ill-discipline being displayed afresh in a second round of indicative votes that Corbyn\u2019s political director, Amy Jackson, was dispatched to urge Kyle to pull his troublesome motion. He flatly refused, and it was redrafted and resubmitted for the 1 April votes, again in Margaret Beckett\u2019s name. \u201cKyle-Wilson became a cipher for people who wanted our policy to be full \u2018People\u2019s Vote\u2019 \u2013 it became totemic,\u201d one Labour strategist complained. In the event, it fell just 12 votes short of a majority, as People\u2019s Vote supporters threw everything they had at building support for it, begging, cajoling and persuading their colleagues. The near-miss gave heart to those, including Starmer, who have suggested any deal now reached \u2013 including in the talks between Labour and the government \u2013 must be submitted to the public for approval. Watson has taken that position publicly, and a leaked letter from Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, made clear she too felt any deal would have to be put to the public. But the shadow cabinet as a whole remains far from won over to that view. Many would be satisfied with the offer \u2013 mooted in the negotiations with the government \u2013 of a free vote on a referendum, separate from any new meaningful vote on a cross-party deal. Senior Corbyn allies stress that if May signed up to a customs union and the stronger protections for workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards they have demanded, it would no longer be the \u201cdamaging Tory Brexit\u201d that their support for a referendum was designed to avert. But anti-Brexit campaigners on the backbenches, from left and right, are putting their faith in Starmer as their man in the room. \u201cKeir won\u2019t let us down,\u201d said one MP. Labour is serious about the talks, and Corbyn believes the public would look more kindly on politicians willing to compromise than on ideologues. \u201cThe country wants there to be an agreement and an outcome; I don\u2019t think there is any doubt about that,\u201d his spokesman said last week. Anand Menon, the director of the thinktank Britain in a Changing Europe, said the constructive ambiguity of playing to the audiences of both leavers and remainers, was never going to hold for ever. \u201cI think Jeremy\u2019s actually played it really, really well, and the 2017 election result was the proof of that,\u201d Menon said. \u201cBut I think it was always going to get hard come decision time. He\u2019s just been unlucky, in the sense that decision time has lasted six months rather than a week.\u201d However grave Labour\u2019s challenges, the prime minister\u2019s appear worse. As one shadow cabinet member put it: \u201cWe still think there\u2019s a bit of road left. The Tories could break before we do.\u201d Tomorrow: Rory Carroll and Lisa O\u2019Carroll on Brexit and the Irish border.",
