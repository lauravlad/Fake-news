The former Tory, who is standing as an independent, has told Channel 4 News:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s going to take some time and it\u2019s simply not possible to do it on a timetable that says: \u2018We will leave the implementation period do or die at the end of next year\u2019.</p> \n   <p>My point is not really about the merits in general of Boris Johnson. It is about a policy which I think is going to be very damaging to the country.</p> \n   <p>I do think there is a failure to level with the British people that the idea that we\u2019re just going to kind of get Brexit done on 31 January and then we can move on to other things and no-one will hear about Brexit ever again \u2013 it will all be in our past \u2013 simply doesn\u2019t reflect the reality.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He added:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think the Conservative party is not being straight with the British public, that this is more complex, that if we want to get a good settlement with the European Union then we are going to have to take longer to negotiate a free trade agreement and you simply cannot reconcile the reality with the government\u2019s rhetoric.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Gauke said the party has \u201cchanged very rapidly\u201d in the last few months, adding that it should accommodate a range of views.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>But it is now taking a purity test if you like on Brexit.

Indeed, we\u2019d worked very hard and everybody knew we wanted to get it out before the election ... and we got the classification cleared so that we had worked with the intelligence agencies and the national security secretariat to ensure that it could be published.</p> \n   <p>And they were completely satisfied. So, the sign-off from the prime minister I would normally have expected to be an issue of routine, which would \u2013 generally speaking \u2013 take place in 10 days.

There was speculation that an explicit commitment by Boris Johnson to have a no-deal Brexit by the end of 2020 if the UK-EU trade deal could not be agreed by then might have been enough to win Farage around. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/13/general-election-johnson-re-launches-tory-campaign-as-labour-unveils-nhs-plan-live-news?page=with:block-5dcc38428f08aab51e1be737#block-5dcc38428f08aab51e1be737\">Farage hinted as much himself this afternoon. </a>Johnson has ruled out extending the Brexit transition beyond the end of 2020. But in interviews this morning his ally <strong>Michael Gove </strong>repeatedly insisted that there was no prospect of a no-deal Brexit at the end of next year. And, in the Q&amp;A after his speech, Johnson also declined various opportunities to talk up his willingness to countenance a no-deal Brexit, in language that might appeal to Farage. Instead he just urged the Brexit party to back the Tories to get Brexit done. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I just want to say about Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party. It is always a very difficult thing for any party leader to withdraw candidates from an election and I understand that.</p> \n   <p>But all I can say ... for the avoidance of doubt, to repeat my central message, there is only one way to ensure that we get Brexit done - get this thing finished, get us out, do a fantastic free-trade deal - and that is to vote for us and the Conservatives.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Having earlier said that it might be possible for him to vote Tory in the election, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/13/general-election-johnson-re-launches-tory-campaign-as-labour-unveils-nhs-plan-live-news?page=with:block-5dcc3ec28f08eeb483f16e54#block-5dcc3ec28f08eeb483f16e54\">Farage posted a tweet, at around the time Johnson\u2019s Q&amp;A was coming to an end, saying that this was now impossible.</a> This means the Tories are now set to face a Brexit party challenge in many or all of their target seats.</p> \n  <p>Johnson\u2019s unwillingness to harden up his Brexit stance probably tells little about the Brexit policy he would adopt if he won the election. It is more likely that he is worried that any further pivot towards Faragism would cost him more votes from remain-inclined Tories.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson has recast his opponents in the election as the \u201cSturgeon-Corbyn alliance\u201d.</strong> Yesterday Jeremy Corbyn argued that the Brexit party decision to stand down in some seats meant Labour was fighting what amounted to a Trump/Farage/Johnson alliance. Today Johnson hit back by arguing that he too was up against an alliance. In his speech he argued:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One thing is clear: the Sturgeon-Corbyn alliance would consign this country to months, if not years, of dither, delay, discord, division. When every month of pointless delay, insisted on by Corbyn by the way, is costing this country a billion pounds for nothing.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is a rehash of an argument that David Cameron used in 2015, when he argued that an Ed Miliband government would be dependent on SNP support.

(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/13/general-election-johnson-re-launches-tory-campaign-as-labour-unveils-nhs-plan-live-news?page=with:block-5dcbe68c8f08aab51e1be264#block-5dcbe68c8f08aab51e1be264\">11.23am.) </a>Sajid Javid, the chancellor, signalled last week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/07/general-election-sajid-javid-and-john-mcdonnell-come-out-fighting-on-economy-live-news?page=with:block-5dc3f5368f08be4a102e4933#block-5dc3f5368f08be4a102e4933\">the Conservative manifesto will include tax cuts.</a></p> \n  <p>But the<strong> Resolution Foundation</strong>, an economic thinktank, has published a report (pdf) today on tax policy saying that, whoever wins the election, tax increases will be likely. Here is an extract from the summary <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/press-releases/election-2019-could-see-a-60bn-tax-pledge-gap-between-the-main-parties-the-biggest-in-a-generation/\">in its news release.</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[The report] warns that many popular claims about UK tax are misleading, and need to be set straight.</p> \n   <p>For example, it says that while tax receipts as a share of GDP are on course to reach a 40-year high in the next parliament, the average amount of total tax people pay relative to their income has been <em>falling</em> over the past four decades. Income taxes specifically are also low by international standards. In fact, the average effective tax rate on typical earnings has fallen from 30 per cent in 1975, to 25 per cent in 1990 and 18 per cent today. Were taxes on earnings still at their 1990 level, the average worker today would be paying an extra \u00a31,800 a year in tax.</p> \n   <p>The report says that whoever wins the election is going to face pressure to raise taxes to fund existing public services in an ageing society. The cost of maintaining existing education, health and social security provision is set to rise by \u00a336bn a year by the end of the decade. Added to this, the transition from fossil fuel to electric cars \u2013 a policy endorsed by all main parties \u2013 could reduce revenues from duties by up to \u00a335bn a year.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The Tories have not announced their plans yet, but there is speculation that the party will propose lifting the national insurance threshold, to bring it into line with the income tax personal allowance. \u201cThis would give most workers a tax cut of up to \u00a3480, at a cost of \u00a311bn,\u201d the report says. But it says low-income families would not get much benefit from this. It explains:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That\u2019s because working families on universal credit (UC) will immediately lose around two-thirds of any tax cut through lower benefit awards. To ensure that poorer workers gain as much as richer ones, the foundation says that the Conservatives should pledge to ensure that UC\u2019s work allowances go up in line with any tax cuts.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-13T15:27:36.741Z\">at 3.27pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dcc169c8f083559fb1ca99a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-13T14:46:28.403Z\">2.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Liberal Democrats are now looking for a new candidate in High Peak after their original candidate, <strong>Guy Kiddey</strong>, said people should vote Labour, the BBC\u2019s<strong> Chris Doidge </strong>reports.

They have six Holyrood seats, one more than the Lib Dems, and took part in the BBC\u2019s 2017 general election debate alongside Ukip.</p> \n  <p>However, the BBC has ruled this year they and the Brexit party have insufficient popular support in a Westminster election to justify inclusion: in the 2017 snap general election, the Scottish Greens only polled 0.2% of the national vote, down 1.1 percentage points on the 2015 general election.</p> \n  <p>It is understood BBC executives are annoyed that in 2017, the Scottish Greens said they were contesting a large number of seats but eventually put up only three Westminster candidates. The BBC had set a threshold of 10 candidates to merit inclusion in 2017; the party admits its scarce resources were overstretched fighting a council election that May.</p> \n  <p><strong>Patrick Harvie</strong>, the Scottish Greens co-leader, said the BBC decision meant there was no candidate to challenge the stance of the main parties on the climate crisis. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All four parties support extracting fossil fuels until 2050 and beyond. They all want to expand major roads and aviation. Only the Greens recognise this can\u2019t happen.</p> \n   <p>But it\u2019s not just on climate. The Scottish Greens are the most influential opposition party in Scotland. We have changed the tax system, granted new powers to councils and only last week, John Finnie\u2019s bill on the equal protection of children received royal assent.

If you want to have a pointless, repeated, self-indulgent activity perpetuating, then we can have a parliament with Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister in which we have pointless, repeated and self-indulgent referenda, rather than, as you say, quite rightly getting on with the people\u2019s priorities. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The question was prompted by this extract, release overnight by the Tories, from the speech that <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> will give later today. Johnson will say:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We face a historic choice. At this election the country can either move forwards with policies that will deliver years of growth and prosperity, or it can disappear into an intellectual cul-de-sac of far left Corbynism.</p> \n   <p>We can honour the wishes of the people, or else we can waste more time, at the cost of a billion pounds per month, and have two more referendums, one on Scotland and one on the EU \u2013 an expense of spirit and a waste of shame, more political self-obsession and onanism.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>(Johnson\u2019s own expertise on this subject, at least according to one of his biographers, may be limited. In her excellent book Just Boris, <strong>Sonia Purnell</strong> writes: \u201cSex, sexual organs and sexual conquests are Johnsonian mainstays of conversation.

Hoey added she would otherwise vote for the Tories or the Brexit party. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Rowena Mason and Josh Halliday have tonight\u2019s main story: Hoey also said complained that MPs had spent the last two years trying to thwart Brexit, telling LBC: We\u2019ve had two years of parliament \u2013 a remain parliament \u2013 doing everything they can to stop us leaving; by different methods and some not so serious as others. But most of the Labour MPs in there and a substantial number of Conservatives have tried to stop it. In fact, MPs voted to give Theresa May the power to trigger article 50 by a huge majority in February 2017. Hoey was then among the MPs who rejected her deal to leave the European Union in all three of the meaningful votes on it. More recently, the Commons voted to give a second reading to the legislation that would have enacted Boris Johnson\u2019s deal to withdraw from the EU. It was the prime minister who pulled it because MPs refused to allow him to fast-track it through parliament. The former Labour MP, Kate Hoey, has admitted she will not be voting for the party in next month\u2019s general election. She has told LBC radio this evening: I\u2019m actually going to be voting in Northern Ireland and unfortunately the Labour party is so anti-democratic in Northern Ireland that they allow people to join but they don\u2019t put up candidates. So, I\u2019ll be voting for a pro-union candidate in Northern Ireland. Hoey confirmed she meant a DUP candidate, saying: I\u2019m pro-union. I would not dream of voting for Sinn F\u00e9in, I wouldn\u2019t dream of voting for the SDLP and the Alliance party is in hock with both. Hoey, whose three decades as a Labour MP ended at the dissolution of parliament a week ago, said the London constituency in which she lives \u2013 Bethnal Green and Bow \u2013 would remain strongly Labour, meaning her vote would be wasted there. She said she would advise those who \u201cbelieve in Brexit\u201d, which she identified as the main focus of the election, to \u201clook at who\u2019s standing in their constituency, what their views are on the EU, how they voted, have they delayed\u201d. Asked if that meant she would have voted for the Brexit party or the Conservative party, had she chosen to vote in Great Britain, she said: Yes, I would. In this case, I think people have to realise the country comes before party politics in this election. And, for many people, that means \u2013 holding their nose, perhaps \u2013 but voting for parties that they may not have voted for in the past because they think that, actually, what we need to do is to get out and to honour that referendum. And I\u2019m afraid the Labour party\u2019s policies now on the EU are so confusing, so wrong and have reneged on everything that they promised at the last election. In May, Tony Blair\u2019s former director of communications, Alastair Campbell, was automatically expelled from the party for saying he had voted for the Lib Dems in that month\u2019s European elections. Labour has not yet said whether or not it will take similar action against Hoey. Earlier, we reported the former Conservative cabinet minister David Gauke\u2019s claim that the Tories are not \u201cbeing straight with the British public\u201d when they say they can wrap up a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020 (see 7.41pm). This evening, the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, insists they can do just that. She has told ITV\u2019s Peston programme: We have to leave the European Union. We have to deliver on it. The fact is we are determined. I\u2019m absolutely confident we will get that free trade deal done by the end of 2020. Until we reach the end of 2020, we won\u2019t know for sure. What I\u2019m saying is we can count on the fact that the prime minister managed to change the deal when people said he wouldn\u2019t be able to. We do have a 30-plus-page political declaration that sets out that template for that deal. We have a firm commitment from the European Union to signing a deal by the end of 2020. And, if we can get a majority, we will also have a UK government and a UK parliament that is determined not just to leave the EU but to get that good deal that will work for the UK and for the European Union. My colleague, Lisa O\u2019Carroll, has produced this fact-check on whether or not the UK really can get a deal done in that timeframe. As she points out, it took Canada and the EU seven years to come to a deal and experts say that, on average, trade deals take four years to negotiate: The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long Bailey, has commented on Boris Johnson\u2019s speech earlier this evening. She has said: If Boris Johnson is so keen on a \u2018green industrial revolution\u2019 why didn\u2019t he announce one? Labour is rolling out policy after policy, but we\u2019ve seen nothing from Boris Johnson. The Tories have scrapped solar subsidies, torpedoed carbon capture research, effectively banned new onshore wind and U-turned on banning fracking. The Tories are out of ideas. It\u2019s time for real change with Labour. A lot of longstanding traditional Conservative voters are \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d with the party\u2019s approach to Brexit, David Gauke has claimed. In particular, he cited a \u201cfailure to be straight with the British public that if we are going to get a free trade agreement with the European Union it\u2019s going to take more than 11 months\u201d. The former Tory, who is standing as an independent, has told Channel 4 News: It\u2019s going to take some time and it\u2019s simply not possible to do it on a timetable that says: \u2018We will leave the implementation period do or die at the end of next year\u2019. My point is not really about the merits in general of Boris Johnson. It is about a policy which I think is going to be very damaging to the country. I do think there is a failure to level with the British people that the idea that we\u2019re just going to kind of get Brexit done on 31 January and then we can move on to other things and no-one will hear about Brexit ever again \u2013 it will all be in our past \u2013 simply doesn\u2019t reflect the reality. He added: I think the Conservative party is not being straight with the British public, that this is more complex, that if we want to get a good settlement with the European Union then we are going to have to take longer to negotiate a free trade agreement and you simply cannot reconcile the reality with the government\u2019s rhetoric. Gauke said the party has \u201cchanged very rapidly\u201d in the last few months, adding that it should accommodate a range of views. But it is now taking a purity test if you like on Brexit. It is very focused on appealing to the supporters of Nigel Farage. Some of the reasons offered by the government for failing to release the report on Russian meddling in the democratic process before the election are \u201cutterly bogus\u201d, according to the former chair of the committee that produced it. Dominic Grieve, who sat at the head of the cross-party intelligence and security committee until the dissolution of parliament, has told LBC Radio this evening: I very much regret that this report as not published before the election because there was, in my view, absolutely no valid reason for that not happening. Indeed, we\u2019d worked very hard and everybody knew we wanted to get it out before the election ... and we got the classification cleared so that we had worked with the intelligence agencies and the national security secretariat to ensure that it could be published. And they were completely satisfied. So, the sign-off from the prime minister I would normally have expected to be an issue of routine, which would \u2013 generally speaking \u2013 take place in 10 days. And, if there was a problem, I would expect to have heard directly from the prime minister as to what the problem was. He\u2019s never indicated what it was. A whole series of explanations has been offered since; most of which, I\u2019m afraid, don\u2019t stack up. Some of them are utterly bogus. Asked if he felt Boris Johnson had \u201csomething to hide\u201d, he said: I have no idea why he\u2019s decided not to publish it and, in a way, I can\u2019t comment beyond that because that places me at risk of revealing what the content of the report might be ... this committee doesn\u2019t leak and, if the report is classified, then it remains classified. Grieve added that he was concerned the report might never come out at all. The Brexit party will refund its \u00a3100 fee to any general election candidate Nigel Farage has now ordered to stand down who wants it, a spokesman confirms. Farage said the Brexit party would no longer stand in any of the 317 constituencies won by the Tories in 2017 as he backed out of a fight with the party on Monday. Boris Johnson has refused to harden up his Brexit stance in a way that might have increased the chance of Nigel Farage giving the Conservative party a firmer electoral endorsement. Farage has already said that his Brexit party will not stand candidates in Tory-held seat and, ahead of the deadline tomorrow for nominations, he has been under pressure to withdraw his candidates in Labour-held marginals to help the Conservatives\u2019 chances. There was speculation that an explicit commitment by Boris Johnson to have a no-deal Brexit by the end of 2020 if the UK-EU trade deal could not be agreed by then might have been enough to win Farage around. Farage hinted as much himself this afternoon. Johnson has ruled out extending the Brexit transition beyond the end of 2020. But in interviews this morning his ally Michael Gove repeatedly insisted that there was no prospect of a no-deal Brexit at the end of next year. And, in the Q&amp;A after his speech, Johnson also declined various opportunities to talk up his willingness to countenance a no-deal Brexit, in language that might appeal to Farage. Instead he just urged the Brexit party to back the Tories to get Brexit done. He said: I just want to say about Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party. It is always a very difficult thing for any party leader to withdraw candidates from an election and I understand that. But all I can say ... for the avoidance of doubt, to repeat my central message, there is only one way to ensure that we get Brexit done - get this thing finished, get us out, do a fantastic free-trade deal - and that is to vote for us and the Conservatives. Having earlier said that it might be possible for him to vote Tory in the election, Farage posted a tweet, at around the time Johnson\u2019s Q&amp;A was coming to an end, saying that this was now impossible. This means the Tories are now set to face a Brexit party challenge in many or all of their target seats. Johnson\u2019s unwillingness to harden up his Brexit stance probably tells little about the Brexit policy he would adopt if he won the election. It is more likely that he is worried that any further pivot towards Faragism would cost him more votes from remain-inclined Tories. Johnson has recast his opponents in the election as the \u201cSturgeon-Corbyn alliance\u201d. Yesterday Jeremy Corbyn argued that the Brexit party decision to stand down in some seats meant Labour was fighting what amounted to a Trump/Farage/Johnson alliance. Today Johnson hit back by arguing that he too was up against an alliance. In his speech he argued: One thing is clear: the Sturgeon-Corbyn alliance would consign this country to months, if not years, of dither, delay, discord, division. When every month of pointless delay, insisted on by Corbyn by the way, is costing this country a billion pounds for nothing. This is a rehash of an argument that David Cameron used in 2015, when he argued that an Ed Miliband government would be dependent on SNP support. The argument reflected an assumption that Labour could not win an outright majority, but it also appealed to latent anti-Scottish sentiment amongst English voters uncomfortable at the idea of Scotland having an undue influence on UK policy. Johnson also repeated his long-standing claim that the \u201cSturgeon-Corbyn\u201d alliance would hold two referendums this year, even though Labour is saying it would not agree to a second Scottish independence one until after the Scottish parliament elections in 2021. But as he delivered the speech, Johnson did not deliver the line about how more referendums would amount to \u201cmore political self-obsession and onanism\u201d. He joked that this was because the press got hold of a \u201cstray early draft\u201d, but he knows full well the comment was in a text press-released by CCHQ. Johnson claimed that Corbyn was \u201cnaive\u201d when he told an interviewer earlier that it would have been better if the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, had been arrested by US special forces, not killed by them. In response to a question that gave a partial account of what Corbyn said, Johnson replied: Al-Baghdadi was an absolute diabolical foe of this country, of our liberal values, everything we believe in and support. I think his [Corbyn\u2019s] approach is naive and it is naive to the point of being dangerous. Corbyn did provoke outrage and incredulity in 2015 when he said it was a \u201ctragedy\u201d that Osama bin Laden had been killed by the US, not put on trial. But today, when asked if he also considered Baghdadi\u2019s death a tragedy, Corbyn avoided that phrase and gave a measured response, arguing that if it had been possible to put Baghdadi on trial, that would have been preferable. Johnson said in his speech that, after Brexit, he wanted public procurement projects to prioritise hiring British apprentices. He said: We will insist that all big public sector projects must hire British apprentices so that they can learn new skills on the job. The former Conservative justice secretary David Gauke has urged people to vote for Liberal Democrat and independent candidates, saying a majority Tory government would lead to a \u201cvery hard Brexit\u201d that would be \u201cdisastrous\u201d for the UK. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s key union supporter, Unite\u2019s Len McCluskey, has told the Labour leader that victory in the general election means winning over the party\u2019s traditional working-class supporters with a tough line on free movement of workers. Labour\u2019s NHS \u201crescue package\u201d will be funded by higher income tax rates, at 45p for those earning more than \u00a380,000 a year and 50p for those bringing in over \u00a3150,000, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has said. Jo Swinson has sought to quell a mini-rebellion in the Liberal Democrats about whether to stand in highly marginal seats held by Labour over the Conservatives, insisting the party must give voters a genuine remain option in the election. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is writing the blog now for the rest of the evening. Labour are casting this afternoon\u2019s news that Royal Mail has won an injunction preventing the first national postal strike in a decade as evidence the system favours employers over workers. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, has said: The privatisation of Royal Mail has seen the denigration of postal workers\u2019 terms and conditions, all whilst dividend payouts to private shareholders has reached \u00a31bn. Companies should engage with their workforce, rather than take them to court. This injunction will solve nothing; only negotiations will. This is further evidence that the current system is rigged against workers and trade unions. Our hardworking postal workers deserve better, that\u2019s why Labour will reverse the privatisation of Royal Mail. We will empower workers by repealing the trade union act, rolling out collective sectoral bargaining and strengthening workplace and trade union rights. Labour\u2019s plans to transition from oil and gas will be the \u201cpolar opposite\u201d of the Conservative move away from coal in the 1980s, the party\u2019s Scottish leader has said. Speaking at a miners\u2019 welfare in Uddingston, in South Lanarkshire, Richard Leonard said the \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d being touted by Labour will be \u201cby consent\u201d. We\u2019re sitting here today in a miners\u2019 welfare in the heart of the Lanarkshire coal field and it\u2019s an important reminder that, if you just let the market wreak havoc through industries and communities, it can spell disaster. What we\u2019ve said is in the change that\u2019s needed in our economy, to net-zero carbon, we need to have a just transition. It needs to be a transition in such a way that communities are not left behind. The stark contrast of our approach, which will diversify the Scottish economy away from oil and gas, couldn\u2019t be more polar opposite from the way the Tories handled the decline of the coal industry. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said he does not think his party\u2019s environmental policy would spell the end for fossil fuels. He added that he was aware of the number of jobs dependent on the fossil fuel industry. That won\u2019t end immediately, although obviously I want to end our reliance on fossil fuels. But that doesn\u2019t mean there will never be any fossil fuels. It just means that it will form part of an energy system that is more sustainable for our natural world. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is now saying that he could not vote Conservative on the basis of what they have done this week. Earlier he suggested he might. (See 5.14pm.) Q: Corbyn has ruled out a second referendum next year. Aren\u2019t you misleading the public by saying otherwise? And is not your deal with the Brexit party just as shady as any Labour/SNP cooperation? Johnson says the Tories do not do deals. On what he calls \u201cthe Sturgeon/Corbyn alliance\u201d, he says Nicola Sturgeon is Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s \u201cpath to power\u201d and his \u201cyoke-mate of destiny\u201d. She wants a referendum next year. So it is hard to see how Corbyn could turn her down. He says this country has had enough of referendums like this. He wants to get on and get Brexit done, he says. He says the potential of this country is perfectly represented by the electric vehicles being made at this factory. He is going to turbocharge \u2013 if you can turbocharge an electric vehicle \u2013 the opportunities for this country. And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: What will it mean if the Brexit party do stand against you? Johnson says his deal is ready to go. We can slam it in the oven, and be ready to leave in January. Q: Have you got a message for Nigel Farage? And why did you refer to onanism in the extracts released last night, when you did not use that word this afternoon? Johnson says he would urge people to back Conservative candidates. And he says the \u201conanism\u201d reference was in a \u201cstray early draft\u201d of his speech. Q: (From the Daily Mail) Earlier today Jeremy Corbyn questioned the US government\u2019s account of the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. [Er, not quite - see 4.28pm.] What is your reaction? Johnson says it is unrealistic to think Baghdadi could have been captured. He says he does not know the details of what Corbyn said. But if it is as the questioner suggested, Corbyn is being naive. It is naive to the point of being dangerous. Q: What would you do to restore council budgets? Johnson says the government is putting more into social care, because that is where the real pinch is. But the best way to support councils such as Coventry is to support the economy, so that the tax base is there. Q: David Gauke says if you win, that will be bad for the UK. Why should people trust you to lead the country when people who worked with you in cabinet don\u2019t trust you? Johnson says he leads a one nation government. He wants to deliver on the people\u2019s priorities. But the problem at the moment is that parliament won\u2019t push Brexit through. He says he would say to Gauke, unless the Tories have a working majority, there will be a coalition led by Jeremy Corbyn and \u201cyears of paralysis\u201d. Q: Will you apologise to the flood victims? Johnson says the emergency services have been working flat out to help people. Being hit by a flood is a terrible thing. A huge amount of work is going on. He says it is important for people to understand what financial compensation is available. He says the UK needs to invest in flood defences. Some \u00a32.6bn has already been put in, he says. But there is \u201cmuch more work to be done\u201d. Johnson is now taking questions. Q: You have been criticised for your handling of the floods, and you have got former Tories running as independents. Are you in control of this campaign? Johnson says he has visited the flood areas twice now. He pays tribute to how people are coping. The government is ready to do what it can. No one can overestimate how terrible this is for people, he says. Where there are gaps in insurance, he will sort it out, he says. On the campaign generally, he says of course we need to get Brexit done, \u201cbecause it has been paralysing politics for three years\u201d. This is from the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford. Johnson says he will make Britain the greatest place on earth. We should get on with it, he says, instead of wasting 2020 on two referendums. He asks people if they want to wake up on 13 December and find a Corbyn-Sturgeon \u201ctechnicolour coalition of chaos\u201d. Johnson says it is technical breakthroughs, like the ones being promoted by this factory, that will enable the UK to cut carbon emissions. Johnson says in 10 years\u2019 time we will all be citizens of a proud, strong and still United Kingdom that is more united than ever. Johnson repeats the discredited claim that a Labour government would mean tax rises of \u00a32,400 per person per year. He also claims John McDonnell has called for exchange controls. (McDonnell has said the opposite.) Johnson says 1.4m businesses have been created in the UK since 2010. That is more than in France and Germany combined, he says. He says this is a tribute to the enterprise economy supported by the Conservatives. He says the Tories will double funding on research and development in the next parliament, to \u00a318bn. (He says this will fund work on electric cars, but he is not clear whether all that money is for electric vehicles, or just some of it.) Johnson says, when the UK leaves the EU, the government will insist public sector procurement projects hire British workers. Johnson says British workers will get priority under Tories on public procurement projects after Brexit. Johnson says people do not know where Corbyn stands on a second referendum. Is he for leave? Is he for remain? Or is he like Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat, occupying both positions at once. He argues that the Corbyn/Sturgeon coalition would be damaging to the UK. And he says that delaying Brexit would cost the UK an extra \u00a31bn a month. (That is not true, at least for 2020. Under a Johnson Brexit the UK would have a transition period until the end of next year, during which contributions to the EU would effectively continue at the rate they are paid now.) Johnson claims there is a \u201cpent-up tidal wave\u201d of new investment waiting to flow into the UK once Brexit is done. It would be worth tens of millions, he says. He says his Brexit is ready to go. Just add water, and stir the pot, he says. (He seems to be comparing Brexit to a Pot Noodle.) Here is the extract from the speech released in advance. The UK is admired and respected around the world but people are baffled by our debate on Brexit and they cannot understand how this great country can squander so much time and energy on this question and how we can be so hesitant about our future. If we can get a working majority we can get parliament working for you, we can get out of the rut. We can end the groundhoggery of Brexit \u2026 We face a historic choice. At this election the country can either move forwards with policies that will deliver years of growth and prosperity, or it can disappear into an intellectual cul-de-sac of far left Corbynism. We can honour the wishes of the people, or else we can waste more time, at the cost of a billion pounds per month, and have two more referendums, one on Scotland and one on the EU \u2013 an expense of spirit and a waste of shame, more political self-obsession and onanism. This is why I urge everybody undecided how to vote -- imagine waking up on Friday 13th December after the election to find the Corbyn-Sturgeon coalition in Downing Street. They will ruin 2020 with two referendums, they will ruin the economy with out of control debt, they will put taxes up for everyone and instead of an Australian points system we\u2019ll have uncontrolled and unlimited immigration. Johnson says LEVC, the electric taxi company where he is speaking, represents the future. The economy has grown solidly for nine years, he says. And he says unemployment is at its lowest level since 1974. Boris Johnson has just started giving his speech. He is at a factory in Coventry that makes electric taxis. He says these taxis are symbolic of the type of politics he represents. He wants to drive change, he says. And he claims he was the midwife of these vehicles. Here is Stewart Wood, a Labour peer and a policy adviser to Ed Miliband when he was Labour leader, responding to Len McCluskey\u2019s comments on free movement. (See 1.30pm.) Who\u2019s making promises they can\u2019t keep and who do the voters trust to spend their money? To try and figure this out, Heather Stewart is joined on the Guardian\u2019s Politics Weekly podcast by the Guardian\u2019s economics editor Larry Elliott, Momentum\u2019s national coordinator Laura Parker, and professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London Tim Bale. In an interview with LBC Jeremy Corbyn was asked about the killing of the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, by US special forces in Syria last month. Corbyn replied: If we preach international law and international legal process through the international court of justice in the Hague, then we should carry it out and if it\u2019s possible to arrest somebody and put them on trial, then that is what should have been done ... Him being removed from the scene is a very good thing. If it would have been possible to arrest him - I don\u2019t know the details of the circumstances at the time, I\u2019ve only seen various statements put out by the US about it - surely that would have been the right thing to do. If we want to live in a world of peace and justice, we should practise it as well. In response the Conservative party has put out a statement from the security minister Brandon Lewis claiming that Corbyn\u2019s comment shows his \u201cinability to stand up to people who reject our values\u201d and that: \u201cEvery time [Corbyn] is given the opportunity to take the side of this country\u2019s enemies he does so.\u201d But it is hard to see how Corbyn\u2019s quote does amount to siding with Baghdadi. Even President Trump, announcing Baghdadi\u2019s death, said that capturing or killing him were both objectives for the US armed forces. ITV has some footage of Boris Johnson speaking to residents in Doncaster about the flooding. When Tory MPs chose him as their leader in the summer, some of them thought he had a magic touch with voters. There doesn\u2019t seem to be much evidence of that from the video footage we\u2019ve seen of him today (although of course that\u2019s not to say Theresa May would have been any better). Alastair Campbell, the former communications director for Tony Blair who was expelled by Labour in the spring for voting Lib Dem in the European elections, has said that he will be campaigning for David Gauke, the Tory-turned-independent pro-European, in South West Hertfordshire. He told the ITV election podcast, Calling Peston: I will go to [South West Hertfordshire] and campaign for David Gauke, I would go and help Philip Lee, I think we\u2019ve all got to do what we can do \u2026 It really depresses me, why are the Greens standing against Anna Soubry? A prominent campaigner for a second referendum, Campbell has also argued on Twitter that it is essential for the pro-remain parties to cooperate. The call from Leave.EU\u2019s Arron Banks for Nigel Farage withdraw candidates in Labour seats to avoid splitting the rightwing vote has been rubbished in Peterborough by the Brexit party candidate, Mike Greene, who told the Guardian: \u201cI have never been driven by Arron Banks.\u201d Labour squeaked to victory in the marginal by just 683 votes in the June byelection but only after the Conservatives and Greene gathered 17,044 votes between them - 6,560 more than Labour\u2019s Lisa Forbes. Greene, a multi-millionaire businessman who is campaigning in a Brexit party-branded Land Rover Defender with personalised plates, predicted that far from allowing the Conservatives to win if he stood aside, as hundreds of Brexit candidates did in Tory-held seats on Monday, Labour would increase its majority. \u201cI am not going to step aside for party politics,\u201d Greene said while campaigning in the pro-leave ward of Werrington. I am going to do what is right for Peterborough. Boris\u2019s version of Brexit will be weak. If I step aside we are going to end up with another MP who will become a parliamentary puppet and won\u2019t do anything for the city. The argument against what Banks says is I want to put people first. There is more to Britain, more to Peterborough and more to life than Brexit. Voters in Peterborough appear in confusion with some Brexit party voters saying they will switch to Conservative, and Labour voters switching to Lib Dem and Conservative depending on Brexit allegiances. Many others are losing faith with parliament to deliver whatever they vote and considering abstaining. Labour is hoping it can focus on the impact of austerity on public services rather than Brexit, to bolster its slim lead. Greene admitted Brexit would mean \u201cyou are going to go through some pain\u201d but dismissed as biased a recent study by economists at Kings College London and London School of Economics suggesting annual economic losses of up to \u00a32,500 per capita after a decade. He said: We know over 70% of academics are left-leaning and a lot of EU funding goes into them. The whole academic system is academically biased. It ain\u2019t going to be roses from the day we leave. You need to look at the hockey stick in its entirety and realise how much more upside there is. Plaid Cymru is today calling for for the establishment of a national health and care service, with social care provided free at the point of need. On social care, we do seem to be getting closer to the point where the parties are reaching consensus on the need for a national care service. Yesterday the IPPR thinktank published a report calling for free personal care to be introduced in England, at a cost of up to \u00a310bn. The IPPR is a leftwing thinktank, but its recommendations were quite similar to those from the House of Lords economic affairs committee in a report this summer, and that committee is chaired by Michael Forsyth, who was about the most Thatcherite member of the cabinet when the Tories were in power in the mid-1990s. Labour has already proposed a \u201cnational care service\u201d, and it is due to publish further details of how this might work soon. And there are rumours that the Conservatives will offer something similar. Plaid may be pushing at an open door. From the New Statesman\u2019s Jeremy Cliffe At his news conference this morning John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said that 95% of taxpayers would not pay higher rates of income tax or national insurance under Labour. (See 11.23am.) Sajid Javid, the chancellor, signalled last week that the Conservative manifesto will include tax cuts. But the Resolution Foundation, an economic thinktank, has published a report (pdf) today on tax policy saying that, whoever wins the election, tax increases will be likely. Here is an extract from the summary in its news release. [The report] warns that many popular claims about UK tax are misleading, and need to be set straight. For example, it says that while tax receipts as a share of GDP are on course to reach a 40-year high in the next parliament, the average amount of total tax people pay relative to their income has been falling over the past four decades. Income taxes specifically are also low by international standards. In fact, the average effective tax rate on typical earnings has fallen from 30 per cent in 1975, to 25 per cent in 1990 and 18 per cent today. Were taxes on earnings still at their 1990 level, the average worker today would be paying an extra \u00a31,800 a year in tax. The report says that whoever wins the election is going to face pressure to raise taxes to fund existing public services in an ageing society. The cost of maintaining existing education, health and social security provision is set to rise by \u00a336bn a year by the end of the decade. Added to this, the transition from fossil fuel to electric cars \u2013 a policy endorsed by all main parties \u2013 could reduce revenues from duties by up to \u00a335bn a year. The Tories have not announced their plans yet, but there is speculation that the party will propose lifting the national insurance threshold, to bring it into line with the income tax personal allowance. \u201cThis would give most workers a tax cut of up to \u00a3480, at a cost of \u00a311bn,\u201d the report says. But it says low-income families would not get much benefit from this. It explains: That\u2019s because working families on universal credit (UC) will immediately lose around two-thirds of any tax cut through lower benefit awards. To ensure that poorer workers gain as much as richer ones, the foundation says that the Conservatives should pledge to ensure that UC\u2019s work allowances go up in line with any tax cuts. The Liberal Democrats are now looking for a new candidate in High Peak after their original candidate, Guy Kiddey, said people should vote Labour, the BBC\u2019s Chris Doidge reports. High Peak is a Labour/Tory marginal. Kiddey was angry about his party not standing down in Canterbury. (See 10.02am.) The Conservatives have claimed that Jeremy Corbyn is \u201cin complete disarray\u2019 over Scottish independence in the light of his comment this morning, and the subsequent briefing clarifying the party\u2019s stance. (See 1.21pm.) Stephen Kerr, the Scottish Conservative candidate for Stirling said: On the biggest issue in Scotland, the future of the Union, Jeremy Corbyn is in complete disarray. Barely before he\u2019d finished speaking, he was being \u2018clarified\u2019 by his aides. The only thing that\u2019s clear is that he simply cannot be trusted to back Scotland\u2019s place in the UK. It\u2019s no wonder leading Labour party figures like Tom Harris [see 8.42am] are urging Scots to vote Scottish Conservative at this election, to stop Scotland going back to a second referendum. From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh The person who heckled Jeremy Corbyn in Scotland (see 12.45pm) was a Church of Scotland minister, as the Church Times\u2019 Adam Becket reports. He is also a minister who allegedly has what appear to be extreme views. These are from Sky\u2019s Tom Rayner. These are from Torsten Bell, a former Labour policy adviser who now runs the Resolution Foundation, an economic thinktank, on Labour\u2019s health proposals. In a statement issued by the SNP, Neil Gray, the party\u2019s candidate in Airdrie and Shotts, has said that Jeremy Corbyn would not have the right to refuse Scotland a second independence referendum. (See 1.21pm.) Gray said: These latest comments show that privately Labour are well aware that their undemocratic position of simply ignoring the Scottish people, no matter what they say, is completely unsustainable. And with the once-dominant Scottish Labour party now at the point of extinction, and Labour voters turning to the SNP, Jeremy Corbyn is in absolutely no position to tell the people of Scotland if and when they can have a say over their own future. As we have made crystal clear, no one looking for support from the SNP after this election should bother to even pick up the phone unless they are prepared to accept the democratically expressed will of Scotland. In his interviews this morning Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, rejected claims that there might be a no-deal Brexit at the end of 2020 because negotiating a trade deal with the EU within a year may prove impossible and because Boris Johnson has ruled out extending the Brexit transition into 2021 or 2o22. But, in an interview with ITV\u2019s Daniel Hewitt, Gove could not give an example of a trade deal like this being negotiated so quickly. Boris Johnson has been accused of doing nothing to help flood victims as he visited one of the worst hit areas and told residents: \u201cWe\u2019ve been on it round the clock.\u201d My colleague Josh Halliday has written up his visit here. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s key union supporter, Unite\u2019s Len McCluskey, has told the Labour leader that victory in the general election means winning over the party\u2019s traditional working-class supporters with a tough line on free movement of workers, my colleague Larry Elliott reports. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has insisted that her party will field candidates in Canterbury, a Labour/Tory marginal where local activists want the party to stand down to help the pro-remain Labour candidate (see 10.02am), and in South West Hertfordshire, where the pro-remain former Tory cabinet minister David Gauke is standing as an independent. On a visit to a boxing club in Crouch End in north London, Swinson was asked if she was losing control of Lib Dem candidates. She told the Press Association. No. Clearly as Liberal Democrats we are committed to stopping Brexit. We have a healthy debate within the party and some candidates have made their own decisions. And here is more footage of Boris Johnson getting a frosty reception from residents affected by flooding in South Yorkshire. Jeremy Corbyn also had his own encounter with a hostile member of the public this morning, the BBC reports. Probably the most powerful attack line used by the Conservatives against Labour in this campaign is the charge that, under Jeremy Corbyn, there would be two referendums in 2020. The latest incarnation of this allegation is in Boris Johnson\u2019s onanism quote. (See 9.43am.) It is true that Labour would hold another Brexit referendum next year. And it is true that the SNP wants to hold a Scottish independence referendum in 2020, and that it would demand one from a Labour government. It is also true that Corbyn would agree to one at some point, but Labour has ruled out holding one in the early years of a Labour government. In an interview in Glasgow this morning Corbyn said something that appeared to close down this Tory line of attack. He said there would be: No referendum in the first term for a Labour government because I think we need to concentrate completely on investment across Scotland. But, according to the Press Association, aides later clarified the party\u2019s position, saying that if the SNP won a majority in the Holyrood elections in 2021 (although in government, the SNP does not currently have a majority in the Scottish parliament), Labour\u2019s position could change. This is from the BBC\u2019s Scotland editor, Sarah Smith. And these are from the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley. Meanwhile, in South Yorkshire, not everyone has been happy to see the prime minister ... Q: Under the Tories NHS staff have to ask patients at A&amp;E for their passports to check they are entitled to treatment. Would you stop this? Ashworth says this policy is \u201cobnoxious\u201d. Labour has asked for the impact assessment of this policy, but the government has not published it. He says Labour would suspend those regulations. Ashworth says Labour would stop hospital staff having to check the nationality of patients to be sure of their entitlement for free treatment. The Q&amp;A is now over. Ashworth says Labour will introduce plans in its first Queen\u2019s speech to end privatisation in the NHS. Q: Would you extend the sugar tax? Ashworth says Labour would expand it to milky drinks, milkshakes. He says Matt Hancock thinks all you need to improve public health is a smartphone and an app. Ashworth says he does not agree with this. He says A \u201dFuture Generations Wellbeing Act\u201d would make a big difference. There is something similar in Wales, he says. Legislation like this would force public bodies to get serious about public health. He says Nye Bevan described the NHS as \u201csocialism in action\u201d when he set it up. But it has never addressed health inequalities. It is not right that people living in the constituencies that he and McDonnell represent will die 10 years on average before people in other places. Q: Are you happy to have a Labour candidate who posted a picture on social media of a gun being held to Theresa May\u2019s head? McDonnell says people can make mistakes, and learn from them. He says, as a Catholic, he was brought up to believe in redemption. Q: Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, used to work for a big US health company. People think he is a privatiser. Would you get rid of him? Ashworth says Stevens also used to work for Frank Dobson. He says it is not right to comment on civil servants, but he says that he has worked well with Stevens and that he respects him. Q: Under a Labour Brexit would you allow freedom of movement to continue? Ashworth says his position is that trusts should be able to continue to recruit internationally. Q: Will you reform doctors\u2019 pensions? The current rules are forcing doctors to retire early. Ashworth accepts this is an issue. Labour would review the rules urgently. There must be a fair solution, he says. Q: What do you think of the Brexit party standing down in Tory-held seats. And what will happen if they stand down in Labour-held seats? McDonnell says this decision helps Labour, because it shows voters they are up against a Trump/Farage/Johnson alliance to sell off the NHS. He says Nigel Farage was only doing what Donald Trump said he should do in their LBC interview. He says the public don\u2019t like deals like this anyway. I don\u2019t think our people like these dodgy deals behind the scenes. He says, when people go to vote, he wants them to be aware of the risk to the NHS from this alliance. Q: Was Ashworth wrong to say the NHS would not be covered by the four-day week? McDonnell says Ashworth was destroying the \u201cmyth\u201d put out by the Conservatives that the NHS would be destroyed by a four-day week coming in from day one. He repeats the explanation of the Labour policy he went through earlier. (See 11.53am.) He says he wants the economy to grow. That generates more in tax revenue. He says that would mean you could afford to hire more staff to compensate for the shorter hours being worked. It is a 10-year programme he is proposing, he says. He says he wants to build a consensus and take people with him. That is how Labour introduced the minimum wage. It would introduce a working time commission, he says. Q: What would you do on social care, and on free movement? Ashworth says Labour will be making an announcement about social care later in the campaign. On free movement, he says if an NHS trust thinks a doctor or nurse is qualified enough to care for the sick and elderly, they should be allowed in. The Tories announced plans for an NHS visa. But that would still amount to a \u00a3400 nurses\u2019 tax, he says. John McDonnell and Jonathan Ashworth are now taking questions. Q: Are you worried that you might be raising expectations unreasonably? Ashworth says this is \u201csubstantial investment\u201d, not just for the NHS, but for related services. He says the Tories last year announced more money for the NHS day-to-day health budget. But other health services, like sexual health services, continued to be cut. He says it has got to the point where maternity units are now finding babies with neo-natal syphilis because sexual health services have been cut back by so much. Organisations like the Health Foundation are saying this is a big increase, he says. Q: At Labour conference you said you wanted a four-day working week. You said you it would apply to everyone. But Ashworth said it would not apply to the NHS. Which is it? McDonnell says he is proposing moving towards a 32-hour working week. He thinks this should be planned and negotiated over time. As investment goes into the economy, it should be more productive. That wealth should be shared with workers. It can be shared in two ways: through higher wages, or a shorter working week. The process of cutting working hours started in the 1860s, he says. But he says recently that process stalled. He wants further cuts. \u201cWe work to live, we don\u2019t live to work,\u201d he says. He says he wants this process to apply to everyone. He says what he is proposing would happen over a decade. He says Ashworth was making the point this would happen gradually. This will be popular, he says. He says in his constituency parents work different shifts. Family life breaks down. He says what Labour is trying to do is change that. Ashworth says he would be a health secretary who cares for NHS staff, not one who picks fights with them. We will increase the budget for training, development and education by \u00a31bn a year. We will allow the NHS to recruit internationally ethically but without hindrance. We will bring back a training bursary for nurses, midwives and allied health professionals and we will expand GP training places to 5,000 to recruit more family doctors in local communities providing 27m extra GP appointments. Announcements on allocations for our national care service and free personal care will be made in the coming days. Ashworth says addressing vaccination rates will be a particular priority. Earlier this year we lost our measles free status. Measles is a horrible, life threatening disease and yet vaccination rates have fallen now five years in a row. This isn\u2019t simply about anti vaxx propaganda on social media - as Mr Hancock claims - but the toxic combination of the Tory Health and Social Care Act reorganisation, the squeeze on primary care and cuts to public health services. We are determined to restore our WHO measles free status, so as a start we will invest \u00a335m a year in improving vaccination uptake and we will recruit an extra 4,800 health visitors and school nurses too. Ashworth says Labour would address inequality through a Future Generations Wellbeing Act. Rates of premature deaths including deaths linked to heart disease, lung cancers, COPD are two times higher in the most deprived areas of England compared to the most affluent. We see a higher rate of suicide in more deprived areas and higher rates of addiction. We will relentlessly target health inequalities as part of our wellbeing strategy. We will legislate with a new Future Generations Wellbeing Act. We will commit to halving childhood obesity by 2030 and tackle the wider determinants of ill health such as banning junk food advertising before the 9pm watershed. Ashworth pays tribute to Frank Dobson, the former Labour health secretary whose death was announced yesterday. He goes on: Frank said \u201cinequality in health is the worst inequality of all. There is no more serious inequality than knowing you\u2019ll die sooner because you\u2019re badly off.\u201d He was so right. Ashworth says Labour would prioritise mental health. I don\u2019t believe a comprehensive mental health service has ever been delivered. Yet today stress, anxiety and depression are the biggest cause of sickness absence in our society, responsible for 91m working days lost every year costing the UK economy \u00a399bn a year. Last year the number of prescriptions for anti-depressions hit their highest level - with over 70m prescriptions dispensed. 100,000 children and young people simply don\u2019t get the mental health support they need. We will as a government prioritise mental health and wellbeing like never before. Ashworth explains what he expects to happen under the Labour plan. Firstly, the money available for our primary and secondary care services will increase. The so-called NHS England revenue budget will increase by 3.9 per cent. An increase on Tory plans. We will invest more to relentlessly drive up performance and drive down waiting times ... Faulty and out of date equipment lead to cancelled operations and increasing delays for patients receiving diagnostic tests results. We will deliver our commitment that less than one per cent of patients should wait longer than six weeks for a diagnostic test. And because we want cancer survival rates to be amongst the best in the world we will invest to deliver a shift in early cancer diagnosis from 2 in 4, to 3 in 4 cancer cases over the next decade. So today we are committing an extra \u00a31.5bn of capital for diagnostics. We have fewer MRI and CT scanners per capita than most OECD countries so will increase the numbers of scanners towards the international average. Overall NHS capital expenditure will increase to meet the OECD average through public investment. That will mean an extra \u00a315 billion capital investment to rebuild crumbling hospitals and invest in the cutting-edge medical technology of the future ... The NHS will be literally rebuilt under a Labour government. We will honour confirming hospital rebuilds but future decisions on hospital rebuilds will be based on not on party political considerations as it is now under the Tories, but based on critical needs, be fully transparent and spread fairly across the regions. We will institute a green new deal for the NHS to ensure trusts can access funding to reduce their carbon footprint and we will institute an NHS Forest with a million extra trees across the estate. We will ensure an extra \u00a32.5 billion investment to upgrade primary and community health facilities. Ashworth summarises problems with the NHS. Cancer waiting times are the worst on record. Last year over 34,000 people with cancer waited beyond two months for treatment. On all eight measures collected 2019/20 performance is lower than the previous year. Meanwhile waits for diagnostic tests are at their highest for 11 years. At the Labour event Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, is now speaking. He claims patients face a \u201cwinter of misery\u201d. In the last year 625,000 have languished on trolleys in corridors. Our A&amp;E departments have been in year-round crisis. Indeed, September\u2019s A&amp;E waits were the worst performance outside the winter months. Ambulances are unable to off load patients because A&amp;Es are full. A&amp;E patients can\u2019t clear spaces because there are no acute beds to move patients to. In a typical hospital this winter, there will be no acute beds for the medically fit but vulnerable and elderly people can\u2019t be discharged because social care services have been savaged. Tomorrow we anticipate further NHS performance data confirming our worst fears of a winter of misery for patients. Just as patients wait longer in A&amp;E, they wait longer for treatment to. Waiting lists for treatment have risen to record levels and patients are increasingly waiting longer for care. McDonnell says, unlike the Tories, Labour is explaining how it would fund its proposed NHS spending increase. The other dividing line between us and the Tories is that we are responsible enough to commit to where our funding comes from. We have had none of that from the Tories. Last week I announced in Liverpool a newsocial transformation fund \u2013 \u00a3150bn over five years for the social infrastructure that is the glue that holds our communities together. Our \u00a315bn capital commitment today will come from that social transformation fund and the day-to-day spending increase will be funded by taxing the top 5% at a higher rate of income tax. As I have said before, income tax rates, national insurance, and VAT will not increase for 95%. It is only the 5% we will ask to pay a little more. (We will reduce the threshold for 45p rate to \u00a380,000 and reintroduce the 50p rate for \u00a3125,000.) That is our pledge. McDonnell is now summing up the Labour NHS proposal. A \u00a326bn real terms healthcare funding boost from 2018-19 to 2023-24. An annual average 4.3% real-terms increase for health spending over the next four years, which will take the total Department of Health and Social Care budget to \u00a3178bn in 2023-24. With capital expenditure \u2013 so neglected by the Tories \u2013 rising to the international average, and boosted by \u00a315bn over five years. On each of these fronts, the Tories have offered weak commitments, reflecting their hostility to free public services and the need for us to care for each other. On overall funding between 2019 to 2024, the Conservatives have promised just \u00a320bn in real terms, \u00a36bn more than Theresa May announced in 2018. On annual increases, almost everyone in the room will be familiar with what the Tories have spent in this decade of decay. McDonnell says austerity was a political choice. It has left the NHS underfunded, he says. As the Tories have spent money cutting capital gains tax accruing to the rich, cuts and privatisation to our NHS has left our country struggling to treat cancer patients safely. As the Tories waste money by failing to properly tackle tax avoidance, support services for young people have been ripped out of their communities. As the Tories\u2019 cuts to corporation tax have continue to increase dividends for the very richest, more than 1 million NHS patients could face long waits in emergency departments and almost 300,000 patients could also be left waiting on trolleys. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is speaking at the launch of Labour\u2019s \u00a326bn \u201crescue plan\u201d for the NHS. He claims the first week of the election campaign has shown the Conservatives in their true colours. It is a week where we have seen the Tories\u2019 true colours: Jacob Rees-Mogg showing unforgivable arrogance in criticising the \u201ccommon sense\u201d of the Grenfell Tower victims. The Tories resorting to fake news in the fantasy numbers they\u2019ve concocted to criticise our plans. Then the chancellor refusing to debate me to defend their record and their lies. We will continue to present our positive vision to tackle climate change and rampant inequality, and we will continue show at every opportunity our comprehensive costed plan to deliver on that vision. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, has challenged Westminster to \u201cstop obsessing\u201d about nuclear power and \u201cget its act together\u201d on green energy. As the Press Association reports, at a campaign event in Edinburgh she said that a large team of SNP MPs in the House of Commons would push the UK government to act on the climate emergency. She said: At this election, Scotland can elect a strong team of SNP MPs to demand the radical action needed to tackle the climate emergency and secure the future of our green energy industry. Scotland is already a world leader on tackling the climate crisis and delivering green energy. By contrast, Westminster has wasted years obsessing over nuclear power and a complete lack of vision and ambition over the energy technologies of the future. Put bluntly, there is no more time to waste - it\u2019s time for Westminster to get its act together. The Scottish government has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2045 - five years ahead of the corresponding UK target. My colleague Peter Walker says Liberal Democrat HQ is not willing to stand down in High Peak. (See 10.02am.) When Theresa May announced her plan in 2018 to give the NHS a \u00a320bn, long-term spending increase, she liked to argue that what she was offering was more generous than what Labour was proposing for the NHS in its 2017 election manifesto. There was some dispute about that (Channel 4 News\u2019 FactCheck has a good analysis here), but the Labour manifesto offer two years ago was certainly quite modest compared to what is on the table today. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has just published an analysis of Labour\u2019s plan and here is a chart summing up what\u2019s on offer. And here is an extract from the IFS analysis. It says Labour\u2019s plans amount to a real-terms increase in health spending worth 4.3% a year. UK health spending has historically grown at an average real rate of 3.6% per year, but grew by just 1.3% per year between 2009\u221210 and 2018\u221219. Growth in total Department of Health and Social Care spending of 2.9% per year [an assumption based on the government\u2019s plans for extra NHS-spending, but assuming non-NHS health spending is frozen after 2021] would therefore be at a slower rate than the long-run average, but at a faster rate than has been the case since 2010. Annual real growth of 4.3% per year, as under Labour\u2019s new proposals, would be at a faster rate than the historical average, and puts health spending on a far more generous path than was implied by both parties\u2019 2017 general election manifestos. From YouGov\u2019s Chris Curtis, on the latest YouGov poll out yesterday Here is Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall on Boris Johnson\u2019s onanism remark. (See 9.43am.) ITV\u2019s Joe Pike says Boris Johnson is not giving interview to regional media on his visit to South Yorkshire. Boris Johnson is in South Yorkshire inspecting areas affected by the flooding. Sky News is showing some live footage. To a casual observer it might look as though he is following in the footsteps of Jeremy Corbyn, who was in the region yesterday, but Johnson also paid a visit to a flood-affected town last week. That trip was notable for what it revealed about his inability to use a mop properly. These are from YouGov, the polling organisation. Politicians have always been sceptical of these questions - they think the people\u2019s theoretical willingness to pay more in tax to for better public services is not matched by their actual enthusiasm for this - although when Gordon Brown increase national insurance in his 2002 budget to raise more money for the NHS, the decision turned out to be extraordinarily popular. (Brown\u2019s move remains a textbook example in how to win popular consent for a tax rise; he did it by orchestrating a year-long public debate showing why the NHS needed the money.) As my colleague Peter Walker reports, the Liberal Democrats are facing a revolt from activists in Canterbury, where local members are unhappy about party HQ\u2019s decision to select a new candidate to replace Tim Walker, who stood down to help Labour hold the seat where it had a majority of just 187 at the last election. Walker and other local Liberal Democrats are worried that if their party stands Labour\u2019s Rosie Duffield, a remainer, will be defeated and replaced by a pro-Brexit Tory. According to the BBC\u2019s Chris Doidge, Guy Kiddey, the Lib Dem candidate in High Peak in Derbyshire is also planning to stand down in solidarity with Tom Walker. High Peak is another Labour/Tory marginal, where Labour had a majority of 2,322 in 2017. Two years ago the Lib Dem candidate in the seat got 2,669 votes. BBC Scotland has rejected a request from the Scottish Greens to be included in its live election debate two days before polling day, claiming the party has insufficient electoral support. The BBC debate at 8pm on Tuesday 10 December is expected to feature the leaders of Scotland\u2019s four main parties \u2013 Nicola Sturgeon for the Scottish National party, Jackson Carlaw for the Conservatives, Richard Leonard for Labour and Willie Rennie for the Lib Dems. The Scottish Greens are putting up 22 candidates for the general election, leaving the majority of Scotland\u2019s 59 Westminster seats uncontested. They have six Holyrood seats, one more than the Lib Dems, and took part in the BBC\u2019s 2017 general election debate alongside Ukip. However, the BBC has ruled this year they and the Brexit party have insufficient popular support in a Westminster election to justify inclusion: in the 2017 snap general election, the Scottish Greens only polled 0.2% of the national vote, down 1.1 percentage points on the 2015 general election. It is understood BBC executives are annoyed that in 2017, the Scottish Greens said they were contesting a large number of seats but eventually put up only three Westminster candidates. The BBC had set a threshold of 10 candidates to merit inclusion in 2017; the party admits its scarce resources were overstretched fighting a council election that May. Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Greens co-leader, said the BBC decision meant there was no candidate to challenge the stance of the main parties on the climate crisis. He said: All four parties support extracting fossil fuels until 2050 and beyond. They all want to expand major roads and aviation. Only the Greens recognise this can\u2019t happen. But it\u2019s not just on climate. The Scottish Greens are the most influential opposition party in Scotland. We have changed the tax system, granted new powers to councils and only last week, John Finnie\u2019s bill on the equal protection of children received royal assent. To leave us out of the debate is ridiculous. The Michael Gove/Nick Robinson exchange may not have shed much light on the Conservatives\u2019 policies on Brexit, or on anything else (Gove firmly rejected the suggestion that a no-deal Brexit was possible at the end of the transition period, but without properly explaining why), but it did feature what is probably a general election first - a Today programme discussion about the similarities between contemporary politics and masturbation. Here is the key exchange. NR: The prime minister has got some colourful language in a speech today. He warns of onanism, which for those who are not familiar with their Bible may not realise is a posh word for self-gratification. Would that word not be better applied to those of you who have obsessed with our membership of the European Union, rather than getting on with the people\u2019s priorities. MG: I\u2019m glad that you say we should get on with the people\u2019s priorities. If you want to have a pointless, repeated, self-indulgent activity perpetuating, then we can have a parliament with Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister in which we have pointless, repeated and self-indulgent referenda, rather than, as you say, quite rightly getting on with the people\u2019s priorities. The question was prompted by this extract, release overnight by the Tories, from the speech that Boris Johnson will give later today. Johnson will say: We face a historic choice. At this election the country can either move forwards with policies that will deliver years of growth and prosperity, or it can disappear into an intellectual cul-de-sac of far left Corbynism. We can honour the wishes of the people, or else we can waste more time, at the cost of a billion pounds per month, and have two more referendums, one on Scotland and one on the EU \u2013 an expense of spirit and a waste of shame, more political self-obsession and onanism. (Johnson\u2019s own expertise on this subject, at least according to one of his biographers, may be limited. In her excellent book Just Boris, Sonia Purnell writes: \u201cSex, sexual organs and sexual conquests are Johnsonian mainstays of conversation. Later, Boris infamously told a girlfriend that such was the number of his sexual partners that he hadn\u2019t had \u2018to have a wank for 20 years\u2019.\u201d During his combative Today interview with Nick Robinson, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, was asked why the proposed Conservative inquiry into Islamophobia in the party had turned into an inquiry into Islamophobia and prejudice. Robinson said that when Gove was on the programme only last week, he said it would be an Islamophobia-only inquiry. Gove denied this. A bit later on the programme Robinson offered a clarification. He said that at one point in his interview last week Gove implied it would be an Islamophobia-only inquiry. At another point in the same interview he implied it would be a more general inquiry. Lady Warsi, the former Conservative party chair and a longstanding campaigner for a specific inquiry into Islamophobia in the party, told the programme: Well, I welcome any form of inquiry. I\u2019ve got to the point where beggars can\u2019t be choosers any more. But I am disappointed that the party, having now realised that there is a real problem in relation to a specific form of racism, is still trying to absolve its responsibility by trying to dilute what it is that it\u2019s going to look at ... The fact that we\u2019re still prevaricating about even having an inquiry, and the kind of inquiry we\u2019re going to have, shows just how dismissive the party has been on the issue of Islamophobia. A report by my colleague Simon Murphy, saying that 25 sitting and former Tory councillors have been exposed for posting Islamophobic and racist material on social media, has highlighted the extent to which this remains a problem for the Conservatives. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Simon Murphy. Amongst all the campaigning today, there are two headline media events. 11am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, speak at an event to launch Labour\u2019s \u00a326bn \u201crescue plan\u201d for the NHS. 4.30pm: Boris Johnson is giving a speech on Brexit in Warwickshire. And Jeremy Corbyn is campaigning in Scotland, where he has events organised in Glasgow (at 10.30am), in Hamilton (at 12.15pm) and in Coatbridge (at 2.30pm.) Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, has refused to accept that no deal is effectively back on the table with a new Brexit deadline of the end of 2020 for a trade agreement. Gove\u2019s friend and former colleague David Gauke, who is running as an independent after having the Tory whip removed as punishment for rebelling, warned earlier that \u201cwe will leave the implementation period without a deal with the European Union on WTO terms, in effect on no-deal terms\u201d. (See 8.38am.) Gove told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I\u2019ve got a lot of respect and affection for David but I think in this one particular area he\u2019s wrong because what we have is a Brexit deal that\u2019s been negotiated, a withdrawal agreement which will make sure we safeguard the rights of UK citizens abroad and EU citizens in the UK and also a political declaration that spells out a future relationship based on free trade and friendly cooperation. Former Conservative minister David Gauke is not holding back this morning. He\u2019s now told Sky\u2019s Kay Burley the policy pursued by the prime minister is \u201creckless and irresponsible\u201d and a majority Conservative government \u201cwould be detrimental to people\u2019s jobs and livelihoods\u201d. Urging people not to vote Tory, he adds: I think the Conservative party has fundamentally changed. There are a lot of traditional Conservative voters who feel politically homeless. Many of them will vote for the Lib Dems ... and they are right to. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, says the party\u2019s pledge to fund the NHS with an extra \u00a326bn a year will be \u201ctransformative\u201d. Labour is today unveiling a \u201crescue plan\u201d for the NHS in England with the extra funding paid for by higher taxes on companies and the wealthiest in society. Ashworth told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: We\u2019ll use this extra funding to raise performance in our NHS. Remember, we\u2019ve got around four and a half million people on the waiting lists. Many elderly people left languishing on trolleys in hospital corridors and we\u2019re anticipating that to get particularly worse this winter. Challenged on whether the money will be genuinely transformative rather than just allowing the NHS to get back on top of waiting lists, Ashworth said: If I may say so, and I say this with utmost politeness, when you\u2019ve got patients with glaucoma [a degenerative eye condition] at Southampton waiting so long for treatment that they go blind, including a pregnant mother who went blind and now has never seen the face of her daughter because of waits, I think putting more money in to turn around waiting lists is transformative. Ashworth was referring to a damning case first revealed by the Times which reported on how 15 hospital patients were left blind or with severe sight loss after staff shortages led to delays in their treatment. Bad news for Labour in Scotland as the party\u2019s former minister Tom Harris, who was MP for Glasgow South, has revealed he is voting Tory \u2013 saying that Jeremy Corbyn is a threat to the UK. Harris condemned some Labour candidates who \u201ccontinue to spout racist, antisemitic hatred\u201d, reports the Scottish Daily Mail. Harris quit Labour last year after 34 years in the party. Ruth Davidson, former leader of the Scottish Conservative party, has tweeted the Scottish Daily Mail\u2019s front page this morning: Here\u2019s Conservative minister Michael Gove hitting back at his former colleague and \u201cgood friend\u201d David Gauke\u2019s criticism of the party, highlighting that there are \u201csome very powerful voices from within Labour ... warning us of the dangers of Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. David Gauke, one of 21 Tory MPs who had the whip removed after rebelling against the government, says a Conservative majority will veer the country to a \u201cvery hard Brexit\u201d that would be \u201cdisastrous for the prosperity of this country\u201d. The former Tory MP and justice secretary has opened up about his reasons for standing as an independent candidate in the general election, telling BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: The reason being, and this pains me to say it, but a Conservative majority after the next general election will take us in the direction of a very hard Brexit. And in all likelihood at the end of 2020 we will leave the implementation period without a deal with the European Union on WTO terms, in effect on no-deal terms. And that, I believe, would be disastrous for the prosperity of this country. Asked about his decision to run as an independent, unlike former chancellor Philip Hammond \u2013 who also had the whip removed for rebelling against the government in order to stop a no-deal Brexit \u2013 he said: Different individuals will reach different choices. I\u2019ve got an enormous amount of respect for Philip. He is motivated by the national interest and that has run through his entire career. But I, in good faith, have reached a different conclusion. I believe I can influence events in this general election to some small extent. And I think the best way I can do that. He says he hopes the Liberal Democrats will stand aside in his seat in South West Hertfordshire but adds that \u201cis a decision for them\u201d. Gauke is also backing a second referendum on Johnson\u2019s deal. Hello folks, Simon Murphy here, taking the helm of the liveblog to steer you through this morning\u2019s politics news. Labour is to unveil a \u201crescue plan\u201d for the NHS in England with an extra \u00a326bn of funding a year paid for by higher taxes on companies and the wealthiest in society, as the party puts the health service at the heart of its election offer to voters. The party\u2019s pledge would give the health service \u00a35.5bn more a year by 2023-24 than the \u00a320.5bn the Conservatives have promised and represent the biggest boost to health spending since Labour was last in power between 1997 and 2010. It puts pressure on Boris Johnson to increase the money he is committing to the NHS, which he has made one of his three \u201cpeople\u2019s priorities\u201d and sought to make a Tory vote-winner. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, will say that \u201cproper funding\u201d is needed to maintain a world-class health service as he proposes a 4.3% annual rise in funding. Labour says the sums it is pledging would end the lengthening delays faced by patients for A&amp;E care, cancer treatment and planned operations, tackle the NHS\u2019s worsening staffing crisis, restore bursaries for student nurses, improve mental healthcare, let hospitals buy scores of new CT and MRI scanners and pay for a new generation of hospitals, GP surgeries and mental health facilities. How the papers covered it The Guardian features a picture from the Australian bushfires but leads with election news and Labour\u2019s \u201c\u00a326bn rescue plan for NHS\u201d. The Mirror calls that \u201cLabour\u2019s 10-point plan to save the NHS\u201d. The i\u2019s angle is \u201cBattle for the NHS\u201d as the Tories also flash more cash for the health service. The Times and the Express focus on a 14-point lead for the Tories. YouGov for the Times has put the Tories on 42%, Labour on 28% and the Lib Dems on 15%. The Telegraph\u2019s splash is \u201cBrexit will start green revolution, pledges PM\u201d, as Boris Johnson says that if re-elected his government will spearhead a drive to tackle climate change. We begin the day with some fighting words from Angela Rayner, who sat down with the Guardian\u2019s Heather Stewart yesterday. The shadow education secretary claimed Boris Johnson is \u201cin cahoots\u201d with Nigel Farage after the announcement that Brexit party candidates would stand aside in Conservative-held seats to help deliver Johnson a majority. \u201cNigel Farage is working in cahoots with Boris Johnson, trying to hoodwink the public \u2013 and they are very friendly with Donald Trump,\u201d Rayner told the Guardian. She warned voters, particularly in the Midlands and the north, to stick with Labour or risk \u201ca hard-right nasty Tory government, that will privatise and deregulate our markets \u2013 and they will make Margaret Thatcher look like a pussycat\u201d. Farage\u2019s deal with the Conservatives seems to have everyone up in arms today. The Conservatives are unhappy with him after Nigel Farage refused calls from Conservatives for the Brexit party to stand down in Labour marginal seats, saying the request was \u201calmost comical\u201d and that the Brexit party needed to get MPs into parliament to hold Boris Johnson\u2019s feet to the fire. On the other side of politics, there are ructions in the Liberal Democrats, after Tim Walker, the Lib Dem candidate for Canterbury, announced he would be stepping out of the race in order to give Rosie Duffield, the Labour candidate who took Canterbury from the Tories for the first time in 2017 by just 187 votes, the best chance of winning. Almost immediately afterwards, a party spokesman said Walker would be replaced \u201cin due course\u201d. But a local Lib Dem source said the party in Canterbury was vehemently opposed to replacing Walker and that all four members approved to stand as MPs had said they would not do so. And the former Tory minister David Gauke has announced he will stand as an independent candidate, saying he represents \u201c a form of liberal Conservatism\u201d and had become increasingly uncomfortable with the direction the Conservative party had taken regarding Brexit, saying \u201cthe Conservative party has got it badly wrong\u201d. Good morning and welcome to Politics live, as we bring you every tasty morsel of news during this election campaign. Johnson will relaunch the Conservatives\u2019 election campaign today, with a speech at an electric vehicle plant in the West Midlands, the first big set-piece speech of the campaign. In it, he will offer the familiar roll-call of core policies, including a pledge to \u201cend the groundhoggery of Brexit\u201d, spend more on the NHS and cut crime. Johnson will also attack Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party, saying a Labour government would condemn the UK to the \u201cintellectual cul-de-sac of far left Corbynism\u201d. The entry of the prime minister to the full electoral fray after a relatively quiet start to his campaign comes after his starring turn in an election video that sought to portray Boris Johnson as a man of the people, but which some viewers thought made him look more like David Brent. I\u2019ll be at the helm of the blog for the early hours, you can reach me on Twitter or via email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com). Thanks for reading.",

      "bodyText": "Rafael Behr (Tactical pacts won\u2019t turn this into a Brexit election, Journal, 13 November) says \u201cthe Tories and Labour will continue to dominate English politics\u201d. But only because of the distortions of the first-past-the-post electoral system, which no longer reflects the political geography of the country. Nor does the bizarre decision by ITV and the BBC to broadcast head-to-head interviews only with Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. This may have served when we had a more or less stable two-party system. But that started to disintegrate in the mid-1980s and has been almost destroyed in recent months by the stresses of Brexit and the plunge into extremism by the two \u201cmain\u201d parties. Jo Swinson\u2019s portrayal of herself as the Liberal Democrat candidate for prime minister may be ambitious, but is a valid claim and deserves respect. Apart from that, the nationalists cannot become a UK government, but so long as they send substantial numbers of MPs to Westminster, their views will affect parliamentary decision-making, and sophisticated English voters might take that into consideration as to how they cast their ballots. In addition, there are smaller groups and fragments of political opinion not encompassed by Labour or Tory, but even small numbers of independently minded or dissident MPs can change the decisions of parliament. Yet the BBC and ITV will not let us hear from any of them. Perhaps this a ploy by them, expecting that Johnson and Corbyn will prove themselves so unfit to be prime minister that, when they see them together, viewers will rush to find an alternative.

My father, a Fen farm manager and staunch Conservative, would sometimes declare \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as a good socialist\u201d. But he would invariably add \u201cexcept Tom Williams of course\u201d. I doubt the present environment secretary will be similarly praised by political opponents living in the Don Valley in the years to come. Gerrard Raven Teddington, London \u2022 You say in your editorial (Global heating means a wetter UK, so after the clean-up must come change, 13 November) that \u201clocal flood defence schemes, as well as land use and planning decisions, will rightly be scrutinised once the waters have retreated\u201d. A good place to start is the Environment Agency\u2019s 2010 Don catchment flood management plan. One of the key messages for the Doncaster sub-area reads: \u201cWe need to make better use of the washlands and flood storage. This involves protecting the storage areas and available floodplain around Doncaster, which provide a route for floodwater during larger floods.\u201d It seems that this advice has been widely ignored. Any inquiry has to establish whether the local authority encouraged building development or was powerless to oppose it.

The idea that we were happy with Europe is a joke. We clearly weren\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He said Labour\u2019s Brexit strategy \u2013 to renegotiate a deal and then hold a confirmatory referendum with an option on the ballot paper to remain \u2013 would cut through if it was expressed often enough and clearly enough. \u201cLabour\u2019s task is to get beyond Brexit and get on to issues that affect ordinary people on a day-to-day basis. I believe Labour can do that.\u201d</p> <p>He said members of Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet should not prejudge how they might campaign in a second referendum and must remain disciplined. \u201cI am calling on some members of the shadow cabinet who are passionate remainers that they shouldn\u2019t declare now which way they will campaign.\u201d</p> <p>McCluskey said: \u201cWe have to ask: why did so many people vote to leave? Too many of those who live in metropolitan political and media circles don\u2019t really grasp why people voted the way they did.\u201d</p> <p>He said one reason for the leave vote was deindustrialisation, with people living in the \u201cforgotten towns and cities\u201d not just asking \u201cwhat has Europe done for us\u201d but also keen to give the political elite \u201ca slap in the face\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe other reason was migrant labour coming to the UK from Europe.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s key union supporter, Unite\u2019s Len McCluskey, sparked a backlash on Tuesday as he told the Labour leader that victory in the general election means taking a tough line on free movement of workers. In a Guardian interview, the Unite general secretary said shadow cabinet members should not upset Labour\u2019s carefully crafted Brexit position during the election and that he would oppose any attempts to extend free movement as voted for at the party\u2019s annual conference in Brighton. \u201cWe will have to see what\u2019s in the manifesto, but I don\u2019t think [what conference voted for] is a sensible approach and I will be expressing that view,\u201d McCluskey said, adding that he was keen to shore up the party\u2019s support in marginal seats in the Midlands and north of England being targeted by Boris Johnson. With the Conservatives seeking to make migration a key election issue, McCluskey said Labour needed to show how it was going to prevent pay and conditions from being undercut before it could consider relaxing its stance. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong in my view to have any greater free movement of labour unless you get stricter labour market regulation.\u201d His intervention, ahead of Saturday\u2019s meeting to sign off the manifesto, infuriated activists who campaigned for the radical pro-migration motion passed at conference. Alena Ivanova, from the Labour Campaign for Free Movement, said: \u201cA Romanian care worker and a British bus driver have more in common with each other than they do with their boss. That is the basis of the trade union movement. Len MCluskey\u2019s job is to fight for their full rights, for decent pay and the right not to be deported and harassed by the state because of their immigration status.\u201d Several senior Labour figures privately expressed concern about McCluskey\u2019s approach and said they expected his view to prevail at Labour\u2019s manifesto meeting this weekend. \u201cLen has re-emerged as the flagbearer of the old Labour right. He\u2019s part of a backward-looking, small-c conservative nostalgia-tripping wing of the labour movement that wants \u2018trade union rights for British workers\u2019,\u201d warned one Labour candidate hoping to retain their remain-voting seat. Unite is Labour\u2019s biggest affiliate and will have considerable influence as the election manifesto is finalised over the coming days. In a wide-ranging interview, McCluskey said: Labour needed to get the election debate off Brexit and on to the day-to-day issues that really mattered to voters. The shadow cabinet should keep quiet about how it would campaign in the event of another referendum. White working-class supporters of leave in the 2016 referendum would be driven into the arms of a hard-right party unless their concerns about migration were dealt with. There would be no attempt to move Labour back to the centre if the party lost the election. He predicted paramilitary attacks on UK mainland ports as a result of the customs border down the Irish Sea that forms a key part of Johnson\u2019s Brexit withdrawal deal. McCluskey said his union had campaigned on a platform of remain and reform in the 2016 referendum. \u201cThe reform part was important. The idea that we were happy with Europe is a joke. We clearly weren\u2019t.\u201d He said Labour\u2019s Brexit strategy \u2013 to renegotiate a deal and then hold a confirmatory referendum with an option on the ballot paper to remain \u2013 would cut through if it was expressed often enough and clearly enough. \u201cLabour\u2019s task is to get beyond Brexit and get on to issues that affect ordinary people on a day-to-day basis. I believe Labour can do that.\u201d He said members of Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet should not prejudge how they might campaign in a second referendum and must remain disciplined. \u201cI am calling on some members of the shadow cabinet who are passionate remainers that they shouldn\u2019t declare now which way they will campaign.\u201d McCluskey said: \u201cWe have to ask: why did so many people vote to leave? Too many of those who live in metropolitan political and media circles don\u2019t really grasp why people voted the way they did.\u201d He said one reason for the leave vote was deindustrialisation, with people living in the \u201cforgotten towns and cities\u201d not just asking \u201cwhat has Europe done for us\u201d but also keen to give the political elite \u201ca slap in the face\u201d. \u201cThe other reason was migrant labour coming to the UK from Europe. If you don\u2019t understand those concerns, you fail to grasp the divisions that exist. Migrant workers are to blame for absolutely nothing in this country. They are just trying to better their lives and the lives of their families. It\u2019s the greedy bosses that are using them to undercut pay and conditions. \u201cIf we don\u2019t deal with the issues and concerns, we will create a vacuum that will be filled by a far right seeking to become the voice of the white working class.\u201d McCluskey said he did not agree with the view expressed by some on the left that complete free movement of capital should be matched by complete free movement of labour. \u201cThe only beneficiaries are the bosses of unscrupulous companies.\u201d Corbyn was challenged about McCluskey\u2019s comments on a campaign visit to Scotland, but declined to be drawn. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have our clause V meeting at the weekend and no doubt that issue is going to be discussed there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are massive job shortages in the NHS across the whole of the UK \u2013 I think there are something like 30,000 to 40,000 nurse vacancies \u2013 there\u2019s also a shortage of doctors across the whole of the NHS, and EU workers have made a massive contribution to our society.\u201d Labour could form the next government, McCluskey said, provided it could persuade leave and working-class voters that Labour was on their side. If people thought the Tories were suddenly going to remember the forgotten towns and stop the influx of cheap labour then they were living in \u201ccloud cuckoo land\u201d, he said. McCluskey said he expected Corbyn to be Britain\u2019s next prime minister but predicted there would be no drift back to the centre even if Johnson remained in Downing Street because nobody in the party was offering an alternative ideology to the leader\u2019s anti-austerity stance. \u201cI don\u2019t think there will be a retreat from the left. Jeremy Corbyn changed British politics forever four years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not expecting Jeremy to lose, but whoever comes after him and whenever that happens, it will be somebody committed to making Britain a fairer, juster country. The shift is for good.\u201d McCluskey said ports on the UK mainland such as Holyhead and Stranraer would be targets for loyalist paramilitaries as a result of a customs border in the Irish Sea that forms part of the withdrawal agreement negotiated with the EU. \u201cDo we have to wait for people to be blown up for someone to recognise this?\u201d",

Mmmm. You\u2019ve seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/oct/24/favourite-film-raging-bull\">Raging Bull</a>. I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s a touch of the raging bullshit to this, given that the Lib Dems would be restoring only some of the money their own government took away \u2013 a fact that hadn\u2019t gone unnoticed by some of the anti-austerity protesters outside.</p> <p>Pressed on the matter, Swinson would only say unclearly that the Lib Dems would be very clear about times when \u201cmistakes were made\u201d. Still, looked at on a trajectory reaching back beyond the coalition, it can\u2019t be denied that the party has turned its own life of crime around. One day at a time and all that. But, let\u2019s face it, any day the Liberal leadership doesn\u2019t order a homicide but settle for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/02/jeremy-thorpe-scandal-attempted-case-to-reopen\">canicide</a> is a win.</p> <p>The main thing Swinson would like you to think, as she jabbed for the cameras, is that she has that same lovable underdog energy of Rocky Balboa, being absolutely determined to show people she ain\u2019t some bum from the neighbourhood and has a chance of pulling off a million-to-one prime ministerial upset. \u201cI don\u2019t think either of them would be a good PM,\u201d she judged of Johnson and Corbyn. \u201cI could do a better job.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, to put it in terms Swinson would reflexively understand: if this were a cold war training montage, she would be doing pull-ups in a barn and outpacing KGB agents in the snow, while Johnson and Corbyn would be in a hi-tech gym getting dodgy injections off Brigitte Nielsen. Or, as she preferred it of Johnson and Corbyn, \u201cI look forward to taking them on in the debates \u2013 unless they\u2019re scared of taking on a girly swot.\u201d There it is again. You hear a lot about the fight game being the hardest game in the world. But it\u2019s got nothing on trying to get your party on the ITV debate ticket, and don\u2019t let anyone tell you different.</p>",

I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s a touch of the raging bullshit to this, given that the Lib Dems would be restoring only some of the money their own government took away \u2013 a fact that hadn\u2019t gone unnoticed by some of the anti-austerity protesters outside. Pressed on the matter, Swinson would only say unclearly that the Lib Dems would be very clear about times when \u201cmistakes were made\u201d. Still, looked at on a trajectory reaching back beyond the coalition, it can\u2019t be denied that the party has turned its own life of crime around. One day at a time and all that. But, let\u2019s face it, any day the Liberal leadership doesn\u2019t order a homicide but settle for a canicide is a win. The main thing Swinson would like you to think, as she jabbed for the cameras, is that she has that same lovable underdog energy of Rocky Balboa, being absolutely determined to show people she ain\u2019t some bum from the neighbourhood and has a chance of pulling off a million-to-one prime ministerial upset. \u201cI don\u2019t think either of them would be a good PM,\u201d she judged of Johnson and Corbyn. \u201cI could do a better job.\u201d Yes, to put it in terms Swinson would reflexively understand: if this were a cold war training montage, she would be doing pull-ups in a barn and outpacing KGB agents in the snow, while Johnson and Corbyn would be in a hi-tech gym getting dodgy injections off Brigitte Nielsen. Or, as she preferred it of Johnson and Corbyn, \u201cI look forward to taking them on in the debates \u2013 unless they\u2019re scared of taking on a girly swot.\u201d There it is again. You hear a lot about the fight game being the hardest game in the world. But it\u2019s got nothing on trying to get your party on the ITV debate ticket, and don\u2019t let anyone tell you different.",

      "body": "<p>The issue of disability rights has risen socially and culturally in recent years. Politically, however, disabled people remain in the shadows. Austerity has been brutal for disabled people.

Disabled people in Britain remain some of the most marginalised and forgotten people in British society.</p> <p>As the Brexit debate has raged on, silence has prevailed when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2017/aug/14/brexit-disability-rights-eu-legislation\" title=\"\">its implications for disabled people</a> \u2013 the challenges they are likely to face or the measures being put in place to mitigate fallout.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I urge everyone in politics to bring disabled people into your movements. You cannot legislate for what you do not know</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The European Accessibility Act of 2015 ensures that products and services are accessible to disabled people. This Act makes a vital difference to millions of people: what will happen to it when we leave? The European Social Fund currently gives \u00a3500m a year to organisations in the UK that provide employment and training support for disadvantaged groups including disabled people. MPs have warned that the loss of this fund could be \u201cdisastrous\u201d. What measures are there to reduce the damage?</p> <p>Even the Tory former care minister Caroline Dinenage admitted that \u201cno formal impact assessment\u201d had been carried out by her department to review the impact of a no-deal Brexit on disabled people.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.scope.org.uk/media/disability-facts-figures/\" title=\"\">government data</a>, there are 13.9 million disabled people in the UK. That means disabled people make up 22% of the UK population \u2013 more than one in five. Surely policies affecting the lives of so many people should be prioritised? With an election around the corner, politicians would be foolish to underestimate the voting power of such a large proportion of the population.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/26/benefit-assessor-more-afraid-state-poverty\">I had a visit from my benefits assessor \u2013 now I fear the state more than poverty | Rob Palk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Disabled and vulnerable people must not be left out when it comes to voting at this election. The postal vote helps those with accessibility issues, but it is also essential that disabled people are visible at polling stations, on election day, to promote inclusion. Plans must consider the weather challenges that come with a December election. There\u2019s now an agency responsible for publishing accessible versions of party manifestos and providing guidance for returning officers to make their polling stations accessible. Resources and infrastructure must be made available to ensure they do so.</p> <p>Growing up in Kenya, my family and I had to flee my village because the community thought my disability had brought a curse. They wanted to burn our house down. We are a long way from this in the UK, but disability <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/10/online-hate-against-disabled-people-rises-by-a-third\" title=\"\">hate crime is on the up</a>, and many disabled people are experiencing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/31/universal-credit-pushing-disabled-people-into-poverty\" title=\"\">poverty</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/23/loneliness-disabled-people-britain-isolation\" title=\"\">isolation</a>.</p> <p>One of the critical steps to real inclusion is the full representation of disabled people in political life \u2013 from representation in the electorate via accessible voting through to party membership and leadership roles. Disabled people must be in the room, on panels and in leadership teams.</p> <p>In a truly inclusive society, it would be the norm to see disabled people represented by and integrated into all areas of political life. Until this happens, our voices remain silent.</p> <p>I urge every person engaged in politics \u2013 from the community level to the national \u2013 to make sure you bring disabled people into your movements. Broaden your discussions. You cannot legislate for what you do not know. When society denies disabled people a voice and a platform in the decisions that affect our lives, we are left further and further behind. We need structural, systemic change. Disabled people must get proper access to all aspects of social life, and barriers must be broken down \u2013 physical barriers in our society, and mental barriers in people\u2019s assumptions about disability.</p> <p>We need to reimagine society, with disabled people moved from the shadows to be part of everyday life. Disabled people must be at the centre of discussions; their perspectives and solutions are urgently needed to make society inclusive and equitable. And that goes too for Brexit preparations, otherwise the rights of disabled people in the UK could be seriously and unfairly damaged.</p> <p>\u2022 Anne Wafula Strike is a British Paralympic wheelchair racer</p>",

      "bodyText": "The issue of disability rights has risen socially and culturally in recent years. Politically, however, disabled people remain in the shadows. Austerity has been brutal for disabled people. In 2017 the UN accused the government of violating disabled people\u2019s rights and causing a \u201chuman catastrophe\u201d. Disabled people in Britain remain some of the most marginalised and forgotten people in British society. As the Brexit debate has raged on, silence has prevailed when it comes to its implications for disabled people \u2013 the challenges they are likely to face or the measures being put in place to mitigate fallout. The European Accessibility Act of 2015 ensures that products and services are accessible to disabled people. This Act makes a vital difference to millions of people: what will happen to it when we leave? The European Social Fund currently gives \u00a3500m a year to organisations in the UK that provide employment and training support for disadvantaged groups including disabled people. MPs have warned that the loss of this fund could be \u201cdisastrous\u201d. What measures are there to reduce the damage? Even the Tory former care minister Caroline Dinenage admitted that \u201cno formal impact assessment\u201d had been carried out by her department to review the impact of a no-deal Brexit on disabled people. According to government data, there are 13.9 million disabled people in the UK. That means disabled people make up 22% of the UK population \u2013 more than one in five. Surely policies affecting the lives of so many people should be prioritised? With an election around the corner, politicians would be foolish to underestimate the voting power of such a large proportion of the population. Disabled and vulnerable people must not be left out when it comes to voting at this election. The postal vote helps those with accessibility issues, but it is also essential that disabled people are visible at polling stations, on election day, to promote inclusion. Plans must consider the weather challenges that come with a December election. There\u2019s now an agency responsible for publishing accessible versions of party manifestos and providing guidance for returning officers to make their polling stations accessible. Resources and infrastructure must be made available to ensure they do so. Growing up in Kenya, my family and I had to flee my village because the community thought my disability had brought a curse. They wanted to burn our house down. We are a long way from this in the UK, but disability hate crime is on the up, and many disabled people are experiencing poverty and isolation. One of the critical steps to real inclusion is the full representation of disabled people in political life \u2013 from representation in the electorate via accessible voting through to party membership and leadership roles. Disabled people must be in the room, on panels and in leadership teams. In a truly inclusive society, it would be the norm to see disabled people represented by and integrated into all areas of political life. Until this happens, our voices remain silent. I urge every person engaged in politics \u2013 from the community level to the national \u2013 to make sure you bring disabled people into your movements. Broaden your discussions. You cannot legislate for what you do not know. When society denies disabled people a voice and a platform in the decisions that affect our lives, we are left further and further behind. We need structural, systemic change. Disabled people must get proper access to all aspects of social life, and barriers must be broken down \u2013 physical barriers in our society, and mental barriers in people\u2019s assumptions about disability. We need to reimagine society, with disabled people moved from the shadows to be part of everyday life. Disabled people must be at the centre of discussions; their perspectives and solutions are urgently needed to make society inclusive and equitable. And that goes too for Brexit preparations, otherwise the rights of disabled people in the UK could be seriously and unfairly damaged. \u2022 Anne Wafula Strike is a British Paralympic wheelchair racer",

      "body": "<p>A message pings on my phone from a swing voter. This person was a remainer who accepted the referendum verdict, backed Theresa May in 2017, loathes Boris Johnson and thinks Jeremy Corbyn would ruin the country. The Liberal Democrats don\u2019t appeal and can\u2019t win locally. What to do?</p> \n<p>It is a commonplace dilemma, hardly worth sharing, except for the detail that this individual was a Tory cabinet minister not long ago. Something peculiar is going on with political identities when people who have served in government for the two biggest parties are at a loss as to how to vote.</p> \n<p>The Tories and Labour will continue to dominate English politics. They have the biggest campaign machines, and blue and red rosettes exert strong traditional gravity. But the public has also sniffed out something unfamiliar about their old parties, something pungent, a sweaty kind of mania. There is a new, wild glint about the eyes that provokes unease in the non-aligned citizen.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The nerds who monitor reshuffles as if they were football transfer windows relish an election. It is our world cup</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Most people are not party members. Only the eccentric few follow every twist of the debate. The nerds who monitor cabinet reshuffles as if they were football transfer windows relish an election. It is our world cup. But the rest see it more like a trip to the dentist, necessary but unwelcome. It is something that should happen regularly but not often; definitely not recreational. Those are the people who decide the result and, hard though it may be for the obsessives like me to accept, their perspective is often better than ours. Veteran campaigners know to respect the views of people who see politics out of the corner of their eye.</p> \n<p>The indigenous politicos of Westminster have already worked themselves into a frenzy, but millions of people are only just beginning to notice the election. I tagged along with a candidate in a leafy ward of Birmingham over the weekend and actual leaves \u2013 specifically the council\u2019s failure to sweep them up \u2013 were a much bigger issue on the doorstep than leaving the EU. When notified that an election was coming, no one was happy about the news. We did, after all, have one quite recently.</p> \n<p>Anyone who has tried canvassing on a chilly November afternoon knows that political campaigns are an intrusion of public argument into private lives. That is why Johnson prefaces every speech with the claim that he does not want an election. He says it has been forced on him by an obstructive parliament. The Conservatives are traumatised by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/19/electoral-commission-conservatives-spent-lost-majority-2017-election\" title=\"\">loss of their majority</a> in 2017. The postmortem on that campaign found many causes of death, and reaction against the perceived opportunism of holding the ballot at all was among them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f84407a7-9a31-4796-8c96-e2975da57cb9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-sVBM3Qym0Y?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Theresa May had previously ruled out a ballot because she wanted to get on with governing. That matched her image as a grownup prime minister, and having no election suited most people just fine. It was only a year after the referendum, which had felt like pulling teeth. The unravelling of May\u2019s brand began the moment she got greedy and tried to cash in her polling lead. It smelled wrong.</p> \n<p>Some of the 2017 surge in support for Labour must be attributed to Corbyn\u2019s campaign, and some was borrowed votes from Corbyn-sceptic remainers. But there was also an ill-defined but potent sense of collective reaction against Conservative hubris. The prime minister seemed to think she was entitled to victory, and the electorate reminded her who was boss. Party identities played their part, but so did a vaguer cultural tendency to disobedience and bloody-mindedness. Voters do not like to be taken for granted, or have their verdict prematurely allocated to one column or another. That human impulse to independence is lost on the would-be architects of electoral pacts and designers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/09/remain-united-tactical-voting-site-gina-miller\" title=\"\">tactical voting websites</a>.

      "bodyText": "A message pings on my phone from a swing voter. This person was a remainer who accepted the referendum verdict, backed Theresa May in 2017, loathes Boris Johnson and thinks Jeremy Corbyn would ruin the country. The Liberal Democrats don\u2019t appeal and can\u2019t win locally. What to do? It is a commonplace dilemma, hardly worth sharing, except for the detail that this individual was a Tory cabinet minister not long ago. Something peculiar is going on with political identities when people who have served in government for the two biggest parties are at a loss as to how to vote. The Tories and Labour will continue to dominate English politics. They have the biggest campaign machines, and blue and red rosettes exert strong traditional gravity. But the public has also sniffed out something unfamiliar about their old parties, something pungent, a sweaty kind of mania. There is a new, wild glint about the eyes that provokes unease in the non-aligned citizen. Most people are not party members. Only the eccentric few follow every twist of the debate. The nerds who monitor cabinet reshuffles as if they were football transfer windows relish an election. It is our world cup. But the rest see it more like a trip to the dentist, necessary but unwelcome. It is something that should happen regularly but not often; definitely not recreational. Those are the people who decide the result and, hard though it may be for the obsessives like me to accept, their perspective is often better than ours. Veteran campaigners know to respect the views of people who see politics out of the corner of their eye. The indigenous politicos of Westminster have already worked themselves into a frenzy, but millions of people are only just beginning to notice the election. I tagged along with a candidate in a leafy ward of Birmingham over the weekend and actual leaves \u2013 specifically the council\u2019s failure to sweep them up \u2013 were a much bigger issue on the doorstep than leaving the EU. When notified that an election was coming, no one was happy about the news. We did, after all, have one quite recently. Anyone who has tried canvassing on a chilly November afternoon knows that political campaigns are an intrusion of public argument into private lives. That is why Johnson prefaces every speech with the claim that he does not want an election. He says it has been forced on him by an obstructive parliament. The Conservatives are traumatised by the loss of their majority in 2017. The postmortem on that campaign found many causes of death, and reaction against the perceived opportunism of holding the ballot at all was among them. Theresa May had previously ruled out a ballot because she wanted to get on with governing. That matched her image as a grownup prime minister, and having no election suited most people just fine. It was only a year after the referendum, which had felt like pulling teeth. The unravelling of May\u2019s brand began the moment she got greedy and tried to cash in her polling lead. It smelled wrong. Some of the 2017 surge in support for Labour must be attributed to Corbyn\u2019s campaign, and some was borrowed votes from Corbyn-sceptic remainers. But there was also an ill-defined but potent sense of collective reaction against Conservative hubris. The prime minister seemed to think she was entitled to victory, and the electorate reminded her who was boss. Party identities played their part, but so did a vaguer cultural tendency to disobedience and bloody-mindedness. Voters do not like to be taken for granted, or have their verdict prematurely allocated to one column or another. That human impulse to independence is lost on the would-be architects of electoral pacts and designers of tactical voting websites. That doesn\u2019t mean seat-by-seat collusion is irrelevant, but I suspect its value is overstated. Nigel Farage\u2019s decision to withdraw Brexit party candidates from seats where the Tories are incumbent sends mixed national signals. It authenticates the prime minister as a Eurosceptic ultra, but that reinforces the feeling among ex-Tory remainers that Johnson\u2019s party is dead to them. And without a Brexit party candidate on the ballot, some leavers will default back to a lifelong habit of voting for Labour, sooner than endorse a Conservative. Choreography on the remain side is even messier. Even in the seats where pacts have been agreed between Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid Cymru, voters cannot be relied on to take dictation from on high. There are radical leftwing Greens who would rather switch to Labour (not actually a remain party) if their own candidate isn\u2019t listed. As for the notion that Labour and Lib Dems should come to a grand accommodation, it is as old as it is infertile. They are old rivals from different traditions with grudges at every level from the Commons chamber to council by-election. Even if individuals in certain seats could set bygones aside, at national level Jo Swinson needs support from liberal Tories who abhor Corbynism every bit as much as Brexit nationalism. Swinson cannot afford to give the faintest hint of formal collaboration with Labour under its current leader. Besides, there would be scant reciprocation.

Even Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, used to treat it as more of a long-term ideal than a realistic goal. But the Brexit vote in 2016 (arguably an English nationalist vote) has stirred up separatist sentiment in Wales as well as in Scotland, Plaid Cymru elected a new leader last autumn, <strong>Adam Price</strong>, much more committed to independence and now in Wales <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-49619554\">there now even marches for independence.</a></p> \n  <p>Today Price has announced that he has set up a commission to consider how an independent Wales could work. It will be chaired by Jocelyn Davis, a former minister in the Labour/Plaid Cymru coalition government in the Welsh assembly. Explaining what the commission would do, Price said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Something is happening in Wales. Over the past year, thousands have marched together in independence marches in Cardiff, Caernarfon and Merthyr. Polls show that around 30% consistently support independence. Independence has moved from the margins into the mainstream of Welsh political debate. </p> \n   <p>Our mission is to convince the people of Wales that independence is not merely desirable, but actually vitally necessary to tackle our problems and improve our standard of living. </p> \n   <p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m proud to announce that Plaid Cymru have set up a commission, chaired by the formidable Jocelyn Davies, to look at how Wales can become independent in the next decade. The arms-length commission will undertake extensive analysis and develop effective policy to carve a clear pathway to the independence we need as a nation. </p> \n   <p>This is a watershed moment in our country\u2019s history. Plaid Cymru believe that independence is the best choice for the people and communities of Wales. This commission will play a crucial part in proving that. It\u2019s time to declare a new Welsh spirit of independence and hope by refusing to put our faith in the Westminster establishment that has failed us for so long. It\u2019s time to choose a future that we ourselves will shape.

They want mobile operators to be given short-term targets for improving coverage, instead of post-2024 targets, and a continuous roll-out of broadband to reach full fibre by 2025. </p> \n  <p>Their other five demands are: changes to the planning system to make it easier to build homes, helping to solve the housing crisis; fast-tracking of the agriculture and environment bills, held up by Brexit, and a commitment to keep high welfare and environmental standards in farming; \u00a3200m a year investment in skills and training for farmers; and a simpler tax regime so that farmers who diversify into other businesses can file a single tax return, cutting red tape and saving them money.</p> \n  <p>Tory HQ has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/05/dont-sign-pledges-on-nhs-or-climate-tory-hq-tells-candidates\">forbidden</a> candidates to sign pledges on the climate emergency or the NHS, but a rural pledge might be a different matter.</p> \n  <p>Mark Bridgeman, incoming president of the CLA, said: \u201cAny future MP worth their salt should proudly back the campaign.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-12T14:53:34.047Z\">at 2.53pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dcac1ea8f08aab51e1bd938\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/richard-partington\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-12T14:34:14.649Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>John McDonnell </strong>has said Labour would hit the City of London and wealthier individuals with higher taxes to pay for the party\u2019s spending plans.</p> \n  <p>Dismissing Conservative claims that every taxpayer in Britain would need to pay \u00a32,400 more in tax under Labour (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/12/general-election-farage-under-pressure-to-withdraw-from-tory-labour-contests-live-news?page=with:block-5dca801e8f083361c70109d2#block-5dca801e8f083361c70109d2\">11.29am)</a> as \u201cfake news\u201d, the shadow chancellor said the party\u2019s manifesto would ramp up taxes on the top 5% of earners only. </p> \n  <p>Speaking at a protest for striking McDonalds workers outside Downing Street, calling for higher wages and union recognition at the US fast-food chain in Britain, he told the Guardian: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Ninety five per cent of the people would be protected against any increase in income tax as well as VAT.</p> \n   <p>You will see our taxation proposals that we will publish alongside our manifesto.

Jeremy Corbyn is due to pay a visit to Doncaster this afternoon.</p> \n  <p>Asked if the Lib Dems should cooperate more with Labour candidates in light of the Brexit party\u2019s \u201cunilateral leave alliance\u201d, Swinson said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019ve worked with Labour MPs who want to stop Brexit in parliament, but unfortunately the Labour leadership doesn\u2019t want to stop Brexit and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/07/lib-dems-greens-and-plaid-cymru-reveal-remain-election-pact\">when the Unite to Remain alliance was put together</a> they approached the Labour party who said absolutely not.</p> \n   <p>If you look at this election, the Liberal Democrats are the party best placed to win seats from the Conservatives.

But he also added Donald Trump, and escalated his warning about what might be at risk from a post-Brexit UK-US trade deal negotiated by a government led by Boris Johnson. Corbyn said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What we have before us is an alliance between Donald Trump and Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson. We know where that alliance is designed to take us \u2013 into a sweetheart trade deal with the United States that will threaten all of our regulations, all of our conditions, and threaten our public services ...</p> \n   <p>Farage and Johnson only offer division, division, division, and a deal with Donald Trump. You\u2019ll then be saying whatever happened to our wonderful national health service? Whatever happened to all the regulations that we had that protected our rights at work, our right to clean environment and our right to safe food. All of that is at risk from the kind of trade deal that they want to do with the USA. We will have none of it.</p> \n   <p>It is worth pointing out that Labour claims about what would happen under a UK-US trade deal are like Tory claims about Labour tax policy (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/12/general-election-farage-under-pressure-to-withdraw-from-tory-labour-contests-live-news?page=with:block-5dca801e8f083361c70109d2#block-5dca801e8f083361c70109d2\">11.29am)</a> \u2013 not facts, but predictions, based on assumptions of varying degrees of probability. US negotiators would try to put drug pricing on the table in trade talks, and their employment and food quality standards are looser than UK ones. But the Tory government has also said that it would not include the NHS or drug pricing in a trade deal and that it would not lower employment or food standards, and in practice a Johnson administration would be constrained to an extent by what was politically acceptable to the public.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f84407a7-9a31-4796-8c96-e2975da57cb9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-sVBM3Qym0Y?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn said that he was \u201cvery nervous\u201d at the thought that yesterday\u2019s cyber attack on Labour could be a foretaste of things to come. </strong>Asked about the attack, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have a system in place in our office to protect us against these cyber-attacks, but it was a very serious attack against us.

This isn\u2019t their fault. We will ensure every adult is supported to re-enter education, and we will give them the chance to gain the basic qualifications they need, whether that\u2019s at level 1, GCSE or through functional skills, so that nobody is locked out of work or other opportunities because they did not succeed in education the first time. And if they don\u2019t already have them, we will provide the funding for everyone to access A-levels, T-levels, or NVQs, whatever level 3 qualification is right for them. These are vital skills, necessary for working people across the country. But we cannot let this be the limit of our ambition. Our goal is a high skill, high wage economy fit for the challenges of the future.</p> \n   <p>Under the Tories, people are trapped in a low skill, low wage economy, unable to make ends meet. Addressing this challenge requires a revolution in our education system.

I\u2019m Alison Rourke and I\u2019ll be kicking off the day\u2019s news where Nigel Farage has made a significant entrance into proceedings. </p> \n  <p>After the Brexit party leader promised yesterday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/11/nigel-farage-urged-to-stand-aside-in-tory-target-seats-after-brexit-party-climbdown\">not to stand his candidates in the seats of sitting Conservative MPs</a>, senior Tories are now pushing for him to go one step further, and withdraw from contests in which the Conservatives are targeting Labour MPs. Farage claims his U-turn over standing candidates in the 317 Tory seats came after the PM released a video in which he pledged to go after a free-trade <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1193562889484951552\">\u201csuper-Canada-plus\u201d</a> style arrangement.</p> \n  <p>Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems say Farage\u2019s reversal points to a pact between him and Johnson over a secret hard-Brexit deal, something both have denied. </p> \n  <p>You can read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/11/nigel-farage-move-may-not-help-tories-as-much-as-it-first-appears\">Dan Sabbagh\u2019s analysis </a>of why Farage\u2019s move may not help the Tories as much as it first appears here. </p> \n  <p>Labour will announce its education pledge today, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/11/labour-pledge-we-would-give-six-years-of-free-study-for-adults\">including six years of free study for adults. </a> Under plans for a radical expansion of adult learning the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, will say any adult without without A-level or equivalent qualifications <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/11/labour-pledge-we-would-give-six-years-of-free-study-for-adults\">would be able to study for them for free at college</a>, with maintenance grants available for those on low incomes.</p> \n  <p>But as Fiona Millar writes, Labour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/nov/12/labour-still-asking-for-education-policy-ideas-here-are-a-few\">should be sweeping the floor with the Tories</a> who have \u201cbrought schools to their knees\u201d, but still seem to be stumbling, including just last week asking for education policy ideas.</p> \n  <p>Let\u2019s get started on the day. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-12T08:24:04.986Z\">at 8.24am GMT</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now. Thanks for reading and commenting. For a detailed rundown of the day\u2019s main events, see Andrew Sparrow\u2019s election briefing: And here\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s happened since he put that together earlier this evening: The former cabinet minister, David Gauke, announced he is to run as an independent. Gauke said it was necessary to prevent his former colleagues forming a government because of the damage their Brexit plan would likely cause. A Lib Dem candidate in a marginal Labour seat stood down. Tim Walker made the unilateral decision to avoid the \u201cnightmare\u201d of handing the constituency back to the Conservatives. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Rowena Mason and Denis Campbell have tonight\u2019s splash: The former justice and work and pensions secretary, David Gauke, will stand as an independent after losing the Conservative whip, he has said. Gauke has told the Times he wants to convince Tory supporters to prevent Boris Johnson pushing through a \u201cvery hard Brexit\u201d and said he will seek reelection as the MP for South West Hertfordshire. The paper quotes him as saying it would be \u201cno bad thing\u201d if \u201ctraditional, long-standing\u201d Conservative supporters backed the Lib Dems this time round, though he was careful to say he was best placed to stop the Tories in the constituency in which he\u2019s standing. In 2017, Gauke won more than half of the votes, taking the seat with a majority of nearly 20,000 on a turnout of only slightly more than 60,000. According to various correspondents in Westminster, he has acknowledged the news at an awards ceremony in London this evening: The SNP holding the balance of power in a hung parliament after the general election would be the \u201cbest\u201d outcome for Scotland, The SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has said. The first minister said such a scenario would put \u201cScotland into a powerful, influential position\u201d where the country\u2019s wishes could not be ignored by Westminster politicians. She has told a rally in Johnstone, in Renfrewshire, that \u201cgiven the need to make Scotland\u2019s voice heard ... the need to make sure Scotland\u2019s interests are to the fore, perhaps the best way of doing that is to have the SNP and SNP MPs holding the balance of power in a situation where neither of the main parties have an overall majority\u201d. Sturgeon added that this would put \u201cScotland into a powerful, influential position where we can make sure Scotland cannot be ignored\u201d. Fundamentally, the question here is who decides Scotland\u2019s future \u2013 is it Westminster, whether that is Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn? Do we leave Scotland in the position in general elections of having to cross our fingers and hope for the least worst alternative to emerge at the end of that process, or do we take our future into our own hands so we can guarantee we always get the governments we vote for, whoever they happen to be? She also revealed to she had spent had spent \u201ca fair bit of time\u201d considering her next steps if the UK\u2019s next prime minister refuses to grant her the power to hold a second Scottish independence referendum. If we are in that situation, all options will be considered. We\u2019re in an election campaign and if we reach that point, if we get to that bridge, I will set out then how I intend to cross that bridge. I think you can take for granted that I have spent a fair amount of time thinking about this over the past wee while. But I am not going to concede that point right now, I\u2019m certainly not going to concede that point at the early stage of an election campaign, because as soon as you concede that point, you kind of concede the right of Westminster to have a veto over Scotland\u2019s future.\u201d Earlier this evening, the BBC reported that the Tories had selected as a candidate a former MP who lost his seat after being convicted of submitting fake expenses documents. Chris Davies, formerly the MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, will now stand in Ynys M\u00f4n, the BBC said. Responding to the the news, the deputy leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Christine Humphreys, has said: Over 10,000 people signed the recall petition and decisively rejected Chris Davies at the ballot box in August because they had enough of an MP who put their constituency on the map for all the wrong reasons. By selecting Chris Davies to contest Ynys M\u00f4n, the Conservatives have demonstrated their utter contempt for the voters of Ynys M\u00f4n. This shows they can offer nothing more than an MP who has admitted to providing false information about his expenses claims. People deserve better, better than an MP who was rejected by his constituents and has fled his former constituency to seek election somewhere else. Voters should decisively reject Chris Davies at the ballot box on 12 December. Labour have responded to the Guardian\u2019s report on a dossier exposing more than two dozen sitting and former Conservative councillors for posting Islamophobic and racist material on social media (see 7.05pm). Naz Shah, the shadow equalities minister, has said: The Conservative party is rife with Islamophobia, racism and bigotry from top to bottom, but we have no faith that Boris Johnson will do anything about it. Johnson\u2019s comments about Muslim women looking like \u2018bank robbers\u2019 and \u2018letter boxes\u2019 were linked to a 375% rise in anti-Muslim hate crime, and polls show a majority of Conservative party members hold Islamophobic views. Boris Johnson must commit to a full independent inquiry into Islamophobia and stop pretending it doesn\u2019t exist in his party. When seeking the Tory leadership, Johnson promised to hold an external investigation into Islamophobia. He has not honoured that promise and a \u201cgeneral investigation\u201d into all types of discrimination. My colleague, Peter Walker, has this on the news that the Lib Dems plan to replace Tim Walker and fight for Canterbury (see 7.31pm): Labour have given short shrift to the government\u2019s announcement of greater flood relief efforts, saying they do not go far enough (see 7.28pm). Jon Trickett, the shadow minister for the cabinet office, has said: \u2018Too little, too late\u2019 isn\u2019t even the half of it. You can\u2019t trust Boris Johnson to look out for the North or the Midlands or protect our communities from flooding. But Labour will provide an extra \u00a35.6bn in flood defence funding, to level up flood defences over 10 years. Every home ruined and every business destroyed demands we act now. The Brexit party have hit back at Louis Steadman-Bryce after he quit as its general election candidate in Glasgow North East over Nigel Farage\u2019s decision to back out of fighting the Tories in hundreds of constituencies (see 7.04pm). The party\u2019s director of campaign strategy, Jack Irvine, has said: I don\u2019t understand Mr Steadman-Bryce\u2019s logic. Had Nigel Farage not announced that we wouldn\u2019t contest the 317 constituencies that the Tories won in 2017 there is every chance we would be looking at a far-left, Corbyn government that will keep us trapped in the EU indefinitely. Louis is a successful businessman and passionate Brexiteer. Is that really what he wants? Having been lucky enough to have \u201cbumped into\u201d the prime minister just as he was mulling over his love for fish and chips and why, exactly, we\u2019re having this election, the Tories have put out this campaign video: And, almost immediately, the prime minister has come in for criticism for making what Labour claim is a series of false claims \u2013 including that they would hold referendums on both Brexit and Scottish independence in 2020 if Corbyn got in to No 10 next month. Andrew Gwynne, Labour\u2019s co-national campaign coordinator, has said: Boris Johnson can\u2019t seem to open his mouth without misleading people, whether it\u2019s on the state of our economy or the shameful lack of investment in our public services. You can\u2019t trust a word he says. In contrast, Labour is running the most radical, people-focused election campaign our country has ever seen. It is time for real change after a decade of cuts and neglect under the Tories. The former chancellor, Philip Hammond, has found a job worth about \u00a3125,000 a year within a week of stepping down as an MP. He has become a non-executive director of Irish metal and glass packaging firm Ardagh, which is listed on the New York stock exchange. The firm said Hammond had joined its board and would serve on its audit committee, which oversees financial reporting and disclosure. The Lib Dems intend to replace Walker and contest the Canterbury seat, a party spokesman has said. The Liberal Democrat candidate in a marginal Labour seat has unilaterally decided to stand down, saying that while the two parties could not agree on a pact he wanted to avoid the \u201cnightmare\u201d of handing the constituency back to the Conservatives. In an article for the Guardian, Tim Walker said that while he did not trust Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit, he wanted to give Rosie Duffield, the Labour candidate who took Canterbury from the Tories for the first time in 2017 by just 187 votes, the best chance of winning. The announcement of his candidacy had dismayed some Lib Dems, who argued that while there is no formal deal between their party and Labour it would be better to stand aside to help Duffield, who is strongly pro-remain. In 2017 the then-Lib Dem candidate received more than 4,500 votes. An additional 100 armed forces personnel will be sent to flood-affected areas following today\u2019s Cobra meeting, No 10 has said. Boris Johnson convened the emergency meeting five days after the flooding hit parts of northern England and the Midlands after calls to do some from the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. The prime minister had earlier said the flooding was not sufficient to be defined as a \u201cnational emergency\u201d. Following the meeting, Johnson said: The recent flooding has had a devastating effect on people and businesses and it\u2019s essential that our communities have the support they need to recover. We\u2019re announcing this funding to support households and businesses get back on their feet. I want to express my deep gratitude to the emergency services, armed forces, Environment Agency and local authorities across the country who have responded to the flooding with distinction. The government announced that, under the flood recovery framework, it will \u201cprovide funding to support the recovery efforts of local councils where households and businesses have been affected\u201d. No 10 has said: The Ministry of Housing Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) will provide a community recovery grant to local councils \u2013 equivalent to \u00a3500 per eligible household - to help communities with their immediate recovery. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) will provide funding for a business recovery grant, which will provide up to \u00a32,500 per eligible small and medium-sized businesses which have suffered severe impacts from the floods that cannot be recovered from insurance. The UK Standby Battalion, based in Catterick, will be deployed from tomorrow. Twenty-five sitting and former Conservative councillors have been exposed for posting Islamophobic and racist material on social media, according to a dossier obtained by the Guardian that intensifies the row over anti-Muslim sentiment in the party. The disclosure that 15 current and 10 former Tory councillors have posted, shared or endorsed Islamophobic or other racist content on Facebook or Twitter will increase pressure on Boris Johnson after he backtracked on a pledge to hold an independent inquiry into the issue. Inflammatory posts recorded in the dossier, which has been sent to the party\u2019s headquarters, include calls for mosques to be banned, claims the faith wants to \u201cturn the world Muslim\u201d, referring to its followers as \u201cbarbarians\u201d and \u201cthe enemy within\u201d. The Brexit party\u2019s Scottish MEP, Louis Stedman-Bryce, has quit as its general election candidate after Nigel Farage announced the party would not contest seats held by the Conservatives. Stedman-Bryce was planning to stand in Glasgow North East, a Labour marginal seat won at the last election by Paul Sweeney with a very narrow majority of 242. No pro-Brexit party has yet stood in that seat, although the British National party has twice contested it, and twice lost its deposit. One of Scotland\u2019s few black political representatives, Stedman-Bryce won the Brexit party\u2019s only seat in Scotland in the May European elections with nearly 15% of the vote after it capitalised on a surge in pro-Brexit sympathies, replacing Ukip which had won a seat in 2014. He tweeted that Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal would be a disaster for the UK and should be resisted: Farage announced on Monday that his party was no longer going to contest 317 seats being defended by the Tories, focusing instead on Labour seats around the UK. Stedman-Bryce\u2019s resignation as a candidate in Glasgow North East will have little impact on the result there, since that contest is a straight fight between Labour and the SNP. The Brexit party is also expected to stand candidates in SNP-defended constituencies, a move likely to lower the odds of the Tories winning in the hyper-marginal seat of Perth and North Perthshire. The Tories were 21 votes short of taking the seat off the SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart in 2017 and hope this year to displace him. The BBC has reported that the former Ukip and Brexit party MEP in Scotland, David Coburn, has called on Farage to stand down all the party\u2019s candidates in Scotland to \u201cgive the Conservatives a good run at things\u201d. Coburn said: We want to make sure we do not let the SNP in and all [the Brexit party] are going to do is divide the vote \u2013 especially the Brexit vote. Sticking with Swinson\u2019s efforts to win round Welsh voters, she has launched the Welsh Liberal Democrats\u2019 campaign on the steps of the Senedd, the assembly building, in Cardiff today. The Lib Dems have a five-point plan in Wales \u2013 with stopping Brexit at the top of the agenda, but they are also focusing on issues such as the climate emergency, teacher recruitment and mental health. Swinson was also keen to highlight the number of women the party has on the team in Wales and argued that this could attract more female voters. However, the Lib Dems only had one Welsh MP in the last election: Jane Dodds, who won the byelection in Brecon and Radnorshire in the summer. As a whole, Wales voted to leave the EU. Swinson\u2019s party has an agreement with Plaid Cymru and the Greens to put up only one remain candidate in 11 of the 40 seats. But the Lib Dems and Plaid are keenly fighting the marginal seat of Ceredigion in west Wales, where both believe they have a good chance of a win. Swinson has said: We have a strong team of women in Wales. Our politics could do with more women at all levels; especially in leadership roles. We live in a society that is still very far from being equal in terms of gender. When you have a lot of women in political roles a wider range of issues gets talked about. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t value the contribution of our male colleagues but you notice a different tone of debate when you have more diverse voices. On Brexit, she has said: There are huge number of people here in Wales who want to stay in the EU, not least those who voted to leave but now want to remain. This is an opportunity for people to say we want to stop Brexit. This may be the last chance for them to do that. And, referring to the remain alliance, she has said: Ceredigion is a very close seat and ourselves and Plaid Cymru are having a lively campaign there. We have been able to work constructively in other seats. I\u2019m very proud we\u2019ve been able to come to that agreement. This is not a normal election. It\u2019s about the future of our country, who we are as a country. The Lib Dems say their five-point plan in Wales is to... Stop Brexit and invest a \u00a350bn \u201cremain bonus\u201d in public services and tackling inequality. Tackle the climate emergency by providing enough money to insulate every home by 2030 to cut emissions, prioritising all fuel-poor homes by 2025. Give every child the best start in life by recruiting more teachers, as part of an extra \u00a3560m for schools. Build a fair economy with opportunity for all by providing universal free childcare, and delivering a right to lifelong learning by investing in skills people need throughout their lives. Transform mental health by providing enough money for the Welsh NHS to treat it with the same urgency as physical health. It will be \u201cvery difficult\u201d to conclude a tariff and quota-free trade deal by the end of 2020, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister Simon Coveney has said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible \u2026 I think the timeline will be very tight,\u201d he told reporters in Dublin. Coveney also pointed out that some trade deals have taken up to a year to ratify, not to mention negotiate. Canada\u2019s deal with the EU took seven years to negotiate and member states took 11 months to ratify it. He\u2019s best known for standing outside parliament shouting \u201cstop Brexit\u201d over live broadcasts. Now, Steve Bray is now going to be a Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate in the Welsh constituency, Cynon Valley. The party\u2019s leader, Jo Swinson, has insisted Bray should not be seen as a joke candidate, adding: Our candidates are chosen by local and national parties, so the constituency will have chosen Steve as a candidate. He is a Liberal Democrat member and he is a passionate campaigner. He has been well-known within the remain cause more widely and I am sure he will bring that energy to the campaign here in Wales. Asked how she would respond to people who might not take his candidacy seriously, Swinson said: I would respectfully say that I disagree and he is somebody who is true to his values and cares very deeply. I think we do want to have our politicians care about the issues that they are addressing. I think Steve is an example of somebody who very clearly does just that. Bray has gained the nickname \u201cMr No Brexit\u201d for his longrunning demonstration. In October, he told the Observer his protest began online, before he decided to move it to College Green: Labour plans to complain to the broadcast regulator, Ofcom, over Sky News\u2019 branding of the upcoming vote as the \u201cBrexit election\u201d. The party believes that is tied too closely to what it sees as a Conservative strategy to focus the campaigning on Brexit. Officials have been making representations directly to Sky News in recent days but feel that route has now been exhausted. A Labour source has said: This does the Tories\u2019 work for them, effectively ensuring their Brexit election slogan is on screen and all over social media all day, every day. It\u2019s for voters to decide what\u2019s important to them, and this election is about more than one issue and about the real change we need after a decade of cuts under the Tories and Lib Dems. The news was first reported by HuffPost UK this evening. It is worth noting, however, that the prime minister has sought to include NHS funding and other issues he\u2019s described as the \u201cpeople\u2019s priorities\u201d in his campaigning. A Channel 4 election debate was scrapped because the chancellor, Sajid Javid, was \u201cterrified\u201d and refused to take part, according to the man who was due to face him; John McDonnell. In a video posted on Twitter, the shadow chancellor has claimed: We\u2019ve just heard that Sajid Javid has pulled out of the debate that had been planned on television this weekend. I know why: because he\u2019s terrified of debating the truth about Labour\u2019s policies. He\u2019s been putting forward silly, fictitious, fake news figures that we will rip apart. Let\u2019s make it absolutely clear: we\u2019ll be bringing forward our manifesto, it\u2019ll be fully costed, all the funding sources identified. And, yes, only the top 5% of earners will pay a bit more income tax, 95% of our people will not pay any increase in income tax or VAT or national insurance. So, come on chancellor \u2013 come and debate the real truth of Labour\u2019s policies. Boris Johnson has claimed that the situation is \u201cstabilising\u201d for those affected by the flooding in northern England, as he spoke to broadcasters after chairing a meeting of the government\u2019s Cobra emergency committee to consider the situation. He rejected claims that the government had been complacent in its handling of the matter. But No 10 only announced the Cobra meeting after Jeremy Corbyn publicly called for one (although Downing Street says it was scheduled anyway), and Corbyn and the Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson both made personal visits today to residents affected. During his visit Corbyn said Labour would spend \u00a35.6bn over 10 years improving flood defences Jeremy Corbyn has unveiled what he described as one of Labour\u2019s most transformative plans - a lifelong learning proposal that he said would give every adult an entitlement to six years of free education. This plan will delivered by Labour\u2019s national education service, and the proposals will be based on ideas set out in a report (pdf) from the party\u2019s lifelong learning commission. At a launch in Blackpool Corbyn said that this was one of the party\u2019s plans he was \u201cmost excited about\u201d. Although he announced the plan at the event, he left it to Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, to outline most of the details. Rayner said that people taking up the party\u2019s offer (up to six years\u2019 free study for qualifications up to level 4-6) would be able to get the same maintenance support available to students in higher education. And workers would have the right to paid time-off for study, she said. Rayner\u2019s speech was powerful because she was able to recount how, as a teenage mum, her own life was transformed by adult education and her performance will do nothing to quell speculation that, if she is not setting up a national education service after the election (and the polls continue to imply she won\u2019t be), she might be running for the leadership instead. Corbyn told reporters at the event that British voters were now at risk from a Trump/Farage/Johnson alliance that would threaten the NHS, workers\u2019 rights and safe food. Labour has described a Tory claim that personal taxes would go up by \u00a32,400 a head under a Jeremy Corbyn government as \u201cfake news\u201d. It is. The costings on which the claim is based are flawed, making it even more dubious than these election projections normally are. Nigel Farage has branded Conservative calls for the Brexit party to stand down in Labour marginals as \u201calmost comical\u201d, saying his party needs to get MPs into parliament to hold Boris Johnson\u2019s feet to the fire. But Farage has also faced a backlash from with some of the Brexit party candidates asked to stand down, with one candidate saying he only learned the news when a passing driver asked him why he was still campaigning. Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Jeremy Corbyn have led tributes to Frank Dobson, the former Labour health secretary, who has died at the age of 79. An MP for 36 years, socialist, campaigner, loyalist, wit and raconteur, he was widely admired, and even more widely liked. Labour\u2019s Anna Turley, who is suing the union Unite, has told the high court that the party has moved too far to the left under Jeremy Corbyn and has refused to apologise for insulting the union\u2019s leader, Len McCluskey. The Labour party has faced a second cyber-attack in two days, a day after experiencing what it called a \u201csophisticated and large-scale\u201d attempt to disrupt its digital systems. Labour has responded to a backlash among voters of Indian heritage in the UK by shifting its stance on the Kashmir dispute and insisting it is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan in which Labour will not interfere. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is writing the blog now. Johnson adds that he\u2019s concerned some people are not heeding the authorities\u2019 advice and calls on them to evacuate when they\u2019re told that do so is necessary. He denies political opponents\u2019 accusations that a disproportionate amount of money is being spent in south-east England than in the north and the Midlands, saying the \u201cwhole country is protected\u201d. Since a political point has been raised, Johnson says, he feels he should respond by pointing out the Tories\u2019 public sector spending plans. The prime minister is delivering a briefing after the Cobra meeting on the flooding that hit parts of England last week. He\u2019s asked why he has only just convened it now \u2013 five days after the crisis started. He does not answer that directly, instead saying he visited Derbyshire and that, in all, 850 homes have been flooded and about 3,000 people have been evacuated. He says things \u201cperhaps are stabilising\u201d but that waterlogged ground means we need to prepare for the possibility of more flooding this winter. Boris Johnson adds that he is looking into where the army might be able to help and he adds that the \u201cEnvironment Agency hasn\u2019t done too bad a job\u201d but there\u2019s no room for \u201ccomplacency\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn has been visiting a site of flooding in Doncaster, eight miles from where the Lib Dem leader made her visit earlier in the day. He used the visit to announce Labour\u2019s plans for a new \u00a35.6bn fund to level up flood defences over 10 years, funded through the party\u2019s \u00a3250bn \u201cgreen transformation fund\u201d. The Labour leader was shown around Custom Windows and Doors in Bentley that has become the site of a community effort to help people affected by the floods back on their feet, with piles of donations of clothes and food. Asked whether politicians were guilty of taking advantage of the disaster in south Yorkshire, Corbyn said the policy announcement was necessary. He said: I think it is appropriate that we say so, so people understand we are very serious about providing the resources necessary to deal with what are the personal and human disasters of floods. Emma King, 36, showed Corbyn around the home she lives in with her three children and partner. Her house was flooded on Friday and she said it now smelled like \u201cstale, rotten fish\u201d. King\u2019s house was last flooded in 2007. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have happened again,\u201d she said. \u201cDefences should have been put up.\u201d \u201cOh isn\u2019t he a lovely man,\u201d said added, looking on at Corbyn admiringly as he gave media interviews outside her house. Here is Neil Kinnock\u2019s tribute to Frank Dobson. Frank was sharply bright, tenacious, irreverently funny, blunt, a great team player, a strong democratic socialist and a remorseless foe of racism. His instincts and capacities would have made him an outstanding health secretary but, after just 18 months, he was talked into running for London mayor by appeals to his loyalty. Others would have been soured by the way in which he was then treated, but he rose above rancour and continued energetically to serve the Labour cause and his constituency. He will be greatly missed by his beloved family and his countless friends who valued his wisdom, rationality, fidelity to principles and comrades and uproarious humour. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, returned to his father\u2019s old shop in Bristol and described how his family had to \u201cwatch every single penny\u201d when living there, the Press Association reports. The PA story about Javid\u2019s visit goes on: Javid walked down Stapleton Road, previously described as Britain\u2019s most dangerous street, during a visit to the city on Tuesday afternoon. He walked into BS5 Flooring, situated at 307-309 Stapleton Road, telling staff who took over the shop on November 1: \u201cI used to live here above the shop - can I have a look?\u201d The chancellor walked up a set of stairs and went to a door leading to the flat where he had lived with family for five years, leaving when he was aged 12. Back outside the shop, he pointed to a billboard hanging in front of where his childhood bedroom used to be and told how his father, Abdul, sold ladies\u2019 clothing at the shop. Javid described those in the area as hard-working, aspirational people who wanted to do the best for their families. \u201cEvery time I come back here, it gives me very fond memories,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a wonderful childhood here. There was a lot in material terms that we didn\u2019t have but that didn\u2019t matter because there was so much in terms of human wealth here. \u201cIt is nice to be back. I popped in a shop I used to live above and its nice to see another business has just moved in here. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see the community is still thriving.\u201d YouGov has released some new polling, intended to take into account the impact of the Brexit party not standing in Tory-held seats, that gives the Conservatives a 14-point lead over the Labour. As with all polling, it may not tell you precisely what would happen if there were an election tomorrow - but it\u2019s a lot better than guessing. This is from the Times\u2019 Matt Chorley. Boris Johnson will shortly be recording a clip for broadcasters about this afternoon\u2019s Cobra meeting about the flooding. Labour has suffered a second cyber attack, the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar reports. In a blog the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush has more information about what happened in the first one. I\u2019m reliably informed by multiple sources that the cyberattack on Labour targeted Contact Creator \u2013 the system that holds information about where voters are and whether or not they say they will support the party \u2013 and the party\u2019s fundraising information and software, two vital parts of its campaigning infrastructure. That points to its relative sophistication, but does not give us a clear sense of whether it was a state actor, a politically motivated and tech-savvy individual with a grudge, or someone hoping to make money or cause mischief for the fun of it. What matters in this instance is that Labour\u2019s defences held up pretty well \u2013 that\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that someone, for some reason, has launched the first major cyberattack on a political party in the United Kingdom \u2013 and that the political discourse around what happened has been sorely lacking. Liz Evenden-Kenyon, the Lib Dem candidate in Boris Johnson\u2019s constituency, Uxbridge and South Ruislip, has announced that she is standing down for personal reasons (an illness in her family). She says she expects the party to select another candidate before nominations close on Thursday. The European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, has said he has \u201cdoubts\u201d that a trade deal can be negotiated in under a year as claimed by the UK when \u201cin other cases it takes five, seven or nine years\u201d. Speaking to the European parliament\u2019s committee on constitutional affairs, Verhofstadt said: I can confirm the doubts that I have that in one year you will do what you need. For example, [it took] nine years with Canada. An FTA with Britain is even more complicated as the interests at stake are more important, the trade is more important with the UK. Boris Johnson claims that he would be able to negotiate a trade deal by the end of next year, and on that basis he has ruled out extending the transition period beyond December 2020 - a statement that helped persuade Nigel Farage not to stand Brexit party candidates in Tory-held seats. Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister, also said today that the solution on Northern Ireland in the revised withdrawal agreement was the concept proposed by the EU \u201con day one\u201d of the talks with the UK. He said that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the political declaration on the future relationship as it was \u201cless ambitious\u201d than the document agreed with Theresa May. He said that the May version had included an \u201cassociation agreement\u201d with a \u201clarge number of [areas of] cooperation\u201d while the latest declaration provides for a \u201cdownsized free trade agreement\u201d. Verhofstadt said that the scope of the trade agreement would be determined by the UK commitment to keep up with EU standards on workers\u2019 rights, environmental standards and taxation. He said: We have described a level playing field in the new political declaration saying this free trade agreement will be broad if there is an acceptance by the UK side of the level playing field in the broadest sense. The text of the political declaration is more narrow than the previous text but it safeguards that, whatever the scope of the FTA, it will be in relation to the acceptance by the UK side of level playing field in standards and our regulations in the union. Survation has published some new polling figures today. Most recent polls have given the Conservative party a very large lead over Labour - the Guardian poll tracker, which averages all polls over the last two weeks, has the Tories 12 points ahead - but this Survation survey has the Conservatives just six points ahead. Of course, at the last two general elections the polls did not provide a reliable guide to the final - although in other elections they have turned out to be fairly accurate. Yesterday a separate ICM poll put the Conservatives eight points ahead of Labour. According to Labour, a proposed TV debate between the chancellor, Sajid Javid, and his Labour shadow, John McDonnell, that was scheduled for Sunday 17 November has been shelved. Ed Davey and Kirsty Blackman, the Lib Dem and SNP Treasury spokespeople respectively, were also invited to the 90-minute programme on Channel 4. Labour says it has now been told the debate will not go ahead because Javid won\u2019t participate. I\u2019ve asked the Conservatives for a comment and have been told someone will get back to me. I\u2019ll post their reply when I get it. For many years Welsh independence was never seen as a particularly serious proposition. Even Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, used to treat it as more of a long-term ideal than a realistic goal. But the Brexit vote in 2016 (arguably an English nationalist vote) has stirred up separatist sentiment in Wales as well as in Scotland, Plaid Cymru elected a new leader last autumn, Adam Price, much more committed to independence and now in Wales there now even marches for independence. Today Price has announced that he has set up a commission to consider how an independent Wales could work. It will be chaired by Jocelyn Davis, a former minister in the Labour/Plaid Cymru coalition government in the Welsh assembly. Explaining what the commission would do, Price said: Something is happening in Wales. Over the past year, thousands have marched together in independence marches in Cardiff, Caernarfon and Merthyr. Polls show that around 30% consistently support independence. Independence has moved from the margins into the mainstream of Welsh political debate. Our mission is to convince the people of Wales that independence is not merely desirable, but actually vitally necessary to tackle our problems and improve our standard of living. That\u2019s why I\u2019m proud to announce that Plaid Cymru have set up a commission, chaired by the formidable Jocelyn Davies, to look at how Wales can become independent in the next decade. The arms-length commission will undertake extensive analysis and develop effective policy to carve a clear pathway to the independence we need as a nation. This is a watershed moment in our country\u2019s history. Plaid Cymru believe that independence is the best choice for the people and communities of Wales. This commission will play a crucial part in proving that. It\u2019s time to declare a new Welsh spirit of independence and hope by refusing to put our faith in the Westminster establishment that has failed us for so long. It\u2019s time to choose a future that we ourselves will shape. It\u2019s time to choose our independence. The National Cyber Security Centre has said that it regards the cyber-attack on Labour as an incident that is now closed. In a statement it said: The NCSC has worked closely with political parties for several years on how to protect and defend against cyber-attacks. We met the major parties last week ahead of the general election. In terms of this incident, the Labour party followed the correct, agreed procedures and notified us swiftly. The NCSC is confident the party took the necessary steps to deal with the attack. The attack was not successful and the incident is now closed. The incoming president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has sent a second letter to Boris Johnson seeking a British nominee for the new commission by the end of the week after Downing Street missed a previous EU deadline. The prime minister had already been asked to provide a name by Monday but the deadline came and went without any word from the UK government. A spokeswoman for the commission said that Von der Leyen had sent a \u201creminder\u201d on Tuesday morning of the UK\u2019s obligations under the EU treaties and they expected a response \u201cat any rate by the end of this week\u201d. The spokeswoman said: Time is running out. This is why the president-elect is expecting an answer very soon to this second letter. A UK government spokesman said the letter had been received and a response was being considered. There would have been no obligation on the UK to nominate a commissioner if it had left the EU on 31 October as originally planned, but Johnson\u2019s decision to accept a Brexit extension - in accordance with the Benn act, and despite Johnson\u2019s repeated claims that he would never agree to a delay - means the UK is now obliged to nominate someone. In normal general elections, the rural vote is reliably Tory in most of England. But while many farmers are in favour of Brexit, the disappearance of EU subsidies with only Boris Johnson\u2019s word to guarantee future government support is worrying some, while the prospect of EU import tariffs on UK-produced food and floods of cheap imports has spooked the NFU. A no-deal Brexit, even if delayed under a Johnson government to the end of next year, could spell disaster for thousands of rural businesses. This time, the Conservatives may have to make more of a play for the 9.5 million voters who live in the countryside. Today, the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), representing 30,000 landowners and rural businesses, is writing to all prospective MPs to ask them to sign up to a five-point plan for a \u201crural powerhouse\u201d, along the lines of the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d promised by previous governments. Top of their list of demands is connectivity: rural broadband, long a bugbear of country-dwellers, and mobile phone coverage. They want mobile operators to be given short-term targets for improving coverage, instead of post-2024 targets, and a continuous roll-out of broadband to reach full fibre by 2025. Their other five demands are: changes to the planning system to make it easier to build homes, helping to solve the housing crisis; fast-tracking of the agriculture and environment bills, held up by Brexit, and a commitment to keep high welfare and environmental standards in farming; \u00a3200m a year investment in skills and training for farmers; and a simpler tax regime so that farmers who diversify into other businesses can file a single tax return, cutting red tape and saving them money. Tory HQ has forbidden candidates to sign pledges on the climate emergency or the NHS, but a rural pledge might be a different matter. Mark Bridgeman, incoming president of the CLA, said: \u201cAny future MP worth their salt should proudly back the campaign.\u201d John McDonnell has said Labour would hit the City of London and wealthier individuals with higher taxes to pay for the party\u2019s spending plans. Dismissing Conservative claims that every taxpayer in Britain would need to pay \u00a32,400 more in tax under Labour (see 11.29am) as \u201cfake news\u201d, the shadow chancellor said the party\u2019s manifesto would ramp up taxes on the top 5% of earners only. Speaking at a protest for striking McDonalds workers outside Downing Street, calling for higher wages and union recognition at the US fast-food chain in Britain, he told the Guardian: Ninety five per cent of the people would be protected against any increase in income tax as well as VAT. You will see our taxation proposals that we will publish alongside our manifesto. It will be fully-costed. The reality is that working people will be protected but the City and wealthy people and corporations will pay a bit more. The shadow chancellor attacked McDonalds for a \u201clong history of exploitative employment\u201d and failing to pay enough tax in Britain. They\u2019re one of those companies that makes large amounts of profits and then doesn\u2019t pay their workers properly and don\u2019t pay their taxes effectively. It\u2019s one of the things we\u2019ll clamp down on. From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh Here is my colleague Rowena Mason\u2019s story about the death of the former Labour health secretary Frank Dobson, which includes tributes to him from Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. And here are some more tributes. From Jeremy Corbyn From Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary From Matt Hancock, the Conservative health secretary From Charlie Falconer, the former Labour lord chancellor From the writer and Labour activist John O\u2019Farrell From Karen Buck, the Labour candidate for Westminster North From the Labour former cabinet minister Yvette Cooper From Rushanara Ali, Labour candidate in Bethnal Green and Bow From Nick Smith, Labour candidate in Blaenau Gwent From the former Labour MP Michael Dugher From David Lammy, Labour candidate for Tottenham From Stella Creasy, Labour candidate for Walthamstow Jo Swinson has been paying a visit to the Doncaster charity Stainforth4All, speaking to volunteers who have rallied to help victims of the recent flooding. They showed the Lib Dem leader the piles of clothes and supplies donated by locals and said they were appalled that the prime minister hadn\u2019t declared a national emergency. \u201cI visited Fishlake [an area badly affected by the flooding] and it broke my heart,\u201d said Rosemarie Squires through tears. Swinson used the visit to pledge a \u00a35bn flood defence fund that local authorities would be able to apply to improve their area\u2019s protections. Asked if politicians were guilty of exploiting the flooding in south Yorkshire, she said: I think it\u2019s important, whether there\u2019s an election or not, when things like this happen, for leaders to come and listen and to understand what is happening in communities. Swinson insisted that she would have visited the area even if there hadn\u2019t been an upcoming election, but that the media attention that came with the campaign could increase national awareness. Jeremy Corbyn is due to pay a visit to Doncaster this afternoon. Asked if the Lib Dems should cooperate more with Labour candidates in light of the Brexit party\u2019s \u201cunilateral leave alliance\u201d, Swinson said: I\u2019ve worked with Labour MPs who want to stop Brexit in parliament, but unfortunately the Labour leadership doesn\u2019t want to stop Brexit and when the Unite to Remain alliance was put together they approached the Labour party who said absolutely not. If you look at this election, the Liberal Democrats are the party best placed to win seats from the Conservatives. The Labour party is way down in the polls compared to two years ago. They are going to be struggling to hold on to the seats that they have. They\u2019re not going to be winning seats from the Tories. The Lib Dems can win seats from the Conservatives. A huge number of our target seats are against the Conservatives. On last night\u2019s resignation of the party\u2019s candidate in Thurrock, Kevin McNamara, after 10-year-old racist and homophobic tweets were unearthed, Swinson his statements had been abhorrent. It is absolutely right that he is no longer a candidate for us and that when these things come to light, the party takes swift action. It\u2019s not feasible to have looked at every social media post over the past 15 years for every candidate. What we can control is that, when things like this happen, we take very swift action. Here are the main points from the Jeremy Corbyn Q&amp;A. Corbyn said British voters were now at risk from a Trump/Farage/Johnson alliance that would threaten the NHS, workers\u2019 rights and safe food. In response to a question about the Brexit party decision to stand down candidates in Tory-held seats, he repeated a point made yesterday about Tory and Brexit party interests being aligned. But he also added Donald Trump, and escalated his warning about what might be at risk from a post-Brexit UK-US trade deal negotiated by a government led by Boris Johnson. Corbyn said: What we have before us is an alliance between Donald Trump and Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson. We know where that alliance is designed to take us \u2013 into a sweetheart trade deal with the United States that will threaten all of our regulations, all of our conditions, and threaten our public services ... Farage and Johnson only offer division, division, division, and a deal with Donald Trump. You\u2019ll then be saying whatever happened to our wonderful national health service? Whatever happened to all the regulations that we had that protected our rights at work, our right to clean environment and our right to safe food. All of that is at risk from the kind of trade deal that they want to do with the USA. We will have none of it. It is worth pointing out that Labour claims about what would happen under a UK-US trade deal are like Tory claims about Labour tax policy (see 11.29am) \u2013 not facts, but predictions, based on assumptions of varying degrees of probability. US negotiators would try to put drug pricing on the table in trade talks, and their employment and food quality standards are looser than UK ones. But the Tory government has also said that it would not include the NHS or drug pricing in a trade deal and that it would not lower employment or food standards, and in practice a Johnson administration would be constrained to an extent by what was politically acceptable to the public. Corbyn said that he was \u201cvery nervous\u201d at the thought that yesterday\u2019s cyber attack on Labour could be a foretaste of things to come. Asked about the attack, he said: We have a system in place in our office to protect us against these cyber-attacks, but it was a very serious attack against us. So far as we\u2019re aware none of our information was downloaded and the attack was actually repulsed because we have an effective in-house developed system by people within our party. But if this is a sign of things to come in this election, I feel very nervous about it all because a cyber-attack against a political party in an election is suspicious, something one is very worried about. He said Labour\u2019s transport priority would be improving rail and bus transport north of Birmingham. Asked about the leak of the government review of HS2 (see 9.53am), he said he could not comment on that directly. But he went on: Our priority is investment in rail and bus infrastructure north of Birmingham, into the north-east, north-west and Yorkshire ... As far as we\u2019re concerned, that is the absolute priority. Because if we don\u2019t improve transport links from Birmingham northwards ... and develop the Crossrail for the north, which would be a high-speed, efficient line linking Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Hull, then I think we will see a problem in future economic development across the regions. I\u2018ve been watching Angela Rayner and Jeremy Corbyn speak in a campaign event at Blackpool football club (not that you\u2019d know it, as the blinds are pulled down on the picture windows behind us overlooking the pitch). Corbyn made the arguments for Labour\u2019s lifelong learning policies, including six years of free adult education, which he was here to launch. He was given a standing ovation by the activists here, and his promise that the NHS is \u201cnot for sale\u201d in a trade deal with the US under a Labour government was greeted with enthusiastic applause. But the star turn was Rayner, who talked about the importance of adult education in her own life, after she left school at 16 to look after her son. Under Labour\u2019s policy, she said, \u201cwhether you left school with no GCSEs or 10, your ability to pay or your willingness to take on debt will not determine whether you get the education you need\u201d. She skewered politicians\u2019 habit of parroting the idea that vocational qualifications are as important as academic ones, or that the UK can simply copy Germany. And she had another nice line that \u201cpoverty is not just about being penniless, it is about being powerless\u201d, because workers often don\u2019t have the opportunity to train. Just anecdotally, the atmosphere is warm here, but the audience doesn\u2019t seem quite as big, as young or as lively as the most memorable Labour events I went to during the 2017 campaign. Back then, some Corbyn fans were coming from miles around just to get a glimpse of their man. Labour campaigners I chatted to here said they were finding a lot of \u201cundecideds\u201d on the doorstep. Perhaps enthusiasm will build as we get closer to 12 December? We\u2019ll see. Corbyn says there was a time when being a further education lecturer was a good job. Now he meets many of them on zero-hours contracts, with multiple jobs. They are stressed, he says. He says they come into teaching because they love the job, but many leave because of the stress. There is something going badly wrong, he says. Q: Does Labour still support HS2, even though it would now reportedly cost \u00a388bn? (See 9.53am.) Corbyn says he does not know how accurate this report is. Labour\u2019s priority would be investment in rail and bus infrastructure north of Birmingham. Q: Don\u2019t you need Nigel Farage and the Brexit party to keep standing and split the Brexit vote in Labour marginals? Rayner says it is clear now that if you want a different future for this country, you should vote Labour. If you want a hard-right government, vote for the Conservatives or the Brexit party. She says they are the same. She says she is disgusted about what Boris Johnson has said about communities like hers. She does not fear the Brexit party or Boris Johnson. \u201cBring it on.\u201d Corbyn says people in Britain voted leave and remain. Labour\u2019s strategy is to bring people together. If the election results in a Tory government supported by Nigel Farage, you will have over-sized classrooms, people in debt and people being denied educational chances. A national education service will be Labour\u2019s legacy and its gift to the British people, Corbyn says. Lack of education is \u201csuch a waste\u201d. He says he is trying to bring people together. Farage and Johnson only offer \u201cdivision, division, division\u201d. And they would put the NHS at risk with a trade deal with the US, which would also threaten the environment and our clean food. Q: What is your policy for apprenticeships? Rayner says the party will be talking about its policy at its manifesto launch. Angela Rayner says the Labour manifesto will be about delivering for everyone. It will not put ideology first, she says. Jeremy Corbyn is now taking questions. Q: If you were chairing Cobra on flooding, what measures would you be taking? Corbyn says the floods are appalling. He was in the Don Valley at the weekend. People are in a very difficult situation. He says he would have chaired Cobra earlier to release Bellwin money. Councils should get that money immediately. He also says he would do a lot more on flood defences. We are getting more flooding, he says. He says people in the Don Valley were telling him they were concerned about the quality of dredging of streams flowing into the Don. He says Labour would also make dealing with flood protection a statutory duty for fire brigades. Q: Who do you think was responsible for the cyber-attack on the Labour website? Corbyn says this happened yesterday. It was very serious. But, as far as Labour is aware, none of its data was lost. But, if this is a sign of things to come, he feels \u201cvery nervous\u201d. He says a previous cyber-attack on the NHS was dangerous. He says the attack has been reported to the National Cyber Security Centre, who are investigating. Q: You say you will pay for some of this with VAT on private school fees. Does that mean you won\u2019t abolish private schools? Corbyn says the party will finalise its policy at a meeting this weekend. People will love the manifesto, he says. Q: Do you think the Tories will benefit from the Brexit party standing down in Tory seats? And what will happen if the Brexit party stand in Labour-held seats? Corbyn says there is an alliance between Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Donald Trump. That is a threat to the NHS, he says. He says he is not interested in parlour games about who might stand where. He is putting forward a manifesto that would create a fairer society, he says. He says he approaches elections in a positive frame of mind. Hundreds of people are actively supporting the party, and giving it money, he says. Rayner says Labour will also ensure workers can get time off to study. But poverty is not just about being penniless, it is about being powerless. Too often, workers do not have that power, that time or that security. They have a right to request time off to study, but it can only be training for their current job, and it is easy for their employer to simply say no. This does nothing for the worker trapped on low pay or zero hours, looking to move from a job that isn\u2019t supporting them to a career that can. They are trapped, forced to choose between taking a chance on their education and losing what little economic security they have. That is why Labour will put this power back in the hands of working people. Working with businesses and trade unions, we will give workers a new right to paid time off for education and training, enshrined in law so that they can access the opportunities that are right for them. Rayner says Labour will also offer maintenance support to people in further education. Not only will we make learning itself free and accessible, we will make sure that all barriers, not just tuition, are removed from the path of learners. Too many people will not be able to go back into education because they cannot meet the cost of living. If they had gone to university they could get maintenance support, but this is not an option for too many people taking other routes. This cannot be justified. It locks people out of education, it creates unfairness, and it is a sign of an education system that privileges one form of learning over all others. This will not be the case in Labour\u2019s national education service. Learners who use their entitlement to study at higher levels will also receive maintenance support, on the same basis as their equivalents in higher education. In Labour\u2019s national education service, nobody will be unable to access an opportunity because of their own financial situation. Rayner is now summing up Labour\u2019s offer. Every single adult will be able to access six years of credits at level 4 to 6. Qualifications above A-level, up to and including the equivalent of an undergraduate degree, will be available to all those who need it, whenever they need it. The whole range of qualifications that will be necessary to equip working people for the decades ahead. High level, specialised qualifications in fields such as engineering, digital, and construction, to name a few. From someone who has been stuck in low-paid work or unable to progress, to those who face the risk of being displaced by automation, this new entitlement will empower them to take control of their own lives. Back in Blackpool Angela Rayner is still speaking about Labour\u2019s plans. Whether you left school with no GCSEs or 10, your ability to pay or your willingness to take on debt will not determine whether you get the education you need. In the last eight years, the number of adults achieving a qualification in English and maths has fallen by 40%. This isn\u2019t their fault. We will ensure every adult is supported to re-enter education, and we will give them the chance to gain the basic qualifications they need, whether that\u2019s at level 1, GCSE or through functional skills, so that nobody is locked out of work or other opportunities because they did not succeed in education the first time. And if they don\u2019t already have them, we will provide the funding for everyone to access A-levels, T-levels, or NVQs, whatever level 3 qualification is right for them. These are vital skills, necessary for working people across the country. But we cannot let this be the limit of our ambition. Our goal is a high skill, high wage economy fit for the challenges of the future. Under the Tories, people are trapped in a low skill, low wage economy, unable to make ends meet. Addressing this challenge requires a revolution in our education system. Not more warm words about parity of esteem, or platitudes about matching the performance of Germany. We cannot simply pretend that we can copy a country with a society, economy and education system vastly different to our own. What we require is far bolder than an attempt to imitate our European partners. That is why the next Labour government will deliver the most radical expansion of adult education in our country\u2019s history. As part of the next Labour government\u2019s national education service we will throw open the door to retraining, upskilling and lifelong learning. This is from my colleague Rowena Mason. And here is our story on it. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, is speaking now. She says she has seen four education secretaries since she took up her post. She says Corbyn was one of the first people in the party to call for a cradle-to-grave education system. So it is fitting he is here, she says. She says her life was transformed by adult education. When her friends were sitting their GCSEs, she was thinking about her new baby. Adult education gave her a second chance. She enrolled in a sign language course, and then a counselling course, and that led to volunteering and then a job. Then she went on to get a qualification in care. Education helped her, but also her son, she says. She says this experience encouraged her to become a union rep. Adult education changed my life. It gave me, and so many others, a vital second chance. Corbyn says the Tories should apologise for the way they have cut eduction funding since 2010. The Tories ... want you to be grateful for their offer to reverse some of the cuts to schools made by the Tories. The money they say they\u2019ll put in doesn\u2019t even cover the money they took out. But their feeble promise is an admission that their cuts are damaging and wrong. So are they going to apologise to all the children who have missed out since 2010? Corbyn says Labour would offer \u201cthe best\u201d in education. And what is the best? The best is a Sure Start centre in every community to offer health and welfare advice to new parents. The best is 30 hours of free childcare to all two-, three- and four-year-olds. If you are the parent of a two-year-old, you\u2019ll save \u00a35,000 a year. The best is all primary school children learning in classes of fewer than 30. The best is a free school meal for every child in primary school \u2013 and we\u2019ll put VAT on private school fees to pay for it. The best is an education that prepares children for life, not just exams, so we\u2019ll get rid of unnecessary SATs. The best is every child being able to learn musical instruments, drama and dance \u2013 the things that bring us joy \u2013 through our arts pupil premium. The best is well-funded schools that are locally accountable \u2013 so we\u2019ll end the divisive academy and free schools programme. The best is world-leading further education, which is so important to working class students. And the best is university tuition open to anyone from any background for free, without racking up tens of thousands of pounds in debt. Corbyn says multinational corporations need an educated workforce, and should pay for it. I\u2019d rather give a break to the worker who wants to learn than give a tax break to the billionaire who wants for nothing. That\u2019s the difference between Labour and the Conservatives. It makes me angry when I see big multinational corporations like Amazon and Google, who rely on a well-educated workforce to make their millions, paying hardly any tax in our country. The national education service will benefit those companies by giving their workers the chance to advance their skills. I simply say it would be nice if those multinationals could pay their share towards it. And it makes me angry when I hear of schools closing on a Friday because they can\u2019t pay their bills, while the government can afford multi-billion pound tax giveaways to corporations and the richest. It is our children who suffer as a result. Britain should have the best education service in the world. Corbyn is now speaking about education. He says the party\u2019s plan for a national education service is one of the policies he is most excited about. Imagine it: a national education service that\u2019s there for you as a child; as an adult; and in old age \u2013 so that no one is held back. I see education as an escalator running alongside you throughout life that you can get on and off whenever you want. That\u2019s what Labour\u2019s national education service will offer people \u2013 free education, as a right for all. Under our plan, skills and vocational qualifications will be valued the same as university degrees. So if you left school with few GCSEs but now want to learn a new trade, Labour will make education free for you. If you\u2019ve done the same job for your whole working life and want to change direction, Labour will make education free for you. And if you\u2019ve always wanted to learn new skills but can\u2019t afford the training, Labour will make education free for you. The national education service will allow you to pursue your dreams. Corbyn calls for an assurance that local councils will get reimbursed by central government for the money they spend on dealing with the flooding. We now need a guarantee from the government that the Bellwin money is made immediately available to local government. Back in 2014 Cameron vowed: \u201cWe will build a more resilient country for the future.\u201d Instead, under the Tories, frontline flood response and Environment Agency staff have been slashed by a fifth, and fire and rescue staff by nearly a quarter. So here we are again. We are in a climate and environment emergency. Funding flood defences and emergency responders is a priority. That\u2019s just common sense. In fact, the government announced on Saturday that Bellwin funding would be made available. Jeremy Corbyn starts by thanking Blackpool football club for giving the party a venue for the speech today. He says, before he gets on to education, he wants to talk about the flooding. More than 1,000 homes have been evacuated and one woman, Annie Hall, has lost her life. Our hearts go out to her family and friends. The Conservative government\u2019s response to the floods has been woeful. If this had happened in Surrey instead of Yorkshire and the East Midlands, I think it would have been a very different story. When terrible floods struck the south in 2014, David Cameron rightly said: \u201cMoney is no object in this relief effort. Whatever money is needed, we will spend it.\u201d This time, Boris Johnson waited five days before calling a Cobra meeting \u2013 and only after I wrote to him demanding it. No 10 claims Johnson decided to call a Cobra meeting on flooding before Corbyn called for one publicly yesterday afternoon. There is a live feed of the speech at the top of the blog. Gordon Marsden, who is seeking re-election as Labour MP for Blackpool South, is introducing Jeremy Corbyn. He says the policy announced by Labour today for adult learning is the product of policy work that goes back years. It is based on the work of Labour\u2019s lifelong learning commission (pdf), he says. Jeremy Corbyn is about to give a speech in Blackpool on Labour\u2019s plans for adult education. And this is from the Reuters news agency on the cyber-attack on Labour. These are from Rowland Manthorpe, Sky News\u2019s technology correspondent, on the cyber-attack on Labour. Some Brexit party candidates have been criticising Nigel Farage\u2019s decision not to stand candidates in constituencies won by the Tories in 2017. This is from Robert Wheal, who was due to stand for the Brexit party in Arundel and South Downs. In an interview with LBC this morning, Wheal said: My aim has always been to get out of Europe. Clean break ... I\u2019ve always been very critical of the [Brussels] regime. It\u2019s unelected, as you all know. It spends our money as it sees fit - wastes most of it. It was made very clear to us all at the first Brexit party rally that we will put country before party and that, if Farage managed to arrange a deal with Boris Johnson that he would agree to drop his rotten withdrawal agreement and take on a no deal, we would all stand down and support him. But what we have here is absolute codswallop. This is from Neil Greaves, who was due to stand in Harlow for the Brexit party. Greaves told PA Media: Nigel has let Brexiteers down ... he should be standing up for the 17.4 million people who voted for Brexit. I don\u2019t regard Boris Johnson\u2019s deal as Brexit. It\u2019s not even close. Farage has been totally outmanoeuvred and out-negotiated without Boris [Johnson] even having to say anything. And this is from Ruth Jolley, who was due to stand for the Brexit party in South West Norfolk. And Jolley told PA Media: For me the Brexit party was about more than Brexit. It was a chance to change politics for good and shake up our institutions ... I couldn\u2019t vote for those who are standing in my constituency in all good conscience. I couldn\u2019t vote for [local Conservative candidate and cabinet minister] Liz Truss because I do think the Tories have negotiated a terrible deal. The Labour party says it has suffered a serious cyber-attack. A spokesperson released this statement. We have experienced a sophisticated and large-scale cyber-attack on Labour digital platforms. We took swift action and these attempts failed due to our robust security systems. The integrity of all our platforms was maintained and we are confident that no data breach occurred. Our security procedures have slowed down some of our campaign activities, but these were restored this morning and we are back up to full speed. We have reported the matter to the national cyber security centre. Labour is out campaigning hard both on and offline for a Labour government that will bring the real change our country needs. Every Conservative election campaign in recent history has involved a version of a Labour \u201ctax bombshell\u201d claim, a phrase famously used in a 1992 election poster. The Tories have unveiled theirs today, alleging that personal taxes would go up by \u00a32,400 a head under a Jeremy Corbyn government. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, has been tweeting about it this morning. The Conservatives have tried to justify their claim in a news release here. They have also released a more detailed, 15-page document with their costings here (pdf). All figures published by one political party about the tax and spending plans of another are hypothetical. But they can range between plausible guesswork and mostly made-up. The Tory figures are nearer the \u201cmostly made-up\u201d end of the scale, to a large extent because their baseline assumption is that Labour would spent an extra \u00a31.2tn over the course of a parliament and, for reasons that my colleague Richard Partington explained in a good article on Sunday, some of the assumptions used to come up with this figure are so wrong or unfair as to make it wholly implausible. Labour does have hugely ambitious spending plans, and, although the party says just the richest 5% would pay more under its plans, it is not unreasonable to assume that, in practice, others would have to contribute more. After all, Labour firmly believes that using taxation to fund public services is a good thing. But the Tory claim is not credible. The party could have proposed a plausible figure, but instead put forward a sensational figure. Will it make a difference? Who knows, but it is interesting that it has not featured on any of the front pages of the Conservative papers this morning. The Daily Mail has got a story on page two, and the Sun has got a spread on pages 6 and 7. But the Daily Express and the Daily Telegraph are only running small stories on the claim, on pages 4 and 5 respectively. This is what Jonathan Reynolds, a Labour Treasury spokesman, said about the Tory claim last night. This is more fake news from Conservative HQ after Sajid Javid had his plan to use the civil service for party political ends scuppered. Labour will set out our plans and our costings fully when we release our manifesto. The Conservatives should spend more time looking at their own policies as they failed to produce costings at the last election and \u2013 as Kwasi Kwarteng demonstrated \u2013 have no idea about the cost of their own policies. Labour has described the recent government announcement about a fracking moratorium as bogus, following the release of a Whitehall report showing some support for loosening planning rules related to the process. At the start of this month the government announced an immediate halt on fracking in England, saying it should be stopped with immediate effect \u201cuntil compelling new evidence is provided\u201d that shows fracking is safe. But after that announcement the government quietly released responses to a consultation on changing fracking planning rules. While the document (pdf) acknowledges that current policy is to not allow fracking, it suggests this could change in the future, and it says: \u201cThe government remains committed to making planning decisions faster and fairer for all those affected by new shale developments, whilst also ensuring that local communities are fully involved in planning decisions that affect them.\u201d In a statement, Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said: You can\u2019t trust a word the Tories say on fracking. In just over a week their policy has evolved from a \u201cban\u201d to a \u201ctemporary pause\u201d and now, seemingly, an extreme \u201cfrack-at-will\u201d policy imported from Trump\u2019s USA. Labour would ban fracking, she insisted. Nigel Farage has branded Conservative calls for the Brexit party to stand down in Labour marginals as \u201calmost comical\u201d, saying his party needs to get MPs into parliament to hold Boris Johnson\u2019s feet to the fire, my colleagues Rowena Mason and Kate Proctor report. When Boris Johnson became prime minister he commissioned a review into whether the HS2 rail project should go ahead. The report is not due to be published until after the election, but the Times today says a leaked copy of the document is recommending that HS2 does go ahead - even though the cost is rising to \u00a388bn. In their story (paywall), Louisa Clarence-Smith and Graeme Paton write: The leaked document recommends that the government commit to the full high-speed rail network \u2013 the biggest infrastructure project in Europe \u2013 but admits that it is \u201cnot affordable\u201d within the \u00a356bn budget set in the 2015 government spending review. The new estimate of \u00a388bn is likely to be revised upwards again, the report notes ... The report, written by Douglas Oakervee, the former HS2 chairman, has found that the procurement strategy for the first phase of HS2 has been a failure, with prices being significantly inflated. It also says that escalating costs mean that the benefit to taxpayers has fallen from \u00a32.30 for every \u00a31 spent in 2017 to between \u00a31.30 and \u00a31.50 for every \u00a31 spent this year. However, in a boost for the project, the report says that without HS2 \u201clarge ticket price rises\u201d would be needed to discourage travel at peak times. In an interview on the Today programme, highlighting the plans Labour is announcing today to offer every adult in England six years of free study, Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, confirmed that Labour would abolish university tuition fees. She said: If Labour gets into power on December 13, we will abolish tuition fees, no ifs, no buts. Students at the moment are leaving university with \u00a357,000 worth of debt. That is not sustainable. Our country needs those skills for the future and Labour will reverse that trend and ensure that we have the skills for the future through adult education as well as university education. She also said Labour wanted university vice-chancellors to be paid less. She explained: I absolutely agree that vice-chancellors might not like what I\u2019m saying because I\u2019m saying that vice-chancellors are paid too much and are unaccountable for that pay, and I\u2019ll crack down on that. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Mattha Busby. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, was on BBC Breakfast earlier. We have already quoted a line from him (see 8.31am), but here are details of what he said. Farage urged the Conservatives to stand aside in some Labour-held seats to give the Brexit party a better chance of winning in them. He said: I\u2019ve just gifted the Conservative party nearly two dozen seats and I did it because I believe in leave. Now if they believed in leave what they would do is stand aside in some seats in Labour areas where the Conservative party has not won for 100 years and will never win. I think what you\u2019re seeing from this reaction is for the Conservative party it is about them as a party, not about delivering Brexit. He said it was important for the Brexit party to have MPs in parliament to hold Boris Johnson to account. Assuming a Conservative election victory, he said: What we now need to do is to get Brexit party MPs in parliament to hold him [Boris Johnson] to account. Because too often over the years, recent years, the Conservatives have made promises and then backtracked on them. So that\u2019s our plan, we need to win some of those Labour seats. Farage rejected suggestions that Donald Trump played a role in persuading him not to stand candidates in Tory-held seats. Asked if he had had any communication with Trump about the \u201cleave alliance\u201d he announced yesterday, Farage said: How many times do I have to tell you, I haven\u2019t spoken to him since he was on LBC with me a few weeks ago and he has no influence over my decision at all. My decision is made, number one, to stop a second referendum, to prevent Liberal Democrats winning seats in the south and the south-west, and number two, because Boris Johnson has indicated we\u2019re now going for a free-trade deal, not political linkage. Farage\u2019s answer ignored the fact that, when he did interview Trump on his LBC show two weeks ago, Trump said explicitly that he did want to see Farage and Boris Johnson cooperating. Trump told Farage: [Johnson] respects you a lot, I can tell you that, he respects you a lot, I don\u2019t know if you know that or not ... I wish you two guys could get together, I think it would be a great thing. Sunak did not directly respond to the question of whether anyone apart from the prime minister was preventing the report on Russian influence being published. I\u2019m not a member of the National Security Council, I\u2019m not a privy to the contents of the report but what I do know is that the standard process for reports like this is that they have to go through an appropriate period of vetting due to the sensitive information they contain. The report was received towards the end of October and it takes on average several weeks for that process to happen. Asked if the non-disclosure of the report was \u201cshameful\u201d, Sunak turned his fire on Labour \u2013 in comments that would be strongly rebuked by the party. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair. [Have you asked Clinton] whether she thinks its also shameful that the leader of the opposition sided with Russia when they carried out an attack on our soil? The chief secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, is the latest minister citing disputed figures on Labour\u2019s spending commitments. He said the Tories\u2019 pledges would be delivered without increased taxation. Asked if Labour\u2019s pledge of an extra \u00a36bn for social care was appropriate, Sunak told the Today programme: If you\u2019re talking about spending commitments, you have to look at them in the round and not in isolation. If you look at it in the round, we\u2019ve seen from the Labour party a quite frankly reckless amount of uncosted spending commitments. Pressed on the specific social care figure, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve invested in the social care system to ensure it is stable for the next year. I\u2019m not actually sure of the details of the Labour plans. I can\u2019t tell you what it does or doesn\u2019t do.\u201d However, Sunak went on to claim Labour\u2019s plans would effectively cost each taxpayer an extra \u00a32,400 each year. We will not borrow for day-to-day spending. The Office for Budget Responsibility forecast show that there are are \u00a330bn surplus on the current balance over the next few years. We\u2019ve said we will invest about \u00a313.5bn on people\u2019s priorities, like the NHS, schools, policing. We will not tax people extra. My colleague Rowena Mason reports that Nigel Farage has rejected suggestions that the US president had any role in his decision to not run Brexit party candidates in Tory-held seats. The Brexit party leader spoke to Sky yesterday in Hartlepool: Labour\u2019s Ben Bradshaw has tweeted this morning urging the report to be released: \u201cJohnson doesn\u2019t want you to know about all those Russian Tory donors or the extent of the Kremlin\u2019s interference in our democracy.\u201d David Lammy tweeted: \u201cThe rest of the world is looking on in horror at Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to cover up the report into Russian interference in our democracy.\u201d Mike Gapes tweeted: \u201cWhy is Johnson not releasing this agreed intelligence and security Committee report? What have Conservatives got to hide? Dodgy donations? Close links with Putin oligarchs? Direct Kremlin interference in EU Referendum? Personal Russian links to Johnson or his key advisers?\u201d Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has been on Good Morning Britain defending the government and saying its normal for these kinds of reports to go through several weeks of vetting to ensure sensitive passages are redacted. He\u2019ll be on the Today programme shortly, followed by Labour\u2019s shadow education secretary, Angela Raynor. Hillary Clinton, the former US secretary of state, has said she is \u201cdumbfounded\u201d that Downing Street will not release a report that examines Russian infiltration of British politics. Last night Clinton told the Guardian that the suppression of the intelligence and security committee report by Boris Johnson\u2019s government was \u201cdamaging, inexplicable and shaming\u201d. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning: We need a strong UK. We need a UK with smart, sensible, forward looking leadership. So I\u2019m dumbfounded that this government won\u2019t release the report about Russian influence. Because every person who votes in this country deserves to see that report before your election happens. That should be an absolute condition because there is no doubt, we\u2019ve seen it in our country, we\u2019ve seen it in Europe, we\u2019ve seen it here [in the UK]. That Russia in particular, is determined to try to shape the politics of Western democracies, not to our benefit, but theirs. Away from the election, and emergency hospital admissions for children with pneumonia have risen by more than 50% in England over the past decade, figures have suggested, with admission rates highest in more deprived areas. According to NHS Digital data analysed by the charities Unicef and Save the Children, the rise is being primarily driven by a large increase in bronchiolitis, with small increases in other diagnoses including viral pneumonia and influenza with pneumonia. You can read the full story here. Jeremy Corbyn has started the day by sending good wishes to Sikhs in the UK and around the world celebrating the birthday of Guru Nana. Australia\u2019s former high commissioner to London, Alexander Downer, has intervened in the election campaign in a fairly spectacular way. Speaking at the National Press Club in Canberra, Downer declared that Australia would need to \u201csubstantially reduce\u201d intelligence sharing with London in the event Jeremy Corbyn wins on 12 December. As Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor, Katharine Murphy, writes, Downer, in an excoriating assessment of the Labour leader, contended that a Corbyn victory would imperil substantial Australian investments in Britain, and would trigger a reassessment of the \u201cvery intimate\u201d security relationship between Canberra and London. Downer said the UK election result mattered to Australia because Britain was the second-largest offshore destination for Australian investment. The Guardian has unearthed a video showing how Dominic Cummings honed his people-versus-parliament strategy as far back as 2004. A video from the North East Says No (Nesno) campaign in the north-east referendum of 2004 (where Cummings was strategy adviser) deploys strategies reminiscent of Vote Leave\u2019s 2016 playbook, writes Johnny McDevitt. The advert from the \u201cforgotten referendum\u201d not only pits the people against politicians but also pledges to pump millions into the NHS that would otherwise be used to run political institutions. Nesno\u2019s campaign defeated the then deputy prime minister John Prescott\u2019s plan for regional assemblies, including a 78% rejection of devolution \u2013 despite early polling predicting a 60%-plus victory for the government\u2019s \u201cyes\u201d campaign. The morning papers are full of Nigel Farage\u2019s U-turn on fielding candidates in Tory seats. The Mirror doesn\u2019t lead with Farage, but with the ongoing floods crisis. Here are some of the comings and goings we can expect on the campaign trail today: Boris Johnson will chair a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee in response to the floods in the north. Jo Swinson will travel to flood-affected South Yorkshire. The Lib Dems are promising a \u20ac5bn fund for investment in flood defences. Jeremy Corbyn will launch Labour\u2019s adult education and further education policy in Blackpool. Nicola Sturgeon will join SNP candidate Catriona MacDonald on the campaign trail in Edinburgh South. There will be a Brexit party rally in Westminster at 11am. And not directly campaign-related, Labour\u2019s MP in the North Yorkshire seat of Redcar, Anna Turley, will be back in court today where she is suing the party\u2019s biggest backer, Unite, for defamation. Good morning and welcome to Tuesday\u2019s live coverage of the general election campaign. I\u2019m Alison Rourke and I\u2019ll be kicking off the day\u2019s news where Nigel Farage has made a significant entrance into proceedings. After the Brexit party leader promised yesterday not to stand his candidates in the seats of sitting Conservative MPs, senior Tories are now pushing for him to go one step further, and withdraw from contests in which the Conservatives are targeting Labour MPs. Farage claims his U-turn over standing candidates in the 317 Tory seats came after the PM released a video in which he pledged to go after a free-trade \u201csuper-Canada-plus\u201d style arrangement. Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems say Farage\u2019s reversal points to a pact between him and Johnson over a secret hard-Brexit deal, something both have denied. You can read Dan Sabbagh\u2019s analysis of why Farage\u2019s move may not help the Tories as much as it first appears here. Labour will announce its education pledge today, including six years of free study for adults. Under plans for a radical expansion of adult learning the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, will say any adult without without A-level or equivalent qualifications would be able to study for them for free at college, with maintenance grants available for those on low incomes. But as Fiona Millar writes, Labour should be sweeping the floor with the Tories who have \u201cbrought schools to their knees\u201d, but still seem to be stumbling, including just last week asking for education policy ideas. Let\u2019s get started on the day.",
