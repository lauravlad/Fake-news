Secondly, the entire promise of Brexit on food and agriculture was to open up the UK to \u201cworld\u201d foods, with deregulation as a driver.

Like his former boss at Defra, Michael Gove, he assures British consumers that high standards are essential in any post-Brexit future. As co-authors of six reports on these issues since 2017, we remain sceptical. Firstly, while the words are fine, until his resignation, Mr Eustice was in charge at Defra of steering the agriculture bill through parliament. This places no legal duties or responsibilities on ministers for delivering high standards, hence the welter of anxious amendments before the Commons. Secondly, the entire promise of Brexit on food and agriculture was to open up the UK to \u201cworld\u201d foods, with deregulation as a driver. And thirdly, as the US trade representative and US ambassador have made amply clear, the UK will be in a weak position vis-a-vis US demands to allow access for its food products after Brexit. As a leading Brexiteer, Mr Eustice\u2019s reputation stands in the balance, not just British food standards. Erik Millstone Professor emeritus, Science Policy Research Unit, University of Sussex Tim Lang Professor of food policy, City, University of London \u2022 America once knew what it was like to trade at a disadvantage with Britain, but it now appears that the boot may soon be on a different foot. The time could come when this country has to \u201ctake back control\u201d with a re-enactment of the Boston Tea Party by dumping American chemically treated beef overboard into the sea.

Hunt said it was too dangerous to send British officials to rescue the 19-year-old\u2019s baby son from the camp in Syria, and she knew she would not be able to rely on British consular assistance when she went to the Islamic State-held territory. But he appeared to signal a change of policy when he said the Foreign Office was now working with the Department for International Development on ways of contacting and removing British children in the camps. Hunt, in reference to Begum who was stripped of her citizenship on the orders of the home secretary, Sajid Javid, gave the first reaction by a senior government figure since it emerged that the teenager\u2019s son had died in a Syrian camp. He told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that Begum \u201cchose to leave a free country to join a terrorist organisation and we have to think about the safety of British officials that I would send into that war zone as a representative of the government\u201d. Challenged as to why officials could not have gone to rescue the child from a camp where the press had gone to interview Begum and others, Hunt said journalists had \u201csome protection\u201d but added: \u201cSending a British government official into a war zone in a situation where you are getting advice that those officials\u2019 lives may be put at risk is a very different matter.\u201d Hunt said earlier: \u201cShamima knew, when she made the decision to join Daesh [another name for Isis], she was going into a country where there was no embassy.

If political Twitter feels increasingly like hard work, Instagram is one of the few places MPs still allow themselves to be playful.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a whole different world,\u201d says the Conservative backbencher Nadine Dorries, whose Twitter account this week featured a snapshot of her bedside panic button but whose Instagram focuses more on sweet <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BnqZuTKgfGy/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\" title=\"\">images of her dogs</a>. \u201cMy daughters are on it, my friends are on it, and I like to do things like look at kitchens because I\u2019m having my kitchen done.

(Dorries was an early social media adopter who became warier after suffering the attentions of a <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/tory-mp-nadine-dorries-reveals-4258126\" title=\"\">stalker</a>; these days she isn\u2019t on Facebook and tweets sparingly, feeling the site has been \u201ctaken over by the hard left and the hard right\u201d.) On Instagram at least, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jess-phillips\" title=\"\">Jess Phillips</a> can still discuss domestic violence le gislation without being called a feminazi, while Diane Abbott\u2019s official account is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BubQqaqhy-y/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\" title=\"\">swamped with heart emojis</a> not racist abuse. But has the platform really cracked the puzzle of detoxifying political debate, or is this just the calm before the incoming storm?</p> <p>The faster Instagram grows, the more seriously politicians are taking it. The race for US presidential nominations is already beginning on Instagram Live, the site\u2019s video live-streaming function, where you can watch veteran Democrat Elizabeth Warren chatting over a beer or young pretender <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/22/beto-orourke-voting-record-2020-election-democrats\" title=\"\">Beto O\u2019Rourke</a> making \u201cslime\u201d (a tween craze) with his daughter.

What better way to suggest a lovable personal hinterland, while showing willing to connect with younger voters?</p> <p>A new generation of visually literate young activists are meanwhile using Instagram to campaign on issues from gun control in the US to \u201cperiod poverty\u201d. \u201cIn terms of influencing it\u2019s great, though it\u2019s not necessarily as impactful as Twitter,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/22/anti-fgm-activist-nimco-ali-says-australian-feminism-stuck-in-the-1980s\" title=\"\">anti-FGM activist Nimco Ali</a>, who uses both sites. \u201cIf you understand branding, which is what campaigning is, and you can brand your campaign aesthetically, Instagram can be the place for you. If you want to hone your message, Twitter is the place.\u201d</p> <p>Yet political Instagram is developing a darker side too, with active communities of anti-vaxxers peddling disproven junk science about measles jabs causing autism, Russian trolls pumping out pro-Kremlin propaganda, and alt-right sympathisers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Lucy Powell with the actor James Nesbitt on the set of Cold Feet.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

It\u2019s more rewarding for trolls to harass public figures on a viral platform like Twitter, where journalists are more likely to notice and reward them with attention. Radicalising people is arguably easier via YouTube, where video holds people\u2019s attention for long periods, and algorithms lead them to similar content. Extremists seemingly prefer to organise inside Facebook groups, which provide them with somewhere private to exchange toxic ideas.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a problem with Facebook groups,\u201d says Lucy Powell, the Labour MP who is urging more transparency over the memberships of larger groups and greater accountability for group hosts spreading fake or libellous information. \u201cAdministrators can get rid of anyone who doesn\u2019t share their world view and indoctrinate people by normalising opinions that wouldn\u2019t last five minutes in the pub. On Instagram, you can only leave a comment on the person\u2019s page, and you are clearly the author.\u201d</p> <p>Nor does Instagram lend itself to Twitter-style pile-ons, where big names retweet (share beyond its intended audience) someone else\u2019s tweet, inciting followers to ridicule or attack it. Instagram doesn\u2019t have a \u201cre-gram\u201d function, and although people can share screenshots of someone else\u2019s words, users mainly see content from people they\u2019ve chosen to follow and probably like. That reduces potential for bullying but also arguably the potential for robust argument and counter-argument, raising the question of whether it\u2019s even possible to do politics without some conflict.</p> <p>One reason political Instagram has stayed friendly is that it\u2019s often barely about politics. Like many MPs, Powell treats her <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lucympowell/?hl=en\" title=\"\">own Instagram account</a> as relaxing down time \u2013 \u201cI use it to keep up with people who\u2019ve left <em>Love Island</em> or what Holly Willoughby\u2019s wearing on <em>This Morning</em>\u201d \u2013 and followers respond accordingly. It would feel faintly odd to start a fight over a picture of someone\u2019s cat.</p> <p>But it probably helps that users are predominantly young, female, more likely than tweeters to come from ethnic minorities and crucially less interested in politics. A community associated with fashion and \u201cfitspo\u201d isn\u2019t naturally attractive to political obsessives spoiling for a fight. Besides, the site\u2019s sunny nature may be contagious. One study of Facebook users found that when their feeds were altered to include more positive or negative stories, behaviour shifted accordingly; people who saw more negative material posted more of it themselves and vice versa. Instagram, with its bouncy #familyfun hashtags, still feels friendly and upbeat. The snag is that so did Twitter a decade ago. As platforms expand, and their demographic changes, so can the prevailing mood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Liz Truss with Larry, the Downing Street cat.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

      "bodyText": "Tom Watson is spiralising courgettes with a gadget bought in a supermarket sale. Caroline Flint looks thrilled with the mini trampoline she got for Christmas, though arguably not as thrilled as Tory leadership contender Liz Truss is to be posing with Larry the Downing Street cat on her knee. And Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, wants you to know he\u2019s been doing some DIY. Welcome to the soothingly soporific world of politicians on Instagram. You won\u2019t find many profound insights on Brexit, admittedly. But in a week where two Conservative councillors were caught \u201cliking\u201d Facebook memes about beheading Sadiq Khan while Labour\u2019s Angela Rayner received death threats for tweeting something polite about Tony Blair, there\u2019s something undeniably restful about looking at pictures of Emily Thornberry stroking a penguin. If political Twitter feels increasingly like hard work, Instagram is one of the few places MPs still allow themselves to be playful. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole different world,\u201d says the Conservative backbencher Nadine Dorries, whose Twitter account this week featured a snapshot of her bedside panic button but whose Instagram focuses more on sweet images of her dogs. \u201cMy daughters are on it, my friends are on it, and I like to do things like look at kitchens because I\u2019m having my kitchen done. Twitter is for politics. Instagram is for people I like and things I want to see \u2013 the other half of my life.\u201d It\u2019s also become something of a safe space for female and minority politicians, who bear the brunt of vitriol elsewhere. (Dorries was an early social media adopter who became warier after suffering the attentions of a stalker; these days she isn\u2019t on Facebook and tweets sparingly, feeling the site has been \u201ctaken over by the hard left and the hard right\u201d.) On Instagram at least, Jess Phillips can still discuss domestic violence le gislation without being called a feminazi, while Diane Abbott\u2019s official account is swamped with heart emojis not racist abuse. But has the platform really cracked the puzzle of detoxifying political debate, or is this just the calm before the incoming storm? The faster Instagram grows, the more seriously politicians are taking it. The race for US presidential nominations is already beginning on Instagram Live, the site\u2019s video live-streaming function, where you can watch veteran Democrat Elizabeth Warren chatting over a beer or young pretender Beto O\u2019Rourke making \u201cslime\u201d (a tween craze) with his daughter. In Britain, Chuka Umunna marked the creation of centrist breakaway faction the Independent Group by Instagramming a picture of its founding members eating chicken at Nando\u2019s, while Tory leadership contenders Jacob Rees-Mogg, Boris Johnson, Truss and Williamson are all cultivating followings. What better way to suggest a lovable personal hinterland, while showing willing to connect with younger voters? A new generation of visually literate young activists are meanwhile using Instagram to campaign on issues from gun control in the US to \u201cperiod poverty\u201d. \u201cIn terms of influencing it\u2019s great, though it\u2019s not necessarily as impactful as Twitter,\u201d says anti-FGM activist Nimco Ali, who uses both sites. \u201cIf you understand branding, which is what campaigning is, and you can brand your campaign aesthetically, Instagram can be the place for you. If you want to hone your message, Twitter is the place.\u201d Yet political Instagram is developing a darker side too, with active communities of anti-vaxxers peddling disproven junk science about measles jabs causing autism, Russian trolls pumping out pro-Kremlin propaganda, and alt-right sympathisers. In some ways, Instagram is better inoculated against viral hate than its rivals. It\u2019s more rewarding for trolls to harass public figures on a viral platform like Twitter, where journalists are more likely to notice and reward them with attention. Radicalising people is arguably easier via YouTube, where video holds people\u2019s attention for long periods, and algorithms lead them to similar content. Extremists seemingly prefer to organise inside Facebook groups, which provide them with somewhere private to exchange toxic ideas. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a problem with Facebook groups,\u201d says Lucy Powell, the Labour MP who is urging more transparency over the memberships of larger groups and greater accountability for group hosts spreading fake or libellous information. \u201cAdministrators can get rid of anyone who doesn\u2019t share their world view and indoctrinate people by normalising opinions that wouldn\u2019t last five minutes in the pub. On Instagram, you can only leave a comment on the person\u2019s page, and you are clearly the author.\u201d Nor does Instagram lend itself to Twitter-style pile-ons, where big names retweet (share beyond its intended audience) someone else\u2019s tweet, inciting followers to ridicule or attack it. Instagram doesn\u2019t have a \u201cre-gram\u201d function, and although people can share screenshots of someone else\u2019s words, users mainly see content from people they\u2019ve chosen to follow and probably like. That reduces potential for bullying but also arguably the potential for robust argument and counter-argument, raising the question of whether it\u2019s even possible to do politics without some conflict. One reason political Instagram has stayed friendly is that it\u2019s often barely about politics. Like many MPs, Powell treats her own Instagram account as relaxing down time \u2013 \u201cI use it to keep up with people who\u2019ve left Love Island or what Holly Willoughby\u2019s wearing on This Morning\u201d \u2013 and followers respond accordingly. It would feel faintly odd to start a fight over a picture of someone\u2019s cat. But it probably helps that users are predominantly young, female, more likely than tweeters to come from ethnic minorities and crucially less interested in politics. A community associated with fashion and \u201cfitspo\u201d isn\u2019t naturally attractive to political obsessives spoiling for a fight. Besides, the site\u2019s sunny nature may be contagious. One study of Facebook users found that when their feeds were altered to include more positive or negative stories, behaviour shifted accordingly; people who saw more negative material posted more of it themselves and vice versa. Instagram, with its bouncy #familyfun hashtags, still feels friendly and upbeat. The snag is that so did Twitter a decade ago. As platforms expand, and their demographic changes, so can the prevailing mood. Instagram recently banned the far-right activist Tommy Robinson, but alt-right rabble-rousers Katie Hopkins and Milo Yiannopoulos have popular accounts; feuds begun on other platforms are visibly spilling over on to Instagram, as has the angry Brexit lexicon of betrayal. \u201cYou are a traitor to Britain trying to stop the will of the people lets [sic] hope you get voted out\u201d reads one comment on a perfectly anodyne post about students from Yvette Cooper. And while most of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s 195,000 followers lap up pictures of him eating vegetarian curry or addressing rallies, the Labour leader\u2019s feed also attracts aggressive comments about everything from Brexit to his long-ago love affair with Abbott, plus supportive but distinctly un-Instagrammish references to \u201cTory scum\u201d. More disturbingly, a recent Holocaust Day post noting that 6 million Jews were killed in the second world war brought at least one Holocaust denier out of the woodwork, while comments on a post about economic inequality quickly descended into a row about antisemitism. For now, the volume of abuse is tiny compared to other platforms. But worryingly for some veteran far-right watchers there is no easy way of tracking one individual\u2019s comments, potentially scattered on hundreds of posts across the site, which makes it potentially harder to monitor. The greatest risk is arguably that Instagram\u2019s natural fluffiness could make users complacent about the nature of the threat or even help to normalise extreme content placed there.
