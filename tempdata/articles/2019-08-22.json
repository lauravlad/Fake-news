By chance I was clearing out some shelves in the office yesterday and discovered a report written by Cummings in June 2014, a good two years before the EU referendum. It presented the findings of focus group research exploring attitudes towards the EU, and it concluded with a paragraph about what actually leaving the EU would be like. Cummings wrote:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Leaving the EU would be a huge and complex affair that would require resources far beyond the reach of any political party or normal campaign, and, in this author\u2019s opinion, would be an exercise far beyond Whitehall as it currently works. Those who want either substantial reform of the EU or leave will have to innovate. One obvious idea is to develop a roadmap and the framework for a new UK-EU treaty \u2018Wiki-style\u2019. Such decentralised movements have achieved astonishing things in science and could in politics.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When Cummings wrote this the referendum was just a promise from David Cameron, who was not expected to win a majority at the 2015 general election to implement it, and a vote to leave would have been regarded by many as an extremely remote possibility. A lot has changed since then, although not in the way the machinery of government works. Whether or not Brexit is an exercise \u201cfar beyond\u201d Whitehall\u2019s ability will be something Cummings will be in the process of finding out.</p> \n  <p>There is a reference to the Cummings paper, which was commissioned by the Business for Britain group, <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/2014/06/30/my-report-for-business-for-britain-on-the-dynamics-of-the-debate-over-the-eu-and-a-small-but-telling-process-point-on-the-eu/\">on his blog,</a> but the link to the report no longer works. That\u2019s a shame because it is well worth reading. In it Cummings argues that recent mass immigration and the financial crisis have changed the dynamics of the EU debate, that Cameron\u2019s proposed renegotiation is unlikely to make voters feel more pro-EU, that an out campaign should avoid taking specific positions on many issues and that the best argument for leaving would be \u201cwe will save a fortune and we can spend that on the NHS or tax cuts or whatever we want to make Britain stronger\u201d. Most political strategy documents turn out to be unreliable guides to the future but this one is unusual because, five years on, its analysis seems prescient. Which is all the more reason for thinking Cummings might have been right about Whitehall failing to cope with Brexit too ...<br></p> \n  <p><em>UPDATE:</em> The full text of the report is available.

They include passing a law to mandate Johnson to extend article 50 to facilitate an election or second referendum; gaining support for revoking article 50 if there is no deal by 31 October; finding a way to bring the withdrawal bill back to the Commons; and defeating Johnson in a no-confidence vote before forming a caretaker government.</p> \n   <p>However, there are splits within the MPs fighting against a no-deal Brexit concerning the best plan, with some wanting to move straight to a no-confidence vote and others believing a legislative route to prevent a disorderly exit is the best option.</p> \n   <p>There is no agreement over who should lead a caretaker government \u2013 whether Corbyn or a veteran figure such as Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman. Nor is there agreement about what an extension to article 50 would be used for, such as a general election or second referendum.<br></p> \n   <p>A number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives\">Conservatives</a> and independent MPs have said they could not support Corbyn as leader of a caretaker government but the Labour leader has insisted he is the only suitable candidate for that role.</p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> insiders said the party was feeling under increasing pressure to bring an early no-confidence vote soon after parliament returns even if it is not winnable yet, as it could show the prime minister just how close he is to losing control of No 10 by pursuing a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n   <p>Meanwhile, rebel Conservative MPs are still working on legislative ways to mandate an extension to article 50, but some are despairing over whether that is possible and have been returning to examining ways to go back to Theresa May\u2019s deal to test support for it against a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Today<strong> Nick Boles</strong>, the former Tory-turned-independent MP who was invited to the Corbyn meeting, has released the text of his reply, explaining why he won\u2019t be attending.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NickBoles/status/1164505982266937344\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Most of the MPs who led the successful attempt to stop No Deal Brexit at the end of March decided to put the interests of the country before the interests of their party, and their own careers.

But Boles disagrees, and he says he would not support such a vote while it remains possible that Johnson could achieve a Brexit deal.</p> \n  <p><strong>2) Interim government leader?</strong> Corbyn argues that he should lead any interim government set up following a successful no-confidence vote. Boles says that he would never support such a government, and that several other opposition MPs feel the same way.</p> \n  <p><strong><em>3) Legislating to require the PM to request an article 50 extension? </em></strong>Earlier this year MPs passed a bill tabled by Yvette Cooper requiring Theresa May as PM to request an article 50 extension. But by that point May was already committed to requesting an extension. Boles wants to use similar legislation for force Johnson to request an extension. But other MPs opposed to no deal have doubts about this strategy. It is not at all clear how binding legislation like this would be, in practical terms, on a PM who did not want comply. (For example, he could request an extension, but only half-heartedly.) And the bill would not compel the EU to agree to offer an extension.</p> \n  <p><strong><em>4) An early election?</em></strong> Boles argues that, to prevent the bill requiring him to seek an article 50 extension becoming law, Johnson would try to trigger an early election, to take place shortly after a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. No 10 has reportedly decided that, in those circumstances, it would ignore calls to delay Brexit pending the result of the election. Boles says an early election would only happen if Labour MPs were to vote for it, and he urges Corbyn to rule that out. But Corbyn\u2019s strategy for avoiding a no-deal Brexit depends on holding a no-confidence vote that could result in an early election (if Johnson were to lose the vote, and no alternative government were to get a majority within 14 days.)</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0dd47f6b0ddec8d7437fd9a71bb44831aa3dd57\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0dd47f6b0ddec8d7437fd9a71bb44831aa3dd57/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Boles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Boles</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-23T06:58:06.225Z\">at 7.58am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d5e8b5b8f081cf11cf1b0f9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-22T12:36:08.895Z\">1.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Mujtaba Rahman,</strong> the former European commission official who does Brexit analysis for the Eurasia consultancy, has a good take on the exchanges.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Mij_Europe/status/1164511606841184256\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@EmmanuelMacron</a> has taken up &amp; amplified Merkel\u2019s 30 day challenge to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BorisJohnson</a>, arguing UK must produce \u201cvisibility\u201d on its alternative ideas for backstop within 30 days.

But today he is in Paris for lunch with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and their exchanges might be considerably more prickly. Macron has repeatedly accused the leave campaign, that Johnson led, of lying to the British public, of all the main EU leaders he has been least willing to make concessions to the UK over Brexit, and yesterday, in a two-and-a-half hour briefing with journalists (not mainly about Johnson \u2013 the UK is not that important to France \u2013 it was a marathon event because Macron is hosting the G7 summit at the weekend) Macron delivered two very unpalatable messages for his British counterpart.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Macron said that renegotiating the EU withdrawal agreement was \u201cnot an option\u201d. </strong>Johnson says, without a renegotiation, there will be no Brexit deal.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Macron suggested that Brexit would stop the UK being a great power. </strong>This was particularly provocative because Johnson claims that Brexit will enhance the UK\u2019s independence and prestige. But Macron argued that Brexit would leave the UK dependent on the US. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The British are attached to being a great power, a member of the security council. The point can\u2019t be to exit Europe and say \u2018we\u2019ll be stronger\u2019, before in the end, becoming the junior partner of the United States, which are acting more and more hegemonically.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In a particularly neat twist, using the language of Brexiters to contest one of the main claims of the Brexit project, Macron even suggested that outside the EU, instead of being released from European vassalage, Britain would end up a vassal state of the US.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Can the cost for Britain of a hard Brexit \u2013 because Britain will be the main victim \u2013 be offset by the United States of America? No.</p> \n   <p>And even if it were a strategic choice it would be at the cost of a historic vassalisation of Britain. I don\u2019t think this is what Boris Johnson wants. I don\u2019t think it is what the British people want. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the will of the British people \u2026 to become the junior partner of the US.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>There are more accounts of what Macron said at his briefing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/21/merkel-gives-johnson-30-days-to-find-solution-to-avoid-no-deal-brexit\">at the Guardian</a>,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/21/merkel-gives-johnson-30-days-to-find-solution-to-avoid-no-deal-brexit\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/macron-taunts-boris-johnson-uk-could-become-vassal-state-of-us_uk_5d5e42f0e4b0dfcbd4883852?ir\">at HuffPost</a>, <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/macrons-masterplan-for-trump-the-universe-and-everything/\">at Politico Europe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-macron/frances-macron-says-no-deal-brexit-would-be-britains-fault-idUSKCN1VB26S\">at Reuters.</a></p> \n  <p>My colleague <strong>Angelique Chrisafis</strong> has written a preview of the Macron/Johnson meeting which has some very good background on their relationship.

      "bodyText": "Emmanuel Macron has described the Irish backstop as \u201cindispensable\u201d to a Brexit deal and urged Boris Johnson to set out his proposed alternatives as soon as possible, as he met the British prime minister in Paris on Thursday. The former Conservative MP Nick Boles has demanded that Jeremy Corbyn rule out backing a general election that could lead to the UK leaving the EU without a deal on 31 October. Richard Braine, the new Ukip leader, has been accused of whipping up religious tensions and anti-Muslim prejudice after leaked emails showed he argued that people should no more want Muslims to settle in their country than Nazis. Immigration to the UK from the EU remains at its lowest level since 2013, according to disputed estimates from the Office for National Statistics. The chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland has warned that the return of a hard border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could revive paramilitary groups. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. It seems the Boris Johnson \u2018foot on the table\u2019 picture was not all that it seems. According to Sky\u2019s Tom Rayner, Johnson was responding to a jokey suggestion from Emmanuel Macron that the table would work well as a footstool. Johnson put his foot on the table only very fleetingly. As the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Bojan Pancevski says, the full photograph is superb. My colleague Jessica Elgot has more on the meeting that Jeremy Corbyn is holding next week with MPs from other parties to discuss efforts to stop a no-deal Brexit. This is from the Financial Times\u2019 Sebastian Payne. Boris Johnson has tweeted a picture of himself with Emmanuel Macron. In this one he\u2019s got his feet on the floor. Boris Johnson opted for the informal approach as he sat down with Emmanuel Macron in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. But is it really okay to put your foot on someone else\u2019s table when you\u2019re a guest? That would never have happened with Theresa May. UPDATE: Pictures do not always tell the full story. See 4.53pm. On the World at One Tony Smith, a former director general of the UK Border Force and a member of the panel advising the Alternative Arrangements Commission, said the EU should take its recommendations more seriously. Boris Johnson says the AAC\u2019s report shows why the backstop is unnecessary, because other mechanisms could avoid the need for a hard border in Ireland after Brexit. Smith explained: What [the EU] have missed is (a) that borders generally globally are going through a paradigm shift [with the] introduction of digital technology and systems, and processes. So the days in which I operated, when you are sitting out in a kiosk, checking papers on a border post, are disappearing anyway, globally. Regardless of what\u2019s happening in Ireland I think they need to give due weight to that and look a lot more closely - you know, you can actually have an invisible border. There are other ways of doing checks now because of technology. It\u2019s not just technology, it needs regulation as well and cooperation and goodwill. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s been lacking. We haven\u2019t been able to get traction at the right levels in the [European] commission with our report, and with UK officials, to be able to push this down to an operational level to talk about what practically can we do on both sides to deliver the border that we need. The Press Association report quoted Emmanuel Macron as saying he was seen as the \u201cthe hard boy in the group\u201d on Brexit (see 1.25pm), but this might not be the best translation. My colleague Angelique Chrisafis just translated it as \u201ctoughest\u201d in the group. What he said in French was \u201cle plus dur de la bande\u201d. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has clarified that when she spoke about Boris Johnson having 30 days to come up with a solution to the backstop yesterday, she was not setting a literal deadline. Speaking at a news conference in The Hague, she said: I said that what one can achieve in three or two years can also be achieved in 30 days. Better said, one must say that one can also achieve it by 31 October. It is not about 30 days. The 30 days were meant as an example to highlight the fact that we need to achieve it in a short time because Britain had said they want to leave the European Union on 31 October. (Some of us thought that it was clear that Merkel was only making a general point, and not referring to a date on the calendar, although Boris Johnson was happy to treat this as a firm timetable.) Merkel now seems to be saying that the deadline is 31 October. But this contradicts what Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said at his event with Johnson earlier. \u201cNo one will wait until October 31 to find the right solution,\u201d said Macron. Here is my colleague Angelique Chrisafis\u2019 take from Paris on the Merkel/Johnson meeting. David Davis may think that the government will be able to cope with a no-deal Brexit perfectly well (see 10.52am), but in the past Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s de facto chief of staff, took a very different view. By chance I was clearing out some shelves in the office yesterday and discovered a report written by Cummings in June 2014, a good two years before the EU referendum. It presented the findings of focus group research exploring attitudes towards the EU, and it concluded with a paragraph about what actually leaving the EU would be like. Cummings wrote: Leaving the EU would be a huge and complex affair that would require resources far beyond the reach of any political party or normal campaign, and, in this author\u2019s opinion, would be an exercise far beyond Whitehall as it currently works. Those who want either substantial reform of the EU or leave will have to innovate. One obvious idea is to develop a roadmap and the framework for a new UK-EU treaty \u2018Wiki-style\u2019. Such decentralised movements have achieved astonishing things in science and could in politics. When Cummings wrote this the referendum was just a promise from David Cameron, who was not expected to win a majority at the 2015 general election to implement it, and a vote to leave would have been regarded by many as an extremely remote possibility. A lot has changed since then, although not in the way the machinery of government works. Whether or not Brexit is an exercise \u201cfar beyond\u201d Whitehall\u2019s ability will be something Cummings will be in the process of finding out. There is a reference to the Cummings paper, which was commissioned by the Business for Britain group, on his blog, but the link to the report no longer works. That\u2019s a shame because it is well worth reading. In it Cummings argues that recent mass immigration and the financial crisis have changed the dynamics of the EU debate, that Cameron\u2019s proposed renegotiation is unlikely to make voters feel more pro-EU, that an out campaign should avoid taking specific positions on many issues and that the best argument for leaving would be \u201cwe will save a fortune and we can spend that on the NHS or tax cuts or whatever we want to make Britain stronger\u201d. Most political strategy documents turn out to be unreliable guides to the future but this one is unusual because, five years on, its analysis seems prescient. Which is all the more reason for thinking Cummings might have been right about Whitehall failing to cope with Brexit too ... UPDATE: The full text of the report is available. Jon Worth has sent me a link. A majority of MPs are opposed to a no-deal Brexit but they can\u2019t agree on what they should do to stop it happening. In her story today about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision to invite the other opposition parties and some Tory rebels to a meeting next week to discuss tactics, my colleague Rowena Mason has a good explanation of what some of the dividing lines are. There are several separate plans to stop the UK crashing out. They include passing a law to mandate Johnson to extend article 50 to facilitate an election or second referendum; gaining support for revoking article 50 if there is no deal by 31 October; finding a way to bring the withdrawal bill back to the Commons; and defeating Johnson in a no-confidence vote before forming a caretaker government. However, there are splits within the MPs fighting against a no-deal Brexit concerning the best plan, with some wanting to move straight to a no-confidence vote and others believing a legislative route to prevent a disorderly exit is the best option. There is no agreement over who should lead a caretaker government \u2013 whether Corbyn or a veteran figure such as Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman. Nor is there agreement about what an extension to article 50 would be used for, such as a general election or second referendum. A number of Conservatives and independent MPs have said they could not support Corbyn as leader of a caretaker government but the Labour leader has insisted he is the only suitable candidate for that role. Labour insiders said the party was feeling under increasing pressure to bring an early no-confidence vote soon after parliament returns even if it is not winnable yet, as it could show the prime minister just how close he is to losing control of No 10 by pursuing a no-deal Brexit. Meanwhile, rebel Conservative MPs are still working on legislative ways to mandate an extension to article 50, but some are despairing over whether that is possible and have been returning to examining ways to go back to Theresa May\u2019s deal to test support for it against a no-deal Brexit. Today Nick Boles, the former Tory-turned-independent MP who was invited to the Corbyn meeting, has released the text of his reply, explaining why he won\u2019t be attending. The letter is interesting because it illustrates very well some of the divisions that Rowena was explaining. 1) No confidence vote? Many opposition MPs, and even some Tories think that the best way to stop Boris Johnson implementing a no-deal Brexit is to bring down his government through a no-confidence vote. But Boles disagrees, and he says he would not support such a vote while it remains possible that Johnson could achieve a Brexit deal. 2) Interim government leader? Corbyn argues that he should lead any interim government set up following a successful no-confidence vote. Boles says that he would never support such a government, and that several other opposition MPs feel the same way. 3) Legislating to require the PM to request an article 50 extension? Earlier this year MPs passed a bill tabled by Yvette Cooper requiring Theresa May as PM to request an article 50 extension. But by that point May was already committed to requesting an extension. Boles wants to use similar legislation for force Johnson to request an extension. But other MPs opposed to no deal have doubts about this strategy. It is not at all clear how binding legislation like this would be, in practical terms, on a PM who did not want comply. (For example, he could request an extension, but only half-heartedly.) And the bill would not compel the EU to agree to offer an extension. 4) An early election? Boles argues that, to prevent the bill requiring him to seek an article 50 extension becoming law, Johnson would try to trigger an early election, to take place shortly after a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. No 10 has reportedly decided that, in those circumstances, it would ignore calls to delay Brexit pending the result of the election. Boles says an early election would only happen if Labour MPs were to vote for it, and he urges Corbyn to rule that out. But Corbyn\u2019s strategy for avoiding a no-deal Brexit depends on holding a no-confidence vote that could result in an early election (if Johnson were to lose the vote, and no alternative government were to get a majority within 14 days.) Mujtaba Rahman, the former European commission official who does Brexit analysis for the Eurasia consultancy, has a good take on the exchanges. Here are the main points from what Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and Boris Johnson said in their opening statements and Q&amp;A. Macron said the key features of the withdrawal agreement were \u201cindispensable\u201d. He said: I would like to say that the key elements of this agreement, including the Irish backstop, are not just technical constraints or legal quibbling, but indeed genuine, indispensable guarantees to preserve stability in Ireland [and] to preserve the integrity of the single market, which is the foundation of the European project. He said that any new version of the withdrawal agreement proposed by the UK would have to be very similar to the existing one for it to be acceptable to the EU. He said: We will not find a new withdrawal agreement within 30 days that will be very different from the existing one. He identified the \u201ctwo goals\u201d of the backstop that were non-negotiable. He said: The Irish backstop, as we call it, is a point that has been negotiated in the context of the geography of Ireland and the past political situation. So it is an important element that allows us first of all to guarantee the stability in Ireland and also the integrity of the single market. These are our two goals. When you talk about flexibility, well let me be very clear with you, these two goals have to be met. We therefore have to find a solution that guarantees the integrity of the single market. We have to be able to guarantee to companies, to citizens and consumers in Europe that comply with the rules of the European Union and whatever comes from a market that is not in the European Union is controlled. He backed what Angela Merkel said yesterday about the need for the UK to come up with an alternative to the backstop within 30 days. But he played down the idea that this amounted to a new timetable, arguing that in practice it would be impossible to wait until the end of October before deciding if a no-deal Brexit could be avoided. He explained: What Angela Merkel said yesterday and which is very much in line with the discussions we have had since the very beginning is that we need visibility in 30 days. I believe that this also matches the goal of Prime Minister Johnson. No one will wait until October 31 to find the right solution. He said it would be possible to find a solution by the middle of next month if there was goodwill on both sides. We should all together be able to find something smart within 30 days if there is goodwill on both sides. He also said the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, could be involved in finding an answer \u201cwithout totally reshuffling the withdrawal agreement\u201d. He played down the idea that he was the hard man in the Brexit process. He explained: I\u2019ve always been presented as the hard boy in the group but it\u2019s just that I have always been clear: a choice was made and we cannot just ignore it. We have to implement a decision taken by the British people. Johnson said that he had been \u201cpowerfully encouraged\u201d by his talks in Berlin last night about the prospects of reaching a deal. I want to make it absolutely clear to you Emmanuel \u2013 to the French people \u2013 that of course I want a deal. I think we can get a deal and a good deal. I was powerfully encouraged by our conversations last night in Berlin with our mutual friends. I know that with energy and creativity and application we can find a way forward for all our businesses and our citizens. He also said it was \u201cvery interesting to hear some of the positive noises that we\u2019re now hearing about the ways that [replacing the backstop] can be done\u201d. And this what some journalists and commentators are saying about the Q&amp;A. From AFP\u2019s Adam Plowright From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn From my colleague Dan Sabbagh From Barron\u2019s Group\u2019s Pierre Brian\u00e7on From the Institute for Government\u2019s Georgina Wright Here we go again; just as when Boris Johnson met Angela Merkel in Berlin last night, his opening public exchanges with Emmanuel Macron were warm \u2013 and considerably friendlier than some of their comments about each other in the past (see 9.25am) \u2013 but there was nothing in what Macron said to suggest that a solution to the backstop quandary is any closer than it has been for months. Macron suggested that he was unhappy about being cast as the \u201chard man\u201d in the process. But he was also very clear that a mechanism was needed to protect the Northern Ireland peace process and the integrity of the single market, and he said any version of the withdrawal agreement drawn up by Johnson within the next 30 days that might be acceptable to the EU would be much the same as the one already on the table. There are polite ways of saying no, and harsh ways of saying no, and Merkel and Macron (in their public remarks, at least) have been charm personified. But four weeks ago Johnson was telling Merkel and Macron that the backstop would have go for a Brexit deal to be possible. This week, they are telling him, that on the fundamentals of what the backstop is all about, they are not willing to budge. For obvious reasons, Johnson is keen to put a positive gloss on all of this, telling journalists at the Q&amp;A that he came away from Berlin \u201cpowerfully encouraged\u201d. But, as students of Johnson\u2019s journalistic career know all too well, his analysis of developments in the EU has never been noted for its accuracy ... Macron says Angela Merkel said yesterday there would have to be \u201cvisibility\u201d within 30 days as to what an alternative to the backstop might look like. People would not wait until 31 October for a solution, he says. He says Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, will be involved in talks. He says, if there is goodwill on both sides, there could be a solution. He says he is presented as the hard man in the negotiations. But he wants a solution. However, he has been clear that we will not find a new withdrawal agreement within 30 days that will be very different to the existing one. He says the agreement could be amended, though. Johnson says he admires Merkel\u2019s \u201ccan do\u201d spirit. He says he thinks solutions to the backstop problem are available. He repeats the point about how the UK will not impose checks at the border. Q: What is the alternative to the backstop? Johnson says the reporter should read \u201can excellent paper\u201d produced by Greg Hands and other MPs proposing alternatives. (That is a reference to the Alternative Arrangements Commission report.) Johnson ends by saying: \u201cWhere there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way.\u201d And that\u2019s it. Q: Isn\u2019t a no-deal Brexit a bit of a con? Johnson says a great deal of work has already been done to ensure that the transition on 31 October will be as smooth as it can be. He says he wants to ensure all the remaining necessary work gets done before the end of October. Q: Angela Merkel showed some flexibility in Berlin last night. Shouldn\u2019t you too? Macron says the Irish backstop has been negotiated, and it is an important element that guarantees stability in Ireland and the integrity of the single market. As for flexibility, these two goals must be met. He says the EU has to guarantee to its citizens that its market will be controlled. Johnson intervenes. He says under no circumstances will the UK government impose checks at the border. He understands the EU desire to protect the integrity of the single market. But he thinks that can be protected, while allowing the UK to leave. Boris Johnson starts with Brexit. He says he wants to make it clear that he wants a deal, and he thinks he can get a deal. He says he was \u201cpowerfully encouraged\u201d by his talks with Angela Merkel last night. But it is vital, if you have a referendum, that you do what the voters voted for. He says the UK will come out with a deal or without one. He says the UK-French relationship is extraordinary. Their troops are side by side in countries like Mali and Estonia. And it was the British and French, together with the Americans, who responded when President Assad used chemical weapons in Syria. He says the UK and France will work hand in glove at the G7 on issues like climate change and the environment. Whatever happens with Brexit, it is their joint ambition to deepen the UK/French relationship. He says French buses run on London roads. And TGV, the French trains, run on steel made in the UK. And London is one of the cities with the biggest French populations on earth, he says. Let\u2019s get Brexit done, and let\u2019s get it done \u201csensibly and pragmatically\u201d, he says. Emmanuel Macron starts. He says he is pleased to welcome Boris Johnson to Paris. But they have spoken on the phone already. He says the relationship between the two countries is central and immutable. He says it\u2019s a privileged relationship. The two countries have a long history. They have treaties that go beyond the EU. He says the engagement of both countries has always been constant. He says, inevitably, they will talk about Brexit. He says Johnson knows his position. He says he regrets the choice by the UK to leave. If he had been a British voter, he would have voted to stay. But the decision must be implemented, he says. He says he wants to ensure the EU is protected. The EU has negotiated an agreement with the UK. It is not up to an one EU country to renegotiate it. The key elements are indispensable. It is about preserving peace in Northern Ireland, and about preserving the integrity of the single market. He says, as a friend and ally of the UK, it is up to the UK alone to decide its destiny. France is preparing for all eventualities, he says. He says, no matter what, the future of the UK cannot but be European. Our geography speaks by itself. Macron ends by saying again how pleased he is to welcome Johnson. Boris Johnson has arrived. Emmanuel Macron is on the steps of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e waiting for Boris Johnson to arrive. Here is the scene outside the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron are expected to take two questions \u2013 one from a French journalist and one from a British journalist. Boris Johnson is due to arrive at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace shortly. There is a live feed at the top of this blog. During the Tory leadership contest Boris Johnson claimed (implausibly) that the chances of a no-deal Brexit were a million to one. Subsequently he has admitted it is more likely than that, but he has not gone as far as David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, who told the Today programme this morning that he thought the odds on that outcome were now \u201c50/50\u201d. It was now \u201ca high probability\u201d, Davis said. But Davis also insisted that the dangers of a no-deal Brexit had been overblown. Dismissing the claims in the Operation Yellowhammer document leaked at the weekend as \u201crubbish\u201d, Davis said: I think there will be some turbulence. There will be some bumpiness in terms of cross-border traffic and so on. When it was put to him that in the past he has said a no-deal Brexit would lead to nothing that a reasonably competent government would not be able to handle, he replied: \u201cThat\u2019s precisely what I think.\u201d The recently-appointed Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, has ignited a furious row with the Scottish National party after claiming it was no different from other nationalist movements as it \u201cneeds an enemy to thrive\u201d. In an article for the Times (paywall), his first newspaper opinion piece since being appointed by Boris Johnson, Jack wrote: Scottish nationalists like to claim that theirs is a different kind of nationalism, somehow uniquely benign. I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m not sure I can spot the difference. Like nationalist movements the world over, it requires an enemy to make it thrive. It needs an \u2018other\u2019 to rail against. Jack, a staunch Brexiteer, accused Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP of inventing grievances; using \u201cthe Westminster system\u201d as an insult coded to attack the UK as a whole; and inventing a \u201cfiction\u201d that devolution no longer works. He said many fiercely proud Scots were comfortable being Scottish and British. Acknowledging the Brexit crisis was putting the union under strain, he blamed Sturgeon using \u201canger, bitterness and resentment\u201d over Brexit to promote independence. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, called on Jack to withdraw the piece on Twitter. Some SNP figures worry about the labelling. Humza Yousaf, Holyrood\u2019s most successful non-white MSP, and now the SNP\u2019s justice secretary, said last week at an Edinburgh fringe event he disliked the \u201cnational\u201d in its name. I do struggle with it, because people do associate it with all the various elements of nationalism that exist. [I] think people understand that we are an open and inclusive party. But do I think that the name can present us with some challenges? For sure. Libby Brooks, the Guardian\u2019s Scotland correspondent, said Sturgeon had addressed this point at another Fringe event the previous day. In 2017, Sturgeon said she would prefer another one but last week claimed to be \u201c100% comfortable\u201d with it. Other nationalist parties, she said, were not seeking independence like hers but were nationalist in an exclusive, xenophobic sense. She said: Scottish independence is not just at the other end of the spectrum of that, but on another spectrum altogether. The SNP today is and I think I can say it without fear of justifiable contradiction, the most pro-immigration party in the UK which is not what you would expect of a nationalist party, so my nationalism is rooted in a desire to make the country I live in as good as it can be. Last night I posted a summary of the immediate media reaction to the Angela Merkel/Boris Johnson press conference here. The pro-Brexit papers in the UK have put a positive gloss on what happened, with the Sun story, under the headline \u201cWe can Merk it out\u201d, saying that Johnson was delighted with the outcome, and the Daily Mail, the Daily Telegraph and the Daily Express all splashing on stories implying the prospect of a no-deal Brexit has been reduced. But informed commentators are not so sure. Here is another round-up of what journalists and commentators have been saying about the significance of what was said at the Berlin press conference after they\u2019ve had a bit of time to mull it over. From the Guardian\u2019s Philip Oltermann From Politico Europe\u2019s Matthew Karnitschnig From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From Berlin Policy Journal\u2019s Henning Hoff From the Economist\u2019s Sophie Pedder From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall From my colleague Jennifer Rankin From the Telegraph\u2019s Peter Foster Boris Johnson received a more cordial welcome than he might have expected last night when he met the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Berlin on his first trip abroad as PM. But today he is in Paris for lunch with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and their exchanges might be considerably more prickly. Macron has repeatedly accused the leave campaign, that Johnson led, of lying to the British public, of all the main EU leaders he has been least willing to make concessions to the UK over Brexit, and yesterday, in a two-and-a-half hour briefing with journalists (not mainly about Johnson \u2013 the UK is not that important to France \u2013 it was a marathon event because Macron is hosting the G7 summit at the weekend) Macron delivered two very unpalatable messages for his British counterpart. Macron said that renegotiating the EU withdrawal agreement was \u201cnot an option\u201d. Johnson says, without a renegotiation, there will be no Brexit deal. Macron suggested that Brexit would stop the UK being a great power. This was particularly provocative because Johnson claims that Brexit will enhance the UK\u2019s independence and prestige. But Macron argued that Brexit would leave the UK dependent on the US. He said: The British are attached to being a great power, a member of the security council. The point can\u2019t be to exit Europe and say \u2018we\u2019ll be stronger\u2019, before in the end, becoming the junior partner of the United States, which are acting more and more hegemonically. In a particularly neat twist, using the language of Brexiters to contest one of the main claims of the Brexit project, Macron even suggested that outside the EU, instead of being released from European vassalage, Britain would end up a vassal state of the US. Can the cost for Britain of a hard Brexit \u2013 because Britain will be the main victim \u2013 be offset by the United States of America? No. And even if it were a strategic choice it would be at the cost of a historic vassalisation of Britain. I don\u2019t think this is what Boris Johnson wants. I don\u2019t think it is what the British people want. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the will of the British people \u2026 to become the junior partner of the US. There are more accounts of what Macron said at his briefing at the Guardian, at HuffPost, at Politico Europe and at Reuters. My colleague Angelique Chrisafis has written a preview of the Macron/Johnson meeting which has some very good background on their relationship. Here is an extract. Johnson began pinpointing France as a problem long before he became PM. While being filmed for a documentary last year when he was foreign secretary, he said of France: \u201cWhy are they trying to shaft us?\u201d He called France \u201cnaughty children\u201d on the issue of Europe. He later denied he had called the French \u201cturds\u201d over Brexit. Johnson is well known in Paris for what the local media call his \u201cFrench-bashing\u201d for a domestic audience, notably as London mayor when he said his city\u2019s bike scheme was a Rolls-Royce to Paris\u2019s Citro\u00ebn 2CV. He said the Socialist government at the time, with its proposed high tax rate on the very rich, had been \u201ccaptured by sans-culottes\u201d running a \u201ctyranny\u201d of the like not seen since the French Revolution. \u201cTo be popular in the UK, do you always have to criticise the French?\u201d one French interviewer asked him as mayor. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he replied, saying he loved France. And here is her full article. Johnson is due to meet Macron at 12pm UK time. They are not due to hold a press conference, but both leaders are expected to make short statements to the media. Otherwise the diary is relatively light today. At 9.30am the Office for National Statistics is publishing migration figures, and at some point Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, is chairing the first meeting of the Freeports advisory panel. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news.

If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.

      "body": "<p>On the last night of March 2012, Justin Trudeau climbed into a boxing ring in downtown Ottawa, the Canadian capital, intent on rescuing his public image. He was clad in a lustrous red robe, the colour of the Liberal party, for which he was then a junior member of parliament. In the opposite corner, wearing Tory blue, was a young aboriginal leader and Conservative senator named Patrick Brazeau, who is a former navy reservist and a second-degree black belt in karate. Bookies had given the lanky Trudeau, a former high school teacher, three-to-one odds against.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/jul/28/justin-trudeau-and-senator-patrick-brazeau-face-off-in-2012-boxing-match-video\" title=\"\">televised match</a> was ostensibly a fundraiser for cancer research, but in Ottawa it became a sensation \u2013 a display of partisan pageantry rarely seen in the staid world of Canadian politics, where \u201cbland works\u201d had been the watchword of one long-serving provincial premier. The fight\u2019s symbolism was lost on no one: in recent years, the Conservatives had battered the Liberals, turning a narrow lead in the 2006 election into a majority government by 2011. The Liberal party, which had governed Canada for much of the 20th century, had been reduced to a historically low number of seats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/sep/09/justin-trudeau-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-political-brand-podcast\">Justin Trudeau: the rise and fall of a political brand \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trudeau ranked among the best hopes for resuscitating the Liberals and leading them back into power. But his political career, which began in earnest four years earlier, had been dogged by criticisms that he lacked substance and was riding on the coattails of his father, Pierre Trudeau, one of Canada\u2019s longest-serving prime ministers. Barbra Streisand, a former lover of Pierre\u2019s, once described him as a blend of \u201cMarlon Brando and Napoleon\u201d. In contrast, one critic had memorably dubbed Justin \u201cthe Paris Hilton of Canadian politics\u201d. A triumphant bout in the ring could help erode this perception, Trudeau figured. \u201cNever underestimate the power of symbols in today\u2019s world,\u201d he told a documentary film <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/143909623\" title=\"\">crew chronicling the fight</a>.</p> <p>Within seconds of the opening bell, Brazeau pinned Trudeau against the ropes with an onslaught of heavy jabs. But the Conservative senator soon exhausted himself. Early in the second round, Trudeau seized on the opening, raining down blows on Brazeau. Less than a minute into the third round, as the Liberal MP continued to pummel his opponent, the referee halted the fight and declared Trudeau the winner.</p> <p>That victory was one of the first major triumphs in a branding campaign that helped to transform Trudeau from a politician widely derided as a lightweight into a global political superstar. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t random,\u201d Trudeau told Rolling Stone in 2017, referring to the boxing match. \u201cI wanted someone who would be a good foil, and we stumbled upon the scrappy, tough-guy senator from an Indigenous community \u2026 I saw it as the right kind of narrative, the right story to tell.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/jul/28/justin-trudeau-and-senator-patrick-brazeau-face-off-in-2012-boxing-match-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/7v2n9\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"3722175\"            data-video-name=\"Justin Trudeau and Senator Patrick Brazeau face off in 2012 boxing match  \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"LCN Canada\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-597a7d17e4b0cc197665c141\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12331576&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12331576&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12331576&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/jul/28/justin-trudeau-and-senator-patrick-brazeau-face-off-in-2012-boxing-match-video\">Justin Trudeau and Senator Patrick Brazeau face off in 2012 boxing match</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In the weeks after the fight, the Canadian media, which had previously portrayed the Liberal MP as a \u201creed-thin, pedigreed Dauphin\u201d, began lauding Trudeau as a public figure of \u201ctoughness, strength, honour and courage\u201d, noted Elise Maiolino, then a PhD candidate in sociology at the University of Toronto, after analysing hundreds of news articles. That change in perception electrified Trudeau\u2019s career, helping to set him on a path to become leader of the Liberal party the following year. Two years after that, in 2015, the Liberals made an unprecedented leap from third-party status to a majority government \u2013 and Trudeau became, like his father before him, the prime minister of Canada.</p> <p>The sort of potent spectacle that characterised his fight with Brazeau was, until recently, a hallmark of Trudeau\u2019s tenure as prime minister. Like Barack Obama, Trudeau seemed to understand better than other politicians how to adapt the old ideas of political marketeering to the new realities of social media. He was a master of the viral video clip or poignant photo that seemed to express the worthiness of his government and the virtue of his politics. He became, as a flurry of academic research has put it, the first prime minister of the Instagram age. \u201cI think he\u2019s probably the best national leader since Ronald Reagan at projecting a certain image,\u201d says Warren Kinsella, a former Liberal strategist.</p> <p>Trudeau has championed a vision of Canada as a nation friendly to allies, open to immigrants and just to its people. According to this image, Canada is a paragon of progressivism in an era marked by strains of authoritarian populism \u2013 as if crossing the border that separates Canada from Donald Trump\u2019s US means travelling through a political looking-glass. And yet, Trudeau was never exactly anti-populist: he cultivated an impression that he both serves the masses and is adored by them.</p> <p>Ironically, but perhaps inevitably, Trudeau\u2019s efforts to depict himself in this way have now helped to set the stage for his potential unmaking. Some of the policies enacted by Trudeau\u2019s government have made his political identity seem hollow, even disingenuous. Compounding this has been the ongoing fallout from the most significant controversy of his tenure: Canada\u2019s ethics watchdog recently found that Trudeau broke the country\u2019s conflict of interest law in the hopes of allowing a giant engineering and construction firm to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/14/trudeau-broke-ethics-law-in-snc-lavalin-case-watchdog-rules\" title=\"\">avoid a corruption trial</a>. The company is facing charges in connection with millions of dollars in bribes allegedly paid to officials in Libya, including members of the Gaddafi regime, between 2001 and 2011.</p> <p>Far from the progressive, transparent government that Trudeau sold to Canadians and the global media, the scandal suggests that, like previous Canadian governments, Trudeau\u2019s administration remains in thrall to the \u201cLaurentian consensus\u201d \u2013 the web of political, business and intellectual elites in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal whose collective name is a nod to eastern Canada\u2019s mighty St Lawrence river. Ahead of a federal election in October, Trudeau\u2019s approval ratings have plunged from a high of 65% in 2016 to about 32% in July, leaving him vulnerable to becoming the first Canadian prime minister since the 1930s to lose a bid for re-election after winning only one majority mandate.</p> <p>\u201cBrand Trudeau was squeaky clean and fresh and new and a different kind of politics,\u201d says Shachi Kurl, a pollster from the Angus Reid Institute. \u201cAnd it\u2019s turned out that Brand Trudeau is: \u2018Welcome to the new politics, just like the old politics.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In an age of constant and intimate exposure to celebrities, it may seem unsurprising that the head of government of a country containing less than half of 1% of the world\u2019s population should be so familiar. But how many other Canadian prime ministers have been profiled in the New York Times Magazine, Vogue and Rolling Stone? How many other Canadian prime ministers can most non-Canadians even name, let alone call to mind an image of? </p> <p>One of the extraordinary things about Trudeau is that he is famous in part because he is Canadian \u2013 a remarkably rare kind of fame. Most Canadians who are famous outside of the country have been processed through Hollywood or the US-dominated recording industry. Part of Trudeau\u2019s appeal within Canada, then, is that he assuaged a dual sense of cultural insecurity and superiority, especially with regard to the country\u2019s belligerent southern neighbour. (The majority of Canadians see Trudeau\u2019s fame as a net benefit to the country, according to the Angus Reid Institute.) On the global stage he presented a sort of ideal form \u2013 likable, handsome, virtuous \u2013 in which the country could see its best self.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trudeau\u2019s distinctly Canadian appeal goes even deeper. The prime minister represents a potent idea of Canada and what it means to the world. This idea is perhaps best summed up by a campaign motto of Trudeau\u2019s father, from the late 1960s: \u201cThe just society.\u201d The idea was sold to Canadians as encompassing the protection of civil rights, economic opportunity for all, scientific remedies to environmental problems, greater autonomy for Indigenous people in Canada, and a country in which the language rights of both French and English were enshrined.</p> <p>A great deal of Trudeau\u2019s political cachet within Canada has been inherited from his father. Pierre is a towering figure in Canadian history, who liberalised laws on abortion and homosexuality, entrenched a charter of universal rights and instituted official bilingualism. The Canadian mass media guru Marshall McLuhan, a friendly adviser to Pierre throughout the 15 years he was prime minister, believed that Canada had no fixed identity, giving Pierre an opportunity to act as its \u201cunifying image\u201d. Canada could, in a sense, become what Pierre made it. Even if few Canadians subscribe to McLuhan\u2019s view, it captures something central to how Pierre framed his own tenure as prime minister.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"654b710dfd7d73aba180ca50b070be9b1a551a63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/654b710dfd7d73aba180ca50b070be9b1a551a63/0_0_2892_2278/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Queen with Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau, father of Justin, in London in 1977.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"788\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Queen with Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau, father of Justin, in London in 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Goode/Toronto Star via Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The craze for Justin Trudeau during the first years of his prime ministership echoed the \u201cTrudeaumania\u201d of his father\u2019s ascent to power. Pierre, too, captured attention around the world by staging moments of spectacle \u2013 whether it was sliding down a bannister during his 1968 campaign for Liberal leader or pirouetting behind the Queen at Buckingham Palace in 1977. Pierre was \u201cpackaged and presented as a debonair anti-politician who drove sports cars and spent time with pretty women\u201d, writes Alex Marland, a scholar of Canadian political branding at Memorial University. \u201cTo cultivate an image of a pop culture phenomenon\u201d during Canada\u2019s 1968 federal election, he adds, \u201cLiberal strategists recruited young Liberal women to behave as obsessed fanatics\u201d when Pierre was in the presence of reporters.</p> <p>Justin\u2019s attempts to recreate Trudeaumania have involved wading through crowds to allow fans to snap selfies with him \u2013 while his official photographer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B03zcs7AqZL/\" title=\"\">captures the moment</a> at a slight distance. The results, posted on Instagram, feel like a record of spontaneous adulation, but are actually tightly controlled. As Marland puts it, Trudeau is executing a \u201csimilar playbook\u201d to his father\u2019s, but \u201cin different technological terrain\u201d.</p> <p>Outside the country, Trudeau has played to the world\u2019s eagerness to imagine Canada as a northern utopia untouched by the forces of nationalism and xenophobia. Within the country, however, there are many who think that Liberal Canada has never been the progressive place that Pierre and Justin tried to make it seem. The question now is whether voters believe his son has delivered more than just a good narrative.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When a political brand becomes as powerful as Trudeau\u2019s has, it is tempting to read a person\u2019s entire biography as a branding exercise. Things the politician did in their life before politics become plot points in a success story devised by a canny political operator. Ian Capstick, a political commentator who has worked for the Liberals as well as their rivals to the left, the New Democratic party, believes that Trudeau and his longtime friend and adviser Gerald Butts \u201chave been carefully calculating every single entree of Mr Trudeau into Canadian public life for the past 30 years\u201d. He adds: \u201cThere is not a single action that he took publicly that wasn\u2019t considered, reconsidered and put out there in an attempt to eventually build the base that he would require to be prime minister.\u201d</p> <p>Even if this view is a little too cynical, there is no doubt that living his entire life in the public eye has endowed Trudeau with an instinctive, if not infallible, sense of political optics. The beginning of his rise to power has usually been dated to 3 October 2000, when the 28-year-old delivered a dramatic televised eulogy at his father\u2019s state funeral, closing with the words \u201cJe t\u2019aime, papa\u201d, before resting his head on his father\u2019s flag-draped coffin, his tears falling freely. Switchboards at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation lit up with more than 1,000 requests to replay the tribute.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9122d0f69b7371c317760dd106fef263ce918fee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9122d0f69b7371c317760dd106fef263ce918fee/0_0_2048_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Trudeau (third from right) and other family members at his father Pierre Trudeau\u2019s state funeral in Montreal in 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justin Trudeau and other family members at his father Pierre Trudeau\u2019s state funeral in Montreal in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Best/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Immediately, there was talk of the younger Trudeau entering politics, but many observers felt he lacked gravitas. He had spent his mid-20s drifting between stints as a bar bouncer and snowboard instructor before becoming a schoolteacher. He even admitted, or pretended, to an ignorance of current affairs. \u201cI don\u2019t read the newspapers, I don\u2019t watch the news,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/justin-trudeau-like-his-peers-seeks-politics-without-politics/article1337650/\" title=\"\">he wrote</a> in the Globe and Mail the year after his father\u2019s death. \u201cI figure, if something important happens, someone will tell me.\u201d</p> <p>Trudeau finally entered politics in 2007, when he began running for parliament in the riding of Papineau, a multicultural district in Montreal, which was represented at the time by a Quebec-nationalist party. During the election in 2008, he grasped something in miniature that Obama demonstrated on a larger scale that same year: that a political brand is not sufficient in and of itself \u2013 you also need a political operation. (Trump, who may not have had much of a grassroots campaign by comparison, is proof of how far such operations have moved to social media.) Trudeau won after mounting a year-long effort to knock on doors and shake hands in the district.</p> <p>It was an impressive start, but Trudeau\u2019s subsequent four years as an MP were generally seen as insipid. It wasn\u2019t until his rout of the Conservative senator Brazeau in the boxing match in 2012 that the larger political tide began to turn for him. Three years later, Trudeau\u2019s fight to become prime minister made his father\u2019s brand his own.</p> <p>In the 2015 general election, Trudeau married the values of the just society with the electoral approach pioneered by Obama, building the infrastructure for a grassroots effort while mounting an aggressive social media campaign. But Trudeau relied more heavily than Obama could on images. \u201cObama\u2019s use of social media was, for lack of a better term, pre-visual,\u201d says Tamara Small, a political science professor at Ontario\u2019s University of Guelph.</p> <p>The election pitted Trudeau against Stephen Harper, a dour Conservative who had governed Canada for nearly a decade. Few expected much of Trudeau, the neophyte leader of Canada\u2019s third-ranked party. \u201cI think that if he comes on stage with his pants on, he will probably exceed expectations,\u201d a Conservative spokesperson told reporters before the first debate. In one famous attack advert, Conservatives labelled Trudeau as \u201cjust not ready\u201d, while mockingly conceding that he has \u201cnice hair, though\u201d.</p> <p>But many Canadians already felt a deep connection to Trudeau. \u201cHe has grown up in the public eye. He was literally born while his father was prime minister,\u201d Marland told me. \u201cHe was a celebrity before he even became prime minister.\u201d This made Trudeau seem regal, yet familiar \u2013 a brand you knew and could trust. Trudeau\u2019s team did everything they could to encourage this intimate connection with their candidate. \u201cIt was probably Canada\u2019s first celebrity politics federal election,\u201d says Huguette Young, a veteran Ottawa journalist and author of Justin Trudeau: The Natural Heir. \u201cThey had Dinner with Justin, just like Dinner with Obama, and contests and you could win a date with Justin. He was almost commodified as a product.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4719792fa0470a4f130758ef780cf66a0ca579dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4719792fa0470a4f130758ef780cf66a0ca579dd/0_0_3500_2314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Trudeau at an election rally in Ottawa in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trudeau at an election rally in Ottawa in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Doyle/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cTrudeau really built his brand in order to counter the brand of Harper,\u201d says Vincent Raynauld, a professor at Boston\u2019s Emerson College who studies Canadian politics. In contrast to his opponent, who was seen as icy and remote, Trudeau promised a return to \u201csunny ways\u201d \u2013 the motto of a much-admired prime minister from the turn of the 20th century. While Harper mooted banning the niqab at Canadian citizenship ceremonies and launching a hotline to ferret out what his party called \u201cbarbaric cultural practices\u201d, Trudeau made a passionate defence of multiculturalism and immigration.</p> <p>These were only two of the areas in which Trudeau promised to \u201cdo politics differently\u201d. In a country where women make up just 26% of MPs, he promised to usher in a new age of gender equality \u2013 beginning by naming a cabinet comprised of as many women as men. In what would have constituted a direct challenge to his own party\u2019s dominance, Trudeau pledged to make space for smaller political parties by reforming Canada\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system. He vowed to reset the country\u2019s relationship with its disproportionately disadvantaged Indigenous peoples. All in all, the Liberal manifesto made 353 specific policy promises.</p> <p>After almost a decade of Harper, there was a widespread desire for change. Presented with two very different images of Canada\u2019s future, voters responded with a clear answer. On 19 October 2015, the Liberal party swept back to power by picking up 148 seats on top of the 36 they already held in Canada\u2019s 338-member parliament. It was the largest increase in seats in Canadian history.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>As Trudeau took office, his focus on optics was on full display. The often sedate swearing-in of a new government was thrown open to the public and turned into a highly stage-managed, live-streamed event. Trudeau was due to arrive by coach at the prime minister\u2019s official residence, 24 Sussex Drive, where he spent his childhood. (The house has been under renovation since Trudeau took office, and he and his family have been living in a 22-room guest house nearby.) To avoid any inelegant photos or video \u2013 \u201cGetting off a bus is such an ugly shot,\u201d Trudeau told his communications director that morning, in comments captured by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation \u2013 Trudeau\u2019s team misled the media about where they should meet the new prime minister, ensuring that the first images the press got were of him strolling from 24 Sussex to the governor general\u2019s official residence, Rideau Hall, where the ceremony would take place. At another point that morning, Trudeau and his team were preparing to respond to the question of why he was appointing a gender-balanced cabinet. \u201cI think just calling people\u2019s attention to the year is all you really need to say,\u201d Gerald Butts, Trudeau\u2019s right-hand man, told him. The advice yielded one of Trudeau\u2019s most internationally famous lines: \u201cBecause it\u2019s 2015.\u201d</p> <p>Around the same time, Trudeau\u2019s team was courting international attention, prioritising interviews with the New York Times and a sultry photoshoot for Vogue with his wife, Sophie, over interviews with Canadian media. \u201cThat was very, very deliberate,\u201d said Susan Delacourt, a journalist at the Toronto Star. \u201cThere was a sense that Canadians would like that.\u201d Many Canadians initially did, interpreting the attention as a sign of Trudeau\u2019s place among progressive world leaders at a time when Obama was still president and Hillary Clinton seemed poised to succeed him, Delacourt added.</p> <p>Trudeau moved his official photographer into an office two doors down from his own. A mix of intimate and public photo ops \u2013 of the prime minister cuddling with pandas, greeting Syrian refugees as they landed on Canadian soil, throwing punches in a Brooklyn boxing gym \u2013 transformed Trudeau from a politician into a series of memes. During his first year in power, barely a week went by without some sort of viral moment from the prime minister that found its way into people\u2019s daily lives as they scrolled through Snapchat on the bus or perused Instagram in bed. As Trudeau content appeared on social media shorn of context, it created new realities: a rehearsed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2016/apr/16/justin-trudeau-and-quantum-computers\" title=\"\">explanation</a> of quantum computing became a show of Trudeau\u2019s intellectual prowess; an innocuous cough on a visit to Washington DC became an example of Trudeau trolling the president.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e43110b31f21ac73228ad289594ca7b03d77a527\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e43110b31f21ac73228ad289594ca7b03d77a527/0_234_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Trudeau posing with high school students while out jogging in Vancouver 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trudeau posing with high school students while out jogging in Vancouver 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters/Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A vital part of Trudeau\u2019s brand was the contrast between him and the far-right politicians gaining ground around the world. In the US, Trump was on a journey that in some ways echoed Trudeau\u2019s, parlaying his celebrity status into political power. When it came to optics, though, \u201cTrump was a gift\u201d for Trudeau, says Philippe Garneau, a corporate branding executive whose brother Marc ran against Trudeau for the Liberal leadership and is a minister in Trudeau\u2019s cabinet. \u201cI remember being worried. I said: \u2018How can we put a man who has a degree in teaching and [who taught] drama, sit him down with Angela Merkel and across from Putin?\u2019 And in walks Potus and upsets the whole apple cart,\u201d Garneau went on. \u201cSo Trudeau got lucky. He was never shown to be the youngest, newest, greenest member at the table, but rather some sort of version of youthful exuberance, enthusiasm, optimism and a lack of cynicism.\u201d</p> <p>When Trump pushed through his ban on travellers from a number of Muslim-majority countries, Trudeau tweeted that Canada would welcome those fleeing persecution, regardless of their faith. As accusations of sexual misconduct piled up against Trump, Trudeau proclaimed his own feminism in the pages of Marie Claire. As Trump vowed to put America first, Trudeau said Canada was \u201cback\u201d as a global player.</p> <p>Trudeau\u2019s contrast with Trump was successfully memefied when the two leaders met in February 2017. Trump\u2019s opening salvo with other world leaders had been an uncomfortably long, domineering handshake. Days earlier, Shinz\u014d Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, had been left reeling after a grip that dragged on for 19 seconds. Trudeau agonised for weeks about finding a technique that could show he was capable of holding his own, but which wouldn\u2019t antagonise the man now at the helm of Canada\u2019s largest trading partner.</p> <p>Eventually, he and his team decided on a combination handshake and shoulder grab. According to Politico, Trudeau and his senior aides spent part of their flight to Washington DC practising it. The rehearsal paid off: Trudeau was hailed around the world for the handshake <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/feb/14/donald-trumps-strange-handshake-style-and-how-justin-trudeau-beat-it-video-explainer\" title=\"\">he unleashed</a> on Trump. Viral videos of the seconds-long power struggle overshadowed a visit in which Trudeau stood by silently \u2013 later telling reporters that it was not his place to lecture another country \u2013 as Trump unapologetically defended his controversial travel ban.</p> <p>It was part of a pattern in which Trudeau and his team produced globally viral images that starved important political issues of oxygen. In 2017, at the height of an opioid epidemic that had claimed a record number of overdose victims in Vancouver, Trudeau\u2019s official photographer took an opportunistic photo of the prime minister running past a crowd of high schoolers on their prom night. Criticisms that the Trudeau government had not done enough to address the opioid crisis were buried by viral photos of the prime minister in running shorts and a T-shirt surrounded by students in suits and floor-length gowns. In politics, however, reality has a way of catching up with you. Eventually, the scandal, instead of the photo op, is what goes viral.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In retrospect, it seems predictable that a brand so well-devised, so symbolic and emotive, would encourage idealisations that in reality no politician could match. In 2018, some three years after Trudeau took power, cracks began showing in Trudeau\u2019s glossy veneer. In February, Trudeau and his family made an eight-day visit to India that was described to me by his former foreign policy adviser, Roland Paris, as perhaps \u201cthe worst trip that a Canadian prime minister has ever taken abroad\u201d. Although Trudeau sat down with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, and attended a handful of other bilateral meetings, what gained traction on social media were photos of the prime minister flouncing around in traditional Indian outfits. The result was a trip that seemed heavy on Bhangra moves but light on official business.</p> <p>\u201cIndia crystallised a lot of misgivings that liberals had that he was perhaps not as mature as we would like, he was not as prime ministerial as we would like, he was a little gimmicky and not taking it seriously with the world\u2019s largest democracy,\u201d Warren Kinsella, the former Liberal strategist, told me. Months later, Trudeau\u2019s feminist credentials took a hit after an allegation resurfaced that he had groped a reporter at an event in 2000. While acknowledging that he did apologise at the time to the reporter after she confronted him, Trudeau <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/06/trudeau-i-apologised-at-once-to-reporter-behind-groping-claim-canada-2000-music-festival\" title=\"\">has said</a> he is confident that he did not act inappropriately. Criticism grew that Trudeau\u2019s government was merely tinkering around the edges of change, masking their political inaction with a steady diet of unexpected moments and big talk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3cb7af74e118d5bb21473022ef5bbe8c3891b45e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cb7af74e118d5bb21473022ef5bbe8c3891b45e/0_0_3937_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trudeau with his wife and children in Amritsar, India in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trudeau with his wife and children in Amritsar, India in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Narinder Nanu/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done check box, check box, check box,\u201d says Celina Caesar-Chavannes, an MP and former parliamentary secretary to the prime minister who resigned from the Liberal caucus after a dispute with Trudeau. \u201cBut how does it really transform the lives of people who don\u2019t have Trudeau\u2019s privilege, who don\u2019t have my privilege?\u201d Caesar-Chavannes argues that Trudeau\u2019s government has made small changes but consistently shies away from the bold, transformational work he promised in a campaign built around the slogan, \u201cReal Change\u201d. \u201cI think there were some decisions around our ability to be re-elected as opposed to doing politics differently,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Caesar-Chavannes gave me a number of examples of this sort of policymaking. Trudeau\u2019s government legalised marijuana but rebuffed a call to expunge the records of those convicted of simple possession, even though prosecutions had disproportionately targeted people with low-incomes and Canadians of colour. Trudeau appointed a gender-balanced cabinet, but refused to reform the country\u2019s electoral system, which would have paved the way for more female lawmakers. He promised a \u201ctotal renewal\u201d of Canada\u2019s relationship with Indigenous communities, but his government has done little to address the mould-ridden housing and lack of clean drinking water that has left many Indigenous communities living in \u201cHaiti at -40C\u201d, as a politician from the New Democratic party has put it. After vowing to prioritise the fight against climate change and criticising Saudi Arabia\u2019s treatment of human rights advocates, Trudeau\u2019s government bought a C$4.5bn (\u00a32.8bn) pipeline to better transport Alberta\u2019s landlocked bitumen to international markets and signed off on the sale of more than 900 armoured vehicles to Riyadh. And, after much of the international hype over its welcoming stance on refugees had died down, the government quietly introduced legislation this April that makes it harder for some migrants to seek asylum.</p> <p>Despite Trudeau selling himself as an open and transparent leader, several sources within the government described the centralisation of power in his office, with the prime minister\u2019s inner circle playing the role of his gatekeepers. This is typical of highly branded politicians \u2013 the pressure to keep the whole government on message encourages top-down control \u2013 but Trudeau may have taken it to an extreme. St\u00e9phane Dion served as Trudeau\u2019s foreign minister for 14 months, and during that time he didn\u2019t manage to land a single one-on-one meeting with the prime minister despite multiple requests, says Jocelyn Coulon, a former senior policy advisor to Dion. (Dion declined my request for a comment.)</p> <p>Trudeau\u2019s supporters point to the ways in which he has lived up to his promises. Since 2015, more than 44,000 Syrian refugees have been settled in Canada, compared with the 2,300 that Stephen Harper\u2019s government took in between 2013 and 2015. Trudeau\u2019s tenure so far has seen 278,000 children lifted out of poverty, a feat credited to the country\u2019s buoyant economy as well as a marquee child-benefit programme that provides direct funds to the country\u2019s poorest families. The government raised taxes on the top 1%, while cutting income tax for those in the middle bracket. And, while Canada is expected to fall short of its target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030, Trudeau and his government have taken fledgling steps towards tackling climate change with legislation mandating a price on carbon in every province.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"108d1a6bf2b2098d66da3a40a8f331336e7ddd71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/108d1a6bf2b2098d66da3a40a8f331336e7ddd71/0_327_6123_3674/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trudeau facing questions from journalists in Ottawa in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trudeau facing questions from journalists in Ottawa in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lars Hagberg/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps Trudeau\u2019s shortcomings wouldn\u2019t have dominated public discussion in Canada for much of this year if a single large scandal hadn\u2019t focused Canadians on the gap between Trudeau the brand and his actions while in government. In February, Trudeau was accused of trying to bully his justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, into helping SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec-based engineering and construction company, avoid a corruption trial. Wilson-Raybould testified to a parliamentary committee earlier this year that Trudeau and his staff were worried that, if prosecuted, the company would move its head offices out of Montreal, potentially killing thousands of jobs and alienating voters in Quebec, home to a large number of strategically important parliamentary seats.</p> <p>Alongside the suggestion that Trudeau wanted to put his electoral success ahead of the integrity of the legal process, there was another layer to the scandal. Wilson-Raybould herself had once been a potent symbol of the Trudeau brand: she was the first Indigenous person and only the third woman to hold the post of justice minister. But the way she had been pressured by Trudeau and his team included \u201cundeniable elements of misogyny\u201d, she told the committee. Earlier this month, Canada\u2019s ethics commissioner concluded Trudeau had violated the country\u2019s ethics rules when he used his office to \u201ccircumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit\u201d Wilson-Raybould.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When Canadians head to the polls in October, a central question will be whether Trudeau\u2019s image is so badly tarnished that the Liberal party\u2019s vision of Canada will seem less appealing, and less realistic, than the vision on offer by the parties to its right and left. As things stand, Trudeau\u2019s main opponent is the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer. Scheer has vowed to roll back carbon taxes, opposed UN efforts to promote global cooperation on migration and wants to move Canada\u2019s embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He has also appointed a former board member of Rebel Media, a far-right website that has been described as Breitbart North, as his campaign manager.</p> <p>In order to hang on to votes in the diverse suburbs that ring Toronto, which have proven decisive in recent elections, Liberals have been highlighting Scheer\u2019s divisiveness on issues of race and immigration. Trudeau has also drawn attention to the Conservative party\u2019s poor record on the climate crisis, and there are signs that he will continue using Trump\u2019s presidency to reinforce his own image as a champion of the just society. His government recently struck a deal with California to reduce vehicle emissions, while Trudeau has vocally criticised new restrictions on abortion access in a number of Republican-controlled US states.</p> <p>The prime minister is also trying to repair the damage done to his reputation by the SNC-Lavalin scandal, and by the fact that he subsequently forced Wilson-Raybould and another cabinet minister, Jane Philpott, out of the Liberal caucus. \u201cWe worked really hard to try and see if there wasn\u2019t a way of continuing to move forward together,\u201d Trudeau told the audience at a Liberal fundraiser in June.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s completely incompatible with facts,\u201d Philpott told me. \u201cBetween 4 March when I resigned from cabinet and 2 April when I was booted out of caucus, I didn\u2019t have a single conversation with the prime minister. And I had only one phone call from someone in his office.\u201d She added: \u201cThere are times where the image and the narrative that the prime minister\u2019s office wants to put out there is more important than accuracy.\u201d</p> <p>Philpott likened this to another element of Trudeau\u2019s brand that had rung false to her as a former cabinet member: \u201cThe whole listening to women, \u2018diversity is our strength\u2019, that kind of image,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yet I didn\u2019t feel listened to, and my diverse views didn\u2019t feel like they had a place \u2013 those kinds of things were disappointing.\u201d Philpott is planning on running as an independent in the October election, and said she now had a \u201clovely freedom\u201d from the message control that had coloured all aspects of her job as a Liberal MP.</p> <p>Those behind Trudeau roundly reject the idea of the prime minister as a highly managed brand. \u201cAt the end of the day, he\u2019s not a Nike sneaker,\u201d says Kate Purchase, his executive director of communications and planning, whose responsibilities include vetting posts for his social media accounts. \u201cHe is a leader.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/20/emmanuel-macron-orbiting-jupiter-emmanuel-carrere\">Orbiting Jupiter: my week with Emmanuel Macron</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Purchase pointed to the issues Trudeau addresses, from the anxiety of the middle class to diversity and inclusion, to explain his meteoric rise on the world stage. \u201cThose are things that many governments are struggling with,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will always describe what they believe the brand to be, and what their version of the brand is, but at the end of the day, I think our brand is what we\u2019ve delivered.\u201d</p> <p>In recent weeks, polls suggest the Liberals have halted their plunge, and are slowly regaining some support. Still, an extraordinary challenge lies head for Trudeau and his team as they head into the October election, says the pollster Shachi Kurl. \u201cHow do you course-correct from something that is less about an event or a policy that people disagree with, and more about a broken brand?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On the last night of March 2012, Justin Trudeau climbed into a boxing ring in downtown Ottawa, the Canadian capital, intent on rescuing his public image. He was clad in a lustrous red robe, the colour of the Liberal party, for which he was then a junior member of parliament. In the opposite corner, wearing Tory blue, was a young aboriginal leader and Conservative senator named Patrick Brazeau, who is a former navy reservist and a second-degree black belt in karate. Bookies had given the lanky Trudeau, a former high school teacher, three-to-one odds against. The televised match was ostensibly a fundraiser for cancer research, but in Ottawa it became a sensation \u2013 a display of partisan pageantry rarely seen in the staid world of Canadian politics, where \u201cbland works\u201d had been the watchword of one long-serving provincial premier. The fight\u2019s symbolism was lost on no one: in recent years, the Conservatives had battered the Liberals, turning a narrow lead in the 2006 election into a majority government by 2011. The Liberal party, which had governed Canada for much of the 20th century, had been reduced to a historically low number of seats. Trudeau ranked among the best hopes for resuscitating the Liberals and leading them back into power. But his political career, which began in earnest four years earlier, had been dogged by criticisms that he lacked substance and was riding on the coattails of his father, Pierre Trudeau, one of Canada\u2019s longest-serving prime ministers. Barbra Streisand, a former lover of Pierre\u2019s, once described him as a blend of \u201cMarlon Brando and Napoleon\u201d. In contrast, one critic had memorably dubbed Justin \u201cthe Paris Hilton of Canadian politics\u201d. A triumphant bout in the ring could help erode this perception, Trudeau figured. \u201cNever underestimate the power of symbols in today\u2019s world,\u201d he told a documentary film crew chronicling the fight. Within seconds of the opening bell, Brazeau pinned Trudeau against the ropes with an onslaught of heavy jabs. But the Conservative senator soon exhausted himself. Early in the second round, Trudeau seized on the opening, raining down blows on Brazeau. Less than a minute into the third round, as the Liberal MP continued to pummel his opponent, the referee halted the fight and declared Trudeau the winner. That victory was one of the first major triumphs in a branding campaign that helped to transform Trudeau from a politician widely derided as a lightweight into a global political superstar. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t random,\u201d Trudeau told Rolling Stone in 2017, referring to the boxing match. \u201cI wanted someone who would be a good foil, and we stumbled upon the scrappy, tough-guy senator from an Indigenous community \u2026 I saw it as the right kind of narrative, the right story to tell.\u201d In the weeks after the fight, the Canadian media, which had previously portrayed the Liberal MP as a \u201creed-thin, pedigreed Dauphin\u201d, began lauding Trudeau as a public figure of \u201ctoughness, strength, honour and courage\u201d, noted Elise Maiolino, then a PhD candidate in sociology at the University of Toronto, after analysing hundreds of news articles. That change in perception electrified Trudeau\u2019s career, helping to set him on a path to become leader of the Liberal party the following year. Two years after that, in 2015, the Liberals made an unprecedented leap from third-party status to a majority government \u2013 and Trudeau became, like his father before him, the prime minister of Canada. The sort of potent spectacle that characterised his fight with Brazeau was, until recently, a hallmark of Trudeau\u2019s tenure as prime minister. Like Barack Obama, Trudeau seemed to understand better than other politicians how to adapt the old ideas of political marketeering to the new realities of social media. He was a master of the viral video clip or poignant photo that seemed to express the worthiness of his government and the virtue of his politics. He became, as a flurry of academic research has put it, the first prime minister of the Instagram age. \u201cI think he\u2019s probably the best national leader since Ronald Reagan at projecting a certain image,\u201d says Warren Kinsella, a former Liberal strategist. Trudeau has championed a vision of Canada as a nation friendly to allies, open to immigrants and just to its people. According to this image, Canada is a paragon of progressivism in an era marked by strains of authoritarian populism \u2013 as if crossing the border that separates Canada from Donald Trump\u2019s US means travelling through a political looking-glass. And yet, Trudeau was never exactly anti-populist: he cultivated an impression that he both serves the masses and is adored by them. Ironically, but perhaps inevitably, Trudeau\u2019s efforts to depict himself in this way have now helped to set the stage for his potential unmaking. Some of the policies enacted by Trudeau\u2019s government have made his political identity seem hollow, even disingenuous. Compounding this has been the ongoing fallout from the most significant controversy of his tenure: Canada\u2019s ethics watchdog recently found that Trudeau broke the country\u2019s conflict of interest law in the hopes of allowing a giant engineering and construction firm to avoid a corruption trial. The company is facing charges in connection with millions of dollars in bribes allegedly paid to officials in Libya, including members of the Gaddafi regime, between 2001 and 2011. Far from the progressive, transparent government that Trudeau sold to Canadians and the global media, the scandal suggests that, like previous Canadian governments, Trudeau\u2019s administration remains in thrall to the \u201cLaurentian consensus\u201d \u2013 the web of political, business and intellectual elites in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal whose collective name is a nod to eastern Canada\u2019s mighty St Lawrence river. Ahead of a federal election in October, Trudeau\u2019s approval ratings have plunged from a high of 65% in 2016 to about 32% in July, leaving him vulnerable to becoming the first Canadian prime minister since the 1930s to lose a bid for re-election after winning only one majority mandate. \u201cBrand Trudeau was squeaky clean and fresh and new and a different kind of politics,\u201d says Shachi Kurl, a pollster from the Angus Reid Institute. \u201cAnd it\u2019s turned out that Brand Trudeau is: \u2018Welcome to the new politics, just like the old politics.\u2019\u201d * * * In an age of constant and intimate exposure to celebrities, it may seem unsurprising that the head of government of a country containing less than half of 1% of the world\u2019s population should be so familiar. But how many other Canadian prime ministers have been profiled in the New York Times Magazine, Vogue and Rolling Stone? How many other Canadian prime ministers can most non-Canadians even name, let alone call to mind an image of? One of the extraordinary things about Trudeau is that he is famous in part because he is Canadian \u2013 a remarkably rare kind of fame. Most Canadians who are famous outside of the country have been processed through Hollywood or the US-dominated recording industry. Part of Trudeau\u2019s appeal within Canada, then, is that he assuaged a dual sense of cultural insecurity and superiority, especially with regard to the country\u2019s belligerent southern neighbour. (The majority of Canadians see Trudeau\u2019s fame as a net benefit to the country, according to the Angus Reid Institute.) On the global stage he presented a sort of ideal form \u2013 likable, handsome, virtuous \u2013 in which the country could see its best self. Trudeau\u2019s distinctly Canadian appeal goes even deeper. The prime minister represents a potent idea of Canada and what it means to the world. This idea is perhaps best summed up by a campaign motto of Trudeau\u2019s father, from the late 1960s: \u201cThe just society.\u201d The idea was sold to Canadians as encompassing the protection of civil rights, economic opportunity for all, scientific remedies to environmental problems, greater autonomy for Indigenous people in Canada, and a country in which the language rights of both French and English were enshrined. A great deal of Trudeau\u2019s political cachet within Canada has been inherited from his father. Pierre is a towering figure in Canadian history, who liberalised laws on abortion and homosexuality, entrenched a charter of universal rights and instituted official bilingualism. The Canadian mass media guru Marshall McLuhan, a friendly adviser to Pierre throughout the 15 years he was prime minister, believed that Canada had no fixed identity, giving Pierre an opportunity to act as its \u201cunifying image\u201d. Canada could, in a sense, become what Pierre made it. Even if few Canadians subscribe to McLuhan\u2019s view, it captures something central to how Pierre framed his own tenure as prime minister. The craze for Justin Trudeau during the first years of his prime ministership echoed the \u201cTrudeaumania\u201d of his father\u2019s ascent to power. Pierre, too, captured attention around the world by staging moments of spectacle \u2013 whether it was sliding down a bannister during his 1968 campaign for Liberal leader or pirouetting behind the Queen at Buckingham Palace in 1977. Pierre was \u201cpackaged and presented as a debonair anti-politician who drove sports cars and spent time with pretty women\u201d, writes Alex Marland, a scholar of Canadian political branding at Memorial University. \u201cTo cultivate an image of a pop culture phenomenon\u201d during Canada\u2019s 1968 federal election, he adds, \u201cLiberal strategists recruited young Liberal women to behave as obsessed fanatics\u201d when Pierre was in the presence of reporters. Justin\u2019s attempts to recreate Trudeaumania have involved wading through crowds to allow fans to snap selfies with him \u2013 while his official photographer captures the moment at a slight distance. The results, posted on Instagram, feel like a record of spontaneous adulation, but are actually tightly controlled. As Marland puts it, Trudeau is executing a \u201csimilar playbook\u201d to his father\u2019s, but \u201cin different technological terrain\u201d. Outside the country, Trudeau has played to the world\u2019s eagerness to imagine Canada as a northern utopia untouched by the forces of nationalism and xenophobia. Within the country, however, there are many who think that Liberal Canada has never been the progressive place that Pierre and Justin tried to make it seem. The question now is whether voters believe his son has delivered more than just a good narrative. * * * When a political brand becomes as powerful as Trudeau\u2019s has, it is tempting to read a person\u2019s entire biography as a branding exercise. Things the politician did in their life before politics become plot points in a success story devised by a canny political operator. Ian Capstick, a political commentator who has worked for the Liberals as well as their rivals to the left, the New Democratic party, believes that Trudeau and his longtime friend and adviser Gerald Butts \u201chave been carefully calculating every single entree of Mr Trudeau into Canadian public life for the past 30 years\u201d. He adds: \u201cThere is not a single action that he took publicly that wasn\u2019t considered, reconsidered and put out there in an attempt to eventually build the base that he would require to be prime minister.\u201d Even if this view is a little too cynical, there is no doubt that living his entire life in the public eye has endowed Trudeau with an instinctive, if not infallible, sense of political optics. The beginning of his rise to power has usually been dated to 3 October 2000, when the 28-year-old delivered a dramatic televised eulogy at his father\u2019s state funeral, closing with the words \u201cJe t\u2019aime, papa\u201d, before resting his head on his father\u2019s flag-draped coffin, his tears falling freely. Switchboards at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation lit up with more than 1,000 requests to replay the tribute. Immediately, there was talk of the younger Trudeau entering politics, but many observers felt he lacked gravitas. He had spent his mid-20s drifting between stints as a bar bouncer and snowboard instructor before becoming a schoolteacher. He even admitted, or pretended, to an ignorance of current affairs. \u201cI don\u2019t read the newspapers, I don\u2019t watch the news,\u201d he wrote in the Globe and Mail the year after his father\u2019s death. \u201cI figure, if something important happens, someone will tell me.\u201d Trudeau finally entered politics in 2007, when he began running for parliament in the riding of Papineau, a multicultural district in Montreal, which was represented at the time by a Quebec-nationalist party. During the election in 2008, he grasped something in miniature that Obama demonstrated on a larger scale that same year: that a political brand is not sufficient in and of itself \u2013 you also need a political operation. (Trump, who may not have had much of a grassroots campaign by comparison, is proof of how far such operations have moved to social media.) Trudeau won after mounting a year-long effort to knock on doors and shake hands in the district. It was an impressive start, but Trudeau\u2019s subsequent four years as an MP were generally seen as insipid. It wasn\u2019t until his rout of the Conservative senator Brazeau in the boxing match in 2012 that the larger political tide began to turn for him. Three years later, Trudeau\u2019s fight to become prime minister made his father\u2019s brand his own. In the 2015 general election, Trudeau married the values of the just society with the electoral approach pioneered by Obama, building the infrastructure for a grassroots effort while mounting an aggressive social media campaign. But Trudeau relied more heavily than Obama could on images. \u201cObama\u2019s use of social media was, for lack of a better term, pre-visual,\u201d says Tamara Small, a political science professor at Ontario\u2019s University of Guelph. The election pitted Trudeau against Stephen Harper, a dour Conservative who had governed Canada for nearly a decade. Few expected much of Trudeau, the neophyte leader of Canada\u2019s third-ranked party. \u201cI think that if he comes on stage with his pants on, he will probably exceed expectations,\u201d a Conservative spokesperson told reporters before the first debate. In one famous attack advert, Conservatives labelled Trudeau as \u201cjust not ready\u201d, while mockingly conceding that he has \u201cnice hair, though\u201d. But many Canadians already felt a deep connection to Trudeau. \u201cHe has grown up in the public eye. He was literally born while his father was prime minister,\u201d Marland told me. \u201cHe was a celebrity before he even became prime minister.\u201d This made Trudeau seem regal, yet familiar \u2013 a brand you knew and could trust. Trudeau\u2019s team did everything they could to encourage this intimate connection with their candidate. \u201cIt was probably Canada\u2019s first celebrity politics federal election,\u201d says Huguette Young, a veteran Ottawa journalist and author of Justin Trudeau: The Natural Heir. \u201cThey had Dinner with Justin, just like Dinner with Obama, and contests and you could win a date with Justin. He was almost commodified as a product.\u201d \u201cTrudeau really built his brand in order to counter the brand of Harper,\u201d says Vincent Raynauld, a professor at Boston\u2019s Emerson College who studies Canadian politics. In contrast to his opponent, who was seen as icy and remote, Trudeau promised a return to \u201csunny ways\u201d \u2013 the motto of a much-admired prime minister from the turn of the 20th century. While Harper mooted banning the niqab at Canadian citizenship ceremonies and launching a hotline to ferret out what his party called \u201cbarbaric cultural practices\u201d, Trudeau made a passionate defence of multiculturalism and immigration. These were only two of the areas in which Trudeau promised to \u201cdo politics differently\u201d. In a country where women make up just 26% of MPs, he promised to usher in a new age of gender equality \u2013 beginning by naming a cabinet comprised of as many women as men. In what would have constituted a direct challenge to his own party\u2019s dominance, Trudeau pledged to make space for smaller political parties by reforming Canada\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system. He vowed to reset the country\u2019s relationship with its disproportionately disadvantaged Indigenous peoples. All in all, the Liberal manifesto made 353 specific policy promises. After almost a decade of Harper, there was a widespread desire for change. Presented with two very different images of Canada\u2019s future, voters responded with a clear answer. On 19 October 2015, the Liberal party swept back to power by picking up 148 seats on top of the 36 they already held in Canada\u2019s 338-member parliament. It was the largest increase in seats in Canadian history. * * * As Trudeau took office, his focus on optics was on full display. The often sedate swearing-in of a new government was thrown open to the public and turned into a highly stage-managed, live-streamed event. Trudeau was due to arrive by coach at the prime minister\u2019s official residence, 24 Sussex Drive, where he spent his childhood. (The house has been under renovation since Trudeau took office, and he and his family have been living in a 22-room guest house nearby.) To avoid any inelegant photos or video \u2013 \u201cGetting off a bus is such an ugly shot,\u201d Trudeau told his communications director that morning, in comments captured by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation \u2013 Trudeau\u2019s team misled the media about where they should meet the new prime minister, ensuring that the first images the press got were of him strolling from 24 Sussex to the governor general\u2019s official residence, Rideau Hall, where the ceremony would take place. At another point that morning, Trudeau and his team were preparing to respond to the question of why he was appointing a gender-balanced cabinet. \u201cI think just calling people\u2019s attention to the year is all you really need to say,\u201d Gerald Butts, Trudeau\u2019s right-hand man, told him. The advice yielded one of Trudeau\u2019s most internationally famous lines: \u201cBecause it\u2019s 2015.\u201d Around the same time, Trudeau\u2019s team was courting international attention, prioritising interviews with the New York Times and a sultry photoshoot for Vogue with his wife, Sophie, over interviews with Canadian media. \u201cThat was very, very deliberate,\u201d said Susan Delacourt, a journalist at the Toronto Star. \u201cThere was a sense that Canadians would like that.\u201d Many Canadians initially did, interpreting the attention as a sign of Trudeau\u2019s place among progressive world leaders at a time when Obama was still president and Hillary Clinton seemed poised to succeed him, Delacourt added. Trudeau moved his official photographer into an office two doors down from his own. A mix of intimate and public photo ops \u2013 of the prime minister cuddling with pandas, greeting Syrian refugees as they landed on Canadian soil, throwing punches in a Brooklyn boxing gym \u2013 transformed Trudeau from a politician into a series of memes. During his first year in power, barely a week went by without some sort of viral moment from the prime minister that found its way into people\u2019s daily lives as they scrolled through Snapchat on the bus or perused Instagram in bed. As Trudeau content appeared on social media shorn of context, it created new realities: a rehearsed explanation of quantum computing became a show of Trudeau\u2019s intellectual prowess; an innocuous cough on a visit to Washington DC became an example of Trudeau trolling the president. A vital part of Trudeau\u2019s brand was the contrast between him and the far-right politicians gaining ground around the world. In the US, Trump was on a journey that in some ways echoed Trudeau\u2019s, parlaying his celebrity status into political power. When it came to optics, though, \u201cTrump was a gift\u201d for Trudeau, says Philippe Garneau, a corporate branding executive whose brother Marc ran against Trudeau for the Liberal leadership and is a minister in Trudeau\u2019s cabinet. \u201cI remember being worried. I said: \u2018How can we put a man who has a degree in teaching and [who taught] drama, sit him down with Angela Merkel and across from Putin?\u2019 And in walks Potus and upsets the whole apple cart,\u201d Garneau went on. \u201cSo Trudeau got lucky. He was never shown to be the youngest, newest, greenest member at the table, but rather some sort of version of youthful exuberance, enthusiasm, optimism and a lack of cynicism.\u201d When Trump pushed through his ban on travellers from a number of Muslim-majority countries, Trudeau tweeted that Canada would welcome those fleeing persecution, regardless of their faith. As accusations of sexual misconduct piled up against Trump, Trudeau proclaimed his own feminism in the pages of Marie Claire. As Trump vowed to put America first, Trudeau said Canada was \u201cback\u201d as a global player. Trudeau\u2019s contrast with Trump was successfully memefied when the two leaders met in February 2017. Trump\u2019s opening salvo with other world leaders had been an uncomfortably long, domineering handshake. Days earlier, Shinz\u014d Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, had been left reeling after a grip that dragged on for 19 seconds. Trudeau agonised for weeks about finding a technique that could show he was capable of holding his own, but which wouldn\u2019t antagonise the man now at the helm of Canada\u2019s largest trading partner. Eventually, he and his team decided on a combination handshake and shoulder grab. According to Politico, Trudeau and his senior aides spent part of their flight to Washington DC practising it. The rehearsal paid off: Trudeau was hailed around the world for the handshake he unleashed on Trump. Viral videos of the seconds-long power struggle overshadowed a visit in which Trudeau stood by silently \u2013 later telling reporters that it was not his place to lecture another country \u2013 as Trump unapologetically defended his controversial travel ban. It was part of a pattern in which Trudeau and his team produced globally viral images that starved important political issues of oxygen. In 2017, at the height of an opioid epidemic that had claimed a record number of overdose victims in Vancouver, Trudeau\u2019s official photographer took an opportunistic photo of the prime minister running past a crowd of high schoolers on their prom night. Criticisms that the Trudeau government had not done enough to address the opioid crisis were buried by viral photos of the prime minister in running shorts and a T-shirt surrounded by students in suits and floor-length gowns. In politics, however, reality has a way of catching up with you. Eventually, the scandal, instead of the photo op, is what goes viral. * * * In retrospect, it seems predictable that a brand so well-devised, so symbolic and emotive, would encourage idealisations that in reality no politician could match. In 2018, some three years after Trudeau took power, cracks began showing in Trudeau\u2019s glossy veneer. In February, Trudeau and his family made an eight-day visit to India that was described to me by his former foreign policy adviser, Roland Paris, as perhaps \u201cthe worst trip that a Canadian prime minister has ever taken abroad\u201d. Although Trudeau sat down with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, and attended a handful of other bilateral meetings, what gained traction on social media were photos of the prime minister flouncing around in traditional Indian outfits. The result was a trip that seemed heavy on Bhangra moves but light on official business. \u201cIndia crystallised a lot of misgivings that liberals had that he was perhaps not as mature as we would like, he was not as prime ministerial as we would like, he was a little gimmicky and not taking it seriously with the world\u2019s largest democracy,\u201d Warren Kinsella, the former Liberal strategist, told me. Months later, Trudeau\u2019s feminist credentials took a hit after an allegation resurfaced that he had groped a reporter at an event in 2000. While acknowledging that he did apologise at the time to the reporter after she confronted him, Trudeau has said he is confident that he did not act inappropriately. Criticism grew that Trudeau\u2019s government was merely tinkering around the edges of change, masking their political inaction with a steady diet of unexpected moments and big talk. \u201cWe\u2019ve done check box, check box, check box,\u201d says Celina Caesar-Chavannes, an MP and former parliamentary secretary to the prime minister who resigned from the Liberal caucus after a dispute with Trudeau. \u201cBut how does it really transform the lives of people who don\u2019t have Trudeau\u2019s privilege, who don\u2019t have my privilege?\u201d Caesar-Chavannes argues that Trudeau\u2019s government has made small changes but consistently shies away from the bold, transformational work he promised in a campaign built around the slogan, \u201cReal Change\u201d. \u201cI think there were some decisions around our ability to be re-elected as opposed to doing politics differently,\u201d she says. Caesar-Chavannes gave me a number of examples of this sort of policymaking. Trudeau\u2019s government legalised marijuana but rebuffed a call to expunge the records of those convicted of simple possession, even though prosecutions had disproportionately targeted people with low-incomes and Canadians of colour. Trudeau appointed a gender-balanced cabinet, but refused to reform the country\u2019s electoral system, which would have paved the way for more female lawmakers. He promised a \u201ctotal renewal\u201d of Canada\u2019s relationship with Indigenous communities, but his government has done little to address the mould-ridden housing and lack of clean drinking water that has left many Indigenous communities living in \u201cHaiti at -40C\u201d, as a politician from the New Democratic party has put it. After vowing to prioritise the fight against climate change and criticising Saudi Arabia\u2019s treatment of human rights advocates, Trudeau\u2019s government bought a C$4.5bn (\u00a32.8bn) pipeline to better transport Alberta\u2019s landlocked bitumen to international markets and signed off on the sale of more than 900 armoured vehicles to Riyadh. And, after much of the international hype over its welcoming stance on refugees had died down, the government quietly introduced legislation this April that makes it harder for some migrants to seek asylum. Despite Trudeau selling himself as an open and transparent leader, several sources within the government described the centralisation of power in his office, with the prime minister\u2019s inner circle playing the role of his gatekeepers. This is typical of highly branded politicians \u2013 the pressure to keep the whole government on message encourages top-down control \u2013 but Trudeau may have taken it to an extreme. St\u00e9phane Dion served as Trudeau\u2019s foreign minister for 14 months, and during that time he didn\u2019t manage to land a single one-on-one meeting with the prime minister despite multiple requests, says Jocelyn Coulon, a former senior policy advisor to Dion. (Dion declined my request for a comment.) Trudeau\u2019s supporters point to the ways in which he has lived up to his promises. Since 2015, more than 44,000 Syrian refugees have been settled in Canada, compared with the 2,300 that Stephen Harper\u2019s government took in between 2013 and 2015. Trudeau\u2019s tenure so far has seen 278,000 children lifted out of poverty, a feat credited to the country\u2019s buoyant economy as well as a marquee child-benefit programme that provides direct funds to the country\u2019s poorest families. The government raised taxes on the top 1%, while cutting income tax for those in the middle bracket. And, while Canada is expected to fall short of its target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030, Trudeau and his government have taken fledgling steps towards tackling climate change with legislation mandating a price on carbon in every province. Perhaps Trudeau\u2019s shortcomings wouldn\u2019t have dominated public discussion in Canada for much of this year if a single large scandal hadn\u2019t focused Canadians on the gap between Trudeau the brand and his actions while in government. In February, Trudeau was accused of trying to bully his justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, into helping SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec-based engineering and construction company, avoid a corruption trial. Wilson-Raybould testified to a parliamentary committee earlier this year that Trudeau and his staff were worried that, if prosecuted, the company would move its head offices out of Montreal, potentially killing thousands of jobs and alienating voters in Quebec, home to a large number of strategically important parliamentary seats. Alongside the suggestion that Trudeau wanted to put his electoral success ahead of the integrity of the legal process, there was another layer to the scandal. Wilson-Raybould herself had once been a potent symbol of the Trudeau brand: she was the first Indigenous person and only the third woman to hold the post of justice minister. But the way she had been pressured by Trudeau and his team included \u201cundeniable elements of misogyny\u201d, she told the committee. Earlier this month, Canada\u2019s ethics commissioner concluded Trudeau had violated the country\u2019s ethics rules when he used his office to \u201ccircumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit\u201d Wilson-Raybould. * * * When Canadians head to the polls in October, a central question will be whether Trudeau\u2019s image is so badly tarnished that the Liberal party\u2019s vision of Canada will seem less appealing, and less realistic, than the vision on offer by the parties to its right and left. As things stand, Trudeau\u2019s main opponent is the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer. Scheer has vowed to roll back carbon taxes, opposed UN efforts to promote global cooperation on migration and wants to move Canada\u2019s embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He has also appointed a former board member of Rebel Media, a far-right website that has been described as Breitbart North, as his campaign manager. In order to hang on to votes in the diverse suburbs that ring Toronto, which have proven decisive in recent elections, Liberals have been highlighting Scheer\u2019s divisiveness on issues of race and immigration. Trudeau has also drawn attention to the Conservative party\u2019s poor record on the climate crisis, and there are signs that he will continue using Trump\u2019s presidency to reinforce his own image as a champion of the just society. His government recently struck a deal with California to reduce vehicle emissions, while Trudeau has vocally criticised new restrictions on abortion access in a number of Republican-controlled US states. The prime minister is also trying to repair the damage done to his reputation by the SNC-Lavalin scandal, and by the fact that he subsequently forced Wilson-Raybould and another cabinet minister, Jane Philpott, out of the Liberal caucus. \u201cWe worked really hard to try and see if there wasn\u2019t a way of continuing to move forward together,\u201d Trudeau told the audience at a Liberal fundraiser in June. \u201cThat\u2019s completely incompatible with facts,\u201d Philpott told me. \u201cBetween 4 March when I resigned from cabinet and 2 April when I was booted out of caucus, I didn\u2019t have a single conversation with the prime minister. And I had only one phone call from someone in his office.\u201d She added: \u201cThere are times where the image and the narrative that the prime minister\u2019s office wants to put out there is more important than accuracy.\u201d Philpott likened this to another element of Trudeau\u2019s brand that had rung false to her as a former cabinet member: \u201cThe whole listening to women, \u2018diversity is our strength\u2019, that kind of image,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yet I didn\u2019t feel listened to, and my diverse views didn\u2019t feel like they had a place \u2013 those kinds of things were disappointing.\u201d Philpott is planning on running as an independent in the October election, and said she now had a \u201clovely freedom\u201d from the message control that had coloured all aspects of her job as a Liberal MP. Those behind Trudeau roundly reject the idea of the prime minister as a highly managed brand. \u201cAt the end of the day, he\u2019s not a Nike sneaker,\u201d says Kate Purchase, his executive director of communications and planning, whose responsibilities include vetting posts for his social media accounts. \u201cHe is a leader.\u201d Purchase pointed to the issues Trudeau addresses, from the anxiety of the middle class to diversity and inclusion, to explain his meteoric rise on the world stage. \u201cThose are things that many governments are struggling with,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will always describe what they believe the brand to be, and what their version of the brand is, but at the end of the day, I think our brand is what we\u2019ve delivered.\u201d In recent weeks, polls suggest the Liberals have halted their plunge, and are slowly regaining some support. Still, an extraordinary challenge lies head for Trudeau and his team as they head into the October election, says the pollster Shachi Kurl. \u201cHow do you course-correct from something that is less about an event or a policy that people disagree with, and more about a broken brand?\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

But as a white man with a media platform, what happened to me garnered far more interest than the racist murders or serious hate crimes that have far worse consequences than bumped heads and bruises. The far right is emboldened, legitimised and ever more violent, and hate crimes are surging.

The far right has always had two principal enemies \u2013 minorities and the political left \u2013 and nothing has changed. Eight years ago, the Norwegian far-right terrorist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/23/utoya-mass-murder-anders-behring-breivik\" title=\"\">Anders Breivik</a> slaughtered dozens of predominantly young socialists on the island of Ut\u00f8ya. His reason? The left\u2019s anti-racism meant they were the driving force behind what he described as the \u201cIslamisation\u201d and therefore destruction of Christian Europe. This was a particularly violent expression of a persistent far-right conspiracy theory and, while leftwing teenagers died on that Norwegian island, this narrative did not. Members of the left are, according to this mindset, traitors to their nation, seeking to destroy it through mass immigration of culturally hostile aliens, and are allies of a despised enemy \u2013 Islam as a demonised religion, Muslims as a people.</p> \n<p>Far-right terrorists feed off the hatred that is often fanned by elites when it suits them. The recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/04/mass-shootings-el-paso-texas-dayton-ohio\" title=\"\">El Paso terrorist attack</a>, in which Latin American people were slaughtered, cannot be divorced from the systematic demonisation of Mexican immigrants by rightwing media outlets and Republican politicians, and now in an undiluted form by a US president who labels them rapists and criminals. Jews \u2013 who have been targeted for 2,000 years \u2013 were butchered and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/28/pittsburgh-shooting-jewish-organisations-express-horror-at-attack-victims\" title=\"\">maimed in Pittsburgh</a> less than year ago. The alleged terrorist reportedly accused Jews of trying to bring \u201cevil\u201d Muslims to the United States \u2013 here was an ancient hatred married to a more modern manifestation: Jews as disloyal and rootless, seeking to destroy western civilisation by importing dangerous Muslims.

      "bodyText": "Mohammed Saleem was murdered by a terrorist, and yet you\u2019ve probably never even heard of him. It was April 2013, and the 82-year-old was walking home from evening prayers at a mosque in Small Heath, Birmingham. A Ukrainian neo-Nazi terrorist \u2013 who had bombed three mosques \u2013 stabbed him three times from behind. \u201cHe was a very beautiful, educated man who empowered all of his five daughters \u2013 and his sons as well \u2013 to pursue education, and loved and appreciated everything Britain gave him,\u201d says Maz Saleem, his daughter. \u201cI\u2019ve spent six years tirelessly campaigning for him to be recognised in a mainstream platform.\u201d Three weeks later, the murder of Lee Rigby by Islamist fundamentalists sparked national outrage and an emergency Cobra meeting: not so for Saleem. \u201cIt was brushed under the mat,\u201d Maz tells me. Or what of Mushin Ahmed, an 81-year-old grandfather who was killed by two British racists in August 2015 as he walked to pray at a Rotherham mosque? As one of his assailants screamed that he was a \u201cgroomer\u201d, he was kicked with such force that his dentures shattered and the imprint of a trainer was left in his face. Or what of a 32-year-old black man in east London who, in June 2018, had to crawl on his knees to the A12 to escape a racist attack: he\u2019d been stabbed five times. I was on the receiving end of an attack in the early hours of last Saturday: my friends were punched defending me and I suffered very minor injuries. But as a white man with a media platform, what happened to me garnered far more interest than the racist murders or serious hate crimes that have far worse consequences than bumped heads and bruises. The far right is emboldened, legitimised and ever more violent, and hate crimes are surging. When we discuss Islamist fundamentalist terrorists, we ask: who are the hate preachers radicalising them in mosques or the internet? We have yet to engage seriously in a similar debate about far-right terrorism for a simple reason: the hate preachers are mainstream politicians, commentators and media outlets. Consider the scale of the threat. The far right has always had two principal enemies \u2013 minorities and the political left \u2013 and nothing has changed. Eight years ago, the Norwegian far-right terrorist Anders Breivik slaughtered dozens of predominantly young socialists on the island of Ut\u00f8ya. His reason? The left\u2019s anti-racism meant they were the driving force behind what he described as the \u201cIslamisation\u201d and therefore destruction of Christian Europe. This was a particularly violent expression of a persistent far-right conspiracy theory and, while leftwing teenagers died on that Norwegian island, this narrative did not. Members of the left are, according to this mindset, traitors to their nation, seeking to destroy it through mass immigration of culturally hostile aliens, and are allies of a despised enemy \u2013 Islam as a demonised religion, Muslims as a people. Far-right terrorists feed off the hatred that is often fanned by elites when it suits them. The recent El Paso terrorist attack, in which Latin American people were slaughtered, cannot be divorced from the systematic demonisation of Mexican immigrants by rightwing media outlets and Republican politicians, and now in an undiluted form by a US president who labels them rapists and criminals. Jews \u2013 who have been targeted for 2,000 years \u2013 were butchered and maimed in Pittsburgh less than year ago. The alleged terrorist reportedly accused Jews of trying to bring \u201cevil\u201d Muslims to the United States \u2013 here was an ancient hatred married to a more modern manifestation: Jews as disloyal and rootless, seeking to destroy western civilisation by importing dangerous Muslims. Chillingly, in overtly antisemitic remarks, Donald Trump this week accused Jewish Americans who vote for Democrats of \u201cgreat disloyalty\u201d. The 2015 far-right terrorist attack on a black church in Charleston cannot be understood in isolation from the fact that slavery, which has bequeathed an extensive racist legacy, was abolished just two lifetimes ago. In New Zealand\u2019s Christchurch massacre, more than 50 Muslims \u2013 people with a faith that has been targeted not just by the far right but several mainstream media outlets and politicians \u2013 were murdered. In Britain, the Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered by a white far-right terrorist who gave his name in court as \u201cdeath to traitors, freedom for Britain\u201d. What lesson was learned? How was Nigel Farage able to brag that Brexit had been won \u201cwithout a single bullet being fired\u201d, and later declare he\u2019d \u201cdon khaki, pick up a rifle and head for the front lines\u201d if Brexit wasn\u2019t delivered, without his political or media career suffering? How did the far-right terrorist plot to murder Labour MP Rosie Cooper with a machete not lead to national shock and horror \u2013 and a determination to crush the political ideology behind it? What of the far-right attack on Muslim worshippers in Finsbury Park, whose perpetrator expressed a desire to murder Jeremy Corbyn and Sadiq Khan as terrorist supporters? The hate preachers radicalising far-right extremists are not ranting on soap boxes on street corners: they get splashed on front pages. They use rhetoric such as \u201cEnemies of the people\u201d and \u201cCrush the saboteurs\u201d; they deploy distortions, myths, half-truths and lies to whip up hatred against Muslims, migrants and refugees, and to scapegoat them for crimes committed by the powerful. In the clash between fascists and antifascists in Charlottesville, Trump infamously declared there \u201cwere very fine people on both sides\u201d, and in doing so founded \u201cboth-sideism\u201d: the idea that advocating white supremacy is morally equivalent to opposing racism and wanting rich people to pay higher taxes. Yet this moral equivalence \u2013 which includes claiming that the left is equally violent \u2013 is beyond dangerous. The far right might be committing murderous terrorist atrocities against minorities, but some guy poured a banana and salted caramel milkshake on Nigel Farage\u2019s favourite suit! Sure, there are members of minorities being murdered on the streets by racists with little media coverage, but the US neo-Nazi Richard Spencer was punched once, so who is to say who is worse? There is a systematic campaign to delegitimise the very few leftwing voices in the mainstream media and politics, orchestrated not just by the right, but by some self-described \u201cmoderates\u201d and \u201ccentrists\u201d too. The attempt to construct a false equivalence between a far right that is on a murderous rampage against minorities and their allies, and a left committed to resisting its hatred and violence, is perverse. Mainstream politicians and several media outlets are legitimising ideas that fuel ideologically driven far-right terrorism and violent racist and bigoted attacks. Many more will be injured, and will die, as a consequence, and because they are not white, and because they lack a national platform, you will probably never hear their names. \u2022Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",
