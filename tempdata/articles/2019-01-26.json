      "bodyText": "Hundreds of people are feared dead after a dam operated by the mining company Vale collapsed in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, releasing a wave of red iron ore waste and causing the worst environmental catastrophe in the country\u2019s recent history. Authorities say that 40 people have died, and more than 300 people remain missing according to the company. The disaster comes only three years after a similar failure of the Fund\u00e3o tailings dam near Mariana \u2013 co-owned by Vale \u2013 which killed 19 people. Speaking after the latest disaster, the local fire chief Col Edgar Estev\u00e3o said 100 people had been rescued from the sea of mud released by the dam. However, Vale later released a list of 412 employees and contractors whom it had still been unable to contact, and the state governor, Romeu Zema, said he did not expect many more survivors. \u201cWe know now that the chances of having survivors are minimal and that we will probably rescue bodies,\u201d he said. Brazilian television showed images of survivors being winched to safety by a helicopter after the disaster at the Feij\u00e3o mine near Brumadinho, less than two hours from the state capital, Belo Horizonte. \u201cI saw a gigantic cloud of dust and a wave of mud. It was one wave on top of another,\u201d one contractor, Mayke Ferreira, told the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper. Ferreira said he had been sleeping in a nearby dormitory when he was woken by an enormous crash. It is not yet clear what caused the tailings dam to burst. However, the Brazilian environmental agency Ibama has already slapped a 250m reais (\u00a350m) fine on Vale for violations related to the tragedy. The company has caused pollution, made the area unfit for habitation and committed other regulatory violations, Ibama said. State prosecutors have also filed a request to freeze 5bn reais in Vale\u2019s accounts to help fund recovery works. Brazil\u2019s new president, Jair Bolsonaro, visited Minas Gerais and flew over the disaster area. \u201cWe will do what is within our reach to attend the victims, minimise damages, investigate the facts, demand justice and prevent new tragedies like Mariana and Brumadinho,\u201d he tweeted. But locals and environmentalist had argued that the tailings dam at the Corrego de Feij\u00e3o iron ore mining complex near Brumadinho presented risks as Vale sought licensing to continue and expand operations at this and another nearby mine. Bolsonaro has attacked the \u201cfines industry\u201d of environmental agencies such as Ibama for holding up development. \u201cThis tragedy was only a matter of time,\u201d said Carlos Eduardo Pinto, a prosecutor who worked on the Mariana case. \u201cSince the Fund\u00e3o tailings dam, nothing has been done to increase control of this activity.\u201d Most of the victims of the disaster were Vale employees or subcontractors, around 100 of whom were having lunch in a canteen on the mine complex when the torrent of mud swept over them. A busload of workers was also killed, it was reported. Maicon Vitor, 22, an electro-mechanic technician, told O Globo newspaper that he had just left the canteen when he heard the roar of the tailings dam breaking. \u201cIt came down dragging workshops, offices; the whole canteen which was in front of me went,\u201d he said. Fabio Schvartsman, the chief executive of Vale, said he was devastated by the tragedy. \u201cMost of those affected were Vale employees,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m completely torn apart by what happened.\u201d Vale said the 86-metre-high tailings dam at the Corrego de Feij\u00e3o open-cast, iron ore mining complex was built in 1976 and held 11.7m litres of mining waste. It was being decommissioned and had been pronounced safe in inspections. But the National Civil Society Forum for Hydrographic Basins, a network of civil society groups, said that it had urged the authorities not to grant Vale a licence to continue operations there. \u201cThe population of Casa Branca is very worried, with good reason,\u201d Julio Grillo from Ibama, told a meeting on 11 December, according to minutes obtained by the Observer. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an official at the state environment agency asked why the company had built a canteen at the foot of the dam. \u201cHow can you approve a dam like this with the guy building an administrative centre with canteen at the foot of the tailings dam?\u201d It cost billions to clean up after the Mariana disaster in 2015, which polluted the drinking water of hundreds of thousands. Yet no individual was ever held responsible. \u201cCases like these are not accidents but environmental crimes,\u201d Greenpeace Brazil said in a statement. \u201cI hope now they will create a new way to mine that doesn\u2019t mount up waste, a safe way of working that does not leave widows,\u201d said Sandra Quintao, a survivor of the Mariana disaster. The Mariana dam was operated by Samarco, a joint venture between Vale and BHP Billiton, an Anglo-Australian mining giant.",

We\u2019re tired of seeing children eating in the rubbish,\u201d said Luis Torres, 34, an unemployed father-of-two from Petare, a sprawling shanty in the city\u2019s east.</p> <p>But as your correspondent moved around Caracas on Friday, unease and frustration could be seen, and deep trepidation over what is now a profoundly uncertain future.</p> <p>\u201cI want a change \u2013 but not through a coup or an intervention,\u201d said Naikary Agresot, 17, a student from Gramoven, a working-class and heavily pro-Ch\u00e1vez community in west Caracas. \u201cI wish Maduro could understand that things have gotten out of control and make room for someone who truly can change the country,\u201d added Agresot, who said she often lacked the money to take the bus to school or buy food.</p> <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s had his chance and he didn\u2019t know how to take advantage of it,\u201d she said of Maduro, who was first elected after Ch\u00e1vez died in 2013 and re-elected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/20/venezuela-president-nicolas-maduro-election\" title=\"\">last May in elections widely denounced as a farce</a>. \u201cIt isn\u2019t fair that someone works for a whole month and has to spend half their salary on a kilo of rice or meat.\u201d</p> <p>Torres was among those who took to the streets last week to support Guaid\u00f3 and said there were thousands of other slum-dwellers who also wanted Maduro gone. \u201cHere the prices are like in Switzerland, but you earn like you\u2019re in Haiti,\u201d he said.</p> <p>However, while he was desperate for \u201cfreedom\u201d Torres was alarmed at the prospect of a foreign military intervention to oust Maduro and hoped a peaceful way out could be found. The US has warned that \u201call options are on the table\u201d if Maduro responds to Guaid\u00f3\u2019s challenge with violence, while Maduro ordered his troops to prepare to defeat \u201cany imperialist enemy who dares touch our soil\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf there\u2019s no food now, just imagine what it would be like in a war \u2026 we\u2019ve seen what happened in Syria and Libya and we do not want this,\u201d Torres said.</p> <p>Opposition to Maduro \u2013 who claims Guaid\u00f3\u2019s move is part of a US-sponsored \u201ccoup\u201d similar to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/21/usa.venezuela\" title=\"\">botched 2002 attempt to topple his mentor </a>\u2013 was everywhere. But there was support, too. \u201cI want to give him another chance,\u201d said Yenny Cumana, a 32-year-old housewife from 24 de Julio, a community in Petare that was rocked by protests last week.</p> <p>\u201cI want to believe and I want things to improve so the country goes back to being like it was.\u201d</p> <p>Addressing a sea of supporters in Plaza Bol\u00edvar de Chacao on Friday, Guaid\u00f3 rejected claims that he was involved in a coup and said his movement had identified \u201ca clear path\u201d out of Venezuela\u2019s current nightmare: Maduro\u2019s exit, the installation of a transitional government, and free and fair elections. On Saturday the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/26/european-leaders-ready-to-recognise-guaido-as-venezuelan-president\" title=\"\">leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Spain</a> gave Maduro an eight-day ultimatum to call a vote or they would back his challenger.</p> <p>But with Maduro refusing to budge and China and Russia backing his administration, Venezuela\u2019s fate is shrouded in uncertainty. Many see the potential for violence, civil war or even a catastrophic cold war-style clash between the US, China and Russia if a peaceful resolution is not found. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can predict what is going to happen,\u201d said Mois\u00e9s Na\u00edm, a Venezuelan scholar who was the country\u2019s trade minister during the 1990s.</p> <p>Na\u00edm, a vocal critic of Chavismo, said he was encouraged by recent developments, calling them the opposition\u2019s first bit of good news since Ch\u00e1vez launched his ill-fated Bolivarian revolution two decades ago. \u201cThere are reasons to celebrate. The opposition has done a wonderful job of acting in a coherent and coordinated way. The international community \u2026 has rallied in very significant ways. [Last week\u2019s] marches and demonstrations included everyone. It was no longer just the [wealthy] east of Caracas protesting. It was the barrios. Everyone was in the streets showing opposition to Maduro.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80167d92cd0b930031d66d507850d591e37f5f1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80167d92cd0b930031d66d507850d591e37f5f1a/0_252_6306_3785/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Government supporters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Government supporters hold a cutout of Venezuela\u2019s late president Hugo Chavez during a rally in La Guaira on 25 January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rodrigo Abd/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Na\u00edm was also troubled by the potential for bloodshed if different military factions started backing different leaders. \u201cI am worried about a country that can fragment under different chieftains and warlords and generals and narco-traffickers [and guerrilla groups] and \u2026 Venezuela becoming like a tapestry of different power centres.\u201d So great are the uncertainties it is unclear even where Guaid\u00f3 might seek to set up his parallel government if Maduro \u2013 who also has the backing of Venezuela\u2019s military top brass \u2013 hangs on. Na\u00edm said he could imagine a situation where Caracas was politically partitioned, with Maduro in the Miraflores presidential palace and Guaid\u00f3 having his headquarters in the leafy eastern district of Altamira. \u201cIt could be as granular as that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cVenezuela could evolve towards a Lebanon circa 1985 \u2026 [when] after the war it fragmented and each neighbourhood had its own militia with its own head and you needed permits to move across the neighbourhoods.\u201d</p> <p>Mej\u00edas, who had never attended a political rally before Friday\u2019s, said he hoped Venezuela\u2019s military would step in to broker a solution that would avoid a \u201cgringo\u201d intervention and a bloodbath. \u201cIf we are here and there\u2019s an invasion, they\u2019ll fill everyone with lead, whether you\u2019re a Chavista or from the opposition.\u201d</p> <p>As Venezuela lurches towards a new, unsettled future, Mej\u00edas hoped that better times were coming \u201cand we can go back to being what we were before\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t be pessimistic,\u201d he insisted as the crowds poured into the square to hear from a man some hope will prove Venezuela\u2019s saviour. \u201cWe must have faith.\u201d</p>",

We\u2019re tired of seeing children eating in the rubbish,\u201d said Luis Torres, 34, an unemployed father-of-two from Petare, a sprawling shanty in the city\u2019s east. But as your correspondent moved around Caracas on Friday, unease and frustration could be seen, and deep trepidation over what is now a profoundly uncertain future. \u201cI want a change \u2013 but not through a coup or an intervention,\u201d said Naikary Agresot, 17, a student from Gramoven, a working-class and heavily pro-Ch\u00e1vez community in west Caracas. \u201cI wish Maduro could understand that things have gotten out of control and make room for someone who truly can change the country,\u201d added Agresot, who said she often lacked the money to take the bus to school or buy food. \u201cI think he\u2019s had his chance and he didn\u2019t know how to take advantage of it,\u201d she said of Maduro, who was first elected after Ch\u00e1vez died in 2013 and re-elected last May in elections widely denounced as a farce. \u201cIt isn\u2019t fair that someone works for a whole month and has to spend half their salary on a kilo of rice or meat.\u201d Torres was among those who took to the streets last week to support Guaid\u00f3 and said there were thousands of other slum-dwellers who also wanted Maduro gone. \u201cHere the prices are like in Switzerland, but you earn like you\u2019re in Haiti,\u201d he said. However, while he was desperate for \u201cfreedom\u201d Torres was alarmed at the prospect of a foreign military intervention to oust Maduro and hoped a peaceful way out could be found. The US has warned that \u201call options are on the table\u201d if Maduro responds to Guaid\u00f3\u2019s challenge with violence, while Maduro ordered his troops to prepare to defeat \u201cany imperialist enemy who dares touch our soil\u201d. \u201cIf there\u2019s no food now, just imagine what it would be like in a war \u2026 we\u2019ve seen what happened in Syria and Libya and we do not want this,\u201d Torres said. Opposition to Maduro \u2013 who claims Guaid\u00f3\u2019s move is part of a US-sponsored \u201ccoup\u201d similar to the botched 2002 attempt to topple his mentor \u2013 was everywhere. But there was support, too. \u201cI want to give him another chance,\u201d said Yenny Cumana, a 32-year-old housewife from 24 de Julio, a community in Petare that was rocked by protests last week. \u201cI want to believe and I want things to improve so the country goes back to being like it was.\u201d Addressing a sea of supporters in Plaza Bol\u00edvar de Chacao on Friday, Guaid\u00f3 rejected claims that he was involved in a coup and said his movement had identified \u201ca clear path\u201d out of Venezuela\u2019s current nightmare: Maduro\u2019s exit, the installation of a transitional government, and free and fair elections. On Saturday the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Spain gave Maduro an eight-day ultimatum to call a vote or they would back his challenger. But with Maduro refusing to budge and China and Russia backing his administration, Venezuela\u2019s fate is shrouded in uncertainty. Many see the potential for violence, civil war or even a catastrophic cold war-style clash between the US, China and Russia if a peaceful resolution is not found. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can predict what is going to happen,\u201d said Mois\u00e9s Na\u00edm, a Venezuelan scholar who was the country\u2019s trade minister during the 1990s. Na\u00edm, a vocal critic of Chavismo, said he was encouraged by recent developments, calling them the opposition\u2019s first bit of good news since Ch\u00e1vez launched his ill-fated Bolivarian revolution two decades ago. \u201cThere are reasons to celebrate. The opposition has done a wonderful job of acting in a coherent and coordinated way. The international community \u2026 has rallied in very significant ways. [Last week\u2019s] marches and demonstrations included everyone. It was no longer just the [wealthy] east of Caracas protesting. It was the barrios. Everyone was in the streets showing opposition to Maduro.\u201d But Na\u00edm was also troubled by the potential for bloodshed if different military factions started backing different leaders. \u201cI am worried about a country that can fragment under different chieftains and warlords and generals and narco-traffickers [and guerrilla groups] and \u2026 Venezuela becoming like a tapestry of different power centres.\u201d So great are the uncertainties it is unclear even where Guaid\u00f3 might seek to set up his parallel government if Maduro \u2013 who also has the backing of Venezuela\u2019s military top brass \u2013 hangs on. Na\u00edm said he could imagine a situation where Caracas was politically partitioned, with Maduro in the Miraflores presidential palace and Guaid\u00f3 having his headquarters in the leafy eastern district of Altamira. \u201cIt could be as granular as that,\u201d he said. \u201cVenezuela could evolve towards a Lebanon circa 1985 \u2026 [when] after the war it fragmented and each neighbourhood had its own militia with its own head and you needed permits to move across the neighbourhoods.\u201d Mej\u00edas, who had never attended a political rally before Friday\u2019s, said he hoped Venezuela\u2019s military would step in to broker a solution that would avoid a \u201cgringo\u201d intervention and a bloodbath. \u201cIf we are here and there\u2019s an invasion, they\u2019ll fill everyone with lead, whether you\u2019re a Chavista or from the opposition.\u201d As Venezuela lurches towards a new, unsettled future, Mej\u00edas hoped that better times were coming \u201cand we can go back to being what we were before\u201d. \u201cWe can\u2019t be pessimistic,\u201d he insisted as the crowds poured into the square to hear from a man some hope will prove Venezuela\u2019s saviour. \u201cWe must have faith.\u201d",

Gamilaraay man and native title applicant for the Gomeroi people, Raymond Weatherall, has warned successive failures to protect sacred places on the development site in the Liverpool Plains in north-west NSW, could lead to direct conflict between the Gomeroi, the state government and the Chinese state-owned company Shenhua. He is one of the approximately 190 Gomeroi applying to the federal government for permanent protection of their sacred sites under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Heritage Protection Act (ATSIHP) with the support of the NSW Aboriginal Land Council. Just before Christmas last year, the NSW planning department approved Shenhua\u2019s request to change the consent conditions, allowing \u201cpre-construction works\u201d to start on the site, even though a mining lease has yet to be granted. The NSW \u201cmodification\u201d, signed off by a senior bureaucrat David Kitto under delegation from the minister, changed the usual definition of \u201ccommencement\u201d to allow pre-construction works to include \u201cgeotechnical drilling or excavation, minor clearing and minor access roads\u201d. While the proposal has received development consent from the NSW Coalition government and conditional approval from the then federal environment minister Greg Hunt, two crucial management plans on water and biodiversity are required under the \u201cwater trigger\u201d laws before the mine can go ahead. Prior to the NSW change, Shenhua could not start these pre-construction activities without meeting these conditions. Gomeroi applicants, including Weatherall, are concerned the latest change in process denied the local Indigenous people any rights to seek protection and \u201chave a voice\u201d. \u201cWe are effectively denied access and rights on lands and waters which are our custodial rights and lands we have never ceded, never sold and never gifted,\u201d he said. \u201cThe NSW government are very well aware of our ATSIHP application and protracted battle to protect and defend our sacred places yet these appear to be deliberately ignored and legislation and processes developed which in effect sidestep or excuse the government from taking protection action. \u201cThe systemic and successive failures will only lead to direct conflict between the Gomeroi and a foreign government-owned mining company Shenhua and the state government who claim to be elected for all people.\u201d But a spokesman for the NSW planning department said the conditions of consent require Shenhua to prepare a heritage management plan prior to the commencement of construction. \u201cThis plan must include a description of the measures that would be implemented to protect and manage Indigenous heritage items on the site,\u201d he said. \u201cConstruction of the mine may not commence until this plan has been approved by the [planning] secretary.\u201d After Hunt granted Shenhua conditional approval in 2015, the minister promised that he would go further than any other minister in history before giving the final approval to the Shenhua mine. The Gomeroi\u2019s 2015 application to Hunt sought both emergency and permanent declarations to protect a number of important areas, including Mount Watermark, two grinding grooves areas and a sacred men\u2019s site.

There has been two subsequent federal environment ministers, Josh Frydenberg and the current minister Melissa Price, but the Gomeroi applicants are still awaiting the outcome of a determination of the permanent protection application, based on a report by Phillips. Price said the Phillips report would not be released publicly due to culturally sensitive and legally privileged information, but would make the decisions \u201cas expeditiously as practicable\u201d. \u201cThe changes to the state approval do not affect the federal approval conditions as the requirements set out in these conditions are linked to project milestones rather than specific dates,\u201d Price said. \u201cConstruction of the mine cannot commence without my approval of this plan.\u201d Prior to the mine proposal, the Gomeroi had access to their sites via the former landowners, but since the proposal, they have only been allowed to access land wholly owned or leased by Shenhua while accompanied by Phillips and Watermark mine representatives. Gomeroi traditional custodians spokesperson Dolly Talbott and native title applicant for Gomeroi people, Steven Talbott, said while a 2017 visit with Phillips was appreciated, they had been largely denied access. \u201cWe simply do not understand how a state government or federal government can provide such levels of power and rights to a foreign company to the detriment of the First Peoples of this country when the high court ruled that Terra nullius was a lie and under the commonwealth\u2019s own legislation were found to be wrong,\u201d Dolly Talbott said. Farmer Susan Lyle of the Caroona Coal Action Group said building the mine on the Gomeroi sites was tantamount to building a housing development on Rookwood cemetery. \u201cI believe when the [then] federal environment minister Josh Frydenberg had knowledge of the burial sites, he should have stopped the development immediately,\u201d Lyle said. Shenhua has applied to extract 268m tonnes of coal from the Watermark open-cut mine 25km south-east of Gunnedah, surrounded by some of Australia\u2019s most productive agricultural land. Fierce opposition from sections of the farming and Indigenous communities began when the Chinese state-owned company was granted an exploration licence for $300m by disgraced former NSW Labor resources minister Ian Macdonald in 2008. Since then, the Berejiklian government bought back 51% of the licence from Shenhua and paid the company a refund of $262m in 2017. Lock the Gate Alliance lost an appeal to the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal to access the buyback documents because they involved confidential negotiations, even though it acknowledged there was \u201ca good deal of public interest\u201d in the decision which involved \u201csignificant sums of public money\u201d. A spokesman for Shenhua, Gerry McDonald, said the NSW modification was required to fix some dates in the development approval that were \u201cclearly meaningless\u201d and to clarify whether soil testing would trigger various obligations. He said the company remained fully committed to the mine going ahead. Of the Gomeroi, McDonald said the claim was yet to be determined and the claimants were a small group. \u201cThe reality is that the group making the claim are only a very small group where the majority of the local Indigenous Gomeroi people around the area do support the project primarily because they want to see job opportunities for their families,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cSecond, the soil testing will not destroy any of the areas or artefacts and have been specifically designed to avoid such areas and artefacts.\u201d Dolly Talbott said claims they represented a small group was part of the \u201cnormal shit\u201d the company did. She said under law, only one applicant was needed for an ATSIHP application and the Gomeroi application had 190 people, the support of the NSW Land Council and they represented 15,000 Gomeroi people. \u201cWhy are they trying to diminish our voice and being so racist and disrespectful?\u201d Talbott said. \u201cI\u2019ve just about had gutful. Even if the application is not successful, it\u2019s not over. It will only keep ramping up. If the government or Shenhua think we are going to roll over, they have another thing coming.\u201d",

The Palace manager dealt extensively with Pochettino when his England side trained at Tottenham\u2019s facilities, and the pair are still close.</p> <p>\u201cPeople should wise up to what football is today and stop talking about trophies,\u201d said Hodgson. \u201cThey should look at the fact he\u2019s taken over a Tottenham team who, really and truly, are having their longest spell as being considered title contenders, Champions League contenders, while bringing through loads and loads of homegrown players.

      "bodyText": "Jan Vertonghen has said it would be a \u201cbig shame\u201d if Tottenham\u2019s current generation of players do not win a trophy. Spurs travel to Crystal Palace on Sunday for a FA Cup fourth-round tie that has increased in significance following their Carabao Cup semi-final loss to Chelsea. The FA Cup is by some distance their most realistic means of ending a trophy drought that stretches back 11 years. \u201cIt\u2019s very important,\u201d said Vertonghen of the tournament. \u201cThis team deserves so much more, so many trophies. Over the last five years, we haven\u2019t had a lot of luck. We\u2019ve been so good. It would be a big shame if we don\u2019t reward ourselves. Everyone in the club deserves that reward.\u201d Mauricio Pochettino presumably agrees with the defender but the manager made clear before Tottenham\u2019s third-round victory over Tranmere that his focus is on other competitions. \u201cIf you don\u2019t finish how we have finished [in the league] in the last three seasons but win the FA Cup, I don\u2019t know if Daniel [Levy, the Spurs chairman] would have too much patience,\u201d he said. \u201cMy ambition is to win the Champions League or the Premier League. That\u2019s what puts you in a different level.\u201d Tottenham beat Palace 1-0 when the sides met at Selhurst Park in the Premier League two months ago but on that occasion Pochettino was able to call upon Harry Kane, Dele Alli and Son Heung-min, three players who are unavailable to him this time around. The Argentinian is likely to field a similar side to the one that started at Stamford Bridge on Thursday. That would mean a place for Eric Dier who, along with the substitute Lucas Moura, missed a penalty in the shootout. \u201cEric and Lucas are maybe a bit more disappointed than the rest but they showed so much responsibility,\u201d said Vertonghen. \u201cEric was the hero at the World Cup and [against Chelsea] he missed. Fair enough. Lucas the same thing.\u201d Meanwhile Roy Hodgson has dismissed those criticising Pochettino for a lack of trophies as \u201cnaive\u201d and praised his opposite number\u2019s impact over the past five years at Spurs. The Palace manager dealt extensively with Pochettino when his England side trained at Tottenham\u2019s facilities, and the pair are still close. \u201cPeople should wise up to what football is today and stop talking about trophies,\u201d said Hodgson. \u201cThey should look at the fact he\u2019s taken over a Tottenham team who, really and truly, are having their longest spell as being considered title contenders, Champions League contenders, while bringing through loads and loads of homegrown players. What\u2019s a trophy got to do with it? \u201cMauricio\u2019s good. Anyone who watches Tottenham would have to be an admirer of the way they play and the way they go about their business. The manager is an integral part in that. \u201cIf you\u2019re only going to call managers who have won a trophy any good, then basically you have four or five. When was the last time a Bayern Munich manager didn\u2019t win a trophy? When was the last time a Barcelona manager didn\u2019t win a trophy? How do you win a trophy ahead of Barcelona or Bayern Munich? Or Malm\u00f6 in \u201885 [with whom he won the Swedish league]? \u201cIf the be-all and end-all of your ability is whether you\u2019ve got a trophy to your name, I find that hard to understand. It\u2019s so naive in terms of what the job of being a football coach is all about. You are just dooming 97 to 98% of all the people working in football as failures because they may not have a chance of winning a trophy. What about the Rotherham manager? He might be doing a great job. Is he going to be a hopeless manager all his life because he never wins a trophy? I don\u2019t see it.\u201d",

The coordinated move by western powers to boost the opposition challenger Juan Guaid\u00f3 came as the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, addressed the United Nations security council in New York and not only said that it was now time for countries to \u201cpick a side\u201d on Venezuela after Washington recognised Guaid\u00f3 as the nation\u2019s head of state but also urged countries to disconnect financially from Maduro\u2019s government. Pompeo said: \u201cEither you stand with the forces of freedom, or you\u2019re in league with Maduro and his mayhem. Now it is time for every other nation to pick a side. No more delays, no more games.\u201d In heated back-and-forth exchanges at a UN security council meeting, the opposing camp led by Venezuela and Russia, which has invested heavily in Venezuela\u2019s oil industry, accused Washington of attempting a coup and lambasted Europeans\u2019 demand that elections be called within eight days. Guaid\u00f3, who took the helm of the national assembly on 5 January, proclaimed himself interim president on Wednesday. The US, Canada and a string of Latin American countries recognised the young leader in quick succession. And late on Saturday Guaid\u00f3 gained support from a key military official. Venezuela\u2019s defence attache to Washington, Col Jos\u00e9 Luis Silva, told Reuters that he had broken with the Maduro government and recognized Guaid\u00f3 as interim president. And Hunt tweeted that Britain would join a growing number of countries in backing 35-year-old Guaid\u00f3 as the country\u2019s rightful leader unless Maduro called a snap election. He said: \u201cAfter banning opposition candidates, ballot box stuffing and counting irregularities in a deeply flawed election it is clear Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is not the legitimate leader of Venezuela. \u201c@jguaido is the right person to take Venezuela forward. If there are not fresh &amp; fair elections announced within 8 days UK will recognise him as interim president to take forward the political process towards democracy. Time for a new start for the suffering ppl of Venezuela.\u201d The foreign secretary\u2019s comments came shortly before the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, also spoke out in favour of new elections in Venezuela, echoing similar comments from France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron; the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez. The interventions reinforced a clear split in the international community, where Maduro has continuing support from two key members of the UN security council, Moscow and Beijing. On Friday, a Labour spokesman called for a negotiated settlement and warned against British intervention. \u201cWe oppose outside interference in Venezuela, whether from the US or anywhere else,\u201d he said. \u201cThe future of Venezuela is a matter for Venezuelans.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn has strongly criticised foreign attempts to undermine Maduro. The bid for power by Guaid\u00f3, head of the country\u2019s national assembly, is the most direct challenge to Maduro\u2019s rule following years of protests at home and international efforts to isolate his regime which has presided over a growing humanitarian crisis fuelled by falling oil prices and government mismanagement. Maduro has vowed to defend his socialist rule and accused his opponent of working with the US to overthrow him and install a \u201cpuppet government\u201d. The president, who faced rare mass protests last week, still has the support of the military. Pompeo, who was expected to address a security council meeting last night that was also due to be attended by the Venezuelan foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, said he hoped the \u201cinternational community will disconnect their financial systems from the Maduro regime\u201d. Russia had objected to the council\u2019s focus on Venezuela, according to UN diplomats. The country\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, said US actions were an \u201cobvious call for a coup d\u2019etat\u201d which would threaten peace. The meeting came a day after Guaid\u00f3 vowed to remain on the streets until his country had secured a transitional government. \u201cThey can cut a flower, but they will never keep spring from coming,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 told supporters on Friday, alluding to a similar phrase from the Chilean poet, Pablo Neruda. Both sides attempted dialogue last year, but talks collapsed as Maduro called an early election that excluded the country\u2019s most popular opposition leaders. Analysts fear the standoff between the two men could set the scene for further violence after days of political turmoil. The office of the UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, has said it has called for an investigation after receiving credible reports that security forces, or members of pro-government armed groups, shot at least 20 people during protests on Tuesday and Wednesday. According to the Penal Forum human rights group, 369 people have been detained since Monday. On Wednesday, Maduro gave US diplomats 72 hours to leave the country, an order Washington said it would defy by keeping the embassy open, though it told non-essential staff to leave.",

After near-misses at New Meadow and the Riverside earlier, AFC Wimbledon, at the wrong end of League One, up against a Jeykll and Hyde West Ham United \u2013 a team dining at the top table \u2013 has the makings of a cup classic. This is AFC Wimbledon\u2019s first FA Cup fourth-round outing since their reformation in 2002 \u2013 though they have lost all their previous two FA Cup meetings with Premier League opposition (2014-15 v Liverpool and 2017-18 v Tottenham Hotspur). </p> <p>\u201cI think going head-to-head with a Premier League team you\u2019re going to come unstuck nine times out of 10,\u201d says manager Wally Downes. \u201cSo you can\u2019t go gung-ho.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for your company. A quick nugget of news: Marko Arnautovic has signed a new undisclosed-length contract at West Ham. \u201cI love this club and I will always love this club no matter what,\u201d the Austrian says. Hmmm. And time for a glance at the teams who have already sealed their spot in Monday\u2019s fifth-round draw: AFC Wimbledon, Millwall, Swansea, Bristol City, Manchester United, Watford, Manchester City, Doncaster, Derby. Do join us for the rest of this weekend\u2019s FA Cup action: FA Cup fixtures Crystal Palace v Tottenham, Sun 4pm (GMT) Chelsea v Sheffield Wednesday, Sun 6pm Barnet v Brentford, Mon 7.45pm Read Ed Aarons\u2019s match report from Kingsmeadow: Wally Downes, changed into his usual get-up \u2013 tinted glasses and a wonderful burnt orange cardigan \u2013 talks after that brilliant 4-2 win. Wimbledon are through to the fifth round, meaning they have gone further in the competition than Liverpool, Arsenal and Everton. \u201cI told them that it was a great game to blow away the cobwebs from the game on Tuesday night,\u201d Downes says. \u201cFootball\u2019s random, there is a load of analysis that we do but on any given day, any team can beat any team. On a one-off night, anybody can beat anybody.\u201d Of Toby Sibbick, the academy graduate who added Wimbledon\u2019s fourth, he adds: \u201cHe told me last week he\u2019s no good at heading it. But, Wimbledon has always been about young players coming through the youth system.\u201d Some AFC Wimbledon reaction. \u201cI thought the boys were excellent, and we need to make sure now that we do that every week,\u201d says Scott Wagstaff. \u201cToday\u2019s performance shows we can do it so now we have to pick up and show we can in the league. I\u2019m buzzing. We need to enjoy times like this, it doesn\u2019t happen very often.\u201d Wagstaff said pre-match that he would dye his hair in Wimbledon colours if they were to dump West Ham out. So, will he be keeping his promise? \u201cI\u2019m going to have to do it, I\u2019ll be true to my word. I\u2019m not sure my missus will be too happy, though.\u201d Toby Sibbick, who put the gloss on the victory, added: \u201cIt\u2019s one of the highlights for me, scoring against Premier League opposition.\u201d They\u2019ve done it! Wally Downes\u2019s side cruised into an unimaginable three-nil lead before having to dig deep to fend off West Ham\u2019s cavalry \u2013 Felipe Anderson and Lucas Perez both entered at half-time. Ryan Fredericks, who was also introduced at the break as Manuel Pellegrini made a triple change, made a difference too but, ultimately, a double by Scott Wagstaff and goals by Kwesi Appiah and Toby Sibbick sealed a famous victory over an off-colour West Ham. Just like that, the lowest scorers in League One have upset a Premier League side, and in some style. Wimbledon fully deserved the win; they turned up from start to finish, with goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale equally impressing too. 90+4 min: Ramsdale saves from Antonio! Another superb stop by the young England Under-21 goalkeeper. The ball drops at the back post, where Antonio has time to get it under control before Ramsdale gets a strong hand to his effort. 90+3 min: Manuel Pellegrini looks almost scared on the bench, his hands covering his mouth. There will be some serious questions for him to answer over his team selection and quite as to why his team were so painfully flat for the first 46 minutes. For West Ham, it was all too little too late. 90+2 min: And now Sibbick heads for the corner flag. \u201cWe want five,\u201d is the chant from the delirious Wimbledon fans. 90 min: There will be five added minutes. Ramsdale does brilliantly just as the fourth official holds up his board to smother the ball away from Antonio after the West Ham forward piled in at the back post in an attempt to force it home. Ramsdale stands strong. 89 min: What an occasion for 19-year-old Toby Sibbick! The teenager had been on the field less than three minutes but he has, surely, sealed victory. Just as West Ham thought they had survived, after Adrian saved a header from a Wordsworth corner, Wimbledon recycle the ball. It comes wide to the left. Wagstaff feeds Wordsworth, who dinks it in towards the back post. The youngster Sibbick is there in acres of space to nod in. 87 min: Sibbick wins a corner. Wimbledon are not exactly dying to get men forward, though still commit their centre-halves. 85 min: Connolly cannot carry on. Toby Sibbick replaces the Irishman, who has had a brilliant game despite inevitably fading. 84 min: Mark Noble takes aim from 25 yards, but it\u2019s a Row P job. 83 min: Connolly does well to stretch the West Ham back line, with the Wimbledon winger freeing the substitute Jake Jervis. But when the ball comes inside, Wimbledon waste it. Still, they could do with forcing West Ham on to the back foot a little more in these final stages. Some of Wimbledon\u2019s players are beginning to look very leggy. They are going to have to hold on tight. 81 min: It is slowly turning into a game of attack v defence, with West Ham sniffing around for an equaliser. Fredericks is penalised for catching Rod McDonald, earning Wimbledon a little respite. West Ham will surely happily take a replay given how shoddily they started this occasion at Kingsmeadow. 78 min: Masuaku is booked \u2013 for diving! Wordsworth chases Masuaku inside the box but the West Ham defender goes to ground all too easily, with Anthony Taylor immediately brandishing a yellow card. And the West Ham defender knows he has been caught red-handed, obligingly accepting the referee\u2019s decision. 77 min: Antonio has been relentless for West Ham since being pushed further forward in this second half. 76 min: Oshilaja has been brilliant, putting in a real skipper\u2019s shift for the hosts. He buys a throw-in out of Masuaku down the right flank and AFC Wimbledon earn another chance to pile on the pressure. Tennai Watson does brilliantly, skinning the defender but the Reading loanee is arguably too honest, desperately trying to stabilise himself after being clipped by Masuaku. West Ham survive, but that was another example of how Wimbledon are determined to not roll over just yet. 75 min: Kwesi Appiah is replaced by Jake Jervis. 73 min: Wimbledon pour forward and Oshilaja does superbly to win a corner. But West Ham clear their line before piling forward themselves, hitting straight back at them, only for Connolly to slide in and steal the ball back. Wimbledon are not shot yet. Felipe Anderson hammers it inside Ramsdale\u2019s near post. The net ripples as Anderson curls a free-kick through the Wimbledon wall and beyond the on-loan goalkeeper. Everybody was expecting Anderson to whip it into the far corner, but the Brazilian gives Ramsdale the eyes and bends it in the opposite side. West Ham have been a different beast this half. 70 min: Nightingale clips Snodgrass on the edge of the box. It is an inviting area for West Ham, 20 yards from goal, suited to a right-footer. Felipe Anderson fancies it. Ramsdale readies his wall. 69 min: West Ham accelerate up the other end and win a corner through Felipe Anderson. The Brazilian had switched on the afterburners when faced with Tennai Watson, who is no slouch himself. But Ramsdale punches the corner clear and Nightingale tidies things up. 68 min: Wordsworth stands up a free-kick towards the back post where an unmarked Oshilaja has snuck in. But the Wimbledon captain ends up scooping his cross out for a goal-kick. 66 min: Fredericks is booked for catching Appiah on the follow through. Meanwhile, a stat: no Premier League player has scored more goals as a substitute in all competitions this season than West Ham\u2019s Lucas P\u00e9rez (four \u2013 level with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang). 65 min: Tom Soares replaces Mitch Pinnock. Wimbledon will miss the option of the latter\u2019s long-throw but Soares, once of Crystal Palace, should offer a bit of nous. It\u2019s going to be a nervy final 25 minutes. Can a rejuvenated West Ham rescue a replay? 64 min: Michail Antonio, pushed up to right wing after Fredericks\u2019 introduction at the interval, is seeing more of the ball. He twists and turns inside before lashing a left-footed effort just wide. 62 min: Ramsdale gathers an ambitious cross from the left by Lucas Perez. West Ham are showing more urgency at least. 60 min: Another uncomfortable few moments for Ogbonna and Adrian in the West Ham defence. Wordsworth tries to wallop the ball goalwards but his own team-mate gets in the way. West Ham have solved their problems going forward but they look very vulnerable at the back. 59 min: Perez tries to stab a Snodgrass corner goalwards \u2013 but he cannot keep his effort down this time. West Ham are \u2013 slowly \u2013 trying to turn it on. They made a meal of the first 46 minutes but there is only one team in the ascendency at the moment. Fredericks and Anderson have been very lively. Lucas Perez smashes in after Ramsdale makes a brilliant save to deny Antonio after a brilliant low ball by the overlapping Fredericks. The latter has been superb in the 12 or so minutes since he has been on the field. A bit of pinball sees the ball drop at the feet of the Spaniard at an awkward but Perez spears an arrowed effort into the bottom corner. Pellegrini\u2019s body language has not changed an inch. Maybe this is just the start. Wimbledon have to keep being positive rather than invite pressure. 54 min: Hernandez skies his effort! West Ham pop the ball about, with Anderson again influential. The ball is slid into the Mexican by Fredericks, who has been lively, but the striker gets it all wrong. 53 min: Anderson slides in Fredericks, and West Ham win a corner. That was a cute little move. But they have helluva job on their hands to turn this around. Wimbledon are supercharged, West Ham still to truly get going. 50 min: Lucas Perez rolls around after being caught by Nightingale. He is soon up and moving, thankfully for West Ham, who have of course used up all of their substitutes at the interval. 49 min: Kingsmeadow is bouncing. Ah, that was not the plan. This half was supposed to be the start of the West Ham comeback, fresh from a triple change. But before Felipe Anderson, the club\u2019s \u00a336m record signing has even had the chance to touch the ball, Scott Wagstaff adds his second of the evening, stabbing home a volley after more good work by Connolly. A big scratch of the head for Manuel Pellegrini. 46 min: a triple West Ham change. Anderson, Fredericks and Lucas Perez replace Diangana, Carroll and Obiang. Pellegrini had to do something. Vinnie Jones, a FA Cup winner with Wimbledon in 1988, says: \u201cIt looks like the West Ham kit-man told the West Ham players not to crease up their shirts or get it too dirty tonight, because they are not really having a go. The second half is going to be different, the boys are going to run out of steam a little bit and it only takes a bit of magic from a Premier League player.\u201d Goals by Kwesi Appiah and Scott Wagstaff give AFC Wimbledon a two-goal cushion at the break. And the reality is they could have had more too. Their performance has been high-energy, full of gusto compared with West Ham, who have been painfully flat. Woeful. West Ham have not only not turned up, but they\u2019ve gifted possession away time and again. They cannot play much worse than that in the second half. Wimbledon will, of course, just want more of the same. Wally Downes looks very calm heading down the tunnel. He\u2019s not getting carried away. Not yet. 45 min: There will be one added minute. Wimbledon want another 90 of this. League One\u2019s bottom club have been brilliant. West Ham dire. 44 min: It should be three-nil! A routine ball towards the back post reaches an unmarked Oshilaja. He nods across goal, but nobody can get on the end of it. If they were not already Wimbledon could have been in dreamland then. West Ham are all over the place. They have got what they deserved. Pellegrini surely has to change things at half-time. 43 min: Another plucky West Ham foul, another Wimbledon free-kick. Credit to Wimbledon, who have harried the life out of West Ham. Scott Wagstaff doubles the hosts\u2019 lead. Pedro Obiang will not want to it again. Wagstaff and Appiah team up to hound Obiang out of possession before driving at goal. Faced one-on-one with the West Ham goalkeeper, the former Charlton winger coolly slots home. Adrian, meanwhile, looks close to tears. He\u2019s desperately trying to gee up the troops. There are a few heads in hands down on the West Ham bench, none more so than Se\u00f1or Pellegrini. 39 min: Ogbonna with another silly foul, on Appiah this time. Mitch Pinnock whips it in before Wordsworth lets fly from distance. It is a real piledriver, but West Ham get a body in the way. Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side have been nothing short of hopeless, really. They have barely strung a pass together. Wimbledon have been brilliant. 37 min: The Wombles are making a real racket. It was carnage in the stands as Kingsmeadow celebrated that Appiah strike. Down at the other end Aaron Ramsdale, the on-loan goalkeeper, clenched his fist as Connolly wheeled off towards the opposite corner in celebration. A delightful kind of pandemonium. A kind deflection helps the ball past Adrian, but the hosts get a well-deserved goal. Kwesi Appiah\u2019s shot is diverted by Angelo Ogbonna\u2019s big toe and that\u2019s enough to bamboozle Adrian, who had already gone to ground. Appiah, who scored a last-minute winner in the third round, has given Wimbledon the lead. West Ham cannot say it had not been coming. Carroll lost possession, Oshilaja then fed Wordsworth who, in turn, played a cute ball through to the Ghanaian forward. The rest is history. 31 min: Masuaku feeds Obiang inside. The midfielder looks up, has a pop ... and it arrows towards the corner flag. That\u2019s dreadful. 29 min: Oshilaja, the Wimbledon skipper, sends a West Ham ball thumping back where it came from. It has been relatively comfortable at the back for Wally Downes\u2019s side but he will know as well as anyone that his team need to strike while the iron\u2019s hot, and all that. Connolly has given Masuaku a real headache down the Hammers\u2019 left. 27 min: Adrian gladly wraps his hands around the ball after another slick AFC Wimbledon move. Appiah frees Connolly down the right flank, who stands up an inviting cross for Pinnock, at the back post. The winger rises highest but cannot get enough power on it trouble the West Ham goalkeeper. Still, another encouraging move by the hosts. 25 min: Pedro Obiang looks for Snodgrass but his pass goes astray. It has been that kind of night so far for West Ham. Wimbledon have done everything but score. They flew out of the blocks. 23 min: Snodgrass tugs at Connolly\u2019s shirt. The young Irishman \u2013 Wally Downes\u2019s first signing \u2013 is frustrating the life out of West Ham. Pinnock swings it in but West Ham win a goal-kick. 21 min: Carroll attempts a cross-field ball ... but plays it straight to Mitch Pinnock. That was poor. And then AFC Wimbledon bounce on to the counterattack, with the lively Connolly whipping in another devious ball into the box. Ogbonna swings a hopeful leg at it, swiping into thin air but West Ham get away with it. Wimbledon have them on the ropes. 20 min: Snodgrass springs into action down the left flank, twisting inside Watson before overrunning the ball. It ends up falling for Hernandez just inside the area but his effort is relatively tame. West Ham are beginning to find their feet, but they have looked a little clumsy when it\u2019s mattered. 16 min: Carroll tees up Hernandez, heading down for the Mexican who is lurking on the edge of the box. The striker has to hit it first time but gets it all wrong. Carroll did well, cushioning a lofted cross into the path of his strike-partner. West Ham, meanwhile, look nervy at the back, with Ogbonna hurrying to keep Wagstaff at bay. Pinnock lashes in another long-throw, but Adrian gathers Connolly\u2019s flicked header. 15 min: Connolly wins the ball out on the right after Snodgrass gifts away possession cheaply. Pinnock takes over the baton but his attempted curling effort from the edge of the box is always sailing over. 14 min: Dylan Connolly is causing real problems down the right flank. Issa Diop hacks clear another dangerous ball into the box. 12 min: Hernandez strikes a post! Snodgrass picks the ball up centrally, before freeing Hernandez who made a clever run off the full-back Tennai Watson. But the Wimbledon defender clawed back at his man to get a touch on Hernandez\u2019s strike, which is diverted on to the woodwork. Out of nowhere, West Ham come alive. They\u2019ve underwhelmed so far. 10 min: Terell Thomas is again involved in the box and the defender does brilliantly to keep the ball in play. West Ham are sleeping, with Adrian in no man\u2019s land as Thomas hooks a high ball back into the box from the byline. Connolly, a new arrival from Dundalk, was waiting totally unmarked in the six-yard box. West Ham totally switched off there. 9 min: Wimbledon win a free-kick on the edge of the area, with Angelo Ogbonna blocking off Dylan Connolly, who was en route into the 18-yard box. Connolly has had a very lively start, with his direct running causing havoc. Pinnock flashes the free-kick in with a left-footed bending effort but it is a good, strong save by Adrian, the West Ham goalkeeper. 7 min: Anthony Taylor, the referee, plays a clever advantage after a Wagstaff foul on halfway but West Ham fail to seize the opportunity. 6 min: Pinnock\u2019s corner is cleared but when the ball is helped into the box, Terell Thomas juggles the ball away from Issa Diop superbly before shooting wide. He did the hard part, wriggling away from his marker but the defender looks a bit lost in the opposition box and his effort is wild. Kwesi Appiah screams that he was lurking to take over but, in fairness, Thomas had to have a pot. It would have been some goal. 5 min: Nightingale slides in Connolly, who flashes a dangerous ball across the box. It\u2019s a delicious ball that bounces across the six-yard box and West Ham eventually clear their lines. AFC Wimbledon win a corner .. 4 min: Snodgrass nudges the ball in to Masuaku, but the wing-back runs into trouble in the shape of Reading loanee Tennai Watson. 3 min: Mitch Pinnock\u2019s long-throw is not dealt with and Nightingale rifles a shot from the edge of the box. It\u2019s deflected and Obiang takes all of the sting out of it. That\u2019s a weapon that West Ham will have to be ready for. 2 min: A brilliant, hanging free-kick by Robert Snodgrass \u2013 but Andy Carroll\u2019s free header is wayward. It ends up falling back for the kick-taker but Snodgrass cannot get his effort on target. A lively start by the visitors. 2 min: A positive start by West Ham, with Antonio back on the front foot down the right allowing Hernandez to win a corner. 1 min: Michail Antonio, again operating from right-back, tries to play the ball forward but the hosts snuff it out. West Ham switch it down the left, where Arthur Masuaku will himself probe. Andy Carroll and Javier Hernandez get us under way. Here we go, then. Can AFC Wimbledon mirror Millwall\u2019s heroics at Kingsmeadow and send West Ham packing? Let\u2019s see. Meanwhile, Everton are out of the FA Cup: For all of the hot air around Marko Arnautovic, West Ham remain in talks with Celta Vigo over Maxi G\u00f3mez, whose contract contains a \u00a343.5m release clause. The Spanish club, however, are battling relegation from La Liga and want to keep the 22-year-old. Intriguingly, one possibility could be a deal being done in this window before loaning him back until the end of the season. Any deal would eclipsing the club-record \u00a336m they paid Lazio for Felipe Anderson in the summer. Gomez, part of the Uruguay squad at last summer\u2019s World Cup, joined Celta in 2017 on a five-year deal. A heartening pre-match tale, courtesy of none other than Jesse Lingard. A bunch of AFC Wimbledon fans were in with a shot of winning \u00a3500 in a penalty shootout on Soccer AM this morning, only for the Manchester United winger \u2013 supposedly giving them a helping hand \u2013 to miss a crucial spot-kick, leaving the supporters out of pocket. But Lingard made a bee-line for the group of fans after the show, and promptly handed over \u00a3600 of his own money in the Sky studios car park. Lovely. Team news news: so, no Marko Arnautovic for West Ham, but Manuel Pellegrini names a strong side nevertheless, including Javier Hernandez and Andy Carroll. Declan Rice is rested, on the bench alongside Felipe Anderson. The former Charlton winger Scott Wagstaff starts for AFC Wimbledon, as does the Bournemouth loanee Aaron Ramsdale. AFC Wimbledon: Ramsdale, Watson, Thomas, Oshilaja, McDonald, Nightingale, Wordsworth, Connolly, Pinnock, Appiah, Wagstaff Subs: McDonnell, Sibbick, Garratt, Trotter, Soares, Jervis, Pigott West Ham United: Adrian, Antonio, Diop, Ogbonna, Masuaku, Noble, Obiang, Snodgrass, Diangana, Hernandez, Carroll Subs: Fabianski, Fredericks, Rice, Coventry, Holland, Anderson, Perez Referee: Anthony Taylor This one has the scent of a proper upset. After near-misses at New Meadow and the Riverside earlier, AFC Wimbledon, at the wrong end of League One, up against a Jeykll and Hyde West Ham United \u2013 a team dining at the top table \u2013 has the makings of a cup classic.

Yes, ten million dollars a year.</p> \n<p>At the moment the top marginal tax rate in the US is 37% on income of more than $510,300 for individuals and $612,350 for married couples.</p> \n<p>That a tax rate kicking in at such an absurdly high income is enough to bring out a fit of vapours among the conservatives in her nation and those in Davos this week reveals just how scared they are that people have cottoned on to their rigged system.</p> \n<p>In a <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/videos/business/2019/01/23/wef-davos-2019-dell-70-percent-tax-lon-orig.cnn/video/playlists/business-davos/\">forum in Davos, Michael Dell</a> \u2013 the 39<sup>th</sup> richest person in the world \u2013 was asked if he was in favour of that tax proposal. Naturally the audience tittered, and Dell responded by talking up his own foundation and made the rather weird claim that he has contributed more to that over the past 20 years than he would have through the 70% tax rate.</p> \n<p>Dell seemed unable to grasp that he could still give to charities (and enjoy the tax benefits of doing so) while paying a higher tax rate. Indeed given his foundation provides money for urban education, such a tax rate might actually reduce the need for his personal support.</p> \n<p>But then such billionaires often think the world just needs more Ebenezer Scrooges after he has learned his Christmas Carol lessons rather than an employment, education and health system in place that does not have children like Tiny Tim subject to the whims of wealthy.</p> \n<p>Dell, however, then overplayed his hand by claiming in what he thought was the coup de grace that he didn\u2019t \u201cthink it would help the growth of the US economy ... name a country where that\u2019s worked \u2013 ever\u201d.</p> \n<p>At this point fellow panellist and MIT professor Erik Brynjolfsson helpfully responded: \u201cthe United States\u201d. He further noted that the tax rate had been at that level \u201cfrom about the 1930s through about the 1960s\u201d and what is more \u201cthere is actually a lot of economics that suggests that it\u2019s not necessarily going to hurt growth\u201d.</p> \n<p>At least Dell wasn\u2019t as silly as Ken Moelis, chief executive of investment bank Moelis &amp; Co, who in an interview with Bloomberg television suggested \u201cIt would be disastrous for the economy\u201d, because \u201cyou have to incentivise people. Even in the US, what\u2019s going to happen to the two-workforce family?

      "bodyText": "My goodness they\u2019re getting scared. Their world, which has them at the top of the heap, setting \u2013 nay, rigging \u2013 the rules, and where they can repeat to themselves over and over that their success is all about merit and personal brilliance, is cracking all around them. They\u2019re scared and have retreated into stupidity and fallacy. This week the wealthy parked their private jets in Davos in Switzerland for the annual \u201cYes we really think we\u2019re better than you\u201d conference, otherwise known as the World Economic Forum. It\u2019s a place where concerns are focused mostly on worries about wealth and where interlopers such as New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, pointing out the obvious on climate change is seen as revelatory. We\u2019re now a decade past the global financial crisis \u2013 an event that completely revealed the abject failure of capitalism unfettered by strong government oversight \u2013 and yet the conservatives have taken on board the lessons of the GFC by pretending it didn\u2019t happen and hoping in spite of all evidence to the contrary that the world has not greatly changed. We are now many decades into climate change revealing itself as the greatest market failure in human history, and yet still we find intransigence and delusion from the conservatives, who cry socialism in response to policy proposals in the vain hope that anyone is still scared by such a notion and the misguided belief that we cannot all see their lack of clothes. Consider the reaction to Democratic congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez proposing a tax plan with a marginal rate of 70% for incomes over $10m. Yes, ten million dollars a year. At the moment the top marginal tax rate in the US is 37% on income of more than $510,300 for individuals and $612,350 for married couples. That a tax rate kicking in at such an absurdly high income is enough to bring out a fit of vapours among the conservatives in her nation and those in Davos this week reveals just how scared they are that people have cottoned on to their rigged system. In a forum in Davos, Michael Dell \u2013 the 39th richest person in the world \u2013 was asked if he was in favour of that tax proposal. Naturally the audience tittered, and Dell responded by talking up his own foundation and made the rather weird claim that he has contributed more to that over the past 20 years than he would have through the 70% tax rate. Dell seemed unable to grasp that he could still give to charities (and enjoy the tax benefits of doing so) while paying a higher tax rate. Indeed given his foundation provides money for urban education, such a tax rate might actually reduce the need for his personal support. But then such billionaires often think the world just needs more Ebenezer Scrooges after he has learned his Christmas Carol lessons rather than an employment, education and health system in place that does not have children like Tiny Tim subject to the whims of wealthy. Dell, however, then overplayed his hand by claiming in what he thought was the coup de grace that he didn\u2019t \u201cthink it would help the growth of the US economy ... name a country where that\u2019s worked \u2013 ever\u201d. At this point fellow panellist and MIT professor Erik Brynjolfsson helpfully responded: \u201cthe United States\u201d. He further noted that the tax rate had been at that level \u201cfrom about the 1930s through about the 1960s\u201d and what is more \u201cthere is actually a lot of economics that suggests that it\u2019s not necessarily going to hurt growth\u201d. At least Dell wasn\u2019t as silly as Ken Moelis, chief executive of investment bank Moelis &amp; Co, who in an interview with Bloomberg television suggested \u201cIt would be disastrous for the economy\u201d, because \u201cyou have to incentivise people. Even in the US, what\u2019s going to happen to the two-workforce family? You forget where 70% starts to kick in.\u201d Remember \u2013 we\u2019re talking ten million dollars of income a year, and a 70% rate only for income above that amount. We of course have also seen fear disconnected with reality here in Australia. For example, after the budget, the AFR tried to convince people that the government income tax cuts were for middle incomes earners by suggesting someone earning $200,000 could soon be considered middle class. (Yes, in 2056 by my calculations). And we saw it again this week in a speech given by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg. Fortunately for Frydenbrg, coverage of his speech was smothered by the prime minister talking about James Cook, because so filled was it with dead phrases such as \u201cthe invisible hand of capitalism delivers far more than the dead hand of socialism\u201d that not only would anyone in the audience have done well to stay awake, Frydenberg himself should be commended for not drifting off part way through. It is sad but not surprising that Frydenberg has continued on from last year with warnings the ALP is indulging in \u201cclass warfare\u201d and that it wants to \u201ctax itself into prosperity\u201d. Sure no one is listening but it would be nice to see the treasurer at least try for some originality, or failing that at least some reality. Frydenberg suggested that there was a \u201cgrowing chorus of opposition\u201d to the ALP\u2019s polices, which I guess he might come to believe if he keeps saying it. But as he also thinks saying \u201cLabor\u2019s tax and redistribution agenda is one of the most radical, aggressive and dangerous Australia has ever seen\u201d is a winning argument, I suspect there is little chance of that chorus every becoming a reality. Radicalism used to mean something. Changing the treatment of dividend imputation to how it was when set up by Paul Keating in the 1980s is hardly the return of Leon Trotsky. Yes mostly this is about the Liberal party realising it is facing an election defeat and thus is hoping scare tactics will be enough. Governments always do this when approaching defeat. But the rhetoric from the government and its media supporters reflects that of those who have used the policies of the past 40 years to entrench their positions and who now are confronted with people saying the jig is up. Whether it came via rising inequality, reduced government services, climate change or just a growing realisation that the story being told does not reflect reality, change is coming, and those in power are scared, and are powerless to offer anything other than fear in return.",

She has been an activist for most of her life and always imagined devoting her retirement to helping bring about social change. Even so, the sharp turn away from a successful academic career came suddenly. \u201cI\u2019ve been very committed to [my] career,\u201d she says. \u201cThis was not a forward plan, but this is an emergency facing the whole globe. There\u2019s a level of urgency I did not predict when I was a young woman.\u201d Heath helps to run Extinction Rebellion, a climate protest group, in Adelaide. She hopes to help recruit more retirees and older Australians. \u201cI\u2019ve never participated in a social movement where there are so many older people involved already,\u201d she says. \u201cAs we\u2019ve got more and more older people in the population ... some of us are financially able. We\u2019re well enough, we\u2019ve got more time to devote. \u201cWe had a planning meeting this morning, and it occurs to me that a lot of people who aren\u2019t activists don\u2019t realise that activism can be exciting and fun. Participating with people who share your values and your passion \u2013 that is pretty awesome and a source of great friendships and mutual support. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to get out there and do something, rather than lying awake at night worrying about these sorts of things.\u201d",

It said that in recent days alone, it had been told that 35 firms had activated plans to move operations out of the UK, or were stockpiling goods to combat the worst effects of Brexit. Matt Griffith, director of policy at the BCC\u2019s west of England branch, said that many more companies had acted to protect themselves since May\u2019s Brexit deal was decisively rejected by MPs in the Commons earlier this month. He said: \u201cSince the defeat for the prime minister\u2019s deal, we have seen a sharp increase in companies taking actions to try and protect themselves from the worst effects of a no-deal Brexit. No deal has gone from being one of several possible scenarios to a firm date in the diary.\u201d Labour MP Yvette Cooper has revealed to the Observer that two major employers in her West Yorkshire constituency \u2013 luxury goods manufacturer Burberry and confectioner Haribo \u2013 had both written to her, warning of the damaging effects of no deal on their UK operations. Burberry employs 750 people in Castleford, and Haribo 700 across her constituency. Cooper is pushing for a Commons amendment \u2013 likely to be voted on in Tuesday\u2019s debate \u2013 that would pave the way for Brexit to be delayed until the end of this year. Last week some of the UK\u2019s largest employers \u2013 including Airbus, Europe\u2019s largest aerospace manufacturer, which employs 14,000 people in the UK and supports another 110,000 through supply chains \u2013 warned of potentially disastrous effects of no deal on its UK activities. Tom Enders, the boss of Airbus, said: \u201cPlease don\u2019t listen to the Brexiters\u2019 madness, which asserts that because we have huge plants here we will not move and we will always be here. They are wrong.\u201d Ever since the vote to leave the EU in 2016, business groups including the BCC and the Confederation of British Industry have lobbied ministers, arguing that our exporters need access to the EU\u2019s customs union, which allows goods to be imported tariff-free. But the prime minister has insisted that the UK must leave both the customs union and EU single market if it the referendum result of 2016 is to be fully respected. Business concerns are growing as Downing Street braces for a series of Commons ambushes over Brexit this week. As well as moves to delay the date of leaving beyond 29 March, MPs worried about a cliff-edge exit or a hard Brexit are also planning to force a series of \u201cindicative votes\u201d in parliament on a range of alternative ways forward. These include a Norway-style arrangement and a second referendum. Some ministers, including Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, and Richard Harrington, the business minister, have signalled they could quit if May does not allow them to back plans to delay Brexit by granting all Tory MPs including ministers a free vote on the issue. Meanwhile, some pro-Brexit cabinet ministers are pushing the PM to submit her own amendment pledging to renegotiate her Brexit deal, in a bid to win over Tory Brexiters and the Northern Irish DUP. Concerns are growing within the Tory party that the impasse may end in a snap election. Today, writing in the Observer, cabinet minister David Lidington says he shares the concerns of those worried about no deal and says the government intends to put a revised deal back to the Commons for another \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d next month. \u201cOnce we have a blueprint for a plan that can secure the support of the House, the prime minister will go back to the EU,\u201d Lidington writes. \u201cMPs will then have another meaningful vote as soon as possible.\u201d Meanwhile European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has warned Theresa May in a private phone call that shifting her position in favour of a permanent customs union is the price she will need to pay for the EU revising the Irish backstop. He said without a major shift in the PM\u2019s position, the current terms of the withdrawal agreement were \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d. Details of the call, contained in a leaked diplomatic note, emerged as Juncker\u2019s deputy, Frans Timmermans, told the Observer that there had been no weakening of the resolve in Brussels in support of Ireland, and accused the Tory Brexiters of a \u201ccavalier\u201d approach to peace. \u201cLet me be extremely clear: there is no way I could live in a situation where we throw Ireland under the bus,\u201d Timmermans said.",

      "body": "<p>Walk into a school and some things will strike you right away. Is the atmosphere respectful and warm? How do children interact with their teachers? What sort of project work takes pride of place on the corridor walls?</p> <p>One thing that you can\u2019t immediately tell from wandering from classroom to classroom is whether the school is an academy, run by a not-for-profit organisation independent of the local council, or a \u201cmaintained\u201d school under local council oversight. When things are going well, parents may barely notice the difference. But when things are going badly, it matters and that\u2019s why the extraordinary growth of academy schools has become one of the most hotly contested developments in education policy.</p> <p>Last week marked an important milestone in the English school system: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/education-secretary-calls-on-more-schools-to-become-an-academy\" title=\"\">more than half of pupils </a>are being educated in academies. It has been an astonishingly rapid transformation: the Labour government left around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jul/22/academy-schools-scandal-failing-trusts\" title=\"\">200 academy schools</a> in 2010; today, there are more than 8,000.</p> <p>The debate can often feel polarised between those who think this a tremendous development and those who argue that we need to turn the clock back. Seven years in the hardest job I\u2019ve ever done tells me the truth lies somewhere in between.</p> <p>When I bowled up at the gates of a local primary school almost a decade ago, I thought that having written a couple of thinktank reports on education policy would make me well equipped to be a school governor. Boy, was I wrong. If you\u2019ve never stood at the front of a classroom, there\u2019s a dauntingly steep learning curve to effectively undertaking the \u201csupport and challenge\u201d role of a school governor. In seven years, I never felt like I mastered it.</p> <p>During my tenure, our school converted into an academy, which gave me a flavour of the pros and cons of both arrangements. As a maintained school, the support we got from the council was sometimes brilliant, sometimes poor; in some areas of the country, it\u2019s consistently great or terrible.</p> <p>When I joined, the school was struggling; we eventually managed to recruit an amazing head who produced an outstanding Ofsted judgment in just five terms. It always struck me as a waste that such an exceptional leader was in charge of the education of 300 kids rather than 3,000.

      "bodyText": "Walk into a school and some things will strike you right away. Is the atmosphere respectful and warm? How do children interact with their teachers? What sort of project work takes pride of place on the corridor walls? One thing that you can\u2019t immediately tell from wandering from classroom to classroom is whether the school is an academy, run by a not-for-profit organisation independent of the local council, or a \u201cmaintained\u201d school under local council oversight. When things are going well, parents may barely notice the difference. But when things are going badly, it matters and that\u2019s why the extraordinary growth of academy schools has become one of the most hotly contested developments in education policy. Last week marked an important milestone in the English school system: more than half of pupils are being educated in academies. It has been an astonishingly rapid transformation: the Labour government left around 200 academy schools in 2010; today, there are more than 8,000. The debate can often feel polarised between those who think this a tremendous development and those who argue that we need to turn the clock back. Seven years in the hardest job I\u2019ve ever done tells me the truth lies somewhere in between. When I bowled up at the gates of a local primary school almost a decade ago, I thought that having written a couple of thinktank reports on education policy would make me well equipped to be a school governor. Boy, was I wrong. If you\u2019ve never stood at the front of a classroom, there\u2019s a dauntingly steep learning curve to effectively undertaking the \u201csupport and challenge\u201d role of a school governor. In seven years, I never felt like I mastered it. During my tenure, our school converted into an academy, which gave me a flavour of the pros and cons of both arrangements. As a maintained school, the support we got from the council was sometimes brilliant, sometimes poor; in some areas of the country, it\u2019s consistently great or terrible. When I joined, the school was struggling; we eventually managed to recruit an amazing head who produced an outstanding Ofsted judgment in just five terms. It always struck me as a waste that such an exceptional leader was in charge of the education of 300 kids rather than 3,000. Meanwhile, the then Tory education secretary, Michael Gove, was putting rocket boosters under Labour\u2019s academy programme and brought in business and philanthropic leaders to transform a small number of struggling schools, with mixed results. Despite that, Gove wanted to turn far more schools into academies \u2013 his vision was for a market-based approach to school improvement. Competing organisations would run chains of schools outside local government control, while failing schools would be taken over by high-performing chains. There was a massive inbuilt flaw to this idea: once an academy trust takes over a school, it ceases to exist as a legal and financial entity \u2013 it is wholly absorbed. The only way out is if a trust is doing so catastrophically that the government forces it to give up its schools. There are some brilliant academy chains \u2013 and some that are desperately failing. But the government now forces all struggling schools to join a chain and there aren\u2019t enough good ones, so many end up joining, at best, the average performers. Too often, the chains they join can\u2019t cope, which means that the situation in a school becomes worse, not better. A damning public accounts committee report last week highlighted how it can become all but impossible for parents to get answers when this happens and it can take years for schools to get \u201crebrokered\u201d from a failing trust to a better one. I know from experience.

A long pause while the umpires try and decide whether a sweeping Anderson has touched the ball reverse-sweeping or if it was lbw.... 79th over: England 237-9 (Curran 12, Anderson 0) Chase desperate for that final wicket, but this last pair prod him away. 78th over: England 237-9 (Curran 10, Anderson 0) One off John Campbell\u2019s over. 77th over: England 235-9 (Curran 10, Anderson 0) That wasn\u2019t really a great shot there by Rashid. A sort of thoughtless paddling-whip. And apparently Chase has the best figures by a West Indian spinner since 1971. Courtesy of John Starbuck: Oh, what can you say about Chase? He may not be good in a race, But spinning it slightly,Exceedingly flighty, The batters are done by no pace. Yes, it\u2019s him again! Rashid whips Chase straight into the hands of Brathwaite on the boundary. 76th over: England 234-8 (Curran 9, Rashid 1) Sam Curran! He pulls Gabriel for four, with a whip-cracking bottom hand. Then Rashid with Nonchalence by David Gower liberally sprayed all over, rocks him back for single that deserved a four. Kandukuru Nagarjun writes: \u201cYou bringing up Patrick Patterson reminded me of his disappearance from public view, years of innuendo and rumour, and eventual (tragic) resurfacing through one of the great feats of investigative journalism in sport: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpT5TPUmeCQ \u201cI wonder; who are some famous ex-cricketers we haven\u2019t heard from for a decade or more? The Australian beanpole Bruce Reid and Pakistani reverse swinger Sarfraz Nawaz come to mind. Who else?\u201d 75th over: England 228-8 (Curran 4, Rashid 0) Oh what can you say about Chase? (in the style of Pam Ayers) With a bit of this, a bit of that he\u2019s destroyed England\u2019s second innings. Foakes down on one knee, sweeps, and is caught superbly at short leg tucked into the body. The young man Chase now has SIX. 74th over: England 228-7 (Curran 4, Foakes 0) Gabriel pounds in. Foakes pulls him for four, then flicks away a single and Curran, bounced out in the first innings is waiting....there\u2019s the bouncer, but it is wide. Oh and there are lots of pink middle-aged English people in a paddling pool. They look like very happy zoo exhibits. Peter Salmon is curious:\u201cI like that you can pop into the next room where they are playing Cluedo. Make me think that all the OBO\u2019s come from some Borgesian wonderland... \u2018In this room they are playing at Cluedo. In this, Tanya is playing at cricket, or the idea of cricket. Open the further door and Professor Voltar plays chess with the rooks removed. And in the final room the Don Quixote, or a man who believes himself to be Don Quixote, turns an hourglass over and over, testing a theory about the effects of time on sixteenth century metaphysics.\u2019 Is that what it\u2019s like?\u201d Yes, that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s like. Except I forgot: upstairs the teenager is looking at god-knows-what on the phone and I can\u2019t unplug the wifi till the end of the day\u2019s play... 73rd over: England 222-7 (Curran 4, Foakes 0) Curran off the mark with a boyish four through the covers. Quite charming. Chase raises the scarlet globe in the air to acknowledge the crowd\u2019s applause. A magnificent flying double-handed, rib-banging, snaffle by Campbell at short mid-wicket. And that is five wickets for Chase! 72nd over: England 218-6 (Buttler 26, Foakes 0) Holder hands the ball to Gabriel for the first full over after tea. The shadows are shortening and the breeze blowing the lions across Buttler\u2019s chest. Foakes gets a lifter first ball Rashid stares thoughtfully round the dressing room door - if a spinner is dropped for Broad in the next test, might it now be Moeen? John Little is in the mood for a scolding: \u201cAt lunch it was only more runs than Holder, now we have more than the whole W Indies 1st innings. This \u201cnot what the doctor ordered (1845)\u201c is all a bit too defeatist for my taste. Buck up OBOers\u201d 71 overs: England 217-6 (Buttler 25, Foakes 0) I just popped next door where they\u2019re playing Cluedo. \u201cWrench, Peacock, Bedroom,\u201d was the cry as I wafted away with my plate of toad in the hole. For England, it\u2019s been \u201c Chase, Drifters, Sunshine.\u201d 70.5 overs and TEA: England 217-6 (Buttler 25 )Well that wasn\u2019t quite what the doctor ordered - four wickets lost in the session for 82 runs. A mission once extremely unlikely, now completely impossible. The West Indies kept on keeping on, a primary school teacher might describe England as \u201chaving a few problems keeping on task.\u201d Yikes, a pair for Moeen, with a hand-over-face back-foot glide straight to Jason Holder at second slip. 70th over: England 216-5 (Ali 0, Buttler 24) Gabriel has served his time in the long-grass after hobbling off the field mid-session for some repair work. Buttler scampers merrily away to the non-striker\u2019s end after one ball and Moeen, on a pair, is greeted as is the custom. Two short ones in a row Is it just me or does Gabriel look like a bit like Patrick Patterson? 69th over: England 215-5 (Ali 0, Buttler 23) That\u2019s a bad blow for England, ten minutes short of tea. Stokes just missed one that didn\u2019t do very much - after he\u2019d just passed 3000 Test runs too. The not-at-all-mysterious Chase strikes again. No huge turn, a bit of drift and that\u2019s out! The dominoes are teetering. 68th over: England 209-4 (Stokes 33, Buttler 18) Jon Campbell\u2019s turn now, blue shades, long sleeves and fairly accurate off-spin. Stokes and Buttler have been briefly re-caged. Kim writes from Finedon. \u201cI bet it\u2019s hammering down even harder here in Finedon, home of the DancingVicar\u2122\ufe0f\ud83d\udd7a\ud83c\udffb \u201cHow about a mention for the very wonderful Finedon Dolben Cricket Club and all the wonderful work they do at grassroots level for their juniors, the male and female cricket stars of tomorrow. Clubs all round the country like them too, fostering development of young Sam and Samantha Currans.\u201d Yes, a big, fat, glorious Hurrah to Finedon Dolben CC! 67th over: England 206-4 (Stokes 30, Buttler 18) An aeroplane shimmers through the azure sky, a gentleman in a breton polo shirt plays the sax and the breeze blows a Barmy Army flag that seems to say something like \u201cBurfer\u201d (I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to leave that with you. ) That was a maiden from Joseph by the way. 66th over: England 206-4 (Stokes 30, Buttler 18) Plink and plonk. A lovely email from Andrew Parker. \u201cWas watching a video about the amazing Windies attack of the 70s and 80s with Roberts, Holding, Croft, Marshall, etc, and they interviewed Ian Botham about it. He said that looking somewhat nervously at the West Indies team-sheet, he asked where the spin bowlers were, and the answer came back \u201cJoel Garner is our slow bowler.\u201d Hehe, made me laugh. Is this present day WI team going to bring back past glories?\u201d Those glories were so glorious Andrew that a I doubt it. Be great to see them rise up though. 65th over: England 204-4 (Stokes 29, Buttler 17) Holder is switching his bowlers around like a man with a dodgy hand. He turns to Joseph. A not completely convincing boundary from Stokes, an awkward swivelled pull. And that\u2019s the 200 up. Just another 428 to go. Buttler takes it as a personal affront , and toe-drives the next ball for four through long-off. 64th over: England 195-4 (Stokes 24, Buttler 13) A couple from Chase\u2019s over, an inside-edge nibble from Stokes falls short of short-leg. 63rd over: England 193-4 (Stokes 23, Buttler 12) Just one from Roach\u2019s over. \u201cHi Tanya\u201d Hi Dave \u201cJust wanting to say that far from enjoying England go down (I\u2019m sure there will be a last stand partnership to win the day), I love the idea of a resurgence in West Indies cricket. \u201cIts like a rebalancing of the equation, a punch you never saw coming, an eighties revival just when we seemed doomed to a future of auto-tune. Sorry if that wasn\u2019t left field enough but the concept is indeed exciting. Cheers and enjoy the Red Stripe.\u201d A rebalancing indeed. Oh, and much as I\u2019d love to be supping Red Stripe in Barbados, it\u2019s tea in soggy northern suburbia. 62nd over: England 192-4 (Stokes 23, Buttler 11) When will the real Ben Stokes..? Oh, now. He whallops Chase for four to long-on. Then a little shimmy and a drive, straighter, for six. Ten from the over. 61st over: England 182-4 (Stokes 13, Buttler 11) Roach replaces Holder and takes a round-the-wicket approach to Ben Stokes. He escapes to the other end. What the heck says Buttler, he swivels and pulls a four , then next ball rocks onto the back foot and drives beautifully through the covers. Consecutive boundaries. Also, I meant to say thank you Simon - an eventful rum-punch to cress sandwich session. 60th over: England 173-4 (Stokes 12, Buttler 3) The lanky Chase, who\u2019s already pocketed the key wickets Burns and Root, high-arms in, wrists touching sleeves Ooooch, Buttler avoids an edge by the width of a half-penny to the last ball of the over. 59th over: England 170-4 (Stokes 11, Buttler 1) Hello everyone! This morning I heard England\u2019s chances being described as having to knock 40 minutes off the marathon world record.After Root\u2019s dismissal, they\u2019re behind the clock with a burst blister, sore knee and leaking water bottle. Holder continues and England look watchful. 58th over: England 167-4 (Stokes 9, Buttler 0) Root is absolutely furious with himself as he trudges from the field. Not only is he out, he also misses out on drinks, which are taken mid-over while Jos Buttler makes his way out to replace him. And with that I\u2019ll hand you over to Tanya Aldred \u2013 you can email her here, or get in touch on ye Twitter here. Bye! I tell you something, I think West Indies might win this. There\u2019s no real spin here, but Root attempts to work the ball to backward point and only diverts it to slip! 57th over: England 166-3 (Root 22, Stokes 8) Root slices his drive past point and gets four runs for his troubles. 56th over: England 162-3 (Root 18, Stokes 8) Stokes tries to drive Chase now, and he misses this one as well. He\u2019s taken 37 balls so far over his eight runs, and fielded few of them well. 55th over: England 161-3 (Root 17, Stokes 8) Holder bowls across Stokes, who twice tries to drive and twice swishes through nothing but air. His timing is entirely awry, but he\u2019s somehow clinging on. 54th over: England 161-3 (Root 17, Stokes 8) Chase continues, with a couple of slips and a short leg installed around the bat. Both batsmen add a single to their totals, but neither is quite convincing at the moment. 53rd over: England 159-3 (Root 16, Stokes 7) Stokes attacks Holder\u2019s opening delivery, but having taken a couple of steps forward has to abandon the idea when the ball goes somewhere other than where he wanted it to. His ambitions are most emphatically reined in from there. England, incidentally, are now more than 25% of the way to their target! 52nd over: England 159-3 (Root 16, Stokes 7) Chase continues, and a couple of singles ensue. 51st over: England 157-3 (Root 15, Stokes 6) Gabriel tries to york Stokes, at 150kph no less, but it\u2019s not quite on the money and the batsman jabs his bat onto it. Then Stokes drives down the ground for four, with Gabriel limping and massaging his foot as the ball is fielded, and another full toss later he leaves the field, with one ball unbowled. John Campbell does the honours. 50th over: England 150-3 (Root 12, Stokes 2) England reach 150 in the 50th over, which is mathematically handy. Stokes ends the over by getting all in a muddle, but survives after getting something on the ball. Stokes got a thick edge to that before it hit his pad, and he is very much not out. West Indies didn\u2019t really commit to their appeal, but however half-hearted it was the umpire was sold. 49th over: England 148-3 (Root 11, Stokes 1) Stokes, having shown little ambition to do anything but survive the over, pulls the fifth ball for a single, and then Root clips the last to deep square leg, where it\u2019s misfielded on the boundary. 48th over: England 143-3 (Root 7, Stokes 0) A maiden over from Chase, his first of the match (he didn\u2019t bowl in England\u2019s first innings). 47th over: England 143-3 (Root 7, Stokes 0) Gabriel bowls short but wide, and Root flays it away for four. It\u2019s a rare poor delivery in a spell of pace and aggression from Gabriel, and it\u2019s all too much for Bairstow, who gets the featheriest of touches onto the ball and is on his way. This match has really swung away from England in the last 10 minutes or so. This time they have their wicket! Bairstow gloves the ball down the leg side, and Hope takes a simple catch! 46th over: England 138-2 (Bairstow 30, Root 2) Suddenly, stuff is happening. West Indies were an inch here and a couple of inches there from taking two wickets in the last two overs, but will have to make do with the sense of panic and potential that has suddenly descended. That looked a decent shout, but the ball hit the batsman outside the line of off stump, and thus he is saved. But the umpire doesn\u2019t agree, so they\u2019re going upstairs \u2026 45th over: England 136-2 (Bairstow 30, Root 1) That wasn\u2019t even close. Gabriel left an acre of lawn between the crease and the back of his foot as he banged the ball in (sticklers for accuracy would perhaps measure it at about six inches) and West Indies\u2019 joyful celebrations are curtailed, with Root most of the way back to the pavilion. The bowler tries a repeat dose, and Root looks unhappy about that as well. so there\u2019s one more to end the over, banged in at 145kph, and this one spins off the fingers of Root\u2019s glove and down the leg side, out of reach both of short leg and the keeper. England\u2019s captain will not have enjoyed the last few minutes of his life. That\u2019s a cracker from Gabriel, who gets one to rear up into Root, who gloves to slip \u2026 but it\u2019s a no ball! 44th over: England 134-2 (Bairstow 29, Root 1) A Root single completes Chase\u2019s over. The players are back out, with Root joining Bairstow in the middle. \u201cI just feel the game swung psychologically in England\u2019s favour when the lead dropped below the five hundred mark,\u201d insists Dean Kinsella. Yes, just 494 to go now. It\u2019s just a matter of time. On the plus side, as John Little points out via email, England have now, across their two innings, scored more runs than Jason Holder. So there\u2019s that. After discussing and criticising his technique for a while, Paul Collingwood declares his belief that Keaton Jennings can still make it as a Test opener: I\u2019m a big believer that this man can make it. I love his character. He\u2019s a strong character. His work ethic. All those boxes you need to be ticked. The problem at the moment, and it\u2019s a big problem, is he isn\u2019t scoring the runs. 43.5 overs: England 134-2 ( Bairstow 29) Bairstow welcomes Chase with a lovely shot off his pads and wide of long-on for four, but then a single brings Burns onto strike. He falls with just one run of the session to go, and West Indies depart with a bit of bonus spring in their step! Chase coaxes the ball through the gate and into off stump, with Burns trying to defend! 43rd over: England 129-1 (Burns 84, Bairstow 24) The scoring rate has dipped significantly of late, as the lunch interval hoves into view. Roston Chase has just been handed the ball, so there might be two overs before it happens. 42nd over: England 127-1 (Burns 83, Bairstow 23) Roach keeps going, his 12th over of the innings, and it\u2019s his third maiden. 41st over: England 127-1 (Burns 83, Bairstow 23) England are now 20% of the way to their still extremely distant target. Just another 501 runs required. 40th over: England 125-1 (Burns 81, Bairstow 23) Oooh! Roach\u2019s second delivery deviates off the seam and flies just past Bairstow\u2019s bat. Lovely work that from the bowler. Then Bairstow zings the ball off his pads and through midwicket for four! 39th over: England 121-1 (Burns 81, Bairstow 19) Yeeesh! Burns guides the ball down to third man again, though he sends the ball just wide (and also lands just short) of a diving Holder at second slip. 38th over: England 117-1 (Burns 77, Bairstow 19) Roach bowls short and straight, and Bairstow flicks it to deep midwicket for four, nicely timed. So Roach bowls a similar length but wider, and Bairstow tucks that one away as well. Roach then bowls another delivery very similar to that first one, and this time Bairstow gets his timing wrong, the ball catches the leading edge and lands safe. Roach\u2019s follow-up is identical to last time \u2013 short, wide and extremely average \u2013 giving Bairstow another gift of a boundary. 37th over: England 105-1 (Burns 77, Bairstow 7) Burns attempts another cover drive but this one he doesn\u2019t quite time it, and it bobbles straight to a fielder. A maiden from Joseph. 36th over: England 105-1 (Burns 77, Bairstow 7) England are now a sixth of the way to glory! 35th over: England 102-1 (Burns 76, Bairstow 5) Burns jabs his bat down onto Joseph\u2019s first delivery and has no idea where the ball goes after that, leading to a comedy bit of on-the-spot spinnage as he at tempts to track it down. Nothing wrong with a bit of spinnage, though, as Popeye fans will know. Later Burns drives smartly through the covers, Hetmyer stopping it well about a third of an inch from the rope. England run three, move into triple figures and earn a hearty ovation. 34th over: England 99-1 (Burns 73, Bairstow 5) Holder gets one to zig back into Bairstow and thump him in a thigh pad. The ball would obviously have cleared the stumps, though, so the appeal is brief. 33rd over: England 99-1 (Burns 73, Bairstow 5) Over drinks West Indies decide to bring in a short leg, and then Joseph\u2019s first ball stays low as Bairstow\u2019s bat swishes above it. A single later Burns slashes one over gully \u2013 not very far over him either \u2013 for four. \u201cPretty harsh of people to focus on the fact that Jennings keeps getting out in exactly the same way,\u201d sniffs Felix Wood. \u201cWhy can\u2019t they focus on all of the other ways he doesn\u2019t get out?\u201d 32nd over: England 94-1 (Burns 69, Bairstow 4) Holder\u2019s first ball bounces high over Burns\u2019 left shoulder, tempting him into an unadvisable attempted high cut. The ball flies past the bat and from there Burns retreats into his shell. Maiden. 31st over: England 94-1 (Burns 69, Bairstow 4) Bairstow gets off the mark with a boundary, flicked through midwicket and confirmed after a replay, the fielder just failing to flick it away before he slid into the rope. 30th over: England 90-1 (Burns 69, Bairstow 0) Having scored the runs and taken the catch, Holder comes on to bowl. \u201cWhile Jennings was in, the contrast between him and Burns was pretty horrible,\u201d cringes David Hindle. \u201cAre we back to \u2018not nearly good enough for test cricket!\u2019. If so, who comes in instead?\u201d Jennings is extraordinarily fallible, but it\u2019s not as if England haven\u2019t looked pretty hard for a decent alternative. 29th over: England 85-1 (Burns 65, Bairstow 0) Jennings didn\u2019t really look like he was playing within himself, he just looked in poor nick. Unlike the moment that did for him, which was a very solid nick. Bairstow\u2019s first ball rears up and he fends it away with his glove, but there\u2019s no short leg to snaffle it. For the first time in approximately forever, a wicket falls! Jennings gets a thick edge and it flies high to the tallest man on the field! 28th over: England 85-0 (Burns 65, Jennings 14) Burns deliberately cuts the ball between third slip and gully for four, a seriously ballsy shot in the circumstances, and then unzips another lovely cover drive with identical results. \u201cJust been having a conversation with our dachshund, Dakkers,\u201d writes Kim Thonger. \u201cHe wishes it to be known that he now self identifies as TransSpecies. He has experienced the sense of being in the wrong species\u2019 body and a desire to be a human, apparently a classic symptom of species dysphoria, for some time, and feels it is in everyone\u2019s interest that he should make this official declaration. He\u2019s also keen to know if Ed Smith might consider selecting him as an emergency specialist silly short leg for the Second Test? He\u2019s a useful No3 with a batting style very reminiscent of Harry Pilling.\u201d 27th over: England 77-0 (Burns 57, Jennings 14) Jennings tries to duck under a ball that never rises, and thumps ouchily into his upper arm. Jennings has faced 79 balls for his 14 runs; Burns has 57 from 83. \u201cThere\u2019s a very laissez-faire feel to today\u2019s play,\u201d notes Phil Withall. \u201cThe lack of urgency due to a large lead vs the lack of urgency due to a large lead. Going to be an interesting (not exciting) couple of days.\u201d 26th over: England 76-0 (Burns 56, Jennings 14) Another maiden from Roach to Jennings. England remain one short of matching their first-innings total. 25th over: England 76-0 (Burns 56, Jennings 14) Gabriel bowls full and straight and Burns flicks the ball away again, scoring the couple of runs he needed to complete his half-century. He dabs the next down the leg side, taking the in the circumstances rather questionable decision to run a risky second, and then drives to the rope again. It continues to look, in short, like a fine time to be a batter. John Starbuck meanwhile doesn\u2019t believe that the home side need to be unduly worried about their keeping situation: \u201cPresumably if Hope is injured, the West Indies could ask England if they could borrow one, seeing as we have so many.\u201d 24th over: England 68-0 (Burns 48, Jennings 14) A maiden from Roach, with Jennings only once required to bring bat to ball. 23rd over: England 68-0 (Burns 48, Jennings 14) Jennings faces a ball for the first time today, with Gabriel going over the wicket, the ball slanted across the batsman and occasionally swinging a shade away from him as well. Jennings leaves the first four deliveries before punching the next past point for three. England are now over 10% of the way to victory, an important psychological milestone (potentially). 22nd over: England 65-0 (Burns 48, Jennings 11) Roach\u2019s first ball is very full and very wide, and Burns goes to play at it before withdrawing his bat at the last. He attempts to drive the next, edges, and the ball flies perfectly between third slip and gully. It\u2019s the second time Burns has done precisely that in this innings, prompting West Indies to immediately add a fourth slip. It doesn\u2019t stop Burns driving, though, and he middles the next one, sending the ball hurtling through the covers for four more. 21st over: England 57-0 (Burns 40, Jennings 11) Hope regularly keeps wicket in ODIs, so should be familiar enough with the art of glovemanship. Gabriel bowls, and Burns leaves a couple, defends another, slashes at a wide one, bottom-edging into the ground, and clips the last off his pads, as he did so well yesterday, for one. Team news update: Shane Dowrich, bat-wielding hero of yesterday, is feeling a muscle strain and has not taken the field. Shai Hope will keep wicket in his stead. \u201cI actually feel ill,\u201d writes Peter Gibbs, as the players head out. \u201cMy heart is telling me \u2026 we can do this. My stomach is telling me \u2026 hide in the toilet.\u201d Jos Buttler has a chat with Sky. How big a bonus was the opening partnership, and their success batting to the close of play yesterday? A great lift. a great effort from those two guys having spent a lot of time in the field. it can be a tough task but I thought they played very well and we need more of the same today. He\u2019s asked to explain England\u2019s poor batting performance in the first innings. Strange goings-on. We lost all those wickets and were well below par. Yesterday Holder and Dowrich played really well, though we missed a few chances. There were good signs for us last night and we need to build on that today. We need to work out why that happened. Credit to the West Indies, they bowled very well, but we just weren\u2019t good enough to soak up that pressure and get a partnership going. We have to be much better than that. How do you approach batting in those circumstances, and decide whether to defend or attack? Either you try to dig in the two of you and ride it out for half an hour or an hour, or you can go on the positive side and almost hit bowlers off those lengths that you\u2019re finding difficult. Whatever way you do it you have to be brave and fully commit to that way. He\u2019s asked whether he as a senior player was involved in the decision to leave Stuart Broad out of the side: No I wasn\u2019t. The selectors and the captain go into that. But hindsight\u2019s great. It\u2019s a tough task, selecting a team. Batting has really been the major issue. Had we got runs on the board in our first innings we\u2019d be in a position to utilise the attack we picked for this game. Stuart\u2019s been great. I think that\u2019s one of the strengths of the side at hte minute. You talk about a squad, good harmony, people doing things for the team. Of course he\u2019ll be disappointed but he knows showing that doesn\u2019t help the team. He\u2019s been great. \u201cDAB ready, check. Headphones ready, check. Peanuts, check. Beer ready, check. Ginger wine and long bendy straw ready, check. Catheter ready, check. Right, let the hunkering down begin,\u201d says Damian Clarke. That sounds like the full hunkering-down kit. Plus ginger wine. I\u2019m not sure where ginger wine fits in. \u201cLooks like a crucial first three sessions of the day,\u201d suggests Gary Naylor. That\u2019s pretty much where we\u2019re at, though I\u2019d say the first session is the most crucial \u2013 and that will continue to be the case until it ends. Hello world! Test One, Day Four, and if England were at all right in their reading of this pitch this is the day when the surface will deteriorate, a couple of decent spinners would come in handy and batting will become bothersome. There was little sign of that yesterday, though, as for the 10th time in the history of Test cricket - and after a lunatic 18 wickets had fallen on day two - an entire day was played in which 300 runs were scored and not a single wicket was taken. England really should have taken a few yesterday only for their fielding to flibber at vital moments, but clearly this is a pitch on which batsmen can hunker down, stay in and score runs. Another 572, England\u2019s victory target, remains an outlandishly unlikely prospect, but where there\u2019s life there\u2019s hope - and there is rain forecast for tomorrow... Here\u2019s Vic Marks on yesterday\u2019s action: And here\u2019s Jos Buttler\u2019s take on the action so far: So welcome! Let\u2019s hunker down and see what happens, shall we?",

These, of course, are not ordinary circumstances. Newport had an FA Cup tie against Middlesbrough to take up their time and that left the 92nd-placed club in English football facing a blank weekend. To borrow an old line from Jasper Carrott, their best result for ages.</p> <p>Not that the supporters of this proud old club will find that particularly amusing when Notts are currently eight points off safety at the bottom of League Two and straying dangerously close to losing their title as the oldest club in the Football League.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/13/harry-kewell-notts-county-sacking-season\">Harry Kewell leaves Notts County amid flurry of Football League sackings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The history at Notts goes back to 1862 and, growing up in Nottingham, I know how proud they are of that status. My team was the other side of the River Trent \u2013 the one Dave McVay, the old Notts centre-half, described as \u201cthe evil slime\u201d \u2013 but it was quite common to go to Meadow Lane if Cloughie\u2019s boys were away. Nottingham, as a whole, has always been proud to have two league clubs separated by a few hundred yards and just because Jimmy Sirrel was only the second most famous manager in the city it didn\u2019t lessen his own achievements.</p> <p>The stories were legend about Sirrel licking the top of the sauce bottle clean during team dinners or travelling from his home in the village of Burton Joyce to use the communal bath. Or the time he fell asleep after having a shave, not realising he had nicked his neck, and the youth-team player who found him lying in a bloodied shirt ran into the office screaming: \u201cOh my God, Jimmy\u2019s dead!\u201d</p> <p>Sirrel led Notts from the depths of the old Fourth Division to the top tier, announcing their arrival on the opening weekend of the 1981-82 season by winning away against the champions, Aston Villa. Notts mattered. And I can imagine he would have wanted a light shone on the boardroom buffoonery that has brought them to this point, the narcissism of one man in particular, and what it tells us about modern-day football and the downfalls of social media. The lesson, in this case, being that football club owners should leave tweeting to those feathered little creatures in the sky.</p> <p>At the heart of it is Alan Hardy. Or \u201cBig Alan,\u201d as he likes to be known. Hardy bought Notts two years ago, has put a lot of money into the club as the successful boss of an interiors company, and is certainly an interesting character if you consider the rather astonishing story of him being caught speeding and apparently deciding that the laws of Britain\u2019s roads should not apply to him. \u201cI don\u2019t agree that speeding kills,\u201d he said, before pleading not guilty and asking for the case to go to a trial. \u201cInappropriate speeding kills and there is a marked difference.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Nottingham\u2019s magistrates disagreed, having heard he was driving his BMW at 77mph in a 40mph zone and, according to the BBC, already had 11 points on his licence. Hardy did at least change his plea to guilty but was so adamant he should be let off a ban he lodged an immediate appeal. That failed, too. \u201cI owed it to my business and my family to put my case forward,\u201d Hardy, disqualified for three months, explained outside court.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cadea2bd2a41d801ded7290a27dfb9814bc9e3a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cadea2bd2a41d801ded7290a27dfb9814bc9e3a3/0_246_5217_3130/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neal Ardley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neal Ardley, who left AFC Wimbledon shortly before becoming Notts County\u2019s manager, shows the strain last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Williamson - AMA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the more intriguing developments I can reveal at Notts is that seven members of non-football staff were suspended last year, leading to four losing their jobs, during an internal dispute involving the discovery of two Whatsapp groups in which they shared their views of, among other things, the club\u2019s owner. Let\u2019s assume they were not planning to nominate him for Boss of the Year. Of the three who were kept on, two have subsequently left. Notts have declined to comment.</p> <p>Hardy appears to be very fond of publicity, takes advice from Peter Ridsdale \u2013 \u201cJust learnt more in the last hour than in the last 12 months!\u201d he tweeted after one audience with the former Leeds supremo \u2013 and tends to opts for the scattergun as his form of Twitter artillery, whether it be messaging the editor of the <em>Nottingham Evening Post</em> to point out he expected to see Notts, not Forest, on the following day\u2019s back page, or his recent jousting with the followers of Mansfield Town, Nottinghamshire\u2019s third professional club.</p> <p>One wanted to know his views about the progress of Mansfield under the ownership of John and Carolyn Radford. \u201cOne swallow doesn\u2019t make a summer,\u201d Hardy responded. \u201cHow\u2019s your 20,000 seat stadium?\u201d Mansfield, with their 9,186-capacity Field Mill, were third in League Two at the time. To another fan, Hardy followed up with: \u201cLet\u2019s compare league positions in three years, sunshine.\u201d</p> <p>More relevant to this story, however, is the way he has never been afraid to chip away at a club that, in terms of age, is three years their junior. Hardy, Nottingham born and bred, made a great play of his local roots, describing Notts as \u201cthe true club of the community in this region\u201d (Forest have Greek owners), rowed with Forest\u2019s fans on Twitter and promised it would get \u201cvery spicy\u201d when they were in the same league. Notts were on the up, spending time last season on top of League Two, and Hardy made all sorts of subtle and not-so-subtle barbs at the expense of their neighbours.</p> <p>The problem for Notts was this was a risky strategy when one of the reasons they were doing so well was because of two Forest loanees, Jorge Grant, an attacking midfielder, had scored 16 goals before the turn of the year. Ryan Yates, another Forest academy graduate, was possibly even more impressive. And, unfortunately for Hardy, there are only so many times you can bite the hand that feeds you.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Before the start of the season, Hardy described promotion as a 'dead cert'. Instead Kevin Nolan was sacked in August. Harry Kewell lasted 73 days. Neal Ardley was appointed and has won one of his first 10 games</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He found that out the hard way last January when Scunthorpe, of League One, proposed an alternative loan deal to give Yates experience of a higher division. Forest approved the switch, concluding that Hardy no longer deserved preferential treatment, and the rest is history.</p> <p>From second in the league, six points clear of third, Notts fell back to fifth and lost to Coventry City in the play-offs (Coventry\u2019s players, it later transpired, had used as motivation Hardy\u2019s pre-match comments about arranging buses to Wembley and the rumour that he already had celebratory T-shirts printed).</p> <p>Hardy did not seem to appreciate that Forest had turned down separate approaches for Grant. He was \u201cfurious\u201d about Yates, he announced on BBC Radio Nottingham, and blamed \u201cnon-footballing people\u201d. Diplomatic relations were off.</p> <p>After that, it has been a spectacular unravelling to find Notts in a position where those famous black and white stripes, as the club that gave Juventus their colours, might be heading for the National League.</p> <p>Before the start of the season, Hardy described promotion as a \u201cdead cert\u201d. Instead, Notts did not win any of their first five league fixtures and the manager, Kevin Nolan, was sacked on 26 August. All of which was a bit awkward given that Hardy had previously hailed Nolan as a \u201cfuture England manager\u201d and not helped by Paul Mace, another Notts director, claiming in the <em>Nottingham Evening Post </em>it was a unanimous boardroom decision.</p> <p>Unanimous? \u201cThat is simply not true,\u201d another director, Jon Enever, responded on Twitter. Enever felt so strongly about it he walked out and the vice-chairman Darren Fletcher quit a short time later. Fletcher had been appointed to a director of football-type role in June, with \u201cresponsibility to oversee the football department\u201d, presumably when he was not being a television commentator for BT Sport.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/26/kevin-nolan-sacked-by-notts-county-with-winless-club-bottom-of-league-two\">Kevin Nolan sacked by Notts County with winless club bottom of League Two</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a moment of comedy gold, he was asked on Twitter recently (yes, Twitter again) what he thought of Hardy\u2019s tweeting habits. \u201cNo idea mate,\u201d Fletcher replied. \u201cBeen blocked by him for a while.\u201d</p> <p>If, to continue the Nottingham theme, all this sounds like the makings of a Sleaford Mods song \u2014 \u201cBeen Blocked by Alan\u201d (a feeling, I must admit, I am half-expecting this weekend) \u2013 the truth is it barely scratches the surface of why the club\u2019s economics were described by Hardy recently as \u201cunsustainable\u201d and why it has been commented behind the scenes that if there was ever a lesson to be learned about how not to run a football club this was it.</p> <p>Harry Kewell, Nolan\u2019s replacement, lasted 73 days before he, too, was sacked. Nolan was sounded out to see whether he would like to go back but nothing came of it and Neal Ardley was appointed instead. Ardley, who had just left his job at AFC Wimbledon, has won one of his first 10 games. The \u201cdead certs\u201d have conceded 59 goals from 29 games, with a \u00a33m wage bill and, until recently, 38 players on their books. Hardy has turned off the scoreboard to save money for transfers and, if all this was not galling enough for their supporters, just consider who might become the oldest Football League club by default.</p> <p>Stoke City are commonly described as next in line but even the club\u2019s own website admits \u201cmany details remain sketchy\u201d about their formation, purportedly in 1863, and when the historian Wade Martin looked into it for his book, <em>A Potter\u2019s Tale</em>, he could find no evidence. Stoke\u2019s first recorded match was 1868 and, whatever the truth of their origins, they were liquidated in 1908 and did not return to the Football League for 11 years. All of which means the club potentially taking the title away from Notts would be \u2026 Nottingham Forest, founded in 1865. The evil slime, indeed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>What does all this tell us? Firstly, don\u2019t burn bridges with a club that is trying to do you a favour. Forest have refused to be drawn into a public row but two things have become noticeable. First, their usual pre-season friendly at Meadow Lane never happened last summer \u2013 Notts hosted Leicester and Derby instead, with Hardy welcoming the \u201ctwo biggest football clubs in the East Midlands\u201d \u2013 and, secondly, Forest now loan players to Mansfield in what has been described as the beginning of a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d. One of them is Tyler Walker, son of Des, who has 19 goals. Another is the aforementioned Jorge Grant. Mansfield could go up because of it.</p> <p>In different circumstances, these players could have been turning out for Notts, maybe even in League One. But they are not and I wonder whether, deep down, Hardy knows it didn\u2019t have to be this way. Might he admit, knowing what he does now, that he has been his own worst enemy?</p> <p>The only certainty is that Notts have 17 games to save themselves and prevent 157 years of history making way for non-league status.</p> <p>I hope they can make it, but even the most optimistic Notts fan would have to admit it is looking bleak. The oldest club in the Football League? It\u2019s Notts County, not Stoke, not Forest, not anybody else, and it will be a sad day, indeed, if that ever changes.</p> <h2>A sorry failure</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67d38e7076f857e74ee1d7741938a1eeaba44583\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67d38e7076f857e74ee1d7741938a1eeaba44583/0_105_2464_1478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Sampson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Sampson during his time in charge of England Women.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dennis Grombkowski/Bongarts/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mark Sampson made a point of thanking Baroness Campbell for her \u201cintegrity and care\u201d during a mea culpa in the Times, followed up with another apology on the League Managers Association website, that felt suspiciously like a man trying to find his way back into the sport.</p> <p>Campbell is the FA\u2019s director of women\u2019s football and it sounds like she has been a fine support for the man who, better late than never, now admits he did make racial remarks to two of his players and is perhaps hoping we have all forgotten he did previously deny it all.</p> <p>An interesting position for Campbell to take, though, when it might have been expected her attention would be more with the people who were on the wrong end of those \u201cjokes\u201d from the then England Women\u2019s manager and who have had to go through the very public ordeal of three investigations, a parliamentary hearing and what the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association has described, with justification, as some kind of cover-up.</p> <p>I note that the very sympathetic Campbell also made sure to praise the rest of the England team for the way they handled the fall-out. Sampson wanted to thank Campbell \u201cfor demonstrating that integrity and care can still be shown in the most difficult of circumstances\u201d.</p> <p>At which point you might be wondering what level of support such an important figure in the women\u2019s sport has offered to the people, lest it be forgotten, who really deserved her time?</p> <p>Has she been a rock for the mixed-race player, Drew Spence, who was asked by Sampson in front of her new team-mates on her first England camp how many times she had been arrested and \u2013 clearly just a coincidence \u2013 has never been picked since it became clear she didn\u2019t like what he was insinuating?</p> <p>Has Campbell made it her business to support Eni Aluko, who was told by Sampson to make sure her Nigerian relatives did not bring the Ebola virus to a game at Wembley? That, after all, is what you would expect from someone in Campbell\u2019s position at the FA, once named among the 100 most powerful women in the United Kingdom, isn\u2019t it? Has she contacted Aluko?</p> <p>Disappointingly, she and the FA have declined to respond to all those questions \u2013 but I hope the answer is yes. Otherwise, you might reasonably conclude: a) the FA still has its priorities badly blurred and b) maybe it should be Baroness Campbell apologising, as well as the bloke who could have saved everyone a lot of hassle if he had admitted it in the first place.</p>",

The \u201cdead certs\u201d have conceded 59 goals from 29 games, with a \u00a33m wage bill and, until recently, 38 players on their books. Hardy has turned off the scoreboard to save money for transfers and, if all this was not galling enough for their supporters, just consider who might become the oldest Football League club by default. Stoke City are commonly described as next in line but even the club\u2019s own website admits \u201cmany details remain sketchy\u201d about their formation, purportedly in 1863, and when the historian Wade Martin looked into it for his book, A Potter\u2019s Tale, he could find no evidence. Stoke\u2019s first recorded match was 1868 and, whatever the truth of their origins, they were liquidated in 1908 and did not return to the Football League for 11 years. All of which means the club potentially taking the title away from Notts would be \u2026 Nottingham Forest, founded in 1865. The evil slime, indeed. What does all this tell us? Firstly, don\u2019t burn bridges with a club that is trying to do you a favour. Forest have refused to be drawn into a public row but two things have become noticeable. First, their usual pre-season friendly at Meadow Lane never happened last summer \u2013 Notts hosted Leicester and Derby instead, with Hardy welcoming the \u201ctwo biggest football clubs in the East Midlands\u201d \u2013 and, secondly, Forest now loan players to Mansfield in what has been described as the beginning of a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d. One of them is Tyler Walker, son of Des, who has 19 goals. Another is the aforementioned Jorge Grant. Mansfield could go up because of it. In different circumstances, these players could have been turning out for Notts, maybe even in League One. But they are not and I wonder whether, deep down, Hardy knows it didn\u2019t have to be this way. Might he admit, knowing what he does now, that he has been his own worst enemy? The only certainty is that Notts have 17 games to save themselves and prevent 157 years of history making way for non-league status. I hope they can make it, but even the most optimistic Notts fan would have to admit it is looking bleak. The oldest club in the Football League? It\u2019s Notts County, not Stoke, not Forest, not anybody else, and it will be a sad day, indeed, if that ever changes. A sorry failure Mark Sampson made a point of thanking Baroness Campbell for her \u201cintegrity and care\u201d during a mea culpa in the Times, followed up with another apology on the League Managers Association website, that felt suspiciously like a man trying to find his way back into the sport. Campbell is the FA\u2019s director of women\u2019s football and it sounds like she has been a fine support for the man who, better late than never, now admits he did make racial remarks to two of his players and is perhaps hoping we have all forgotten he did previously deny it all. An interesting position for Campbell to take, though, when it might have been expected her attention would be more with the people who were on the wrong end of those \u201cjokes\u201d from the then England Women\u2019s manager and who have had to go through the very public ordeal of three investigations, a parliamentary hearing and what the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association has described, with justification, as some kind of cover-up. I note that the very sympathetic Campbell also made sure to praise the rest of the England team for the way they handled the fall-out. Sampson wanted to thank Campbell \u201cfor demonstrating that integrity and care can still be shown in the most difficult of circumstances\u201d. At which point you might be wondering what level of support such an important figure in the women\u2019s sport has offered to the people, lest it be forgotten, who really deserved her time? Has she been a rock for the mixed-race player, Drew Spence, who was asked by Sampson in front of her new team-mates on her first England camp how many times she had been arrested and \u2013 clearly just a coincidence \u2013 has never been picked since it became clear she didn\u2019t like what he was insinuating? Has Campbell made it her business to support Eni Aluko, who was told by Sampson to make sure her Nigerian relatives did not bring the Ebola virus to a game at Wembley? That, after all, is what you would expect from someone in Campbell\u2019s position at the FA, once named among the 100 most powerful women in the United Kingdom, isn\u2019t it? Has she contacted Aluko? Disappointingly, she and the FA have declined to respond to all those questions \u2013 but I hope the answer is yes. Otherwise, you might reasonably conclude: a) the FA still has its priorities badly blurred and b) maybe it should be Baroness Campbell apologising, as well as the bloke who could have saved everyone a lot of hassle if he had admitted it in the first place.",

The Lions have failed to win either of their past two, losing against Blackburn and drawing with Middlesbrough. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel we are in a position where we have turned the season around,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a relatively good first few weeks then we had a spell where every error we made, the ball went in the goal. I have never really had that before when I have been in charge. This year has been the first time and we had a dip in individual players not being at their best. Certainly had more injuries than we have ever had. It has culminated in us not winning as many games as we should have.</p> <p>\u201cCoupled with the number of late goals we have let in, it has put us in a position we are not used to being in, the lower half of the division. It has been a good learning curve. Since Christmas we took 10 points in five league games, beat Hull and the league game we lost was at Blackburn in the last minute. That was a frustrating one. We have got a long way to go to get back to our best which we showed at the end of last season but we are certainly showing signs of improvement, and that brings momentum and confidence.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81d29fbf427ac457ab9ac76e9ad9c09a7d8c0dd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81d29fbf427ac457ab9ac76e9ad9c09a7d8c0dd8/0_302_5652_3391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neil Harris\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neil Harris poses for Guardian photographer Tom Jenkins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-26T17:14:17.842Z\">at 5.14pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c4c7f37e4b051f537968c30\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-26T16:36:28.158Z\">4.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Early team news ...</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Millwall manager Neil Harris must plan without injured strikers Tom Bradshaw and Tom Elliott, goalkeeper Ben Amos and right-back Conor McLaughlin.

      "bodyText": "Millwall are through to the fifth round and here\u2019s how they got there. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! It\u2019s all over and Millwall are through to the fifth round after coming from behind twice to beat a dreadful Everton side with three set-piece goals. For the fifth time in a succession they\u2019ve beaten Premier League opposition at the Den and despite scoring a controversial equaliser to make it 2-2 are well worth their win. Everton had three shots on target during the 90 minutes and their defending at free-kicks and corners was little short of risible. 90+6 min: Millwall substitution: Alex Pearce on for Lee Gregory. Millwall win it at the death as Everton fail to defend yet another set piece. Shaun Williams played the ball into the mixer from the right touchline, Hutchinson got the knockdown and Murray Wallace sweeps home from a few yards out. 90+3 min: Now it\u2019s Everton\u2019s turn to defend as Millwall launch a late assault and win a free-kick wide on the right for a Digne foul on Morison. 90+2 min: Millwall win a throw-in deep in Everton territory, which Leonard takes long. Everton clear and Richarlison gallops off on the counter-attack. Millwall recover and clear the ball, but Everton continue to ramp up the pressure. Sigurdsson takes a shot from distance and Jordan Archer saves comfortably. 90 min: Kurt Zouma dispossesses Ryan Leponard with a wonderful sliding tackle on the edge of his own penalty area. It was perfectly timed, if a little risky given the atrocious conditions. 88 min: Millwall substitution from a minute or two ago: Aiden O\u2019Brien off, Jiri Skalak on. Millwall substitution just now: Shane Ferguson off, Steve Morison on. 85 min: Fun and games on the sideline, where Everton boss Marco Silva is appealing to the referee\u2019s assistant to rule out the goal because he\u2019s just seen the handball on the big screen in the corner of the ground. He\u2019s calling for VAR of a kind, even though it is only being used in FA Cup ties played at Premier League grounds this weekend. In the adjacent technical area, Neil Harris is gesticulating furiously at whoever is in charge of the screen, telling them to stop showing replays of the goal. 81 min: some housekeeping: Idrissa Gueye and Cenk Tosun were both booked for protesting too much in the wake of that second Millwall equaliser. Everton may well complain about that handball if they draw or lose this game, but they only have themselves to blame really. Their defending at set-pieces has been risible during this game and one can\u2019t help but feel that if Millwall were able to get the ball into the box more often they\u2019d be ahead in this game. 78 min: That goal could scarcely have been more scrappy, but it shouldn\u2019t have counted. Following protests from several Everton players, the referee consulted with his assistant before allowing the goal to stand. It\u2019s difficult to blame him for getting the decision wrong, as the penalty area was packed full of bodies and his view may well have been obstructed. Everton substitution: Theo Walcott on for Ademola Lookman. Millwall equalise from a set-piece, which Everton have proved utterly hopeless at defending throughout this game. The free-kick was needless and Ferguson sent the ball into the penalty area. Following a scramble in which Jake Cooper handled the ball, he eventually guided it home. Murray Wallace took a shot from close range that was saved by Pickford, but the ball broke to Cooper who controlled it with his hand before steering it home. 74 min: Digne barges into Romeo down by the corner flag to concede a free-kick. Everton retake the lead. From the edge of the penalty area, Gylfi Sigurdsson plays a neat through-ball into the path of Cenk Tosun, who gets in behind the Millwall defence to dispatch the ball beyond Jordan Archer with a scuffed shot. 70 min: Andre Gomes plays a crossfield ball towards Lucas Digne on the left touchline, but Aiden O\u2019Brien tracks back to prevent the Everton left-back from taking possession. 68 min: Everton win a throw-in deep in Millwall territory after good play from Lookman and Coleman, who are combining well down that right flank. 67 min: Murray Wallace picks up the first booking of the game for a tug on Ademola Lookman. 67 min: Millwall corner. Shane Ferguson curls the ball towards the near post, where Lucas Digne heads clear. 65 min: Everton substitution: Cenk Tosun on for Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who has spent the last 65 minutes in the pockets of Millwall central defenders Shaun Hutchinson and Jake Cooper. It\u2019s been a very disappointing performance from the young player trying to stake his claim to be Everton\u2019s main striker. 63 min: Everton win a corner, which Gylfi Sigurdsson takes. He aims for Kurt Zouma, but Ryan Leonard heads clear. Ryan Tunnicliffe completes the clear-up, running the ball out of defence. 63 min: Ryan Leonard attempts a shot from distance, but sends his effort high over the bar before turning away from goal and smiling sheepishly. 61 min: At the risk of labouring the point, the downpour here is little short of biblical. It\u2019s been raining since well before kick-off and little puddles are starting to form on the pitch. 60 min: Richarlison squares the ball for Lookman, who is unmarked in the penalty area. A poor first touch from the striker allows Millwall to scramble the ball clear. 58 min: Everton win a free-kick wide on the right. Gylfi Sigurdsson sends a dangerous cross fizzing into the penalty area, trying to find Calvert-Lewin. Shaun Hutchinson gets goal;side of the striker and Ryan Tunnicliffe hacks clear. 57 min: Jake Cooper boots the ball forward and in the penalty area, Ryan Leonard heads the ball backwards into the path of Lee Gregory. He shoots wide. 53 min: Everton corner, which Gylfi Sigurdsson takes. Millwall clear, while another foul on an Everton player - Kurt Zouma was having his shirt pulled by Jake Cooper - in the penalty area at a set-piece goes unpunished and possibly unnoticed by the referee, Michael Oliver. 52 min: A promising Everton move breaks down when Ademola Lookman fails to find him with a pass into the Millwall penalty area. It continues to lash down with rain and the pitch is increasingly sodden. 49 min: Romeo gets a good cross into the Everton box, which beats Jordan Pickford. Murray Wallace stoops to try to head home from the edge of the six-yard box, but his effort is blocked. Millwall fans appeal for a penalty for hand-ball off the defender, but none is forthcoming. Replays show Michael Oliver was correct to ignore their pleas. 48 min: Millwall win a throw-in deep in Everton teritory, which Romeo takes. He receives the ball back and attempts to send a cross into the Everton box, but Sigurdsson blocks. 47 min: Zouma gets an early touch and tries to release Digne down the left flank. He touches the ball inside to Richarlison, who is dispossessed by Mahlon Romeo. 46 min: Everton get the ball rolling after an abysmal first half display, during which they scored a fairly lucky goal with their only shot on target. They were first out for the second half and were kept waiting by Millwall, who joined them a couple of minutes later. There\u2019s a change in the Everton line-up, with Kurt Zouma coming on for Yerry Mina, who picked up a knock in the first half. The players go in for the break after 43 minutes of the most dreadful football entertainment you\u2019ll ever see. And three that were quite exciting. The conditions - it\u2019s windy and pouring with rain \u2013 haven\u2019t helped, but the game sparked into life with two minutes of the half remaining when Richarlison put Everton ahead with a soft goal from distance. A couple of minutes later, Lee Gregory restored parity with a fine header. Game on!!! Lee Gregory equalise almost immediately from a set-piece. A long diagonal ball from deep is sent to the edge of the Everton box. Jake Cooper gets to it and heads it into the mixer, where Lee Gregory out-jumps Lucas Digne to send a looping header over Jordan Pickford and into the net. 45 min: Jordan Archer was furious with Shaun Hutchinson in the wake of that goal, accusing the centre-half of ducking out of the way of Richarlison\u2019s shot. That seems a rather harsh assessment of events and methinks the goalkeeper may have been trying to deflect blame away from his own glaring error. He had a clear sight of the ball and should have saved comfortably. Oh dear. Richarlison fires Everton ahead with a shot from outside the box that took a deflection off Shaun Hutchinson. The ball bounced in front of the diving Jordan Archer, who misjudges the flight and allows it to squirm under his body. 41 min: Murray Wallace switches play from left wing to right for Millwall, who are then forced on the retreat and back into their own half. 39 min: Shane Ferguson wins a free-kick not too far inside the Everton half after backing into Ademola Lookman. The ball\u2019s floated towards the edge of the Everton penalty area, where the visitors clear. 37 min: Jordan Archer makes a mess of trying to clear a back-pass and sends the ball looping up in the air. It drops at the feet of Gylfi Sigurdsson just outside the Millwall penalty area,but rather than hit it first time, the Icelandic international dithers over his shot and a decent chance goes to waste. 36 min: Idrissa Gueye attempts to switch play out to the left wing, where Lucas Digne had made a good run up the touchline. The Senegal international overhits his pass and the ball sails out of play. 33 min: Coleman and Ferguson contest a high ball and the Millwall winger comes off second best. There\u2019s not a lot happening in this game, but I imagine Neil Harris will be delighted with the way things are going at the moment. His team are getting in the faces of their Everton counterparts and not allowing them to dictate the play. 28 min: Now Richarlison goes down hurt after Shaun Hutchinson clatters into him while running across to head a bouncing ball the Brazilian was trying to control on the touchline into the stand. The Millwall defender helps Richarlison to his feet and he hobbles gingerly back into battle. 27 min: Mina is passed fit to continue and takes an age to tie his boot before resuming play. Millwall\u2019s fans boo him accordingly for time-wasting. 24 min: It\u2019s been a scrappy game so far, with little in the way of chances to report. Everton are clearly the better side, but Millwall have had the best chance in that header Jake Cooper put wide. There\u2019s a break in play as Yerry Mina receives treatment for an injury he sustained in a coming-together with Lee Gregory. He\u2019ll catch his death of cold sitting on that wet grass. 22 min: Shane Ferguson crosses into the Everton penalty area from the left channel, but there\u2019s too many bodies there for Lee Gregory to get a sniff. The ball is headed clear. 20 min: Everton win a throw-in deep in Millwall territory after good link-up play between Lookman and Coleman. Nothing comes of it. 18 min: Gomes plays the ball out wide to Digne on the left touchline. He plays it on to Richarlison, who sends a good cross towards the far post. With Lookman running to the near one, Millwall goalkeeper Jordan Archer watches as the ball goes out of play. 17 min: The ball skids out for a goal kick after Richarlison tries to play in Ademola Lookman. Romeo upended Richarlison with a late tackle as he put in the cross and is lucky to avoid a booking. He gets a talking-to from Michael Oliver, but no yellow card. 15 min: Rain continues to hammer down as this scrappy game tries to find a rhythm. Millwall right-back Mahlon Romeo may be able to help out in that department, seeing as his dad is Jazzy B from Soul II Soul. 12 min: Millwall win a free-kick, wide on the right. The ball is lofted towards the far post, where Shaun Hutchinson heads it across the face of goal. Lucas Digne heads clear before anyone in a Millwall shirt can steer the ball goalwards. 9 min: While players in earlier games today wore black armbands to pay tribute to the missing (presumed dead) Cardiff City striker Emiliano Sala, the players at the Den are not doing so. It seems that Sala\u2019s family got in touch with the FA to ask that the tributes be put on hold, as they remain hopeful that he is still alive. 8 min: A great chance goes a begging for Millwall, as Jake Cooper gets on the end of a Shane Ferguson free-kick from deep, only to steer his header wide of the upright. He should have scored. 6 min: Replays suggest that Ryan Leonard was lucky to get away with a foul on Michael Keane as Lucas Diugne took that corner for Everton. The midfielder had his arm around the Everton defender\u2019s neck as the ball sailed into the penalty area, preventing him from jumping. If Michael Oliver had spotted him, he would surely have blown for a spot-kick. 5 min: Everton win a corner, which Lucas Digne sends curling away from the six-yard box. Millwall break on the counter-attack with Ryan Leonard on the ball. 3 min: For Everton, Ademola Lookman curls in a cross from the right flank. Dominic Calvert-Lewin is unable to control his header. 3 min: Rain pours down as Shaun Hutchinson is penalised for a foul on Idrissa Gueye in midfield. 2 min: Shane Ferguson loses the ball in midfield, allowing Everton to take possession and try to build an attack. 1 min: Millwall get an early cross into the Everton box, which Jordan Pickford claims comfortably. 1 min: Millwall kick off. Their players line-up wearing navy shirts with white collars, white shorts and blue socks. Everton\u2019s players wear white shirts, navy blue shorts and white socks. Referee Michael Oliver is a vision in cerise, in case you\u2019re interested. Not long now: \u201cTHIS IS THE LIONS\u2019 DEN\u201d reads the sign over the cramped tunnel as the teams march out to do battle. Kick-off is just moments away. Prediction time: We haven\u2019t had much in the way of upsets so far today, unless you count Accrington manager John Coleman, who was very upset indeed in the wake of his side\u2019s defeat at the hands of Derby County. Coleman embarked on a spectacularly bitter post-match rant against referee Jon Moss, who he blamed for Accrington\u2019s defeat. I quite fancy Millwall to do a number on Everton this evening, so I\u2019ll plump for Millwall 3-1 Everton. Millwall: Archer, Romeo, Hutchinson, Cooper, Murray Wallace, O\u2019Brien, Tunnicliffe, Leonard, Williams, Ferguson, Gregory. Subs: Meredith, Pearce, Martin, Morison, Skalak, Hanson, Alexander. Everton: Pickford, Coleman, Keane, Mina, Digne, Andre Gomes, Gueye, Lookman, Sigurdsson, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin. Subs: Baines, Zouma, Walcott, Tosun, Bernard, Stekelenburg, Davies. Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland) Neil Harris speaks: Talking in the build-up to the game, Millwall\u2019s manager said he didn\u2019t think his team had achieved the kind of consistency he\u2019d like, despite winning four games (three league and one FA Cup) since after Christmas. The Lions have failed to win either of their past two, losing against Blackburn and drawing with Middlesbrough. \u201cI don\u2019t feel we are in a position where we have turned the season around,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a relatively good first few weeks then we had a spell where every error we made, the ball went in the goal. I have never really had that before when I have been in charge. This year has been the first time and we had a dip in individual players not being at their best. Certainly had more injuries than we have ever had. It has culminated in us not winning as many games as we should have. \u201cCoupled with the number of late goals we have let in, it has put us in a position we are not used to being in, the lower half of the division. It has been a good learning curve. Since Christmas we took 10 points in five league games, beat Hull and the league game we lost was at Blackburn in the last minute. That was a frustrating one. We have got a long way to go to get back to our best which we showed at the end of last season but we are certainly showing signs of improvement, and that brings momentum and confidence.\u201d Millwall manager Neil Harris must plan without injured strikers Tom Bradshaw and Tom Elliott, goalkeeper Ben Amos and right-back Conor McLaughlin. New signing Ben Marshall, in on loan from Norwich City, is cup-tied. Everton manager Silva is comparatively untroubled by injury concerns and is only missing Phil Jagielka, who has played just twice so far this season and is out with a muscle injury. Following his side\u2019s defeat at the hands of Southampton last weekend, Silva may well ring the changes. The Den is the setting for one of the fourth round\u2019s more intriguing ties, with Championship strugglers Millwall entertaining Premier League under-achievers Everton in the first meeting between the sides in any competition since they met in the third round of the FA Cup in 2005-06, which was won by today\u2019s visitors. Millwall saw off Hull City to earn their berth in this round, while Everton beat League Two leaders Lincoln City by the odd goal of three. Kick-off under the lights in south London is at 5.30pm (GMT), but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.",

      "body": "<p>It would seem that not only are high-profile lawsuits between celebrities and assistants becoming more common, increasingly they feature female stars. In 2013, Lady Gaga labelled her former personal assistant Jennifer O\u2019Neill a \u201chood rat who is suing me for money she didn\u2019t earn\u201d in a case eventually settled out of court. Mariah Carey is suing Lianna Azarian for $3m, alleging that Azarian filmed her in order to blackmail her. Azarian is <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6604017/Mariah-Careys-former-assistant-sues-singer-battery-racial-discrimination.html\" title=\"\">countersuing</a>, alleging that Carey\u2019s former manager, among other things, urinated on her while the singer watched (nice!). And so it goes on. </p> <p>Aside from lawsuits, the general rule seems to be that, somewhere along the line, the celebrity boss gets denounced for being a diva. It\u2019s as though, when things go wrong, the power imbalance between employer and employee is redeployed as a powerful PR weapon.</p> <p>It helps that the public has been \u201cgroomed\u201d to accept the idea of celebrities as divas, mainly because so many of the spoiled twerps are. Who hasn\u2019t heard of Carey insisting on kittens to pet backstage, or declaring that she doesn\u2019t \u201cdo stairs\u201d? The recent <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81035279\" title=\"\">Netflix documentary</a> on the Fyre festival debacle is a salutary lesson in what happens when ordinary, everyday Instagrammers \u201cgo diva\u201d.</p> <p>However, \u201cdiva\u201d isn\u2019t always a women-only deal, even though, apart from some gay men, it\u2019s generally famous females who get saddled with the demanding, high-maintenance \u201cdiva\u201d label, which is then easily believed and hard to shake off. By contrast, it seems to take many years and incidents (sometimes real ugliness) before men get branded divas. Johnny Depp was firing the remains of the writer Hunter S Thompson from a cannon (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/01/johnny-depp-spent-3m-blasting-hunter-s-thompson-ashes-from-cannon-ex-managers-claim\" title=\"\">estimated cost: $3m</a>) before people started questioning his \u201clifestyle choices\u201d.</p> <p>In some ways, bring it on \u2013 who doesn\u2019t thrill to hear of a celebrity monster behaving like a total fright? One day, I pray, an assistant with a sense of humour will sue a celebrity for not being <em>enough</em> of a diva (\u201cThey were too down to earth and reasonable \u2013 I suffered boredom injuries\u201d). What isn\u2019t funny, what makes the issue dark, is the distinct male/female diva divide and what that suggests.</p> <p>Too often, the diva tag comes across as just another way of deriding and undermining successful, powerful women who happen to work in the entertainment industry. A case of if you can\u2019t get away with labelling them a slut, brand them a diva. A similar dynamic operates in normal workspaces, where forceful men are considered dynamic and commanding, while forceful women are condemned as strident ball-breakers. So all power to the female diva \u2013 as long as people remember that often all it means is that a woman is powerful enough to make demands and determined enough to get them met.</p> <h2>Thank you for the music, Bros, but a TV career would be more entertaining</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"271cf3c3754c075ccee4a99de8f7e6adc658bcb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/271cf3c3754c075ccee4a99de8f7e6adc658bcb1/0_38_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt and Luke Goss: \u2018It would take a heart of stone not to wish the twins all the best with their comeback.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt and Luke Goss: \u2018It would take a heart of stone not to wish the twins all the best with their comeback.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nice to see Matt and Luke Goss\u2019s continued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/25/bros-without-the-cameras-there-would-have-been-blood\" title=\"\">good humour</a> regarding the reaction to the Bros documentary <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/09/bros-after-the-screaming-stops-review\" title=\"\">After the Screaming Stops</a></em>. Hilarious one minute \u2013 never before in pop-cultural history have two middle-aged men mused so intensely about conkers \u2013 full of pathos the next, the documentary was a blast. It would take a heart of stone not to wish the twins all the best with their comeback.</p> <p>Just one thing \u2013 does it have to involve music? Bros always had a disconcerting image: comprised almost entirely of bandanas and quiffs, they resembled a double-headed Tintin mutant. However, it was their music that really stunk up the place. Bros made Jive Bunny sound like the Velvet Underground. Judging by the documentary, said songs have not improved; if anything, they\u2019ve degraded further, like pop socks left hanging, forgotten, on a washing line since 1988.</p> <p>I\u2019m not being a musical snob \u2013 I\u2019m just begging Bros not to make any new music. The odd reunion show would be fine \u2013 if we really can\u2019t talk them out of it \u2013 but perhaps best to stop there. In my opinion, Bros didn\u2019t make good music. However, they did make incredible television. The road ahead seems clear.</p> <h2>Sorry, Meghan, but this is a part you\u2019ll have to play for ever</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"710d57c91af9c4135723112511b57bf5f7464e46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/710d57c91af9c4135723112511b57bf5f7464e46/0_0_2782_1670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex: \u2018Her toughest role so far.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Duke and Duchess of Sussex: \u2018Her toughest role so far.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Grover/Daily Telegraph/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>S<em>uits</em>, the US legal drama that starred Meghan Markle, now Duchess of Sussex, is to be <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/suits-renewed-season-9-final-season-1203115670/\" title=\"\">axed</a>. I watched this show (all the series, from the start) long before she showed up with Prince Harry. Her character, Rachel, pursued her legal ambitions while romantically tussling with the fake but brilliant Mike. It was surreal to see someone who\u2019d had an absurdly complicated on-screen relationship with Mike turn up in real life to embark on an absurdly complicated relationship with sections of the British press.</p> <p>For me, the biggest thrill of the royal wedding was seeing cast members of <em>Suits</em> squashed into pews, their faces suggesting that they didn\u2019t realise that they\u2019d signed up for the St George\u2019s Chapel cheap seats.</p> <p><em>Suits</em> has since played an underlying but pivotal role in the often preposterously nasty treatment of the duchess. While early coverage of the couple was cloying, the recent negativity directed at her has been nightmarish. Endless reports of spats with Kate, Duchess of Cambridge. Overpriced clothes. Holding her bump too much. Being American. Being too enthusiastic during public appearances. To the Tower with her!</p> <p>Nice work, all those joining in; hounding a pregnant woman \u2013 very classy. At least, as Rachel, Meghan only had Mike to deal with. Now, she has a vocal section of humanity denigrating her every move. Which is where <em>Suits</em> comes in.

      "bodyText": "It would seem that not only are high-profile lawsuits between celebrities and assistants becoming more common, increasingly they feature female stars. In 2013, Lady Gaga labelled her former personal assistant Jennifer O\u2019Neill a \u201chood rat who is suing me for money she didn\u2019t earn\u201d in a case eventually settled out of court. Mariah Carey is suing Lianna Azarian for $3m, alleging that Azarian filmed her in order to blackmail her. Azarian is countersuing, alleging that Carey\u2019s former manager, among other things, urinated on her while the singer watched (nice!). And so it goes on. Aside from lawsuits, the general rule seems to be that, somewhere along the line, the celebrity boss gets denounced for being a diva. It\u2019s as though, when things go wrong, the power imbalance between employer and employee is redeployed as a powerful PR weapon. It helps that the public has been \u201cgroomed\u201d to accept the idea of celebrities as divas, mainly because so many of the spoiled twerps are. Who hasn\u2019t heard of Carey insisting on kittens to pet backstage, or declaring that she doesn\u2019t \u201cdo stairs\u201d? The recent Netflix documentary on the Fyre festival debacle is a salutary lesson in what happens when ordinary, everyday Instagrammers \u201cgo diva\u201d. However, \u201cdiva\u201d isn\u2019t always a women-only deal, even though, apart from some gay men, it\u2019s generally famous females who get saddled with the demanding, high-maintenance \u201cdiva\u201d label, which is then easily believed and hard to shake off. By contrast, it seems to take many years and incidents (sometimes real ugliness) before men get branded divas. Johnny Depp was firing the remains of the writer Hunter S Thompson from a cannon (estimated cost: $3m) before people started questioning his \u201clifestyle choices\u201d. In some ways, bring it on \u2013 who doesn\u2019t thrill to hear of a celebrity monster behaving like a total fright? One day, I pray, an assistant with a sense of humour will sue a celebrity for not being enough of a diva (\u201cThey were too down to earth and reasonable \u2013 I suffered boredom injuries\u201d). What isn\u2019t funny, what makes the issue dark, is the distinct male/female diva divide and what that suggests. Too often, the diva tag comes across as just another way of deriding and undermining successful, powerful women who happen to work in the entertainment industry. A case of if you can\u2019t get away with labelling them a slut, brand them a diva. A similar dynamic operates in normal workspaces, where forceful men are considered dynamic and commanding, while forceful women are condemned as strident ball-breakers. So all power to the female diva \u2013 as long as people remember that often all it means is that a woman is powerful enough to make demands and determined enough to get them met. Thank you for the music, Bros, but a TV career would be more entertaining Nice to see Matt and Luke Goss\u2019s continued good humour regarding the reaction to the Bros documentary After the Screaming Stops. Hilarious one minute \u2013 never before in pop-cultural history have two middle-aged men mused so intensely about conkers \u2013 full of pathos the next, the documentary was a blast. It would take a heart of stone not to wish the twins all the best with their comeback. Just one thing \u2013 does it have to involve music? Bros always had a disconcerting image: comprised almost entirely of bandanas and quiffs, they resembled a double-headed Tintin mutant. However, it was their music that really stunk up the place. Bros made Jive Bunny sound like the Velvet Underground. Judging by the documentary, said songs have not improved; if anything, they\u2019ve degraded further, like pop socks left hanging, forgotten, on a washing line since 1988. I\u2019m not being a musical snob \u2013 I\u2019m just begging Bros not to make any new music. The odd reunion show would be fine \u2013 if we really can\u2019t talk them out of it \u2013 but perhaps best to stop there. In my opinion, Bros didn\u2019t make good music. However, they did make incredible television. The road ahead seems clear. Sorry, Meghan, but this is a part you\u2019ll have to play for ever Suits, the US legal drama that starred Meghan Markle, now Duchess of Sussex, is to be axed. I watched this show (all the series, from the start) long before she showed up with Prince Harry. Her character, Rachel, pursued her legal ambitions while romantically tussling with the fake but brilliant Mike. It was surreal to see someone who\u2019d had an absurdly complicated on-screen relationship with Mike turn up in real life to embark on an absurdly complicated relationship with sections of the British press. For me, the biggest thrill of the royal wedding was seeing cast members of Suits squashed into pews, their faces suggesting that they didn\u2019t realise that they\u2019d signed up for the St George\u2019s Chapel cheap seats. Suits has since played an underlying but pivotal role in the often preposterously nasty treatment of the duchess. While early coverage of the couple was cloying, the recent negativity directed at her has been nightmarish. Endless reports of spats with Kate, Duchess of Cambridge. Overpriced clothes. Holding her bump too much. Being American. Being too enthusiastic during public appearances. To the Tower with her! Nice work, all those joining in; hounding a pregnant woman \u2013 very classy. At least, as Rachel, Meghan only had Mike to deal with. Now, she has a vocal section of humanity denigrating her every move. Which is where Suits comes in. Often, her detractors point out that she\u2019s an actress and therefore everything she does is just an act. Does this mean that anybody who\u2019s ever been involved in the performing arts is incapable of having a relationship? Playing along for the moment, one can only wonder which \u201cstorylines\u201d she has found the most challenging thus far \u2013 Suits or the royal family? And does she yet realise that, for good or ill, this is a role from which she is never going to escape? \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

It\u2019s monumental news, but we\u2019re still at the early stages,\u201d said Graeme Smith, Afghanistan analyst with the International Crisis Group. \u201cWe know the agreement has four parts: ceasefire, counter-terrorism, troop withdrawal, and intra-Afghan negotiations. Sequencing and timelines remain tricky.\u201d</p> <p>Baradar was a founding member of the movement and close aide to the first Taliban leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/30/mullah-omar\" title=\"\">Mullah Mohammed Omar</a>. Once the Taliban\u2019s military chief, he is hugely respected in the insurgent movement, but has also long sought a negotiated end to the war. He had reached out unsuccessfully to the US and the Afghan government in the past, and in 2010 he was arrested by Pakistani forces apparently angered by his unauthorised efforts to broker peace talks.</p> <p>\u201c[Baradar\u2019s new role] is good news for the peace process,\u201d Mohammad Umer Daudzai, the Afghan president\u2019s special envoy on peace, told the <em>New York Times</em>. \u201cHe is one of the top two leaders. If he is leading the negotiations, he can make decisions more quickly.</p> <p>He will now head the Taliban\u2019s office in Qatar, the de facto embassy and international headquarters for the militant group, and site of recent talks with a US delegation.</p> <p>The US peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, arrived in the Gulf state on Monday for the week of talks, although he had met the Taliban several times before. Once the US ambassador in Kabul, he was asked this autumn by President Donald Trump to try to find an end to America\u2019s longest war.</p> <p>After several days of talks, the two sides had finalised some clauses to be included in a draft peace deal. The agreement included apparent concessions from both sides, including a commitment that foreign forces would be scheduled to withdraw 18 months after a deal was signed. The departure of western troops is a core Taliban demand.</p> <p>In return the insurgents, who now threaten two-thirds of the country, would commit to keeping international terrorist groups, including al-Qaida and Isis, off Afghan soil or from using it to launch attacks abroad, one of Washington\u2019s top priorities.</p> <p>It was not clear if the US had fully accepted the provisions, and the absence of Afghan government representatives was a reminder that not all parties were present at the table. The Taliban have said they will not talk to Kabul officials, whom they denounce as a puppet government, until a ceasefire is struck.</p> <p>Khalilzad is now heading to Kabul to brief President Ashraf Ghani on the talks, and while there is some scepticism in the presidential palace, there is also a growing desperation for peace among ordinary Afghans. A brief ceasefire last year was greeted with joy by both Taliban and government supporters, but since then violence has spiralled.</p> <p>Ghani admitted on Friday that 45,000 members of Afghanistan\u2019s security forces had been killed since he took power in 2014, and the UN has warned fighting is taking a record toll on civilians. For years, talks were rejected by one side or another in the bitter conflict \u2013 at various times the US-led foreign forces, Afghan officials and the Taliban themselves have turned down overtures from their enemies. And there were almost farcical errors, including when a shopkeeper impersonated a Taliban leader at talks with top Afghan and Nato officials, and the Taliban delegation that claimed to represent Mullah Omar when he had actually been dead for years.</p>",

It\u2019s monumental news, but we\u2019re still at the early stages,\u201d said Graeme Smith, Afghanistan analyst with the International Crisis Group. \u201cWe know the agreement has four parts: ceasefire, counter-terrorism, troop withdrawal, and intra-Afghan negotiations. Sequencing and timelines remain tricky.\u201d Baradar was a founding member of the movement and close aide to the first Taliban leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar. Once the Taliban\u2019s military chief, he is hugely respected in the insurgent movement, but has also long sought a negotiated end to the war. He had reached out unsuccessfully to the US and the Afghan government in the past, and in 2010 he was arrested by Pakistani forces apparently angered by his unauthorised efforts to broker peace talks. \u201c[Baradar\u2019s new role] is good news for the peace process,\u201d Mohammad Umer Daudzai, the Afghan president\u2019s special envoy on peace, told the New York Times. \u201cHe is one of the top two leaders. If he is leading the negotiations, he can make decisions more quickly. He will now head the Taliban\u2019s office in Qatar, the de facto embassy and international headquarters for the militant group, and site of recent talks with a US delegation. The US peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, arrived in the Gulf state on Monday for the week of talks, although he had met the Taliban several times before. Once the US ambassador in Kabul, he was asked this autumn by President Donald Trump to try to find an end to America\u2019s longest war. After several days of talks, the two sides had finalised some clauses to be included in a draft peace deal. The agreement included apparent concessions from both sides, including a commitment that foreign forces would be scheduled to withdraw 18 months after a deal was signed. The departure of western troops is a core Taliban demand. In return the insurgents, who now threaten two-thirds of the country, would commit to keeping international terrorist groups, including al-Qaida and Isis, off Afghan soil or from using it to launch attacks abroad, one of Washington\u2019s top priorities. It was not clear if the US had fully accepted the provisions, and the absence of Afghan government representatives was a reminder that not all parties were present at the table. The Taliban have said they will not talk to Kabul officials, whom they denounce as a puppet government, until a ceasefire is struck. Khalilzad is now heading to Kabul to brief President Ashraf Ghani on the talks, and while there is some scepticism in the presidential palace, there is also a growing desperation for peace among ordinary Afghans. A brief ceasefire last year was greeted with joy by both Taliban and government supporters, but since then violence has spiralled. Ghani admitted on Friday that 45,000 members of Afghanistan\u2019s security forces had been killed since he took power in 2014, and the UN has warned fighting is taking a record toll on civilians. For years, talks were rejected by one side or another in the bitter conflict \u2013 at various times the US-led foreign forces, Afghan officials and the Taliban themselves have turned down overtures from their enemies. And there were almost farcical errors, including when a shopkeeper impersonated a Taliban leader at talks with top Afghan and Nato officials, and the Taliban delegation that claimed to represent Mullah Omar when he had actually been dead for years.",

      "body": "<p>The secret history of modern Britain is made in obscure corners between men and women taken seriously by no one but themselves. A good time to begin it would be in the winter of 2013/14 when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/30/labour-calls-for-inquiry-into-iea-thinktank-over-cash-for-access-claims\" title=\"\">Institute of Economic Affairs</a>, a rightist outfit that won\u2019t reveal where its money comes from, offered <a href=\"https://iea.org.uk/multimedia/video/iea-brexit-prize\" title=\"\">a \u20ac100,000 prize</a> to whoever could devise a means of leaving the European Union.</p> <p>The reason why politicians are now stumbling towards disaster like prisoners marching to the scaffold ought to have been clear from that moment. Obviously, Britain can leave the EU, but only if it is willing to pay an extortionate price. Yet first the institute\u2019s judges, led by Nigel Lawson and Gisela Stuart, then the Leave campaigns of Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Dominic Cummings and, finally, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn, who even now cannot speak plainly, have refused to acknowledge the harsh truth.</p> <p>As if to anticipate their failings, the winning entry came from a minor functionary in the British embassy in Manila by the name of <a href=\"https://iea.org.uk/multimedia/video/iea-brexit-prize-meet-the-winner\" title=\"\">Iain Mansfield</a>. He brushed away the difficulties of leaving the EU and offered us our first helping of unicorn cake. Britain, he declared, could enjoy the free movement of capital and goods in the single market, he announced, but stop the free movement of labour.</p> <p>His triumph marked an ominous moment. Until 2013, even rightwing politicians accepted that they could not have the best of all possible worlds. Britain was tied into an integrated European economy. No government could wrench it away in a couple of years. Britain would have to stay in the customs union, as Liam Fox <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/liam-fox-speech-eu-customs-union-brexit-europe-trade-deal-a8230571.html\" title=\"\">said in 2012</a>. The most significant thinker in the Brexit movement went further. Richard North, the advocate of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=85981\" title=\"\">Flexcit</a>\u201d, warned that, as a sudden departure would wreck people\u2019s lives, Britain would have to be like Norway and stay in the single market, \u201cat least in the medium term\u201d, as it dedicated many years, maybe more than a decade, to flexible negotiations about a future arrangement.</p> <p>Rationally, a flexible approach made sense. But by the winter of 2013 the market for rational politics was faltering. <a href=\"http://www.eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=84879\" title=\"\">North described</a> how Lawson and his fellow judges excluded from the shortlist entries that said the only way to leave the EU was to follow the Norwegian example. Until that point, he had had regular meetings with Arron Banks, Owen Patterson and Cummings. \u201cBut something then happened \u2013 I don\u2019t know what. Cummings went dark on me and I was \u2018no platformed\u2019.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Electorally, allowing millions to believe that the impossible was possible was perfect post-rational politics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You don\u2019t need to be a detective to work out why the darkness fell. How could the Brexit campaign inspire nationalist passions, how could Fox, Lawson, Johnson, Farage and Banks inspire even themselves, if they were to say that the only rational way to leave the EU was to carry on paying money, accepting freedom of movement and receiving laws that Britain had no say in making, while an orderly retreat was organised? Who would vote for that? What would be the point of leaving at all?</p> <p>Better to take the road to Narnia and promise everything while committing to nothing. After the prize was awarded to a political fantasy, Cummings gave fair warning of what was coming next. <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/2015/06/23/on-the-referendum-6-exit-plans-and-a-second-referendum/\" title=\"\">Writing in 2015</a>, he admitted that the campaign would offer no exit plan: hard Brexit, soft Brexit or any Brexit in between. \u201cThere is much to be gained from swerving the whole issue,\u201d he explained. Opponents of the EU \u201chave been divided for years\u201d. In any case, \u201cthe sheer complexity of leaving would involve endless questions of detail that cannot be answered\u201d.</p> <p>An honourable man, and an honourable political movement, would have found these excellent reasons to think again. Not Cummings and not the Brexit movement. Intellectually, their Brexit was an empty idea. But electorally, allowing millions to believe that the impossible was possible was perfect post-rational politics. As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rolandmcs/status/1087332027827929088\" title=\"\">Roland Smith of</a> the Adam Smith Institute, another rightwing thinktank, said last week, the \u201cdirty secret\u201d of the Leave campaign was that it \u201cdidn\u2019t have a well-formed idea of how to leave the EU or indeed whether any alternative was really palatable\u201d.</p> <p>It is easy to portray Cummings, Johnson and Farage as grand villains. Indeed, if we crash out with no deal, we will be hard pressed to find so much misery brought to so many by so few. But the Cameron government, every MP who voted for the referendum, the supposedly ferocious interviewers at the BBC and hard-nosed journalists in the press let them get away with it. None insisted that the voters be told what form of Brexit they were voting for.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/08/how-99-strangers-in-a-dublin-hotel-broke-irelands-abortion-deadlock\">How 99 strangers in a Dublin hotel broke Ireland's abortion deadlock</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a point of contrast, consider that in 2018 Ireland discussed removing its constitutional ban on abortion. There was an exhaustive debate at a citizens\u2019 assembly on the proposed measures and the government published a <a href=\"https://health.gov.ie/blog/publications/policy-paper-on-regulation-of-termination-of-pregnancy/\" title=\"\">policy paper</a> outlining in what circumstances abortion would be legal if the reform were approved in a referendum, so that no one could argue about the result. As a matter of deliberate policy by Brexit\u2019s supporters, and as a consequence of unforgivable negligence by politicians and journalists, Britain\u2019s referendum offered no such clarity.</p> <p>I hope you can now see the consequences of obscure arguments in political backwaters. Supporters of a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d are met with the superficially plausible objection: \u201cBut we\u2019ve already had a referendum.\u201d Supporters of May\u2019s deal and the \u201cNorway option\u201d face the objection that the Leave campaign never told them that we would have to accept EU rules once we left. Finally, for the supporters of a hard Brexit and the millions who risk their futures by believing them, crashing out and crying \u201cto hell with it\u201d are the logical consequences of the illogical retreat from reason they began in 2013.</p> <p>For good or ill, you can guarantee that the arguments that affect us most are the ones that never make it on to evening news. In the case of Brexit Britain, it\u2019s all ill.</p> <p>\u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "The secret history of modern Britain is made in obscure corners between men and women taken seriously by no one but themselves. A good time to begin it would be in the winter of 2013/14 when the Institute of Economic Affairs, a rightist outfit that won\u2019t reveal where its money comes from, offered a \u20ac100,000 prize to whoever could devise a means of leaving the European Union. The reason why politicians are now stumbling towards disaster like prisoners marching to the scaffold ought to have been clear from that moment. Obviously, Britain can leave the EU, but only if it is willing to pay an extortionate price. Yet first the institute\u2019s judges, led by Nigel Lawson and Gisela Stuart, then the Leave campaigns of Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Dominic Cummings and, finally, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn, who even now cannot speak plainly, have refused to acknowledge the harsh truth. As if to anticipate their failings, the winning entry came from a minor functionary in the British embassy in Manila by the name of Iain Mansfield. He brushed away the difficulties of leaving the EU and offered us our first helping of unicorn cake. Britain, he declared, could enjoy the free movement of capital and goods in the single market, he announced, but stop the free movement of labour. His triumph marked an ominous moment. Until 2013, even rightwing politicians accepted that they could not have the best of all possible worlds. Britain was tied into an integrated European economy. No government could wrench it away in a couple of years. Britain would have to stay in the customs union, as Liam Fox said in 2012. The most significant thinker in the Brexit movement went further. Richard North, the advocate of \u201cFlexcit\u201d, warned that, as a sudden departure would wreck people\u2019s lives, Britain would have to be like Norway and stay in the single market, \u201cat least in the medium term\u201d, as it dedicated many years, maybe more than a decade, to flexible negotiations about a future arrangement. Rationally, a flexible approach made sense. But by the winter of 2013 the market for rational politics was faltering. North described how Lawson and his fellow judges excluded from the shortlist entries that said the only way to leave the EU was to follow the Norwegian example. Until that point, he had had regular meetings with Arron Banks, Owen Patterson and Cummings. \u201cBut something then happened \u2013 I don\u2019t know what. Cummings went dark on me and I was \u2018no platformed\u2019.\u201d You don\u2019t need to be a detective to work out why the darkness fell. How could the Brexit campaign inspire nationalist passions, how could Fox, Lawson, Johnson, Farage and Banks inspire even themselves, if they were to say that the only rational way to leave the EU was to carry on paying money, accepting freedom of movement and receiving laws that Britain had no say in making, while an orderly retreat was organised? Who would vote for that? What would be the point of leaving at all? Better to take the road to Narnia and promise everything while committing to nothing. After the prize was awarded to a political fantasy, Cummings gave fair warning of what was coming next. Writing in 2015, he admitted that the campaign would offer no exit plan: hard Brexit, soft Brexit or any Brexit in between. \u201cThere is much to be gained from swerving the whole issue,\u201d he explained. Opponents of the EU \u201chave been divided for years\u201d. In any case, \u201cthe sheer complexity of leaving would involve endless questions of detail that cannot be answered\u201d. An honourable man, and an honourable political movement, would have found these excellent reasons to think again. Not Cummings and not the Brexit movement. Intellectually, their Brexit was an empty idea. But electorally, allowing millions to believe that the impossible was possible was perfect post-rational politics. As Roland Smith of the Adam Smith Institute, another rightwing thinktank, said last week, the \u201cdirty secret\u201d of the Leave campaign was that it \u201cdidn\u2019t have a well-formed idea of how to leave the EU or indeed whether any alternative was really palatable\u201d. It is easy to portray Cummings, Johnson and Farage as grand villains. Indeed, if we crash out with no deal, we will be hard pressed to find so much misery brought to so many by so few. But the Cameron government, every MP who voted for the referendum, the supposedly ferocious interviewers at the BBC and hard-nosed journalists in the press let them get away with it. None insisted that the voters be told what form of Brexit they were voting for. As a point of contrast, consider that in 2018 Ireland discussed removing its constitutional ban on abortion. There was an exhaustive debate at a citizens\u2019 assembly on the proposed measures and the government published a policy paper outlining in what circumstances abortion would be legal if the reform were approved in a referendum, so that no one could argue about the result. As a matter of deliberate policy by Brexit\u2019s supporters, and as a consequence of unforgivable negligence by politicians and journalists, Britain\u2019s referendum offered no such clarity. I hope you can now see the consequences of obscure arguments in political backwaters. Supporters of a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d are met with the superficially plausible objection: \u201cBut we\u2019ve already had a referendum.\u201d Supporters of May\u2019s deal and the \u201cNorway option\u201d face the objection that the Leave campaign never told them that we would have to accept EU rules once we left. Finally, for the supporters of a hard Brexit and the millions who risk their futures by believing them, crashing out and crying \u201cto hell with it\u201d are the logical consequences of the illogical retreat from reason they began in 2013. For good or ill, you can guarantee that the arguments that affect us most are the ones that never make it on to evening news. In the case of Brexit Britain, it\u2019s all ill. \u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "Championship Leeds moved three points clear at the top thanks to a 2-1 win at Rotherham. In a game lacking a cutting edge, Semi Ajayi took matters into his own hands by smashing a goal in from 30 yards for the Millers. Mateusz Klich levelled things up in the 51st minute with a scrappy goal from close range and the Polish midfielder completed the comeback victory with a low shot from inside the area. Second hosted fourth at Carrow Road where Norwich drew 2-2 with Sheffield United. Argos-loving Onel Hern\u00e1ndez instigated the scoring when he latched on to a through ball and calmly converted Norwich\u2019s first. Moments before the break, Billy Sharp kept his composure to equalise from the penalty spot after Emiliano Buend\u00eda had felled Enda Stevens. Naturally, it was Teemu Pukki who regained the advantage for the hosts with a stunning finish before Sharp netted the second equaliser, heading home after being left in space at the back post. Paul Lambert returned to Aston Villa in the hope of kickstarting Ipswich\u2019s fight for survival but instead they lost 2-1. Ipswich were behind within six minutes when Tammy Abraham turned home a Conor Hourihane free-kick for his 18th league goal of the season. Albert Adomah had a disallowed for offside on the half-hour mark to ensure things did not get any worse for Ipswich. Things did not improve after the break when Abraham sent the goalkeeper the wrong way from 12 yards. Freddie Sears got Ipswich back into the match by rifling a shot into the top corner from distance. Blackburn had few problems against Hull, wining 3-0. Adam Armstrong started the score, before Jack Rodwell headed home from a corner for his first goal since September 2017. Harrison Reed added some gloss in the 73rd minute. Nathan Jones will not have enjoyed seeing his Stoke side lose 2-0 at home to Preston. Alan Browne silenced the bet365 Stadium after Darnell Fisher\u2019s strike was saved by Jack Butland but the rebound landed at the Preston midfielder\u2019s feet.

However, they were left to rue a woeful effort from Joe Garner, which was saved by Pantilimon. League One Luton made the most of Portsmouth\u2019s FA Cup exploits by leapfrogging them into top spot as they picked up a 1-0 win at Southend, with Matty Pearson scoring the only goal of the game. Barnsley moved into third after coming from behind to defeat Rochdale 2-1 at Oakwell. Ian Henderson gave the visitors the lead but Kieffer Moore and Cauley Woodrow turned things around. The South Yorkshire side moved ahead of Charlton who were held to a goalless draw at Peterborough, as Addicks striker Karlan Grant saw a desperate penalty saved. The point was not enough to keep Steve Evans in a job, Peterborough waiting only 35 minutes after the final whistle to part company with the manager. League Two Sol Campbell\u2019s Macclesfield suffered heartbreak at Cheltenham, losing 3-2. The visitors were two goals ahead but played most of the game with 10 men following Nathan Cameron\u2019s dismissal, culminating in a Charlie Raglan winner. Mansfield eased to a 3-0 victory over Tranmere, who had Ollie Banks sent off. Exeter moved into a play-off spot thanks to Nicky Law scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win against Cambridge. Harry Davis saw red for Grimsby but they held on for a 1-0 win against MK Dons. Crewe gained revenge for a 6-0 drubbing at Colchester earlier this season by defeating the same opposition 2-1 at Gresty Road, their fourth home win in a row.",

      "body": "<p>I had come to see Diana in her bright, lovely room at the Mary Feilding Guild in north London, the place itself as perfect a version of assisted living as you could imagine. I was interviewing her for a magazine called the <em>gentlewoman </em>a couple of years ago<em>.</em> Diana was intrigued by the magazine\u2019s name, until I told her that the magazine the same company produced for men was called <em>Fantastic Man.</em> Diana was outraged. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it called <em>Fantastic Woman?</em>\u201d she exclaimed. If there was ever anyone who deserved the label Fantastic Woman, it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/diana-athill\" title=\"\">Diana Athill.</a></p> <p>Fantastic in her openness, her honesty, her humour, her complete lack of interest in what are commonly supposed to be life\u2019s ordinary proprieties but which are, usually, simply stultifying convention. To be in her presence was to be reminded that every day of one\u2019s life is a gift and that it\u2019s never too late.</p> <p>She worked hard all her life as an editor and was integral to the success of authors such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/vsnaipaul\" title=\"\">VS Naipaul</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/sep/16/classics\" title=\"\">Jean Rhys;</a> her writing mostly took a back seat. She was in her 80s by the time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/aug/04/biography.highereducation\" title=\"\"><em>Stet,</em></a> her memoir of a life in publishing, catapulted her to unexpected literary fame.</p> <p>She never married, but a well-bred young woman born in the last year of the first world war would have been expected to marry. She would very plainly say that her failure to marry made her feel, when she was younger, that her life was in every way a failure. She had to fight to make her way in the world and listening to her acknowledge her struggles made it easier to acknowledge one\u2019s own. At literary events, it was extraordinarily moving to see readers open up to her, to see her truly listen and respond with real kindness.</p> <p>But what also made Diana fantastic was her sense of fun, her delight in the world. Of course, it was fine to talk about literature with her, but was it really more wonderful than discussing the treasures to be found in the jewellery counters of the V&amp;A shop? Did I know about the delights to be found in the Wrap catalogue before I met Diana?

      "bodyText": "I had come to see Diana in her bright, lovely room at the Mary Feilding Guild in north London, the place itself as perfect a version of assisted living as you could imagine. I was interviewing her for a magazine called the gentlewoman a couple of years ago. Diana was intrigued by the magazine\u2019s name, until I told her that the magazine the same company produced for men was called Fantastic Man. Diana was outraged. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it called Fantastic Woman?\u201d she exclaimed. If there was ever anyone who deserved the label Fantastic Woman, it was Diana Athill. Fantastic in her openness, her honesty, her humour, her complete lack of interest in what are commonly supposed to be life\u2019s ordinary proprieties but which are, usually, simply stultifying convention. To be in her presence was to be reminded that every day of one\u2019s life is a gift and that it\u2019s never too late. She worked hard all her life as an editor and was integral to the success of authors such as VS Naipaul and Jean Rhys; her writing mostly took a back seat. She was in her 80s by the time Stet, her memoir of a life in publishing, catapulted her to unexpected literary fame. She never married, but a well-bred young woman born in the last year of the first world war would have been expected to marry. She would very plainly say that her failure to marry made her feel, when she was younger, that her life was in every way a failure. She had to fight to make her way in the world and listening to her acknowledge her struggles made it easier to acknowledge one\u2019s own. At literary events, it was extraordinarily moving to see readers open up to her, to see her truly listen and respond with real kindness. But what also made Diana fantastic was her sense of fun, her delight in the world. Of course, it was fine to talk about literature with her, but was it really more wonderful than discussing the treasures to be found in the jewellery counters of the V&amp;A shop? Did I know about the delights to be found in the Wrap catalogue before I met Diana? I did not. Her elegance, combined with that perfect skin, the brilliance of her deep-set blue eyes, that snowy hair and striking profile, might have been intimidating, but it wasn\u2019t: it was joyful. As was the delight she took in her friends \u2013 her friendships were vigorously cross-generational and I know that even now Diana is gone, those of us who knew her will be bound by her memory. \u201cI\u2019m a good recoverer,\u201d she said to me once. It\u2019s a quote to remember. Tough stuff will happen; you will suffer; but you\u2019ll recover. Bless you, Diana. How lucky we were to know you.",

      "body": "<p>Emilie Pine, 41, is an associate professor of modern drama at University College, Dublin. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/notes-to-self-9780241393642.html\" title=\"\"><em>Notes to Self,</em></a> her first non-academic book, is a personal, courageous and compulsively readable collection of essays about what it is to be a woman; it explores taboo subjects \u2013 infertility, miscarriage, menstruation, self-starvation, the rape she experienced as a teenager and the effects of alcoholism in a family.</p> <p><strong>Your book begins with a gripping account of your alcoholic father who is suffering liver failure in an under-staffed Greek hospital. You and your sister have to improvise as his nurses</strong><strong>.</strong><br>My dad got sick in 2013 \u2013 a year of hospitals. The good news is that he is still alive and no longer drinking. But in 2014, I felt the need to get it all out of my head. You know that feeling \u2013 a crisis is over, yet it is not over because you\u2019re still experiencing the emotional fallout? I wrote a journal, printed out the pages symbolically, put them in a drawer.</p> <p>Then my partner, who is a writer \u2013 and great reader \u2013 stumbled across them. He read the top sheets, asked what they were and what I was going to do with them. I said: leave them in the drawer, obviously. He said it was maybe the best thing I had written. I thought about it for two years before sending it to Tramp Press [the collection\u2019s original Irish publisher]. I knew they didn\u2019t publish non-fiction but wanted their opinion. A couple of months later, they asked, on the basis of 8,000 words, if I had a book. I said: \u201cWhat would I write about?\u201d They said: \u201cAnything you like.\u201d</p> <p>Women sometimes feel the need to be given permission to treat their emotions and lives as important. It was like being given this massive permission slip. I sat on the bus, on the way home \u2013 all the glamour! \u2013 and had a random piece of paper \u2013 because I believe in paper \u2013 and scribbled down five ideas, which became the other essays in this book.</p> <p><strong>How much is the opening essay chafing against the way family love can turn into onerous duty?</strong><br>In the case of loving an addict, it is hugely complicated by decades of emotional abuse. It is one thing to care for a parent who has cared for you; it is quite another to care for a parent who has been selfish and extremely hurtful for decades.</p> <p>It was one of the things I was most ashamed of admitting in the book: the points where I thought, am I going to do this? I decided it would do more harm to me to walk away. You constantly have to think about where you set boundaries. An addict will always violate those boundaries and you feel like a bad person for enforcing them.</p> <p><strong>To what extent has your life been marked by your father\u2019s alcoholism?</strong><br>From start to finish. I grew up adoring my dad, wanting to be my dad because he was always larger than life. But, even as a very young child, I knew not to rely on him. The way my mother brought us up has made me probably fiercer than I needed to be about emotional and financial independence and not allowing oneself to be vulnerable.</p> <p><strong>Speaking of vulnerability, why, as you make clear, is it so hard for some women to take care of themselves?</strong><br>Did we even use the term \u201cself-care\u201d two years ago? It is now bandied about and is not synonymous with taking baths, manicures, going on mini-breaks. So many stories in <em>Notes to Self </em>are about not having a vocabulary to deal with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/depression\" title=\"\">depression</a> \u2013 not being able to admit, recognise or address it. I\u2019ve been amazed by the number of outwardly successful, stable, happy women who have been in touch with me about this.</p> <p>One successful journalist told me that she sometimes cannot get out of bed because she hates herself so much. Men can fall into this bracket too. For example, there is an incredibly important new memoir by Arnold Thomas Fanning, published by Penguin, called <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/mind-on-fire.html\" title=\"\"><em>Mind on Fire</em></a> \u2013 about living with and recovering from bipolar disease. Reading his and my book together might be an interesting project about the different ways in which vulnerability manifests itself.</p> <p><strong>What response have you had to your essay on the sexual violence you experienced as a teenager?</strong><br> Writing that essay was incredibly distressing because I had to re-experience the emotions of it. But many women have been in touch saying: exactly the same thing happened to me \u2013 because I was raped by someone I knew and not beaten up, I did not class it as rape.</p> <p><strong>You describe your infertility as a </strong><strong>\u201cparticular kind of loneliness</strong><strong>\u201d\u2026</strong><br>I wrote the essay I needed to read. I didn\u2019t feel I had anybody to talk to aside from my partner about what we were going through and felt completely isolated. That is partly because others do not share their experiences \u2013 except on websites. The chat form can feel like solidarity but you don\u2019t know the people or their backstories and they suddenly disappear and you don\u2019t know why.Loneliness is imposed from outside and from within.

against his former club Middlesbrough as Newport County earned a FA Cup fourth-round replay at Rodney Parade. A 87th-minute substitute, the 25-year-old midfielder, who started his career at Boro, hammered in a leveller to ramp up the pressure on manager Tony Pulis, whose side led through a Daniel Ayala header. Boro also handed Jon Obi Mikel his debut. But Newport, who beat Leeds before taking Tottenham to a replay at this stage of the competition last season, drew level with seconds left to play at the Riverside. \u201cFor the effort and quality they produced, the boys got their just rewards,\u201d the Newport manager, Michael Flynn, said. Meanwhile, Premier League side Wolves rescued a replay against Shrewsbury thanks to Matt Doherty\u2019s last-gasp goal at New Meadow.

Goals by Greg Docherty and Luke Waterfall sent Shrewsbury into a two-goal lead before Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, and then Doherty, sealed a replay. FA Cup fourth round Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 0-0 West Bromwich Albion Doncaster Rovers 2-1 Oldham Athletic Manchester City 5-0 Burnley Middlesbrough 1-1 Newport County Newcastle United 0-2 Watford Portsmouth 1-1 Queens Park Rangers Shrewsbury Town 2-2 Wolverhampton Wanderers Swansea City 4-1 Gillingham Championship Aston Villa 2-1 Ipswich Blackburn 3-0 Hull City Norwich City 2-2 Sheff Utd Nottingham Forest 3-1 Wigan Rotherham 1-2 Leeds United Stoke City 0-2 Preston North End Matty Dolan strikes. And the League Two look to have won a replay. That is not good news for under-pressure Tony Pulis. Matt Doherty surely rescues a replay. Jutst like that, Ben Whiteman adds his second and Doncaster are back in pole position with seconds left to play. Grant McCann is doing a great job up at the Keepmoat Stadium. And drama at New Meadow ... Isaac Success puts the icing on the cake. Javi Gracia will be feeling very happy with himself after his bold decision to ring the changes. Rafa Benitez and Newcastle will not be feeling quite so sweet. Peter Clarke grabs an equaliser. Oldham\u2019s FA Cup fairytale rolls on \u2013 for now at least. City add a fifth from the penalty spot. And Swansea are 4-1 to the good at home to Gillingham, thanks to Barrie McKay. Billy Sharp scores \u2013 again! He adds his second of the afternoon as Sheffield United equalise for a second time at Carrow Road. Less than 10 minutes left ... but Norwich do score their fair share of late goals. And Leeds lead at Rotherham. Mateusz Klich adds his second of the game! And the Leeds fans are going potty. Preston lead 2-0 at Stoke! Brad Potts has got it, his second goal in as many games for his new club after joining from Barnsley. Stoke are not going to secure an immediate return to the Premier League, are they? Also in the second tier, breathing space for Nottingham Forest, thanks to Guedioura adding a third goal at home to Wigan. Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s side lead 3-1. Steve McClaren\u2019s side pull level at Fratton Park. Meanwhile, Doncaster are 1-0 up against Oldham courtesy of Ben Whiteman. The forward was freed by Herbie Kane, the talented Liverpool loanee, after great work by Alfie May. In the Championship, Blackburn lead Hull 3-0. Ah, Pep Guardiola\u2019s side are home and hosed. Just what the doctor ordered. Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez earns Wolves a lifeline at the New Meadow. On at the hour mark, the Mexican pulls a goal back. Can Wolves summon a late fightback against the League One side? Tempers are fraying off the pitch too. It\u2019s heating up. Bersant Celina\u2019s fifth goal of the season restores Swansea\u2019s two-goal advantage at the Liberty Stadium. Meanwhile, it remains goalless at Brighton. A damp squib, by all accounts. Tosin Adarabioyo has just headed against the crossbar for the visitors, though, while Seagulls midfielder Stephens earlier struck a post. The FA Cup fourth-round upset is in full swing. Luke Waterfall crashes home a header from a corner and Wolves are in deep trouble. Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez is on for the visitors but, while a few players have been rested, it is still a strong Wolves side, including Ruben Neves, Adama Traor\u00e9 and Conor Coady. Lee Brown, who started his career at QPR, opens the scoring at a rocking Fratton Park. It may well end up as a Joel Lynch end goal, though. A mini-upset of sorts. The City machine is ostensibly well-oiled and in full flow. Kevin De Bruyne adds a third, their 31st goal in their last eight games. Pep Guardiola\u2019s side are heading for a eighth consecutive victory. Andre Gray fires Javi Gracia\u2019s much-changed side in front at St James\u2019 Park. The striker opens the scoring on the hour mark for the Hornets. Those 11 changes suddenly don\u2019t look so silly anymore. Each of Gray\u2019s four goals in the FA Cup proper have come for different clubs \u2013 Hinckley Utd, Luton, Burnley \u2013 and Watford. More good work by Docherty, the Shrewsbury goalscorer, to give John Ruddy something else to think about. The Wolves goalkeeper makes a mess of it, after the hosts jetted up the other end following a fine stop from Steve Arnold to deny Helder Costa an equaliser. The Portuguese should have buried his header from six yards out but Arnold saved smartly. The Premier League side are in a hole. Bernardo Silva has added a second at the Etihad. It comes moments after a dreadful mistake by Nicolas Otamendi teed up Matej Vydra to run clean through on goal ... only to fire into the side-netting. Time was on his side but Vydra got it all wrong. And now City are two goals to the good. Daniel Ayala gives Boro the lead at the Riverside. It is a scrappy header, from a corner. Of course. In the Championship, Forest have re-taken the lead over Wigan and a big goal for Leeds, with Klich finding an equaliser at the New York Stadium ... in Rotherham. Josh Rees heads home to pull a goal back. Game on! Greg Docherty nudges the hosts into the lead. At long last, we have an upset on the cards. Wolves made several changes for a local derby of sorts but Nuno Espirito Santo\u2019s side are yet to really get going. Docherty rifles his effort across goal and beyond John Ruddy into the top corner after a fine run by Fejiri Okenabirhie. There has not been an awful lot to get too excited about. Hopefully the second halves \u2013 just under way \u2013 will up the ante a little. Anyway, hear from Wally Downes and Glyn Hodges before the big one, in which AFC Wimbledon take on West Ham under the lights: Glyn Hodges admits he still can\u2019t quite believe his luck. \u201cI was just doing a bit of housework and a bit of gardening \u2013 the garden was looking magnificent,\u201d he grins. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it but football is weird. Sometimes an opportunity just comes out of the blue. When this one came I thought it was a no-brainer.\u201d Goals have been few and far between. FA Cup fourth round Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 0-0 West Bromwich Albion Doncaster Rovers 0-0 Oldham Athletic Manchester City 1-0 Burnley Middlesbrough 0-0 Newport County Newcastle United 0-0 Watford Portsmouth 0-0 Queens Park Rangers Shrewsbury Town 0-0 Wolverhampton Wanderers Swansea City 2-0 Gillingham Championship Aston Villa 1-0 Ipswich Blackburn 2-0 Hull City Norwich City 1-1 Sheff Utd Nottingham Forest 1-1 Wigan Rotherham 1-0 Leeds United Stoke City 0-1 Preston North End A comical error by Ryan Fulton gifts Celtic the lead, with Callum McGregor opening the scoring against Hamilton. Think Massimo Taibi v Southampton. And while Brighton &amp; Hove Albion v West Bromwich Albion is proving dull, Stirling Albion have gone one-up at Albion Rovers, courtesy of Peter MacDonald, which is nice. Oli McBurnie doubles his \u2013 and his side\u2019s tally. Swansea are seemingly cruising into the fifth round. Not the dream return to south Wales that Steve Lovell had hoped for. McBurnie\u2019s only previous hat-trick came during a loan spell along the M4 at Newport. The 22-year-old striker is unlikely to get a better chance to grab his first one for Swansea. So, Jesus scores past Pope \u2013 and Semi Ajayi scores past Leeds debutant Kiko Casilla! Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s side are behind at Rotherham. At the Etihad, it was a wonderful solo effort by Jesus, who wrung a couple of Burnley defenders inside out before hammering past Pope. Gabriel Jesus nets his 15th of the season to open the scoring. Nick Pope, back in between the sticks for Burnley, had made a couple of superb stops to deny Danilo and Kyle Walker, but Jesus finds a way through with a lovely finish. He jinks his way into the box before smashing home. A fine strike by the Brazilian. A few goals in the Championship: Preston lead at Stoke through Alan Browne to give Nathan Jones another headache, while Joe Lolley has poked Nottingham Forest in front at City Ground. And remember Jack Rodwell? The former Everton midfielder, playing at centre-half this afternoon, has added a second for Blackburn at home to Hull, who have been flying of late. It is Rodwell\u2019s first goal since September 2017. The former Sunderland man is under contract at Blackburn until May. Breaking news at the Etihad Stadium: a corner flag has snapped in half. The referee has no choice but to pause action for a moment. Luckily, the head groundsman Lee Jackson is on the scene, and installs a box-fresh corner flag fit for purpose. Kevin De Bruyne whipped in a delicious cross after the restart but nobody in a City shirt could connect at the back post. Oliver McBurnie shoots Swansea into the lead at the Liberty Stadium. And in the Championship, Norwich lead Sheffield United. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is among the spectators at the Etihad Stadium this afternoon, watching Manchester City take on Burnley. His Manchester United side sealed their spot in the next round at the Emirates last night. Things went from bad to worse for Unai Emery too, with injuries stacking up and concern over Koscielny: Aston Villa lead in the Championship! And, of course, it is Tammy Abraham who has got it, with the Chelsea loanee tapping home his 18th goal of the season. Staying in the second tier, Kiko Casilla is making his Leeds debut after joining from Real Madrid this month. And the goalkeeper has opted for the lesser-spotted short-sleeve shirt. In the FA Cup, a fairly cagey start around the grounds. We\u2019re under way in the three o\u2019clock kick-offs. And how about a sobering Newcastle statistic to truly whet the appetite? Newcastle have been eliminated from eight of their last nine FA Cup ties with Premier League opposition and haven\u2019t reached the fifth round since the 2005-06 season. After knocking out Cardiff, Steve Lovell returns to Swansea with Gillingham this afternoon, but for your Middlesbrough v Newport fix, look no further. Indulge in the tales of Tony Pulis and Michael Flynn, two managers who grew up on the mean streets of Pillgwenlly. They meet at the Riverside today: Bristol City, Manchester United, and now Derby County, are the teams already guaranteed a spot in Monday\u2019s fifth-round draw. A late strike by Martyn Waghorn was the difference at Accrington earlier. Both teams finished with 10 men: A quick nod to the Football League, where there are a stash of interesting games in the Championship and beyond this afternoon: Championship Aston Villa v Ipswich Blackburn v Hull City Norwich City v Sheff Utd Nottingham Forest v Wigan Rotherham v Leeds United Stoke City v Preston North End Team news news: they may be seventh in the Premier League and 14 points clear of the relegation zone but, nevertheless, Javi Gracia has made 11 changes to his Watford team at Newcastle. Staying in the north east, Tony Pulis hands a debut to new signing Jon Obi Mikel and brings Stewart Downing in from the cold. In Sussex, there is a first Brighton start for the former Wigan defender Dan Burn, while the teenage midfielder Rekeem Harper \u2013 who is just a dotting of the i\u2019s and a crossing of the t\u2019s away from penning a new contract \u2013 again starts for West Bromwich Albion: Brighton &amp; Hove Albion v West Bromwich Albion Brighton: Button, Bruno, Duffy, Burn, Montoya, Stephens, Kayal, Bissouma, Knockaert, Andone, Locadia Subs: Sanchez, Dunk, Gross, Murray, Pr\u00f6pper, Gyokeres, March West Brom: Bond, Mears, Adarabioyo, Bartley, Townsend, Field, Harper, Hoolahan, Leko, Edwards, Robson-Kanu Subs: Myhill, Fitzwater, Gibbs, Howkins, Holgate, Tulloch, Gayle Doncaster Rovers v Oldham Athletic Doncaster: Marosi, Mason, Anderson, Downing, Andrew, Whiteman, Kane, Sadlier, Coppinger, Marquis, May Subs: Jones, Wright, Blair, Wilks, Rowe, Crawford, Lewis Oldham: Iversen, Hamer, Clarke, Edmundson, Nepomuceno, Lang, Sylla, Missilou, Branger-Engone, Baxter, O\u2019Grady Subs: De La Paz, Dummigan, Benteke, Taylor, Vera, Hunt, Robinson Manchester City v Burnley Man City: Ederson, Walker, Danilo, Stones, Otamendi, Fernandinho, Gundogan, Mahrez, De Bruyne, Bernardo, Jesus Subs: Muric, Sterling, Ag\u00fcero, Laporte, San\u00e9, Silva, Foden Burnley: Pope, Long, Tarkowski, Gibson, Brady, Hendrick, Defour, Taylor, Ward, Vydra, McNeil Subs: Hart, Cork, Mee, Vokes, Barnes, Wood, Westwood Middlesbrough v Newport County Middlesbrough: Randolph, Shotton, Ayala, Flint, Friend, Mikel, Saville, Wing, Downing, Fletcher, Assombalonga Subs: Konstantopoulos, Batth, McNair, Clayton, Tavernier, van La Parra, Hugill Newport: Townsend, Butler, Willmott, Poole, Demetriou, Bakinson, Bennett, O\u2019Brien,, Semenyo, Amond, Matt Subs: Pipe, Labadie, Dolan, Marsh-Brown, Sheehan, Neufville Newcastle United v Watford Newcastle: Woodman; Manquillo, Fernandez, Lascelles, Clark, Ritchie; Hayden, Longstaff; Kenedy, Murphy, Joselu Subs: Dubravka, Yedlin, Lejeune, Schar, Atsu, Perez, Rondon Watford: Gomes, Janmaat, Cathcart, Britos, Masina, Quina, Wilmot, Chalobah, Success, Gray, Hughes Subs: Dahlberg, Mariappa, Navarra, Capoue, Penaranda, Deulofeu, Deeney Portsmouth v Queens Park Rangers Portsmouth: MacGillivray, Walkes, Whatmough, Clarke, Brown, Naylor, Donohue, Evans, Dennis, Curtis, Pitman Subs: Bass, Haunstrup, Burgess, Morris, Close, May, Maloney QPR: Lumley, Furlong, Leistner, Lynch, Bidwell, Wszolek, Manning, Scowen, Freeman, Oteh, Wells Subs: Ingram, Kakay, Hall, Cousins, Osayi-Samuel, Chair, Smith Shrewsbury Town v Wolverhampton Wanderers Shrewsbury: Arnold, Haynes, Sadler, Beckles, Docherty, Okenabirhie, Bolton, Waterfall, Laurent, Norburn, Grant Subs: Charles-Cook, Angol, Whalley, Vincelot, Holloway, Eisa, Sears Wolves: Ruddy, Bennett, Coady, Saiss, Doherty, Dendoncker, Neves, Giles, Gibbs-White, Traore, Costa Subs: Norris, Jonny, Cavaleiro, Gimenez, Moutinho, Vinagre, Kilman Swansea City v Gillingham Swansea: Mulder, Roberts, van der Hoorn, Carter-Vickers, John, Fer, Grimes, Celina, McKay, McBurnie, Baker-Richardson Subs: Nordfeldt, Montero, Dyer, James, Fulton, Byers, Harries Gillingham: Holy, O\u2019Beill, Zakuani, Ehmer, Ogilvie, Garmston, Byrne, Rees, Charles-Cook, Eaves, List Subs: Hadler, Fuller, Simpson, Parrett, Oldhaker, Hanlan, Parker Nothing quite screams magic of the cup like an all-Premier League tie between Newcastle and Watford but, do not fear, there are eight other semi-juicy fourth-round FA Cup matches to sink your teeth into before AFC Wimbledon take on West Ham United this evening. At least one of Doncaster or Oldham will join Bristol City and Manchester United in Monday\u2019s fifth-round draw, which will take place after non-league Barnet, the lowest-ranked team left in the competition, do battle with Brentford at the Hive. Before that we have plenty of fun and games, as we preside over Sam Ricketts taking on his former club, Wolverhampton Wanderers, in the dugout at Shrewsbury, plus Steve Lovell\u2019s return to Swansea, after knocking out Cardiff City in the previous round. Saturday\u2019s FA Cup fourth-round matches Brighton &amp; Hove Albion v West Bromwich Albion Doncaster Rovers v Oldham Athletic Manchester City v Burnley Middlesbrough v Newport County Newcastle United v Watford Portsmouth v Queens Park Rangers Shrewsbury Town v Wolverhampton Wanderers Swansea City v Gillingham Millwall v Everton, 5.30pm AFC Wimbledon v West Ham United, 7.45pm *all kick-off 3pm (GMT) unless specified",

Out went Aymeric Laporte, Raheem Sterling, Leroy San\u00e9 and Sergio Ag\u00fcero for John Stones, Riyad Mahrez, Kevin De Bruyne, and Gabriel Jesus. Sean Dyche retained only four from the goalless draw at Watford: Charlie Taylor, James Tarkowski, Jeff Hendrick and Dwight McNeil.</p> <p>Nick Pope was forced into action when Danilo let fly from 20 yards, the goalkeeper parrying the ball then clutching the rebound. City were yet not at their fluid best and Burnley sensed it. Fernandinho hashed a clearance and suddenly the ball was with Robbie Brady. He took aim but hit too high, and a chance was spurned.</p> <p>The scare jump-started City and soon Jesus registered. Taking the ball along the left, two shimmies rendered Kevin Long and Tarkowski statues before he smashed the ball home via a deflection off Pope. It perhaps offered a hint to the watching Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r of how Burnley might be breached by his Manchester United in Tuesday evening\u2019s league meeting.</p> <p>The visitors again had no answer when De Bruyne unpicked them with devilish vision. Taking the ball on the edge of Burnley\u2019s area he spied Bernardo Silva making a run along the blindside and picked him out with a chip that removed every defender from the equation. Apparently as surprised as anyone by the pass, the Portuguese was unable to capitalise.</p> <p>Seconds into the second half the Clarets wasted a golden opportunity to equalise. It derived from a clumsy touch by Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi that handed the ball to Matej Vydra. From here the Czech had a clear run at Ederson\u2019s goal but his shot found the side-netting.</p> <p>It caused Dyche to hop on the spot with frustration and for Fernandinho to have a word with Otamendi \u2013 surely to tell the centre-back to stop slumbering.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/26/middlesbrough-newport-county-fa-cup-match-report\">Matthew Dolan stuns Middlesbrough with late strike to earn Newport replay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>City as a whole soon perked up. In a swift move that began near the centre-circle Ilkay G\u00fcndogan found De Bruyne, who rolled the ball down the right channel to Bernardo Silva. He stepped inside, let fly and Pope could do nothing to stop Burnley\u2019s deficit doubling.</p> <p> Next a sharp cross from Kyle Walker was followed by Jesus shooting straight at Pope when really the score should have been 3-0. It soon was. City were suddenly in high gear. An Ederson pass picked out Mahrez and when the ball reached Danilo gliding into attack Burnley had a problem. The left-back found Bernardo Silva on the left, he passed infield to Mahrez, who in turn found De Bruyne and after a look up the midfielder placed a laser of a finish past Pope.</p> <p>Guardiola\u2019s reaction was to replace Fernandinho with David Silva: hardly what the visitors wished to see. Neither did they want to witness Kevin Long turning home Bernardo Silva\u2019s cross for 4-0. That was game over \u2013 a late Ag\u00fcero penalty rubbed salt in the wound \u2013 and the latest message that City are back to their best after a rocky December.</p> <p>Dyche summed it up neatly. \u201cThree keepers today would\u2019ve been handy,\u201d he quipped.</p>",

When witnessing such a display it seems odd to recall City\u2019s awful December, when they lost three times and ceded ground to Liverpool in their title defence. The five goals Guardiola\u2019s men put past Burnley took the combined scoreline of their last six outings to 28-0. \u201cOur eighth game in a row of winning,\u201d the manager said. \u201cI\u2019m most delighted that everyone has been involved.\u201d Guardiola made four changes from last Sunday\u2019s 3-0 Premier League win at Huddersfield Town. Out went Aymeric Laporte, Raheem Sterling, Leroy San\u00e9 and Sergio Ag\u00fcero for John Stones, Riyad Mahrez, Kevin De Bruyne, and Gabriel Jesus. Sean Dyche retained only four from the goalless draw at Watford: Charlie Taylor, James Tarkowski, Jeff Hendrick and Dwight McNeil. Nick Pope was forced into action when Danilo let fly from 20 yards, the goalkeeper parrying the ball then clutching the rebound. City were yet not at their fluid best and Burnley sensed it. Fernandinho hashed a clearance and suddenly the ball was with Robbie Brady. He took aim but hit too high, and a chance was spurned. The scare jump-started City and soon Jesus registered. Taking the ball along the left, two shimmies rendered Kevin Long and Tarkowski statues before he smashed the ball home via a deflection off Pope. It perhaps offered a hint to the watching Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r of how Burnley might be breached by his Manchester United in Tuesday evening\u2019s league meeting. The visitors again had no answer when De Bruyne unpicked them with devilish vision. Taking the ball on the edge of Burnley\u2019s area he spied Bernardo Silva making a run along the blindside and picked him out with a chip that removed every defender from the equation. Apparently as surprised as anyone by the pass, the Portuguese was unable to capitalise. Seconds into the second half the Clarets wasted a golden opportunity to equalise. It derived from a clumsy touch by Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi that handed the ball to Matej Vydra. From here the Czech had a clear run at Ederson\u2019s goal but his shot found the side-netting. It caused Dyche to hop on the spot with frustration and for Fernandinho to have a word with Otamendi \u2013 surely to tell the centre-back to stop slumbering. City as a whole soon perked up. In a swift move that began near the centre-circle Ilkay G\u00fcndogan found De Bruyne, who rolled the ball down the right channel to Bernardo Silva. He stepped inside, let fly and Pope could do nothing to stop Burnley\u2019s deficit doubling. Next a sharp cross from Kyle Walker was followed by Jesus shooting straight at Pope when really the score should have been 3-0. It soon was. City were suddenly in high gear. An Ederson pass picked out Mahrez and when the ball reached Danilo gliding into attack Burnley had a problem. The left-back found Bernardo Silva on the left, he passed infield to Mahrez, who in turn found De Bruyne and after a look up the midfielder placed a laser of a finish past Pope. Guardiola\u2019s reaction was to replace Fernandinho with David Silva: hardly what the visitors wished to see. Neither did they want to witness Kevin Long turning home Bernardo Silva\u2019s cross for 4-0. That was game over \u2013 a late Ag\u00fcero penalty rubbed salt in the wound \u2013 and the latest message that City are back to their best after a rocky December. Dyche summed it up neatly. \u201cThree keepers today would\u2019ve been handy,\u201d he quipped.",

My father, not a man overburdened with false modesty, was anxious for Hughie\u2019s approval to the end of his days. In the end, what will stay with me above all is my uncle\u2019s generosity of spirit. Though a stringent critic, and an issuer of brutally conclusive putdowns when he felt they were required (witness Messrs Bugner and Bruno), he was a great appreciator. Whether savouring a Shakespeare sonnet, or scrutinising a Messi free-kick, he retained a kind of boyish enthusiasm for the spectacle of things done well. As a man who brought his own rigorous standards to bear throughout 60 years of journalism, he was well placed to judge. Liam McIlvanney is an award-winning crime writer",

Stone, a longtime ally of Donald Trump and a notorious, self-declared political \u201cdirty trickster\u201d and Republican operative, was arrested in Fort Lauderdale early on Friday in a pre-dawn call by FBI agents armed with assault weapons and a warrant. Prosecutors say he lied about his pursuit of hacked emails damaging to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, according to the indictment. The US government says the emails were hacked by Russian intelligence officers, and they ended up being made public by WikiLeaks. In its most serious accusation from special counsel Robert Mueller, the indictment states that after WikiLeaks had begun releasing hacked Democratic emails, \u201ca senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information [WikiLeaks] had regarding the Clinton campaign\u201d. This direction was given to the unnamed senior Trump campaign official after 22 July 2016 \u2013 more than a month after it was reported that it was Russian government hackers who had broken into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer systems. Stone has maintained his innocence and has said he will plead not guilty. But he is just the latest in a string of senior Trump campaign or administration figures charged with serious crimes. Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort appeared in court in Washington on Friday for the latest hearing in his case, pre-sentencing. On Friday the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said the charges against Stone had \u201cnothing to do with the president\u201d but she would not answer whether Trump was the individual who ordered a senior campaign official to ask Stone about more dirt on the Clinton campaign. Later on Friday, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, fresh from her victory of conceding nothing on behalf of the Democrats before Trump ended the 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government over disagreement on funding for a wall on the border with Mexico, spoke up on the many Trump campaign allies who have now been charged or convicted of crimes. In a strongly worded and probing statement, Pelosi said: \u201cThe indictment of Roger Stone makes clear that there was a deliberate, coordinated attempt by top Trump campaign officials to influence the 2016 election and subvert the will of the American people \u2026 In the face of 37 indictments, the president\u2019s continued actions to undermine the special counsel investigation raise the questions: what does Putin have on the president, politically, personally or financially?\u201d In court on Friday, the judge told Stone he was to surrender his travel documents and that his movements would be curtailed, limited to any future court appearances in Florida, New York, Washington DC and Virginia.

      "bodyText": "Jean-Claude Juncker has told Theresa May in a private phone call that shifting her red lines in favour of a permanent customs union is the price she will need to pay for the EU revising the Irish backstop. Without a major shift in the prime minister\u2019s position, the European commission president told May that the current terms of the withdrawal agreement were non-negotiable. Details of the call, contained in a leaked diplomatic note, emerged as Juncker\u2019s deputy, Frans Timmermans, said there had been no weakening of the resolve in Brussels in support of Ireland, and accused the Tory Brexiters of a \u201ccavalier\u201d approach to peace. \u201cLet me be extremely clear: there is no way I could live in a situation where we throw Ireland under the bus,\u201d Timmermans said. \u201cAs far as the European commission is concerned, the backstop is an essential element for showing to Ireland and to the rest of Europe that we are in this together.\u201d On Tuesday, the Commons will vote on a series of amendments that might variously force the prime minister to delay Brexit or go back to Brussels to demand the ditching of the Irish backstop or a time limit on its enforcement. Critics of May\u2019s deal believe that the backstop, an \u201call-weather\u201d solution for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, could trap the UK in an indefinite customs union, limiting the country\u2019s ability to pursue an independent trade policy. May\u2019s deal was rejected this month by a historic 230 votes. At a confidential meeting of the ambassadors in Brussels last week, EU officials said there had been no back-channel talks in recent days with Downing Street nor talks between May and other heads of state and government. The European council\u2019s Danish secretary general, Jeppe Tranholm-Mikkelsen, told the ambassadors he believed the impasse could continue into February. \u201cNext week there is a vote,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been no talks in the last week. I do not expect any clarity or any position in the course of next week. This will take time. In the meantime, pressure will increase. On our end we will need to find ways to deal with that.\u201d A commission official said: \u201cYes, difficult, and President Juncker told Mrs May that the backstop was non-negotiable and only if May changed red lines then we can move on the backstop.\u201d It is understood that one solution discussed by senior officials would be for the backstop to be downgraded to be Northern Ireland specific, as was originally proposed by the EU, should there be a commitment from the British government to negotiate a permanent customs union with the whole of the UK.

Susy had no urge to change the structure of the house, which is largely Georgian with a Tudor core. So no knocking through or ripping out has gone on. \u201cWe wanted to keep the \u2018bones\u2019 of the house exactly as they were, but I could still imagine the rooms having a very different feel,\u201d she says.

She says it was more about tapping into an existing atmosphere, particularly in the hallway and neighbouring breakfast room. With low beams, small doorways and a large inglenook fireplace at the end of the hall, these rooms are at the house\u2019s Tudor heart. \u201cThis part is quite inward-looking, with thick-walled rooms that centre around the fire, and warren-like corridors,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"395ebc7d4c4dd25d00d2afa928ddfd91e9aaeb87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/395ebc7d4c4dd25d00d2afa928ddfd91e9aaeb87/0_2226_6060_3636/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jungle-leaf pattern wallpaper and chandelier in the top-floor bedroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dramatic touch: jungle-leaf pattern wallpaper and chandelier in the top-floor bedroom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later Georgian additions also have their appeal, including a \u201csecret\u201d back staircase for servants that is hidden behind a panelled door in the kitchen. \u201cI liked that the house felt quite mysterious, as if it held its own secrets.\u201d</p> <p>When they moved in, the kitchen style owed more to the 1980s than to its Georgian roots. But it seemed wasteful to rip it all out, so the couple adapted what was in situ. \u201cWe added a wall cabinet, repainted the base units black and replaced the pine worktops with granite.\u201d She did, however, swap a wall of illustrative wall tiles for glazed versions by <a href=\"https://www.bertandmay.com/\" title=\"\">Bert &amp; May</a>, adding a dazzle of triangles in a near-luminous green. \u201cI wanted a pattern with impact.\u201d</p> <p>A fringed oversized lampshade by <a href=\"https://www.annahaymandesigns.com/\" title=\"\">Anna Hayman</a> helps pull the green, black and gold kitchen scheme together. \u201cI tend to pick out one element I really like and use it as a basis for the rest of the room. Once you\u2019ve decided on a key item, the rest falls more easily into place,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>Similarly, the star of the dining room \u2013 previously used as a study \u2013 is a run of antiqued mirror glass along one wall, supplied by a company that usually fits out larger commercial buildings. \u201cThe night before it came I worried it would look like a day spa, but the effect is just what I\u2019d hoped for. The smoky, tinted glass brings out the gold tones in the wood, and reflects the Holophane glass pendants.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2170b446cfaa50cf25c5c3b57f2e41b4902533ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2170b446cfaa50cf25c5c3b57f2e41b4902533ea/0_3128_6706_4024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bright fabrics displayed in an old cabinet in the hallway.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colour splash: bright fabrics are displayed in an old cabinet in the hallway.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The room that has changed the least is Darcy\u2019s bedroom, which came with a gently faded William Morris chrysanthemum wallpaper. \u2018\u201cI remember getting lost in wallpaper patterns like that as a child, so I knew I wanted to keep it,\u2019\u201d she says. Vintage pictures and a frou-frou pink lampshade that was found at the back of a junk shop add to the nostalgic mood.</p> <p>There are plenty of other old prints and paintings dotted around, which add to the atmosphere, and many were bought locally. \u201cThe Dartmoor towns of Chagford and Ashburton are rummage-heaven,\u201d says Susy. \u201cI always look out for pictures that have character.\u201d</p> <p>A still life that hangs in the hallway is a case in point: \u201cIt\u2019s not even that old. We reckon it was probably done by an art student, as you can see where they redid some bits. But I love that it comes with its own story.\u201d</p> <p>In London, Susy co-founded the clothing company <a href=\"https://foxinaglove.com/\" title=\"\">Fox in a Glove</a>, but now works as an interior designer, also selling vintage finds at <a href=\"https://piperandpoet.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Piper &amp; Poet</a>. \u201cWhat excites me about interiors is the endless scope for creative play and adding layers to a room,\u201d she says. \u201cI have a feeling that our house will carry on evolving.\u201d</p>",

Later Georgian additions also have their appeal, including a \u201csecret\u201d back staircase for servants that is hidden behind a panelled door in the kitchen. \u201cI liked that the house felt quite mysterious, as if it held its own secrets.\u201d When they moved in, the kitchen style owed more to the 1980s than to its Georgian roots. But it seemed wasteful to rip it all out, so the couple adapted what was in situ. \u201cWe added a wall cabinet, repainted the base units black and replaced the pine worktops with granite.\u201d She did, however, swap a wall of illustrative wall tiles for glazed versions by Bert &amp; May, adding a dazzle of triangles in a near-luminous green. \u201cI wanted a pattern with impact.\u201d A fringed oversized lampshade by Anna Hayman helps pull the green, black and gold kitchen scheme together. \u201cI tend to pick out one element I really like and use it as a basis for the rest of the room. Once you\u2019ve decided on a key item, the rest falls more easily into place,\u201d she adds. Similarly, the star of the dining room \u2013 previously used as a study \u2013 is a run of antiqued mirror glass along one wall, supplied by a company that usually fits out larger commercial buildings. \u201cThe night before it came I worried it would look like a day spa, but the effect is just what I\u2019d hoped for. The smoky, tinted glass brings out the gold tones in the wood, and reflects the Holophane glass pendants.\u201d The room that has changed the least is Darcy\u2019s bedroom, which came with a gently faded William Morris chrysanthemum wallpaper. \u2018\u201cI remember getting lost in wallpaper patterns like that as a child, so I knew I wanted to keep it,\u2019\u201d she says. Vintage pictures and a frou-frou pink lampshade that was found at the back of a junk shop add to the nostalgic mood. There are plenty of other old prints and paintings dotted around, which add to the atmosphere, and many were bought locally. \u201cThe Dartmoor towns of Chagford and Ashburton are rummage-heaven,\u201d says Susy. \u201cI always look out for pictures that have character.\u201d A still life that hangs in the hallway is a case in point: \u201cIt\u2019s not even that old. We reckon it was probably done by an art student, as you can see where they redid some bits. But I love that it comes with its own story.\u201d In London, Susy co-founded the clothing company Fox in a Glove, but now works as an interior designer, also selling vintage finds at Piper &amp; Poet. \u201cWhat excites me about interiors is the endless scope for creative play and adding layers to a room,\u201d she says. \u201cI have a feeling that our house will carry on evolving.\u201d",

This was more than just designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro. They proposed the entire cultural and architectural concept, in the economically unpromising year of 2008, in response to a call for ideas from the then mayor Michael Bloomberg. They then pushed it and argued for it, unfunded, kept going by what Diller calls \u201csheer will\u201d, until Bloomberg and his administration gave the project the financial and organisational support it needed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"461949a6e090b9b24007a008bdc2bb975d685a9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/461949a6e090b9b24007a008bdc2bb975d685a9a/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The High Line, New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New York\u2019s hugely popular High Line.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Iwan Baan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Shed would not have happened without the High Line, which, as Diller recalls, started as a \u201cground-up\u201d initiative by locals, led by \u201ctwo young guys who just figured out how to make it happen\u201d. Its phenomenal success \u2013 8 million or more visitors a year, compared with an expected 400,000 \u2013 gave political confidence that public projects could work in this location and that Diller and her colleagues could deliver them. The High Line also raised property values \u2013 \u00a3110m ($144m) in public investment produced \u00a33.9bn ($5bn) in real-estate investment around it \u2013 which in turn sprinkled the magic spores that helped a gigantic but stalled development called <a href=\"https://www.hudsonyardsnewyork.com/\" title=\"\">Hudson Yards</a> to start mushrooming. Hudson Yards, described by its promoters as the largest of its kind in the United States, surrounds the site of the Shed. In the pushing and pulling of developers and city, the location of the as yet unbuilt arts centre got shunted and rotated until it backed on to the site of a proposed luxury residential skyscraper, which DS+R were then asked to design.</p> <p>They agreed, after taking advice \u201cof great intelligence\u201d from sources Diller doesn\u2019t name. Even though \u201cit was not in our wheelhouse\u201d to design such a thing, it would put them in a position of greater influence in the politics of the site. The Shed would also gain 10 storeys of back-of-house space located in the lower section of the tower; the developers would compensate themselves for this loss of valuable floorspace by adding floors at the top, where it is worth more. Which is why they now have a 1,000ft tower to their name, mating curiously at its base with the rear of the Shed, sold with the kind of talk \u2013 a reception \u201caccented with unique works of art, a calming reflecting pool and elegant walls of travertine\u201d \u2013 that <em>Soft Sell</em> once mocked.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4bb5459d5ee86107716b159cce7f64269ca6b1f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bb5459d5ee86107716b159cce7f64269ca6b1f6/0_0_3075_2810/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior design concept for London\u2019s Centre for Music\" width=\"1000\" height=\"914\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Exterior design concept for London\u2019s Centre for Music, \u2018the great nest of the auditorium raised up within a twisted tower, such that daylight can be admitted to rehearsing orchestras\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Diller Scofidio + Renfro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In London, the <a href=\"https://www.culturemile.london/centreformusic/\" title=\"\">Centre for Music</a> has its own entanglements of culture and finance. It is planned to be built in the City of London, attached to the south-west corner of the Barbican estate, on a site where the Museum of London (which will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/feb/23/smithfield-market-public-inquiry-redevelopment-rowan-moore\" title=\"\">relocating to Smithfield Market</a>) now stands. At least part of its role is to reinforce the attraction of the Square Mile, threatened as it may be by Brexit, as a \u201cworld-class\u201d \u2013 as the rhetoric always has it \u2013 place to do business. Part of the project brief is several floors of commercial office space, to help pay for the running costs.</p> <p>At its launch last week the leaders of the project showered it with an alphabet of desirables: it will be an anchor, a beacon, a connection (or catalyst), dynamic (also digital and diverse), educational, first-class, galvanising, of the highest level, inspiring and so on. These terms are all well and good, but could equally describe a bland exercise in corporate mutual shoulder-patting or genuinely what Diller calls \u201ca dynamic place of exchange\u201d, where the magic of music and the life of the surrounding city enrich each other.</p> <p>The sketches look promising. The great nest of the auditorium is raised up within a twisted tower, such that daylight can be admitted to rehearsing orchestras, and a panoramic view can be had from its upper level over the City\u2019s roofs. There is none of the claustrophobic, buried feeling you get in many concert halls. Beneath it, a multi-levelled foyer connects a newly pedestrianised area of street with the Barbican\u2019s elevated walkways. What is currently an embattled corner of London, where heavy masonry is besieged by traffic, will be opened up and made habitable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d85c8f7700f3750b68cb979d70e21dfee7204c94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d85c8f7700f3750b68cb979d70e21dfee7204c94/0_90_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plans for the foyer of London\u2019s Centre for Music.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plans for the foyer of London\u2019s Centre for Music.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Diller Scofidio + Renfro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The key will be in the detail, and in the moods it makes. The escalatored foyers shown could become mall-like if they are designed in a generic way. The relationship to the rest of the grey concrete beast of the Barbican, increasingly loved for its curmudgeonly magnificence, will also be crucial. The new building will necessarily be different but must also have a rapport with the old.</p> <p>The word that unifies DS+R\u2019s output is performance. It\u2019s in their early installations and in the Mile-Long Opera. It\u2019s in their proposals for the Centre for Music, which can best be seen as the overlapping of many performances by both public and musicians. But it is also in the moves they make \u2013 their manoeuvres with mayors, developers and media \u2013 to get what they want and what they think is good for cities. Which, given the way the world works, is possibly fundamental to getting anything worthwhile done.</p>",

The Shed would not have happened without the High Line, which, as Diller recalls, started as a \u201cground-up\u201d initiative by locals, led by \u201ctwo young guys who just figured out how to make it happen\u201d. Its phenomenal success \u2013 8 million or more visitors a year, compared with an expected 400,000 \u2013 gave political confidence that public projects could work in this location and that Diller and her colleagues could deliver them. The High Line also raised property values \u2013 \u00a3110m ($144m) in public investment produced \u00a33.9bn ($5bn) in real-estate investment around it \u2013 which in turn sprinkled the magic spores that helped a gigantic but stalled development called Hudson Yards to start mushrooming. Hudson Yards, described by its promoters as the largest of its kind in the United States, surrounds the site of the Shed. In the pushing and pulling of developers and city, the location of the as yet unbuilt arts centre got shunted and rotated until it backed on to the site of a proposed luxury residential skyscraper, which DS+R were then asked to design. They agreed, after taking advice \u201cof great intelligence\u201d from sources Diller doesn\u2019t name. Even though \u201cit was not in our wheelhouse\u201d to design such a thing, it would put them in a position of greater influence in the politics of the site. The Shed would also gain 10 storeys of back-of-house space located in the lower section of the tower; the developers would compensate themselves for this loss of valuable floorspace by adding floors at the top, where it is worth more. Which is why they now have a 1,000ft tower to their name, mating curiously at its base with the rear of the Shed, sold with the kind of talk \u2013 a reception \u201caccented with unique works of art, a calming reflecting pool and elegant walls of travertine\u201d \u2013 that Soft Sell once mocked. In London, the Centre for Music has its own entanglements of culture and finance. It is planned to be built in the City of London, attached to the south-west corner of the Barbican estate, on a site where the Museum of London (which will be relocating to Smithfield Market) now stands. At least part of its role is to reinforce the attraction of the Square Mile, threatened as it may be by Brexit, as a \u201cworld-class\u201d \u2013 as the rhetoric always has it \u2013 place to do business. Part of the project brief is several floors of commercial office space, to help pay for the running costs. At its launch last week the leaders of the project showered it with an alphabet of desirables: it will be an anchor, a beacon, a connection (or catalyst), dynamic (also digital and diverse), educational, first-class, galvanising, of the highest level, inspiring and so on. These terms are all well and good, but could equally describe a bland exercise in corporate mutual shoulder-patting or genuinely what Diller calls \u201ca dynamic place of exchange\u201d, where the magic of music and the life of the surrounding city enrich each other. The sketches look promising. The great nest of the auditorium is raised up within a twisted tower, such that daylight can be admitted to rehearsing orchestras, and a panoramic view can be had from its upper level over the City\u2019s roofs. There is none of the claustrophobic, buried feeling you get in many concert halls. Beneath it, a multi-levelled foyer connects a newly pedestrianised area of street with the Barbican\u2019s elevated walkways. What is currently an embattled corner of London, where heavy masonry is besieged by traffic, will be opened up and made habitable. The key will be in the detail, and in the moods it makes. The escalatored foyers shown could become mall-like if they are designed in a generic way. The relationship to the rest of the grey concrete beast of the Barbican, increasingly loved for its curmudgeonly magnificence, will also be crucial. The new building will necessarily be different but must also have a rapport with the old. The word that unifies DS+R\u2019s output is performance. It\u2019s in their early installations and in the Mile-Long Opera. It\u2019s in their proposals for the Centre for Music, which can best be seen as the overlapping of many performances by both public and musicians. But it is also in the moves they make \u2013 their manoeuvres with mayors, developers and media \u2013 to get what they want and what they think is good for cities. Which, given the way the world works, is possibly fundamental to getting anything worthwhile done.",

It is a typical mid-morning at the supermarket in this former industrial town, 12 miles north of Swansea. Young mothers browse the knitwear section at George by Asda; a couple of older men in paint-speckled work overalls scour the sandwich section for their lunch. It looks much like every other Asda in the country. But this site is owned by Mole Valley district council \u2013 in Dorking, Surrey. The council bought it for \u00a311.5m and receives an annual rental income of \u00a3599,450. Asda has a lease with the council until 2037. The proceeds from Asda \u2013 \u201csaving you money every day\u201d \u2013 are used to pay for key council services, such as bin collection and community and leisure centres, 200 miles away. Dave Keane, a retired police officer shopping at the supermarket, said: \u201cI would prefer it to be owned by the local council, Neath Port Talbot.

Industry watchers predict there are more failures to come.</p> <p>The string of collapses has shone a spotlight on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/14/sse-bulb-energy-firms-low-prices-uk\" title=\"\">unsustainable pricing by new entrants</a> and on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/dec/16/uk-householders-pick-up-bill-for-bust-energy-firms\" title=\"\">costs all households face from picking up the pieces</a>. What is less remarked upon is how the events have redrawn the landscape of the energy sector.</p> <p>Suppliers who have had to take on more than 800,000 displaced customers have received a huge boost to their growth, posing a serious threat to the dominance of the market\u2019s \u201cbig six\u201d suppliers \u2013 British Gas, EDF, E.ON, npower, ScottishPower and SSE \u2013 which control four-fifths of the market.</p> <p>While bodies such as energy regulator Ofgem and trade group Energy UK have lauded the entrance of new players as a sign of healthy competition \u2013 taking the number of suppliers to more than 70 at one point \u2013 until recently few have seriously begun to rival the big six for scale.</p> <p>The closest to bridging the gap is a trio of medium-sized firms: Ovo Energy, First Utility and Bulb.</p> <p>Ovo has made the bold gambit of taking on half a million customers from the failed companies, taking it to 1.5 million and a market share of 4.9%. That puts it within touching distance of npower\u2019s 7.7%, according to data from energy market analysts Cornwall Insight.</p> <p>Robert Buckley at Cornwall Insight said consolidation had redrawn the market. \u201cThere has been a lot of negative press surrounding the exits, focusing on fragile business models, and rightly so. However, currently there are no signs that these exits have caused any real degradation to competition in the retail market.</p> <p>\u201cThe shake-up has presented an opportunity for several suppliers to grow, changing the face of the retail landscape in the process.\u201d</p> <p>Ovo, which launched a decade ago, said it would consider taking on more displaced customers if more companies fold. \u201cTaking on Economy Energy and Spark Energy customers has been significant for us \u2013 an increase of more than 500,000 customers \u2013 but we are prepared for more if the right opportunities arise,\u201d said Stephen Fitzpatrick, Ovo\u2019s chief executive.</p> <p>He said the company had been disciplined with its pricing and had chosen to avoid a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d with loss-leading tariffs.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the last few months have shown is that it\u2019s not just about getting bigger fast. We\u2019ve already seen some of the larger independent energy companies fail \u2013 the market is going through major change and many companies, big and small, are struggling to adapt,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2019-01-24T16:26:03/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Challenger firms versus big six market share\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2019-01-24T16:26:03/embed.html\">Challenger firms versus big six market share</a> </figure>  <p>Bulb, by contrast, has not taken on any displaced customers, but has grown fast since its launch in 2015. The company added 700,000 customers last year, taking its market share to 3.1%, and is now on the verge of passing 1 million clients.</p> <p>Hayden Wood, the company\u2019s founder, said there was a \u201cnext generation\u201d of suppliers who could close the gap to the big six within a few years. Consumers were switching to those newer challengers because of price and service, he said, pointing to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/21/record-numbers-switched-energy-provider-last-year-amid-price-hikes\" title=\"\">record 5 million-plus households who switched last year</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t see any reason why this trend wouldn\u2019t continue. We do see this gap with the big six closing: it\u2019s just a matter of time. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of months \u2013 I would be aiming for two to three years.\u201d</p> <p>First Utility, which launched in 2008, is the third-biggest challenger, with about 760,000 customers. It was bought by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/21/shell-to-supply-energy-to-uk-households-after-takeover-of-first-utility\" title=\"\">oil company Shell in 2017</a>, since when it has actually shed tens of thousands of customers. The oil giant has said, however, it wants the supplier to \u201cgrow significantly\u201d.</p> <p>While challenger firms have used the failure of their peers to grow quickly, there is a question over how many of those customers will stick around. Co-op Energy swelled to more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/02/co-op-energy-chief-david-bird-more-small-suppliers-could-go-bust\" title=\"\">410,000 customers</a> after it took on 160,000 from a collapsed company in 2016, but that figure has since dropped to around 372,000.</p> <p>Whether or not more collapses and consolidation help challenger firms close the gap, one thing is clear \u2013 all households will have to pick up the bill for failures. Cornwall Insight estimates more than \u00a36 will be added to every consumer\u2019s annual dual-fuel bill, because of the costs of appointing new suppliers and spreading out the cost of firms\u2019 missed renewable energy payments.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Eight small energy suppliers closed their doors last year as rising wholesale costs tipped them over the edge, and the trend has continued into 2019, with the recent insolvency of Economy Energy, followed by Our Power, which failed on Friday. Industry watchers predict there are more failures to come. The string of collapses has shone a spotlight on unsustainable pricing by new entrants and on the costs all households face from picking up the pieces. What is less remarked upon is how the events have redrawn the landscape of the energy sector. Suppliers who have had to take on more than 800,000 displaced customers have received a huge boost to their growth, posing a serious threat to the dominance of the market\u2019s \u201cbig six\u201d suppliers \u2013 British Gas, EDF, E.ON, npower, ScottishPower and SSE \u2013 which control four-fifths of the market. While bodies such as energy regulator Ofgem and trade group Energy UK have lauded the entrance of new players as a sign of healthy competition \u2013 taking the number of suppliers to more than 70 at one point \u2013 until recently few have seriously begun to rival the big six for scale. The closest to bridging the gap is a trio of medium-sized firms: Ovo Energy, First Utility and Bulb. Ovo has made the bold gambit of taking on half a million customers from the failed companies, taking it to 1.5 million and a market share of 4.9%. That puts it within touching distance of npower\u2019s 7.7%, according to data from energy market analysts Cornwall Insight. Robert Buckley at Cornwall Insight said consolidation had redrawn the market. \u201cThere has been a lot of negative press surrounding the exits, focusing on fragile business models, and rightly so. However, currently there are no signs that these exits have caused any real degradation to competition in the retail market. \u201cThe shake-up has presented an opportunity for several suppliers to grow, changing the face of the retail landscape in the process.\u201d Ovo, which launched a decade ago, said it would consider taking on more displaced customers if more companies fold. \u201cTaking on Economy Energy and Spark Energy customers has been significant for us \u2013 an increase of more than 500,000 customers \u2013 but we are prepared for more if the right opportunities arise,\u201d said Stephen Fitzpatrick, Ovo\u2019s chief executive. He said the company had been disciplined with its pricing and had chosen to avoid a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d with loss-leading tariffs. \u201cWhat the last few months have shown is that it\u2019s not just about getting bigger fast. We\u2019ve already seen some of the larger independent energy companies fail \u2013 the market is going through major change and many companies, big and small, are struggling to adapt,\u201d he said. Bulb, by contrast, has not taken on any displaced customers, but has grown fast since its launch in 2015. The company added 700,000 customers last year, taking its market share to 3.1%, and is now on the verge of passing 1 million clients. Hayden Wood, the company\u2019s founder, said there was a \u201cnext generation\u201d of suppliers who could close the gap to the big six within a few years. Consumers were switching to those newer challengers because of price and service, he said, pointing to the record 5 million-plus households who switched last year. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any reason why this trend wouldn\u2019t continue. We do see this gap with the big six closing: it\u2019s just a matter of time. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of months \u2013 I would be aiming for two to three years.\u201d First Utility, which launched in 2008, is the third-biggest challenger, with about 760,000 customers. It was bought by oil company Shell in 2017, since when it has actually shed tens of thousands of customers. The oil giant has said, however, it wants the supplier to \u201cgrow significantly\u201d. While challenger firms have used the failure of their peers to grow quickly, there is a question over how many of those customers will stick around. Co-op Energy swelled to more than 410,000 customers after it took on 160,000 from a collapsed company in 2016, but that figure has since dropped to around 372,000. Whether or not more collapses and consolidation help challenger firms close the gap, one thing is clear \u2013 all households will have to pick up the bill for failures. Cornwall Insight estimates more than \u00a36 will be added to every consumer\u2019s annual dual-fuel bill, because of the costs of appointing new suppliers and spreading out the cost of firms\u2019 missed renewable energy payments.",

      "bodyText": "It was reasonable, I think, to have held at least a middling degree of hope that this year\u2019s Oscar nominations might lean towards recognising the best films released over the last 12 months, although this belief in the meritocracy of awards ceremonies might explain why I find it so easy to escape into cinematic make-believe. With a handful of exceptions \u2013 I adored The Favourite (more than the couple who sat behind me when I saw it, who must have been expecting a more straightforward historical drama and tutted loudly and disgustedly at every swearword), Black Panther is a deserving best picture contender and Spike Lee\u2019s best director nod for BlacKKKlansman is, bizarrely, his first \u2013 it is a bland bunch of predictably just-so films. There were only eight nominations for best picture, which, considering that the upper limit allowed is 10, makes it even stranger that no films directed by women were considered worthy of inclusion (there were no women nominated for directing, cinematography, editing, composing or visual effects, either). Typically, people make the point that there simply aren\u2019t as many female directors, for example, and while that\u2019s a whole different set of circumstances to unpick, there were a number of films that were simply better, by far, than Green Book or Bohemian Rhapsody. The fact that the Academy could find no room to acknowledge Lynne Ramsay for You Were Never Really Here, Marielle Heller for Can You Ever Forgive Me? or Debra Granik for Leave No Trace, which was one of the most beautiful and moving pieces of film-making I\u2019ve seen in recent years, is unfathomable. The actor and writer Amber Tamblyn, who has been heavily involved in the Time\u2019s Up and #MeToo movements, wrote a piece for the Cut last week attempting to fathom it. She said that, as the daughter of an Academy member, the actor Russ Tamblyn, she was used to going to screenings: \u201cBut when I looked around at the Academy audience, I rarely ever saw any members who were women and I almost never saw members who were women of colour.\u201d She calls it \u201ca long-term cycle of trickle-down sexism\u201d that is stuck in a way of thinking that believes women don\u2019t win awards, therefore they don\u2019t deserve to win awards. Clearly a new way is needed, a break in the cycle. It may not be this year, but Tamblyn, who has recently been made a voting member, is optimistic that change, if slow, is on its way. Bebe Rexha: who says size doesn\u2019t matter? In a video posted to Instagram, the singer Bebe Rexha has revealed that she has struggled to get designers to lend her a dress for the forthcoming Grammy awards, because, as a US size 6-8 (a UK 10-12), she is considered to be \u201ctoo big\u201d. She added a few expletives to inform these designers that she would no longer wish to wear their dresses anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy; you\u2019re saying all the women in the world that are size eight and up are not beautiful and they cannot wear your dresses,\u201d she said. Rexha is nominated for two awards, so even if she doesn\u2019t win she\u2019s likely to appear on camera, the red carpet, in newspapers and on websites around the world. The fact that she\u2019s considered to be unwelcome even as a free walking advertisement illustrates the extent of the madness when it comes to what women\u2019s bodies are supposed to look like. Naturally, this all had a happy ending, with swaths of more canny designers offering to dress the singer, gaining publicity amid the golden glow of doing the right thing. And as Rexha said in the caption to her original post: \u201cAnddddd My size 8 ass is still going to the Grammys. #LOVEYOURBODY.\u201d Ncuti Gatwa: an eloquent star is born in Sex Education In the mid-90s, My So-Called Life was essential viewing. The teen drama turned Claire Danes into a star and captured the intense awkwardness of adolescence \u2013 a pressing concern for me then \u2013 with an excruciatingly keen eye.

I spent a weekend binge-watching it and, once it settled into its over-the-top charms, I found it to be warm and genuine, hitting a sweet spot in its halfway land between US high-school movies and the bluntness and self-deprecation of British humour. There are many candidates for most valuable player \u2013 Gillian Anderson\u2019s glamorous sex therapist mother, bookish rebel girl Maeve and the effortlessly ditsy Aimee, but it was Eric who grabbed me and wouldn\u2019t let go.

Teen drama requires a tricky balancing act \u2013 Sex Education\u2019s earnest stablemate 13 Reasons Why is a good example of how it can go wrong\u2013 but I\u2019d go and see Hedwig with Eric any day. \u2022 Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>With his last film, The Big Short, Adam McKay achieved the near-impossible: he made a fizzingly entertaining movie about mortgages. Buoyed by this success, he set himself another formidable challenge, this time to craft a revealing portrait of a man who habitually revealed nothing: ruthlessly ambitious political animal and former US vice-president Dick Cheney (Christian Bale). But as numerous colleagues and opponents would no doubt concur, Cheney is a tricky man to pin down.</p> <p>With no other option available \u2013 Cheney was as scrupulous in covering his tracks as he was calculating in his power grab \u2013 McKay makes a virtue of the known unknowns of this slice of US political history. Winking over the fourth wall in acknowledgement that the true facts of certain encounters will never be known, the screenplay then propels the film off into comic fantasy \u2013 Cheney and his wife, Lynne (a chillingly chipper Amy Adams), speak in faux-Shakespearean verse at one point; a fake set of closing titles roll at another.</p> <p>It\u2019s an ambitious piece of writing, certainly, springy with ideas and information. But whereas the screenplay for <em>The Big Short</em>, which McKay co-wrote with Charles Randolph, deftly negotiated the dense, often very dry material, here there is a slightly frantic top note to McKay\u2019s trademark wryly satirical tone.</p> <p>This is increasingly evident later in the picture. There are moments in the third act that feel like a panicked exam paper \u2013 all blurted facts and the thread of the argument long lost.</p> <p>Under a doughy layer of prosthetics that make him look like a malevolent potato, Bale is physically transformed for the role. Even so, McKay often chooses to shroud his face in darkness. Cheney, he suggests, is a man who operated most comfortably in the shadows. Likewise, the director has fun with Cheney\u2019s fondness for fly fishing, dropping shots of lurking pike and catfish into the movie like lures. It\u2019s a piece of symbolism that is telegraphed perhaps a little too obviously: Cheney is a slippery fish.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHZWxKRQhTw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aHZWxKRQhTw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHZWxKRQhTw\">Watch a trailer for Vice.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>But what of Bale\u2019s performance, which received one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/22/oscars-2019-roma-and-the-favourite-vying-for-glory-with-10-nominations-each\" title=\"\">the film\u2019s eight Oscar nominations</a> last week? The voice, with its smooth edges and dangerous authority, is spot on. Bale peppers his delivery with unexpected mid-sentence pauses that hang there, as empty and ominous as a hangman\u2019s noose. There\u2019s something of the mafia don in Bale\u2019s take on Cheney: the impassive Corleone bulk; that curt, life-ruining nod of dismissal. But there are also moments, mined for humour, when the performance tips over into cartoon villain territory. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/08/satan-christian-bale-dick-cheney-golden-globes\" title=\"\">Bale credited \u201cSatan\u201d for inspiration for the role,</a> and it shows. Sam Rockwell\u2019s wicked impersonation of George W Bush, positioned here as a comic foil, is also Oscar-nominated; however, amusing as the performance is, I found it a little one-note.</p> <p>A more serious complaint is an initially glib, sarcastic spin on the story that is at odds with an ending that loosely ties Cheney\u2019s tenure to pretty much everything that\u2019s currently wrong with the world. A final barrage of images of environmental catastrophe, migrant tragedy, civil unrest and more sends the film swerving into a much darker place. It\u2019s almost as if McKay talked himself into a 180-degree pivot, and finally realised that Dick Cheney is no laughing matter after all.</p>",

This is increasingly evident later in the picture. There are moments in the third act that feel like a panicked exam paper \u2013 all blurted facts and the thread of the argument long lost. Under a doughy layer of prosthetics that make him look like a malevolent potato, Bale is physically transformed for the role. Even so, McKay often chooses to shroud his face in darkness. Cheney, he suggests, is a man who operated most comfortably in the shadows. Likewise, the director has fun with Cheney\u2019s fondness for fly fishing, dropping shots of lurking pike and catfish into the movie like lures. It\u2019s a piece of symbolism that is telegraphed perhaps a little too obviously: Cheney is a slippery fish. But what of Bale\u2019s performance, which received one of the film\u2019s eight Oscar nominations last week? The voice, with its smooth edges and dangerous authority, is spot on. Bale peppers his delivery with unexpected mid-sentence pauses that hang there, as empty and ominous as a hangman\u2019s noose. There\u2019s something of the mafia don in Bale\u2019s take on Cheney: the impassive Corleone bulk; that curt, life-ruining nod of dismissal. But there are also moments, mined for humour, when the performance tips over into cartoon villain territory. Bale credited \u201cSatan\u201d for inspiration for the role, and it shows. Sam Rockwell\u2019s wicked impersonation of George W Bush, positioned here as a comic foil, is also Oscar-nominated; however, amusing as the performance is, I found it a little one-note. A more serious complaint is an initially glib, sarcastic spin on the story that is at odds with an ending that loosely ties Cheney\u2019s tenure to pretty much everything that\u2019s currently wrong with the world. A final barrage of images of environmental catastrophe, migrant tragedy, civil unrest and more sends the film swerving into a much darker place. It\u2019s almost as if McKay talked himself into a 180-degree pivot, and finally realised that Dick Cheney is no laughing matter after all.",

      "body": "<p>Born in Sacramento, California, in 1985, Alex Honnold is one of the greatest rock climbers of all time. In June 2017 he became the first person to climb the famous El Capitan, a sheer 3,000ft rockface in Yosemite national park, without ropes or protective equipment of any kind, a style of climbing known as free soloing. This feat, which took him just three hours and 56 minutes, is the subject of the 2018 documentary <em>Free Solo</em>, which has been nominated for best documentary at both the Oscars and Baftas.</p> <p><strong>In the film, you describe free soloing as a low-risk, high-consequence pursuit \u2013 you\u2019re confident you won\u2019t make a mistake, but if you do you die. Why do you do it?</strong><br>There are a lot of things about soloing that are fun. It\u2019s faster and more free. You don\u2019t have all the weight hanging off you \u2013 a rope weighs at least 10 pounds. Apart from that it just feels incredible, and that goes hand in hand with the challenge of it. And for me there\u2019s certainly a component of doing things that have never been done before and feeling like I\u2019m making my mark on climbing.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s important about El Capitan?</strong><br>It\u2019s the most inspiring wall in every possible way. It was bigger and more difficult than anything I\u2019ve ever done. But was free soloing it possible? There are just so many places where, if you weight your foot incorrectly, you\u2019ll slip and fall to your death. But when I thought about it rationally and broke it down into pieces, I thought it should be possible.</p> <p><strong>Did you have any qualms about letting yourself be filmed?</strong><br>I don\u2019t know about serious doubts. In the film, [fellow climber] Peter Croft talks about making sure you\u2019re climbing for the right reasons, not being pressured by anything external. But the whole thing was really in secret. My close personal friends knew what was going on, and obviously my girlfriend, Sanni, did, but otherwise nobody really knew.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81f32fa13d63f4a50238422aa55b358ca2afc409\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81f32fa13d63f4a50238422aa55b358ca2afc409/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Honnold holds all of his climbing gear on the summit of El Capitan after becoming the first person to climb it without a rope.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Honnold holds all of his climbing gear on the summit of El Capitan after becoming the first person to climb it without a rope.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jimmy Chin/National Geographic/Jimmy Chin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>I found the film incredibly nerve-</strong><strong>racking to watch, even though I knew you survived</strong><strong>.

I knew exactly how I felt on the day, but for the camera crew, all they could do was suppress their personal emotions and see how it unfolded. They did remarkably well in staying emotionally neutral. Because my mental state, when I\u2019m getting ready for a climb, is such a fragile thing, you don\u2019t want the camera crew bursting into tears every time they see you. At the same time you don\u2019t want them to be encouraging you to do something you\u2019re not ready to do. It\u2019s a really delicate line.</p> <p><strong>Do you ever wish you could find another pursuit that\u2019s equally fulfilling but more forgiving of error?</strong><br>Not so far. I think that\u2019ll probably naturally happen. Already there are certain types of dangerous climbing that I\u2019m less interested in than I was 10 years ago. And I imagine if I had a family, things might change.</p> <p><strong>What was your reaction when you first saw the film?</strong><br>Well in some ways I\u2019d known what the film was going to be, because I\u2019d been shooting it for two years and I knew what they\u2019d filmed. On the other hand, I had no idea because I\u2019d seen none of the footage, none of the photos. When I saw it I was like: \u201cOh yeah, it\u2019s a really good film\u201d, but I didn\u2019t know how much it would affect people until I actually saw it with a full audience. It\u2019s awesome. I love seeing people covering their eyes and shying away.</p> <p><strong>Has Hollywood ever produced a decent climbing movie?</strong><br>If by decent you mean realistic, then not really. But I really like [the 1993 Sylvester Stallone film] <em>Cliffhanger</em>, even though it\u2019s really over the top. And the sequence in <em>Mission: Impossible 2</em> that opens with Tom Cruise soloing \u2013 I\u2019ve watched that scene like 100 times, it\u2019s totally unrealistic, but I was so into it.

      "body": "<p>Charly Cox is explaining why she thinks her poetry is so popular with young women. \u201cIt\u2019s a really difficult age to articulate how you\u2019re feeling,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re all so stressed out. We\u2019re so confused, so lonely. Poetry is an incredible form of solace. If you encounter something in a poem that you feel you\u2019re feeling, it is a freeing, lovely experience.\u201d</p> <p>Cox, 23, leapt into the list of top 10 bestselling poets last year with <em>She Must Be Mad</em>, her debut collection of poems about her journey from girl to woman. Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/oct/04/rupi-kaur-instapoets-the-sun-and-her-flowers\" title=\"\">Rupi Kaur</a>, the 26-year-old Canadian-Punjabi who dominated the bestsellers last year, Cox first began publishing on Instagram. \u201cA lot of the poets who are coming from online platforms are women or people of colour, and I think that has unsettled the very traditional, predominantly white, older male community, who have spent so long feeling that poetry is an incredibly exclusive academic club. Well, it\u2019s not any more. Suddenly, it\u2019s being blown open,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Young women aged 13 to 24 are now the biggest consumers of poetry in the UK in a market that has grown by 48% over the past five years to \u00a312.3m, according to UK book sales monitor Nielsen BookScan. But instead of buying works by the dead white men who have dominated the canon for centuries, young women are using their economic muscle to drive up sales of works by female poets, making poetry more diverse and representative than ever before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cd3d37acec208be7bd4ead7b94b20eff11d3c56b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd3d37acec208be7bd4ead7b94b20eff11d3c56b/1402_0_3212_4016/800.jpg\" alt=\"Rupi Kaur.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupi Kaur.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Aziz</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kaur, for example, made nearly \u00a31m from poetry sales last year. Her themes include menstrual taboos, sexual violence and women\u2019s empowerment. Three other women \u2013 Pam Ayres, Helen Dunmore and Carol Ann Duffy, the UK\u2019s first ever female poet laureate \u2013 all netted sales into six-figures, something almost unheard of five years ago. Contemporary feminist poet Wendy Cope managed to sell almost as many volumes as perennial favourite Sylvia Plath.</p> <p>This rise in the popularity of poetry by women and the increase in the value of the market corresponds with dramatic shifts in the demographics of poetry buyers. Five years ago, Nielsen\u2019s research suggests 27% of poetry buyers were young women and another 27% were middle-aged or elderly men. Today, nearly 40% of poetry buyers are women under 35 while just 18% are men over 34. The proportion of teenage boys and young men in their early 20s who purchase poetry has also increased, from 12% in 2014 to 16% today.</p> <p>The ease with which poetry can be published online, read on mobile phones and shared on social media is one reason why the form <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/21/poetry-sales-soar-as-political-millennials-search-for-clarity\" title=\"\">has become more popular with teenagers and millennials</a>, with young poets attracting millions of followers on Instagram.</p> <p>This is opening up the market to younger and more diverse female voices, says Susannah Herbert, director of the Forward Arts Foundation, which runs the Forward Prizes for poetry and National Poetry Day: \u201cFor young women who don\u2019t necessarily feel they\u2019ve got a massive right to the microphone, poetry offers a space to write and express yourself without crashing into an authority. Then other young women see something of themselves in those poems.</p> <p>\u201cPublishers have noticed there is an appetite for the writing of women and that if they ignore that appetite, they are not going to sell as many books. Young women working in publishing can also see what is popular online and say: this has a market.\u201d</p> <p>Emma Wright, 33, was one of those women. She set up her own poetry publishing house, <a href=\"https://theemmapress.com/\" title=\"\">The Emma Press</a>, at the age of 25 after noticing that all the big publishers and poetry magazines were run by men \u2013 and that certain styles of poetry were not being published. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t because it wasn\u2019t good. It was just not represented. It wasn\u2019t in vogue. But the form, the subject matter and the style really resonated with me. I thought: who are the tastemakers? They did tend to be these older men,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Poetry is far cheaper to edit and print than a novel; on a secondhand Mac, using inexpensive publishing software, Wright\u2019s first poetry pamphlet print run cost her just \u00a31,000. She sells her books direct to readers online as well as in bookshops, and chooses only to publish works which personally interest her: \u201cI\u2019m doing this for a reason and it\u2019s obviously not the money. The payoff is that I publish poetry I want to read. That\u2019s why I started, why I carry on.

But the focus of demonstrators, their ranks swollen by teachers, lawyers and doctors, has switched to Bashir himself. They want him gone.</p> <p>Bashir\u2019s response has been predictably repressive. And the president may succeed in battering his critics into silence, as in the past. But the causes of the unrest cannot be bludgeoned away: a struggling economy, low investment, high unemployment, corruption, bad governance and a potentially disastrous lack of opportunity for new generations of young people.</p> <p>In this respect, Sudan has a lot in common with other Arab countries. Recent weeks have seen protests in Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya and Morocco. Once again, the political temperature is rising. Once again, the failure of governments to meet citizens\u2019 aspirations grows critical. The question now is whether a new age of revolt \u2013 call it Arab spring #2 \u2013 is brewing.</p> <p>Tunisia, home of the first Arab spring, in 2010, is another case in point. It, too, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/26/tunisia-protests-spread-after-journalist-sets-himself-on-fire\" title=\"\">rocked by riots</a> last month. And the unrest was once again triggered by a desperate individual, who self-immolated in protest at low living standards and political stasis. Presidential and parliamentary elections later this year could prove another flashpoint.</p> <p>Talk of democratic renewal in Syria and Yemen is at least premature. Attempts by citizens of these countries to dislodge entrenched regimes led to devastating civil wars. Libya, too, has never regained its balance after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi. In Egypt, the Arab world\u2019s largest country by population, the dictatorship of Hosni Mubarak has been replaced by an even worse one \u2013 that of the general-turned-president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi.</p> <p>Yet despite these tragedies, or perhaps because of them, pressure for change across the Arab world is likely to continue to grow, keeping pace with the growth in populations, inequality and social injustice.

      "bodyText": "Sudan missed out on the Arab spring, but that may be changing. Protests against Omar al-Bashir, the indicted war criminal who has dominated the country for 29 years, are becoming a daily occurrence. Street-level unrest, sparked by rising bread and fuel prices, began last month and spread quickly. But the focus of demonstrators, their ranks swollen by teachers, lawyers and doctors, has switched to Bashir himself. They want him gone. Bashir\u2019s response has been predictably repressive. And the president may succeed in battering his critics into silence, as in the past. But the causes of the unrest cannot be bludgeoned away: a struggling economy, low investment, high unemployment, corruption, bad governance and a potentially disastrous lack of opportunity for new generations of young people. In this respect, Sudan has a lot in common with other Arab countries. Recent weeks have seen protests in Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya and Morocco. Once again, the political temperature is rising. Once again, the failure of governments to meet citizens\u2019 aspirations grows critical. The question now is whether a new age of revolt \u2013 call it Arab spring #2 \u2013 is brewing. Tunisia, home of the first Arab spring, in 2010, is another case in point. It, too, was rocked by riots last month. And the unrest was once again triggered by a desperate individual, who self-immolated in protest at low living standards and political stasis. Presidential and parliamentary elections later this year could prove another flashpoint. Talk of democratic renewal in Syria and Yemen is at least premature. Attempts by citizens of these countries to dislodge entrenched regimes led to devastating civil wars. Libya, too, has never regained its balance after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi. In Egypt, the Arab world\u2019s largest country by population, the dictatorship of Hosni Mubarak has been replaced by an even worse one \u2013 that of the general-turned-president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. Yet despite these tragedies, or perhaps because of them, pressure for change across the Arab world is likely to continue to grow, keeping pace with the growth in populations, inequality and social injustice. Some of this energy will inevitably be misdirected into support for extremist groups that promise radical solutions, such as Islamic State. Some of it will produce increased migration, particularly into southern Europe. But most of the pressure will be directed at governments ill-equipped to respond \u2013 even if they wish to. Last Friday Egypt marked the eighth anniversary of the Tahrir Square revolution that toppled Mubarak. Thanks to Sisi\u2019s shadow, it did so largely in silence. Public spaces are off-limits to protesters. Public media are closely regulated.

If we can make a few quid out of them in the process, all the better.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"224ab367f80be5a4741c78d1802d96bc922e8f3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/224ab367f80be5a4741c78d1802d96bc922e8f3a/0_618_4392_2635/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Coleman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Accrington manager John Coleman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c4c4d93e4b0a585f6e86ed9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-26T12:09:12.781Z\">12.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Frank Lampard speaks:</strong> \u201cIt\u2019s a tough job, a great test for us and it\u2019s the reverse of what we\u2019ve done in the cups so far,\u201d says Derby\u2019s manager, in an interview with BT Sport. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve named a strong team but we go week by week, there\u2019s not so many midweek games this month but we do not have many options across the back, so the team picks itself to a degree.

      "bodyText": "A report on an entertaining game at the Wham Stadium, which hosts Accrington were very unlucky to lose. John Coleman speaks: And to say the Accrington manager is unhappy would be quite an understatement. \u201cI feel physically sick,\u201d he tells BT Sport. \u201cI\u2019m rapidly falling out of love with football. Every week we get stiffed by a refereeing decision. It wasn\u2019t a sending off, it was a fair tackle ... a coming-together. Unfortunately, two weeks running we get an horrific decision. We\u2019re getting this every week and sometimes I feel like packing it in. Good luck to Derby County, but there\u2019s no way their fans will think they deserved to win that game. I hope they go on to win it now, but I can\u2019t see it myself.\u201d Accrington are miffed: In the build-up to the corner that led to Derby\u2019s goal, Janoi donacien was incorrectly penalised for a \u201cfoul\u201d that was actually an excellent tackle. Accrington boss John Coleman raised it with referee John Moss at the time, but I was unsure what his beef was. Frank Lampard speaks: \u201cThe result pleased me the most,\u201d he tells BT Sport. \u201cIt was a tough match and we had to work hard for it. The conditions were difficult and we had to adapt a little bit. Accrington also made things very difficult for us and we\u2019re glad to get the win. It\u2019s nice for all the fans who have travelled to support us. The energy Accrington put into the game made things very hard for us.\u201d Hats off to Accrington: The League One side were a tad unfortunate not to earn at least a draw from this game. They gave as good as they got throughout and rather shot themselves in the foot when Daniel Balaser was sent off with 30 minutes remaining. Two rash, needless challenges earned the midfielder his marching orders, although it could be argued that Accrington\u2019s performance levels didn\u2019t drop in his absence. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! It\u2019s all over and Derby County win by the skin of their teeth. Martyn Waghorn\u2019s scrappy goal in the 78th minute was the difference between the sides, but set up a nail-biting finish. A fine Kelle Roos save from a Billy Kee free-kick at the death ensured Derby got the win after Jayden Bogle had received a straight red for bringing down Paul Smyth when he was clean through on the Derby goal. 90+5 min: Another long free-kick from Accrington, which Derby clear. 90+4 min: Accrington win a free-kick deep inside their own half. Goalkeeper Jonny Maxted takes it too quickly, pumping the ball forward before any of his team-mates have had a chance to get into the Derby box. 90+3 min: Another free-kick for Accrington in a good position. Jozefzoon is booked for refusing to retreat 10 yards. The ball\u2019s touched to Billy Kee, who smashes it into the Derby wall. 90+1 min: Accrington have two men in the Derby wall, who move out of the way as Billy Kee attempts to place the ball into the bottom right-hand corner. An unsighted Kelle Roos gets down to save brilliantly, although Kee could have hit the ball a lot harder. Red card! Jayden Bogle is sent off \u2013 a straight red - for dragging down Paul Smyth after the striker latched on to a long ball down the field and was advancing towards the Derby penalty area. Accrington have a free-kick just on the edge of the penalty area. 89 min: For all their good play, Accrington havenb\u2019t done enough in front of goal this afternoon. They haven\u2019t had a single shot on target yet. 88 min: There\u2019s a break in play as Martyn Waghorn receives treatment for an injury. He walks off the pitch and is replaced by Max Bird. 86 min: Accrington win a free-kick, with Smyth going down under a challenge from Jayden Bogle, just outside the Derby penalty area, in the right-back area of the field. The ball\u2019s chipped into the penalty area, Bogle clears for Derby and they gallop down the pitch on the counter. Through on goal, Mason Bennett shoots and brings a good save out of Jonny Maxted, who stands tall and keeps his team in the game. 84 min: Accrington double-substitution: wing-backs Janoi Donacien and Callum Johnson have both had excellent games, but make way for Scott Brown and Paul Smyth. Smyth makes his Accrington debut, having signed on loan from QPR yesterday. 83 min: Accrington win a corner and the ball\u2019s floated into the Derby penalty area, hanging on the wind. It\u2019s headed clear. 80 min: A kick in the teeth for Accrington, who have done so well this afternoon. Holmes took the corner, playing it to a team-mate stabnding on the right edge of the penalty area, before receiving the return pass and marauding into the penalty area. He took a shot which was blocked by Sean McConville, but the ball broke for Waghorn, who fired home from close range, courtesy of a deflection. Derby take the lead! It\u2019s a scrappy goal from a corner, with Waghorn bundling the ball over the line after excellent work from Duane Holmes. 75 min: Callum Johnson tries to pick out Donacien in the Derby penalty area with a cross from the right, but the ball doesn\u2019t bounce kindly for the wing-back and Derby clear their lines. The Championship side have failed utterly to make their man advantage count in the past 15 minutes. 73 min: Derby corner. Duane Holmes rolls it to Scott Malone on the edge of the area in a move from the training ground, but his shot is blocked. The ball goes out for another corner, from which nothing comes. 71 min: Derby County substitution: Florian Jozefzoon on for Harry Wilson, who\u2019s had a very poor game by his own high standards. The loan signing from Liverpool has been very quiet today. 70 min: Completely unmarked, Billy Kee gets on the end of a cross into the Derby penalty area from the right and sends a good header flashing inches wide of the upright. This is very impressive from Accrington, who have created two decent scoring chances since going a man down. 68 min: On the left flank, Holmes, under the hammer, switches the play from one side of the pitch to the other. His side win a free-kick for a foul on Richard Keogh, the Derby captain who has played every minute of every single match his team has played this season. 66 min: It\u2019s as you were for Accrington, despite them being down to 10 men. They\u2019re still playing with three at the backs and their wing-backs are still getting forward at every opportunity. Their only concession to being a man down seems to be right-winger Sean McConville playing in a more central role. 65 min: Billy Kee gets his first sight of goal and sends a shot fizzing just wide after being teed up just inside the Derby penalty area by Donacien. That was a great chance. 62 min: With a man advantage, Derby set about trying to win this game in the final 30 minutes. They get a two-on-two in the Accrington half, but squander a decent opportunity when Harry Wilson misplaces a pass. Accrington subsequently win a free-kick when Sean McConnville is barged over the sideline by Mason Bennett. Red card! Moments after his near miss, Barlaser is sent off for picking up his second yellow card. He needlessly dived into a challenge on David Nugent and can have no complaints. His first yellow was also for needlessly reckless challenge on Harry Wilson. Accrington are down to 10 men and the camera in the home dressing-room shows Barlaser to be utterly distraught. 56 min: A brilliant block by Fikayo Tomori prevents Daniel Barlaser from opening the scoring for after a neat one-two with McConville in the Derby County penalty area. 54 min: Mason Bennett sends an inviting cross into the Derby County from the left flank. Ben Richards-Everton makes a dog\u2019s dinner of his effort to block and allows the ball to squirm between his legs. Luckily for him, he got enough of a touch on it to steer it out of the reach of the lurking Jayden Bogle at the far post. 53 min: The windy conditions are causing several of the players problems and Accrington keeper Jonny Maxted is the latest to suffer as a clearances is carried out over the sideline. 52 min: Accrington go on the attack, having been under the cosh in the early stages of this second half. Ross Sykes attempts to cross the ball into the Derby County penalty area from a deep position on the right, but overcooks his effort and sends the ball sailing wide. 50 min: Derby County attack down the left flank again and Scott Malone floats in a terrific cross. Martyn Waghorn slides in to try and poke the ball home at the far post, but the ball bounces underneath his outstretched left leg and away to safety. A let-off for Accrington. 48 min: Mason Bennett plays a good ball down the left flank for Duane Holmes to chase. With David Nugent haring into the penalty area screaming for the ball, Holmes sends in a cross. Janoi Donacien is on hand to clear. 47 min: Interviewed on BT Sport as he returned to his dug-out, Accrington manager John Coleman had this to say: \u201c[We need to] just believe in themselves a bit more. There\u2019s nothing in it. We\u2019re pleased with the way we\u2019ve stuck to our game plan, but we\u2019ve got to do more. We\u2019ve got to make their goalkeeper work more.\u201d 46 min: Derby get the second half started and immediately go on the attack. David Nugent drives down the left side and pulls the ball into the penalty area. Mason Bennett tries to steer the ball goalwards, but has to stretch and can\u2019t make clean contact under pressure from a defender. It\u2019s all square at the break at the Wham Stadium, where the deadlock remains unbroken. Both sides have had their chances to score in an entertaining first half, in which Accrington demonstrated they are anything but pushovers. It\u2019s all to play for in the second half, with a place in the fifth round of the FA Cup up for grabs. 44 min: Duane Holmes crosses into the Accrington penalty area after good hold-up play from David Nugent. It\u2019s a decent cross, which Mason Bennett attempts to steer goalwards with an ambitious, acrobatic overhead kick that doesn\u2019t quite work out for him. 43 min: Jayden Bogle and Ross Sykes get a telling-off form Jon Moss for an off-the-ball incident after Bogle had been dispossessed by a good tackle in the Accrington penalty area. Sykes subsequently accused the player of diving, somewhat unfairly in my opinion, prompting a bit of minor handbags. 41 min: Scott Malone plays the ball forward for Derby County, but it\u2019s hacked clear by a defender. Accrington Stanley are more than holding their own in this first half, showing no fear whatsoever. They\u2019re being encouraged to get forward, particularly their two wing-backs, Callum Johnson and Jordan Clark. 38 min: Mason Bennett is immediately penalised for a foul on Ross Sykes, whose heels he clips as the Accrington man chases the ball down the touchline. 37 min: Derby substitution: Mason Mount off with what looks like a hamstring injury, Mason Bennett on. It\u2019s a speedy striker for a midfielder, but a Mason for a Mason. 35 min: For Derby, George Evans tries his luck from distance. He doesn\u2019t get much power on his low, bouncing drive, but there are several bodies between he and Accrington goalkeeper Jonny Maxted, who sees the ball late but saves nevertheless. 35 min: Derby win a corner. Mason Mount, who looks to be struggling with some sort of niggle, sends the ball arrowing into the penalty area. Ross Sykes clears for Accrington. 34 min: Kee is fit to continue and play resumes with a throw-in for Accrington. 31 min: Billy Kee goes down injured under a challenge from Martyn Waghorn while trying to hold the ball up. Accrington\u2019s fans are incensed as Derby\u2019s players refuse to put the ball out of play. Fikayo Tomori eventually does so and Kee gets treatment for an ankle injury. Replays show that Waghorn fouled him, sliding in and catching his ankle. 29 min: Accrington\u2019s Sean McConville attempts to curl a shot into the top right-hand corner from distance, but his effort goes a little too high and a little too wide of the angle of cross-bar and upright. 28 min: Jordan Clark picks out Callum Johnson in acres of space just outside the Derby penalty area, near the right side. The ball bobbles towards the full-back, but he steers his first-time effort wide of the far post. 27 min: George Evans tries to wriggle down the right wing for Derby County, but can find no way past Ben Richards-Everton. 25 min: Jordan Clark advances towards the Derby County penalty area and unleashes a shot. His low drive goes through the legs of Richard Keogh, but is pulled wide of the far upright. 22 min: McConville releases Janoi Donacien down the left touchline, but Martyn Waghorn is back to dispossess the St Lucian, who is on loan from Ipswich Town, of possession. 21 min: An excellent challenge by Accrington central defender Mark Hughes in his own penalty area prevents Duane Holmes from unleashing a shot on goal. 19 min: Derby County win a corner after a good marauding run through the centre by Richard Keogh. The ball\u2019s swung into the mixer and Accrington clear. 18 min: A foul by Martyn Waghorn gives Accringotn a free-kick on the left flank, but Sean McConville\u2019s flat delivery doesn\u2019t trouble Derby\u2019s defence. This has been a decent game so far. Both teams could and should have scored at least once, but Accrington are in the ascendency. 16 min: Barlaser and Clark combine on the edge of the Derby penalty area and Accrington get a cross into the box, aiming for Billy Kee. It\u2019s cleared. 15 min: Sean McConville releases Jordan Clark down the left hand side with a beautiful pass. Play is switched to the right flank, the ball\u2019s crossed into the penalty area and Accrington win another corner. Nothing comes of it. 13 min: Accrington win a corner which is taken short to Barlaser. \u201cGet the ball in the box!\u201d comes a roar from the crowd and Accrington eventually do exactly that. It\u2019s cleared. 10 min: Accrington go close. Sean McConville gets on the end of a wonderful cross-field pass to the corner from Daniel Barlaser and sends a cross fizzing into the penalty area from the right. It\u2019s a great delivery, but Jordan Clark makes a mess of his volley from seven or eight yards out with the goal at his mercy. It\u2019s possible his team-mate Billy Kee got in his way and distracted him, but that was a brilliant chance. 8 min: Mason Mount crosses into the Accrington penalty area, where Martyn Waghorn\u2019s downward header bounces into the arms of Jonny Maxted. Waghorn should have scored, but the pitch seemed to take the venom out of his header. 7 min: Accrington win a free-kick just inside the Derby half, wide on the left. Sean McConville boots the ball long, trying to pick out the imposing Ben Richards-Everton. He heads goalwards, but his effort is saved easily. 4 min: Derby attack down the left flank again after Dutch goalkeeper Kelle Roos plays the ball out from the back. Harry Wilson wins a throw-in, but Accrington full-back Callum Johnson hoofs the ball clear. 3 min: Accrington midfielder Daniel Barlaser gets booked for a late lunge on Harry Wilson. 2 min: Accrington goalkeeper Jonny Maxted gets an early touch, placing the ball for a goal-kick and booting it long over the halfway line. 2 min: Derby County work the ball down the left and Mason Mount sends a cross in from the left. It\u2019s headed clear. 1 min: the home side get the ball rolling on what looks a sunny but crisp and fresh afternoon in Accrington. Accrington wear all reed, while Derby County are in all white kit. The pitch looks a bit threadbare and is quite muddy in spots. Not long now: There\u2019s nothing so glamorous as a tunnel at the Wham Stadium, so the teams congregate outside the poky dressing-rooms and amble out on to the pitch ledf by referee Jon Moss. Kick-off is just a minute or two away. It\u2019s a sell-out: The \u201cHouse Full\u201d signs are up outside Wham Stadium, where all 5,400 tickets have been sold for today\u2019s game. Derby have taken 2,600 supporters, which should make for a terrific atmosphere. John Coleman speaks: Speaking to BT Sport, Accrington\u2019s manager, who masterminded his team\u2019s ascent from the seventh to the third tier of English football, sounds very bullish about his team\u2019s chances. \u201cI find it funny, to be honest,\u201d he says, when asked about people considering this match a bye for Derby. \u201cA lot of teams have come to this ground expecting a bye and they\u2019ve gone home with their tails between their legs.\u201d Asked about the ethos of the club and its players, he has this to say. \u201cPlayers have to buy into the team spirit. I want my players to make loads of money, but they\u2019re not going to do with that us. What we can do, however, is give them a platform from which to showcase their talent and work ethic and hopefully we\u2019ll get two or three years out of them before they move elsewhere. If we can make a few quid out of them in the process, all the better.\u201d Frank Lampard speaks: \u201cIt\u2019s a tough job, a great test for us and it\u2019s the reverse of what we\u2019ve done in the cups so far,\u201d says Derby\u2019s manager, in an interview with BT Sport. \u201cI\u2019ve named a strong team but we go week by week, there\u2019s not so many midweek games this month but we do not have many options across the back, so the team picks itself to a degree. I\u2019ve put a couple of young lads in there and they\u2019re ready to give it a go.\u201d Accrington Stanley: Maxted, Johnson, Hughes, Donacien, Richards-Everton, Clark, McConville, Sykes, Conneely, Barlaser, Kee. Subs: Brown, Zanzala, Rodgers, Mangan, Mingoia, Evtimov, Smyth. Derby: Roos, Bogle, Keogh, Tomori, Malone, Harry Wilson, Evans, Mount, Waghorn, Nugent, Holmes. Subs: Jozefzoon, Bennett, Mitchell, MacDonald, Bird, Huddlestone, Mitchell-Lawson. Referee: Jon Moss (W Yorkshire) Early team news Accrington are without midfielder Sam Finley, who has been given a five-game ban for violent after appearing to stamp on Charlton\u2019s Lyle Taylor last weekend. Goalkeeper Jonny Maxted is available after having his red card for an incident in the same game overturned. For Derby, Tom Lawrence, Scott Carson and Andre Wisdom are all out injured, while Ashley Cole is unlikely to be fit enough to play despite signing for the Rams earlier this week. Accrington and Derby County meet for the very first time in a competitive football match, with a place in the fifth round of the FA Cup up for grabs. League One side Accrington have already beaten Championship opposition, having beaten Ipswich in the third round, while Derby County also punched above their weight. Frank Lampard\u2019s side went through on penalties after a third round replay against Southampton. Accrington\u2019s 5,400-capacity Wham Stadium is the venue for this afternoon\u2019s encounter and kick-off is at 12.30pm (GMT). Stay tuned for team news and build-up.",

Backed by a band, guest vocalists and MCs \u2013 Kevin Mark Trail, from the <em>Original Pirate Material</em> era, and Swindon MC Grim Sickers among them \u2013 he climbs up on a monitor and clasps the sweaty fingers of the front row. In his funny, highly Skinneresque 2013 short film, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht5UQhG4zzM\" title=\"\">Spoiler Alert</a></em>, he plays an anxious type so paranoid about dying he avoids stepping on cracks and builds a death-predicting computer.

He treats the gig as an opportunity repeatedly to plug the after-party, where he will be DJing.</p> <p>With what could be a surfeit of candour, Skinner has described DJing as more creative than playing his own songs, because, to paraphrase, of the \u201cstress\u201d and \u201ccreativity\u201d of not knowing what he\u2019ll be doing in three minutes\u2019 time.</p> <p>Will the Darker the Shadow, the Brighter the Light finally give Skinner the mature second act his talent deserves? It\u2019s hard to say: Plan B, to name another cinematically inclined vintage MC, made the transition to film, but without the validation of a huge box office. His return to music last year failed to recapture the mass appeal he had around the time of 2010\u2019s <em>The Defamation of Strickland Banks</em>.</p> <p>One thing is certain: however much the fans desire it, doing tour after tour risks defining the Streets as a nostalgia act with a little new-project window dressing to move the narrative along. It\u2019s a familiar pattern for old bands eking out second lives. Has it come to this?</p>",

An inveterate plot machine, he even needs to give his gigs a narrative. \u201cYou, I need to persuade you,\u201d he repeatedly points to some girl down the front. \u201cAre you on Instagram Live?\u201d he demands again and again of the myriad fans filming on cameraphones. He treats the gig as an opportunity repeatedly to plug the after-party, where he will be DJing. With what could be a surfeit of candour, Skinner has described DJing as more creative than playing his own songs, because, to paraphrase, of the \u201cstress\u201d and \u201ccreativity\u201d of not knowing what he\u2019ll be doing in three minutes\u2019 time. Will the Darker the Shadow, the Brighter the Light finally give Skinner the mature second act his talent deserves? It\u2019s hard to say: Plan B, to name another cinematically inclined vintage MC, made the transition to film, but without the validation of a huge box office. His return to music last year failed to recapture the mass appeal he had around the time of 2010\u2019s The Defamation of Strickland Banks. One thing is certain: however much the fans desire it, doing tour after tour risks defining the Streets as a nostalgia act with a little new-project window dressing to move the narrative along. It\u2019s a familiar pattern for old bands eking out second lives. Has it come to this?",

I first started taking notes on it eight years ago. There had been a lot of books about decisions, but they were almost all focused on short-term instinctive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/06/scienceandnature.society\" title=\"\"><em>Blink</em></a>-like decisions. I love those books but it did seem odd that I\u2019d spent so much time looking at short-term decisions when the decisions that really end up shaping your life require deliberation and foresight and all of these properties that I felt were being unappreciated. Then I stumbled across Darwin\u2019s notebooks in which he has this two-page pros and cons list, trying to decide whether to get married.</p> <p>It\u2019s the same technique most people learn to this day, which meant that on some level the science of decision-making has been stagnant for 170 years. At the same time, I became obsessed with moving from New York to California. Those two things together made me think that it would be interesting to write about complex decisions and how we make them.</p> <p><strong>Are the decisions that matter </strong><strong>most personal or global</strong><strong>? </strong><strong>Is there a difference in approach between the</strong><strong>m?</strong><br>There are enough similarities between the techniques or mindset we need for making personal and global decisions that it is useful to examine both in the same book. But personal decisions \u2013 whether you should get married, for example \u2013 are made from a position of ignorance; on some level it\u2019s unknowable. This book is not about how to be 100% right with your decisions \u2013 it\u2019s just that you will get better outcomes if you take time to go through the process that I talk about.</p> <p><strong>As there is no control group for this alternative \u201cus\u201d, how can we know that deliberation will produce better results?</strong><br>There are a couple of different ways to answer that question. The first is we do have some science looking at real-world decisions \u2013 for instance, there\u2019s interesting research involving mock juries. You can see how people deliberated and whether they made the correct assessment.</p> <p>But I also think there\u2019s this really important process of storytelling, which is a kind of simulation, that\u2019s part of those more personal decisions. That\u2019s why a lot of this book is about reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/10/100-best-novels-middlemarch-george-eliot\" title=\"\"><em>Middlemarch.</em></a> Experiencing these simulated lives is practice for our own. It trains us to be better at making decisions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Diverse groups tend to make more nuanced and original decisions than homogeneous ones do</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>I\u2019m not sure </strong><strong>people read novels in that way or, indeed, lead their emotional lives in sober deliberation\u2026</strong><br>Well, the other side of simulation, which is really interesting, is the mental simulations we do imagining future outcomes. There\u2019s an incredible set of brain studies from the 1990s and early 2000s, in the early days of fMRIs and Pet scans, looking at what parts of the brain lit up when people did specific tasks, such as multiplication or remembering faces. To have a control group, they also asked people to think about nothing. They discovered that when people were trying to think of nothing, certain regions of their brains were still active.

      "bodyText": "Steven Johnson is a popular science author of 11 books, including the bestseller Everything Bad Is Good for You. Now 50, he divides his time between California and New York, the decision of where to live being at the heart of his latest book, Farsighted: How We Make the Decisions That Matter the Most. It focuses on long-term and complex decision-making \u2013 both political and personal. What made you decide to write about decision-making? It had the longest incubation period of any of my books, which is maybe appropriate for a book that\u2019s about long-term decision making. I first started taking notes on it eight years ago. There had been a lot of books about decisions, but they were almost all focused on short-term instinctive Blink-like decisions. I love those books but it did seem odd that I\u2019d spent so much time looking at short-term decisions when the decisions that really end up shaping your life require deliberation and foresight and all of these properties that I felt were being unappreciated. Then I stumbled across Darwin\u2019s notebooks in which he has this two-page pros and cons list, trying to decide whether to get married. It\u2019s the same technique most people learn to this day, which meant that on some level the science of decision-making has been stagnant for 170 years. At the same time, I became obsessed with moving from New York to California. Those two things together made me think that it would be interesting to write about complex decisions and how we make them. Are the decisions that matter most personal or global? Is there a difference in approach between them? There are enough similarities between the techniques or mindset we need for making personal and global decisions that it is useful to examine both in the same book. But personal decisions \u2013 whether you should get married, for example \u2013 are made from a position of ignorance; on some level it\u2019s unknowable. This book is not about how to be 100% right with your decisions \u2013 it\u2019s just that you will get better outcomes if you take time to go through the process that I talk about. As there is no control group for this alternative \u201cus\u201d, how can we know that deliberation will produce better results? There are a couple of different ways to answer that question. The first is we do have some science looking at real-world decisions \u2013 for instance, there\u2019s interesting research involving mock juries. You can see how people deliberated and whether they made the correct assessment. But I also think there\u2019s this really important process of storytelling, which is a kind of simulation, that\u2019s part of those more personal decisions. That\u2019s why a lot of this book is about reading Middlemarch. Experiencing these simulated lives is practice for our own. It trains us to be better at making decisions. I\u2019m not sure people read novels in that way or, indeed, lead their emotional lives in sober deliberation\u2026 Well, the other side of simulation, which is really interesting, is the mental simulations we do imagining future outcomes. There\u2019s an incredible set of brain studies from the 1990s and early 2000s, in the early days of fMRIs and Pet scans, looking at what parts of the brain lit up when people did specific tasks, such as multiplication or remembering faces. To have a control group, they also asked people to think about nothing. They discovered that when people were trying to think of nothing, certain regions of their brains were still active. This became known as the \u201cdefault network\u201d, which is what lights up when people are daydreaming basically, mind-wandering. What people are doing then is spending a huge amount of time running simulations of future events based on the recent past. What will happen next week if I go in and ask for that raise? I wonder if I should break up with that person \u2013 how would I feel? It uses up a huge amount of energy, literal energy in the brain, to do it. Some people now think that the ability to imagine alternative futures is one of our signature traits as a species. It\u2019s like the brain\u2019s internal version of reading novels. You also look at what we can learn about long-term decision-making from the killing of Osama bin Laden. First, it\u2019s a good reminder of what a structured decision process looks like in a functional administration. I think that we tend to celebrate the results of good decisions, but not the decision process itself, which is the thing we can actually learn from. They consciously divided the process into \u201cdivergent\u201d and \u201cconvergent\u201d stages \u2013 the divergent stage is brainstorming. Then they challenged their assumptions, to test for confirmation bias and overconfidence. They did a premortem \u2013 where you imagine all the reasons why, in the future, the decision turns out to have been a terrible mistake. So with Bin Laden, once they decided that they were going to do a helicopter raid through Pakistani airspace without telling the Pakistani government, they anticipated that they might block US supply routes to Afghanistan. Six weeks before the raid, the US opened up a different supply route. That\u2019s the kind of thing we should be celebrating. We should be looking for leaders who are capable of thinking this way. You emphasise the importance of diversity in decision-making. What\u2019s its significance? We celebrate diversity in terms of social tolerance, equality of opportunity, or the idea that groups are now represented in a way that they weren\u2019t before \u2013 but there\u2019s another part we should remember, which is that a more diverse Congress will make better decisions.

So, it\u2019s not just that we want more women in Congress, it\u2019s also that we want them there because the group will be collectively smarter.

Bonnard met her in Paris in 1893, when both were in their 20s. Small, cat-like in her movements and pronounced self-containment, Marthe lived with him for more than 50 years. Bonnard would ask her to walk about for preliminary drawings, and there is some sense of recollected motion in the standing nudes where he suddenly seems to come across her in front of the mirror, with a towel, or before a window that edges her body with something more like opaque liquid than sunshine.

Her presence is there, you feel, even when her figure is not. There were other lovers, particularly when Bonnard was in his late 40s and fell in love with a young model; she killed herself when he later changed his mind and returned to Marthe. Bonnard is said to have painted darker night scenes around this time, but the crisis is nowhere visible at Tate Modern; and despite the curators\u2019 inclusion of two hopeless battle landscapes, neither is there any sense of the horrors of war.</p> <p>What were the couple to each other? That is one of the abiding enigmas of his art, and this show. The same woman keeps appearing, her face averted, in and out of the bath, on the margins, repeatedly from behind. Her legs rise vertically up the canvas, lying in the tub; her head bends low over some unseen work. Her body is boneless, tubular, like that of a cloth mannequin. She never changes; she never ages. It is as if she never speaks. Bonnard\u2019s friends described her as practically silent.</p> <p>And there he is again, and again, watching her across the dinner table, looking up at her as she stands pinning her hair, or down at her in the pale tomb of the bath. Marthe spent hours there every day, trying to stave off some physical or psychological complaint that has never quite been established. Perhaps Bonnard turned to the venerable theme of bathers because of it; perhaps they were both equally immersed, as it were, in the concatenation of light on water, ceramic tiles and glass panes, by the mingling of ripples, colours and refractions. In at least one work, painted two years before her death in 1940, Marthe is so deeply absorbed within the silver-blue scene that her body scarcely registers at all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6e9237c4da249c47bd50f54d2991db62cf74367\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6e9237c4da249c47bd50f54d2991db62cf74367/0_0_3421_5068/675.jpg\" alt=\"In the Bathroom, c1940.\" width=\"675\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the Bathroom, c1940.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Private Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bonnard said he wanted his art to convey the experience of someone just entering a room, trying to take in the full optical plenitude. Perhaps it is true that our eyes sometimes overlook the presence of others in the first second or two, but Marthe\u2019s fugitive person (or is it personality?) \u2013 sometimes just an ankle, an arm, or a sliver of profile \u2013 is something quite else. She is contained within a scene like the water inside the bath, the fruit within the peel, the room inside the house: each phenomenon simply there and coexistent with the others. Bonnard paints a continuum.</p> <p>Flowers float free of the wallpaper to become entwined with vases, drapes, the very atmosphere of a room. Light drifts, people are withdrawn, patches of colour melt like snow. Some of Bonnard\u2019s paintings defy legibility altogether, at first. What would we do without all those marked verticals \u2013 the edges of doors, windows, wardrobes, screens \u2013 that seem to structure the image; except that they too may prove confusing. It is sometimes said that these uprights refer to the business of painting on rectilinear 2D canvases; but my sense is that he is never so programmatic. The pleasure of looking at a great Bonnard has at least something to do with the struggle of its making, of trying to get the impression of a room (or even just the memory of that impression) into the picture whole.</p> <p>Bonnard was prolific \u2013 and uneven. Too many mediocrities are jumbled among the masterpieces at Tate Modern. It would have been a revelation to see the bath scenes grouped, instead of scattered; to see the self-portraits isolated from the flaccid landscapes around them. Bonnard can be twee \u2013 pop-up cats \u2013 and it seems only honest to concede that Marthe sometimes looks like a doll. What he felt about their marriage \u2013 shared happiness, mutual bondage \u2013 is not vouchsafed, except in the way that he paints; and possibly in Bonnard\u2019s self-portraits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e91767d8f9e413b6228c9a8c42e16bd04ed2a4cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e91767d8f9e413b6228c9a8c42e16bd04ed2a4cc/0_0_5176_4482/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Self-portrait, c1938: \u2018a ghost in glasses\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"866\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Self-portrait, c1938: \u2018a ghost in glasses\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Private collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These paintings breach the supposed serenity of his art. The artist appears lonely, trapped in the mirror \u2013 blood-red and raw as if flayed, or raising puny fists as if to fight his poor self. There are the fascinating bathroom tiles, and a shelf of gleaming objects to praise. But behind them, he is a ghost in glasses, or a Noh tragedian with black eyes in a grief-stricken mask. In the most devastating of all the late self-portraits, Bonnard has become a pale, bald spaceman of indeterminate age \u2013 baffling in his own eyes, a stranger even to himself.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/cc-land-exhibition-pierre-bonnard-colour-memory\" title=\"\">Pierre Bonnard: The Colour of Memory</a> is at Tate Modern, London, until 6 May</p>",

The same woman keeps appearing, her face averted, in and out of the bath, on the margins, repeatedly from behind. Her legs rise vertically up the canvas, lying in the tub; her head bends low over some unseen work. Her body is boneless, tubular, like that of a cloth mannequin. She never changes; she never ages. It is as if she never speaks. Bonnard\u2019s friends described her as practically silent. And there he is again, and again, watching her across the dinner table, looking up at her as she stands pinning her hair, or down at her in the pale tomb of the bath. Marthe spent hours there every day, trying to stave off some physical or psychological complaint that has never quite been established. Perhaps Bonnard turned to the venerable theme of bathers because of it; perhaps they were both equally immersed, as it were, in the concatenation of light on water, ceramic tiles and glass panes, by the mingling of ripples, colours and refractions. In at least one work, painted two years before her death in 1940, Marthe is so deeply absorbed within the silver-blue scene that her body scarcely registers at all. Bonnard said he wanted his art to convey the experience of someone just entering a room, trying to take in the full optical plenitude. Perhaps it is true that our eyes sometimes overlook the presence of others in the first second or two, but Marthe\u2019s fugitive person (or is it personality?) \u2013 sometimes just an ankle, an arm, or a sliver of profile \u2013 is something quite else. She is contained within a scene like the water inside the bath, the fruit within the peel, the room inside the house: each phenomenon simply there and coexistent with the others. Bonnard paints a continuum. Flowers float free of the wallpaper to become entwined with vases, drapes, the very atmosphere of a room. Light drifts, people are withdrawn, patches of colour melt like snow. Some of Bonnard\u2019s paintings defy legibility altogether, at first. What would we do without all those marked verticals \u2013 the edges of doors, windows, wardrobes, screens \u2013 that seem to structure the image; except that they too may prove confusing. It is sometimes said that these uprights refer to the business of painting on rectilinear 2D canvases; but my sense is that he is never so programmatic. The pleasure of looking at a great Bonnard has at least something to do with the struggle of its making, of trying to get the impression of a room (or even just the memory of that impression) into the picture whole. Bonnard was prolific \u2013 and uneven. Too many mediocrities are jumbled among the masterpieces at Tate Modern. It would have been a revelation to see the bath scenes grouped, instead of scattered; to see the self-portraits isolated from the flaccid landscapes around them. Bonnard can be twee \u2013 pop-up cats \u2013 and it seems only honest to concede that Marthe sometimes looks like a doll. What he felt about their marriage \u2013 shared happiness, mutual bondage \u2013 is not vouchsafed, except in the way that he paints; and possibly in Bonnard\u2019s self-portraits. These paintings breach the supposed serenity of his art. The artist appears lonely, trapped in the mirror \u2013 blood-red and raw as if flayed, or raising puny fists as if to fight his poor self. There are the fascinating bathroom tiles, and a shelf of gleaming objects to praise. But behind them, he is a ghost in glasses, or a Noh tragedian with black eyes in a grief-stricken mask. In the most devastating of all the late self-portraits, Bonnard has become a pale, bald spaceman of indeterminate age \u2013 baffling in his own eyes, a stranger even to himself. \u2022 Pierre Bonnard: The Colour of Memory is at Tate Modern, London, until 6 May",

Like many small towns in southern Italy, it has been gradually abandoned by citizens seeking work elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cThe decline began with the industrialisation of the agricultural sector, when machines replaced human labour and forced many peasants to abandon the fields,\u201d says Lo Vecchio, who used to work as a French language teacher. \u201cThen, if that weren\u2019t enough, the earthquake struck and even more families began abandoning their homes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb81172159e9e8db950f9c3959cf2c4e098335ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb81172159e9e8db950f9c3959cf2c4e098335ca/0_570_6873_4123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Franco Lo Vecchio in his house in Sambuca\u2019s Saraceno quarter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Franco Lo Vecchio in his house in Sambuca\u2019s Saraceno quarter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In January 1968 the earth shook in the Belice valley, in south-west Sicily.

Four towns were razed entirely and others, like Sambuca, suffered terrible damage. The town\u2019s main church, the Chiesa Madre, built around 1420 on part of the ancient Arab castle of Zabut in the oldest part of town, was so badly damaged it had to close.</p> <p>The story of the Lo Vecchio family reflects the history of Sambuca and the emigratory trend that threatens its survival. In 1955, Franco\u2019s grandfather left for the US in search of work. In 1957, his father moved to Venezuela. In 1963, Franco himself left for northern Italy, and his daughter has now settled in Australia. Franco returned to Sambuca three years ago. \u201cI was struck by the deserted roads and by the silence where once the voices of thousands of people echoed in the squares,\u201d he says. \u201cSambuca, my Sambuca, now seemed a cemetery for the living dead.\u201d</p> <p>In an attempt to resuscitate the town, the mayor, Leo Ciaccio, and his deputy, Cacioppo, have adopted a strategy that has become fashionable in the south: sell, or practically give away, abandoned homes to anyone who wants to move in. Other towns have attempted the same thing, including Gangi in northern Sicily, Salemi in the west near Marsala, and Ollolai in Sardinia. The symbolic price of a home: a euro.

And yet the phones keep ringing, hour after hour. \u201cThey\u2019re calling from Sydney, London, New York,\u201d says the exhausted deputy mayor, Giuseppe Cacioppo. A week after the town announced it was putting up abandoned homes for sale at a euro each, he has fielded requests for information from all over the globe. By Wednesday last week the council had received more than 300 calls and 94,000 emails. Many prospective buyers, not wanting to miss out, grabbed the first available flight to Palermo. Sambuca sits inside a nature reserve, surrounded by woods and mountains, about an hour\u2019s drive from the Sicilian capital. In the town hall\u2019s minuscule waiting room there are not enough seats for the dozens of visitors who have come from as far away as Panama, London, Boston and Dubai to get their hands on one of these famed homes for the cost of an espresso. They\u2019re waiting anxiously for Cacioppo to take them on a guided tour of the ruins that are up for sale. It is quite a sight for 63-year-old Franco Lo Vecchio. Curious to see what the chatter is all about, he has rushed out of his house in the nearby Saraceno quarter in his slippers.

      "body": "<p>Talking as part of a panel last weekend, the leader of the Women\u2019s Equality party, Sophie Walker, looked out at the audience with growing unease. \u201cThere was a huge amount of energy in the hall, which was made up of women wanting to learn how to be activists,\u201d says Walker. \u201cBut there was also an air of them bracing themselves to do something quite unpleasant.\u201d</p> <p>They were all aware that stepping into politics was like walking naked into a blizzard. The thought occurred to her, not for the first time, that the current templates for politics and activism were \u201cnot sustainable\u201d. This, in part, is what spurred Walker on to rethink the idea of leadership. \u201cAnd frankly, I think everybody in any position of leadership in politics in Britain should be doing the same.\u201d</p> <p>Last week Walker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/22/womens-equality-party-leader-sophie-walker-steps-down\" title=\"\">resigned as WEP leader</a>, but in her first interview since that announcement, it transpires that it\u2019s not quite as simple as all that.</p> <p>Catherine Mayer and Sandi Toksvig founded the party shortly before the May 2015 general election, with Toksvig explaining: \u201cI have made jokes over and over again about politics. This election, I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d</p> <p>About 1,300 people joined on the first day, including Walker. She was 44, a Reuters journalist with no political experience except campaigning for support for her autistic daughter. \u201cOther parties didn\u2019t see me even at my most desperate and loudest. I was talking as a woman, part of an army of unseen women stepping in when the state had failed us, asking, \u2018Where are you?\u2019 The answer was always, \u2018Well, if you vote for us at election time, we\u2019ll put a bit more money into childcare.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Fuck this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Quickly elected leader of the party, she oversaw the promotion of a manifesto with six core objectives: equal representation in politics and business; equal representation in education; equal pay; equal treatment of women in the media; equal parenting rights; and an end to violence against women. Then she, Mayer and Toksvig urged other parties to steal it.</p> <p>In 2016, Walker stood for London mayor, winning one in 20 votes. \u201cWe were brought on as a surprise candidate at the hustings, and when I walked on stage I saw the candidates go, \u2018Oh shit, now we have to talk about women,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how it works. Just being on that stage made such a difference. Whenever we run a candidate, all the other parties put up women, so we\u2019re doing wonders for female representation just by being there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95e75dd7be59bce9b22e88d54c555a1cba2041c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95e75dd7be59bce9b22e88d54c555a1cba2041c5/294_167_2717_1631/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Walker (centre) in 2015 with WEP founders Sandi Toksvig (left) and Catherine Mayer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Walker (centre) in 2015 with WEP founders Sandi Toksvig (left) and Catherine Mayer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2017, Walker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/23/sophie-walker-shipley-election-2017-yorkshire-tory-philip-davies\" title=\"\">stood </a>in the West Yorkshire seat of Shipley, against Conservative MP Philip Davies, who had repeatedly opposed measures tackling domestic and sexual violence, and had, she said at the time, \u201ca track record of misogyny\u201d. The Green party stood aside, endorsing Walker. Despite failing to oust him, she had no regrets, because WEP had brought attention to his \u201cregressive politics\u201d.</p> <p>WEP\u2019s 2017 party manifesto included a fully-costed plan for universal childcare that would pay for itself within five years, leading (Walker claims) other parties to \u201cup their game\u201d around care, if not yet quite shifting their attitudes.</p> <p>\u201cWe achieved what we did because we had no idea what we were doing \u2013 it\u2019s always been like changing the wheels on a moving car,\u201d Walker says. \u201cAnd it was always really cheering to work with women in parliament like Caroline Lucas, Jo Swinson, Anne Jenkin, Nicky Morgan, people who understand why our party has come to exist.\u201d Still<em> our</em> party? \u201cOh yes.\u201d</p> <p>At home in London, having announced her resignation on Twitter two days earlier, Walker, elegant in leg warmers, pours tea from a pot. She has been waking at 4am to scribble notes on what comes next; she\u2019s been fielding interview requests from journalists asking, \u201cHow does it feel to be a burned-out disappointed woman in politics?\u201d She laughs, darkly. The doorbell rings, a delivery \u2013 a friend has sent her a gift, the biography of Muhammad Ali. There\u2019s no note \u2013 the implication is clear. In her soft Scottish accent she recalls the battles she\u2019s fought during her leadership to debate (and here she performs camp air quotes) \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d: before she can discuss a problem, she must first prove it exists.</p> <p>\u201cWhether equal pay, violence against women, sexual harassment \u2026 I\u2019ve had to grit my teeth through tedious talk shows where they ask, \u2018But isn\u2019t it just flirting?\u2019 It\u2019s relentless. It happened on the <em>Today</em> programme at the height of #MeToo, where I had to debate whether some women \u2026 like it! There have been many points where I\u2019ve had to lock myself in the ladies afterwards and scream. Except then \u2026,\u201d she smiles, suddenly emotional, \u201cThen you come out to a huge wave of women saying thank you.\u201d</p> <p>But this is simply an example of something she\u2019s been struggling with for some time. \u201cA measure of my ability to be a good leader is the number of people that want my job, but women would often say, \u2018I think what you\u2019re doing is great, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019d do that.\u2019 And that, as well as the car crash of Brexit, is what\u2019s led me to think about different models.</p> <p>\u201cBrexit is the ultimate demonstration of how broken our democracy is and how utterly incapable our institutions are of mending it.

      "bodyText": "Talking as part of a panel last weekend, the leader of the Women\u2019s Equality party, Sophie Walker, looked out at the audience with growing unease. \u201cThere was a huge amount of energy in the hall, which was made up of women wanting to learn how to be activists,\u201d says Walker. \u201cBut there was also an air of them bracing themselves to do something quite unpleasant.\u201d They were all aware that stepping into politics was like walking naked into a blizzard. The thought occurred to her, not for the first time, that the current templates for politics and activism were \u201cnot sustainable\u201d. This, in part, is what spurred Walker on to rethink the idea of leadership. \u201cAnd frankly, I think everybody in any position of leadership in politics in Britain should be doing the same.\u201d Last week Walker resigned as WEP leader, but in her first interview since that announcement, it transpires that it\u2019s not quite as simple as all that. Catherine Mayer and Sandi Toksvig founded the party shortly before the May 2015 general election, with Toksvig explaining: \u201cI have made jokes over and over again about politics. This election, I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d About 1,300 people joined on the first day, including Walker. She was 44, a Reuters journalist with no political experience except campaigning for support for her autistic daughter. \u201cOther parties didn\u2019t see me even at my most desperate and loudest. I was talking as a woman, part of an army of unseen women stepping in when the state had failed us, asking, \u2018Where are you?\u2019 The answer was always, \u2018Well, if you vote for us at election time, we\u2019ll put a bit more money into childcare.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Fuck this.\u2019\u201d Quickly elected leader of the party, she oversaw the promotion of a manifesto with six core objectives: equal representation in politics and business; equal representation in education; equal pay; equal treatment of women in the media; equal parenting rights; and an end to violence against women. Then she, Mayer and Toksvig urged other parties to steal it. In 2016, Walker stood for London mayor, winning one in 20 votes. \u201cWe were brought on as a surprise candidate at the hustings, and when I walked on stage I saw the candidates go, \u2018Oh shit, now we have to talk about women,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how it works. Just being on that stage made such a difference. Whenever we run a candidate, all the other parties put up women, so we\u2019re doing wonders for female representation just by being there.\u201d In 2017, Walker stood in the West Yorkshire seat of Shipley, against Conservative MP Philip Davies, who had repeatedly opposed measures tackling domestic and sexual violence, and had, she said at the time, \u201ca track record of misogyny\u201d. The Green party stood aside, endorsing Walker. Despite failing to oust him, she had no regrets, because WEP had brought attention to his \u201cregressive politics\u201d. WEP\u2019s 2017 party manifesto included a fully-costed plan for universal childcare that would pay for itself within five years, leading (Walker claims) other parties to \u201cup their game\u201d around care, if not yet quite shifting their attitudes. \u201cWe achieved what we did because we had no idea what we were doing \u2013 it\u2019s always been like changing the wheels on a moving car,\u201d Walker says. \u201cAnd it was always really cheering to work with women in parliament like Caroline Lucas, Jo Swinson, Anne Jenkin, Nicky Morgan, people who understand why our party has come to exist.\u201d Still our party? \u201cOh yes.\u201d At home in London, having announced her resignation on Twitter two days earlier, Walker, elegant in leg warmers, pours tea from a pot. She has been waking at 4am to scribble notes on what comes next; she\u2019s been fielding interview requests from journalists asking, \u201cHow does it feel to be a burned-out disappointed woman in politics?\u201d She laughs, darkly. The doorbell rings, a delivery \u2013 a friend has sent her a gift, the biography of Muhammad Ali. There\u2019s no note \u2013 the implication is clear. In her soft Scottish accent she recalls the battles she\u2019s fought during her leadership to debate (and here she performs camp air quotes) \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d: before she can discuss a problem, she must first prove it exists. \u201cWhether equal pay, violence against women, sexual harassment \u2026 I\u2019ve had to grit my teeth through tedious talk shows where they ask, \u2018But isn\u2019t it just flirting?\u2019 It\u2019s relentless. It happened on the Today programme at the height of #MeToo, where I had to debate whether some women \u2026 like it! There have been many points where I\u2019ve had to lock myself in the ladies afterwards and scream. Except then \u2026,\u201d she smiles, suddenly emotional, \u201cThen you come out to a huge wave of women saying thank you.\u201d But this is simply an example of something she\u2019s been struggling with for some time. \u201cA measure of my ability to be a good leader is the number of people that want my job, but women would often say, \u2018I think what you\u2019re doing is great, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019d do that.\u2019 And that, as well as the car crash of Brexit, is what\u2019s led me to think about different models. \u201cBrexit is the ultimate demonstration of how broken our democracy is and how utterly incapable our institutions are of mending it. The reason it\u2019s impossible to deliver is because it\u2019s about feelings and representation and a loss of dignity, and you\u2019re not going to answer that with an endless argument about the Norway model.\u201d You can\u2019t have one person going into battle, she explains, trying to represent the thoughts of thousands, especially as the ground is moving beneath them. \u201cPlease don\u2019t think I\u2019m comparing myself to Michelle Obama,\u201d she says. \u201cChrist no. But it\u2019s like she said: people want a saviour, a guru, and that doesn\u2019t work because we don\u2019t need one man, we need a movement.\u201d Which is why she\u2019s considering collective leadership models, and why she\u2019s making space for women of different backgrounds to come forward. \u201cWhile I completely understood the #AskHerToStand campaign, I also felt very frustrated, because unless that comes with serious support it\u2019s basically Lean In for politics. And that sets women up to fail. \u201cWEP is the only party that offers the level of support that we do, and despite the restrictions of electoral rules that say you\u2019re not allowed quotas of BME candidates, we always make sure we work creatively to effectively make it happen.\u201d They already offer childcare support to candidates, but \u201cI\u2019d like us to be thinking about how we build more structured support around these women too, with mentoring and mental health support.\u201d The latter is, perhaps, one of the requirements for people entering politics today. \u201cOur current templates are not sustainable.

You\u2019re never allowed to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019, which means you either get easy answers or evasion. That was one of the shocks, coming into politics. Finding myself in an interview where they\u2019re just waiting for me to fall into a hole. \u201cSuspicion on both sides just isn\u2019t conducive to creativity.

The emergence of the \u2018strong man\u2019\u2026\u201d On her fingers she counts off Trump, Bolsonaro, Orb\u00e1n. \u201cAnd in Britain too, with the Brexit men saying they\u2019re \u2018telling it straight\u2019. It\u2019s fossilising, it\u2019s becoming shoutier and shoutier.\u201d She is sitting forward, her voice brittle. \u201cWe have huge problems with globalisation but also huge problems in that massive swaths of people have never been seen or heard.

      "bodyText": "Ireland has dismissed the suggestion that the best solution to the Brexit impasse might be for the country to quit the EU and join the UK. Questioned about the possibility by the BBC Today presenter John Humphrys, Ireland\u2019s Europe minister, Helen McEntee, said it was not contemplating quitting the EU, that polls showed 92% of the population wanted to remain in the bloc, and \u201cIrexit\u201d was not plausible. She told the Radio 4 programme on Saturday that, in the event of no deal, Ireland was \u201cnot planning for the reintroduction of a border\u201d, and urged the UK to honour its commitment to ensure the border remained invisible, as it had since the Good Friday peace deal was signed nearly 21 years ago. Humphrys said: \u201cThere has to be an argument, doesn\u2019t there, that says instead of Dublin telling this country that we have to stay in the single market etc within the customs union, why doesn\u2019t Dublin, why doesn\u2019t the Republic of Ireland, leave the EU and throw in their lot with this country?\u201d McEntee replied: \u201cTo suggest that we should leave? Ninety-two per cent of Irish people last year said they wanted Ireland to remain part of the European Union and in fact since Brexit that figure has gotten only bigger.\u201d The interview came hours before hundreds of people gathered on the border to protest against Brexit. The Border Communities Against Brexit group, which placed a mock concrete wall and army inspection post on the border just south of Newry, said they were taking \u201ca stand against Brexit, against borders, against division\u201d. \u201cWe never want to see a border on this island again,\u201d they said. The Labour MP Ben Bradshaw tweeted he was \u201cgobsmacked\u201d to hear the BBC suggest \u201cthat the solution to #Brexitshambles is for Ireland to leave the EU &amp; rejoin the UK! Such woeful ignorance of history &amp; of modern day Ireland.\u201d The Irish senator Neale Richmond said this was what Ireland \u201cwas dealing with\u201d in commentary in the UK. McEntee appeared on Today just hours after the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, raised the prospect of police or soldiers being deployed on the border with Northern Ireland in the event of no deal. Varadkar\u2019s statement was criticised by rival politicians, including the leader of Fianna F\u00e1il, Miche\u00e1l Martin, who said it was entirely inconsistent with Ireland\u2019s stance on the border to date. \u201cWhen the taoiseach tells an audience in Davos that the army may have to be sent to the border, he is contradicting everything that we have been told (by him and the t\u00e1naiste [deputy leader]) about preparations. It is hard to see how this helps our case,\u201d he tweeted. Aides later said Varadkar raised the possibility out of frustration that Ireland was being blamed for the impasse in Westminster, where opposition to Theresa May\u2019s deal was not exclusively about the Irish backstop. In an interview with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Varadkar said Ireland had already compromised, but Britain was looking for more while offering nothing in the way of solutions itself. McEntee stuck to that line on the Today programme, saying the UK had given undertakings to ensure there was no return to the borders of the past. In addition, she said, Ireland would hold the UK to its role as co-guarantor of the Good Friday agreement. \u201cFor some reason the onus [in Brexit] \u2026 has been shifted back on to Ireland, that we should compromise, that we are the ones trying to be awkward or difficult. \u201cWe did not vote for Brexit. We don\u2019t believe in it. We respect that it was a democratic decision. We are protecting a peace process. This is not just from an Irish point of view, there is an obligation on the UK to ensure the peace process, the Good Friday agreement is protected and any suggesting that they can walk away from that we simply won\u2019t accept.\u201d",

He outlined his fears in a formal legal warning detailing a number of recurring flaws in care that he sent to the NHS after investigating the death of Gladys Williams. She fell and broke her spine in Wrexham in Wales last April, but it took 12 hours and six minutes after the first 999 call was made before A&amp;E staff began treatment.</p> <p>Gittins was so concerned by failings in her care revealed at the inquest that he issued a strongly worded <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/publications/gladys-williams/\" title=\"\">Prevention of Future Deaths Notice (PFDN)</a> listing several \u201cmatters of concern\u201d and ordering NHS bosses to make urgent changes to reduce the risk of the same things happening again.</p> <p>\u201cThe issues of ambulance delays, admission to [an] emergency department, availability of resources, patient flow and the multifactorial problems associated with cases of this nature have been reported upon by me on numerous occasions following previous inquests,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Although he had issued other reports to both the Welsh Ambulance Service (WAS) and Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, \u201cthese problems appear to be continuing\u201d despite improvements they had made.</p> <p>\u201cI continue to be extremely concerned that patients\u2019 lives are being placed at risk as a result,\u201d he added in the notice, which became public only on 18 January, even though the inquest was held last September. Such extreme strain on the health service is such a regular, year-round occurrence it can no longer be called \u201cwinter pressures\u201d, he said.</p> <p>The Patients Association said the coroner\u2019s findings were \u201cextremely concerning. Delays of many, many hours are completely unacceptable and will put patients\u2019 lives at risk,\u201d said Lucy Watson, its chair.</p> <p>\u201cWe are profoundly concerned that people with life-threatening medical needs are facing these unacceptably long waits. A long wait for people who are frail is more likely to undermine their future wellbeing.

      "bodyText": "Patients\u2019 lives are being put in danger by long delays for vital NHS care, a coroner has warned, following the death of a 93-year-old woman who waited 10 hours for an ambulance and another two to get into A&amp;E. Ambulance hold-ups, staff shortages and the difficulty of getting speedy A&amp;E care have contributed to \u201cnumerous\u201d deaths and may claim more lives, according to John Gittins. He outlined his fears in a formal legal warning detailing a number of recurring flaws in care that he sent to the NHS after investigating the death of Gladys Williams. She fell and broke her spine in Wrexham in Wales last April, but it took 12 hours and six minutes after the first 999 call was made before A&amp;E staff began treatment. Gittins was so concerned by failings in her care revealed at the inquest that he issued a strongly worded Prevention of Future Deaths Notice (PFDN) listing several \u201cmatters of concern\u201d and ordering NHS bosses to make urgent changes to reduce the risk of the same things happening again. \u201cThe issues of ambulance delays, admission to [an] emergency department, availability of resources, patient flow and the multifactorial problems associated with cases of this nature have been reported upon by me on numerous occasions following previous inquests,\u201d he said. Although he had issued other reports to both the Welsh Ambulance Service (WAS) and Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, \u201cthese problems appear to be continuing\u201d despite improvements they had made. \u201cI continue to be extremely concerned that patients\u2019 lives are being placed at risk as a result,\u201d he added in the notice, which became public only on 18 January, even though the inquest was held last September. Such extreme strain on the health service is such a regular, year-round occurrence it can no longer be called \u201cwinter pressures\u201d, he said. The Patients Association said the coroner\u2019s findings were \u201cextremely concerning. Delays of many, many hours are completely unacceptable and will put patients\u2019 lives at risk,\u201d said Lucy Watson, its chair. \u201cWe are profoundly concerned that people with life-threatening medical needs are facing these unacceptably long waits. A long wait for people who are frail is more likely to undermine their future wellbeing. It cannot be acceptable that NHS services have hit a low as bad as this,\u201d she said. Claire Bevan, director of quality and nursing for the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS trust, said it had been working with the health board and councils to address the concerns Gittins raised. \u201cIn response to the report, we offered a collaborative plan to develop alternative pathways in the community for patients. We have particularly focused on managing patients closer to home, reducing demand on emergency departments and helping to keep our emergency ambulances more readily available for responding to life-threatening and serious incidents in the community. \u201cAs a result of collaborative working, we are currently seeing the positive impact of these improvements in our service in the health board area.\u201d The WAS has also come under fire after it emerged that it took almost two days to get an ambulance to 86-year-old dementia patient Mary Duffy after she broke her leg at her care home in Swansea last Sunday. WAS personnel did not arrive until 5.30pm on Tuesday. While she was waiting the WAS told her not to eat, drink or take painkillers, her son Tim said. \u201cMy mother was screaming in pain. I am fuming about the wait she had to endure, although that is not at all directed at the paramedics or hospital staff or staff at the care home. \u201cAll of them were brilliant, but it is the system at fault,\u201d he told Wales Online. A separate inquest last week heard how 78-year-old John Goodson, who had a heart infection, kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, had fallen at his home in Caister, Norfolk, in June last year and lay on the floor for five hours before an ambulance arrived. An official in the NHS ambulance service in England, who did not want to be named, said: \u201cLong delays are occurring sometimes because there is a mismatch between supply and demand. Ambulance services are a finite resource. There are only so many vehicles and staff, and they cannot control, for example, how many drunks need to be taken to hospital.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Even by the demanding standards of the 1960s, <em>Flamingo</em> was considered a groundbreaking magazine. Mixing glamour, sex advice, culture and international politics, it was one of the first magazines to target Britain\u2019s African-Caribbean community.</p> <p>It ran from September 1961 until May 1965 and at its peak sold up to 20,000 copies in the UK and 15,000 in the US. It was also distributed in the Caribbean and West Africa, and published dedicated editions in Nigeria, Ghana and Liberia. It carried interviews with Malcolm X and advertisements for Island Records, which brought Jamaican ska music to Britain.</p> <p>But now it has emerged that <em>Flamingo</em> blazed a trail for another extraordinary reason: its founder, Peter Hornsby, was an agent for the intelligence service, MI6, which used the magazine to push an anti-communist agenda among black and West Indian communities.</p> <p>The revelation came to light after Hornsby\u2019s wife, Jennifer, contacted Stephen Dorril, an author and senior lecturer in the journalism department at Huddersfield University, and told him of her husband\u2019s exploits.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the Notting Hill riots [in 1958] it was thought by my husband and MI6 that something had to be done with regard to helping the West Indian community,\u201d she told Dorril, an expert on the intelligence services who later received a copy of her private memoirs from her son, which contained fascinating details of Hornsby\u2019s life as a spy. Peter died in 2000, Jennifer in 2014.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5987fa8f7ad5666fd381018e9c02ad8edd824dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5987fa8f7ad5666fd381018e9c02ad8edd824dd/85_23_2152_2688/801.jpg\" alt=\"Police search a youth in Talbot Road, Notting Hill during race riots of 1958\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police search a youth in Talbot Road, Notting Hill during race riots of 1958, which prompted the birth of <em>Flamingo</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere were people inside MI6 who saw which way Africa was going in terms of politics and nationalism, and were willing to support black students, writers and aspiring politicians who were on the left but who could be persuaded to oppose communism,\u201d Dorril told the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>\u201cThey had links to centre-left politicians and student leaders in this country who were anti-racist and opposed to the white regimes in Africa. Through subtle propaganda activities such as <em>Flamingo</em>, support could be given to such social democrat initiatives while at the same time providing a pool of potential recruitment both here and in Africa and the Caribbean, where the CIA \u2013 MI6\u2019s main rival \u2013 was a recent interloper.\u201d</p> <p>Hornsby, whose early MI6 handler was George Blake, the Soviet agent, had been groomed by the intelligence services after being elected national treasurer of the National Union of Students in 1955.</p> <p>The following year he took up a post with the Coordinating Secretariat of the National Unions of Students (Cosec), an international anti-communist organisation based in the Dutch city of Leiden, which was also funded by MI6.</p> <p>In the mid-1960s, the Soviets leaked an internal MI6 document \u2013 which Dorril believes was \u201calmost certainly purloined by Blake\u201d \u2013 acknowledging that it was \u201cof paramount importance to maintain as far as possible the illusion of Cosec\u2019s complete independence\u201d. The document continued: \u201cIt seems to us that, if once we attempted to sharpen Cosec as a cold war instrument, we might find it had ceased to have any point at all. Certainly it would be difficult to retain the alliance of member organisations in the uncommitted countries of Asia and Africa, if they suspect that Cosec was being \u2018run\u2019 by the Americans and ourselves.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d90ecc6155b5d13684cb372a562f153b099c0f96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d90ecc6155b5d13684cb372a562f153b099c0f96/248_20_2434_3042/800.jpg\" alt=\"George Blake, the Soviet agent, who was Flamingo founder, Peter Hornsby\u2019s early MI6 handler.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Blake, the Soviet agent, who was <em>Flamingo</em> founder, Peter Hornsby\u2019s early MI6 handler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Deutsch</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Cosec was only one avenue that MI6 was keen to explore with Hornsby. In 1960 another one of his handlers, Margaret Bray, who had once been Kim Philby\u2019s secretary, discussed with Hornsby the idea of setting up a magazine aimed at Afro-Caribbean readers. In addition to pushing an anti-communist agenda, it was a means of monitoring national movements and providing access to potential recruits who could be turned into assets.</p> <p>\u201cIn Peter\u2019s mind, a magazine focusing on immigrants would make them feel welcome and ease their integration into British society,\u201d writes Jennifer Hornsby.</p> <p>A company, Chalton Publishing, was set up to produce the magazine and Edward Scobie, a Dominican who had published <em>Tropic</em>, the first major black journal in Britain, was recruited as editor. Chalton also published <em>Feline</em>, a soft porn magazine aimed at the black community.</p> <p>David Yellop, <em>Flamingo</em>\u2019s art and production manager, told Dorril that Scobie\u2019s attitude to journalism was very \u201crelaxed\u201d and that \u201cattractive young West Indian party girls\u201d were often to be found hanging around the monthly magazine\u2019s office.</p> <p>Dorril said <em>Flamingo</em> was part of a wider programme by the intelligence services to reach out to the black community and dissidents. \u201cIn London in the early 60s, community centres were funded through CIA-approved foundations. They served as a contact point for musicians, authors and other refugees from places such as South Africa. While there is no evidence that they knew of the intelligence background, it is fairly obvious that such activity would be of great interest to MI6 and the CIA.\u201d</p> <p>Shortly before he died in 2001, former senior MI6 officer Montague Woodhouse confirmed to Dorril that the service had run a number of joint operations with the CIA, including sponsorship of the literary magazine <em>Encounter</em>, founded by American political essayist Irving Kristol and English poet Stephen Spender.</p> <p><em>Encounter</em>\u2019s links to both US and British intelligence were exposed in 1967 and led to Spender\u2019s resignation. By that stage <em>Flamingo</em> had closed, ostensibly because it had become financially unviable but possibly because suspicions about its covert funding were starting to emerge.</p> <p>When <em>Flamingo</em> closed, Hornsby\u2019s work as an agent with MI6 also seems to have ceased. He started an antiques business with his wife and became an acknowledged expert on English pewter.</p> <p>There were changes in the magazine in 1964 when its political articles dealing with Africa and the Caribbean became more serious and often had no byline. They are similar in content and style to the material given to media outlets by the Foreign Office\u2019s semi-secret propaganda unit, the Information Research Department.</p>",

Mixing glamour, sex advice, culture and international politics, it was one of the first magazines to target Britain\u2019s African-Caribbean community. It ran from September 1961 until May 1965 and at its peak sold up to 20,000 copies in the UK and 15,000 in the US. It was also distributed in the Caribbean and West Africa, and published dedicated editions in Nigeria, Ghana and Liberia. It carried interviews with Malcolm X and advertisements for Island Records, which brought Jamaican ska music to Britain. But now it has emerged that Flamingo blazed a trail for another extraordinary reason: its founder, Peter Hornsby, was an agent for the intelligence service, MI6, which used the magazine to push an anti-communist agenda among black and West Indian communities. The revelation came to light after Hornsby\u2019s wife, Jennifer, contacted Stephen Dorril, an author and senior lecturer in the journalism department at Huddersfield University, and told him of her husband\u2019s exploits. \u201cAfter the Notting Hill riots [in 1958] it was thought by my husband and MI6 that something had to be done with regard to helping the West Indian community,\u201d she told Dorril, an expert on the intelligence services who later received a copy of her private memoirs from her son, which contained fascinating details of Hornsby\u2019s life as a spy. Peter died in 2000, Jennifer in 2014. \u201cThere were people inside MI6 who saw which way Africa was going in terms of politics and nationalism, and were willing to support black students, writers and aspiring politicians who were on the left but who could be persuaded to oppose communism,\u201d Dorril told the Observer. \u201cThey had links to centre-left politicians and student leaders in this country who were anti-racist and opposed to the white regimes in Africa. Through subtle propaganda activities such as Flamingo, support could be given to such social democrat initiatives while at the same time providing a pool of potential recruitment both here and in Africa and the Caribbean, where the CIA \u2013 MI6\u2019s main rival \u2013 was a recent interloper.\u201d Hornsby, whose early MI6 handler was George Blake, the Soviet agent, had been groomed by the intelligence services after being elected national treasurer of the National Union of Students in 1955. The following year he took up a post with the Coordinating Secretariat of the National Unions of Students (Cosec), an international anti-communist organisation based in the Dutch city of Leiden, which was also funded by MI6. In the mid-1960s, the Soviets leaked an internal MI6 document \u2013 which Dorril believes was \u201calmost certainly purloined by Blake\u201d \u2013 acknowledging that it was \u201cof paramount importance to maintain as far as possible the illusion of Cosec\u2019s complete independence\u201d. The document continued: \u201cIt seems to us that, if once we attempted to sharpen Cosec as a cold war instrument, we might find it had ceased to have any point at all. Certainly it would be difficult to retain the alliance of member organisations in the uncommitted countries of Asia and Africa, if they suspect that Cosec was being \u2018run\u2019 by the Americans and ourselves.\u201d But Cosec was only one avenue that MI6 was keen to explore with Hornsby. In 1960 another one of his handlers, Margaret Bray, who had once been Kim Philby\u2019s secretary, discussed with Hornsby the idea of setting up a magazine aimed at Afro-Caribbean readers. In addition to pushing an anti-communist agenda, it was a means of monitoring national movements and providing access to potential recruits who could be turned into assets. \u201cIn Peter\u2019s mind, a magazine focusing on immigrants would make them feel welcome and ease their integration into British society,\u201d writes Jennifer Hornsby. A company, Chalton Publishing, was set up to produce the magazine and Edward Scobie, a Dominican who had published Tropic, the first major black journal in Britain, was recruited as editor. Chalton also published Feline, a soft porn magazine aimed at the black community. David Yellop, Flamingo\u2019s art and production manager, told Dorril that Scobie\u2019s attitude to journalism was very \u201crelaxed\u201d and that \u201cattractive young West Indian party girls\u201d were often to be found hanging around the monthly magazine\u2019s office. Dorril said Flamingo was part of a wider programme by the intelligence services to reach out to the black community and dissidents. \u201cIn London in the early 60s, community centres were funded through CIA-approved foundations. They served as a contact point for musicians, authors and other refugees from places such as South Africa. While there is no evidence that they knew of the intelligence background, it is fairly obvious that such activity would be of great interest to MI6 and the CIA.\u201d Shortly before he died in 2001, former senior MI6 officer Montague Woodhouse confirmed to Dorril that the service had run a number of joint operations with the CIA, including sponsorship of the literary magazine Encounter, founded by American political essayist Irving Kristol and English poet Stephen Spender. Encounter\u2019s links to both US and British intelligence were exposed in 1967 and led to Spender\u2019s resignation. By that stage Flamingo had closed, ostensibly because it had become financially unviable but possibly because suspicions about its covert funding were starting to emerge. When Flamingo closed, Hornsby\u2019s work as an agent with MI6 also seems to have ceased. He started an antiques business with his wife and became an acknowledged expert on English pewter. There were changes in the magazine in 1964 when its political articles dealing with Africa and the Caribbean became more serious and often had no byline. They are similar in content and style to the material given to media outlets by the Foreign Office\u2019s semi-secret propaganda unit, the Information Research Department.",

There we found a drover and donkey ready to take our luggage.</p> <p>The nature of the trek was soon revealed: five days through a landscape of fabulous mountain panoramas populated by people with not an ounce of spare flesh on them. Farms are mostly a quarter of a hectare \u2013 just over half an acre \u2013 of desperately over-grazed hillside terraces. When the rains allow it, they grow wheat and barley. Some have small flocks of sheep; most have lots of children. None has electricity or running water.

A number of culture-wide structural changes might be to blame: more Americans live alone than ever before; fewer of us are marrying or having children; our average household size is shrinking. In many cases, these changes represent the availability of options where once the only accepted path was marriage and a nuclear family. But they also mean we are spending more time on our own. \u201cWestern societies have demoted human gregariousness from a necessity to an incidental,\u201d writes John Cacioppo, a neuroscientist who studied social pain and passed away in March 2018, in his book<em> </em>Loneliness.</p> <p>The trouble is that chronic loneliness doesn\u2019t just make you feel terrible \u2013 it\u2019s also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/23/seven-ways-overcome-loneliness-mental-health\">terrible for you</a>.

Millions of years of evolution have shaped us into creatures who need social bonds in the same way that we need food and water. And yet we increasingly find ourselves isolated. Loneliness is no longer a powerful enough driver to break us out of the silos created by modern life. Like our insatiable love of high-calorie foods, what was once an adaptive tool has become so misaligned with the way we live that it\u2019s causing, in the words of the former surgeon general Vivek H Murthy, an \u201cepidemic\u201d. It\u2019s hard to compare our collective loneliness against that of previous generations, as we simply haven\u2019t been measuring it consistently, but recent estimates suggest that anywhere from 22% to 75% of American adults are persistently lonely. A number of culture-wide structural changes might be to blame: more Americans live alone than ever before; fewer of us are marrying or having children; our average household size is shrinking. In many cases, these changes represent the availability of options where once the only accepted path was marriage and a nuclear family. But they also mean we are spending more time on our own. \u201cWestern societies have demoted human gregariousness from a necessity to an incidental,\u201d writes John Cacioppo, a neuroscientist who studied social pain and passed away in March 2018, in his book Loneliness. The trouble is that chronic loneliness doesn\u2019t just make you feel terrible \u2013 it\u2019s also terrible for you. Loneliness elevates our risk of developing a range of disorders, including cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, cognitive decline, and metastatic cancer. It also weakens the immune system, making us more susceptible to infections. Left untended, even situational loneliness can ossify into a fixed state that changes brain structures and processes, says Stephanie Cacioppo, director of the Brain Dynamics Lab at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine. She is also John Cacioppo\u2019s widow and was his research partner up until his death last year. As a scientist, Stephanie Cacioppo has often viewed her life as an experiment. When John died, the practical elements of their joint research took on an urgent personal relevance. People sometimes compare social loss to physical pain, but Stephanie finds the analogy inaccurate. After John\u2019s death, she went on long runs, pushing herself in near-freezing temperatures until her muscles and lungs screamed. \u201cI could handle the pain because I knew it would have an end,\u201d she says. \u201cThe physical pain associated with running was less intense than the deep, heartfelt emotional pain of the loss of the love of my life.\u201d Stephanie says she\u2019s now relying on many of the social fitness exercises that the couple validated together, such as making an effort to express gratitude, doing something nice for someone else without expecting something in return, choosing to engage with strangers, and sharing good news with others. \u201cI am living proof of my science,\u201d she says. \u201cI apply it every day.\u201d Unlike depression and anxiety, loneliness has no recognized clinical form; there is no available diagnosis or treatment for feeling chronically isolated.She has also found relief in her work and in continuing her husband\u2019s legacy: \u201cIf you have a sense of worth and life with a purpose, you will feel less lonely,\u201d Stephanie says.

      "bodyText": "The Countdown co-presenter Rachel Riley has revealed she is to be given extra security on the Channel 4 game show after being abused online for her criticism of antisemitism in the Labour party. Riley, who is Jewish, said she had been targeted by Labour supporters on Twitter for her criticisms of the party and its leader, Jeremy Corbyn. She has already spoken about being trolled online, but said the problem had worsened and included physical threats. She told the Times newspaper: \u201cThe more I speak, the more abuse I get, and the more abuse I get, the more I speak. It\u2019s got to the point where I can\u2019t look at my Twitter feed any more \u2026 it\u2019s just a constant stream.\u201d She added: \u201cWe are getting more security for Countdown.\u201d Riley, who has appeared on the programme since 2009, said she believed she was a target for speaking out against antisemitism, and that she did not \u201ctake it lightly\u201d. \u201cWith the hashtag #GetTheToriesOut or the red rose or hashtag #JC4PM, they say to me: \u2018You\u2019re only calling out the left\u2019. Well, I\u2019ve been attacked by people on the left and the best way to not have me talk about antisemitism on the left is not to be antisemitic.\u201d Riley has previously stated that she has no political allegiance and is not a Conservative, although she claims she has been labelled a Tory by supporters of Corbyn. However, she told the Times she would not vote for Labour now, as she believed the party was \u201cactively encouraging the abuse of people who are standing up to this\u201d. Earlier this week, Riley recalled receiving abusive messages for speaking out about antisemitism at the Holocaust Memorial Day reception at the House of Commons. Corbyn has strongly denied allegations of antisemitism within Labour.",

I read most of the novels, and copied all the poems out by hand. I even made a 150-mile pilgrimage to Dorset on my bicycle. My urge to write began with him.

I long to pick up a book and see the words \u201cQuite good\u201d on the front \u2013 or even, \u201cSlightly disappointing\u201d. With my first novel, I toyed with the idea of using a quote from my aunt: \u201cIf I had to read this again,\u201d she\u2019d told a member of my family, in confidence, \u201cI think I\u2019d be sick.\u201d There are lots of overrated books out there, but you can\u2019t tell which ones they are by looking at their covers.

      "bodyText": "The book I\u2019m currently reading I just finished Last Evenings on Earth by Roberto Bola\u00f1o and Passion Simple by Annie Ernaux, both exceptional writers, and am about to plunge into two proof copies I\u2019ve been sent \u2013 The Wisdom of Bones by Kitty Aldridge, and Andrea Lawlor\u2019s Paul Takes the Form of a Mortal Girl. My earliest reading memory The Magic Bed Knob by Mary Norton. I used to love the idea that you could twist a bedknob and fetch up in some unexpected far-flung place. I wonder if my unending desire to live in other countries began with the image of three pyjama-clad children on a brass bed, suddenly and magically finding themselves transported to a beach in the Pacific. The book that influenced my writing I became obsessed with Thomas Hardy when I was 11. I read most of the novels, and copied all the poems out by hand. I even made a 150-mile pilgrimage to Dorset on my bicycle. My urge to write began with him. In my mid-teens, I joined Eastbourne public library, where I discovered books by Isak Dinesen, Vladimir Nabokov and Patrick Modiano. I\u2019ve been reading them ever since. Lastly, Flannery O\u2019Connor has been a kind of literary godmother to me. I\u2019m continually drawn back to books such as The Violent Bear It Away. Her wise, spare sentences. Her quiet savagery. Her compassion. The book that made me cry Only one book has made me cry in recent years \u2013 Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro. The book that is overrated We live in an age of hype and overclaim. Almost every published novel has words like \u201cmesmerising\u201d or \u201cirresistible\u201d on the cover. Are they really all mesmerising and irresistible? It seems unlikely. Publishing is so praise-driven that superlatives have become devalued. I long to pick up a book and see the words \u201cQuite good\u201d on the front \u2013 or even, \u201cSlightly disappointing\u201d. With my first novel, I toyed with the idea of using a quote from my aunt: \u201cIf I had to read this again,\u201d she\u2019d told a member of my family, in confidence, \u201cI think I\u2019d be sick.\u201d There are lots of overrated books out there, but you can\u2019t tell which ones they are by looking at their covers. (Having said that, my latest novel is very definitely \u201ca wonderful achievement\u201d.) The book I give as a gift I used to give people either Coming Through Slaughter or In the Skin of a Lion by Michael Ondaatje because they were beautiful and because nobody had heard of him. But then he won the Booker prize, and I decided he didn\u2019t really need my help any more. The book that changed my life Would it be shameless to mention my own memoir, This Party\u2019s Got to Stop? If I hadn\u2019t started work on it, I would never have thought of looking for my youngest brother, who I hadn\u2019t set eyes on for 23 years. Had I written something else, I doubt I would ever have seen him again. As it is, we\u2019re now in constant contact, and my daughter has a brand-new uncle. The book I wish I\u2019d written If I had to choose just one, it would be The Fruits of the Earth by Andr\u00e9 Gide. It\u2019s a book like no other. A celebration, and a lament. A kind of hymn to the pleasure of being alive. \u2022 Never Anyone But You by Rupert Thomson is published by Corsair.

There was no let-up from either side with the commitment of the players absolute; it cried out for the craft of a player such as Slade but the three-quarters were largely peripheral despite the sustained pace of the game.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/24/rugby-union-obsession-bulk-speed-skill-pat-lambie\">The Breakdown | Rugby union\u2019s obsession with bulk over speed and skill must be reversed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The match in Dublin on Saturday between the two countries who have won the Six Nations since the last World Cup, Ireland last year and England in the two before that, promises to be just as full-blooded and uncompromising. England lacked ball-carriers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/18/ireland-england-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">on their last visit to the Aviva Stadium in March 2017</a>: Billy Vunipola was making his first start of the Six Nations campaign and lacked his usual thrust, his brother Mako was on the bench and the back division then was made up of quick and elusive players.</p> <p>Eddie Jones took the power route in November, Ben Te\u2019o and Joe Cokanasiga starting with Manu Tuilagi on the bench against Australia. With Owen Farrell starting at outside-half instead of George Ford, Slade became the second playmaker at 13, a position he has settled in after starting his senior career at outside-half before being used at 12 and at full-back.</p> <p>\u201cMy game is putting others into space,\u201d he says. \u201cI would not say I am small, but I am not like a typical big ball-carrier. I am an extra playmaker and communicator for the side so that we take opportunities when they come.\u201d</p> <p>Slade was first capped by England before the 2015 World Cup, partnering Sam Burgess in the midfield against France at Twickenham. He was chosen in the squad for the tournament but played only in the match against Uruguay at the end of the group stage when England had no hope of making the knockout stage, again at 13. He missed Jones\u2019s first Six Nations campaign because of injury and has tasted only five minutes of action in the championship, against Italy as a replacement in 2017, but he went to Portugal last week to prepare for the encounter against Ireland having started six of England\u2019s last seven internationals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</strong><br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cLast year was a really good one for me with England and Exeter,\u201d says Slade. \u201cIt was disappointing not to win the Premiership again and we are doing everything this season to put ourselves in a position to give it another shot. I was pleased to get the amount of game time that I had with England and I am trying to do enough to make sure I keep the shirt.</p> <p>\u201cI feel that 13 is my position now, although I am happy to play anywhere. It does not really matter what number you have on your back, even in defence at set pieces because you can set up with 13 defending at 12. When it comes to phase play, most teams have players across the pitch who can handle and the attacking shape is pretty fluid so your number does not have too much bearing.\u201d</p> <p>England started last year\u2019s Six Nations with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/04/italy-england-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">comfortable victory over Italy</a> in Rome and held on to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/10/england-wales-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">overcome Wales at Twickenham</a> before the chariot became stuck in reverse. A first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/24/scotland-england-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">defeat to Scotland</a> for 10 years was followed by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/10/france-england-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">loss against France</a> in Paris before Ireland came to Twickenham and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/17/england-ireland-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">clinched the grand slam</a>. It was England\u2019s first home defeat in the championship since 2012 and they lost the first two Tests in South Africa the following June.</p> <p>\u201cSport is not all smooth sailing,\u201d says Slade. \u201cWe had a good run a while ago and last year we suffered a bit of a dip. That is when you learn a lot about yourselves: we took some criticism and that gives you the kick up the arse that you need because it is in adversity that you find your true character and become fired by the desire to do better. We finished the South Africa series with a victory and had some good performances and results in the autumn. I think we are in a really good space going into the Six Nations and as a squad we are confident.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/23/joe-schmidt-ireland-brutal-six-nations-opener-england\">Ireland\u2019s Joe Schmidt prepares to host England in \u2018brutal\u2019 Six Nations opener | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jones has changed his approach to this year\u2019s Six Nations after their worst campaign since 2006. His squad for the eight days in Portugal was made up entirely of players he believed would be fit for selection against Ireland. That initially meant there was no place for the player who Slade replaced in the side in South Africa, Jonathan Joseph, who made his first appearance of the season for Bath at Toulouse last weekend. After playing for 52 minutes and suffering no ill-effects, Joseph was called up, but having made just one appearance since the middle of last April he would appear to be more in line for a place on the bench than a starting position.</p> <p>\u201cI am in possession of the jersey but there is a lot of competition and players are putting their hands up,\u201d says Slade. \u201cI was pleased with how it went in November, when in our only defeat we pushed New Zealand all the way and had a late try disallowed, and am looking forward, if selected, to helping us build on that. Eddie keeps in touch, texting after games to say how he thinks things have gone and in this environment you can never stand still.</p> <p>\u201cWe intend to use the Six Nations to keep building and make sure that we are in the best place possible when the World Cup kicks off. We have the toughest of starts in the Six Nations away to Ireland. They will be the favourites after all they have achieved, but it is an exciting prospect for us to go there and try and do a job on them in their own backyard. We will be ready.\u201d</p>",

Exeter\u2019s Champions Cup match at Munster last weekend was an example of how an attempt to wear down opponents now goes on for 80 minutes. There was no let-up from either side with the commitment of the players absolute; it cried out for the craft of a player such as Slade but the three-quarters were largely peripheral despite the sustained pace of the game. The match in Dublin on Saturday between the two countries who have won the Six Nations since the last World Cup, Ireland last year and England in the two before that, promises to be just as full-blooded and uncompromising. England lacked ball-carriers on their last visit to the Aviva Stadium in March 2017: Billy Vunipola was making his first start of the Six Nations campaign and lacked his usual thrust, his brother Mako was on the bench and the back division then was made up of quick and elusive players. Eddie Jones took the power route in November, Ben Te\u2019o and Joe Cokanasiga starting with Manu Tuilagi on the bench against Australia. With Owen Farrell starting at outside-half instead of George Ford, Slade became the second playmaker at 13, a position he has settled in after starting his senior career at outside-half before being used at 12 and at full-back. \u201cMy game is putting others into space,\u201d he says. \u201cI would not say I am small, but I am not like a typical big ball-carrier. I am an extra playmaker and communicator for the side so that we take opportunities when they come.\u201d Slade was first capped by England before the 2015 World Cup, partnering Sam Burgess in the midfield against France at Twickenham. He was chosen in the squad for the tournament but played only in the match against Uruguay at the end of the group stage when England had no hope of making the knockout stage, again at 13. He missed Jones\u2019s first Six Nations campaign because of injury and has tasted only five minutes of action in the championship, against Italy as a replacement in 2017, but he went to Portugal last week to prepare for the encounter against Ireland having started six of England\u2019s last seven internationals. \u201cLast year was a really good one for me with England and Exeter,\u201d says Slade. \u201cIt was disappointing not to win the Premiership again and we are doing everything this season to put ourselves in a position to give it another shot. I was pleased to get the amount of game time that I had with England and I am trying to do enough to make sure I keep the shirt. \u201cI feel that 13 is my position now, although I am happy to play anywhere. It does not really matter what number you have on your back, even in defence at set pieces because you can set up with 13 defending at 12. When it comes to phase play, most teams have players across the pitch who can handle and the attacking shape is pretty fluid so your number does not have too much bearing.\u201d England started last year\u2019s Six Nations with a comfortable victory over Italy in Rome and held on to overcome Wales at Twickenham before the chariot became stuck in reverse. A first defeat to Scotland for 10 years was followed by a loss against France in Paris before Ireland came to Twickenham and clinched the grand slam. It was England\u2019s first home defeat in the championship since 2012 and they lost the first two Tests in South Africa the following June. \u201cSport is not all smooth sailing,\u201d says Slade. \u201cWe had a good run a while ago and last year we suffered a bit of a dip. That is when you learn a lot about yourselves: we took some criticism and that gives you the kick up the arse that you need because it is in adversity that you find your true character and become fired by the desire to do better. We finished the South Africa series with a victory and had some good performances and results in the autumn. I think we are in a really good space going into the Six Nations and as a squad we are confident.\u201d Jones has changed his approach to this year\u2019s Six Nations after their worst campaign since 2006. His squad for the eight days in Portugal was made up entirely of players he believed would be fit for selection against Ireland. That initially meant there was no place for the player who Slade replaced in the side in South Africa, Jonathan Joseph, who made his first appearance of the season for Bath at Toulouse last weekend. After playing for 52 minutes and suffering no ill-effects, Joseph was called up, but having made just one appearance since the middle of last April he would appear to be more in line for a place on the bench than a starting position. \u201cI am in possession of the jersey but there is a lot of competition and players are putting their hands up,\u201d says Slade. \u201cI was pleased with how it went in November, when in our only defeat we pushed New Zealand all the way and had a late try disallowed, and am looking forward, if selected, to helping us build on that. Eddie keeps in touch, texting after games to say how he thinks things have gone and in this environment you can never stand still. \u201cWe intend to use the Six Nations to keep building and make sure that we are in the best place possible when the World Cup kicks off. We have the toughest of starts in the Six Nations away to Ireland. They will be the favourites after all they have achieved, but it is an exciting prospect for us to go there and try and do a job on them in their own backyard. We will be ready.\u201d",

That vote has been delayed until March, but in the meantime, like Songer, Culp says he will not enforce.</p> <p>The sheriff in Ferry county, Ray Maycumber, told the Guardian that he would not be enforcing the laws either, at least until the NRA\u2019s litigation is completed.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a window of time when I get to make the assessment\u201d, he said.

      "bodyText": "In Washington state, a freshly implemented ballot initiative and a raft of new bills may produce some of the tightest firearms regulations in the US. But standing in the way is a group of rural law enforcement officers who say point blank that they won\u2019t enforce any of it. The Klickitat county sheriff, Bob Songer, is one of them. He told the Guardian that the initiative passed last November \u201cis unconstitutional on several grounds. I\u2019ve taken the position that as an elected official, I am not going to enforce that law\u201d. Songer also cited ongoing litigation by the National Rife Association gun industry lobby and others which aims to demonstrate the laws violate both the second amendment and the state\u2019s constitution. He also said that if other agencies attempted to seize weapons from county residents under the auspices of the new laws, he would consider preventively \u201cstanding in their doorway\u201d. In November, the state\u2019s voters handily passed an initiative, I-1639, which mostly targeted semi-automatic rifles. As of 1 January, purchasers of these weapons must now be over 21, undergo an enhanced background check, must have completed a safety course, and need to wait 9 days to take possession of their weapon. Also, gun owners who fail to store their weapons safely risk felony \u201ccommunity endangerment\u201d charges. Feeling the wind at their backs after the ballot, gun campaigners and liberal legislators have now gone even further in the new legislative session. Bills introduced in the last week to Washington\u2019s Democrat-dominated legislature look to further restrict firearms. Some laws would ban high capacity magazines and plastic guns made with 3D printers. Others would mandate training for concealed carry permits, and remove guns and ammo during and after domestic violence incidents. Washington\u2019s attorney general, Bob Ferguson, who proposed several of the bills, said in an email: \u201cNow is the time to act. Washingtonians have made it clear that they support common-sense gun safety reforms.\u201d Kristen Ellingboe, from Washington\u2019s Alliance for Gun Safety, which has long campaigned for more firearms restrictions, said that \u201cfor a long time our elected officials thought that gun violence protection was somehow controversial, but they have been behind where the people of Washington are on this issue\u201d. But like other west coast states, Washington exhibits a deep cultural and political divide between its populous, coastal cities and its more sparsely populated rural hinterland. I-1639 passed on a roughly 60-40 split; in the big, blue counties west of the Cascade Mountains, such as King county, where Seattle is located, the margins were even bigger. However, 27 of Washington\u2019s 39 counties rejected the ballot measure. Many of those counties are in the state\u2019s more rural, sparsely populated districts. It is in these counties that many \u2013 including sworn officers \u2013 are promising to resist the laws. In Ferry county in eastern Washington, more than 72% of voters rejected I-1639. In the county\u2019s only incorporated city, Republic, the police chief Loren Culp asked the council in November to declare the city a \u201csecond amendment sanctuary\u201d. That vote has been delayed until March, but in the meantime, like Songer, Culp says he will not enforce. The sheriff in Ferry county, Ray Maycumber, told the Guardian that he would not be enforcing the laws either, at least until the NRA\u2019s litigation is completed. \u201cThere\u2019s a window of time when I get to make the assessment\u201d, he said. Should the NRA not succeed, he said, he would \u201cconsider if I want to go on in the job\u201d. The \u201csanctuary\u201d idea has caught on with other rightwing activists. Matt Marshall is the leader of the Washington Three Percent, a patriot movement group which has held several open carry rallies in downtown Seattle in the last year. Marshall is attempting to persuade rural Washington counties to adopt local second amendment sanctuary ordinances. Next week, together with the Patriot Prayer founder and former Senate candidate Joey Gibson, he is addressing a meeting of Lewis and Pierce counties to try to persuade them to adopt resolutions which would mean that the gun laws were not enforced. The refusal of law enforcement officers to enforce the new restrictions plays into a longer history of so-called \u201cconstitutional\u201d sheriffs resisting the gradual tightening of gun laws. There are also hints, in the stance, of the doctrine of \u201ccounty supremacy\u201d, long nursed on the constitutionalist far right, which holds that county sheriffs are the highest constitutional authority in the country. Such notions have long been promoted by figures like sheriff Richard Mack, who leads the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association. As gun laws throughout the west have gradually tightened in recent decades, resistance along these lines has become prevalent in areas with strong political support for gun rights. Since the initiative passed, and they made their positions public, both Songer and Culp have been lionized in conservative media. Earlier this month, Songer detailed his position on the Alex Jones show, where he appeared with Gibson. On this resistance to the new wave of gun restrictions in Washington, Ellingboe, the gun safety campaigner, said that \u201cit\u2019s disappointing that the gun lobby is trying to undermine the will of Washington voters\u201d.",

At first, I attributed this to the darkness and gloom of the winter days. But as I started to feel better \u2013 calmer, happier, more even-keeled \u2013 a more sinister thought began to nag at me. Had I been in withdrawal?</p> <p>My decision to stop sugar was taken on a whim. Back then, aside from its role in tooth decay, I knew little about its possible effects on health. But when I discovered how much better I felt without it, I became curious \u2013 and began to read.</p> <p>To a chemist, <em>sugar</em> refers to a class of molecules made of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen; some of these serve particular biological roles. Lactose, for example, is found in milk; deoxyribose gives the \u201cD\u201d to DNA. But in daily life, the main sugars one meets are glucose, fructose and sucrose \u2013 which is a marriage of the other two. That is, each molecule of sucrose is one glucose linked to one fructose. Interestingly, the two simple sugars have the same chemical formula \u2013 six atoms of carbon, 12 of hydrogen, six of oxygen \u2013 but different chemical structures. The human tongue detects this: fructose tastes sweeter.</p> <p>Glucose is synonymous with blood sugar, since it is transported in the blood and delivered to cells to fuel their energetic needs. But you can also find it, along with fructose, in fruits and vegetables. Sucrose is extracted from sugar cane or beets, and is usually encountered as the white crystals of table sugar. When most people speak of \u201csugar\u201d, they mean sucrose. High-fructose corn syrup, the most common sweetener of non-diet soft drinks, is a mixture of glucose and fructose. So is honey \u2013 though honey is a complex concoction that contains many other compounds.</p> <p>The history of sugar is full of darkness. The European appetite for sweetness drove the slave trade; according to one estimate, in the Americas, two-thirds of enslaved Africans worked on sugar cane plantations. Sugar is also implicated in lung cancer. How? Because the tobacco in blended cigarettes has typically been soaked in sugar syrups; this makes the smoke easier to take into the lungs.</p> <p>The grim harvest does not stop there. A growing number of doctors blame sugar consumption for a long list of medical woes. These include diabetes, obesity, hypertension, heart disease, gout, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, many cancers and perhaps even Alzheimer\u2019s. Some researchers have even linked the eating of sugar in childhood to the development of myopia, arguing that the spikes in insulin secretion caused by sugar consumption interfere with the normal development of the eyes. In short: the recent medical literature about sugar makes alarming reading.</p> <p>Such connections are, of course, disputed. But as an evolutionary biologist, as well as someone who has felt the immediate benefits of a sugar-free lifestyle, I find the claims persuasive. For most of human history, after all, milk, honey and fruits have been the main sources of sweetness. When cane sugar first made its way to Europe around 1,000 years ago, it was treated as a spice, a medicine and a preservative.</p> <p>In 1700, the average sugar consumption in the United Kingdom was around two kilograms per person per year. Today, the figure is 10 times that amount. Over the past 300 years, sugars have thus gone from an occasional luxury to a substantial component of the average western diet. The present sugar glut is an anomaly in human experience. We have changed the world to suit our appetites; but our bodies cannot accommodate the change.</p> <p>Different foods have different effects on the body. To see this, look no further than sugars. Intake of glucose directly stimulates the production of the hormone insulin; that of fructose does not. Fructose, instead, is metabolised in the liver, where it is turned into fat. Indeed, evidence is mounting that fructose is a major player in metabolic illness. When you consume table sugar, you get both fructose and glucose, because the sucrose is chopped into its component parts. Repeatedly consuming vast quantities of these substances \u2013 as when you eat lots of sugary food or drink lots of sodas \u2013 could thus cause a double whammy of metabolic disturbance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">.</a> </figure>  <p><strong>In my new life, I don\u2019t eat foods with added sugar</strong>.

Animal manures used to help plants grow can be contaminated with infectious diseases such as E coli and listeria, as well as persistent herbicides. While manure-borne salmonella or campylobacter could make you ill, persistent herbicides could kill your crops, which rather defeats the point of adding manure. Instead, make your own compost from layers of nitrogen-rich green material (grass cuttings, peelings, leafy prunings) and carbon-rich brown material (dry leaves, straw, card, shredded woody prunings), sourced from kitchen, household and garden waste. The pile needs to be moist and warm to decompose through microbial action. Turn with a garden fork every month or two, and in six months you should have enough black, crumbly compost to grow your plants in.

      "bodyText": "24 Perhaps the quintessential box-set show. 24 was so propulsive and relentless, swinging from cliffhanger to cliffhanger, that you\u2019d almost always feast on more episodes than you intended and wind up groggy and unresponsive the following day. This even goes for the years when it became a carnival sideshow version of itself. The Americans This saga of two Russian agents posing as a married couple in 1980s Washington, DC is the thinking person\u2019s spy thriller, elegant and cerebral but with tense jeopardy in every scene. A precisely judged blend of jittery espionage action and the timeless drama of everyone living their own lie. Arrested Development The Easter egg-filled US sitcom, cancelled by Fox back in 2006, got a second wind via DVDs (remember those?) and a little website called Netflix. With its frantic, reality TV-inspired pace, constant callbacks and bizarro bit-parts for everyone from Liza Minnelli to Ben Stiller, it gave the family comedy an injection of meta weirdness. Atlanta Donald Glover\u2019s dramedy about a wannabe rapper and his drifter cousin is a rare thing, mixing malleable realism with smart pop culture references to everything from former child stars (Teddy Perkins) to Rachel Dolezal-in-reverse transracialism (B.A.N). Its scattergun approach to genre makes for a superficially easy watch, but its themes will rattle around in your head long after the credits roll. Bodyguard He was a former British soldier with PTSD, she was the home secretary \u2013 can we make it any more obvious? The show that marked the return of appointment viewing spliced together terrorism, political intrigue, mental illness and a \u201cwill they/won\u2019t they\u201d tension to create disarmingly brilliant TV with a deeper message. Breaking Bad Forget its cultural significance, and forget about its presence on Netflix; there was once a time when Breaking Bad was the best-kept secret on television. Not for too long, however: the show ended up winning 16 Emmys and spawning surprisingly successful spin-off Better Call Saul, and is a pivotal series in the history of TV. It was one of the first to be credited as inflicting the \u201cbingeable\u201d box-set curse on its viewers. The Comeback The post-Friends spotlight was on Matt LeBlanc\u2019s Joey and the offscreen romances of Jennifer Aniston. But Lisa Kudrow stole a march on both as Valerie Cherish, the washed-up comedy actor given a second bite at the entertainment cherry with an unforgiving reality vehicle. Cherish is so scintillatingly close to nervous breakdown, so in love with the diminishing returns of the old star system that, by the time she gets to record I Will Survive for the show\u2019s theme song, there is nothing but lunacy left in her eyes. Twenty-five years after Robert De Niro found the profound sadness of becoming the King of Comedy, Kudrow immortalised its hollow Queen. Curb Your Enthusiasm Seinfeld co-creator Larry David played his misanthropic personality for laughs in Curb, which began life as a one-off mockumentary in 1999. While its 2017 comeback received patchy reviews, its outrageous, largely improvised misunderstandings on everything from paedophilia to the Holocaust remain some of the most brilliantly wince-worthy TV ever made. Dear White People Based on the 2014 film of the same name, this dramedy centres on race relations and intersectionality at a fictional US Ivy League college. It also boasts a teen soapiness and references to everything from Stacey Dash\u2019s career missteps to Scandal that remind us that this is a show about the black millennial experience as well as activism. Dexter Swathe your sofa in plastic: this is the perfect sinful binge, with Michael C Hall as the emotionless forensics guy who kills the killers his cop colleagues can\u2019t catch.

And sometimes naked, yes. Society would rather watch Westeros descend into petty, horny tribalism than the real world any day. Girls Lena Dunham\u2019s crass public behaviour makes it more miraculous that she is the master of the modern half-hour dramedy. So many young TV auteurs have failed to emulate Dunham\u2019s knack for elliptical, off-kilter scripts that tell you everything you need about characters who don\u2019t fit any stereotype. With the stories artfully leaving gaps for online debate to fill, the reaction to Girls at times made it feel like a modish provocation, but beneath the observations about the alien world of pampered millennial Brooklyn is a rare emotional intelligence and humour. The Good Place Set in a pastel-hued afterlife populated by virtuous, philanthropic sorts who can\u2019t even swear and, er, someone who got in by accident, The Good Place was Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur\u2019s attempt at channelling Lost, via the great philosophers and, presumably, The Sims. The result is a meta comedy that\u2019s forking great. The Handmaid\u2019s Tale Margaret Atwood\u2019s tale of near-future oppression was never going to make for a sunshine-and-rainbows kind of show.

Lost Nothing can fully replicate the experience of watching the broadcast run of Lost \u2013 back when online recaps and deep-dive Easter egg analyses were in their infancy \u2013 but the box sets run a close second, not least because they allow you to pummel your way through the hellish third series in a single weekend. Nighty Night Julia Davis has been funnier and more disgusting since, but Nighty Night still stands out as her best work.

Without \u201cchilled-out entertainer\u201d David Brent we may never had a generation of deluded Apprentice contestants who thought they were also \u201cthe reflection of perfection\u201d, or indeed the \u201csadcom\u201d trend that has dominated the past decade. Search Party When an old college frenemy goes missing, four Brooklyn stooges step in to sketch the story out. Like Scooby Doo-conceived by the cast of Girls, the drama wide-frames out in inch-perfect pincer movements to become a satire on the vainglorious inflate/deflate culture of social media. The chasm between what we say we are and what we really are in the digital age presides like the hangman\u2019s arch over two seasons of drama and wit. The Sopranos The Sopranos is still a top-five-of-all-time television series. Imbibe it via box set and you can watch the thing expand in real time, from a drama about a mob boss in therapy to a genuinely poetic meditation on life and death. Succession Where the hell was Jesse Armstrong\u2019s resplendent family saga at the Emmys? This contender for best show of 2018 stars Brian Cox as an irascible Murdoch-alike, keeping the ambitious teeth of his offspring from his ankles as his health fails. King Lear in New York with Armstrong\u2019s trademark The Thick of It smart talk and ugly truth. Pure gold. Summer Heights High Chris Lilley essays the Australian school system through three malfunctioning antiheroes: Ja\u2019mie King, the monstrous private school girl going public; Mr G, the egomaniacal musical theatre darling; and Jonah Takalua, the aggro boy for whom education has failed. These dissonant character sketches bring class warfare, horror, humour, occasional warmth and all the raw terrors of being a teenager. This Is England Fleshed out from Shane Meadows\u2019s stunning film, the director spans the late 80s with a bunch of friends negotiating adulthood. In every graffitied strip-mall there are echoes of This Is England\u2019s casually destitute braying youth who learned survival from one another while successive governments looked purposefully away. The \u201cIs\u201d in the title was always its pertinent masterstroke. The West Wing Although it doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny as much as many other shows \u2013 even before Aaron Sorkin left, it often functioned as a wheelbarrow for his hubris \u2013 The West Wing was nevertheless capable of hitting extraordinary heights. And, you know, why not wallow in a show with an American president whom people actually like? The Wire Artfully fleshed-out characters, institutional corruption, skilful story arcs \u2026 the Baltimore-set series was likened to a Greek tragedy by its creator David Simon, a comparison that perfectly encapsulates the themes of fate and futility at its core. As well as seriously upping expectations for cop shows, it also introduced the world to one Idris Elba as Adam Smith-reading gangster Stringer Bell.",

      "body": "<p>I first heard <a href=\"https://www.dau.xxx/\" title=\"\">about Dau</a> five years ago, and have been figuratively banging on the door ever since, to no avail. Two weeks ago, the door opened \u2013 literally. I am invited to a mansion block on London\u2019s Piccadilly where, behind an anonymous black door, lies another world. The lobby is dimly, atmospherically lit \u2013 a room out of a David Lynch movie. A man in a 1940s-style suit and hat stands pulling back the curtain and peeking on to the street \u2013 except he turns out to be a mannequin. A bald security guard with a Russian accent takes my signature and photograph. Photography and recording are forbidden. A friendly American woman guides me through labyrinthine corridors painted black and red and grey, the walls plastered with Soviet-era posters and photos. There are more mannequins in vintage costumes in startling places: hanging from a chandelier, kneeling and kissing a Soviet flag. There is a large mannequin workshop. There are modern editing suites behind frosted glass walls. There is a restaurant serving Georgian cuisine, and a function room in 1940s-style decor. The sound of a dog barking carries down the corridor. \u201cThat\u2019s a real dog, by the way,\u201d my guide says. You can\u2019t be too sure.</p> <p>I am here to watch some films. Dau is a film project, or at least, it began as one. Now, nobody knows how to describe it. It has been called a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/31/stalinist-truman-show-artist-paid-400-people-to-live-as-soviet-citizens\" title=\"\">\u201cStalinist Truman Show\u201d</a>, a serious anthropological experiment, even a \u201cSoviet Love Island\u201d. In scale, it has been compared to infamous movie shoots that spiralled out of control, such as Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s Apocalypse Now. But Dau also has echoes of the <a href=\"https://www.prisonexp.org/\" title=\"\">Stanford prison experiment</a> \u2013 in which students<strong> </strong>lost sight of the fact that they were playing a role, acting as guards and prisoners rather too enthusiastically. Stanford\u2019s experiment had to be shut down after six days; Dau\u2019s continued for three years.</p> <p>Dau began in 2005 as a conventional biopic of a real-life Russian scientist named <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Landau\" title=\"\">Lev Landau</a>. Landau worked with pioneering quantum physicists such as Niels Bohr, had a hand in the Soviet atomic weapons programme, and won <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1962/landau/biographical/\" title=\"\">a Nobel prize</a> in 1962. He took an experimental approach to sex and drugs as well as science, living by his belief that marriage should be no impediment to sexual freedom (his wife, Kora, was less enthusiastic). The film\u2019s director was Ilya Khrzhanovsky, a then 29-year-old Russian with just one previous work to his name \u2013 a challenging, hallucinatory drama titled <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445161/\" title=\"\">4</a>, which had won considerable acclaim. The Greek-born conductor <a href=\"http://www.teodor-currentzis.com/index.php/about/\" title=\"\">Teodor Currentzis</a> was cast as the lead, simply named Dau. Non-actors made up the majority of the huge cast \u2013 400 principal actors and 10,000 extras.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"1c6c485888c0cf25c68ebbd9da078a8a276f64f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c6c485888c0cf25c68ebbd9da078a8a276f64f4/0_0_1565_1037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greek actor Maria Nafpliotou, who plays Dau\u2019s former lover, Maria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greek actor Maria Nafpliotou, who plays Dau\u2019s former lover, Maria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phenomen IP, 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The central location of Dau was a Soviet research institute, inspired by the secret facility in which Landau lived and worked from the late 30s until his death in 1968. About a year into shooting, in 2009, a gigantic set, the size of two football pitches, was constructed at an abandoned swimming baths in Kharkiv, north-east Ukraine. But when it was completed, Khrzhanovsky abandoned the idea of finishing the film to focus exclusively on his replica institute, now also known as Dau.</p> <p>It became less a film set than a parallel world: a functioning mini-state, stuck in the mid-20th century and sealed off from the modern world. Dau was populated with hundreds of extras, or \u201cparticipants\u201d, who lived as faithfully as possible as Soviet citizens. The period authenticity was obsessive, covering clothes (even down to the underwear), hairstyles, food packaging, cigarette brands. What is more, time moved forwards inside Dau, from 1938 to 1968, so all the period detail was continually updated. Participants were paid in Russian roubles, which could be spent on set. (Some of the older extras, playing caretakers, smuggled in their own roubles saved from the Soviet era and tried to spend them; they were reprimanded for using \u201cfake\u201d money.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5f950f7a06871541a7c4d591fe1a8b96cdf82774\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f950f7a06871541a7c4d591fe1a8b96cdf82774/0_260_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Participants were paid in Russian roubles, which could be spent on set.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Participants were paid in Russian roubles, which could be spent on set.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phenomen IP, 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dau\u2019s cast of non-actors was drawn from a nationwide database of auditionees compiled by the producers. The number of videotaped auditions fluctuates between 210,000 and 392,000, depending on who you ask; many of Dau\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d statistics are all but unverifiable. Roles were played by people who had played those roles for real: cleaners, waitresses, academics, party officials, shamans, artists; even, sometimes, criminals and real-life neo-Nazis, the latter of whom brought the project to a close by helping to destroy the set in \u201c1968\u201d. Scientists who visited or took up temporary residency there included Nobel-prize-winning physicist <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2004/gross/biographical\" title=\"\">David Gross</a>, neuroscientist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_H._Fallon\" title=\"\">James Fallon</a>, and Harvard maths professor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shing-Tung_Yau\" title=\"\">Shing-Tung Yau</a>. The artists included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/marina-abramovic\" title=\"\">Marina Abramovi\u0107</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/carsten-holler\" title=\"\">Carsten H\u00f6ller</a> and theatre director Peter Sellars.</p> <p>The weirdest thing was, hardly any of this was actually filmed. This was not a giant Big Brother house; there were no hidden cameras. A single cinematographer \u2013 German veteran J\u00fcrgen J\u00fcrges \u2013 roamed the set with a three-person crew. Between 2009 and 2011, he filmed 700 hours of footage \u2013 only a fraction of the duration of the \u201cexperiment\u201d. The rest of the time, people apparently went about their Soviet business, unobserved.</p> <p>The Scottish producer Eddie Dick got a taste of Dau in 2011, when he went to Ukraine to discuss a potential collaboration between Khrzhanovsky and director Nicolas Roeg. The induction process was meticulous, he tells me. He and his colleague were given a crib sheet of facts about 1953 \u2013 the current year inside Dau. They were dressed in period costume; Dick\u2019s hair was cut; new spectacles with more period-appropriate frames were quickly ordered from a local optician. They were given \u201cpassports\u201d and some (real) roubles. On the threshold of the set, their papers were checked by guards and they were interrogated about the purpose of their visit.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if everybody started doing things when we appeared, but certainly everybody was doing what they were supposed to be doing,\u201d Dick says. Armed guards were marching up and down. People were eating in the cafe; three or four scientists were conducting experiments in the laboratory with electromagnetic guns. The journalists were preparing the newspaper of the day. The architects were poring over a plan of a Kharkiv of the future \u2013 as in, the 1960s. He even visited Dau\u2019s apartment and met his wife, Nora, played by the Russian actor Radmila Shchyogoleva. \u201cA tiny babushka opened the door. Nora floated downstairs in an elegant dress and had tea with us for half an hour. She was in character the whole time. The illusion was kept up by everyone and everything,\u201d Dick says. \u201cWe never broke the rules, either. I never turned to anyone and said, \u2018Come on. What the fuck\u2019s going on here?\u2019 You found yourself mesmerised by the facade, and we just went along with it.\u201d But throughout Dick\u2019s visit, he saw no filming taking place.</p> <p>Some people allegedly moved to Ukraine and lived at Dau for months, even years, eating, working and sleeping on the set. Others came and went quickly, convinced that this recreation of a totalitarian state had morphed into something genuinely oppressive and dark. Rumours began to circulate that Khrzhanovsky was as interested in sex and power as he was in art. Rather than Coppola\u2019s shoot of Apocalypse Now, Dau began to sound like the heart of darkness itself: an entire world cut off from civilisation, living by its own rules, with Khrzhanovsky as its Colonel Kurtz figure, a film-maker gone rogue.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The reason Dau\u2019s door opened to me is that, nearly 15 years after its inception, the project is finally ready to show to the public. Three immersive exhibitions are planned for this year, in Paris, London, then Berlin. Before the opening, I am promised an interview with Khrzhanovsky in Paris. First, though, I am required to watch at least four of the 13 feature films that have been edited from 700 hours of footage from the institute. (More is planned: a TV series, documentaries, and, at some point, a cinema release for the original Dau movie.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a820ee7f424d2e6f05cfbdc53cb5d182fbe3011\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a820ee7f424d2e6f05cfbdc53cb5d182fbe3011/173_738_2868_3583/800.jpg\" alt=\"Director Ilya Khrzhanovsky\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Director Ilya Khrzhanovsky.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phenomen IP, 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first three films I am shown are a trilogy centring on Nora. The films are in Russian with no subtitles, but through an earpiece a monotone voice narrates the English translation. In the first, Nora\u2019s mother comes to visit her at the institute \u2013 which looks less like a genuine Soviet facility than a postmodern fantasia based on one. In the second film, Dau (Currentzis) is visited by his former lover, a beautiful Greek woman named Maria. Nora is away, but then returns unexpectedly.</p> <p>The third film, set more than a decade later, is more startling. Dau has considerably aged and is almost bedridden (the real Lev Landau had a debilitating car accident in 1962; he died in 1968). His son Denis has grown up into an eccentric man-child. Nora is bored and lonely. There is incest, and prolonged scenes of graphic, unsimulated sex. In the fourth film, the institute\u2019s caretakers get drunk on vodka. An old lady vomits copiously. Then, for the bulk of the film, two men, Sasha and Valera, embark on a night of drunken passion that swings between tenderness, clumsy sex and physical and verbal abuse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"f5324bf3513a17eac64dba50764412d8063c369b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5324bf3513a17eac64dba50764412d8063c369b/0_175_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lev Landau lectures students in a scene from the original film, for which Khrzhanovsky plans a cinema release.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lev Landau lectures students in a scene from the original film, for which Khrzhanovsky plans a cinema release.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phenomen IP, 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The films are both exhilarating and boring. There are long, rambling dialogue scenes with very few cuts (J\u00fcrges shoots with a single camera). But there is an authentic emotional rawness and intensity to the drama. The experience is closer to watching a documentary, or perhaps a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogme_95\" title=\"\">Danish Dogme film</a>, like Lars von Trier\u2019s The Idiots.</p> <p>The true scale of the project becomes apparent when I am shown a 10-minute trailer for the original, still unfinished Dau movie, which looks appetisingly epic: vast crowds, 1930s street scenes, a huge replica <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalinin_K-7\" title=\"\">Soviet propeller plane</a>. There are countless striking images: a masked ball, a church bell crashing to the ground, piles of rotten cabbages, women smashing up clay rabbits on a production line.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ea87a84396aa9605c9f0cdd539b6b2d3f7f6c35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ea87a84396aa9605c9f0cdd539b6b2d3f7f6c35/0_134_2279_1367/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Time moved forward on set from \u20181938\u2019 to \u20181968\u2019.

Supplementary information is available on each character in any scene: biographies, photo galleries, documentation such as passports and letters.</p> <p>Scanning this brings up a bewildering panoply of images: Abramovi\u0107 (in 50s costume) undergoing a purification ritual by a shaman; Fallon discussing capitalism at a dinner party; Dau standing over a naked man and woman having sex (there is always at least one screen playing sexual content). An official abusing a tearful, naked woman in a prison cell; shockingly, he forces her to drink cognac, then to put the bottle in her vagina.

Dau is \u201cthe antithesis of culture as entertainment,\u201d she explains, \u201cof having this nice, comfortable thing that you already know what it is before you go.\u201d Visitors to Dau in Paris will not be able to fully control their own experience, she says. You do not buy a ticket; you are granted a \u201cvisa\u201d. You can choose your length of stay \u2013 six hours, 24 hours or unlimited \u2013 and you must fill out a psychometric questionnaire online, the responses to which generate your own bespoke itinerary. Assuming your application is successful, you are required to trade your mobile phone for a device that directs you to various sites across the two venues. It could be a 400-seat auditorium or a fourth-level basement. I tour back-of-house spaces decorated in Dau\u2019s now-familiar Soviet/Lynchian aesthetic: dimly lit corridors, Soviet paraphernalia, more mannequins. One room is a 1940s Russian parlour; another is filled with the contents of a Berlin sex shop.</p> <p>Your device might send you to a film screening, then to a talk or a performance by a visiting artist such as Currentzis, Brian Eno, Massive Attack\u2019s Robert del Naja, or theatre director Romeo Castellucci. You might be prescribed some viewing on the Dau digital platform. And finally, you will be directed to a one-to-one session in a booth with an \u201cactive listener\u201d, who could be a real-life priest or a rabbi or a psychologist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"11c53d60c2d878ec628cdd34fd5aec27d17957d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11c53d60c2d878ec628cdd34fd5aec27d17957d4/0_309_4049_2430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nora, Dau\u2019s wife, played by the Russian actor Radmila Shchyogoleva.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nora, Dau\u2019s wife, played by the Russian actor Radmila Shchyogoleva.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phenomen IP, 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Were there aspects of the project that made D\u2019Anglejan-Chatillon uncomfortable, I ask. \u201cOf course.

It is a scene from one of the 13 features, she explains, focusing on the woman, who is by no means disempowered throughout. And it is, after all, acting, she reminds me. \u201cShe knows she can stop.

He is now back at his day job, as artistic director of Russia\u2019s Perm State Opera and Ballet Theatre. \u201cYou are in an environment that you know is a game, but it doesn\u2019t work if you are not yourself,\u201d he explains. Currentzis was invited by Khrzhanovsky to play the role of Dau after meeting him socially in Moscow, in 2005.</p> <p>He spent about a year shooting the film, then two years within the \u201cinstitute\u201d, on and off. He lived, slept and ate there, 24 hours a day, for days and weeks at a time. There was no nipping out to check emails. And when he and others did leave the institute, \u201csometimes we would notice after a while that we hadn\u2019t changed our clothes. We were sleeping and waking up and working in the clothes we had worn inside. When we were out, it was like visiting another time. The real world was like a set to us.\u201d According to Currentzis, many people lived at Dau for the duration of the experiment. \u201cI know people who, if they had to decide whether to stay there or to return to \u2018the future\u2019, they would stay.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b5c3bc7566e3c49cac3e0b1361ea23cd47771c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b5c3bc7566e3c49cac3e0b1361ea23cd47771c2/0_0_2254_1506/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dau film set\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dau was populated with \u2018participants\u2019 who lived as faithfully as possible as Soviet citizens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phenomen IP, 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Within the institute, Currentzis had some freedom to do whatever he liked, but situations were also imposed on him.

Many former Dau associates were reluctant to speak to me at all. Eddie Dick found Khrzhanovsky to be worryingly megalomaniacal and surprisingly limited in his film knowledge; he had not heard of Nicolas Roeg or seen any of his work. \u201cHis overweening arrogance was breathtaking at times. All his staff were treated like servants and everybody treated him like a prince. If he said it was raining outside, it was definitely raining.\u201d Dick helped Khrzhanovsky obtain a work permit for the UK, but when they met again in Edinburgh, Khrzhanovsky became increasingly indifferent to the proposed collaboration. \u201cWe had a falling out. Quite a deep falling out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8cc651208d0d739c61aa9dd4e6b1a9955664ba14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cc651208d0d739c61aa9dd4e6b1a9955664ba14/0_0_4288_2848/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dau film set. 1956; Alexander Migdal; Dmitry Borisovich Kaledin; Orlova; black and white; digital; events; institute; lecture/meeting; location; participants; photographer; theoretical department; type of shot/photograph; year. 87 DSC4366 1956\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u20181956.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phenomen IP, 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Questions were raised in 2011 by writer Michael Idov, who visited the Dau set and <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/movie-set-that-ate-itself-dau-ilya-khrzhanovsky\" title=\"\">wrote about it for GQ magazine</a>. He claimed a procession of young women were being offered \u201cassistant\u201d positions by Khrzhanovsky. One auditionee spoke of being questioned by him about her sex life and her willingness to perform sexual acts. When she refused, she was swiftly sent home. Further allegations surfaced this week in French newspaper Le Monde: that some of the neo-Nazi extras, led by Maxim Martsinkevich (currently serving a sentence in a penal colony for assault) repeatedly physically attacked an American artist named Andrew Ondrejcak, who was playing a psychologist on the Dau set. Ondrejcak said he was too traumatised to comment, Le Monde reported. When the Dau project began, the myth of the wild, inspired, genius-level male artist was still intact; 15 years later it emerges in a changed landscape. If the allegations about Khrzhanovsky\u2019s project were true, the #MeToo movement and expos\u00e9s of Hollywood abusers such as Harvey Weinstein would cast them in a very different light. (There is no suggestion that any of the public figures involved in the project had any knowledge of these allegations.)</p> <p>***</p> <p>I am finally granted my audience with Khrzhanovsky, late in the evening in Paris \u2013 and he is strenuous in his denials. We meet in Dau\u2019s pop-up Georgian restaurant, just across the street from the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet. He is youthful-looking, with glasses, a round face and a mop of curly black hair, shaved at the sides \u2013 a style that reminds me of Kim Jong-Un. But Khrzhanovsky is not at all despotic-seeming: he is engaged and engaging, casual and conversational. Over coffee, then whisky, and many cigarettes, in slightly broken English, he talks at length about science, art, acting, politics, and the Soviet Union.</p> <p>Lev Landau had a scientific formula for happiness, he tells me. It had four basic elements: love, work, friendship, freedom. \u201cWhat is freedom? What is happiness? That was the initial thing I was interested in.\u201d That and the nature of genius: \u201cGenius people are, for me, like kind of ancient heroes. They got a gift from the gods.\u201d That was why he cast a conductor as Dau, he explains; Currentzis has the quality of genius, which no actor can portray.</p> <p>Does Khrzhanovsky, now 43, consider himself a genius?</p> <p>\u201cNo, definitely not. I just know that I have huge intuition. But I\u2019m not clever. If I was clever, I would never make [Dau] happen, because then I would start to think, and if you think, you cannot do it.\u201d</p> <p>An only child, Khrzhanovsky grew up in Moscow surrounded by artists and intellectuals. His father, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1672007/?ref_=nv_sr_1\" title=\"\">Andrey</a>, is a renowned film-maker, whose 1968 film The Glass Harmonica became the first animated movie to be banned in the USSR. His godfather was a screenwriter named <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0947640/?ref_=nv_sr_1\" title=\"\">Sergei Yermolinsky</a>, who corresponded with Tolstoy as a child and was best friends with the writer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bulgakov\" title=\"\">Mikhail Bulgakov</a>. They were culturally, if not financially, privileged, he acknowledges. The Soviet Union broke up when he was 15, but Khrzhanovsky still considers himself a \u201cSoviet person\u201d, he says. \u201cWhen I come to the United Kingdom, at border control, where the form asks, \u2018Where were you born?\u2019 I write \u2018USSR\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e7d2a79d50829a7a0bfc4887578b7cd68413939\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e7d2a79d50829a7a0bfc4887578b7cd68413939/113_503_5766_3461/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The artist Marina Abramovi\u0107.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The artist Marina Abramovi\u0107.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phenomen IP, 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dau was less about recreating Soviet conditions than examining the present day, he explains. \u201cIf something\u2019s a fairytale, if it\u2019s fantasy or historical, then we\u2019re, in a way, relaxed because it\u2019s not about us.\u201d Soviet citizens, and Dau\u2019s participants, submitted to totalitarian rule with eyes open; today we seem to be oblivious to it, he suggests. \u201cThe system that controls us today is the cellphone. We say, \u2018Oh great, I bought the new iPhone,\u2019 or whatever. You bought something that controls you more.\u201d He picks up his own phone from the table. \u201cWhat does this thing know about us? More than we know about ourselves. We live in a transparent world, but we cannot accept it. In the same way that we cannot accept that we are on a planet moving through space when we\u2019re sitting here.\u201d</p> <p>But the retro setting was also a device to liberate human behaviour, it seems. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not real, things happen more quickly, and they\u2019re less risky, in a way. That\u2019s why you can end up in a situation where you are very emotional. In normal life you would be afraid to go that far because the cost is too high.\u201d</p> <p>He says he was never on set \u201cdirecting\u201d the action, but that he would talk to performers on the outside, or initiate events by bringing new people in. \u201cI control only the rules. If the rules were wrong, I could change the rules. But I could not break the rules,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Doesn\u2019t this suggest he was as much a dictator as a director?</p> <p>He rejects this idea, saying that a lot of behaviour could be described as dictatorial. \u201cYou can be a dictator in your family,\u201d he replies. \u201cYou can be a dictator in your company. You can be a dictator in your own life and destroy it.\u201d He rejects the idea that he manipulated his actors into extreme behaviour, though. For one thing, there was no secret filming, he points out. \u201cThe people I invited were not the type who would go on a reality show. You need to respect them. And if you respect them, then they can go very far with you.\u201d</p> <p>Khrzhanovsky also denies he abused his power for sexual gratification. I ask if he ever questioned interviewees or auditionees about their sex lives, as alleged. \u201cThis I never do when I am interviewing for the art department or the administrative positions. But for casting, I discuss childhood, parents, emotional things, love, sex, friendship, death\u2026 this is important, because we don\u2019t work with actors but with real people. You talk to them about life, not acting methods.\u201d Does he have any regrets about his treatment of women? \u201cNo. For me it makes no difference if it\u2019s a woman or man, if you\u2019re talking about work. Obviously there is an emotional difference between people and this is part of the beauty \u2013 but it is not determined by gender.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6e8c9128460e53b61ef7583c949fb53adf4649be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e8c9128460e53b61ef7583c949fb53adf4649be/0_0_5660_3740/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dau film still\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Non-actors made up the majority of the huge cast \u2013 400 principal actors and 10,000 extras, according to producers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phenomen IP, 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere are a lot of rumours around my project,\u201d he continues. \u201cThen the rumours start to look like truth, then they become the truth. But it\u2019s not the truth.\u201d Does being Russian, and having a wealthy patron, not help? He agrees, explaining that a mutual friend introduced him to Adoniev, after the oligarch said he liked Khrzhanovsky\u2019s film 4. But he has been the perfect patron, he says, giving the director plenty of money (he puts the figure at \u20ac25m) and left him well alone. \u201cFrom the moment we met to the moment shooting finished, five years, I saw him maybe five times.\u201d Khrzhanovsky insists that he does not have an unlimited budget. \u201cI remember in one of our conversations he said, \u2018You know, Ilya, probably you think I\u2019m more rich than I am.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Dau\u2019s extravagance might seem outlandish, but its budget is probably lower than that of a typical Hollywood movie. Costs in Ukraine are low, and the crew was relatively small. Added to which, Khrzhanovsky points out, he has made 13 films out of it so far, with more to come. How much more depends on what happens when the public finally gets a chance to engage with Dau. It is time to see if Khrzhanovsky\u2019s self-professed intuition was correct.</p> <p>Where can Khrzhanovsky can go next, having devoted so much of his life to this one project? Actually he has a plan, he tells me. He wants to build an experimental city of 5,000 people from around the world, where everything is recorded and everything is open and transparent. Maybe he\u2019s joking. Coming from anyone else, it would sound utterly ridiculous. With Khrzhanovsky, you can\u2019t be sure.</p> <p>\u2022 Commenting on this piece?

      "bodyText": "I first heard about Dau five years ago, and have been figuratively banging on the door ever since, to no avail. Two weeks ago, the door opened \u2013 literally. I am invited to a mansion block on London\u2019s Piccadilly where, behind an anonymous black door, lies another world. The lobby is dimly, atmospherically lit \u2013 a room out of a David Lynch movie. A man in a 1940s-style suit and hat stands pulling back the curtain and peeking on to the street \u2013 except he turns out to be a mannequin. A bald security guard with a Russian accent takes my signature and photograph. Photography and recording are forbidden. A friendly American woman guides me through labyrinthine corridors painted black and red and grey, the walls plastered with Soviet-era posters and photos. There are more mannequins in vintage costumes in startling places: hanging from a chandelier, kneeling and kissing a Soviet flag. There is a large mannequin workshop. There are modern editing suites behind frosted glass walls. There is a restaurant serving Georgian cuisine, and a function room in 1940s-style decor. The sound of a dog barking carries down the corridor. \u201cThat\u2019s a real dog, by the way,\u201d my guide says. You can\u2019t be too sure. I am here to watch some films. Dau is a film project, or at least, it began as one. Now, nobody knows how to describe it. It has been called a \u201cStalinist Truman Show\u201d, a serious anthropological experiment, even a \u201cSoviet Love Island\u201d. In scale, it has been compared to infamous movie shoots that spiralled out of control, such as Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s Apocalypse Now. But Dau also has echoes of the Stanford prison experiment \u2013 in which students lost sight of the fact that they were playing a role, acting as guards and prisoners rather too enthusiastically. Stanford\u2019s experiment had to be shut down after six days; Dau\u2019s continued for three years. Dau began in 2005 as a conventional biopic of a real-life Russian scientist named Lev Landau. Landau worked with pioneering quantum physicists such as Niels Bohr, had a hand in the Soviet atomic weapons programme, and won a Nobel prize in 1962. He took an experimental approach to sex and drugs as well as science, living by his belief that marriage should be no impediment to sexual freedom (his wife, Kora, was less enthusiastic). The film\u2019s director was Ilya Khrzhanovsky, a then 29-year-old Russian with just one previous work to his name \u2013 a challenging, hallucinatory drama titled 4, which had won considerable acclaim. The Greek-born conductor Teodor Currentzis was cast as the lead, simply named Dau. Non-actors made up the majority of the huge cast \u2013 400 principal actors and 10,000 extras. The central location of Dau was a Soviet research institute, inspired by the secret facility in which Landau lived and worked from the late 30s until his death in 1968. About a year into shooting, in 2009, a gigantic set, the size of two football pitches, was constructed at an abandoned swimming baths in Kharkiv, north-east Ukraine. But when it was completed, Khrzhanovsky abandoned the idea of finishing the film to focus exclusively on his replica institute, now also known as Dau. It became less a film set than a parallel world: a functioning mini-state, stuck in the mid-20th century and sealed off from the modern world. Dau was populated with hundreds of extras, or \u201cparticipants\u201d, who lived as faithfully as possible as Soviet citizens. The period authenticity was obsessive, covering clothes (even down to the underwear), hairstyles, food packaging, cigarette brands. What is more, time moved forwards inside Dau, from 1938 to 1968, so all the period detail was continually updated. Participants were paid in Russian roubles, which could be spent on set. (Some of the older extras, playing caretakers, smuggled in their own roubles saved from the Soviet era and tried to spend them; they were reprimanded for using \u201cfake\u201d money.) Dau\u2019s cast of non-actors was drawn from a nationwide database of auditionees compiled by the producers. The number of videotaped auditions fluctuates between 210,000 and 392,000, depending on who you ask; many of Dau\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d statistics are all but unverifiable. Roles were played by people who had played those roles for real: cleaners, waitresses, academics, party officials, shamans, artists; even, sometimes, criminals and real-life neo-Nazis, the latter of whom brought the project to a close by helping to destroy the set in \u201c1968\u201d. Scientists who visited or took up temporary residency there included Nobel-prize-winning physicist David Gross, neuroscientist James Fallon, and Harvard maths professor Shing-Tung Yau. The artists included Marina Abramovi\u0107, Carsten H\u00f6ller and theatre director Peter Sellars. The weirdest thing was, hardly any of this was actually filmed. This was not a giant Big Brother house; there were no hidden cameras. A single cinematographer \u2013 German veteran J\u00fcrgen J\u00fcrges \u2013 roamed the set with a three-person crew. Between 2009 and 2011, he filmed 700 hours of footage \u2013 only a fraction of the duration of the \u201cexperiment\u201d. The rest of the time, people apparently went about their Soviet business, unobserved. The Scottish producer Eddie Dick got a taste of Dau in 2011, when he went to Ukraine to discuss a potential collaboration between Khrzhanovsky and director Nicolas Roeg. The induction process was meticulous, he tells me. He and his colleague were given a crib sheet of facts about 1953 \u2013 the current year inside Dau. They were dressed in period costume; Dick\u2019s hair was cut; new spectacles with more period-appropriate frames were quickly ordered from a local optician. They were given \u201cpassports\u201d and some (real) roubles. On the threshold of the set, their papers were checked by guards and they were interrogated about the purpose of their visit. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if everybody started doing things when we appeared, but certainly everybody was doing what they were supposed to be doing,\u201d Dick says. Armed guards were marching up and down. People were eating in the cafe; three or four scientists were conducting experiments in the laboratory with electromagnetic guns. The journalists were preparing the newspaper of the day. The architects were poring over a plan of a Kharkiv of the future \u2013 as in, the 1960s. He even visited Dau\u2019s apartment and met his wife, Nora, played by the Russian actor Radmila Shchyogoleva. \u201cA tiny babushka opened the door. Nora floated downstairs in an elegant dress and had tea with us for half an hour. She was in character the whole time. The illusion was kept up by everyone and everything,\u201d Dick says. \u201cWe never broke the rules, either. I never turned to anyone and said, \u2018Come on. What the fuck\u2019s going on here?\u2019 You found yourself mesmerised by the facade, and we just went along with it.\u201d But throughout Dick\u2019s visit, he saw no filming taking place. Some people allegedly moved to Ukraine and lived at Dau for months, even years, eating, working and sleeping on the set. Others came and went quickly, convinced that this recreation of a totalitarian state had morphed into something genuinely oppressive and dark. Rumours began to circulate that Khrzhanovsky was as interested in sex and power as he was in art. Rather than Coppola\u2019s shoot of Apocalypse Now, Dau began to sound like the heart of darkness itself: an entire world cut off from civilisation, living by its own rules, with Khrzhanovsky as its Colonel Kurtz figure, a film-maker gone rogue. *** The reason Dau\u2019s door opened to me is that, nearly 15 years after its inception, the project is finally ready to show to the public. Three immersive exhibitions are planned for this year, in Paris, London, then Berlin. Before the opening, I am promised an interview with Khrzhanovsky in Paris. First, though, I am required to watch at least four of the 13 feature films that have been edited from 700 hours of footage from the institute. (More is planned: a TV series, documentaries, and, at some point, a cinema release for the original Dau movie.) The first three films I am shown are a trilogy centring on Nora. The films are in Russian with no subtitles, but through an earpiece a monotone voice narrates the English translation. In the first, Nora\u2019s mother comes to visit her at the institute \u2013 which looks less like a genuine Soviet facility than a postmodern fantasia based on one. In the second film, Dau (Currentzis) is visited by his former lover, a beautiful Greek woman named Maria. Nora is away, but then returns unexpectedly. The third film, set more than a decade later, is more startling. Dau has considerably aged and is almost bedridden (the real Lev Landau had a debilitating car accident in 1962; he died in 1968). His son Denis has grown up into an eccentric man-child. Nora is bored and lonely. There is incest, and prolonged scenes of graphic, unsimulated sex. In the fourth film, the institute\u2019s caretakers get drunk on vodka. An old lady vomits copiously. Then, for the bulk of the film, two men, Sasha and Valera, embark on a night of drunken passion that swings between tenderness, clumsy sex and physical and verbal abuse. The films are both exhilarating and boring. There are long, rambling dialogue scenes with very few cuts (J\u00fcrges shoots with a single camera). But there is an authentic emotional rawness and intensity to the drama. The experience is closer to watching a documentary, or perhaps a Danish Dogme film, like Lars von Trier\u2019s The Idiots. The true scale of the project becomes apparent when I am shown a 10-minute trailer for the original, still unfinished Dau movie, which looks appetisingly epic: vast crowds, 1930s street scenes, a huge replica Soviet propeller plane. There are countless striking images: a masked ball, a church bell crashing to the ground, piles of rotten cabbages, women smashing up clay rabbits on a production line. I am also shown the digital component of the project. In Paris, visitors will be able to explore hours of footage from within custom-built booths, like confession boxes. My screen is divided into a grid of 16 sub-screens, each playing a random scene, like a bank of surveillance cameras. Click on one and it becomes full-screen. Supplementary information is available on each character in any scene: biographies, photo galleries, documentation such as passports and letters. Scanning this brings up a bewildering panoply of images: Abramovi\u0107 (in 50s costume) undergoing a purification ritual by a shaman; Fallon discussing capitalism at a dinner party; Dau standing over a naked man and woman having sex (there is always at least one screen playing sexual content). An official abusing a tearful, naked woman in a prison cell; shockingly, he forces her to drink cognac, then to put the bottle in her vagina. Nothing looks simulated. I recognise people from the movies I have seen: a bearded scientist who insulted Dau\u2019s son as \u201cclinically retarded\u201d is now discussing a recent ayahuasca experiment. Elsewhere, one of the waitresses from the institute\u2019s cafe is standing on a table with two men in their underpants at a party. They all begin throwing knives at an abstract painting. \u201cThat\u2019s what I call contemporary art!\u201d one of them exclaims. \u201cNow we can put this up in a gallery.\u201d *** Dau\u2019s Paris launch took place this week in the half-renovated spaces of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet and Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ville. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely, 100% sure that what we\u2019re experiencing here will be in the history books of Paris, of art history, of scientific innovation, of cinema history,\u201d says Ruth Mackenzie, artistic director of Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet. The former director of the London 2012 Olympics cultural programme, Mackenzie has seen some grand cultural spectacles in her time, but describes Dau as a once-in-a-generation \u201cgamechanger\u201d. Others are more sceptical. \u201cI\u2019m convinced the reason the project has been active for so long has nothing to do with creative reasons, but that it allows Khrzhanovsky to live a luxurious and tyrannical lifestyle, lording it over dozens, if not hundreds, of people on a Russian oligarch\u2019s dime,\u201d says one critic, who asked not to be named. The \u201coligarch\u201d is no secret: he is a Russian entrepreneur named Sergei Adoniev, who became a Bulgarian citizen in 2008. One estimate puts his wealth at $800m, mostly made in the Russian telecommunications business. He also funds Russia\u2019s opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta, and largely devotes his time and wealth to cultural and philanthropic causes. But this week Bulgaria rescinded Adoniev\u2019s citizenship; a ministry of justice spokeswoman said this followed notification that he \u201chad been convicted in the United States 20 years ago on fraud charges\u201d. When I visit Paris ahead of the launch, I meet Martine d\u2019Anglejan-Chatillon, who Khrzhanovsky \u201ccast\u201d in the role of Dau\u2019s executive producer\u201d in 2016. Dau is \u201cthe antithesis of culture as entertainment,\u201d she explains, \u201cof having this nice, comfortable thing that you already know what it is before you go.\u201d Visitors to Dau in Paris will not be able to fully control their own experience, she says. You do not buy a ticket; you are granted a \u201cvisa\u201d. You can choose your length of stay \u2013 six hours, 24 hours or unlimited \u2013 and you must fill out a psychometric questionnaire online, the responses to which generate your own bespoke itinerary. Assuming your application is successful, you are required to trade your mobile phone for a device that directs you to various sites across the two venues. It could be a 400-seat auditorium or a fourth-level basement. I tour back-of-house spaces decorated in Dau\u2019s now-familiar Soviet/Lynchian aesthetic: dimly lit corridors, Soviet paraphernalia, more mannequins. One room is a 1940s Russian parlour; another is filled with the contents of a Berlin sex shop. Your device might send you to a film screening, then to a talk or a performance by a visiting artist such as Currentzis, Brian Eno, Massive Attack\u2019s Robert del Naja, or theatre director Romeo Castellucci. You might be prescribed some viewing on the Dau digital platform. And finally, you will be directed to a one-to-one session in a booth with an \u201cactive listener\u201d, who could be a real-life priest or a rabbi or a psychologist. Were there aspects of the project that made D\u2019Anglejan-Chatillon uncomfortable, I ask. \u201cOf course. One projects. In the ambiguities that Ilya creates, we project our fears, our anxieties, our egos. I think that\u2019s part of the work: it activates whatever part of you is a little bit damaged or heightened.\u201d She puts the question back to me. I mention the scene with the actor playing a prison guard abusing the naked woman. It is a scene from one of the 13 features, she explains, focusing on the woman, who is by no means disempowered throughout. And it is, after all, acting, she reminds me. \u201cShe knows she can stop. Everyone would stop if she said, \u2018I can\u2019t handle this.\u2019 But she has chosen to put herself almost through this\u2026 almost this fire. Probably to find something else on the other side.\u201d Without speaking to the woman herself, it is hard to verify this. The casting sheds some light on how Dau\u2019s realism was achieved. Dau\u2019s man-child son is played by Nikolay Voronov, who turns out to be a Ukrainian YouTube star. Sasha and Valera, the two gay lovers, were formerly homeless people, someone tells me, and, \u201cThey do that every night.\u201d Nora\u2019s mother is played by Radmila Shchyogoleva\u2019s real-life mother, Lidiya. I speak to Dau\u2019s star, Teodor Currentzis, over the phone. \u201cThe point is how to be yourself and not to be yourself at the same moment,\u201d he says. He is now back at his day job, as artistic director of Russia\u2019s Perm State Opera and Ballet Theatre. \u201cYou are in an environment that you know is a game, but it doesn\u2019t work if you are not yourself,\u201d he explains. Currentzis was invited by Khrzhanovsky to play the role of Dau after meeting him socially in Moscow, in 2005. He spent about a year shooting the film, then two years within the \u201cinstitute\u201d, on and off. He lived, slept and ate there, 24 hours a day, for days and weeks at a time. There was no nipping out to check emails. And when he and others did leave the institute, \u201csometimes we would notice after a while that we hadn\u2019t changed our clothes. We were sleeping and waking up and working in the clothes we had worn inside. When we were out, it was like visiting another time. The real world was like a set to us.\u201d According to Currentzis, many people lived at Dau for the duration of the experiment. \u201cI know people who, if they had to decide whether to stay there or to return to \u2018the future\u2019, they would stay.\u201d Within the institute, Currentzis had some freedom to do whatever he liked, but situations were also imposed on him. Somebody would knock at the door of his apartment, for example, or Nora\u2019s mother would arrive. Sometimes he discussed events with Khrzhanovsky; sometimes Khrzhanovsky would not speak to him at all. The experience was no holiday. \u201cI had absolute freedom inside, but if the \u2018KGB\u2019 grabbed me, they could send me to jail. They could behave really badly to you. I felt very uncomfortable many times, but it\u2019s the same discomfort I feel in my own life. If we want to make something that is real, it has to be like real life.\u201d Other people I spoke to were less comfortable with Khrzhanovsky\u2019s project. Many former Dau associates were reluctant to speak to me at all. Eddie Dick found Khrzhanovsky to be worryingly megalomaniacal and surprisingly limited in his film knowledge; he had not heard of Nicolas Roeg or seen any of his work. \u201cHis overweening arrogance was breathtaking at times. All his staff were treated like servants and everybody treated him like a prince. If he said it was raining outside, it was definitely raining.\u201d Dick helped Khrzhanovsky obtain a work permit for the UK, but when they met again in Edinburgh, Khrzhanovsky became increasingly indifferent to the proposed collaboration. \u201cWe had a falling out. Quite a deep falling out.\u201d Questions were raised in 2011 by writer Michael Idov, who visited the Dau set and wrote about it for GQ magazine. He claimed a procession of young women were being offered \u201cassistant\u201d positions by Khrzhanovsky. One auditionee spoke of being questioned by him about her sex life and her willingness to perform sexual acts. When she refused, she was swiftly sent home. Further allegations surfaced this week in French newspaper Le Monde: that some of the neo-Nazi extras, led by Maxim Martsinkevich (currently serving a sentence in a penal colony for assault) repeatedly physically attacked an American artist named Andrew Ondrejcak, who was playing a psychologist on the Dau set. Ondrejcak said he was too traumatised to comment, Le Monde reported. When the Dau project began, the myth of the wild, inspired, genius-level male artist was still intact; 15 years later it emerges in a changed landscape. If the allegations about Khrzhanovsky\u2019s project were true, the #MeToo movement and expos\u00e9s of Hollywood abusers such as Harvey Weinstein would cast them in a very different light. (There is no suggestion that any of the public figures involved in the project had any knowledge of these allegations.) *** I am finally granted my audience with Khrzhanovsky, late in the evening in Paris \u2013 and he is strenuous in his denials. We meet in Dau\u2019s pop-up Georgian restaurant, just across the street from the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet. He is youthful-looking, with glasses, a round face and a mop of curly black hair, shaved at the sides \u2013 a style that reminds me of Kim Jong-Un. But Khrzhanovsky is not at all despotic-seeming: he is engaged and engaging, casual and conversational. Over coffee, then whisky, and many cigarettes, in slightly broken English, he talks at length about science, art, acting, politics, and the Soviet Union. Lev Landau had a scientific formula for happiness, he tells me. It had four basic elements: love, work, friendship, freedom. \u201cWhat is freedom? What is happiness? That was the initial thing I was interested in.\u201d That and the nature of genius: \u201cGenius people are, for me, like kind of ancient heroes. They got a gift from the gods.\u201d That was why he cast a conductor as Dau, he explains; Currentzis has the quality of genius, which no actor can portray. Does Khrzhanovsky, now 43, consider himself a genius? \u201cNo, definitely not. I just know that I have huge intuition. But I\u2019m not clever. If I was clever, I would never make [Dau] happen, because then I would start to think, and if you think, you cannot do it.\u201d An only child, Khrzhanovsky grew up in Moscow surrounded by artists and intellectuals. His father, Andrey, is a renowned film-maker, whose 1968 film The Glass Harmonica became the first animated movie to be banned in the USSR. His godfather was a screenwriter named Sergei Yermolinsky, who corresponded with Tolstoy as a child and was best friends with the writer Mikhail Bulgakov. They were culturally, if not financially, privileged, he acknowledges. The Soviet Union broke up when he was 15, but Khrzhanovsky still considers himself a \u201cSoviet person\u201d, he says. \u201cWhen I come to the United Kingdom, at border control, where the form asks, \u2018Where were you born?\u2019 I write \u2018USSR\u2019.\u201d Dau was less about recreating Soviet conditions than examining the present day, he explains. \u201cIf something\u2019s a fairytale, if it\u2019s fantasy or historical, then we\u2019re, in a way, relaxed because it\u2019s not about us.\u201d Soviet citizens, and Dau\u2019s participants, submitted to totalitarian rule with eyes open; today we seem to be oblivious to it, he suggests. \u201cThe system that controls us today is the cellphone. We say, \u2018Oh great, I bought the new iPhone,\u2019 or whatever. You bought something that controls you more.\u201d He picks up his own phone from the table. \u201cWhat does this thing know about us? More than we know about ourselves. We live in a transparent world, but we cannot accept it. In the same way that we cannot accept that we are on a planet moving through space when we\u2019re sitting here.\u201d But the retro setting was also a device to liberate human behaviour, it seems. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not real, things happen more quickly, and they\u2019re less risky, in a way. That\u2019s why you can end up in a situation where you are very emotional. In normal life you would be afraid to go that far because the cost is too high.\u201d He says he was never on set \u201cdirecting\u201d the action, but that he would talk to performers on the outside, or initiate events by bringing new people in. \u201cI control only the rules. If the rules were wrong, I could change the rules. But I could not break the rules,\u201d he says. Doesn\u2019t this suggest he was as much a dictator as a director? He rejects this idea, saying that a lot of behaviour could be described as dictatorial. \u201cYou can be a dictator in your family,\u201d he replies. \u201cYou can be a dictator in your company. You can be a dictator in your own life and destroy it.\u201d He rejects the idea that he manipulated his actors into extreme behaviour, though. For one thing, there was no secret filming, he points out. \u201cThe people I invited were not the type who would go on a reality show. You need to respect them. And if you respect them, then they can go very far with you.\u201d Khrzhanovsky also denies he abused his power for sexual gratification. I ask if he ever questioned interviewees or auditionees about their sex lives, as alleged. \u201cThis I never do when I am interviewing for the art department or the administrative positions. But for casting, I discuss childhood, parents, emotional things, love, sex, friendship, death\u2026 this is important, because we don\u2019t work with actors but with real people. You talk to them about life, not acting methods.\u201d Does he have any regrets about his treatment of women? \u201cNo. For me it makes no difference if it\u2019s a woman or man, if you\u2019re talking about work. Obviously there is an emotional difference between people and this is part of the beauty \u2013 but it is not determined by gender.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of rumours around my project,\u201d he continues. \u201cThen the rumours start to look like truth, then they become the truth. But it\u2019s not the truth.\u201d Does being Russian, and having a wealthy patron, not help? He agrees, explaining that a mutual friend introduced him to Adoniev, after the oligarch said he liked Khrzhanovsky\u2019s film 4. But he has been the perfect patron, he says, giving the director plenty of money (he puts the figure at \u20ac25m) and left him well alone. \u201cFrom the moment we met to the moment shooting finished, five years, I saw him maybe five times.\u201d Khrzhanovsky insists that he does not have an unlimited budget. \u201cI remember in one of our conversations he said, \u2018You know, Ilya, probably you think I\u2019m more rich than I am.\u2019\u201d Dau\u2019s extravagance might seem outlandish, but its budget is probably lower than that of a typical Hollywood movie. Costs in Ukraine are low, and the crew was relatively small. Added to which, Khrzhanovsky points out, he has made 13 films out of it so far, with more to come. How much more depends on what happens when the public finally gets a chance to engage with Dau. It is time to see if Khrzhanovsky\u2019s self-professed intuition was correct. Where can Khrzhanovsky can go next, having devoted so much of his life to this one project? Actually he has a plan, he tells me. He wants to build an experimental city of 5,000 people from around the world, where everything is recorded and everything is open and transparent. Maybe he\u2019s joking. Coming from anyone else, it would sound utterly ridiculous. With Khrzhanovsky, you can\u2019t be sure. \u2022 Commenting on this piece?

      "bodyText": "This week, the Trump administration pushed ahead with its plan to return asylum seekers to Mexico while their cases are considered, moving the first group through San Diego\u2019s San Ysidro crossing late on Friday. Meanwhile, far to the south, thousands of Central Americans are waiting at Mexico\u2019s southern frontier for humanitarian visas. Several hundred have already hopped the border, and are following the route of previous migrant caravans north towards Tijuana. What neither group may be aware of, however, is that the city they are heading for is \u2013 once again \u2013 Mexico\u2019s murder capital. Last year the country broke its own homicide record, with prosecutors opening 28,816 murder cases, 15% more than the previous year. And the city with most killings was Tijuana. Three murders on New Year\u2019s Eve took the total to 2,502 \u2013 a rate of 126 per 100,000 inhabitants, returning the city to levels of hyper-violence it last saw a decade ago. And the numbers are still climbing: on 17 January, police announced 127 murders to date this year. Early that same evening, three more men were gunned down on streets across town in plain view; 24 hours later another three people were killed, including two women. While external observers fear a return to cartel turf wars over smuggling routes into the US, the city\u2019s district attorney, Jos\u00e9 Alberto \u00c1lavarez Mendoza, highlights a pandemic of petty drug dealing on the local market, as neighbourhood gangs fight block-by-block for \u2018tienditas\u2019, outlets for mainly synthetic drugs. Tijuana\u2019s leading expert on narco-traffic, Victor Clark Alfaro, says: \u201cThe cartel leaders \u2013 now the kind of people you\u2019d meet at the country-club \u2013 have lost control of the low-level street dealers.\u201d The violence is the worst since Tijuana witnessed all-out war between the local Arellano F\u00e9lix syndicate and the Sinaloa cartel of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, who is currently on trial in New York. Broadly speaking, Guzm\u00e1n won. \u201cThose years were also characterised by extortion and kidnapping, which affected every citizen,\u201d says \u00c1lvarez. \u201cBut these are now down. What we have is a tragic level of homicide largely among petty dealers in the domestic market for methamphetamine. \u201cThe drugs going north are getting through, but smuggling into the US is not violent right now \u2013 the killing is local, more intimate.\u201d \u00c1lvarez says \u201cthese homicides are often people that know each other. They stake out turf, then defend or expand it. These are not cartels, they are splinters, cells.\u201d The method of killing leaves hardly any evidence, he says. \u201cI have a body, but no gun, no bullet or witness prepared to come forward. The revenge of the friends or family of the victim is not through the law, but another killing on the street. Sometimes I don\u2019t even have an ID \u2013 30% of our victims are buried anonymously in the common cemetery.\u201d Victor Clark Alfaro has monitored crime and narco-traffic in Tijuana since the 1980s, for his Binational Commission for Human Rights here, and as a professor at San Diego State University across the border. Yet again, he is this week preparing a file as expert witness in a drugs trial in California. The cartels are still forceful in Tijuana, he says. But whereas up to 10 years ago, the \u2018narco-juniors\u2019 of the Arellano F\u00e9lix clan would flash their wealth around discos and restaurants, \u201ctheir heirs are invisible. They are businessmen, the people you\u2019d meet at the country club. For the first time in three decades, I cannot name their leaders to you.\u201d The Sinaloa cartel is still around, he says. And the defeated Arellano F\u00e9lix Tijuana cartel has been revived, led by the original brothers\u2019 sister, Enedina Arellano F\u00e9lix, her children, nephews and nieces, reformed as the Tijuana Cartel Nueva Generaci\u00f3n \u2013 and supported by the rising power in the Mexican organised crime world, the Jalisco New Generation cartel. \u201cBut the old cartels are fragmenting inside themselves,\u201d says Clark, \u201cacross Mexico, and here. They still smuggle cocaine and meth \u2013 though now we\u2019re seeing more fentanyl \u2013 and big meth producers are still selling on the domestic market. Six months ago, a meth lab was raided in Tecate capable of producing $10m-worth of meth a day.\u201d But while the Arellano F\u00e9lix clan carefully nurtured and controlled the domestic market, he says, the new generation doesn\u2019t need to. \u201cThey do business, sell to the middleman for profit, but are separate from the killing between people who are usually on drugs themselves \u2013 where the drug dens are, in the poorest barrios where maquiladora [assembly plant] workers live, and hundreds live on the street.\u201d He adds: \u201cWhy should they care? They know that every time 10 people are killed on the street, 1o more will take their place. What matters to them is the money.\u201d Clark insists, however, that \u201cwe have always to factor in the role of the police \u2013 either dealing the drugs themselves, or allowing it to happen.

For most of us, trauma describes an experience that takes place in our private lives: unexpectedly losing a loved one, or being in a situation in which our sense of survival is on the line, such as fleeing a country, or sexual intrusion, or being booted out of a relationship without warning. Unless we have lived in war zones or under dictatorships, we don\u2019t tend to think of daily political life as so damaging. Yet reactions to Brexit suggest that it is being experienced by many as a trauma, with intrusive and repetitive thoughts emerging from a severely disruptive or damaging situation. Disbelief, fear and the wish for it all to be a bad dream are common features of trauma.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We want it to go away and yet we are obsessed by it.

Talking with friends and colleagues in Donald Trump\u2019s America, there is a similar repetitive theme of outrage, disbelief and indigestibility.</p> <p>For us in the UK it feels as if no one was minding the shop. The political parents have abdicated. Attachment theory, which originated in the work of John Bowlby, has shown the importance of secure parental foundations and presence in forming stable ongoing identities. Insecure, anxious and avoidant attachments can lead to isolation or cleaving to relationships that mimic the insecurities experienced in early life. With the country\u2019s identity ruptured, people of all political persuasions find solace in forms of solidarity that amplify a sense of being beleaguered while simultaneously proffering hope. </p> <p>The Brexit fracture and the belligerence associated with it has marked our society in disturbing ways. Public space is as inflamed as private space is in a divorce. There are lies. Many lies. Lying is not just a moral category, it has psychological import. It divides us from aspects of ourselves. To maintain a lie, we have to scaffold it, to separate it off from doubt and questions. Then we become defensive and more insistent, as though by being more forceful, the deceit will hold us within it. What is on the other side of the lie becomes unreachable. Complexity and understanding are suppressed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fda3cd9db30502eb637276f1ecd07951a2aac82e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fda3cd9db30502eb637276f1ecd07951a2aac82e/0_0_2465_1478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A divided house \u2026 Theresa May during PMQs in Westminster.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A divided house \u2026 Theresa May during PMQs in Westminster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Parliamentary Recording Unit Handout/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We are all capable of this fundamentalist form of thought when we are cornered.

The memoir is a story about my childhood misadventures after being orphaned to cancer, aged nine.

My older siblings, and any adults who knew the dead parents I sought to conjure in my mind, had \u201cbetter\u201d memories than me. They corrected me when I said I remembered this or that. No, Father wasn\u2019t left-handed. No, that\u2019s not what our cat was called. No, Mother didn\u2019t call lavatories \u201cloos\u201d.

For me, not having certain memories, or not remembering \u201cas well\u201d as my siblings, was humiliating. The fact that, secretly, I couldn\u2019t remember much about my father, bar him making me toffee for breakfast in a frying pan (an unreliable memory, if ever there was one) and him sitting me on his knee as he did up the buckles of my patent Mary Jane party shoes, made me think I did not really ever have a father.

Flawed, pockmarked, crusted in layers of transmogrified facts and fictions, memory when looked in the face is like an Elizabethan courtier plastered with a mask of white lead, revealing the cracks for the first time. Its power falls away. Now I think, It\u2019s OK, I forgot something \u2013 the scale of a childhood house, the age of my aged father when he had me.

Can Effie and her campaign team mobilise a groundswell of support? Wood\u2019s deft, hilarious writing explores big themes \u2013 fairness, feminism and refusing to accept a dispiriting status quo \u2013 while Mirelle Ortega\u2019s cheery illustrations do full justice to Effie\u2019s luxuriant locks.</p> <p>An evocative debut novel from Jasbinder Bilan, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/asha-the-spirit-bird-9781911490197.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><strong>Asha and the Spirit Bird</strong></a><strong> </strong>(Chicken House), weaves ancient Hindu beliefs into a fast-paced quest across modern-day India, from the foothills of the Himalayas to the bustle of the big city. Asha\u2019s father, Paras, is away working in Zandapur \u2013 but now his letters have stopped coming, and her mother is dangerously in debt. Spurred on by the village fortune teller, Asha and her best friend, Jeevan, set out to find Paras, helped along by a great bird that just might be the spirit of Asha\u2019s grandmother.

He doesn\u2019t think much of the detective assigned to his mother\u2019s case; in fact, he is starting to believe that the Whispers \u2013 legendary creatures who grant wishes<strong> </strong>\u2013 may have hidden her in the forest.

He also has a lot to contend with: disapproving teachers, gossiping peers and an alarming stalker, who deplores his glammed-up swagger, and wants to control his sexuality and appearance. Part thriller, part down-to-earth guide, this is humane, sex-positive writing of the funniest, filthiest and most heartening kind.</p> <p>Lisa Williamson, author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/jul/08/the-art-of-being-normal-lisa-williamson-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Art of Being Normal</em></a>, returns with <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/paper-avalanche.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><strong>Paper Avalanche</strong></a> (David Fickling).

      "bodyText": "January brings a burst of exhilarating new fiction for readers of eight-plus. Laura Wood\u2019s Vote for Effie (Scholastic) features an exuberant protagonist: huge-haired, stationery-obsessed Euphemia \u201cEffie\u201d Kostas gets off to a shaky start at her new school by antagonising popular junior council president Aaron Davis \u2013 then decides to run against him. Can Effie and her campaign team mobilise a groundswell of support? Wood\u2019s deft, hilarious writing explores big themes \u2013 fairness, feminism and refusing to accept a dispiriting status quo \u2013 while Mirelle Ortega\u2019s cheery illustrations do full justice to Effie\u2019s luxuriant locks. An evocative debut novel from Jasbinder Bilan, Asha and the Spirit Bird (Chicken House), weaves ancient Hindu beliefs into a fast-paced quest across modern-day India, from the foothills of the Himalayas to the bustle of the big city. Asha\u2019s father, Paras, is away working in Zandapur \u2013 but now his letters have stopped coming, and her mother is dangerously in debt. Spurred on by the village fortune teller, Asha and her best friend, Jeevan, set out to find Paras, helped along by a great bird that just might be the spirit of Asha\u2019s grandmother. Satisfyingly classic in feel, Bilan\u2019s story also highlights contemporary issues, such as child labour and the perils of factory fires. Also from Chicken House, Lucy Strange follows up last year\u2019s The Secret of Nightingale Wood with a thrilling second world war story about belonging and betrayal, Our Castle by the Sea. Eleven-year-old Pet lives in a lighthouse, raised on eerie local tales such as the Daughters of Stone \u2013 stories full of wild waters, danger and sacrifice. As war breaks out, however, Pet, her sister Magda and their German mother become the targets of gossip and spite. When Mutti is taken away, and accusations of stolen secrets run rife, who can Pet trust? From the US comes The Whispers by Greg Howard (Puffin), a heartbreaking, beguiling debut set in small-town South Carolina. Eleven-year-old Riley is sassy and smart with a missing mother and a crush on Dylan, his \u201cpersonal redneck superhero\u201d. He doesn\u2019t think much of the detective assigned to his mother\u2019s case; in fact, he is starting to believe that the Whispers \u2013 legendary creatures who grant wishes \u2013 may have hidden her in the forest. But what will he have to give up to discover the truth? This poignant journey through the badlands of grief is crammed with tenderness, wit and warmth. For teenagers, from Penguin, the whip-smart Jack of Hearts (and Other Parts) by LC Rosen follows 17-year-old Jack Rothman, who is out, proud and cheerfully explicit about sex in his new online advice column. He also has a lot to contend with: disapproving teachers, gossiping peers and an alarming stalker, who deplores his glammed-up swagger, and wants to control his sexuality and appearance. Part thriller, part down-to-earth guide, this is humane, sex-positive writing of the funniest, filthiest and most heartening kind. Lisa Williamson, author of The Art of Being Normal, returns with Paper Avalanche (David Fickling). Friendship and romance are too risky for Ro; no one must find out where she lives, in the squalid house her mother, Bonnie, has filled with strange purchases and hoarded paper. Can Ro resist Tanvi, whose determination to befriend her seems unstoppable? And could Ro\u2019s talent for singing offer a way out of Bonnie\u2019s suffocating maze? This pacy, instantly absorbing book evokes the fear and anger of being trapped or let down by parental obsession. Anthony McGowan brings his four-book series about brothers Nicky and Kenny, their visceral love of the natural world and the bleak fondness of their family life, to a painful though uplifting conclusion in Lark (Barrington Stoke). The moment at which Nicky, injured on a snow-bound Yorkshire moor during an ill-fated winter hike, hears the \u201cmad, ecstatic music\u201d of a lark\u2019s song is especially transporting. For five- to eight-year-olds, meanwhile, from multitalented molecular biologist and graphic designer Sabina Radeva comes an entrancing picture\u2011book retelling of Darwin\u2019s On the Origin of Species (Puffin). It is filled with informative, beautifully designed diagrams and maps (as well as charming family portraits of Mr and Mrs Darwin, their eight children, and their dog). Salient quotations from the original book accompany clear, careful explanations of key concepts; the appendix cogently addresses misconceptions, as well as areas in which Darwin\u2019s hypotheses have been outstripped by new scientific knowledge. The Sea Book (DK) by Charlotte Milner also stands out, amid shoals of ocean-focused fact books, for its friendly and appealing design; it has clearly been made not for the coffee table but for children to use and enjoy. From the role the sea plays in sustaining human life, to details of exotic animals such as the cookiecutter shark and by-the-wind sailor, it is rich, engrossing, and packed with passion \u2013 especially when calling to preserve the seas from plastic pollution. In a different vein, there is a deceptively simple little book from Eva Eland, When Sadness Comes to Call (Andersen). This contemplative, soft-textured story features Sadness as a sweet, see-through turquoise blob who visits an initially alarmed, overwhelmed child. If Sadness should show up at your door, Eland suggests, accepting, naming and welcoming it rather than hiding from the feeling, may help send it gently on its way. Among picture books for younger readers, David LaRochelle\u2019s playfully titled Isle of You (Walker) is imbued with a dreamlike richness and features warm pastel illustrations by Jaime Kim. After a sad or angry day, children are invited to take ship for their own beautiful refuge, casting their worries aside on a voyage to an island where eagle-back flights and roller-skating polar bears await. This is a lovely, soothing antidote to daily snappishness and stress. From Two Hoots, and the fabulous author-illustrator Morag Hood, there\u2019s the adorable aardvark story of Aalfred and Aalbert, whose different sleep cycles have doomed them never to meet, much to the frustration of a small avian matchmaker. Whether snoozing curled up in their burrows or following their passions of broccoli, cheese and flowers, these aardvarks, and their happy ending, make for ear\u2011to\u2011ear smiles. Lastly, in Linda Sunderland\u2019s The Kiss (Little Tiger), featuring Jessica Courtney-Tickle\u2019s luminous illustrations, the kiss Edwyn blows his grandma becomes a treasure she keeps in her pocket. It generates more warmth and light wherever she goes \u2013 until a rich man tries to buy it from her. This sumptuous fairytale, filled with everyday magic, is a testament to the great power of the smallest loving gestures.",

      "body": "<p>George Clarke asked his father not to text him when he went on holiday to Valencia in September 2015; he didn\u2019t want his father to be charged the extra fees. When Clarke, 25, landed back in the UK a week later, he headed straight to the restaurant where he worked as a waiter. His boss told him that one of his father\u2019s neighbours had called while he was away \u2013 she was concerned about his father. Clarke had had messages like this before, and figuring his father was on one of his regular drinking binges, ignored her message. But two weeks later, the same neighbour called again. Clarke drove to his father\u2019s flat, two miles from where he lived in Holmfirth, Yorkshire. No lights were on, and no one answered. He looked through a window and saw a loaf of bread on the kitchen counter that had turned blue and was surrounded by flies. He called the police.</p> <p>\u201cThe next thing I knew, there was this big, 6ft 8in man covered in tattoos outside the flat with one of those battering rams they use in drug raids, trying to smash the door down,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cI had a chuckle to myself, as the whole moment was quite slapstick, and my dad would have laughed, watching these officers trying to knock his old wooden door down.\u201d Once inside, the police found Clarke\u2019s father upstairs. A postmortem later revealed he had been dead for three weeks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I remember a time Dad drove us to school, and, looking back, I realise he was absolutely out of it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Clarke has been grappling with that day since. \u201cI get a heaviness in my chest when I talk about this,\u201d he says. His parents divorced when he was 13; as a teenager, Clarke would visit his father two or three times a week with his two younger brothers, and spend the rest of his time with his mother. He remembers a time his father drove them to school, when Clarke was 15. \u201cLooking back, I realise he was absolutely out of it. He was in a jovial mood, singing at the top of his lungs. And as a child I didn\u2019t realise it was abnormal. The smell of alcohol was normal to me. It became part of the fabric of my childhood.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke would find bottles of alcohol hidden around the house; in the cereal cupboard, or the washing basket. He became estranged from his father when he stopped coming to his rugby matches, and missed his graduation from Newcastle University. \u201cEveryone was there with their family. And I bought him a ticket and offered him a drive up, and he said he\u2019d come, and then he went silent for a week,\u201d he says. His father\u2019s behaviour has affected his relationships. \u201cYou put your faith in someone,\u201d he says, \u201cbut if you\u2019re not sure that faith is 100% well placed, you get hurt over and over again. There\u2019s a cynic in me that thinks, well my dad lied to me, so why shouldn\u2019t someone else?\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Many children of alcoholics now have a dead parent, whether or not alcoholism is explicitly referenced on the death certificate. Alcoholism has long been recognised as a deadly disease, but there is far less awareness of its hidden victims: the children of alcoholics. <a href=\"https://www.thestar.co.uk/news/more-than-200-000-children-live-with-alcohol-dependent-parents-1-8476235/amp\">A 2017 study by the University of Sheffield</a> found that more than 200,000 children across England live with an alcoholic parent; <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11553503\">other research</a> has put the number of people in the UK affected by a parent\u2019s problem drinking at 2.6 million.</p> <p>I grew up in a home affected by alcoholism. My father, whom I never knew, suffered from alcoholism all his life. My parents divorced by the time I was six, and my mother raised me and my seven siblings alone. But she also battled with depression and alcoholism, and it swallowed much of the joy from her life. She died when I was 16.</p> <p>Like many children of alcoholics, I tried to reason with my mother in an effort to stop her drinking. But when you\u2019re 13, the last thing you want to be doing is begging a parent to stop hiding bottles of wine down the side of the bed, or spending your time persuading them that their life is, in fact, worth living.</p> <p>Children grow used to an alcoholic\u2019s many contradictions. My mother was a fiercely intelligent, empathetic person, who went from nursing in a mental hospital to completing a politics degree at the age of 40. I would love to inherit her good qualities, but I also don\u2019t want to end up like the person she was at her weakest; when she had truly fallen victim to alcohol.</p> <p>Children who were raised by an alcoholic parent share a bond; we are part of a club we never signed up to. My older sister thought that if people knew about our parents\u2019 illness, our family would appear broken or dysfunctional. This went for me and some of my other siblings, too. For decades, we hid the true extent of our childhood experiences from others, because we just wanted to be \u201cnormal\u201d.</p> <p>Instead we have tried to live the best lives we can as adults, and supported each other. I am the third youngest, and my older siblings bore the brunt of my mother\u2019s illness, shielding the rest of us. While he was at university, my older brother spoke to my mother on the phone every night and tried to talk her out of a depressive spiral. When she died, my older sister Mary, who was 22 at the time, became legal guardian to me, my younger sister and brother, who were 13 and 15. We might otherwise have been separated and put into care.</p> <p>Today, some of my siblings drink, and some of them don\u2019t. I enjoy social drinking. Since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/12/children-alcoholic-parents-services-cut\">children of alcoholics are far more likely to become alcoholics themselves</a>, I sometimes wonder how much our parents\u2019 illnesses were hereditary, and whether we\u2019re ever fully in control. While I\u2019m confident I won\u2019t develop a problem with alcohol, I have a solid support system around me, of good friends and family. But I\u2019m not so sure things would have turned out this way without them.</p> <p>Over the past year, there has been an increased focus on helping children of alcoholics. In April last year, the Department of Health and Social Care, and the Department for Work and Pensions, jointly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/23/government-offers-help-children-alcoholic-parents\">announced \u00a36m of funding</a>. The plans include fast access to children\u2019s mental health services, and programmes to treat parents\u2019 addiction. The funding will also speed up the identification of children who are at risk, in the hope of reducing the numbers being taken into care. Stigma and shame have prevented many children from talking about the repercussions on their own health and wellbeing, but <a href=\"http://www.nacoa.org.uk/young-people/information.html\">according to the National Association for Children of Alcoholics (NACOA)</a>, psychiatric problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and bulimia are common.</p> <p>I wanted to speak to others who grew up like me; to hear their stories, their coping mechanisms, and understand how they got through it.</p> <p>***</p> <p>As one of the few people of colour in a very white area of Sunderland, Bindy Galsinh tells me she often felt isolated, forced to grapple with her father\u2019s alcoholism alone. \u201cIt felt like my brothers and I were the only brown people in the north-east of England at the time. And there was massive stigma in our [Sikh] community. All of my aunts and uncles knew about his problem, because when they\u2019d visit us they\u2019d see him drunk. But all of my family, even my grandmas, would act like: \u2018That\u2019s the way it is, keep it hush-hush.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04a5c1f702e074d9450f57ef51c420f32042fcc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04a5c1f702e074d9450f57ef51c420f32042fcc3/116_968_3734_4665/800.jpg\" alt=\"George Clarke\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Clarke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Spring/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Galsinh\u2019s father was drunk, he was aggressive and unpredictable. \u201cHe\u2019d stay up and watch television all night. I remember when I was 10, I woke up to go to the toilet and was so scared of making any noise in the bathroom that I grabbed a pint glass, weed in it, and poured it down the sink.\u201d</p> <p>Galsinh was diagnosed with PTSD in her 20s. She suffers from flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety and depression. She compares growing up with an alcoholic parent to living in \u201ca war zone\u201d, because you never know what is coming. \u201cWe don\u2019t develop like other people. We didn\u2019t grow up with safety around us.\u201d She feared being defined by her father\u2019s alcoholism in the eyes of friends or family. \u201cIt\u2019s the look that says, \u2018There must be something wrong with you, because he wouldn\u2019t drink this much.\u2019 It\u2019s worse than shame.\u201d</p> <p>Today, if Galsinh goes out, she has a drink. She chose not to be teetotal because she wants to prove she has control over alcohol, and does so with the support of friends. \u201cTo some weird degree, I drink because I want to feel closer to what he went through. I need to understand. You want to feel power over it.\u201d</p> <p>Galsinh\u2019s father died in 2013. She says she feels guilty for not grieving for him. \u201cI was grieving for myself. That I could have been more if I had the support. I was grieving for the fact I didn\u2019t deserve any of that.\u201d She has few happy memories of her father, she says, although, \u201cHe was the cleverest person I\u2019ve ever met. If anything was broken he could fix it.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>My earliest memories of alcoholism being discussed in public life are in relation to the Liberal Democrat leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/charleskennedy\">Charles Kennedy</a>. To me, he seemed a committed politician, and as a 13-year-old who marched in protests against the Iraq war, I admired his stance on the issue. But his alcoholism was treated as a joke by the press and many of his peers, even after he stepped down from the leadership. On the comedy panel show Have I Got News For You, Jeremy Clarkson introduced Kennedy by saying: \u201cOn Paul Merton\u2019s team tonight is a man who, after confessing to a drinking problem, reported that four party officials cornered him in his private office \u2013 although later it transpired that there were only two of them \u2013 Charles Kennedy!\u201d In June 2015, Kennedy died after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/05/charles-kennedy-death-caused-by-alcoholism-family-says\">suffering a major haemorrhage</a> caused by ongoing alcohol abuse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc1788dc063a698e02067ea9229352233dd9e572\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc1788dc063a698e02067ea9229352233dd9e572/146_119_5112_3069/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Labour MP Jon Ashworth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labour MP Jon Ashworth, who has spoken in the Commons about his alcoholic father.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thankfully, times have changed. When Labour MP Jon Ashworth stood up in the Commons in 2017 to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/30/alcoholic-father-inspires-shadow-health-minister-jonathan-ashworth\">talk about his alcoholic father</a>, the video of his speech went viral, and he was widely applauded for its honesty. Ashworth described how the shame his father felt about his alcoholism seeped into all areas of his life. \u201cOne of the most heartbreaking things for me was when I got married and my father felt he couldn\u2019t come to the wedding because he would be so drunk. He felt there would be well-known politicians there, and my dad, from a working-class background, felt if he was there, drunk, he would embarrass me.\u201d His father died in 2011.</p> <p>On a grey morning, I meet Ashworth in his office at Westminster\u2019s Portcullis House. He is welcoming and warm, and as we sit by his desk, he speaks passionately about the need for better services to treat alcoholism, and to protect NHS services. Though his voice softens when he recalls his childhood, he doesn\u2019t shy away from the reality of his experience. \u201cFor too long, it\u2019s been very difficult to talk about alcoholism,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople worry about speaking out because alcohol is such a huge part of our society, and nobody wants to be a killjoy. It\u2019s almost as if it\u2019s the final taboo.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We all like people who can be the life and soul of a party.

      "bodyText": "George Clarke asked his father not to text him when he went on holiday to Valencia in September 2015; he didn\u2019t want his father to be charged the extra fees. When Clarke, 25, landed back in the UK a week later, he headed straight to the restaurant where he worked as a waiter. His boss told him that one of his father\u2019s neighbours had called while he was away \u2013 she was concerned about his father. Clarke had had messages like this before, and figuring his father was on one of his regular drinking binges, ignored her message. But two weeks later, the same neighbour called again. Clarke drove to his father\u2019s flat, two miles from where he lived in Holmfirth, Yorkshire. No lights were on, and no one answered. He looked through a window and saw a loaf of bread on the kitchen counter that had turned blue and was surrounded by flies. He called the police. \u201cThe next thing I knew, there was this big, 6ft 8in man covered in tattoos outside the flat with one of those battering rams they use in drug raids, trying to smash the door down,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cI had a chuckle to myself, as the whole moment was quite slapstick, and my dad would have laughed, watching these officers trying to knock his old wooden door down.\u201d Once inside, the police found Clarke\u2019s father upstairs. A postmortem later revealed he had been dead for three weeks. Clarke has been grappling with that day since. \u201cI get a heaviness in my chest when I talk about this,\u201d he says. His parents divorced when he was 13; as a teenager, Clarke would visit his father two or three times a week with his two younger brothers, and spend the rest of his time with his mother. He remembers a time his father drove them to school, when Clarke was 15. \u201cLooking back, I realise he was absolutely out of it. He was in a jovial mood, singing at the top of his lungs. And as a child I didn\u2019t realise it was abnormal. The smell of alcohol was normal to me. It became part of the fabric of my childhood.\u201d Clarke would find bottles of alcohol hidden around the house; in the cereal cupboard, or the washing basket. He became estranged from his father when he stopped coming to his rugby matches, and missed his graduation from Newcastle University. \u201cEveryone was there with their family. And I bought him a ticket and offered him a drive up, and he said he\u2019d come, and then he went silent for a week,\u201d he says. His father\u2019s behaviour has affected his relationships. \u201cYou put your faith in someone,\u201d he says, \u201cbut if you\u2019re not sure that faith is 100% well placed, you get hurt over and over again. There\u2019s a cynic in me that thinks, well my dad lied to me, so why shouldn\u2019t someone else?\u201d *** Many children of alcoholics now have a dead parent, whether or not alcoholism is explicitly referenced on the death certificate. Alcoholism has long been recognised as a deadly disease, but there is far less awareness of its hidden victims: the children of alcoholics. A 2017 study by the University of Sheffield found that more than 200,000 children across England live with an alcoholic parent; other research has put the number of people in the UK affected by a parent\u2019s problem drinking at 2.6 million. I grew up in a home affected by alcoholism. My father, whom I never knew, suffered from alcoholism all his life. My parents divorced by the time I was six, and my mother raised me and my seven siblings alone. But she also battled with depression and alcoholism, and it swallowed much of the joy from her life. She died when I was 16. Like many children of alcoholics, I tried to reason with my mother in an effort to stop her drinking. But when you\u2019re 13, the last thing you want to be doing is begging a parent to stop hiding bottles of wine down the side of the bed, or spending your time persuading them that their life is, in fact, worth living. Children grow used to an alcoholic\u2019s many contradictions. My mother was a fiercely intelligent, empathetic person, who went from nursing in a mental hospital to completing a politics degree at the age of 40. I would love to inherit her good qualities, but I also don\u2019t want to end up like the person she was at her weakest; when she had truly fallen victim to alcohol. Children who were raised by an alcoholic parent share a bond; we are part of a club we never signed up to. My older sister thought that if people knew about our parents\u2019 illness, our family would appear broken or dysfunctional. This went for me and some of my other siblings, too. For decades, we hid the true extent of our childhood experiences from others, because we just wanted to be \u201cnormal\u201d. Instead we have tried to live the best lives we can as adults, and supported each other. I am the third youngest, and my older siblings bore the brunt of my mother\u2019s illness, shielding the rest of us. While he was at university, my older brother spoke to my mother on the phone every night and tried to talk her out of a depressive spiral. When she died, my older sister Mary, who was 22 at the time, became legal guardian to me, my younger sister and brother, who were 13 and 15. We might otherwise have been separated and put into care. Today, some of my siblings drink, and some of them don\u2019t. I enjoy social drinking. Since children of alcoholics are far more likely to become alcoholics themselves, I sometimes wonder how much our parents\u2019 illnesses were hereditary, and whether we\u2019re ever fully in control. While I\u2019m confident I won\u2019t develop a problem with alcohol, I have a solid support system around me, of good friends and family. But I\u2019m not so sure things would have turned out this way without them. Over the past year, there has been an increased focus on helping children of alcoholics. In April last year, the Department of Health and Social Care, and the Department for Work and Pensions, jointly announced \u00a36m of funding. The plans include fast access to children\u2019s mental health services, and programmes to treat parents\u2019 addiction. The funding will also speed up the identification of children who are at risk, in the hope of reducing the numbers being taken into care. Stigma and shame have prevented many children from talking about the repercussions on their own health and wellbeing, but according to the National Association for Children of Alcoholics (NACOA), psychiatric problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and bulimia are common. I wanted to speak to others who grew up like me; to hear their stories, their coping mechanisms, and understand how they got through it. *** As one of the few people of colour in a very white area of Sunderland, Bindy Galsinh tells me she often felt isolated, forced to grapple with her father\u2019s alcoholism alone. \u201cIt felt like my brothers and I were the only brown people in the north-east of England at the time. And there was massive stigma in our [Sikh] community. All of my aunts and uncles knew about his problem, because when they\u2019d visit us they\u2019d see him drunk. But all of my family, even my grandmas, would act like: \u2018That\u2019s the way it is, keep it hush-hush.\u2019\u201d When Galsinh\u2019s father was drunk, he was aggressive and unpredictable. \u201cHe\u2019d stay up and watch television all night. I remember when I was 10, I woke up to go to the toilet and was so scared of making any noise in the bathroom that I grabbed a pint glass, weed in it, and poured it down the sink.\u201d Galsinh was diagnosed with PTSD in her 20s. She suffers from flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety and depression. She compares growing up with an alcoholic parent to living in \u201ca war zone\u201d, because you never know what is coming. \u201cWe don\u2019t develop like other people. We didn\u2019t grow up with safety around us.\u201d She feared being defined by her father\u2019s alcoholism in the eyes of friends or family. \u201cIt\u2019s the look that says, \u2018There must be something wrong with you, because he wouldn\u2019t drink this much.\u2019 It\u2019s worse than shame.\u201d Today, if Galsinh goes out, she has a drink. She chose not to be teetotal because she wants to prove she has control over alcohol, and does so with the support of friends. \u201cTo some weird degree, I drink because I want to feel closer to what he went through. I need to understand. You want to feel power over it.\u201d Galsinh\u2019s father died in 2013. She says she feels guilty for not grieving for him. \u201cI was grieving for myself. That I could have been more if I had the support. I was grieving for the fact I didn\u2019t deserve any of that.\u201d She has few happy memories of her father, she says, although, \u201cHe was the cleverest person I\u2019ve ever met. If anything was broken he could fix it.\u201d *** My earliest memories of alcoholism being discussed in public life are in relation to the Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy. To me, he seemed a committed politician, and as a 13-year-old who marched in protests against the Iraq war, I admired his stance on the issue. But his alcoholism was treated as a joke by the press and many of his peers, even after he stepped down from the leadership. On the comedy panel show Have I Got News For You, Jeremy Clarkson introduced Kennedy by saying: \u201cOn Paul Merton\u2019s team tonight is a man who, after confessing to a drinking problem, reported that four party officials cornered him in his private office \u2013 although later it transpired that there were only two of them \u2013 Charles Kennedy!\u201d In June 2015, Kennedy died after suffering a major haemorrhage caused by ongoing alcohol abuse. Thankfully, times have changed. When Labour MP Jon Ashworth stood up in the Commons in 2017 to talk about his alcoholic father, the video of his speech went viral, and he was widely applauded for its honesty. Ashworth described how the shame his father felt about his alcoholism seeped into all areas of his life. \u201cOne of the most heartbreaking things for me was when I got married and my father felt he couldn\u2019t come to the wedding because he would be so drunk. He felt there would be well-known politicians there, and my dad, from a working-class background, felt if he was there, drunk, he would embarrass me.\u201d His father died in 2011. On a grey morning, I meet Ashworth in his office at Westminster\u2019s Portcullis House. He is welcoming and warm, and as we sit by his desk, he speaks passionately about the need for better services to treat alcoholism, and to protect NHS services. Though his voice softens when he recalls his childhood, he doesn\u2019t shy away from the reality of his experience. \u201cFor too long, it\u2019s been very difficult to talk about alcoholism,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople worry about speaking out because alcohol is such a huge part of our society, and nobody wants to be a killjoy. It\u2019s almost as if it\u2019s the final taboo.\u201d Ashworth, along with a cross-bench group of MPs, is leading an effort to tackle alcoholism and to better support the children of alcoholics. Almost all local authorities have seen cuts to drug and alcohol services that specifically support children, with a total of \u00a38.3m slashed by 70 councils in 2017. Between 2015 and 2021, 95 local authorities are reducing their alcohol treatment and prevention budgets by \u00a36.5m. Though the \u00a36m in funding promised last April won\u2019t make up the shortfall, Ashworth has praised it as a \u201creal breakthrough\u201d. The cash will be shared with charities and child helplines. The All-Party Group for Children of Alcoholics is chaired by another Labour MP, Liam Byrne, also the son of an alcoholic. Its research has found that more than one in three deaths or serious injuries caused by neglect or abuse of a child are linked to parental drinking. Ashworth says his father was never physically abusive, but he still feels the shame that many children of alcoholics experience, even as adults. \u201cBy talking about my father, it\u2019s as if I\u2019m somehow betraying the memory of him, because I\u2019m talking about his problems. People would say to me, \u2018Isn\u2019t he a great laugh, because he\u2019s always drunk?\u2019 We all like people who can be the life and soul of a party. But what happens at the end of it, when the band stops playing and the curtains are drawn and everyone goes, and it\u2019s just me and him left alone in the house?\u201d Alcoholism is often portrayed as a problem isolated to poorer families, but Ashworth notes that alcoholics can often be high-functioning and hold down demanding jobs. \u201cIf you\u2019re living in a chaotic household, the system is looking out for you. But there\u2019s a whole cohort of children who will never get spotted because, on the outside, their parents are holding down respectable, middle-class jobs.

I have always wanted to be an MP and I achieved it.\u201d He pauses. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s because I had to grow up quickly. And I want others to know they don\u2019t need to suffer in silence.\u201d *** Kate Jones has her own set of rules for drinking alcohol: she doesn\u2019t drink when she\u2019s alone, before lunchtime, or when she\u2019s sad. And she doesn\u2019t drink to get drunk. \u201cBut sometimes I break them,\u201d she says, laughing.

In many ways, the taboo is as dangerous as the disease. It\u2019s time to let it go. \u2022 National Association for Children of Alcoholics: nacoa.org.uk, 0800 358 3456. Commenting on this piece?

      "body": "<p>The weather may have turned arctic, but frostbitten fingers won\u2019t get you out of doing your tax return. HM Revenue &amp; Customs has issued a list of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/self-assessment-returns-unbelievable-excuses-and-dubious-expenses\" title=\"\">the most bizarre (and unsuccessful) excuses</a> it received from customers who missed last year\u2019s self-assessment deadline. They included \u201cMy boiler had broken and my fingers were too cold to type\u201d.</p> <p>If you have been putting off the day when you have to gather up all your bits of paper and sit down and fill in the form, you are not alone.</p> <p>With just six days to go until the deadline of 11.59pm on Thursday 31 January, it emerged this week that as many as 3.5 million people still haven\u2019t filed their tax return. This was the figure as of Wednesday this week \u2013 it will probably have come down a little since then. Just over 8m returns had been sent in.</p> <p>So make this the weekend that you get your form done and dusted. Here are our top tips for reducing the financial pain.</p> <h2><strong>Take advantage of new allowances</strong></h2> <p>Good news for Airbnbers and eBayers: you can now get a \u00a31,000-a-year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/21/sharing-economy-1000-tax-free-allowances-ebay-airbnb-micro-entrepreneurs\" title=\"\">tax-free allowance for property income and trading income</a> (if you have both types, you will get a \u00a31,000 allowance for each). So if your annual gross income from renting out a property, land or a room is \u00a31,000 or less, you won\u2019t have to tell HMRC or declare it on your tax return. That could include money you made from letting out rooms on Airbnb or renting out your driveway as a parking space.</p> <p>Similarly, if your annual gross income from self-employment (such as selling items on eBay, at car boot sales or via classified ads, or baking cakes), or from casual jobs such as babysitting or gardening, or from hiring out your equipment such as power tools, is \u00a31,000 or less, you won\u2019t usually have to declare this.</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t miss out on pension tax relief</strong></h2> <p>The way it works depends on what scheme you are in. \u201cNet pay\u201d arrangements are used by many traditional workplace pension schemes and don\u2019t require you to do anything to get tax relief. With these, your pension contributions are deducted from your salary by your employer before income tax is calculated on it, so you get relief on the amount immediately at your highest rate of tax, <a href=\"https://www.litrg.org.uk/latest-news/news/181214-do-you-understand-how-tax-relief-your-pension-contributions-works\" title=\"\">says the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group</a>.</p> <p>However, the rules are different if you are in a \u201crelief at source\u201d arrangement that is used by personal and stakeholder pensions, as well as some \u201cautomatic enrolment\u201d workplace schemes. If you are a 20% taxpayer, no further adjustment needs to be made. But higher-rate and additional-rate taxpayers must make a claim via their tax return to receive the extra relief due to them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you have the cash spare, you can make a charity donation now and use it to reduce your tax bill for 2017-18</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some big schemes operate on a \u201crelief at source\u201d basis: for example, the publicly owned Nest (National Employment Savings Trust) scheme, set up by the government as part of the automatic enrolment revolution, is one of them. Nest has more than 6.4 million members.</p> <p>Many people who earned above \u00a345,000 in 2017-18 are failing to claim the valuable extra relief due to them, effectively handing the government a cash windfall. It is an incredibly widespread issue at this time of year, says Tim Stovold, head of tax at accountant Kingston Smith. If you are not sure which kind of scheme you are in, check with your employer.</p> <h2><strong>Use buy-to-let tax breaks</strong> </h2> <p>Landlords are up in arms about the fact <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/dec/29/your-money-in-2019-what-to-look-out-for-in-the-year-ahead\" title=\"\">they are losing valuable tax relief</a> on their buy-to-let mortgage costs. However, if you pay tax at 40% or above and are a buy-to-letter, you can claim tax relief on 75% of any mortgage interest payments on your 2017-18 tax return, says Sean Jones at wealth management firm James Hambro &amp; Partners. This interest relief is being slashed from 100% to zero, with the change being gradually phased in between April 2017 and April 2020. It is being replaced by a new 20% \u201ctax credit\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Avoid tax penalties on child benefit</strong></h2> <p>Thousands of families have been dragged into self-assessment because one or both parents have an income of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/01/high-earner-tax-penalty-child-benefit-50000-salary-pension\" title=\"\">more than \u00a350,000</a>. Under the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-tax-charge\" title=\"\">high income child benefit charge</a>, these people have their benefit clawed back on a sliding scale. This is probably more relevant for next year\u2019s tax return, but there are ways you can reduce the tax hit and, in some cases, escape the charge completely \u2013 most notably by paying more into your pension. Any contributions made into a company or personal pension scheme will reduce your \u201cadjusted net income\u201d (your total taxable income, minus things such as pension contributions), which is what the tax charge is based on. For example, you could pay additional voluntary contributions into your occupational scheme.</p> <h2><strong>Claim gift aid at the higher rate</strong></h2> <p>Donating through <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/donating-to-charity/gift-aid\" title=\"\">gift aid</a> means charities can claim an extra 25p for every \u00a31 you give. It won\u2019t cost you any extra. And if you are a higher-rate taxpayer, you can claim the difference via your tax return. Let\u2019s say you donated \u00a3100 to a charity and it claimed gift aid to make your donation \u00a3125. You pay 40% tax, so you can personally claim back \u00a325 (20% of \u00a3125).</p> <h2><strong>Make a charity donation now to reduce your tax bill for last year</strong></h2> <p>You normally only declare things on your tax return that relate to the previous tax year, but with gift aid you can also claim tax relief on donations you make in the current tax year (in fact, right up to when you send in your return). In other words, says Sarah Coles at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, if you have the cash spare, you can make a donation now and use it to reduce your tax bill for 2017-18. \u201cThis is particularly useful when you are a higher-rate taxpayer in one year and then pay the basic rate the following year, and want the higher rate of relief on your donation.\u201d </p> <h2><strong>Make the most of your spouse or civil partner</strong></h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/marriage-allowance\" title=\"\">marriage allowance</a> is a tax break that took effect in 2015 and millions of couples are eligible, but by all accounts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/23/230-pounds-marriage-allowance-hasnt-been-claimed\" title=\"\">take-up has been dismal</a>. You could benefit as a couple if your earnings in the 2017-18 tax year were less than \u00a311,500 and your partner\u2019s income was less than \u00a345,000. For the purposes of your tax return, the allowance lets you transfer \u00a31,150 of your personal allowance to your husband, wife or civil partner if they earn more than you. This reduces their tax by up to \u00a3230 in the 2017-18 tax year. For more information go to gov.uk/marriage-allowance.</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t forget to claim for expenses</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIf you subscribe to magazines or newspapers for work, you should be claiming these as expenses,\u201d says Coles. \u201cYou can also claim for any clothing you use exclusively for work. You can\u2019t claim for a suit \u2013 even if you only ever wear it for work \u2013 but outfits featuring your work logo, uniforms and protective clothes all count.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Have you declared everything?</strong></h2> <p>People often forget what savings accounts and/or investments they have, which means they end up leaving out one or more sources of income. For example, you have to include interest you have received from peer-to-peer loans, credit union and friendly society accounts, and interest on payment protection insurance compensation payouts.</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t forget the penalties</strong></h2> <p>The initial <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns/penalties\" title=\"\">fine for a late tax return</a> is \u00a3100, which applies even if there\u2019s no tax to pay. After three months, there are additional daily penalties of \u00a310 a day, up to a maximum of \u00a3900. After six months there\u2019s a further penalty of 5% of the tax due or \u00a3300, whichever is greater, and after 12 months, another 5% or \u00a3300 charge. There are also penalties for paying late.</p> <h2><strong>So who needs to do a tax return?</strong></h2> <p>Broadly speaking, you need to if any of these apply: you are a self-employed sole trader or limited company director; you earned more than \u00a32,500 from renting out property; you are a shareholder; you or your partner received child benefit and either of you had an annual income of more than \u00a350,000; you received more than \u00a32,500 in other untaxed income, for example from tips or commission, or are an employee claiming expenses totalling more than \u00a32,500; you earn more than \u00a3100,000 a year; or you earned income from abroad that you need to pay tax on.</p> <h2><strong>Have you registered?</strong></h2> <p>The bad news is that if you didn\u2019t do a return last year, you will need to sign up first and, according to HMRC, this can take up to 20 working days.

      "bodyText": "The weather may have turned arctic, but frostbitten fingers won\u2019t get you out of doing your tax return. HM Revenue &amp; Customs has issued a list of the most bizarre (and unsuccessful) excuses it received from customers who missed last year\u2019s self-assessment deadline. They included \u201cMy boiler had broken and my fingers were too cold to type\u201d. If you have been putting off the day when you have to gather up all your bits of paper and sit down and fill in the form, you are not alone. With just six days to go until the deadline of 11.59pm on Thursday 31 January, it emerged this week that as many as 3.5 million people still haven\u2019t filed their tax return. This was the figure as of Wednesday this week \u2013 it will probably have come down a little since then. Just over 8m returns had been sent in. So make this the weekend that you get your form done and dusted. Here are our top tips for reducing the financial pain. Take advantage of new allowances Good news for Airbnbers and eBayers: you can now get a \u00a31,000-a-year tax-free allowance for property income and trading income (if you have both types, you will get a \u00a31,000 allowance for each). So if your annual gross income from renting out a property, land or a room is \u00a31,000 or less, you won\u2019t have to tell HMRC or declare it on your tax return. That could include money you made from letting out rooms on Airbnb or renting out your driveway as a parking space. Similarly, if your annual gross income from self-employment (such as selling items on eBay, at car boot sales or via classified ads, or baking cakes), or from casual jobs such as babysitting or gardening, or from hiring out your equipment such as power tools, is \u00a31,000 or less, you won\u2019t usually have to declare this. Don\u2019t miss out on pension tax relief The way it works depends on what scheme you are in. \u201cNet pay\u201d arrangements are used by many traditional workplace pension schemes and don\u2019t require you to do anything to get tax relief. With these, your pension contributions are deducted from your salary by your employer before income tax is calculated on it, so you get relief on the amount immediately at your highest rate of tax, says the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group. However, the rules are different if you are in a \u201crelief at source\u201d arrangement that is used by personal and stakeholder pensions, as well as some \u201cautomatic enrolment\u201d workplace schemes. If you are a 20% taxpayer, no further adjustment needs to be made. But higher-rate and additional-rate taxpayers must make a claim via their tax return to receive the extra relief due to them. Some big schemes operate on a \u201crelief at source\u201d basis: for example, the publicly owned Nest (National Employment Savings Trust) scheme, set up by the government as part of the automatic enrolment revolution, is one of them. Nest has more than 6.4 million members. Many people who earned above \u00a345,000 in 2017-18 are failing to claim the valuable extra relief due to them, effectively handing the government a cash windfall. It is an incredibly widespread issue at this time of year, says Tim Stovold, head of tax at accountant Kingston Smith. If you are not sure which kind of scheme you are in, check with your employer. Use buy-to-let tax breaks Landlords are up in arms about the fact they are losing valuable tax relief on their buy-to-let mortgage costs. However, if you pay tax at 40% or above and are a buy-to-letter, you can claim tax relief on 75% of any mortgage interest payments on your 2017-18 tax return, says Sean Jones at wealth management firm James Hambro &amp; Partners. This interest relief is being slashed from 100% to zero, with the change being gradually phased in between April 2017 and April 2020. It is being replaced by a new 20% \u201ctax credit\u201d. Avoid tax penalties on child benefit Thousands of families have been dragged into self-assessment because one or both parents have an income of more than \u00a350,000. Under the government\u2019s high income child benefit charge, these people have their benefit clawed back on a sliding scale. This is probably more relevant for next year\u2019s tax return, but there are ways you can reduce the tax hit and, in some cases, escape the charge completely \u2013 most notably by paying more into your pension. Any contributions made into a company or personal pension scheme will reduce your \u201cadjusted net income\u201d (your total taxable income, minus things such as pension contributions), which is what the tax charge is based on. For example, you could pay additional voluntary contributions into your occupational scheme. Claim gift aid at the higher rate Donating through gift aid means charities can claim an extra 25p for every \u00a31 you give. It won\u2019t cost you any extra. And if you are a higher-rate taxpayer, you can claim the difference via your tax return. Let\u2019s say you donated \u00a3100 to a charity and it claimed gift aid to make your donation \u00a3125. You pay 40% tax, so you can personally claim back \u00a325 (20% of \u00a3125). Make a charity donation now to reduce your tax bill for last year You normally only declare things on your tax return that relate to the previous tax year, but with gift aid you can also claim tax relief on donations you make in the current tax year (in fact, right up to when you send in your return). In other words, says Sarah Coles at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, if you have the cash spare, you can make a donation now and use it to reduce your tax bill for 2017-18. \u201cThis is particularly useful when you are a higher-rate taxpayer in one year and then pay the basic rate the following year, and want the higher rate of relief on your donation.\u201d Make the most of your spouse or civil partner The marriage allowance is a tax break that took effect in 2015 and millions of couples are eligible, but by all accounts take-up has been dismal. You could benefit as a couple if your earnings in the 2017-18 tax year were less than \u00a311,500 and your partner\u2019s income was less than \u00a345,000. For the purposes of your tax return, the allowance lets you transfer \u00a31,150 of your personal allowance to your husband, wife or civil partner if they earn more than you. This reduces their tax by up to \u00a3230 in the 2017-18 tax year. For more information go to gov.uk/marriage-allowance. Don\u2019t forget to claim for expenses \u201cIf you subscribe to magazines or newspapers for work, you should be claiming these as expenses,\u201d says Coles. \u201cYou can also claim for any clothing you use exclusively for work. You can\u2019t claim for a suit \u2013 even if you only ever wear it for work \u2013 but outfits featuring your work logo, uniforms and protective clothes all count.\u201d Have you declared everything? People often forget what savings accounts and/or investments they have, which means they end up leaving out one or more sources of income. For example, you have to include interest you have received from peer-to-peer loans, credit union and friendly society accounts, and interest on payment protection insurance compensation payouts. Don\u2019t forget the penalties The initial fine for a late tax return is \u00a3100, which applies even if there\u2019s no tax to pay. After three months, there are additional daily penalties of \u00a310 a day, up to a maximum of \u00a3900. After six months there\u2019s a further penalty of 5% of the tax due or \u00a3300, whichever is greater, and after 12 months, another 5% or \u00a3300 charge. There are also penalties for paying late. So who needs to do a tax return? Broadly speaking, you need to if any of these apply: you are a self-employed sole trader or limited company director; you earned more than \u00a32,500 from renting out property; you are a shareholder; you or your partner received child benefit and either of you had an annual income of more than \u00a350,000; you received more than \u00a32,500 in other untaxed income, for example from tips or commission, or are an employee claiming expenses totalling more than \u00a32,500; you earn more than \u00a3100,000 a year; or you earned income from abroad that you need to pay tax on. Have you registered? The bad news is that if you didn\u2019t do a return last year, you will need to sign up first and, according to HMRC, this can take up to 20 working days. That\u2019s because after you register, you will get a letter that contains your unique taxpayer reference, which you use to enrol for the self-assessment online service. Once you have done this, you will be sent an activation code in the post so you can sign into your online account and file your return. \u2018My fingers were too cold to type\u2019 Five bizarre excuses HMRC received from customers who missed the self-assessment deadline (from the past year): \u2022 My mother-in-law is a witch and put a curse on me \u2022 I\u2019m too short to reach the postbox \u2022 I was too busy: my first maid left, my second maid stole from me and my third maid was very slow to learn \u2022 Our junior member of staff registered our client in self-assessment by mistake because they were not wearing their glasses \u2022 My boiler had broken and my fingers were too cold to type Tall claims Five dubious expenses claims that people included on their tax returns: \u2022 \u00a3900 for a 55-inch TV and soundbar to help a carpenter price his jobs \u2022 \u00a340 on woolly underwear ... for five years \u2022 \u00a3756 on pet insurance for a dog \u2022 A music subscription \u201cso I can listen to music while I work\u201d \u2022 A family holiday to Nigeria",

We wanted a better picture of the extent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/02/unconscious-bias-what-is-it-and-can-it-be-eliminated\">racial bias</a> faced by black, Asian and minority ethnic people in 21st-century Britain.</p> <p>The series started with a poll, asking 1,000 BAME people about their experiences of what you might call \u201cunconscious bias\u201d. It was the first major piece of public polling of its kind. People were asked whether they had experienced a range of scenarios, such as being refused entry to a restaurant for no good reason or being treated like a potential shoplifter. The poll also surveyed 1,000 white British people so comparisons could be made.</p> <p>The results were stark. Ethnic minorities were three times as likely to have been thrown out of or denied entrance to a restaurant, bar or club, while 38% of BAME people said they had been wrongly suspected of shoplifting in the past five years, compared with 14% of white people. One in four felt they had been stopped at airport security or customs because of their ethnicity.</p> <p>The poll was followed up by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/03/flatshare-bias-room-seekers-with-muslim-name-get-fewer-replies\">major piece of research into bias in the flat or house share market</a> by Haroon Siddique and Pamela Duncan. To investigate whether a Muslim name is an obstacle to finding a flat or house share, the Guardian sent expressions of interest from \u201cMuhammad\u201d and \u201cDavid\u201d to almost 1,000 online advertisements for rooms across the UK. The results suggested it is \u2013 for every 10 positive replies David received, Muhammad got only eight.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised that bias existed \u2013 you\u2019d have to be in denial to think Islamophobia isn\u2019t a problem \u2013 but the fact that it was so clear cut and the way it manifested itself did surprise me,\u201d said Siddique.</p> <p>\u201cI assumed that people put off by the name Muhammad simply wouldn\u2019t reply to him. But there were a number of instances where landlords or landladies appeared to be outrightly lying to Muhammad by telling him a room had gone or was for women only, while inviting David to view,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u201cThere were also inquiries made of Muhammad, based on prejudicial assumptions, that were made in quite an aggressive way, including emails asking whether he was an overseas student, worked in a fish factory or had a problem with dogs.\u201d</p> <p>The rigorously executed story is now being used as the basis of an academic paper by a prominent Oxford University sociologist.</p> <p>The series pointed to a number of shocking data sets that showed ethnic minorities were at a disadvantage in driving tests, in the job market, and in elections. The data also showed how unconscious bias could have a violent outcome. Poppy Noor analysed the Met\u2019s use-of-force data and found the Met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/05/met-police-use-tasers-and-restraints-more-often-against-black-people\">used Tasers on black people more than four times as often</a> as on white people, and used restraint four times as often.</p> <p>Noor said: \u201cEven the language of unconscious bias makes it sound like it\u2019s a lot more subtle than it is. There isn\u2019t an intention necessarily with unconscious bias to treat people badly, but through the data I was looking at, what I very quickly found is that the literal outcome can be violent. The way it changes how you experience life is massive.\u201d</p> <p>But Bias in Britain did not limit itself to numbers; human stories were at the centre of our reporting. I wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/dec/06/one-of-the-uks-only-black-michelin-starred-chef-racism-is-their-problem-not-mine\">a profile on Michael Caines</a>, one of the only black chefs with a Michelin star, on the barriers he faces inside and outside the kitchen. And, in a viral howl of outrage, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/03/my-name-is-nish-kumar-so-please-stop-calling-me-nish-patel\">comedian Nish Kumar made a desperate plea</a> for people to stop getting his name wrong.</p> <p>The impact of unconscious bias cannot be underestimated. It can chip away at your core, making you doubt yourself, and can leave you feeling alone.</p> <p>As I waited, separated from the other passengers boarding the plane, I was swept up with one all-consuming feeling: I don\u2019t belong. But there\u2019s something quite anchoring to be presented with data and incredible testimonies that remind me \u2013 us \u2013 that we\u2019re not making this up and we too have a stake in this grey island nation. I was moved to see the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/08/it-amazes-me-that-more-isnt-done-to-tackle-it-readers-on-bias-in-britain\">response from our readers</a> fell along these lines. Many reached out to say they finally felt seen.</p>",

The poll also surveyed 1,000 white British people so comparisons could be made. The results were stark. Ethnic minorities were three times as likely to have been thrown out of or denied entrance to a restaurant, bar or club, while 38% of BAME people said they had been wrongly suspected of shoplifting in the past five years, compared with 14% of white people. One in four felt they had been stopped at airport security or customs because of their ethnicity. The poll was followed up by a major piece of research into bias in the flat or house share market by Haroon Siddique and Pamela Duncan. To investigate whether a Muslim name is an obstacle to finding a flat or house share, the Guardian sent expressions of interest from \u201cMuhammad\u201d and \u201cDavid\u201d to almost 1,000 online advertisements for rooms across the UK. The results suggested it is \u2013 for every 10 positive replies David received, Muhammad got only eight. \u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised that bias existed \u2013 you\u2019d have to be in denial to think Islamophobia isn\u2019t a problem \u2013 but the fact that it was so clear cut and the way it manifested itself did surprise me,\u201d said Siddique. \u201cI assumed that people put off by the name Muhammad simply wouldn\u2019t reply to him. But there were a number of instances where landlords or landladies appeared to be outrightly lying to Muhammad by telling him a room had gone or was for women only, while inviting David to view,\u201d he added. \u201cThere were also inquiries made of Muhammad, based on prejudicial assumptions, that were made in quite an aggressive way, including emails asking whether he was an overseas student, worked in a fish factory or had a problem with dogs.\u201d The rigorously executed story is now being used as the basis of an academic paper by a prominent Oxford University sociologist. The series pointed to a number of shocking data sets that showed ethnic minorities were at a disadvantage in driving tests, in the job market, and in elections. The data also showed how unconscious bias could have a violent outcome. Poppy Noor analysed the Met\u2019s use-of-force data and found the Met used Tasers on black people more than four times as often as on white people, and used restraint four times as often. Noor said: \u201cEven the language of unconscious bias makes it sound like it\u2019s a lot more subtle than it is. There isn\u2019t an intention necessarily with unconscious bias to treat people badly, but through the data I was looking at, what I very quickly found is that the literal outcome can be violent. The way it changes how you experience life is massive.\u201d But Bias in Britain did not limit itself to numbers; human stories were at the centre of our reporting. I wrote a profile on Michael Caines, one of the only black chefs with a Michelin star, on the barriers he faces inside and outside the kitchen. And, in a viral howl of outrage, the comedian Nish Kumar made a desperate plea for people to stop getting his name wrong. The impact of unconscious bias cannot be underestimated. It can chip away at your core, making you doubt yourself, and can leave you feeling alone. As I waited, separated from the other passengers boarding the plane, I was swept up with one all-consuming feeling: I don\u2019t belong. But there\u2019s something quite anchoring to be presented with data and incredible testimonies that remind me \u2013 us \u2013 that we\u2019re not making this up and we too have a stake in this grey island nation. I was moved to see the response from our readers fell along these lines. Many reached out to say they finally felt seen.",

      "body": "<p>Kristen Roupenian\u2019s short story Cat Person was published by the New Yorker in December 2017 and, to the author\u2019s best recollection, it went up online on a Monday. The 37-year-old was living in Ann Arbor, Michigan, while completing a fellowship in writing, and for three or four days after the story came out, enjoyed the world\u2019s customary reaction to most fiction, and all short stories \u2013 complete indifference \u2013 while basking in the achievement of it having been published at all. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018Wow: that was the greatest thing to ever happen, and now it\u2019s over.\u2019\u201d She smiles. \u201cThen it was Friday.\u201d</p> <p>By the standards of true global celebrity, there is only so far a piece of fiction can go; as David Foster Wallace used to say, the most famous writer in the world is about as famous as a local TV weatherman. Still, what happened with Cat Person remains singular to the extent that, for what seemed like the first time in publishing history, it slammed together two alien worlds, social media and serious fiction, in a way that stretched the boundaries of literary fame.</p> <p>The story of Margot, 20, and Robert, 34, and their disastrous short-lived relationship was written a few months before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">#MeToo movement</a> took off, and by the time it came out its themes \u2013 the power imbalance between older men and younger women; the dynamics of coercion; the hideous chess game of early courtship, with its currents of self-delusion and bad, bad sex \u2013 chimed with what felt like the only conversation in town. In the weeks after Cat Person was published, it was shared millions of times, inspired spoof Twitter accounts and, after being widely mistaken for memoir, was prosecuted as part of a man-hating liberal agenda. The author, meanwhile, sat in a coffee shop in Ann Arbor, where she remained largely oblivious to the fuss. It was Callie, her girlfriend, a fellow student who is better plugged in online than Roupenian, who looked up from her laptop and said, \u201cSomething\u2019s going on with your story.\u201d</p> <p>A year later, we are in the slightly ramshackle house the two women share in southern Michigan, and everything about Roupenian\u2019s life has changed. She is still adjusting to the shock of such widespread attention \u2013 Cat Person went on to get more than 4.5m hits and become the most-read piece of online fiction the New Yorker has published \u2013 something about which, she says, \u201cI can\u2019t think without feeling shrunken. It\u2019s like everyone\u2019s talking about me, and it makes me feel small.\u201d Roupenian is slight and soft-spoken, her rapid speech underscored with a kind of urgent levity that makes even her most critical assessments sound basically amused.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For a hot second, Roupenian seemed like the world\u2019s number one authority on heterosexual dating dynamics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are practical differences to her life these days, too: most notably, after two decades of being a student (before her master\u2019s at the University of Michigan, Roupenian spent seven years on the PhD programme at Harvard) having more than one option at her disposal. Roupenian finished her fellowship last year and is waiting for Callie, a year behind her on the same programme, to catch up, after which they may move. \u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary luxury to just take a breath \u2013 the tenuous year-to-year, two- or three-year existence is so ingrained in me that I almost can\u2019t imagine thinking, \u2018Just pick a city and move!\u2019 I\u2019m still wrapping my head around it.\u201d</p> <p>There have been other adjustments. For a hot second, Roupenian seemed like the world\u2019s number one authority on heterosexual dating dynamics, and the news that she is now living with a woman was considered sufficiently thrilling to make the front page of the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/kristen-roupenian-author-of-cat-person-is-dating-a-woman-fghsfn02g\" title=\"\">Sunday Times last year</a>, much to Roupenian\u2019s horror. \u201cThe private New Englander in me \u2013 \u201d she pulls a face. \u201cThere\u2019s stuff about you that\u2019s being interpreted and that feels weird. And yet, when they did it, my sense that I have to manage how other people know about [my relationship] was suddenly out of my hands. You can Google me and know my life now! And it\u2019s actually fine.\u201d She goes deadpan for a moment. \u201cWoo. Fine.\u201d</p> <p>The biggest change to Roupenian\u2019s life has been financial. Cat Person appears as one of 12 short stories in You Know You Want This, a forthcoming collection that won Roupenian a reported $1.2m advance and is being adapted into an HBO series. The stories are mostly a triumph: savage, grotesque, often very funny, mostly to do with the inability of one person ever truly to know another, and the moves one makes to cover this up. After reading them in one gulp, it is hard not to conclude that everything is terrible and everyone is awful, and yet there is a weird kind of optimism in the fact that most of Roupenian\u2019s characters are at least 30% asshole; we are none of us unimplicated.</p> <p>In The Good Guy, far and away the best story, an amiable man named Ted, turned bitter by female rejection \u2013 this is a common theme of Roupenian\u2019s; the extent to which men rejected by women hate women, and women rejected by men hate themselves \u2013 sits with a girlfriend he despises and thinks, \u201cIt was almost existentially unsettling, that two people in such close physical proximity could be experiencing the same moment so differently.\u201d In The Mirror, The Bucket, And The Old Thigh Bone, a story that seems to have sprung fresh from the 14th century, the heroine considers the possibility that \u201cthe person she was in love with didn\u2019t exist, except in her own mind\u201d. One of the pleasures of reading Roupenian is her drive-by assassinations \u2013 \u201cEllie worked in communications, which meant that she spent 90% of her time crafting emails that no one ever read\u201d \u2013 while the big thematic plates of vanity, hubris, self-delusion, slide by underneath. \u201cThe world was pitiless,\u201d observes Ted, with weary nihilism. \u201cNobody had any power over anyone else.\u201d</p> <p>The question of power is at the heart of every story and it\u2019s something about which, Roupenian believes, one\u2019s understanding changes with age. Cat Person was inspired by a few dates she went on in her mid-30s, in a short period between the end of her relationship with a man to whom she was engaged, and meeting Callie. She hadn\u2019t dated since her early 20s and what struck her about that experience, she says, \u201cwas how messy it was. And one of the things I thought was that at 36, I have a handle on power dynamics and gender and all of this stuff. And it just seemed to me that at 20 \u2013 which is an adult, officially, at which age it is acceptable to go on a date with someone in their mid-30s \u2013 how could you possibly engage? It seems to me, now, so young.\u201d<strong> </strong>One of the reasons Roupenian wanted to write the story was to explore how hard it is to delineate what is going on when attraction and repulsion combine, and when \u2013 as one tends to at 20 \u2013 one is lying to oneself about being in control. In such a case, she says, \u201cthe complications of it are more subtle than just, \u2018Here\u2019s this jerk who\u2019s hitting on me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>At that age, says Roupenian, bad dating experiences made her feel \u201cso alone in my head that I couldn\u2019t articulate it\u201d. After her story went viral, she couldn\u2019t help thinking that \u201ceverything would\u2019ve been different for me when I was at the age of Margot if I\u2019d understood how collective some of these experiences are\u201d. Certainly when she was in her teens, she says, she would have benefited from the conversation around feminism being more nuanced than \u201ceverybody shouting \u2018Girl power\u2019 and \u2018Girls can do anything!\u2019 Which was great, but also, a lie.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cWho can say what it\u2019ll be like for babies born today, in 2040? But I have to think that knowing other people are thinking your strange, ugly thoughts is a good and comforting thing.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>One of the questions Roupenian asks repeatedly in her fiction is to what extent one can ever clearly see the person to whom one is attracted. It\u2019s a tendency among women to interpret their partners in a way that, Roupenian realised recently, is deeply gendered and completely unhelpful. \u201cOften in relationships between men and women, there is this weird pact that it\u2019s the women\u2019s job to interpret their relationship for the men. That they have a right to say, \u2018The problem with you is that you\u2019re afraid of commitment, and if only you would show up at my house at an approximately reasonable time then we would be fine.\u2019 And that is bullshit: that the men are ready to outsource their own understanding of themselves to the women, and that the women will do that job so the men will do what they want. And yet it\u2019s a sort of agreed-upon game.\u201d</p> <p>Has the dynamic been different in her current relationship? \u201cI do think [that dynamic] can be true of two women, and maybe of two men, but I feel like the relationship that Callie and I have is one in which we recognise it\u2019s not either person\u2019s job to explain the other person \u2013 and that that\u2019s actually a power grab. I think we all grab for different kinds of power, and maybe as writers you come to the world thinking, \u2018I understand why people act the way they do, and that ought to give me a certain amount of power.\u2019 But the fact is, people do what they want to do. There\u2019s always a moment, whenever you\u2019re having a fight, when you think, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve solved it!\u2019 And the other person is like, \u2018Well, congratulations to you, I will continue to live my own life. Please back off.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d67cbbfa95a6b3ee062ac1330b659c64c2e76fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d67cbbfa95a6b3ee062ac1330b659c64c2e76fe/811_952_3662_2197/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kristen Roupenian\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kristen Roupenian: \u201cMy whole life became a trending hashtag.\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chuk Nowak/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is these sorts of observations, and the sexual frankness of some of the stories, that have made Roupenian\u2019s work uncomfortable reading for some of the men in her family. Roupenian \u2013 her father is of Armenian heritage \u2013 grew up outside Boston, where her mother, a retired nurse, and her sister remain. (Her father, from whom her mother is divorced, is in Alaska with her brother.) It\u2019s not that her dad, a doctor, isn\u2019t supportive, she says. \u201cBut there\u2019s such a split in my family where the women are reading the stories and loving them and we have just decided, with some of the men, that we\u2019re not going to talk about it.\u201d She bursts out laughing. \u201cThe book is dedicated to my mum, and when Cat Person got published I had to read it aloud for the podcast. We were all waiting for my sister\u2019s baby to be born, so I was like, \u2018Ma, I have to practise\u2019. And I read this rabid sex scene aloud to my mum and she was just so cool with it. She has only ever been wildly supportive of my writing and seems to get it, viscerally.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>In high school, Roupenian worked on the literary magazine, but although she knew she was good at writing, she didn\u2019t have any particular longing to become a writer. \u201cAt that stage it felt like work,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was some sense of obligation that was deadening.

But I think it requires a lifetime of learning to recognise the patterns.\u201d For Roupenian, it has been a case of recognising a tendency to overestimate the extent to which \u201csomeone else has control over my happiness and ability to move in the world\u201d, and, by extension, her control over others: \u201cThat if you\u2019re unhappy it\u2019s my fault, and my job to fix it.

But that is contradicted by the thing I have felt increasingly as I get older, which is that I do not have the power to make you happy; my ability to fix you is so limited; and my desire to fix you is complicated.

One has to remain somewhat vulnerable, surely? \u201cYou can be vulnerable, it\u2019s true \u2013 it\u2019s an endless negotiation, and in relationships that have been difficult for me, feeling like loving someone meant trying to save them. For a long time I thought that was a critical part of loving someone, in a way that I do think codes female. It seems deeply embedded in ideas of what it means to be a good woman. Of helping people fix themselves; changing them a little, seeing the subtle violence and reaching for control.\u201d</p> <p>Roupenian does not think that now; in fact, these impulses strike her as downright unhealthy. Her self-protective instincts have been sharpened by the experience of Cat Person going viral. As the emails started flooding in, she grew truly alarmed. (These ranged from the re-emergence of friends from the deep past, to creepy emails from men describing their sexual encounters, to offers from media outlets around the globe to come on their shows and explain herself.)</p> <p>\u201cThere is so much thoughtful, smart conversation around the story, but \u2013 and this is inherent to conversations on the internet \u2013 it is entwined with such vitriol and visceral emotion.

It\u2019s too strange and disorienting.\u201d</p> <p>The oddest thing about the whole experience, she says, was how it seemed simultaneously huge and, like everything else on the internet, deeply transient and trivial. \u201cYou saw both everybody suddenly giving a shit, but also not at all \u2013 it was just a trending hashtag, a piece of entertainment. That was my whole life! That\u2019s what\u2019s so weird about how it makes you feel wrong\u2011sized. You\u2019re only ever going to be a flash in other people\u2019s brain pans, and it\u2019s weird to see that reflected back at yourself.\u201d</p> <p>One of the funniest outcomes has been the extent to which, in book events and other public appearances, Roupenian has come to be regarded as a kind of relationship guru, something that makes her laugh, given how screwed up every single character in her book is. \u201cIt\u2019s funny to imagine people reading the stories and thinking: \u2018I should take advice from her!\u2019\u201d What people are responding to, in fact, is a generosity in the writing; a fundamental understanding that good, or good-ish people, can still end up causing enormous pain, powered by self-loathing and a commitment to an unworkable persona. Margot doesn\u2019t want to sleep with Robert, but feels it\u2019s too late to back out; Ted doesn\u2019t want to date Rachel, but it seems absurd to break up with her out of the blue. (\u201cIf he tried to break up with Rachel right now, while she was halfway through a breadstick, surely the first thing she\u2019d say would be, \u2018If you knew you were going to break up with me, why did you literally just agree to go with me to visit my cousin on Sunday?\u2019 and he would have no answer.\u201d)</p> <p>No one is on trial in these stories, she says. \u201cIn terms of what I\u2019m interested in, I write a character from a place of disconcerted surprise at their own behaviour \u2013 of people who can\u2019t quite navigate where they are. Those feelings of \u2018I don\u2019t understand how I got here\u2019, or \u2018I came here with good intentions, and now I\u2019m causing harm\u2019 \u2013 they cross gender boundaries, and probably all boundaries.\u201d</p> <p>In the end, it comes down to storytelling, she says. Looking back at her dating life, she is amazed at the times when \u201cI have spun out in relationships where later I was like, you knew that person for a <em>week</em>. To me, part of the anxiety that can come in romantic relationships is, \u2018I have a story that is unravelling.\u2019 That can be really hard. It\u2019s caught up in ego, and power, and control. Which is separate from \u2018Maybe this person likes me, maybe they don\u2019t.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It is a great relief to be on the other side of all that, says Roupenian, and to have a tiny grain of perspective. It may be that, as per her stories, everything is terrible and everyone is awful, but the wisdom of one\u2019s late 30s is also a wonderful thing. \u201cI read something recently that said very straightforwardly that flirting is a management of information. As soon as you know for sure what\u2019s going on, the flirting stage is over. The flirting is \u2018I\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d She grins. \u201cPut that way, I thought, \u2018Oh: maybe it\u2019s not that bad.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 You Know You Want This by Kristen Roupenian is published on 7 February by Jonathan Cape at \u00a312.99.

      "bodyText": "Kristen Roupenian\u2019s short story Cat Person was published by the New Yorker in December 2017 and, to the author\u2019s best recollection, it went up online on a Monday. The 37-year-old was living in Ann Arbor, Michigan, while completing a fellowship in writing, and for three or four days after the story came out, enjoyed the world\u2019s customary reaction to most fiction, and all short stories \u2013 complete indifference \u2013 while basking in the achievement of it having been published at all. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018Wow: that was the greatest thing to ever happen, and now it\u2019s over.\u2019\u201d She smiles. \u201cThen it was Friday.\u201d By the standards of true global celebrity, there is only so far a piece of fiction can go; as David Foster Wallace used to say, the most famous writer in the world is about as famous as a local TV weatherman. Still, what happened with Cat Person remains singular to the extent that, for what seemed like the first time in publishing history, it slammed together two alien worlds, social media and serious fiction, in a way that stretched the boundaries of literary fame. The story of Margot, 20, and Robert, 34, and their disastrous short-lived relationship was written a few months before the #MeToo movement took off, and by the time it came out its themes \u2013 the power imbalance between older men and younger women; the dynamics of coercion; the hideous chess game of early courtship, with its currents of self-delusion and bad, bad sex \u2013 chimed with what felt like the only conversation in town. In the weeks after Cat Person was published, it was shared millions of times, inspired spoof Twitter accounts and, after being widely mistaken for memoir, was prosecuted as part of a man-hating liberal agenda. The author, meanwhile, sat in a coffee shop in Ann Arbor, where she remained largely oblivious to the fuss. It was Callie, her girlfriend, a fellow student who is better plugged in online than Roupenian, who looked up from her laptop and said, \u201cSomething\u2019s going on with your story.\u201d A year later, we are in the slightly ramshackle house the two women share in southern Michigan, and everything about Roupenian\u2019s life has changed. She is still adjusting to the shock of such widespread attention \u2013 Cat Person went on to get more than 4.5m hits and become the most-read piece of online fiction the New Yorker has published \u2013 something about which, she says, \u201cI can\u2019t think without feeling shrunken. It\u2019s like everyone\u2019s talking about me, and it makes me feel small.\u201d Roupenian is slight and soft-spoken, her rapid speech underscored with a kind of urgent levity that makes even her most critical assessments sound basically amused. There are practical differences to her life these days, too: most notably, after two decades of being a student (before her master\u2019s at the University of Michigan, Roupenian spent seven years on the PhD programme at Harvard) having more than one option at her disposal. Roupenian finished her fellowship last year and is waiting for Callie, a year behind her on the same programme, to catch up, after which they may move. \u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary luxury to just take a breath \u2013 the tenuous year-to-year, two- or three-year existence is so ingrained in me that I almost can\u2019t imagine thinking, \u2018Just pick a city and move!\u2019 I\u2019m still wrapping my head around it.\u201d There have been other adjustments. For a hot second, Roupenian seemed like the world\u2019s number one authority on heterosexual dating dynamics, and the news that she is now living with a woman was considered sufficiently thrilling to make the front page of the Sunday Times last year, much to Roupenian\u2019s horror. \u201cThe private New Englander in me \u2013 \u201d she pulls a face. \u201cThere\u2019s stuff about you that\u2019s being interpreted and that feels weird. And yet, when they did it, my sense that I have to manage how other people know about [my relationship] was suddenly out of my hands. You can Google me and know my life now! And it\u2019s actually fine.\u201d She goes deadpan for a moment. \u201cWoo. Fine.\u201d The biggest change to Roupenian\u2019s life has been financial. Cat Person appears as one of 12 short stories in You Know You Want This, a forthcoming collection that won Roupenian a reported $1.2m advance and is being adapted into an HBO series. The stories are mostly a triumph: savage, grotesque, often very funny, mostly to do with the inability of one person ever truly to know another, and the moves one makes to cover this up. After reading them in one gulp, it is hard not to conclude that everything is terrible and everyone is awful, and yet there is a weird kind of optimism in the fact that most of Roupenian\u2019s characters are at least 30% asshole; we are none of us unimplicated. In The Good Guy, far and away the best story, an amiable man named Ted, turned bitter by female rejection \u2013 this is a common theme of Roupenian\u2019s; the extent to which men rejected by women hate women, and women rejected by men hate themselves \u2013 sits with a girlfriend he despises and thinks, \u201cIt was almost existentially unsettling, that two people in such close physical proximity could be experiencing the same moment so differently.\u201d In The Mirror, The Bucket, And The Old Thigh Bone, a story that seems to have sprung fresh from the 14th century, the heroine considers the possibility that \u201cthe person she was in love with didn\u2019t exist, except in her own mind\u201d. One of the pleasures of reading Roupenian is her drive-by assassinations \u2013 \u201cEllie worked in communications, which meant that she spent 90% of her time crafting emails that no one ever read\u201d \u2013 while the big thematic plates of vanity, hubris, self-delusion, slide by underneath. \u201cThe world was pitiless,\u201d observes Ted, with weary nihilism. \u201cNobody had any power over anyone else.\u201d The question of power is at the heart of every story and it\u2019s something about which, Roupenian believes, one\u2019s understanding changes with age. Cat Person was inspired by a few dates she went on in her mid-30s, in a short period between the end of her relationship with a man to whom she was engaged, and meeting Callie. She hadn\u2019t dated since her early 20s and what struck her about that experience, she says, \u201cwas how messy it was. And one of the things I thought was that at 36, I have a handle on power dynamics and gender and all of this stuff. And it just seemed to me that at 20 \u2013 which is an adult, officially, at which age it is acceptable to go on a date with someone in their mid-30s \u2013 how could you possibly engage? It seems to me, now, so young.\u201d One of the reasons Roupenian wanted to write the story was to explore how hard it is to delineate what is going on when attraction and repulsion combine, and when \u2013 as one tends to at 20 \u2013 one is lying to oneself about being in control. In such a case, she says, \u201cthe complications of it are more subtle than just, \u2018Here\u2019s this jerk who\u2019s hitting on me.\u2019\u201d At that age, says Roupenian, bad dating experiences made her feel \u201cso alone in my head that I couldn\u2019t articulate it\u201d. After her story went viral, she couldn\u2019t help thinking that \u201ceverything would\u2019ve been different for me when I was at the age of Margot if I\u2019d understood how collective some of these experiences are\u201d. Certainly when she was in her teens, she says, she would have benefited from the conversation around feminism being more nuanced than \u201ceverybody shouting \u2018Girl power\u2019 and \u2018Girls can do anything!\u2019 Which was great, but also, a lie.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cWho can say what it\u2019ll be like for babies born today, in 2040? But I have to think that knowing other people are thinking your strange, ugly thoughts is a good and comforting thing.\u201d *** One of the questions Roupenian asks repeatedly in her fiction is to what extent one can ever clearly see the person to whom one is attracted. It\u2019s a tendency among women to interpret their partners in a way that, Roupenian realised recently, is deeply gendered and completely unhelpful. \u201cOften in relationships between men and women, there is this weird pact that it\u2019s the women\u2019s job to interpret their relationship for the men. That they have a right to say, \u2018The problem with you is that you\u2019re afraid of commitment, and if only you would show up at my house at an approximately reasonable time then we would be fine.\u2019 And that is bullshit: that the men are ready to outsource their own understanding of themselves to the women, and that the women will do that job so the men will do what they want. And yet it\u2019s a sort of agreed-upon game.\u201d Has the dynamic been different in her current relationship? \u201cI do think [that dynamic] can be true of two women, and maybe of two men, but I feel like the relationship that Callie and I have is one in which we recognise it\u2019s not either person\u2019s job to explain the other person \u2013 and that that\u2019s actually a power grab. I think we all grab for different kinds of power, and maybe as writers you come to the world thinking, \u2018I understand why people act the way they do, and that ought to give me a certain amount of power.\u2019 But the fact is, people do what they want to do. There\u2019s always a moment, whenever you\u2019re having a fight, when you think, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve solved it!\u2019 And the other person is like, \u2018Well, congratulations to you, I will continue to live my own life. Please back off.\u2019\u201d It is these sorts of observations, and the sexual frankness of some of the stories, that have made Roupenian\u2019s work uncomfortable reading for some of the men in her family. Roupenian \u2013 her father is of Armenian heritage \u2013 grew up outside Boston, where her mother, a retired nurse, and her sister remain. (Her father, from whom her mother is divorced, is in Alaska with her brother.) It\u2019s not that her dad, a doctor, isn\u2019t supportive, she says. \u201cBut there\u2019s such a split in my family where the women are reading the stories and loving them and we have just decided, with some of the men, that we\u2019re not going to talk about it.\u201d She bursts out laughing. \u201cThe book is dedicated to my mum, and when Cat Person got published I had to read it aloud for the podcast. We were all waiting for my sister\u2019s baby to be born, so I was like, \u2018Ma, I have to practise\u2019. And I read this rabid sex scene aloud to my mum and she was just so cool with it. She has only ever been wildly supportive of my writing and seems to get it, viscerally.\u201d *** In high school, Roupenian worked on the literary magazine, but although she knew she was good at writing, she didn\u2019t have any particular longing to become a writer. \u201cAt that stage it felt like work,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was some sense of obligation that was deadening. When I went to college, I felt so happy to do something new.\u201d She studied first at Barnard, in New York, where her academic interests were health and psychology. For a while, she thought she might have a career in non-profits and, at the age of 21, went into the Peace Corps, spending a year volunteering in Kenya. It was after returning to Boston and getting an interim job as a nanny that she decided to turn her experiences in Kenya into a novel. \u201cBut the truth is, you can\u2019t write about something if you don\u2019t understand it. I realise now that I was exhausted, because I was being a nanny for 50 hours a week, and so I had writer\u2019s block and couldn\u2019t come up with anything. It became this miserable endeavour that I set aside, to go to grad school for English. I thought, \u2018Oh, if I can\u2019t write books, I\u2019ll write about them.\u2019\u201d In the end, while doing her PhD at Harvard, she ended up writing a \u201csort of thriller\u201d set in Kenya, which she wrote quickly and found very satisfying, drawing on \u201cthe tools of tension and dread and revulsion\u201d she had loved reading in Stephen King as a child. The novel didn\u2019t sell to any publisher \u2013 \u201crightly, I think\u201d. But for the first time, she says, \u201cI thought, I believe I\u2019m close enough to do this. I have to go for it.\u201d The dynamics of thriller and horror writing were among Roupenian\u2019s first loves as a reader.

To me, part of the anxiety that can come in romantic relationships is, \u2018I have a story that is unravelling.\u2019 That can be really hard. It\u2019s caught up in ego, and power, and control. Which is separate from \u2018Maybe this person likes me, maybe they don\u2019t.\u2019\u201d It is a great relief to be on the other side of all that, says Roupenian, and to have a tiny grain of perspective. It may be that, as per her stories, everything is terrible and everyone is awful, but the wisdom of one\u2019s late 30s is also a wonderful thing. \u201cI read something recently that said very straightforwardly that flirting is a management of information. As soon as you know for sure what\u2019s going on, the flirting stage is over. The flirting is \u2018I\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d She grins. \u201cPut that way, I thought, \u2018Oh: maybe it\u2019s not that bad.\u2019\u201d \u2022 You Know You Want This by Kristen Roupenian is published on 7 February by Jonathan Cape at \u00a312.99.

Where supermarkets might have been slow to act TRJFP has gone door to door to collect waste from stores to force the issue.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not a cafe for the homeless, or a cafe for the elderly, it is not a food bank. The cafe starts from an environmental stance, to stop all this food going into landfill, and the social element of people coming together to eat and chat comes out of that,\u201d said Chrissy Weller, who set up the cafe with her friend Clare Box. \u201cWe welcome anyone here to pay as much as they feel for the food, or nothing at all.

Each new venture has to go through a due diligence check by TRJFP before being given a licence to operate.</p> <p>The movement spreads through a combination of inspiration, shared experience and determined volunteers in each local area where they operate. Weller and Box drew inspiration from the well developed network in Brighton, a city that hosts TRJFP cafes four days a week and has opened a social supermarket known as The Hub in premises provided by the council.</p> <p>The Brighton cafes have been recognised for the quality of food they put on the menu.

      "bodyText": "Mothers with toddlers at their ankles sit beside elderly men and women out for a welcome bit of company on a Monday lunchtime. Plates are piled with steaming pasta, couscous salad and warm bread rolls as the chefs wipe sweat from their foreheads in a galley kitchen next door. This is a bustling local restaurant in an affluent area of south-west London, but there is one big difference from the many fashionable cafes that line the streets of this London \u201cvillage\u201d. The food has all been saved from the bin. On Thursday Tesco announced it would be working with the charity FareShare to try to reduce food waste, but across the country a growing environmental movement has been taking matters into their own hands for months to collect and use waste food. Collected earlier that morning from a number of supermarkets which have been persuaded to hand over their waste food rather than dump it into the dustbin, the ingredients for the latest The Real Junk Food Cafe in Twickenham are used to create wholesome lunchtime meals at a pop-up restaurant. The Real Junk Food Project (TRJFP) , aims to save as much food from the bins as possible by encouraging supermarkets to hand it to the cafes instead. Where supermarkets might have been slow to act TRJFP has gone door to door to collect waste from stores to force the issue. \u201cThis is not a cafe for the homeless, or a cafe for the elderly, it is not a food bank. The cafe starts from an environmental stance, to stop all this food going into landfill, and the social element of people coming together to eat and chat comes out of that,\u201d said Chrissy Weller, who set up the cafe with her friend Clare Box. \u201cWe welcome anyone here to pay as much as they feel for the food, or nothing at all. So you get a big mix of people sitting around a table talking and eating together.\u201d The cafe in Twickenham is one of the latest to be set up under the TRJFP banner in an attempt to tackle the mountain of food waste in the UK, where 1.9 million tonnes of food are thrown away each year. Set up in 2013 by the former chef Adam Smith, there are now 127 cafes preparing and serving waste food in seven countries and 10 \u201csocial supermarkets\u201d that collect, store and distribute waste food on a much larger scale than the cafes are able to. Each new venture has to go through a due diligence check by TRJFP before being given a licence to operate. The movement spreads through a combination of inspiration, shared experience and determined volunteers in each local area where they operate. Weller and Box drew inspiration from the well developed network in Brighton, a city that hosts TRJFP cafes four days a week and has opened a social supermarket known as The Hub in premises provided by the council. The Brighton cafes have been recognised for the quality of food they put on the menu. They won two golds and a silver in the Brighton and Hove food and drink awards this year. \u201cWe work in a professional manner, we are food people who make sure everything is the best it can be,\u201d said Sarah Griffen, from Brighton TRJFP. \u201cOver four cafes we are feeding about 300 people a week, all our food was on its way to the bin. We are coming first and foremost from an environmental project and the social and community benefits come from that.\u201d Twickenham\u2019s once-a-week offering has been running for six months. \u201cWhen we started we got everything back to front. I set up a Facebook group and no one responded, nothing really happened and I was about to give up when the South West environment trust [sic] contacted me and offered to help,\u201d said Box. With the help of the environmental charity, Weller and Banks were given a venue \u2013 gold dust in an area of exorbitant rents \u2013 a room in a local community centre, the Etna, which includes a small kitchen. \u201cWe had a quiet opening because we had no idea where the food would come from or how much would come, but someone from the project told us \u2018set it up and the food will come\u2019. We started on 4 June with hot toasties from Harris and Hoole cooked on an old George Forman griddle and a donated vat of coffee,\u201d said Clare. \u201cSince we started we have saved 1.39 tonnes of food. We weigh everything that comes through the door.\u201d The menu now boasts much more sophisticated offerings, including homemade apple tarte tatin, banana bread and soups. For chefs Chrissy and Clare, who have a rota of volunteer cooks, it is a little like being in a MasterChef competition. They get a text on Sunday night alerting them to what food is available at the local supermarkets and bakeries involved, and early on Monday morning they drive to several venues to collect it. \u201cWe have no idea what food we will be given on the day. Both of us are good at putting things together out of nothing.\u201d The Twickenham cafe has inspired other similar projects. Mark Griffiths, who works with disadvantaged families and children ineight schools in the surrounding area, leapt on the idea to help the many local families struggling to feed their children.

This compares with \u00a34,195 for drivers aged 18-20.\u201d However, claims frequency among older drivers is substantially below that of younger drivers.</p> <p>Insurers are also cautious about female drivers in their 70s and 80s, who are proportionately more like to be involved in a collision than men of the same age. Insurers think this may be because they let their husband do most of the driving, then find themselves behind the wheel when he becomes disabled or dies.</p> <p>The ABI says claims history, driving record and type of vehicle are also important. \u201cBeing older should not always been seen in a negative light for insurance,\u201d it says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"476bfffc477d0dc8cd9abe454cbeb37235c9f2a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/476bfffc477d0dc8cd9abe454cbeb37235c9f2a3/0_218_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Does older mean riskier?

So why did his insurer, Saga \u2013 a specialist for older drivers \u2013 dramatically increase his premium at renewal from \u00a3717 to \u00a32,033 in December? Newton, who worked in the motor trade for much of his life, was so shocked he thought it was a printing mistake. On contacting Saga, he was told it would cut the premium to \u00a31,175, but offered no explanation as to why it had asked for more than \u00a32,000, or why he was still expected to pay 64% more than the year before. \u201cIn 2017-18 I paid \u00a3717, which in itself is a lot of money for a 1.4 litre five-door saloon. In the end I have had to pay \u00a31,097 after altering my excess to lower the premium. How can my premium be increased by such a huge amount when I am only one year older?\u201d he says. The Duke of Edinburgh, 97, was at the wheel of a Land Rover that collided with another car last week, leaving one of its passengers with a broken wrist. The accident has sparked a national debate about what critics such as Margaret Hodge MP say are \u201cabsurdly\u201d lax rules in the UK for elderly drivers. Once drivers reach 70 they must renew their licence every three years by simply completing a self-assessment form about their health. Newton says he would be happy to take further tests \u2013 he went to Rospa after watching the ITV series 100 Year Old Drivers \u2013 but says people of his age are being ripped off by insurers. When he tried shopping around online, he spent 15 minutes filling in a form at Aviva, Britain\u2019s biggest insurer, only to find it barred anybody over 84. Of the relatively few other insurers willing to quote, one wanted \u201ca staggering \u00a33,800\u201d. Aviva confirmed that it refuses applications from anyone aged 84 or over, but will offer cover to existing customers who reach that age. Newton says this means drivers aged 90-plus have a limited pool of firms to go to, giving them carte blanche to charge sky-high rates. Are older drivers riskier? Data from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) shows claims costs escalate with age. It says: \u201cIndustry claims data points to the average cost of a motor claim increasing once you are aged over 80. For drivers over the age of 90, the average motor claim is \u00a35,670. This compares with \u00a34,195 for drivers aged 18-20.\u201d However, claims frequency among older drivers is substantially below that of younger drivers. Insurers are also cautious about female drivers in their 70s and 80s, who are proportionately more like to be involved in a collision than men of the same age. Insurers think this may be because they let their husband do most of the driving, then find themselves behind the wheel when he becomes disabled or dies. The ABI says claims history, driving record and type of vehicle are also important. \u201cBeing older should not always been seen in a negative light for insurance,\u201d it says. Newton is not about to give up driving because insurers are making his life difficult. \u201cIt could be a good idea for drivers like me to be retested. I\u2019m passionately fond of driving. I\u2019ve driven up to the Isle of Skye from my home in Sussex. I drive down to Devon.\u201d He paid \u00a355 to take the Rospa course to prove he was still a good driver, but also admits to having taken a speed awareness course in Maidstone after being caught speeding. \u201cI was coming back from Eastbourne and there\u2019s that camera near the roundabout. I was doing 34mph in a 30mph zone. The speed awareness course was very good, though. And they gave everyone a ballpoint pen, and I have to say it\u2019s the best ballpoint pen I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Saga says the increase in Newton\u2019s premium was a technical error. \u201cThe renewal premium offered to Mr Newton in November 2018 was incorrect as a system error occurred,\u201d it says. \u201cWhen Mr Newton raised this, an error by the agent meant he was again quoted an incorrect premium. We have offered Mr Newton a refund of \u00a3265.04 and total compensation of \u00a3225 for the delay in resolving his complaint. He has received \u00a3175 so far and the rest will be sent to him shortly.\u201d",

Australia win the Test at nine down, with Kumara injured and unable to bat. It was always likely to be too much for Sri Lanka, batting in such unfamiliar conditions against decent pace, and so it proved: bowled out for under 150 in both innings.<br></p> <p>Patrick Cummins is the star of the show, with ten wickets in a Test match for the first time. \u201cHe is a bowler and all-rounder to absolutely savour,\u201d says Alison Mitchell, and my word he is. The first innings he took 4 for 39, the second 6 for 23, his best innings figures by a handful of runs and his best match figures by one wicket.</p> <p>Jhye Richardson was also impressive with 3 for 26 in the first innings, then 2 for 19 in the second. Mitchell Starc got his pace back, even if his rhythm and results weren\u2019t quite there. Two wicket for him in the first innings, though none in the second. And Nathan Lyon picked up one in each innings from a modest workload of 25 overs in the match.<br></p> <p>\u201cHad a couple of debuts here, so that helped,\u201d Richardson says on ABC radio, referring to other formats at the Gabba. \u201cI got to know the ground and what to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEvery single person in the team said, \u2018You deserve to be here and we\u2019re happy to have you.\u2019 Everyone in the squad. I don\u2019t actually drink, so I\u2019ll probably be having a nice Coke Zero. If I keep pushing harder and keep running in harder, I\u2019ve found things don\u2019t go my way as much. So it\u2019s about keeping myself grounded. It\u2019s a cliche to say I\u2019m concentrating on the present, but that\u2019s so important in cricket.\u201d</p> <p>Sri Lanka\u2019s bowlers did some excellent work in the one chance they had, but as injuries started to fell the pace attack it got harder. Suranga Lakmal put in a heroic effort, taking 5 for 75 as he had to take up more and more of the workload. He got the pink ball to talk once evening had arrived on the second day.</p> <p>But Australia\u2019s batting was still underwhelming, given they were facing one of the more modest attacks in Test cricket. Marnus Labuschagne and Travis Head ground out a pair of 80s and did some good work with a 166-run partnership, but otherwise there were pretty average returns. This series can\u2019t offer any answers for Australia ahead of the Ashes mid-year.</p> <p>But a win is a win, and that alone will help this young and green team to feel a bit better about life after being towelled up in the back half of the India series. They\u2019ve got another chance for a morale boost in Canberra, for the first ever Test at that venue, while Sri Lanka might be more at home on a flatter and truer batting surface.</p> <p>\u201cAs a batting unit we need to improve, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be working towards,\u201d says Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal. <br></p> <p>We will of course be there for that match starting next Friday. Thanks from all of us for reading along, and we\u2019ll see you then.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-26T07:25:12.047Z\">at 7.25am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c4c05dfe4b0a585f6e86d54\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-26T07:03:48.063Z\">7.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">WICKET!

It\u2019s my favourite part of a day.\u201d Wry from Stuart Clark on ABC radio. Lakmal is feeling more and more like a batsman with each passing delivery. He\u2019s facing Lyon and pops up a ball on the leg side but short leg can\u2019t dart far enough down the pitch to get there. Lakmal connects with a sweep next ball and gets a couple to the deep, with Joe Burns making a good tumbling save. So Lakmal tries to go down the ground, skipping down the wicket, but misses and Paine does the rest.<strong><br></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/collinsadam/status/1089056733454954496\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">All over. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AUSvSL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AUSvSL</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/DXJ7KoTpkE\">pic.twitter.com/DXJ7KoTpkE</a></p>&mdash; Adam Collins (@collinsadam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/collinsadam/status/1089056733454954496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 26, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong><br></strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-26T07:08:05.353Z\">at 7.08am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c4c04ade4b024f0efeaee77\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-26T07:01:37.194Z\">7.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>50th over: Sri Lanka 137-8 (Lakmal 22, Chameera 5)</strong> Same field for Starc, as Sri Lanka push this innings into a 50th over. They\u2019re still 51 runs behind, so no chance of avoiding an innings defeat with this pair being effectively the last. But Lakmal will give it a go! Starc bowls 146 kilometres per hour, but it\u2019s short and wide and Lakmal utterly middles his cut shot to the eastern boundary. </p> <p>That gives him confidence, too much perhaps, as he tries a back-foot square drive from a fuller ball to the same point on the rope. Degree of difficulty: beyond you, Suranga.

Dickwella drops to his knees while trying to uppercut the next ball, ending up falling over on his back.

      "bodyText": "The inevitable arrives. Australia win the Test at nine down, with Kumara injured and unable to bat. It was always likely to be too much for Sri Lanka, batting in such unfamiliar conditions against decent pace, and so it proved: bowled out for under 150 in both innings. Patrick Cummins is the star of the show, with ten wickets in a Test match for the first time. \u201cHe is a bowler and all-rounder to absolutely savour,\u201d says Alison Mitchell, and my word he is. The first innings he took 4 for 39, the second 6 for 23, his best innings figures by a handful of runs and his best match figures by one wicket. Jhye Richardson was also impressive with 3 for 26 in the first innings, then 2 for 19 in the second. Mitchell Starc got his pace back, even if his rhythm and results weren\u2019t quite there. Two wicket for him in the first innings, though none in the second. And Nathan Lyon picked up one in each innings from a modest workload of 25 overs in the match. \u201cHad a couple of debuts here, so that helped,\u201d Richardson says on ABC radio, referring to other formats at the Gabba. \u201cI got to know the ground and what to do.\u201d \u201cEvery single person in the team said, \u2018You deserve to be here and we\u2019re happy to have you.\u2019 Everyone in the squad. I don\u2019t actually drink, so I\u2019ll probably be having a nice Coke Zero. If I keep pushing harder and keep running in harder, I\u2019ve found things don\u2019t go my way as much. So it\u2019s about keeping myself grounded. It\u2019s a cliche to say I\u2019m concentrating on the present, but that\u2019s so important in cricket.\u201d Sri Lanka\u2019s bowlers did some excellent work in the one chance they had, but as injuries started to fell the pace attack it got harder. Suranga Lakmal put in a heroic effort, taking 5 for 75 as he had to take up more and more of the workload. He got the pink ball to talk once evening had arrived on the second day. But Australia\u2019s batting was still underwhelming, given they were facing one of the more modest attacks in Test cricket. Marnus Labuschagne and Travis Head ground out a pair of 80s and did some good work with a 166-run partnership, but otherwise there were pretty average returns. This series can\u2019t offer any answers for Australia ahead of the Ashes mid-year. But a win is a win, and that alone will help this young and green team to feel a bit better about life after being towelled up in the back half of the India series. They\u2019ve got another chance for a morale boost in Canberra, for the first ever Test at that venue, while Sri Lanka might be more at home on a flatter and truer batting surface. \u201cAs a batting unit we need to improve, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be working towards,\u201d says Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal. We will of course be there for that match starting next Friday. Thanks from all of us for reading along, and we\u2019ll see you then. 50.5 overs: Sri Lanka 137-8 (Chameera 5) \u201cI love it when a tailender swaps his gloves. It\u2019s my favourite part of a day.\u201d Wry from Stuart Clark on ABC radio. Lakmal is feeling more and more like a batsman with each passing delivery. He\u2019s facing Lyon and pops up a ball on the leg side but short leg can\u2019t dart far enough down the pitch to get there. Lakmal connects with a sweep next ball and gets a couple to the deep, with Joe Burns making a good tumbling save. So Lakmal tries to go down the ground, skipping down the wicket, but misses and Paine does the rest. 50th over: Sri Lanka 137-8 (Lakmal 22, Chameera 5) Same field for Starc, as Sri Lanka push this innings into a 50th over. They\u2019re still 51 runs behind, so no chance of avoiding an innings defeat with this pair being effectively the last. But Lakmal will give it a go! Starc bowls 146 kilometres per hour, but it\u2019s short and wide and Lakmal utterly middles his cut shot to the eastern boundary. That gives him confidence, too much perhaps, as he tries a back-foot square drive from a fuller ball to the same point on the rope. Degree of difficulty: beyond you, Suranga. So Lakmal gets a good stride in to the next ball and slams it down the ground for four! Fetched it a bit, but with a fairly straight bat, and so the drive screamed away in the air past Travis Head at mid off for four more. What\u2019s next? The lookaway cut shot, that\u2019s what. A la Glenn Maxwell. Except that Laxmal is coming off a slightly lower talent base. He misses it. So Starc bowls short again and Lakmal slaps another cut shot, mistiming it into the ground but getting a single. Nine from the over, and one bowler had fun. 49th over: Sri Lanka 128-8 (Lakmal 13, Chameera 5) Cummins wants that seventh, but he bowls short and wide. There\u2019s no point (specific cricket statement or general life statement?) so Lakmal cuts without much timing but with decent placement to get three runs out to the western side of the ground. Chameera hops up on his toes with a very straight-batted defensive stroke. Sri Lanka\u2019s lower order has at least made Australia sweat today instead of just giving in. Now it\u2019s Chameera picking up a three, as he strides forward and drives hard into the ground and out through cover. Big gap there: three slips, gully, mid off, mid on, leg gully, short leg, fine leg. It nearly carries to the leg gully as Lakmal gloves a pull, but the ball goes finer than that for one. 48th over: Sri Lanka 121-8 (Lakmal 9, Chameera 2) Starc can\u2019t take a trick today. Finally gets an edge, Lakmal going hard at the ball, but it carries over Labuschagne at slip. Starc is frustrated, sprinting in again and letting go. He is bowling heat today, reading 145 for a very short ball. 47th over: Sri Lanka 116-8 (Lakmal 4, Chameera 2) Cummins essays a bouncer, but Chameera is able to evade it. Then nearly squares up the batsman for a leading edge to cover, but Chameera is just in position enough to see the ball head groundwards. It\u2019s a maiden, but Cummins is tiring, his pace down around 137 kph. He\u2019s bowled 14 overs, 8 maidens, 6 for 16. That\u2019s drinks. 46th over: Sri Lanka 116-8 (Lakmal 4, Chameera 2) Starc just can\u2019t get into the action. Attacking the stumps, but Lakmal takes advantage of that by driving a couple through the covers, then squeezing two more past his stumps. Lakmal seems keen to spare Chameera from facing the fastest Australian. 45th over: Sri Lanka 112-8 (Lakmal 0, Chameera 2) If Cummins thought he had a seventh wicket coming, Chameera defuses that by knocking the ball square for two runs, and easing back for two on his sore ankle. End of the over. What. A. Catch. Kurtis Patterson hasn\u2019t had too much to do in this match, but he\u2019s got himself on the highlights reel for now and possibly years to come. Cummins to Perera, and the ball stops a bit in the pitch. The check-drive arrives too soon, and the thick edge lobs a bit over gully. Or it should be over, but Patterson lets loose his moorings and gets airborne. He\u2019s a lanky, plasticine type of human, and he unrolls one long arm. Clasps the ball in one hand, then does an arm-flung swan dive as he descends to earth. Outstanding. Tough resistance from Perera ends, and Cummins equals his career best with six wickets. Has a great chance to go one better. 44th over: Sri Lanka 110-7 (Perera 8, Lakmal 0) Starc from the Vulture Street end. He is still bowling heat, folks, 145.9 then up to 147.2. Perera has handled him pretty competently, though it\u2019s not always comfortable: one crashes into the thigh pad, then after a leg bye Lakmal gets another on the ankle. I\u2019m sporting a lush fig-coloured thigh bruise from last weekend facing a bowler who probably topped out at 55 kilometres an hour, so wearing triple that would be unpleasant no matter how many metres of padding were worn. 43rd over: Sri Lanka 109-7 (Perera 8) The Australians are getting a bit frustrated by this partnership. The umpire signals to Paine to do a bit less talking and a bit more bowling. Richardson does, erupting in an appeal after hitting Dickwella\u2019s pad, but from a right-armer swinging the ball over the wicket into a left-hander, it probably hit the pad outside the line of leg stump and swinging further down. So Richardson bowls outside off, and Dickwella slogs that away through midwicket. That was a proper park shot, leaning and tonking. Dickwella drops to his knees while trying to uppercut the next ball, ending up falling over on his back. Then the last of the over is short outside leg, Dickwella drops his knees to get under it and tries to lift it over fine leg, but he slaps it too low and Head at backward square takes the overhead catch. 42nd over: Sri Lanka 105-6 (Dickwella 20, Perera 8) Mitchell Starc is back, with 0 for 35 from his nine overs. He\u2019s been a bit of a Four N Twenty vendor today. A terrifyingly fast one, but as per a Hilltop Hoods song, \u201call over the shop like bar codes.\u201d He\u2019s getting even faster this over. The scoreboard lights up as he clocks a delivery at 150 kilometres per hour. But Perera calmly dinks it square for two. The deliveries either side of that one are almost as fast. 41st over: Sri Lanka 102-6 (Dickwella 19, Perera 6) Pat Cummins wins some more fans by returning a couple of beach balls to the crowd. Dickwella wins some by uppercutting Richardson over the slips for four. Paine wins some with a brilliant take as Richardson swings one wide of Perera. 40th over: Sri Lanka 97-6 (Dickwella 14, Perera 6) Perera is showing some fight. Gets well in behind another over from Cummins and blocks him out. Word filtering through that Lahiru Kumara has a bad hamstring tear and is out of the series. Probably won\u2019t bat today. Chameera has an ankle problem so I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll bat either. Not much point in either batting, though Australia leg-spinner Kristen Beams on the radio is suggesting that there\u2019s a point to prove if players take any opportunity to front up for their country with the bat. 39th over: Sri Lanka 97-6 (Dickwella 14, Perera 6) Jumping Jhye Richardson comes in for a bowl. Perera glances a single early in the over. Richardson inverts his line to Dickwella, round the wicket to the lefty and hanging the ball wide. Dickwella doesn\u2019t go, until Richardson drops short and the batsman misses another enthusiastic hook. That\u2019s drinks. 38th over: Sri Lanka 96-6 (Dickwella 14, Perera 5) Cummins searching for a sixth. He\u2019s been there twice before in Test cricket: on his debut in 2011 and a couple of weeks ago in Melbourne. Nearly takes Perera\u2019s edge but misses by a micron. Perera taps another single to escape. The more discussion I hear about Thirimanne\u2019s dismissal, the more it sounds like a horrible blunder. The full name for the technology is RTS, standing for Real Time Snicko. Meaning the sound waves and image have to match up. That\u2019s how it works. So for an umpire to suddenly decide that a lag of frames is possible, that throws the validity of all RTS decisions out the window. 37th over: Sri Lanka 95-6 (Dickwella 14, Perera 4) Dilruwan is doing a decent sensible job, knocking a single into the leg side. Dickwella drives a couple through the covers. But by over\u2019s end, he can\u2019t help throwin the bat at Starc, and drags a big edge past his own stumps for four. 36th over: Sri Lanka 88-6 (Dickwella 8, Perera 3) Cummins bowls, through Perera, as one jags a bit off the surface. It beats Paine too for a bye. Dickwella defends a back-of-a-length delivery. Phil Tufnell on ABC Grandstand is discussing Dickwella\u2019s appeals as a wicketkeeper: \u201cHe\u2019s like a little jack-in-the-box. Pops up, both arms out, jazz hands.\u201d Cummins completes a maiden. 35th over: Sri Lanka 87-6 (Dickwella 8, Perera 3) The Battle of the Loose Units here with Dickwella versus Starc. Some wild deliveries, short and leg and off and all over. Some wild shots, hooks and near misses. All of two singles off the over. 34th over: Sri Lanka 85-6 (Dickwella 7, Perera 2) So Cummins has figures of 5 for 11.Dilruwan Perera comes out, the all-rounder whose thumb was smushed by Cummins in the first innings. He\u2019s bravely facing up again. And makes those figures 5 for 13 as he drives a couple square. Then Cummins bowls a wild bouncer that concedes four byes. Five wickets for Cummins! Caught behind. Though the batsman has reviewed this. let\u2019s see... Now this is truly bizarre. There\u2019s nothing on Snicko as the ball passes the bat. Then two frames later there\u2019s a tiny spike. The spike happens just as the ball passes his back elbow as Thirimanne pushed at the ball. So to me it looks like the spike is coming from a clip of the elbow. But third umpire Michael Gough says he\u2019s happy that the lag of two frames is due to the two bits of equipment not being totally synced, and therefore the spike is due to the bat. I\u2019ve never heard that before, and usually we treat Snicko evidence as simultaneous between vision and sound. The decision is upheld and Thirimanne is out. 33rd over: Sri Lanka 79-5 (Thirimanne 32, Dickwella 7) Starc to start up after tea, and he\u2019s operating at decent pace very quickly. Dickwella makes use of that velocity to glance it to fine leg for four. Thanks Adam. The first short break of the day is done, and what will likely be the last stanza of Sri Lankan resistance is about to commence. Though as the West Indies have proved the last couple of days, unfancied teams can still do extraordinary things sometimes. 32nd over: Sri Lanka 74-5 (Thirimanne 31, Dickwella 3) Lyon gets to his mark just before the clock strikes 3pm to see if they can squeeze another wicket out before the break. It\u2019s not to be, despite a couple of close calls. Dickwella was off the mark with a sweep second ball but the same stroke nearly brought him undone next up, nobody where the ball dropped round the corner at short fine. Thirimanne - who is somehow still there, having watched five wickets from the non-strikers\u2019 end - pushes one to point. Dickwella then kept things interesting to the end, missing Lyon\u2019s straight one, but it was missing the woodwork. With that, Sri Lanka reach tea having lost four wickets in the opening stanza, Pat Cummins and Jhye Richardson both magnificent, the former picking up three in a hurry, the latter bending back the off-stump just before the break. I\u2019ll leave you with Geoff from here, the Test, in all likelihood, finishing while he\u2019s on the tools. If that is the case, thanks for your company this week and I\u2019ll talk to you in Canberra! Quite brilliant! Richardson, deserved Dhananjaya\u2019s wicket earlier in the over with a delightful outswinger that missed his edge by a coat of varnish. But to finish, another outswinger beat the bat and crashed into the off-stump. It doesn\u2019t get much better than that for a new fast bowler in his first Test Match. 31st over: Sri Lanka 69-5 (Thirimanne 30) 30th over: Sri Lanka 69-4 (Thirimanne 30, Dhananjaya 14) Unsurprisingly, Lyon is on for a quick pop in the place of Starc before the tea interval. Dhananjaya looks to get forward with the spinner coming over the wicket, so he changes it up mid-over. It nearly works, the batsman not middling a push down the ground, the shout of catch going up when the ball sailed through the vacant midwicket region. 29th over: Sri Lanka 66-4 (Thirimanne 30, Dhananjaya 11) So close! Richardson has been relentless throughout his two spells this afternoon and nearly got the reward, Dhananjaya having a pop at the bouncer, landing just in front of Starc at long leg. That\u2019s twice in two overs that this stroke has nearly brought his demise - time to do as Steve Waugh did and put it away. Perhaps not for a decade as the former Australian captain elected to, but you get my point. 28th over: Sri Lanka 65-4 (Thirimanne 30, Dhananjaya 10) Starc is down the legside twice more, a full toss and a bouncer - a good one, nearly landing with the man at short leg - part of the over as well. Stuart Clark asks Jim Maxwell if he would have him playing in the first Ashes Test. \u201cNot at Edgbaston,\u201d replied the veteran caller. \u201cI\u2019d play someone likely to bowl more consistently with the Dukes ball.\u201d 27th over: Sri Lanka 63-4 (Thirimanne 28, Dhananjaya 10) An exercise in contrast with Starc to Richardson, the latter in the middle of another accurate spell. It prompts a messy attempt from Dhananjaya to pull a bouncer, lucky to miss the ball rather than top edge it. Quite rightly, he defends and leaves the rest. 26th over: Sri Lanka 62-4 (Thirimanne 27, Dhananjaya 10) I said last night that I don\u2019t mind Starc\u2019s volatility, arguing that it doesn\u2019t seem to prevent him taking plenty of wickets. But this is... not pretty. Much as it was in Adelaide, there is no doubt that there will be plenty of scrutiny on this brief spell when this match comes to an end. Of course, an unplayable is in there as well, beating Dhananjaya with one that spits off the turf, leaving the right-hander then beating his edge. But before it was the half-volley and later a half tracker, followed by four byes down the legside and four leg byes off the hip from another wayward offering. \u201cIt\u2019s like a golfer who isn\u2019t putting well,\u201d notes Jim Maxwell on ABC. \u201cEveryone wants to tell you how to fix what you are doing.\u201d 25th over: Sri Lanka 53-4 (Thirimanne 24, Dhananjaya 8) Richardson back for a second spell and he\u2019s right on it, prompting an pleave from Dhananjaya within a couple of balls. The No6 gets his feet moving later in the over, striking a nice drive, but it is cut off at cover. Pulling back his length, the man on debut finds the edge to finish, landing just short of the four catchers behind the wicet. He deserves one. 24th over: Sri Lanka 53-4 (Thirimanne 24, Dhananjaya 8) Starc oversteps to begin, in keeping with the volatile theme from him in this Test, and they take a leg bye after the delivery balloons into the legside off his body. Dhananjaya is leaving then driving, neatly, down the ground for three. He\u2019s in good touch. Singles are then exchanged into the legside before a bumper to finish, ducked by Thirimanne. 23rd over: Sri Lanka 46-4 (Thirimanne 23, Dhananjaya 4) Good footwork from Dhananjaya, taking one to mid-on. Later, Thirimanne also gets a single, albeit off the inside portion of the bat. Lyon isn\u2019t far away when the left-hander is on strike. 22nd over: Sri Lanka 44-4 (Thirimanne 22, Dhananjaya 3) Cummins does get a rest, at the end of a mighty spell: 8-5-11-4. Starc\u2019s turn and he finishes with a beaut to Thirimanne, beaten outside the off stump. Before it, four deliveries were scored from as the left-armer tried to find his mark, Thirimannne clipping three then bumped accurately, Dhananjaya a grabbing couple of singles behind square. 21st over: Sri Lanka 38-4 (Thirimanne 18, Dhananjaya 1) Another maiden for Lyon, his third in five overs so far. Dhananjaya is playing him carefully, starting his innings well. Of course, he has a ton against Australia at Test level from 2016 at Colombo, so he is right to bring a bit of confidence into this series. 20th over: Sri Lanka 38-4 (Thirimanne 18, Dhananjaya 1) Thirimanne gets off the mark first ball of the new Cummins over, albeit for an inside edge but that matters little at this stage. Dhananjaya\u2019s turn, and he\u2019s off the mark first ball, to fine leg too. Thirimanne does the rest of the heavy lifting, managing to avoid the temptation of a couple of balls in his driving arc. Might that be the end of his spell? Meg Lanning is on ABC and she raised the name of Sammy-Jo Johnson, from the victorious Brisbane Heat, as a potential inclusion for Australia when they play the Rose Bowl against New Zealand to finish the summer. If she does make it to the big time, it would be another chapter in what is already a remarkable story. 19th over: Sri Lanka 36-4 (Thirimanne 17, Dhananjaya 0) Lyon continues his battle with Thirimanne but it is very much Off Broadway, the real action right now when Cummins is thundering in. The southpaw retains the strike for that next over, for better or worse, with one to midwicket to finish. A masteful wicket maiden from Cummins, winning Silva\u2019s outside edge with the final delivery with a timid push to Burns at second slip. But it was the earlier work that sorted the No5 out, the Australian quick beating the outside edge, slamming a bumper in that just missed the lid and slipping a yorker past the inside edge, prompting an unsuccessful lbw shout. He has 4/9 from seven overs. Phwoar. 18th over: Sri Lanka 35-4 (Thirimanne 16) 17th over: Sri Lanka 35-3 (Thirimanne 16, Silva 3) Another maiden from Lyon, giving Thirimanne few tempters outside the off stump, surely knowing that the outside edge has been the opener\u2019s primary weakness over the years. 16th over: Sri Lanka 35-3 (Thirimanne 16, Silva 3) Cummins once more, with four clips in position for Silva, who just gets his bat down in time to the first ball, not getting up he was right to expect. But the next delivery in that region, does get up, kissing the thigh pad before racing down to the rope for four leg byes. He keeps it together, defending the last couple, but that volatility will keep him thinking. 15th over: Sri Lanka 31-3 (Thirimanne 16, Silva 3) It doesn\u2019t take Lyon long! Indeed, he has Thirimanne given first ball, lbw! But going through the DRS process, Lyon\u2019s considerable bounce means the delivery is projected to be going over the middle stump by a good six inches. At last, a good review from the visitors. 14th over: Sri Lanka 31-3 (Thirimanne 16, Silva 3) That might be Cummins\u2019 final set for now, going for five runs with the pace slightly down. Understandably so - it\u2019s hot. I\u2019d imagine Starc will now be into the captain, wanting a bowl right away. Ali Mitchell on ABC is discussing an article she read suggesting that the Gabba naming rights could be sold. Tuffers asks how much it is going for, Ali replies $2m AUD a year. \u201cOooh. Only $2m? I might have a dart at that myself! The Tuffers Gabba!\u201d He\u2019s a gem. I\u2019m on the same flight back to London with him after Canberra Test, which could/will be eventful. 13th over: Sri Lanka 26-3 (Thirimanne 11, Silva 3) Nice clip from Thirimanne to start, taking two. Oh, less good from the next, having a lash at a ball well outside the off stump and missing. Put it away! He does, in defence for the rest of the over, keeping the strike with a careful push to square leg. \u201cAdam, do you recall?\u201d tweets Jonathan Northall, picking up what I was putting down with the Pulp reference. \u201cThe lead was very small, Aussies needed wickets to fall. And when Cummins bowled the bal,l Sri Lanka had no answer at all.\u201d I\u2019d\u2019ve also accepted Jarvis\u2019 dramatic allllllllllllll to finish that line. 12th over: Sri Lanka 23-3 (Thirimanne 8, Silva 3) Another rapid over from Cummins, working around that fourth stump line with Silva able to let half the set go, the deliveries taken by Paine at chest or head height. Bringing in the off-cutter to finish, it hit the new man on the thigh pad. Ouch. There is nothing fun about this for the Sri Lankans but they have to find a way to dig in for a few hours. 11th over: Sri Lanka 23-3 (Thirimanne 8, Silva 3) Another maiden for Richardson, who is doing his job perfectly, making Thirimanne play throughout. Then comes the bouncer, which the opener gets underneath just in time. With the new man going so well, this is a very good problem for the selectors to have ahead of the Ashes. How do they all play? How do we shoehorn James Pattinson into the XI? Double-down on strength, I say, and play four quicks and Lyon. Sure, it isn\u2019t conventional, but knocking over England for sod all has to be Play A, B, C and D. 10th over: Sri Lanka 23-3 (Thirimanne 8, Silva 3) Runs off Cummins! Four of them! Three first ball for Silva, clipped off his stumps out to midwicket - nice shot. Thirimanne grabs one behind the square leg umpire. That\u2019s an appalling shot from Mendis, who is way too good to throw his hands at a ball a foot outside the off stump with his side on the ropes. Sure enough, the thick edge lands safely in the hands of Burns at second slip. Cummins now has 3/0 from 13 balls. \u201cWhat dreams are made of,\u201d says Stuart Clark on ABC radio. Not wrong. 9th over: Sri Lanka 19-2 (Thirimanne 7, Mendis 1) Another thing to like about Richardson is that he approaches the crease on a slight angle rather than dead straight, as he has been the convention over the last 20 years or so. Russell Jackson, formerly of this parish, wrote about this a few years back. If Richardson and Worrall both feature in England this year, it would be quite the throwback in this respect. Do it, selectors. Meanwhile, Thirimanne picks up the first run of the day to mid off, Mendis tucking a single himself to get off the mark. 8th over: Sri Lanka 17-2 (Thirimanne 6, Mendis 0) Second up to Mendis, Cummins has the Sri Lankan star playing all around his front pad before then squaring him up a treat, the ball spitting out to the gully on the bounce. It makes another wicket maiden for Cummins, his current analysis 2-2-0-2. Whoa. A second ball blob for the skipper! Cummins is on fire, just as he was last night, winning the edge from a delivery that took off from a length, ballooning into the gully. Patterson did the rest in the gully, having to jump to reach the catch, doing it well. 7th over: Sri Lanka 17-1 (Thirimanne 6, Chandimal 0) A tidy maiden to begin Richardson\u2019s day, immediately in the channel then finding Thirimanne\u2019s edge, albeit into the gully on the bounce. He\u2019s a very impressive starter. The players are out in the middle for an Indigenous welcome followed by the national anthem before the resumption. Some good words from CA spokesman James Sherry, noting the organisation\u2019s support for the ongoing reconciliation project, \u201cnot to deny our past but for it to shape our future.\u201d Thirimanne is joined by Chandimal, having lost Karunaratne from the final ball last night. Richardson has the ball in his hand, coming from the Stanley Street End. PLAY! The pitch. Looks to be plenty still there, especially for Jhye Richardson who has won plenty of lateral movement so far in this Test Match. Blimey, have we all caught the Justin Langer profile in Good Weekend? I\u2019ll leave this passage to speak for itself. A press box colleague in response: \u201cAccidental Partridge?\u201d Indeed. Having watched the end of the WBBL, the teams are now warming up. Happy as Justin Langer would be that his side are on the cusp of a one-nil series lead, he\u2019ll also, surely, be smiling about England\u2019s, um, issues over the last 36 hours. Check out Vic Marks\u2019 match report from Kensington, following Jason Holder\u2019s masterful double ton. What a cricketer the Windies captain has matured into. THE HEAT WIN! Wonderful scenes, Brisbane over the line for their first Big Bash title with a Laura Harris boundary with a few balls to go. Beth Mooney is the hero with her 65. All eyes on the big screen at the Gabba. As it is about 10 seconds ahead of the telly. Both teams have stopped to watch - magnificent. That\u2019s the big benefit of the WBBL being televised from the get-go, this buy in from the entire cricket community. JP is on the OBO for that final, I should add. Where the mighty Teen Wolv, Laura Wolvaardt, has been run out by her South African teammate Marizanne Kapp the ball after belting her national captain, Dane van Niekerk, for four. Six off seven needed! What a finish! It has been a hot and windy morning in the Queensland capital, real sweat-through-your-shirt stuff, which is exactly as I\u2019ve done on the way up to the press box. We return for day three with the hosts 162 runs ahead, Sri Lanka 17-1 overnight having lost Karunaratne from the final ball last night. Pat Cummins, what a moment, what a dreamboat. Australia in three days? Don\u2019t doubt it. I\u2019ll turn my attention to the pre-play build up as soon as this WBBL final has concluded. At Drummoyne, Brisbane require 15 from 12 with four wickets in hand. Having covered this competition closely since its inception, make no mistake, this will not be easy. I\u2019m backing the Suuuuper Over. If the Sixers do find a way to defend these runs, they will claim a hat-trick of titles. Pop on the telly!",

So what have we learned from their week in the snow?</p> <h2>1 Davos has lost its mojo</h2> <p>Love him or hate him, Donald Trump created a buzz at the 2018 annual meeting, but this year the atmosphere was flat. Ken Rogoff, a Harvard economics professor and Davos regular, said he could not recall the mood being so muted. Without Trump, Xi Jinping of China or Vladimir Putin, Davos lacked a headline act.

The Duke of Cambridge revealed he hadn\u2019t been able to get any celebrities to sign up to help launch the Heads Together campaign fronted by him, his wife and his brother. He criticised the British stiff-upper-lip approach of the wartime generation, and said it was partly to blame for the stigma around mental health problems.</p> <h2>3 Climate change is unavoidable but have delegates really got the message?</h2> <p>Delegates who took the trip up Davos\u2019s funicular railway met Arctic scientists warning of a climate change catastrophe unless urgent action is taken to \u201cbend the curve\u201d on rising greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>Phasing out burning coal would be a good start, but environmentalists were disappointed when Angela Merkel said Germany would need coal for \u201ca certain time\u201d (and more Russian gas otherwise).</p> <p>Davos, meanwhile, was gridlocked with limos all week, suggesting that CEOs need to walk the walk as well as talk the talk.

There are years, such as 2007, when they are insufferably bullish. And there are years in between, such as this one. There was concern about the recent weakness of the global economy \u2013 but not that much. If a recession is in the offing, Davos has not realised it yet.</p> <h2>5 Growing concern about Brexit</h2> <p>Philip Hammond stood in for Theresa May this year and the chancellor had a series of meetings with business chiefs and policymakers in an attempt to reassure them that the government was doing its utmost to avoid a no-deal Brexit on 29 March. He would have needed a tin ear not to have picked up on the growing business worries.</p> <p>His key message was that the vote to leave had to be respected \u2013 but that a no-deal Brexit would be a betrayal of the hopes for a better future of those who voted leave.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e0aaea299f3263470eeb828f3191cde5cadaf240\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0aaea299f3263470eeb828f3191cde5cadaf240/0_3_652_367/500.png\" alt=\"People wearing Zurich Insurance\u2019s blue bobble hats at Davos\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zurich Insurance\u2019s blue bobble hat giveaway proved a hit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @Zurichinsurance/Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6 The Davos bobble hat</h2> <p>Even the global elite like a freebie, and few giveaways are more popular than the blue Davos bobble hats, sponsored by Zurich Insurance, and available from a special hole-in-the-wall bobble dispenser outside the conference centre.</p> <p>So much more than a mere beanie, they have a discreet logo which can advertise the wearer\u2019s importance on the school run or a family ski holiday.

The broadcaster Sir David Attenborough (a sprightly 92) and climate activist Greta Thunberg (a resolute 16) both used the forum\u2019s spotlight to promote climate activism (and in Sir David\u2019s case his new Netflix documentary too). Prince William and the New Zealand PM, Jacinda Ardern, were a hot ticket and there was an unseemly scramble to get into their discussion session on mental health. The Duke of Cambridge revealed he hadn\u2019t been able to get any celebrities to sign up to help launch the Heads Together campaign fronted by him, his wife and his brother. He criticised the British stiff-upper-lip approach of the wartime generation, and said it was partly to blame for the stigma around mental health problems. 3 Climate change is unavoidable but have delegates really got the message? Delegates who took the trip up Davos\u2019s funicular railway met Arctic scientists warning of a climate change catastrophe unless urgent action is taken to \u201cbend the curve\u201d on rising greenhouse gas emissions. Phasing out burning coal would be a good start, but environmentalists were disappointed when Angela Merkel said Germany would need coal for \u201ca certain time\u201d (and more Russian gas otherwise). Davos, meanwhile, was gridlocked with limos all week, suggesting that CEOs need to walk the walk as well as talk the talk. Or, indeed, just walk. 4 Unease about the global economy Davos has three settings. There are years, such as 2009, when the attendees are panic-stricken. There are years, such as 2007, when they are insufferably bullish. And there are years in between, such as this one.

He would have needed a tin ear not to have picked up on the growing business worries. His key message was that the vote to leave had to be respected \u2013 but that a no-deal Brexit would be a betrayal of the hopes for a better future of those who voted leave. 6 The Davos bobble hat Even the global elite like a freebie, and few giveaways are more popular than the blue Davos bobble hats, sponsored by Zurich Insurance, and available from a special hole-in-the-wall bobble dispenser outside the conference centre. So much more than a mere beanie, they have a discreet logo which can advertise the wearer\u2019s importance on the school run or a family ski holiday. Hundreds are handed out every year and by Thursday they had to post a sign saying they\u2019d run out \u2013 but to come back next year. 7 Nobody likes Davos While everyone who\u2019s anyone is expected to be at Davos, few seem to really enjoy it, and the four days can be a slog.

Yet British authorities, social workers and some NGOs appear to be unaware or in denial that the practice exists in the UK and are not taking a proactive approach to find or even keep track of the cases. Police say the obvious problem is that children are unlikely to report their parents, and few other people will ever get to know it is going on. \u201cWhat we wouldn\u2019t expect is a victim to necessarily walk into a police station and report what is happening to them,\u201d says Allen Davis, the Metropolitan police\u2019s lead on illegal culture practice. \u201cIf people were to tell us where it\u2019s happening, when, to whom and by whom \u2013 then we will do something about it.\u201d \u201cLike FGM, cultural practices that harm children or adults are complex issues to solve,\u201d says Jess Phillips, the MP for Birmingham Yardley. \u201cHowever, we must do all we can to educate communities against the practices and seek to prosecute perpetrators and protect victims.\u201d Maureen says that having had her own breast ironed when she was a child in Cameroon, she became convinced this would help her protect her own daughter from harm, especially when she noticed her beginning to develop. \u201cThe area where we were living \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a good area,\u201d she says, describing youth gangs walking the streets, fighting and peddling cannabis. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let her play outside. \u201cWhen you saw her, you couldn\u2019t see the baby in her \u2013 you just saw a teenager. So for me it was really a nightmare.\u201d Maureen called her mother in Cameroon, who guided her through the process. \u201cSome women say that they do [it] because these girls \u2026 are prone to rape,\u201d says Mary*, a local community activist in south London. \u201cWe have chat groups most weeks and women have talked about breast-ironing,\u201d says Karyne Tazi, the executive director of the Women &amp; Families Resource Centre in Wolverhampton, who works to educate women on the risks of the practice. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about it like a vaccine: \u2018It\u2019s painful but it helps,\u2019\u201d says Tazi, adding that the practice has serious physical, psychological and overall health effects that many people are simply not aware about. Jennifer Miraj, a nurse, recalls seeing dozens of cases of women and girls who had been breast-ironed while she worked in hospitals around the UK. She says she saw \u201cwomen who couldn\u2019t breastfeed and had long-term issues with cysts and infections from the milk ducts not being able to express the little milk they were producing\u201d. She says many women had \u201cpainful red infections and no opportunity to bond [with the baby] by breastfeeding\u201d, and that it was common for women who had been breast-ironed to be diagnosed with breast cancer. Cathy Aba Fouda, who was subjected to breast-ironing in Cameroon, where the practice is thought to originate, also says that there have been cases of women who had been breast-ironed developing breast cancer. \u201cWe lost a young woman only last month who had been breast-ironed as a girl and died from breast cancer, aged just 24,\u201d says Fouda. \u201cI don\u2019t know why no one has done a study on the link between the two.\u201d Psychological problems are also very common following breast-ironing and can last for years, according to Fouda. \u201cWhen I had a baby, all the trauma came flooding back,\u201d she says, explaining that whenever the child reached for her chest, she felt panic like someone was about to hurt her. Yet some UK-based community activists appear to be unaware of the risks. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any research which said that breast-ironing is bad,\u201d says Mary, adding that some women say it improves the mother-daughter bond. \u201cUp to now I haven\u2019t heard that it\u2019s related to cancer.\u201d \u201cThe only thing is that the nipple sort of goes into inverse, and it makes it very difficult if you have to breastfeed.\u201d\u201cFGM, breast-ironing \u2013 it fundamentally comes back to the control over women\u2019s bodies,\u201d says the anti-FGM activist Leyla Hussein, who also provides therapy to breast-ironing survivors. \u201cThe whole community needs an education,\u201d says Mary Stella in Wolverhampton. \u201cBecause we are coming from a background where we think it\u2019s OK.\u201d Nazir Afzal, a former chief prosecutor for north-west England, says that introducing a specific law against breast-ironing could help, citing a similar experience with the criminalisation of forced marriage. \u201cSometimes you need to change a law to send out a message,\u201d he says. But others believe this would spell disaster and would push the practice even further underground. \u201cLook at FGM: from 1985 till now they are still looking for somebody to prosecute \u2013 is that not ridiculous?\u201d says Mary. \u201cGoing around in a sympathetic way saying: \u2018Do you know anyone undergoing this?\u2019 so that they can latch on to that child like a tonne of bricks \u2013 that\u2019s not support, is it?\u201d Tazi says interventions need to be subtle. \u201cMore organisations need to have the resources and opportunities to get these communities to talk. Because if they don\u2019t talk, it will always be an underground crime \u2026 But the more people talk about it, the more we\u2019ll find solutions. \u201cWhen we first started, you hold a chat group on breast-ironing and labia pulling and no one would turn up. But they\u2019ve seen us: we\u2019re there, we\u2019re constant, we try to work with them around it, not criminalise them. And they\u2019re now more open to talking,\u201d says Tazi. In Maureen\u2019s case, her daughter was held by social services for 10 days before being released back to her family. Maureen faced no criminal charges, only a police caution. \u201cA social worker would come around once a week for one or two months, that\u2019s all. After then, they just dropped the case,\u201d she says. Maureen moved her daughter to another school. \u201cIf I knew the laws of this country, I should\u2019ve kept my daughter at home for three days [instead of sending her to school],\u201d she says, slapping her hands together in frustration. \u201cUntil that bruise just went away. They [would] never have known.\u201d * Name changed",

Williams was playing Heather Watson, a young British player, who took the match to three sets before losing. \u201cThe tighter the game, the more emotion Serena shows, and she was shouting quite a bit \u2013 partly from frustration, but partly to encourage herself to play better.\u201d But in every game there are moments of calm focus. \u201cHere, she looks so serene, just before a powerful smash. Centre Court is beautiful at this time of day, as the sun sets. The players appear lit up, the light falling on their faces.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI love photographing athletes with strong personalities, as they produce pictures other players don\u2019t,\u201d says Tom Jenkins. \u201cSerena is wonderful: much of the time she obliterates her opponents with her power, but the more interesting matches to photograph are where she is forced to move around.\u201d This was one of those: the third round at Wimbledon, on 3 July 2015. Williams was playing Heather Watson, a young British player, who took the match to three sets before losing. \u201cThe tighter the game, the more emotion Serena shows, and she was shouting quite a bit \u2013 partly from frustration, but partly to encourage herself to play better.\u201d But in every game there are moments of calm focus. \u201cHere, she looks so serene, just before a powerful smash. Centre Court is beautiful at this time of day, as the sun sets. The players appear lit up, the light falling on their faces. You can\u2019t take your eyes off Serena: she\u2019s so beautiful, and you never know what she\u2019s going to do next.\u201d Hannah Booth Buy your exclusive print here Price \u00a350, including free delivery Prints Photographs are 30x40cm and presented on museum-grade, fine-art paper stocks, with archival standards guaranteeing quality for 100+ years.

      "body": "<p>The world may be crashing down around our ears but, as we wait out the apocalypse, one thing is clear: we will not be short of good telly. Subscription services are booming, budgets have skyrocketed and, with more original shows on offer than ever, viewers need never leave the house again. While on-demand TV and box-set bingeing means we each create our own schedules, TV dramas have nonetheless yielded genuine \u201cwatercooler\u201d moments, albeit with the chatter happening on social media rather than at work. Will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/18/best-tv-shows-2018-bodyguard\">Bodyguard\u2019s</a> PC Budd ever crack a smile? Is it possible for Luther to open a door instead of kicking it in? We need answers, preferably from strangers on the internet. So how on earth did we get here?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same story with TV as with everything else: the internet came along and provided access to more content,\u201d says Piers Wenger, controller of BBC drama. \u201cThe age of digital platforms and on-demand content has led to a global market for English-language television. But it\u2019s in the last five or six years that it\u2019s really started to pop, which means massive amounts of money coming into the UK drama sector. And the audiences are vast.\u201d</p> <p>The figures are indeed mind-boggling. In the final quarter of 2018, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/15/netflix-prices-cost-rise-subscription-film-tv-streaming\">Netflix</a> reached 139 million subscribers worldwide. Meanwhile, the BBC \u2013 David to Netflix\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/14/goliath-review-billy-bob-thornton-legal-drama-amazon\">Goliath</a> in budgetary terms \u2013 has enjoyed startling success in the past year, with Bodyguard and Killing Eve reaching 43m requests each on iPlayer (Bodyguard also became the most-watched drama since 2006, with 17.1m people tuning into the series finale. In a peculiar turn of events, these marquee dramas have also been largely loved by the critics, which either means that critical standards have dropped or TV is getting better.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e319457c3e6c24954610510ac4dcca19e0e97cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e319457c3e6c24954610510ac4dcca19e0e97cc/0_0_3500_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Madden and Keeley Hawes in Bodyguard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Madden and Keeley Hawes in Bodyguard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lisa McGee, writer of the Channel 4 comedy-drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/13/derry-girls-instant-sitcom-classic-schoolgirls-northern-ireland\">Derry Girls</a>, reckons it is the latter. \u201cThe scale of storytelling has broadened, as has its ambition,\u201d she says. \u201cI like to write for TV because I like spending a lot of time with characters; you can do a lot in 20 hours. It\u2019s doing what novels did 100 years ago. When I began writing 10 or 11 years ago, it was very different. Stories had to be episodic and have a theme. It was very formulaic. Now anything goes. No one\u2019s afraid of the audience not understanding.\u201d</p> <p>The writer David Nicholls, who adapted the addiction drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/13/patrick-melrose-review-brilliant-portrayal-addiction-benedict-cumberbatch\">Patrick Melrose</a> for Sky Atlantic, agrees: \u201cThere\u2019s a wider range of tones and voices, and riskier shows are making it to the screen. With Patrick Melrose, no one ever said: \u2018This is too tough for our audience\u2019, or that he ought to be more likeable, or that we should take out the darker stuff. And that was great.\u201d</p> <p>To understand TV\u2019s current purple patch, McGee says, you have to go back 20 years to the arrival of HBO\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/08/the-sopranos-10-years-since-it-finished-its-still-the-most-masterful-show-ever\">The Sopranos</a>. It was, she says, a \u201cgame-changer, a show that assumed in its audience intelligence and sophistication\u201d. More critically acclaimed HBO series followed including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/mar/25/my-favourite-tv-six-feet-under\">Six Feet Under</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/03/curb-your-enthusiasm-review-if-it-aint-woke-dont-fix-it\">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>, The Wire and, later, Game of Thrones, along with hit shows from other networks \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jul/03/when-good-tv-goes-bad-west-wing\">The West Wing</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/29/mad-men-box-set-review\">Mad Men</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/20/breaking-bad-10-years-on-tv-is-still-in-walter-whites-shadow\">Breaking Bad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/11/eight-years-after-it-finished-why-is-lost-being-reappraised\">Lost</a> \u2013 all of which slotted comfortably into the 00s DVD box-set era and the growing appetite for binge-watching. If HBO showed what could be achieved through a succession of ambitious and generously funded shows, Netflix opened the floodgates through its consumer-friendly approach, upping the ante by allowing viewers to watch at their own pace and on whatever device they had to hand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7889fca13a88183f5f1eaf2c0bfa3f3b96bd7373\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7889fca13a88183f5f1eaf2c0bfa3f3b96bd7373/0_0_2079_1355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cast of The Wire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cast of The Wire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, consumer demand has led to an era of feverish commissioning and eye-watering budgets across the networks. According to the Economist, Netflix splashed out $13bn on content in 2018, with the majority going on new commissions. While Wenger won\u2019t be drawn on BBC drama\u2019s financial outgoings, he says that budgets have increased sufficiently that \u201cwe can play in genres that we couldn\u2019t have done justice to in the past\u201d.</p> <p>All of which is great news for actors. \u201cI\u2019ve never been as busy as I am now,\u201d says Daniel Mays, star of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/18/the-50-best-tv-shows-of-2017-no-2-line-of-duty\">Line of Duty</a>, Born to Kill and the forthcoming Sky One drama Temple. \u201cNow you can really take the audience on a journey. Temple will be eight episodes at an hour long each. It gives us an incredible platform and the range to dig deep. Plus, the crossover among actors from film to TV is massive. When you\u2019re working with actors of that calibre, it really raises your game.\u201d</p> <p>Certainly, television is increasingly the place to be for Hollywood actors. In the era of \u201csafe\u201d cinema franchises, from Marvel and DC to Star Wars and Bourne, there is a sense that greater variety and experimentation can be found on TV. Older women in particular are finding meatier roles on the small screen: think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/27/julia-roberts-homecoming\">Julia Roberts</a> in Homecoming, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jul/15/stranger-things-review-a-shot-of-80s-nostalgia-right-to-your-heart-winona-ryder\">Winona Ryder in Stranger Things</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/17/big-little-lies-nicole-kidman-and-reese-witherspoon-shine-in-masterful-twist-on-desperate-housewives\">Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon in Big Little Lies</a>. Nicholls has observed this blurring of the boundaries between TV and film. \u201cAs a writer, I no longer have to put on my TV hat,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting there\u2019s money to burn but there are things you can do now. You used to have to consciously limit your locations, or avoid scenes with large numbers of people, as these were tricky to implement. There was a kind of chamber quality to a lot of British TV, much of it wonderful, but now if you watch a prestige show like Peaky Blinders, it\u2019s very cinematic.\u201d</p> <p>While this increased ambition and scale is understandably seductive to writers and actors, what about the viewers? With a near-constant stream of new shows being flagged up, the choice can be overwhelming.

      "bodyText": "The world may be crashing down around our ears but, as we wait out the apocalypse, one thing is clear: we will not be short of good telly. Subscription services are booming, budgets have skyrocketed and, with more original shows on offer than ever, viewers need never leave the house again. While on-demand TV and box-set bingeing means we each create our own schedules, TV dramas have nonetheless yielded genuine \u201cwatercooler\u201d moments, albeit with the chatter happening on social media rather than at work. Will Bodyguard\u2019s PC Budd ever crack a smile? Is it possible for Luther to open a door instead of kicking it in? We need answers, preferably from strangers on the internet. So how on earth did we get here? \u201cIt\u2019s the same story with TV as with everything else: the internet came along and provided access to more content,\u201d says Piers Wenger, controller of BBC drama. \u201cThe age of digital platforms and on-demand content has led to a global market for English-language television. But it\u2019s in the last five or six years that it\u2019s really started to pop, which means massive amounts of money coming into the UK drama sector. And the audiences are vast.\u201d The figures are indeed mind-boggling. In the final quarter of 2018, Netflix reached 139 million subscribers worldwide. Meanwhile, the BBC \u2013 David to Netflix\u2019s Goliath in budgetary terms \u2013 has enjoyed startling success in the past year, with Bodyguard and Killing Eve reaching 43m requests each on iPlayer (Bodyguard also became the most-watched drama since 2006, with 17.1m people tuning into the series finale. In a peculiar turn of events, these marquee dramas have also been largely loved by the critics, which either means that critical standards have dropped or TV is getting better. Lisa McGee, writer of the Channel 4 comedy-drama Derry Girls, reckons it is the latter. \u201cThe scale of storytelling has broadened, as has its ambition,\u201d she says. \u201cI like to write for TV because I like spending a lot of time with characters; you can do a lot in 20 hours. It\u2019s doing what novels did 100 years ago. When I began writing 10 or 11 years ago, it was very different. Stories had to be episodic and have a theme. It was very formulaic. Now anything goes. No one\u2019s afraid of the audience not understanding.\u201d The writer David Nicholls, who adapted the addiction drama Patrick Melrose for Sky Atlantic, agrees: \u201cThere\u2019s a wider range of tones and voices, and riskier shows are making it to the screen. With Patrick Melrose, no one ever said: \u2018This is too tough for our audience\u2019, or that he ought to be more likeable, or that we should take out the darker stuff. And that was great.\u201d To understand TV\u2019s current purple patch, McGee says, you have to go back 20 years to the arrival of HBO\u2019s The Sopranos. It was, she says, a \u201cgame-changer, a show that assumed in its audience intelligence and sophistication\u201d. More critically acclaimed HBO series followed including Six Feet Under, Curb Your Enthusiasm, The Wire and, later, Game of Thrones, along with hit shows from other networks \u2013 The West Wing, Mad Men, Breaking Bad, Lost \u2013 all of which slotted comfortably into the 00s DVD box-set era and the growing appetite for binge-watching. If HBO showed what could be achieved through a succession of ambitious and generously funded shows, Netflix opened the floodgates through its consumer-friendly approach, upping the ante by allowing viewers to watch at their own pace and on whatever device they had to hand. Now, consumer demand has led to an era of feverish commissioning and eye-watering budgets across the networks. According to the Economist, Netflix splashed out $13bn on content in 2018, with the majority going on new commissions. While Wenger won\u2019t be drawn on BBC drama\u2019s financial outgoings, he says that budgets have increased sufficiently that \u201cwe can play in genres that we couldn\u2019t have done justice to in the past\u201d. All of which is great news for actors. \u201cI\u2019ve never been as busy as I am now,\u201d says Daniel Mays, star of Line of Duty, Born to Kill and the forthcoming Sky One drama Temple. \u201cNow you can really take the audience on a journey. Temple will be eight episodes at an hour long each. It gives us an incredible platform and the range to dig deep. Plus, the crossover among actors from film to TV is massive. When you\u2019re working with actors of that calibre, it really raises your game.\u201d Certainly, television is increasingly the place to be for Hollywood actors. In the era of \u201csafe\u201d cinema franchises, from Marvel and DC to Star Wars and Bourne, there is a sense that greater variety and experimentation can be found on TV. Older women in particular are finding meatier roles on the small screen: think Julia Roberts in Homecoming, Winona Ryder in Stranger Things and Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon in Big Little Lies. Nicholls has observed this blurring of the boundaries between TV and film. \u201cAs a writer, I no longer have to put on my TV hat,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting there\u2019s money to burn but there are things you can do now. You used to have to consciously limit your locations, or avoid scenes with large numbers of people, as these were tricky to implement. There was a kind of chamber quality to a lot of British TV, much of it wonderful, but now if you watch a prestige show like Peaky Blinders, it\u2019s very cinematic.\u201d While this increased ambition and scale is understandably seductive to writers and actors, what about the viewers? With a near-constant stream of new shows being flagged up, the choice can be overwhelming. And just because a show looks pretty and has set tongues wagging doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s any good. \u201cStarting something new definitely requires a level of commitment,\u201d reflects Mays. \u201cIt can become this mountain to climb. We\u2019re awash with content, so the worry is whether or not the production you\u2019re working on can make an impact. It\u2019s a fierce marketplace and the competition is stiff. Finding the audience seems to me to be the final hurdle.\u201d Clearly there are greater challenges ahead. While Netflix continues to pile on subscribers, the rate of growth has started to slow; a price increase was recently announced for US viewers.

      "bodyText": "It is Saturday morning, and I am in the butcher\u2019s, waiting my turn. The couple in front of me cannot decide between pheasant and partridge, which is fine with me, because I don\u2019t know what I want, either. I\u2019m in no hurry. I\u2019m perfectly happy standing here, listening to smooth rock. The couple decide on pheasant, but they aren\u2019t sure if they need one or two. It\u2019s nice that they go to the butcher together, I think, instead of one of them, with no plan or instructions or ideas. After some deliberation the couple decide to take two pheasants. A brace, the man says. \u201cA brace,\u201d the butcher says. \u201cI\u2019ve only just learned what a brace means.\u201d \u201cTwo,\u201d the man says. \u201cYeah, but a brace means a male and a female,\u201d the butcher says. \u201cDoes it?\u201d the man says. His voice carries a slight ring of suspicion, which I decide is warranted. Could it really mean that? It seems weirdly and unnecessarily specific. Then again, it\u2019s not the sort of thing you would lie to your butcher about for sport. I suddenly feel resentful and out of my depth, as if this fact had been deliberately withheld from me for class reasons. \u201cYeah, a male and a female,\u201d the butcher says. \u201cCan you even tell when they\u2019re like this?\u201d the man says, pointing to the two pheasants behind the glass, plucked, dressed and identical. Good point, I say to myself, nodding at the floor. \u201cThey\u2019re different sizes,\u201d the butcher says, defiantly.

I slip my phone from my pocket and start to type \u201cBrace pheasant male\u2026\u201d But then I stop and think: this isn\u2019t your fight.

She was clear in her judgments and certain in her encouragement. We first met in the early 1980s, when a book I was allegedly writing for her publishing firm, Andr\u00e9 Deutsch, had long passed its delivery date. I took the work-in-no-progress to the office, where Diana read some of the first chapter aloud with such elegant enunciation that I was almost (though not quite) persuaded to carry on with the rest. At that time I didn\u2019t know she\u2019d been a writer, but then I read her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/05/fiction\" title=\"\">two books of memoir</a>, Instead of a Letter and After a Funeral, and was struck, as many others have been, by her frankness and clarity and the wonderful rhythm of her prose.</p> \n<p>Then our roles changed. At Granta, I was the editor and she was the writer. Via a mutual acquaintance, she sent in a piece for the magazine about her professional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/sep/16/classics\" title=\"\">friendship with Jean Rhys</a>. I didn\u2019t think the piece was our kind of thing \u2013 I was a wrong about this \u2013 but she mentioned it had been taken from a book she was writing. I asked to see the whole typescript of the book, which turned out to be Stet. She was 82 and about to embark on her Indian summer as a writer. Several other books and a magazine piece or two followed, and we republished her backlist. Very little editing was ever required. I can truthfully say that I could begin reading at any point on one of her typed pages and never want to stop, impelled through sentence after sentence by the delightful force of her narration, as though she was speaking to me.</p> \n<p>Very occasionally, I suggested a change. There was too much sex, I thought, at the beginning of what turned out to be her most successful book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/12/biography\" title=\"\">Somewhere Towards the End</a>. That seemed an odd thing to say to a writer who was then close to 90, but I thought we didn\u2019t need as many pages to establish the author\u2019s pleasure in sex as a mechanical rather than psychological or emotional activity; an activity that in any case had left Diana behind. Diana agreed and the book was adjusted. My second suggestion had more interesting results.</p> \n<p>I wondered to Diana if, towards the book\u2019s close, her tone sounded too complacent. \u201cLet me have a think,\u201d she said, and soon after submitted a new passage that began: \u201cNot long ago a friend said to me that I ought to be careful not to sound complacent, \u2018because\u2019 he added kindly, \u2018you are not\u2019.\u201d She disagreed with her anonymous friend (I guessed it was me). She declared she <em>was</em> complacent. She had started out, she wrote, \u201cwrapped warmly in my family\u2019s belief that we were the best kind of people short of saintliness: a belief common in the upper levels of the English middle class and confirmed by pride in being English\u201d. And though that \u201ctribal smugness\u201d and \u201cwicked nonsense\u201d had been smashed when her first and most important lover jilted her, self-satisfaction of another kind had returned with her late success. If this was smugness, and she couldn\u2019t help feeling that it was, then she had to report that \u201cthough repulsive to witness, it is a far more comfortable state <em>to be in</em> than its opposite\u201d.</p> \n<p>So she was happy to be smug \u2013 you might say smug about it \u2013 because comfort was what one needed on the \u201cdownhill journey\u201d of advanced old age. Disguised in her attractive and thoughtful sentences, there was sometimes the brisk approach of a governess who wants to settle her brood\u2019s every question by being sensible. What was sex? What was death? What was the point of moping after the first or fearing the second? She knew her nature \u2013 she confessed to a \u201cnub of coldness\u201d at her centre \u2013 but it still gave me a jolt when in conversation she might scoff (\u201cRidiculous!\u201d) at the memory of a dying old man crying with fear in his hospital bed or other evidence of irrational human behaviour. She could be tough. You didn\u2019t want her to think of you as \u201csentimental\u201d or your writing as \u201csaccharine\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e9ea22a0-3eb7-452a-a0a6-9cee05379f0a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4-20VOVTol0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Though she was a partner in a publishing firm, and often rightly described as one of London\u2019s best book editors, she never made much money. She lived in a flat rented from a cousin, the Economist journalist Barbara Smith, at the top of Smith\u2019s house in Primrose Hill, and drove a small car. We paid mean advances for her books, and the approach of dependent old age loomed without the benefit of children or a big bank balance. But Somewhere Towards the End won a prize and became a bestseller. Diana could scarcely believe it: a book about being old was going to make it easier for her to be old. She had discovered a retirement home that was \u201castonishingly acceptable\u201d, and with her new income she could afford to move in. As she wrote to me, it was \u201cBye-bye geriatric ward!!!\u201d And it was.</p> \n<p>I went to see her on Wednesday at a hospice in Belsize Park. Her final room \u2013 there she lay, aged 101, head back on the pillow and mouth open in a frozen yawn. Her silver hair had thinned but her skin was as clear as ever. We drew chairs to the bedside and talked, as people surrounding the apparently unconscious tend to do, hoping that she could hear even if she couldn\u2019t speak. The talk was about her. Her nephew Phil remembered that she\u2019d got frustrated with the lack of attention during a recent hospital visit and, unusually for her, pulled rank. \u201cI write for the Guardian, you know,\u201d she had said.</p> \n<p>She breathed on. I took her hand briefly, and then Pru Rowlandson from Granta took it for the rest of her life. Diana made three or four sounds in her throat, and her eyes opened a little. Her breathing paused. Pru said her hand was cold. Dead or alive? It was hard to be sure, for a few minutes, and then it was certain. Phil closed her eyes.</p> \n<p>Diana always remembered that her mother\u2019s last words, having been asked about a visit to a nursery garden in Norfolk, were: \u201cIt was absolutely divine.\u201d She hoped she would end her days with something similar in her mind\u2019s eye. And it seemed that she had. It was the most serene transition: a small bird would have made more fuss.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Ian Jack is a Guardian columnist</p>",

She lived in a flat rented from a cousin, the Economist journalist Barbara Smith, at the top of Smith\u2019s house in Primrose Hill, and drove a small car. We paid mean advances for her books, and the approach of dependent old age loomed without the benefit of children or a big bank balance. But Somewhere Towards the End won a prize and became a bestseller. Diana could scarcely believe it: a book about being old was going to make it easier for her to be old. She had discovered a retirement home that was \u201castonishingly acceptable\u201d, and with her new income she could afford to move in. As she wrote to me, it was \u201cBye-bye geriatric ward!!!\u201d And it was. I went to see her on Wednesday at a hospice in Belsize Park. Her final room \u2013 there she lay, aged 101, head back on the pillow and mouth open in a frozen yawn. Her silver hair had thinned but her skin was as clear as ever. We drew chairs to the bedside and talked, as people surrounding the apparently unconscious tend to do, hoping that she could hear even if she couldn\u2019t speak. The talk was about her. Her nephew Phil remembered that she\u2019d got frustrated with the lack of attention during a recent hospital visit and, unusually for her, pulled rank. \u201cI write for the Guardian, you know,\u201d she had said. She breathed on. I took her hand briefly, and then Pru Rowlandson from Granta took it for the rest of her life. Diana made three or four sounds in her throat, and her eyes opened a little. Her breathing paused. Pru said her hand was cold. Dead or alive? It was hard to be sure, for a few minutes, and then it was certain. Phil closed her eyes. Diana always remembered that her mother\u2019s last words, having been asked about a visit to a nursery garden in Norfolk, were: \u201cIt was absolutely divine.\u201d She hoped she would end her days with something similar in her mind\u2019s eye. And it seemed that she had. It was the most serene transition: a small bird would have made more fuss. \u2022 Ian Jack is a Guardian columnist",

One is \u201cbased on\u201d Queen Anne\u2019s relations with her two ladies-in-waiting, the other on Mary\u2019s relations with Elizabeth I, complete with an invented meeting between them. Both are modernised tales of feminine machismo, their (female) actors speaking today\u2019s foul-mouthed English and treating the male actors as toxic cartoons. The director of The Favourite, Yorgos Lanthimos, remarked casually that \u201csome of the things in the film are accurate and a lot aren\u2019t\u201d. What is a history student to make of that?</p> <p>I am sure the distant past can look after itself. Peddlers of fake history always cite Shakespeare\u2019s Richard III as their template. We should note that it took three centuries for historians to rescue Richard from that hatchet job. We might now ask how long it will take poor, dignified Queen Anne to recover from The Favourite \u2013 or can we rely on television\u2019s admirable fib-chaser Lucy Worsley to do it first?</p> <p>Historical bias is potent. Churchill remarked that history would be kind to him \u201cas I intend to write it myself\u201d. He did, and it was. The most disgraced interwar politician emerged as a saintly hero, single-handed slayer of the demon Hitler. He has remained so ever since. The embellishments in Darkest Hour would have done credit to Russia\u2019s Mosfilm or Mao\u2019s China.</p> <p>More alarming is the appeal of current affairs to ratings-hungry producers. The stories of the British royal family, Dick Cheney, Brexit and \u2013 soon, we can be sure \u2013 Donald Trump have immediacy and relevance. They pander to the (mostly leftwing) biases of actors and directors, with invention excused as \u201cartistic licence\u201d. I recall the reply when I chided a director about his fabricating a scene. \u201cI am an artist,\u201d he said with a faint sneer. \u201cYou are a journalist.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/25/children-commit-crimes-james-bulger-murder-film\">Did we really need a film about the James Bulger murder? | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Film-makers claim that everyone knows they make things up. I am not sure everyone does. But the fictions enter the record as attributed to historical figures. Directors discard the \u201csuspension of disbelief\u201d by using names, appearances, settings and spoken words to claim, \u201cThis is true. This happened. This is what history was really like.\u201d</p> <p>Journalists flatter themselves with the Washington Post\u2019s claim to be \u201ca first rough draft of history\u201d. But they are charged, in the time available, to describe the world as it really is. They rightly call facts sacred. No serious journalist takes pride in inaccuracy. If it occurs, there are lawyers and regulators ready to demand correction.</p> <p>When the likes of Trump accuse the world of fake news, we need tools, definitions, concepts of accuracy to rebut him. Why give him a free pass with fake instant history? If a newspaper declared on its front page, \u201cThese stories are based on real events, and some of them are true\u201d, it would be laughed out of court.

One is \u201cbased on\u201d Queen Anne\u2019s relations with her two ladies-in-waiting, the other on Mary\u2019s relations with Elizabeth I, complete with an invented meeting between them. Both are modernised tales of feminine machismo, their (female) actors speaking today\u2019s foul-mouthed English and treating the male actors as toxic cartoons. The director of The Favourite, Yorgos Lanthimos, remarked casually that \u201csome of the things in the film are accurate and a lot aren\u2019t\u201d. What is a history student to make of that? I am sure the distant past can look after itself. Peddlers of fake history always cite Shakespeare\u2019s Richard III as their template. We should note that it took three centuries for historians to rescue Richard from that hatchet job. We might now ask how long it will take poor, dignified Queen Anne to recover from The Favourite \u2013 or can we rely on television\u2019s admirable fib-chaser Lucy Worsley to do it first? Historical bias is potent. Churchill remarked that history would be kind to him \u201cas I intend to write it myself\u201d. He did, and it was. The most disgraced interwar politician emerged as a saintly hero, single-handed slayer of the demon Hitler. He has remained so ever since. The embellishments in Darkest Hour would have done credit to Russia\u2019s Mosfilm or Mao\u2019s China. More alarming is the appeal of current affairs to ratings-hungry producers. The stories of the British royal family, Dick Cheney, Brexit and \u2013 soon, we can be sure \u2013 Donald Trump have immediacy and relevance. They pander to the (mostly leftwing) biases of actors and directors, with invention excused as \u201cartistic licence\u201d. I recall the reply when I chided a director about his fabricating a scene. \u201cI am an artist,\u201d he said with a faint sneer. \u201cYou are a journalist.\u201d Film-makers claim that everyone knows they make things up. I am not sure everyone does. But the fictions enter the record as attributed to historical figures. Directors discard the \u201csuspension of disbelief\u201d by using names, appearances, settings and spoken words to claim, \u201cThis is true. This happened. This is what history was really like.\u201d Journalists flatter themselves with the Washington Post\u2019s claim to be \u201ca first rough draft of history\u201d. But they are charged, in the time available, to describe the world as it really is. They rightly call facts sacred. No serious journalist takes pride in inaccuracy. If it occurs, there are lawyers and regulators ready to demand correction. When the likes of Trump accuse the world of fake news, we need tools, definitions, concepts of accuracy to rebut him. Why give him a free pass with fake instant history? If a newspaper declared on its front page, \u201cThese stories are based on real events, and some of them are true\u201d, it would be laughed out of court. When films do it, they claim Oscars. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

But her true purpose is much broader: as she writes, the constitution adopted in 1787 was meant to determine whether government could rule \u201cnot by accident and force but by reason and choice\u201d.</p> <p>In America\u2019s other founding document, the declaration of independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d Can this be true, for everyone of whatever race and for women too? Is it possible for the US \u2013 or any nation \u2013 to be ruled by reason and choice? For Lepore, these are the essential questions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is a history of political equality which necessarily becomes primarily a political history</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The \u201cconstitution cannot be made easy\u201d, she writes, because \u201cit was never meant to be easy\u201d. Moreover, she notes that though the United States was \u201cfounded on a set of ideas \u2026 Americans have become so divided that they no longer agree, if they ever did, about what those ideas are, or were\u201d. This is, therefore, a history of political equality which necessarily becomes primarily a political history.</p> <p>It is also, very largely and appropriately, a history of race in America, of the attempts of many to realize \u201cthese truths\u201d and the heartbreaking struggles of those who have been oppressed. This began at the beginning. From 1619, \u201cliberty and slavery became the American Abel and Cain\u201d. The question nearly sundered the colonies from all government. When George Washington died in 1799, Lepore writes, \u201cthe black people in that room outnumbered the white people\u201d. But his will, published throughout the country, delayed emancipation of his slaves until after the death of his wife.</p> <p>In a nation devoted to freedom, why were some free and others not? Like so many Americans, Lepore asks that question and another: \u201cBy what right are we ruled?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfd2190632723f42a33e56217a95e3b8264d4810\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfd2190632723f42a33e56217a95e3b8264d4810/0_263_2000_1199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Death of Washington \u2013 as depicted in rather whitewashed fashion by an unknown artist.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Death of Washington \u2013 as depicted in rather whitewashed fashion by an unknown artist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her aims are ambitious. This is also a history of journalism, including what may be the first real history of the internet in a political context.

      "bodyText": "In the midst of the civil war, when the battle was not going well, Abraham Lincoln wrote that \u201c[w]e must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save the country\u201d. Harvard professor Jill Lepore chooses to begin her history of the United States with that quotation, and much of the worst of America, from lynching to brutality to Native Americans, is rightly here. But her true purpose is much broader: as she writes, the constitution adopted in 1787 was meant to determine whether government could rule \u201cnot by accident and force but by reason and choice\u201d. In America\u2019s other founding document, the declaration of independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d Can this be true, for everyone of whatever race and for women too? Is it possible for the US \u2013 or any nation \u2013 to be ruled by reason and choice? For Lepore, these are the essential questions. The \u201cconstitution cannot be made easy\u201d, she writes, because \u201cit was never meant to be easy\u201d. Moreover, she notes that though the United States was \u201cfounded on a set of ideas \u2026 Americans have become so divided that they no longer agree, if they ever did, about what those ideas are, or were\u201d. This is, therefore, a history of political equality which necessarily becomes primarily a political history. It is also, very largely and appropriately, a history of race in America, of the attempts of many to realize \u201cthese truths\u201d and the heartbreaking struggles of those who have been oppressed. This began at the beginning. From 1619, \u201cliberty and slavery became the American Abel and Cain\u201d. The question nearly sundered the colonies from all government. When George Washington died in 1799, Lepore writes, \u201cthe black people in that room outnumbered the white people\u201d. But his will, published throughout the country, delayed emancipation of his slaves until after the death of his wife. In a nation devoted to freedom, why were some free and others not? Like so many Americans, Lepore asks that question and another: \u201cBy what right are we ruled?\u201d Her aims are ambitious. This is also a history of journalism, including what may be the first real history of the internet in a political context. It is also a history of technology and a history of religion, which has influenced so much American life and thought. Finally, \u201cthis book aims to be something else, too \u2013 an explanation of the nature of the past.\u201d \u201cHistory isn\u2019t only a subject,\u201d Lepore writes. \u201cIt\u2019s also a method. My method is, generally, to let the dead speak for themselves.\u201d Lepore therefore gives prominence to figures such as Caesar, a slave hanged for rebellion in colonial New York; David Walker, a ship chandler who founded the first African American political organization; Mary Lease, a leading figure in the populist movement of the 19th century; and Ivy Lee, a pioneer in public relations, for good or ill. She tells new stories, such as that of Harry Washington, an escaped slave from Mount Vernon who went to Canada and then to the new colony of Sierra Leone, or of southern women rioting for bread during the civil war who thereby helped lay the foundation of a public welfare system. It is the story of a nation, multiracial at its founding, and those who sought to find ways to realize \u201cthese truths\u201d. In the 1800s, Frederick Douglass admired the new art of photography because it represented faces perfectly rather than through the subtle distortions of painting, and could therefore help African Americans speak for themselves.

American politics has always been robust, but technology and better methods of analysis have magnified the impact. Lepore entitles her section on recent history \u201cThe Machine\u201d: a double entendre for the political \u201cmachines\u201d of the past.

It\u2019s not quite accurate to say that this book is Lepore\u2019s response to or explanation of the election of Donald Trump, but that event constantly lurks in the background, from a discussion of Joseph Pulitzer\u2019s quest for accurate journalism based on facts to meditations on the forces of populism, reaction and nativism throughout American history. Lepore also links Trump firmly to the deleterious \u2013 and often anti-democratic \u2013 technological and campaigning innovations of the last 50 years: \u201cPolls admitted Trump into the GOP debates, polls placed him at center stage, and polls declared him the winner \u2026 Time posted this warning: \u2018The results of this poll are not scientific.\u2019 Less reputable websites did not bother with disclaimers.\u201d There is always a debate about where politics ends and history begins.

      "body": "<p>On Father\u2019s Day last year, Marvyn Harrison sent a WhatsApp message to a handful of friends to tell them he was thinking of them, and that he appreciated what they were doing as fathers. They all replied straight away. As Harrison was showered with thanks, he understood that he had tapped into something significant. \u201cThanks for trying to change the \u2018missing black father\u2019 narrative,\u201d wrote one friend. \u201cSometimes dads get left off the radar, and black dads don\u2019t get credit,\u201d wrote another.</p> <p>Harrison had given voice to a discontent that had been building since his son was born three years earlier, and that had come to a head a few months before with the birth of his daughter, Olivia. He felt no one was talking about what it means to be a black father today, and the lack of a positive conversation struck him as depressing.</p> <p>\u201cI just wanted to wish them a happy Father\u2019s Day and say thank you for their positive influence in the lives of their children,\u201d says Harrison, 35, an advertising executive. As the year progressed, his small WhatsApp group grew rapidly to include fathers beyond the UK, in New York and South Africa. \u201cWe became a community built around knowledge-sharing and support,\u201d Harrison says.</p> <p>Within a few months, the group needed a bigger platform. Harrison downloaded a podcasting app, invited a few friends along for a chat, and <a href=\"https://www.dopeblackdads.com/\" title=\"\">Dope Black Dads</a> was born.</p> <p>Launched in October 2018 to coincide with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blackhistorymonth\" title=\"\">Black History Month</a>, the Dope Black Dads podcast now has more than 60 contributors from around the world, regularly discussing everything from co-parenting and blended families of mixed faith, to sex and race. \u201cWe wanted to give people a greater understanding of our narrative,\u201d Harrison says. \u201cI can\u2019t convince someone who goes on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/tommy-robinson\" title=\"\">Tommy Robinson</a> rally that I don\u2019t need to go \u2018home\u2019. But I can start a conversation with those who are open-minded enough to listen about the sorts of things we are facing as we raise black children.\u201d</p> <p>For the fathers themselves, the benefits have been huge. \u201cSome of the things we talk about, like the problems dads face when they\u2019ve split up with their child\u2019s mum, or knife crime, are not things we could necessarily verbalise in our relationships,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to inform and help black fathers to make sure they can play an active part in their kids\u2019 lives and be supportive to their partners.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As well as \u2018Eat your greens\u2019, there\u2019s showing your children they might be judged differently</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The thing about being a black father, he says, is that it makes your role as a parent more complex. \u201cThe parenting part, day-to-day, is the same. But what you\u2019re trying to teach your child is much more layered. You\u2019re trying to show them that having a different skin tone or hair might mean they are judged differently. You\u2019re adding that to all the other stuff, like \u2018Eat your greens\u2019 and \u2018Be careful how you cross the road.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It often takes becoming a parent to fully appreciate your own. When you\u2019re a black dad whose own absent father was a son of the Windrush generation, with its attendant problems, Harrison says, the experience is even more intense. \u201cWhen my son Blake was born, I rang my mum from the delivery room in tears. I didn\u2019t know becoming a dad could be so life-changing. When I saw that little person we\u2019d made, right in front of us, I started caring about so many things I\u2019d never thought about before. I realised I\u2019d taken Mum, who raised four kids by herself, for granted.\u201d</p> <p>He also felt a flash of anger towards his father, who left when he was 18 months old and whom he has hardly seen since. \u201cI\u2019d never felt I lacked anything in terms of love or security. But when I had my son all those years later I did feel angry about my dad leaving,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I decided I wasn\u2019t going to use the fact that I never knew my dad as a get-out for being a bad father myself.\u201d</p> <p>He was also able to reflect on the circumstances his own father and grandfather had faced \u2013 the circumstances that moulded them as dads. \u201cMy grandfather, and so many men like him, had to start from the absolute bottom when he arrived from Jamaica <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/07/caribritish-me-my-family-and-the-legacy-of-windrush\" title=\"\">as part of the Windrush generation</a>,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was so disillusioned. The more stories I hear \u2013 from my gran, aunts, uncles and friends \u2013 the more I realise how soul-destroying it must have been.\u201d</p> <p>The next generation, the children who grew up in Britain in the 70s, were also starting at a disadvantage, he says. \u201cLots of them, like my dad, had pretty terrible upbringings. Many didn\u2019t come from two-parent families, and their fathers\u2019 anger and resentment at feeling they didn\u2019t belong in Britain often manifested itself as disruptive behaviour. Drinking, hanging around on the street and in betting shops, and then coming home and taking it out on their wife and kids.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t, he believes, that his father didn\u2019t want to be a dad; it was the ripple effect of his own childhood. \u201cSo you can start to see why some of us \u2013 their children and grandchildren \u2013 might struggle as parents.\u201d</p> <p>These struggles became clear when Olivia was born and Harrison was confronted with a fresh set of concerns. \u201cI thought about all the issues that might affect her: sexism, racial discrimination, and what it might be like growing up as a young black female. I want to skill her up to the hilt to make sure she can look after herself.\u201d</p> <p>Dope Black Dads is Harrison\u2019s way of turning the experience of being a black father into a positive force; the podcast is genuine, candid and heartfelt, and he is justifiably proud of how it has grown. \u201cEach time we do a podcast, someone else comes forward and says, \u2018Yes, I can relate to that.\u2019 It\u2019s a great feeling,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Harrison is under no illusions that his children will experience a level playing field by the time they\u2019ve grown up. \u201cRacism isn\u2019t going to have died in 20 years\u2019 time. It\u2019s going to take a lot longer to change prejudices and ideas.\u201d But he hopes that his podcast will be a step in the right direction, and that it might stop black dads from feeling alone. As one Dope Black Dad puts it: \u201cIt\u2019s about time we had a black dads\u2019 movement, bruv.\u201d</p>",

But what you\u2019re trying to teach your child is much more layered. You\u2019re trying to show them that having a different skin tone or hair might mean they are judged differently. You\u2019re adding that to all the other stuff, like \u2018Eat your greens\u2019 and \u2018Be careful how you cross the road.\u2019\u201d It often takes becoming a parent to fully appreciate your own. When you\u2019re a black dad whose own absent father was a son of the Windrush generation, with its attendant problems, Harrison says, the experience is even more intense. \u201cWhen my son Blake was born, I rang my mum from the delivery room in tears. I didn\u2019t know becoming a dad could be so life-changing. When I saw that little person we\u2019d made, right in front of us, I started caring about so many things I\u2019d never thought about before. I realised I\u2019d taken Mum, who raised four kids by herself, for granted.\u201d He also felt a flash of anger towards his father, who left when he was 18 months old and whom he has hardly seen since. \u201cI\u2019d never felt I lacked anything in terms of love or security. But when I had my son all those years later I did feel angry about my dad leaving,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I decided I wasn\u2019t going to use the fact that I never knew my dad as a get-out for being a bad father myself.\u201d He was also able to reflect on the circumstances his own father and grandfather had faced \u2013 the circumstances that moulded them as dads. \u201cMy grandfather, and so many men like him, had to start from the absolute bottom when he arrived from Jamaica as part of the Windrush generation,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was so disillusioned. The more stories I hear \u2013 from my gran, aunts, uncles and friends \u2013 the more I realise how soul-destroying it must have been.\u201d The next generation, the children who grew up in Britain in the 70s, were also starting at a disadvantage, he says. \u201cLots of them, like my dad, had pretty terrible upbringings. Many didn\u2019t come from two-parent families, and their fathers\u2019 anger and resentment at feeling they didn\u2019t belong in Britain often manifested itself as disruptive behaviour. Drinking, hanging around on the street and in betting shops, and then coming home and taking it out on their wife and kids.\u201d It wasn\u2019t, he believes, that his father didn\u2019t want to be a dad; it was the ripple effect of his own childhood. \u201cSo you can start to see why some of us \u2013 their children and grandchildren \u2013 might struggle as parents.\u201d These struggles became clear when Olivia was born and Harrison was confronted with a fresh set of concerns. \u201cI thought about all the issues that might affect her: sexism, racial discrimination, and what it might be like growing up as a young black female. I want to skill her up to the hilt to make sure she can look after herself.\u201d Dope Black Dads is Harrison\u2019s way of turning the experience of being a black father into a positive force; the podcast is genuine, candid and heartfelt, and he is justifiably proud of how it has grown. \u201cEach time we do a podcast, someone else comes forward and says, \u2018Yes, I can relate to that.\u2019 It\u2019s a great feeling,\u201d he says. Harrison is under no illusions that his children will experience a level playing field by the time they\u2019ve grown up. \u201cRacism isn\u2019t going to have died in 20 years\u2019 time. It\u2019s going to take a lot longer to change prejudices and ideas.\u201d But he hopes that his podcast will be a step in the right direction, and that it might stop black dads from feeling alone. As one Dope Black Dad puts it: \u201cIt\u2019s about time we had a black dads\u2019 movement, bruv.\u201d",

Six hundred kilometres away, in Melbourne, his comments were echoed to a crowd of more than 40,000 people who congregated on Spring Street outside Parliament House before the Invasion Day march. \u201cThose poor people were in chains, they were suffering we pitied them,\u201d a speaker said. \u201cWhat are you defending?\u201d The rally in Melbourne followed a dawn service at the memorial marking the burial site of 38 Aboriginal people from across Victoria, who represented those killed in the frontier wars. \u201cIf this country has any conscience, it will start a healing process that starts with truth-telling,\u201d the former Greens MP Lidia Thorpe, a Gunnai-Gunditjmara woman, told the rally. \u201cYou fellas come out one day of the year, which is fantastic, but we feel this every day. And we need you every day \u2026 it is upon you from today to decide whether you want to come out once a year and protest or you act every single day to change what this country is about.\u201d The crowd estimates ranged from 5,000, an early figure given by Victoria Police, and 80,000, cited by organisers. At its longest point, it stretched two blocks down Swanston Street, from Bourke Street to Flinders Street station. Large protests were also held in Sydney, Brisbane, Canberra, Hobart and Perth, and survival day events in Adelaide and Darwin. The academic and activist Gary Foley told the crowd, the majority of whom were non-Indigenous, not to go away feeling \u201cself-satisfied\u201d. He said that if everyone at the march read up on the history of Australia and then told 10 more people, \u201cnext year we would have half of Melbourne on our side\u201d. The march organiser Meriki Onus urged the crowd to stay behind strict marshal lines and not engage with a reported counter-protest run by far-right groups in Federation Square. That protest had about 10 participants and was dispersed by police before the main march turned down Swanston Street. Two people, a man draped in an Australian flag and a woman holding a sign that said \u201cTo defend my country was once called patriotism; now it\u2019s called racism\u201d remained at the Flinders Street station steps. They were surrounded for about 20 minutes by marchers chanting \u201cgo home, fascists\u201d, before the police had them move on on. A spokeswoman for Victoria Police said it was too early to comment on whether any charges were being laid. Tens of thousands of people also attended a rally in Sydney, where the early crowd estimates were put at up to 50,000, while thousands more marched in Brisbane, Canberra, Hobart, and Perth. The protest numbers in all capital cities were reported to be the largest yet. In London, activists hung a banner from Westminster Bridge, which said \u201cAbolish Australia Day\u201d; in Berlin a protest was planned.",

Coming into the tournament the question was always where the goals were likely to come from and in the end the team failed to score in three of their five matches despite controlling possession in the majority of those outings. What was an emerging trend at last year\u2019s World Cup has now become an established pattern of play in that a majority of teams at international level are happier sitting deep and striking on the counter and Australia struggled mightily to break down those kinds of nations at the Asian Cup. In a clash where there were five times as many fouls as shots on target by both nations, the Emirates converted one of the two chances they had after a misplaced back pass from Degenek allowed poacher Ali Mabkhout to round Mat Ryan and slot home in the 68th minute. As they had before and after that moment Australia looked the more comfortable in possession but rarely managed to convert that into serious chances with a lack of penetration in central areas as they missed the game-changing qualities of the suspended Tom Rogic. A rejigged 4-2-2-2 formation was designed to see Australia play in a more direct manner but rarely did the team manage to find a way to free the front pairing of Jamie Maclaren and Apo Giannou. By the time the late spark arrived in the form of Mathew Leckie \u2013 who ended the match with a gruesome head wound that required numerous stitches \u2013 and the returning Andrew Nabbout, UAE had gone into full delay mode with the numerous injury stoppages robbing Australia of the momentum they needed. After having made the final at the previous two editions the quarter-final exit matches that of the first stint that Graham Arnold had as coach back in 2007 but post-match the message was very much one of positivity from the former Sydney FC boss. \u201cIt\u2019s football, it can be a cruel sport and is the only one in the world where you can control possession and chances on goal, spend more time in the opposition half and still lose. \u201cIt\u2019s the start of a four-year journey for the team and I couldn\u2019t be prouder of the boys though what\u2019s been a long camp. It\u2019s been a wonderful experience for myself and the staff and the country should be very proud.\u201d One player for whom it clearly wasn\u2019t a wonderful experience was 24-year-old Degenek who you have to credit for fronting up post-match when it would\u2019ve been easier to put his head down and stroll out of the Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium without greeting waiting reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s a shit situation, shit to be in my shoes and skin but that\u2019s football. I don\u2019t feel sorry so much for myself as I do for my country and my teammates because we ended a tournament because of my mistake, but that\u2019s life. \u201cI\u2019ve got to deal with it, I\u2019m 24 years of age, I\u2019m a man and I can accept I did the mistake.\u201d What FFA and the coaching staff now need to deal with is a way to ensure the team keeps evolving before what will arguably be one of the toughest World Cup qualifying campaigns they\u2019ve experienced when things get under way later this year. At an Asian Cup that hasn\u2019t been distinguished by elite play, what has been apparent is that the gap between those at the top and the bottom is narrowing and that\u2019s a wake up call for Australia, according to Arnold. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great experience for us and we go home having learned a lot. The Middle East isn\u2019t an easy place to come and play and I have to congratulate UAE and Qatar, two Middle Eastern countries, for doing well. \u201cThe one message for everybody in Australia is just how fast other nations across Asia are catching up.\u201d",

A great credit here should also be given to newcomer Simba, whose lead performance is really quite extraordinary. With his soulful eyes and infectious enthusiasm, he anchors the drama around him, easily steering himself through the story\u2019s emotional shifts as he matures from a playful child to a philanthropic saviour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bfe709d8f3d631cd6e7355d67283f8e7f7d6f9bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfe709d8f3d631cd6e7355d67283f8e7f7d6f9bb/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maxwell Simba, Lily Banda, Chiwetel Ejiofor and A\u00efssa Ma\u00efga in The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maxwell Simba, Lily Banda, Chiwetel Ejiofor and A\u00efssa Ma\u00efga in The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ilze Kitshoff/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Ejiofor does pitch the film at a broad audience, he makes a key decision not to force his characters to always speak English.

      "bodyText": "Thank you very much for joining me today for what was a thrilling end to a superb WBBL season. Well done Brisbane Heat, worthy winners on a fantastic day for women\u2019s cricket at a sold out Drummoyne Oval. There\u2019s plenty more OBO coverage to come today though, so feel free to nip on over to live coverage of the opening men\u2019s Test against Sri Lanka where Adam Collins is already firing out the updates. Kirby Short accepts the WBBL trophy, raises it above her head and then joins her teammates in whoops of delight. The Brisbane players are now parading across the dais to receive their medals. Beth Mooney is named the player of the final. No surprise really, her 65 was the defining hand in the match and set the tone early for Brisbane\u2019s run chase. That she did it suffering from heat exhaustion only made it even more impressive. Ellyse Perry has been named the player of the tournament. 777 runs and ten wickets. Handy. Today she scored 33, bowled her four overs for 0/20 and took a superb catch. Brisbane\u2019s players are all being interviewed out on Drummoyne Oval. The responses are variations of disbelief. Plenty of broad smiles and jubilant hugs. Tremendous scenes. Deep breaths. What a finish. Gripping end to a superb tournament. The underdogs have done it. 19.2 over: Brisbane Heat 132-7 (L Harris 9, Kimmince 2) Harris slaps a short delivery away to the midwicket fence, two Sixers fielders converge and slide into each other on the boundary, the ball bobbling through the collision and over the rope. Brisbane win! 19.1 over: Brisbane Heat 128-7 (L Harris 5, Kimmince 2) Kimmince slices into the offside for a single. Four runs to win. Final over coming up. Kapp has 1/11 from her three overs so far. Harris and Kimmince at the crease. Superb sporting drama. Heat connect sweetly to the opening three deliveries of van Niekerk\u2019s over but they all find fielders. The fourth beats the ring and Wolvaardt celebrates four over cover. She\u2019s not celebrating for long though, after slogging to cow corner she chances Kapp\u2019s arm with a second run and finds herself a few inches short when Healy whips off the bails. Five required to win from the final over! The drama! 19th over: Brisbane Heat 127-6 (L Harris 5, Kimmince 1) 18th over: Brisbane Heat 117-6 (L Harris 4, Wolvaardt 1) Huge over from Burns. The asking rate climbs to 15 from 12, and Heat now have just four wickets in hand. Erin Burns comes back for her fourth and final over. Heat begin with a pair of twos, the second of whcih should have been a run-out but Healy can\u2019t hold on to Kapp\u2019s bullet throw with a dismissal at her mercy. It matters little though, Dooley missing a Burns full toss leaving the umpire with little choice but to send her back to the pavilion. 17th over: Brisbane Heat 112-5 (L Harris 4, Dooley 5) Perry backs herself to take responsibility and she delivers. A single precedes three dot balls, the second of which almost ends in a run-out. The Heat are trying too hard to go big instead of working the gaps and picking off the singles - the run-rate is still in Brisbane\u2019s favour. Two singles close out the over. 20 required from 18 balls. 16th over: Brisbane Heat 109-5 (L Harris 3, Dooley 3) This is becoming a gripping final and out of nowhere the crowd is suddenly involved. Can Brisbane hold their nerve? The Sixers have upped the intensity over the past couple of overs but they still need to keep picking up wickets. What is happening out there!? Third wicket in seven balls and the Heat are collapsing. This time Jonassen gets herself in all sorts of trouble attempting to reverse sweep. The ball strikes her tangled legs near enough in front, but with a hint that contact could have been outside the line of off stump. Regardless, the finger was raised and Jonassen has to go. Here we go! Mooney\u2019s super innings ends with a super catch by Ellyse Perry. The Heat left-hander tried to loft van Niekerk over the infield but got too much on it and it carried all the way to the sweeping Perry who sprinted in, dived forward, and held onto a brilliant catch. This game is alive again! 15th over: Brisbane Heat 103-4 (Jonassen 2, Dooley 0) Could that be the moment that brings the Sixers back into the mix? Short tries to take van Niekerk downtown but doesn\u2019t get all of it. Short runs around from long-on and holds onto a good catch. 14th over: Brisbane Heat 98-2 (Mooney 62, Short 29) The Heat are cruising now, finding runs at will, conventionally and improvised. Mooney continues to impress under duress, lapping for a couple then lofting for a couple more, repeating the latter later in the over to bring the required run-rate below 6rpo. Mooney is now batting in an ice vest. 13th over: Brisbane Heat 89-2 (Mooney 55, Short 27) Perry brings herself back into the attack as the Sixers desperately try to regain a foothold in this contest. But the all-rounder\u2019s extra pace works in the Heat\u2019s favour when Short slashes an edge just beyond Healy and away for four and Mooney larrups a length delivery over mid-on for another boundary. 12th over: Brisbane Heat 79-2 (Mooney 50, Short 22) Eighth bowler for the Sixers in just the 12th over with Erin Burns handed an opportunity. She has a big shout for LBW declined then almost has Short caught reverse sweeping. She can\u2019t prevent Beth Mooney from reaching her 50 though. What a courageous and important knock this is becoming. 11th over: Brisbane Heat 74-2 (Mooney 48, Short 19) Van Niekerk back into the attack and it should have brought about the end of Mooney but Lauren Smith makes a mess of a straightforward throw to Healy and the run out opportunity goes begging. Mooney is really struggling out there. She received plenty of attention during a drinks break for heat exhaustion. But while she\u2019s at the crease she\u2019s doing all she can to help her side, running consecutive twos then sweeping a boundary, ending each passage of play doubled over gulping in air. This is becoming the Mooney final. Can she last long enough to see the Heat home? 10th over: Brisbane Heat 64-2 (Mooney 39, Short 18) The Heat are flying now. Even Short\u2019s getting in on the act, cutting Lauren Cheatle\u2019s first delivery for two then stepping across her stumps to flick a confident four off her toes. Meanwhile, Mooney looks to be struggling with the heat out there (no pun intended). She is spending a lot of time crouching on her haunches and looking in discomfort in between deliveries. 9th over: Brisbane Heat 57-2 (Mooney 39, Short 11) Another bowling change with Perry reverting to Lauren Smith\u2019s off-spin, but she begins with a howler, a no-ball full toss that Mooney slaps for four, the Heat star backing it up by driving the free hit for another four through long-off. A third boundary in the over follows another full toss and the momentum in this final has swung wildly the Heat\u2019s way. 8th over: Brisbane Heat 42-2 (Mooney 27, Short 10) The experienced Sarah Aley comes into the attack and it prompts some brilliant improvisation from Mooney, adjusting her stance early and ramping a boundary over Alyssa Healy\u2019s head. Mooney is looking ominous and firming as the decisive character in this final. At the other end Short is doing well to keep the scoreboard ticking over. 7th over: Brisbane Heat 35-2 (Mooney 22, Short 8) Dane van Niekerk\u2019s turn to roll her arm over but she might regret stepping up the crease. Mooney\u2019s intent is finally rewarded with a boundary through cow corner. Some sharp running means only one dot ball from the over. 6th over: Brisbane Heat 26-2 (Mooney 15, Short 6) Perry gives herself a second over and it\u2019s a tidy one, plenty of pace on a good line and length. Again, Mooney is busy at the crease and looking to impose herself but she\u2019s struggling to find much of the strike or penetrate the infield. 5th over: Brisbane Heat 23-2 (Mooney 13, Short 5) Kapp\u2019s spell extends to three overs and another excellent set of six goes for just four singles. Mooney is looking to assert herself but the bowling has been good enough to keep in check so far. 4th over: Brisbane Heat 19-2 (Mooney 11, Short 3) After 33 with the bat, time for Ellyse Perry to show what she can do with the ball. It\u2019s a tidy start, just four singles for the Heat, and another run out chance with Mooney well out of her ground with a direct hit from cover, but the throw was well off target. 3rd over: Brisbane Heat 15-2 (Mooney 9, Short 1) Kapp gave a full throated roar in the direction of Johnson when that wicket fell. Lovely stuff. Another boundary for the Heat, this time Sammy-Jo Johnson timing Kapp beautifully through the covers. But that\u2019s as good as things get for the Heat No3. She goes for the slog two balls later, misses, and the zing bails light up. The Sixers are fighting back hard early in the Heat innings. 2nd over: Brisbane Heat 10-1 (Mooney 9, Johnson 0) Mooney retains her composure to rock back and fire Gardner behind point for another boundary. It\u2019s all happening at Drummoyne Oval. Ashleigh Gardner\u2019s spin up next but her first delivery from around the wicket is lofted disdainfully over the covers by Mooney for the Heat\u2019s first boundary. A wicket follows soon afterwards though, and it\u2019s calamitous for the Heat. Mooney dabbed the ball into the covers and there was talk of a run but eventually she sends her partner back. Harris turns, slips mid-pitch, twists her already proppy knee and is unable to recover her ground in time. Early gift for the Sixers. 1st over: Brisbane Heat 2-0 (Harris 1, Mooney 1) Marizanna Kapp opens the bowling for the Sixers. She has the best economy rate in WBBL4 and enhances those figures by conceding just two runs in a tight opening over. Grace Harris And Beth Mooney both get off the mark for the Heat with squirty outside edges down to third. The sides are back out on Drummoyne Oval for the Heat run chase. A below-par showing with the bat from the Sixers but that late blast from van Niekerk has given them something to defend. The Heat bowled superbly throughout but they may live to rue some sloppy fielding. 20th over: Sydney Sixers 131-7 (van Niekerk 32) This has become the van Niekerk show late in the innings. After Kapp\u2019s dismissal some good running earned two twos, four runs bookending a fine six over cow corner. A single hands Lauren Smith one delivery but the wily Harris drops it wide of off stump, Smith chases it, misses, and Mooney completes a very sharp stumping. First ball of the final over and Kapp mistimes a drive off Grace Harris. Short holds on nicely on the ring at cover. 19th over: Sydney Sixers 120-5 (van Niekerk 21, Kapp 7) Kimmince has bowled superbly all day but her figures are muddied by van Niekerk finding the boundary with her final two deliveries. The first was a rank full toss that was helped on its way to the fine-leg fence, the second was a mighty six swung way over midwicket. 18th over: Sydney Sixers 107-5 (van Niekerk 10, Kapp 6) The first boundary in an age finally releases some pressure. Jonassen dropped short and van Niekerk was on it in a flash, pulling between the two boundary riders in front of square on the leg side. A poor over for the Heat ends in disastrous fashion. Kapp slog sweeps and Wolvaardt drops another sitter at mid-on. Woah! What a catch from Beth Mooney! Erin Burns telegraphed a reverse sweep allowing the Heat keeper chance to shift her starting position, meaning that when the fine glance was executed to what was an orthodox first slip position, Mooney was ready to dive and pouch a blinding catch. Kimmince has her second and the Sixers are crumbling. 17th over: Sydney Sixers 98-5 (van Niekerk 5, Kapp 1) 16th over: Sydney Sixers 94-4 (Burns 11, van Niekerk 3) Third over in a row without a boundary for the Sixers. Birkett concedes just five singles from her second over. It\u2019s all unravelling now for the Sixers. McGlashan the latest to go, failing to clear mid-on with her lofted drive. That gives Johnson a wicket with the final delivery of her spell. She ends with 1/22. Earlier in the over there were panic stations at Drummoyne Oval. Some shocking Sixers calling should have ended in a run out but the Heat made a mess in the field with both ends open to dismissals. 15th over: Sydney Sixers 89-4 (Burns 9) 14th over: Sydney Sixers 86-3 (Burns 7, McGlashan 1) The Sixers have been dealing largely in singles throughout their innings and whenever one of their batters has looked to accelerate it\u2019s soon brought about their downfall. Three starts but no big individual knock for the favourites, and the Heat will be very happy indeed right now. Massive moment in the match with Jonassen returning to the attack and snaring the vital wicket of Perry. Eager to accelerate Perry went the slog sweep but could only find a top edge that looped high in the air and safely into Beth Mooney\u2019s gloves. Advantage Heat once again. 13th over: Sydney Sixers 81-2 (Perry 32, Burns 4) Barsby continues her excellent spell but a well-crafted over is disturbed by Erin Burns sweeping powerfully for four from the final delivery. 12th over: Sydney Sixers 72-2 (Perry 28, Burns 0) Grace Harris continues to get away with some indifferent bowling. Lines and lengths have been far from consistent with a liberal smattering of full tosses but she has figures of 1/12 from three overs, including the vital wicket of Gardner. Gardner has been looking for the big hit for a few overs now and when she finally connects she dumps it straight into the safe hands of Kimmince on the cow corner boundary. 11th over: Sydney Sixers 67-1 (Perry 24, Gardner 22) Jemma Barsby is the latest Heat bowler to be invited to the crease and she lands her right-arm offies from over the wicket beautifully. Four dots precede a HUGE CHANCE but Laura Harris drops a sitter at long-off after Perry bit off more than she could chew How big a moment will that prove to be? 10th over: Sydney Sixers 61-1 (Perry 21, Gardner 19) Harris gets a second over and it goes for only five despite the Heat spinner not hitting her marks. With the platform laid, Gardner is looking to accelerate but she isn\u2019t timing everything she leans into. 9th over: Sydney Sixers 56-1 (Perry 18, Gardner 17) Johnson back into the attack for her second spell but she returns to find a blossoming partnership. 16 balls without a dot now for the Heat and 11 from an over that sees both Sixers batters busy at the crease, working the gaps, running hard, and ending with Gardner slapping a lofted drive to the cow corner boundary. 8th over: Sydney Sixers 45-1 (Perry 16, Gardner 9) Haidee Birkett\u2019s turn for a bowl but it\u2019s not the most auspicious of starts. Attempting to bowl off-pace stump-to-stump Birkett\u2019s line drifts onto Perry\u2019s pads with four the inevitable result, before width outside off results in a couple. Around that there are four singles to keep the Sixers moving. 7th over: Sydney Sixers 35-1 (Perry 8, Gardner 7) A rare boundary from the Sixers and a reminder of the importance of length on this surface. Kimmince overpitches and Gardner climbs into a drive that soars over cover for four. The rest of the over is comprised mainly of scoreboard moving singles. 6th over: Sydney Sixers 28-1 (Perry 7, Gardner 1) Time for Grace Harris, bowling her offies in a baseball cap and shades. She gets away with three full tosses and a long hop in a fortunate over that goes for just two. Perry and Gardner are both lacking timing, and both have unerringly found the ring. Heat well on top early on here at the end of the powerplay. 5th over: Sydney Sixers 26-1 (Perry 6, Gardner 0) Fantastic over from Kimmince. After removing the dangerous Healy her wobble away from the right-handers befuddles Ashleigh Gardner who is unable to do much with four length deliveries outside her off stump. Delissa Kimmince into the attack and she strikes immediately - and it\u2019s a beauty! Perfect line and length from the seamer, a touch of movement away from the right-hander and into the top of off, ending Healy\u2019s brief stay at the crease. Huge early breakthrough for the Heat. 4th over: Sydney Sixers 25-0 (Healy 18, Perry 5) Jonassen continues, successfully angling the ball into the two right-handers from around the wicket for four deliveries but Healy can\u2019t be shackled indefinitely, a sashay down the pitch and out to leg gives her room to free her arms and she deposits a length delivery into the sight-screen. That\u2019s followed up by rocking back and pulling forcefully for three. The Sixers up and running. 3rd over: Sydney Sixers 12-0 (Healy 7, Perry 3) Length is going to be crucial today. Anything full is in the slot to drive, anything short can be pulled confidently. The Heat have hit their marks superbly so far though, Johnson on the short side of a good length, mixing her pace and finding enough movement to deny the Sixers any rhythm. 2nd over: Sydney Sixers 9-0 (Healy 7, Perry 1) Jess Jonassen shares the new ball for the Heat and her left-arm orthodox from around the wicket does a superb job. Five dot balls and single are all the Sixers can muster, both batters cramped for room and unable to pierce the well-placed field. 1st over: Sydney Sixers 8-0 (Healy 7, Perry 0) Sammy-Jo Johnson has the unenviable task of bowling to Ellyse Perry and Alyssa Healy to begin this WBBL final. She starts well enough, finding a bit of shape away from the right-handers with her right-arm medium-fast but this is a hard flat track allowing Healy to hit confidently through the line, which she does for a lofted four over the covers. We\u2019re underway in the WBBL final in Sydney! The players are making their way out onto Drummoyne Oval, Heat in the field, Healy and Perry into bat. The Sixers are more than just Ellyse Perry. Teammate and international superstar Alyssa Healy has plenty of grand final pedigree. Ellyse Perry has been the dominant force in WBBL this season, and as Lisa Sthalekar writes it\u2019s the final feather in the all-rounder\u2019s cap. Few cricketers have been able to master all formats, yet remarkably since her return from Australia\u2019s successful Women\u2019s World T20 in the West Indies last year, Perry has managed to take her T20 game to another level and delivered the most dominant individual season in Women\u2019s Big Bash League history. Awesome. Umpires today are David Shepard and Donovan Koch with Claire Polosak keeping an eye on events on TV. These sides have met twice already this season for one win apiece. Curiously, Heat registered near identical scores on both occasions - 154/7 &amp; 155/7. Heat\u2019s victory came courtesy of two exceptional all-round displays from Jess Jonassen and Sammy-Jo Johnson. The Sixers\u2019 triumph included an unbeaten ton to Ellyse Perry. There are plenty of stories circulating of fans missing out on tickets for today\u2019s match, unaware there was the risk of a sell-out. This wasn\u2019t bad either. Haidee Brikett winning the match for the Heat when a six would have seen Sydney Thunder into the decider and a four would have taken the game to a super over. 20 minutes to go until we\u2019re underway. Time to recap the final moments of each semi-final. Seriously, this was just absurd. The underdogs Brisbane Heat are also unchanged. They finished third on the regular season ladder with nine wins, but by far the best net run rate in the competition. The Sixers are unchanged. After topping the ladder with ten wins from 14 matches the magenta machine will start strong favourites. We\u2019ll get an early look at that fearsome Sixers top order on a deck that looks full of runs. If we get a final half as good as either of the semis we\u2019re in for a treat. As Megan Maurice reported, \u201cwomen\u2019s cricket is producing some of the most exciting and entertaining sporting contests in the world right now.\u201d It\u2019s a beautiful clear hot day in Sydney, perfect for cricket-watching (with a bit of slip slop slap). Watching the crowds flock to Drummoyne Oval is testament to the quality of this year\u2019s WBBL and the ability of Australia\u2019s WT20 World Cup winning stars to force their way into the sporting mainstream. Good morning and thank you for joining me for live OBO coverage of the Women\u2019s Big Bash League final between Sydney Sixers and Brisbane Heat. The picturesque Drummoyne Oval in the middle of Sydney is a 5,000 sell-out for the occasion, a fitting backdrop to the conclusion of what has been a superb tournament. Play begins at 10.10am.

He said he was a \u201clittle tired\u201d, but glad to be on the show. </p> <p>Stone said his early-morning arrest by the FBI was unnecessary: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I had no firearm in the house. I don\u2019t have a permit for a firearm. I don\u2019t own a firearm. Only my wife, three dogs and two cats were at home ... I\u2019m not a flight risk ... Frankly, they could have just contacted my attorney, and I would have voluntarily turned myself in. </p> </blockquote> <p>He also criticized CNN for its live coverage of his dramatic arrest. CNN has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/25/politics/roger-stone-raid/index.html\">said</a> its journalists were staking out Stone\u2019s house because there was enough evidence in Mueller\u2019s investigation suggesting the arrest might happen. But Stone said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s disconcerting that CNN was aware that I would be arrested before my lawyers were informed, so that\u2019s disturbing.</p> </blockquote> <p>Stone, with support from Carlson, painted himself as a victim of a larger conspiracy: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is about silencing me. There\u2019s a war on alternative media \u2026 There\u2019s a war where they\u2019re trying to criminalize free speech ... I intend to plead not guilty. I believe I will be vindicated ...

Mr. Stone played a key role in recruiting Paul Manafort to run the Trump campaign, and he publicly claimed on several occasions to remain in regular contact with then-candidate Trump throughout the 2016 presidential race, even after he formally departed the Trump campaign.

      "bodyText": "All right, folks. Thanks for tuning in on an eventful day. The East Coast team will be back bright and early tomorrow with the latest: Rumors floated about over imminent and not-so imminent announcements regarding the 2020 presidential race. Despite a Yahoo News report saying Bernie Sanders was set to announce, his team denied that any decision was imminent later Friday. Meanwhile, Beto O\u2019Rourke says it might be \u201cmonths\u201d before he comes to a decision. In the latest in the Venezuela saga, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo named Elliott Abrams, a diplomat with ties to the Iran-Contra affair, as a new special envoy to Venezuela. Roger Stone, Trump\u2019s longtime adviser who was arrested, indicted and released all today, went on a television tour this evening, appearing first on Tucker Carlson\u2019s show and later on Chris Cuomo\u2019s show. The Nixon Foundation, in the meantime, made an effort to distance themselves. Donald Trump has agreed to reopen the government, and not a moment too soon for some government agencies who need to take some proactive steps in protecting their cybersecurity. Roger Stone, Trump\u2019s longtime adviser who was arrested, indicted and released earlier today, has just spoken to a sympathetic Tucker Carlson on Fox News. He said he was a \u201clittle tired\u201d, but glad to be on the show. Stone said his early-morning arrest by the FBI was unnecessary: I had no firearm in the house. I don\u2019t have a permit for a firearm. I don\u2019t own a firearm. Only my wife, three dogs and two cats were at home ... I\u2019m not a flight risk ... Frankly, they could have just contacted my attorney, and I would have voluntarily turned myself in. He also criticized CNN for its live coverage of his dramatic arrest. CNN has said its journalists were staking out Stone\u2019s house because there was enough evidence in Mueller\u2019s investigation suggesting the arrest might happen. But Stone said: It\u2019s disconcerting that CNN was aware that I would be arrested before my lawyers were informed, so that\u2019s disturbing. Stone, with support from Carlson, painted himself as a victim of a larger conspiracy: This is about silencing me. There\u2019s a war on alternative media \u2026 There\u2019s a war where they\u2019re trying to criminalize free speech ... I intend to plead not guilty. I believe I will be vindicated ... The press is not coming out and standing up against this war against free expression. He also said the strategy of the investigation was to \u201cwear Stone down financially, make sure that he\u2019s so broke so he has to plead guilty to these charges ... then try to flip me against the president\u201d. He added: I\u2019m in for the fight of my life. I will not quit. I will not fold. I will not bend ... I\u2019m 66 years old, and I\u2019m essentially broke ... Every dollar I scrape up has to go this fight. For more on the significance of Stone\u2019s arrest, read the analysis from the Guardian\u2019s Tom McCarthy: Yahoo News is reporting that \u201ctwo sources with direct knowledge\u201d of the Vermont senator\u2019s plans say that Bernie Sanders is set to announce that he will run for president in 2020. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, was a frontrunner in the 2016 Democratic primary before ultimately conceding to Hillary Clinton. He gained massive popularity during this time, and remains one of the country\u2019s most well-known politicians. He has a dedicated following, many of whom have been clamoring for \u201cBernie 2020\u201d, but the Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino reports that Sanders \u201crepeatedly stated that he will run again only if he believes he is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d Later Friday, Sanders\u2019 team refuted reports that an announcement was \u201cimminent\u201d and insisted that the senator was still undecided. The Democratic field is already fairly crowded, with eight candidates having announced their bids: Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, California Senator Kamala Harris, former housing secretary Julian Castro, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former tech executive Andrew Yang, and former Maryland Congressman John Delaney. Roger Stone loves former President Richard Nixon enough to get his face tattooed on his back and to strike a Nixon\u2019s famous pose whenever he gets the chance. But the feeling\u2019s not exactly mutual. Multiple US executive branch websites and email servers have been hit in an attack that altered the domain name system records and have redirected and intercepted web and mail traffic, Ars Technica reported Friday. The Department of Homeland Security issued an emergency directive about the attack, directing administrators to audit their public domain name system records, update their passwords, and implement multi-factor authentication for all accounts. According to the directive, the attackers were able to redirect and intercept web and mail traffic by using the following techniques: The attacker begins by compromising user credentials, or obtaining them through alternate means, of an account that can make changes to DNS records. Next, the attacker alters DNS records, like Address (A), Mail Exchanger (MX), or Name Server (NS) records, replacing the legitimate address of a service with an address the attacker controls. This enables them to direct user traffic to their own infrastructure for manipulation or inspection before passing it on to the legitimate service, should they choose. This creates a risk that persists beyond the period of traffic redirection. Because the attacker can set DNS record values, they can also obtain valid encryption certificates for an organization\u2019s domain names. This allows the redirected traffic to be decrypted, exposing any user-submitted data. Since the certificate is valid for the domain, end users receive no error warnings. Roger Stone\u2019s television tour continues. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo named Elliott Abrams as a new special envoy to Venezuela. The move follows President Trump\u2019s decision to recognize the country\u2019s opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, as interim president. Abrams has had a long career in foreign policy. He worked as an assistant secretary of state for human rights and assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs the Reagan administration, at a time US foreign policy in Latin America destabilized the region. Abrams in 1991 admitted to withholding information from Congress about the Iran-Contra affair, in which senior officials in the Reagan administration secretly sold arms to Iran in order to fund the militant group working to overthrow the socialist Nicaraguan government. Abrams was pardoned by President George H.W. Bush in 1992. Abrams was reportedly former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s favored choice to become deputy secretary of state. However, Trump rejected Tillerson\u2019s request over Abrams\u2019 public criticism of Trump\u2019s candidacy. President Trump\u2019s right-wing base reacts to the reopening of the government: Beto O\u2019Rourke is still mulling over whether he wants to throw his hat into an already very crowded ring and run for president in 2020, Politico reports. And the former Texas congressman has no real idea of when he might be ready to make that decision. What\u2019s holding him back right now is family concerns and \u201cexhaustion\u201d from his Texas Senate run, O\u2019Rourke said at a local speaker series in El Paso, Texas. \u201cThere\u2019s an exhaustion after an effort like that, that I\u2019m learning is hard to recover from,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t snap back.\u201d So far, eight major Democrats have entered race: Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, California Senator Kamala Harris, former housing secretary Julian Castro, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former tech executive Andrew Yang, and former Maryland Congressman John Delaney. Hey all, Vivian Ho on the West Coast taking over for Erin Durkin. Well, today has been ... a day. Stay tuned for what happens next. Donald Trump has agreed to reopen the government, signing a bill that will fund agencies for three weeks without the money for a border wall he had demanded. The House and Senate are expected to vote on it today. Trump confidant Roger Stone was released on $250,000 bond, denied working with Russia and declared he would not \u201cbear false witness\u201d by testifying against the president. The House and Senate will vote today on the bill to reopen the government and fund it for three weeks, Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer said. \u201cHopefully now the president has learned his lesson, \u201c Schumer said. Pelosi called it \u201csad\u201d that \u201cit\u2019s taken this long to come to an obvious solution.\u2019\u201d \u201cA disagreement on policy should never be a reason to shut down government,\u201d she said. And the State of the Union speech is not necessarily back on as originally planned for next Tuesday. Pelosi said that once the government is officially open, she and Trump will discuss a mutually agreeable date. Pelosi says her staunch opposition to the wall has not changed. The Republican candidate in the nation\u2019s last undecided congressional election says he\u2019s in the hospital recovering from infections attacking his internal organs, the Associated Press reports: Mark Harris said in a Facebook statement Friday that what he called \u201ca relatively uncommon form of strep bacteria\u201d infected his bloodstream and liver. The post\u2019s authenticity was confirmed by campaign spokesman Jason Williams. Harris said his health scare began more than a week ago with what his doctor initially thought was bronchitis. He says his health is improving with rest and fluids. A reconstituted state elections board is expected to hold a hearing next month into whether Harris narrowly won the 9th Congressional District race in November over Democrat Dan McCready. Officials are investigating allegations that someone connected to Harris\u2019 campaign committed fraud involving mail-in ballots. Senator Lindsey Graham, who three weeks ago said it would be \u201cthe end of his presidency\u201d if Donald Trump signed a government funding bill without wall money, now has a different take. House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff says the committee will send special counsel Robert Mueller full transcripts of all interviews in the committee\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference. Roger Stone, arrested today, was the second person charged with lying to the committee. Donald Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen has pleaded guilty to lying to the Congressional committee. Richard Ojeda of West Virginia has ended his campaign for president just ten days after he quit his seat in the state Senate in order to make a White House run. What could be behind Donald Trump\u2019s sudden willingness to fund the government for a few weeks without money for a border wall? There\u2019s today\u2019s air travel trouble, with flights at three major East Coast airports delayed because of a shortage of air traffic controllers. It\u2019s been called a tipping point in American\u2019s willingness to tolerate the shutdown. Trump might also welcome a change of subject from the indictment of his longtime confidant, Roger Stone. Rep. Mark Meadows, head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, won\u2019t oppose the funding bill, according to NBC News. Right wing commentator Ann Coulter is not pleased with Donald Trump\u2019s decision to re-open the government without the border wall money he demanded. Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell expresses his support for the resolution to re-open the government for three weeks. Here\u2019s Trump\u2019s full speech on ending the government shutdown. Chuck Schumer has just been speaking on the Senate floor. He sounds positive. \u201cI believe there is good faith on both sides\u201d to achieve an agreement, Schumer says. Both House and Senate will be involved. Schumer says Democrats do not think a wall is necessary. But they believe money should be invested in new technology at points of entry. He thanks the federal workers who have gone unpaid. This agreement reopens the government \u201cwithout preconditions\u201d, Schumer says. He says there is a lesson to learn \u2013 that shutting down the government achieves nothing. Border security must be achieved \u201cwithout holding hundreds of thousands of american workers hostage\u201d. Bernie Sanders is rather more direct: Some reaction: \u2022Donald Trump has agreed to reopen the government, without receiving any money for his border wall. It brings to an end a 35-day shutdown which has left hundreds of thousands of federal workers without pay. \u2022Speaking in the White House Rose Garden, Trump said he was \u201cvery proud\u201d to end the 35-day shutdown. But he held out the potential for a national emergency, saying: \u201cI have a very powerful alternative, but I didn\u2019t want to use it at this time.\u201d \u2022Trump said federal workers would receive their backpay. But he seemed unsure on exactly when they would receive it. In a comment unlikely to reassure people who have now missed two paychecks, Trump said workers would be paid \u201cvery quickly, or as soon as possible\u201d. \u2022Trump had insisted he would keep the government closed until he got $5.7bn towards the border wall. Democrats had refused \u2013 and the president caved. He said a barrier \u201cor fence\u201d must be \u201can important part\u201d of any solution, but it is hard to escape the conclusion that for the time being, Trump has caved. We\u2019re into Trump rally territory now. America has \u201cthe strongest economy in the whole world\u201d, Trump says. We have the lowest employment numbers ever. Companies are moving back to the US. But the situation at the border is bad. Drugs and criminals are entering the country. Trump says America is a laughing stock \u201call over the world\u201d. Because of its immigration laws. Trump then volunteers that the situation at the border is also a \u201chealth crisis\u201d, because some of the people entering the US are \u201csick\u201d. That\u2019s not a line I\u2019ve heard before and sounds a little like he just threw it in offhand. The president then discusses duct-taped women, which he has done before. From the Washington Post: Trump keeps mentioning taped-up women at the border. Experts have no idea what he\u2019s talking about. Trump says he has \u201cseen and heard from enough Democrats and Republicans that they are willing to put partnership aside, I think, and put the security of the american people first\u201d. But any suggestions of bipartisanship go out the window as Trump sets off on a hardsell of his much-desired wall. Barriers, or fences, or a wall must be \u201can important part\u201d of any solution, Trump says. The wall, or barrier, will be see-through, he says, which he describes as necessary. (What happened to a big beautiful wall with a big beautiful door?) The president then presents much of the same misinformation he\u2019s been peddling for the past few weeks, referring to undocumented immigrants and drugs coming into the US. As has been made clear repeatedly, the vast majority of both immigrants and drugs come through legal points of entry. Trump strides up to the lectern in the Rose Garden. \u201cI am very proud to announce today that we have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government,\u201d Trump says. Then he references his belief that he can still declare a national emergency to build the border wall (many legal experts disagree): \u201cI have a very powerful alternative, but I didnt want to use it at this time. Hopefully it will be unnecessary.\u201d Trump praises the \u201cextraordinary devotion\u201d of unpaid federal empoyees in the face of \u201cincredible hardship\u201d. The workers are \u201cincredible patriots\u201d, Trump says. He adds of the unpaid workers that \u201cin many cases you encouraged me to keep going because you care so much\u201d about the country and its \u201cborder security\u201d. \u201cIn a short while I will sign a bill to reopen the government,\u201d Trump says. He adds: \u201cI will make sure that all employees receive their backpay very quickly. Or as soon as possible. It\u2019ll happen fast.\u201d Trump is currently running 40 minutes late. His team has gathered though. (Outside, in the cold.) Polling news: 58% of Americans disapprove of Donald Trump\u2019s performance as president, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News survey. According to the poll just 37% of respondents approve of the job Trump is doing, while 53% blame Trump and congressional Republicans for the shutdown. 34% blame Pelosi and Democrats. Our man David Smith is waiting for Donald Trump\u2019s speech at the White House rose garden, where he\u2019s caught a glimpse of Trump\u2019s deputy communications chief. Roger Stone will be back on TV the night of his arrest and indictment. FBI director Christopher Wray, addressing bureau staff in a video, says of the government shutdown: \u201cIt takes a lot to get me angry, but I\u2019m about as angry as I\u2019ve been in a long, long time.\u201d The Washington Post reports that the impending deal will reopen the government for three weeks with no wall money: Congressional leaders, Trump have reached a tentative deal to temporarily reopen the government without wall funds, according to Hill officials. With President Trump\u2019s approval, the pact would reopen the government for three weeks while leaving the issue of $5.7 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall to further talks. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. Trump was expected to announce the deal in a White House ceremony at 1:30 p.m. in the Rose Garden. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders confirms that Donald Trump will make remarks about the shutdown in the Rose Garden at 1:30. CNN cites a senior official as saying he\u2019ll present a \u201cway forward\u201d from the shutdown. The indictment against Roger Stone features some particularly colorful exchanges between Stone and Randy Credico, a comedian, gadfly, and frequent also-ran candidate for office in New York. In text messages last April, Stone told Credico: \u201cYou are a rat. A stoolie. You backstab your friends-run your mouth my lawyers are dying Rip you to shreds.\u201d He also said he would \u201ctake that dog away from you.\u201d The pup in question is Bianca, a 13-year-old Coton de Tulear, who also accompanied Credico to his grand jury testimony. In another exchange, Stone tells Credico to lie to Congress with a reference to The Godfather II, telling him to do a \u201cFrank Pentangeli.\u201d In the film, the character testifies before a congressional committee and claims not to know critical information that he does in fact know. CBS News is reporting that Donald Trump is expected to support a short-term funding bill to reopen the government, without money for a border wall. It may last two or three weeks. The Drudge Report is reporting that an agreement has been reached to end the government shutdown, and an announcement is expected at 1pm. Drudge says that the government will re-open \u201ctemporarily.\u201d Roger Stone has said he will not \u201cbear false witness\u201d against Donald Trump during a news conference outside court. Speaking before a mix of reporters and protestors \u2013 chants of \u201clock him up\u201d could clearly be heard \u2013 Stone said: \u201cThere is no circumstance whatsoever under which I will bear false witness against the president, nor will I make up lies to ease the pressure on myself.\u201d Asked if he worked in any way with the Russians to help Donald Trump win the election, Stone said: \u201cCategorically not, no, absolutely not.\u201d Stone seemed defiant as he walked down the steps of the Fort Lauderdale courthouse, raising his arms aloft and grinning. \u201cAs I have always said the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about,\u201d Stone said. \u201cAfter a two-year inquisition, the charges today relate in no way to Russian collusion.\u201d Stone said he had been \u201cfalsely accused of making false statements\u201d, and said any false statements he may have given were \u201cmade in error\u201d. Recalling his arrest this morning, Stone said: \u201c29 FBI agents arrived at my home in 17 vehicles, with their lights flashing.\u201d He said: \u201cThey terrorised my wife, my dogs\u201d, before adding, rather incongruously, that the FBI agents were \u201cextraordinarily courteous\u201d. Roger Stone has apparently called into InfoWars, the website-cum-radio show of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. The InfoWars website seems to be having some problems, so I couldn\u2019t listen in. But Paul Joseph Watson, InfoWars editor-at-large and noted crank, says Stone told the website: \u201cThis country is literally run by a rogue prosecutor who has more power than the president.\u201d Watson said Stone also expressed fears that the US is turning into the \u201cnew Soviet Union\u201d. ABC\u2019s Ali Dukakis seems to have heard some of Stone\u2019s InfoWars appearance: Of course, Roger Stone wasn\u2019t the only Trump ally appearing in federal court this morning. Around the same time Stone was shuffling into Fort Lauderdale court in chains, Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, was in the US District Court for the District of Columbia in Washington DC. The Guardian\u2019s David Smith was there: His eyes tired and his hair streaked with grey, Paul Manafort looked morose and walked gingerly, with a limp, during his first court appearance in months on Friday. The former Donald Trump campaign chairman, imprisoned in Virginia as he awaits sentencing, wore a suit and was not handcuffed during the hour-long hearing at the US District Court for the District of Columbia in Washington, which focused mainly on procedure. \u201cWe have to figure out what it is I have to decide, when I have to decide it,\u201d Judge Amy Berman Jackson said. At issue, ultimately, is whether Manafort, 69, \u201cintentionally lied\u201d to investigators, including about sharing polling data with a business associate alleged to have ties to Russian intelligence. Lawyers with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s office argue that Manafort breached his plea deal by repeatedly making false statements after he began cooperating with them in September. This is from Guardian reporter Richard Luscombe, who was in court to witness Stone\u2019s appearance this morning: Shackled at the waist and hands, Roger Stone shuffled into federal court in Fort Lauderdale for a 10-minute hearing that ended with his release on bond. His hair still disheveled from his 6am wake up call courtesy of a heavily armed FBI squad, Stone looked a sorry figure dressed in a blue polo shirt and pants. He spoke only briefly, to confirm he understood the conditions of the $250,000 bond that federal magistrate judge Lurana Snow imposed, and to inform the court that he did not currently hold a valid US passport when he was ordered to surrender that and any other travel documents. The seven counts of the indictment were read to him but he was not required to enter a plea. Instead, his next court appearance will be in Washington DC, after he waived his right to a so-called removal hearing in Florida. A large number of protestors gathered outside the courthouse in downtown Fort Lauderdale, some waving \u201cImpeach Trump\u201d placards. Another sign had a picture of Donald Trump with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, and the slogan \u201cPutin won it!\u201d Its owner was playing The Beatles\u2019 song Back in the USSR continuously over a loudspeaker. News coming thick and fast this morning. Stone has just been released on a $250,000 bond. According to CBS Evening News Stone will have travel restrictions \u201cthat would only allow him to travel to court appearances in Florida, Washington DC or New York\u201d. The president speaks: There\u2019s a lot to take in there (border coyotes?) but Trump\u2019s last sentence presumably refers to CNN being present when Stone was arrested this morning. CNN said it was not alerted by officials, but had sent a reporter to Stone\u2019s house after noticing \u201cunusual grand jury activity\u201d, Talking Points Memo reported. Roger Stone has arrived at court in Fort Lauderdale. An official outside the court just told reporters there that Stone will speak outside in 45 minutes to an hour. \u201cHe\u2019s wearing a blue polo, and has disheveled hair,\u201d according to CNN, who add that \u201cthe gallery is overflowing\u201d. A handful of protesters have appeared outside the court. Senator Mark R Warner, the Democratic vice-chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, says Stone\u2019s contacts with WikiLeaks, \u201chappened at least with the full knowledge of, and appear to have been encouraged by, the highest levels of the Trump campaign\u201d. \u201cIt appears Stone also lied to Congress and tampered with witnesses in order to obstruct these investigations into the Trump campaign \u2013 yet another example of senior Trump officials concealing the truth about their Russia-related contacts during the 2016 election,\u201d Warner said in a statement: Roger Stone has been indicted for covering up his engagements with Wikileaks, an organization that U.S. intelligence officials and the Senate Intelligence Committee have publicly designated as a hostile intelligence service, regarding the public release of emails stolen by the Russian government. It is clear from this indictment that those contacts happened at least with the full knowledge of, and appear to have been encouraged by, the highest levels of the Trump campaign. Roger Stone and Donald Trump have known each other for nearly forty years. Mr. Stone played a key role in recruiting Paul Manafort to run the Trump campaign, and he publicly claimed on several occasions to remain in regular contact with then-candidate Trump throughout the 2016 presidential race, even after he formally departed the Trump campaign. It appears Stone also lied to Congress and tampered with witnesses in order to obstruct these investigations into the Trump campaign \u2013 yet another example of senior Trump officials concealing the truth about their Russia-related contacts during the 2016 election. I expect that we will learn more about Mr. Stone\u2019s campaign role, his communications regarding Wikileaks, and who else knew about Stone\u2019s efforts. It remains essential that the Special Counsel be permitted to finish this work without any political interference. This statement is from Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president. Apparently there\u2019s nothing to see here: \u201cThe indictment today does not allege Russian collusion by Roger Stone or anyone else. Rather, the indictment focuses on alleged false statements made to Congress.\u201d Staff shortages are also causing delays at Philadelphia and Newark airports, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA website says there is a minimum one hour delay at both airports. I just called the FAA press office but got this message: \u201cDue to the lapse in federal funding we are unable to respond to your call.\u201d The FAA gave this statement to CNBC: Air control traffic staffing issues, likely caused by the government shutdown, are causing delays at New York\u2019s LaGuardia airport this morning. The Federal Aviation Administration says the airport is experiencing ground delays and departure delays due to what it says are \u201cstaffing\u201d problems. A lack of TSA officers, credited to the shutdown, had already caused some airports have already been forced to close terminals. CNBC first reported that the FAA was \u201chalting\u201d flights into LaGuardia. The Guardian is trying to confirm this. Nancy Pelosi speaks! Per the Washington Post\u2019s Mike DeBonis. Paul Manafort has arrived in court in Washington DC, according to our reporter on the scene. US district judge Amy Berman Jackson will be presiding, we\u2019ll have news as it develops. Robert Mueller has alleged Manafort continued to lie to investigators after agreeing a plea deal. Donald Trump representative Rudy Giuliani has downplayed the Stone arrest in an interview with the Washington Post. The former mayor and current bungler has told other outlets that Trump\u2019s lawyers will be releasing a statement soon. https://twitter.com/costareports/status/1088802539011743746 Meanwhile, in Fox News world: Donald Trump hasn\u2019t tweeted yet this morning, which is rare. But Trump posted this back in December. We might soon find out if it holds true. \u2022 Roger Stone, a longtime Donald Trump ally, has been charged with obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. \u2022 The indictment alleges that Stone spoke to senior Trump campaign officials about WikiLeaks \u201cand information it might have had that would be damaging to the [Hillary] Clinton campaign\u201d. \u2022 In a worrying development for Trump, the president could potentially be implicated in Stone\u2019s alleged crimes. The indictment describes a senior Trump campaign official as being \u201cdirected\u201d to contact Stone regarding releases damaging to the Clinton campaign. The accusation begs the question as to who in the Trump campaign could have directed the unnamed senior official. \u2022 Stone was arrested by FBI agents at his Fort Lauderdale, Florida, home at around 6am on Friday morning. CNN footage showed a number of armed agents approaching the house. Stone is due to appear in court at 11am. \u2022 In a separate development Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, is due to appear in a Washington DC court today. Manafort will face accusations that he lied to Mueller after agreeing to cooperate with the special counsel\u2019s office. The Stone indictment potentially implicates Donald Trump in Russian collusion. The indictment describes a senior Trump campaign official being \u201cdirected\u201d to contact Stone regarding releases damaging to the Clinton campaign: After the July 22, 2016 release of stolen DNC emails by Organization 1, a senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact STONE about any additional releases. That prompts the question as to who in the Trump campaign could have directed the unnamed senior official. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders has just been interviewed on CNN, where she refused to answer questions if Trump was the person doing the directing. \u201cThe charges brought against Mr Stone have nothing to do with the president,\u201d is all Sanders would say. This is from MSNBC journalist Kyle Griffin. The Stone indictment alleges that Stone communicated with \u201csenior Trump campaign officials\u201d regarding \u201cOrganization 1\u201d \u2013 widely acknowledged to be WikiLeaks. Stone discussed the information Organization 1 \u201cmight have had that would be damaging to the Clinton Campaign\u201d with Trump campaign officials, according to Robert Mueller. So the day hasn\u2019t started well for Donald Trump. But it could get worse. Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, is also due in court later on. Manafort will face accusations in Washington DC that he lied to Robert Mueller after agreeing to cooperate with the special counsel\u2019s office. The former Trump campaign official is already incarcerated, but if US district judge Amy Bermanan Jackson finds that Manafort has violated his plea deal, the former Trump campaign official could face a longer sentence. In December Mueller alleged in court that Manafort \u201clied to the FBI and to the special counsel\u2019s office on five different matters after entering an agreement to cooperate with prosecutors\u201d. \u201cMueller, arrest me!\u201d Be careful what you wish for... The Netflix documentary Get Me Roger Stone caused quite a splash when it aired in 2017. The film examined Stone\u2019s pervasive influence in Republican politics over several decades. The Guardian\u2019s Gwilym Mumford reviewed the film at the time: Stone has had a perma-tanned hand in just about every nefarious deed carried out by the forces of the American conservative movement in the past half century, from Watergate right up to the election of perhaps the least qualified man in history to hold the office of US president. He also practically invented the modern political attack ad and engaged in the dirtiest of dirty tricks. There\u2019s a reason Stone has the acquired the eye-opening nickname, \u201cRatfucker\u201d. Among the revelations: Stone has a Nixon tattoo on his upper back. In an early morning exclusive, CNN were already outside Roger Stone\u2019s house in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when FBI agents arrived. A reporter on the scene said on air that there had been some unexpected grand jury activity relating to Stone in Washington DC, yesterday. A so-called grand jury is often convened in big cases in the US, typically of 23 people selected to hear evidence in camera and examine the strength of allegations against a suspect or suspects before a case proceeds to trial. The cable news channel had personnel at the house in the pre-dawn hours when a large team of FBI agents arrived and fanned out silently across the lawn in front of Stone\u2019s house. After they banged on the front door, a light went on upstairs and after some moments, Stone appeared at the door. He was apparently dressed in some form of \u201csleepwear\u201d, according to the CNN team on the ground, although he was partially obscured by armed and armored agents swarming the home. He was wearing glasses and upon being asked: \u201cAre you Roger Stone?\u201d he affirmed that he was. He surrendered calmly to the FBI and was taken away. Here\u2019s exclusive footage from CNN showing FBI agents arriving to arrest Stone. An agent can be heard banging on the door and shouting: \u201cIt\u2019s FBI. Open the door.\u201d Politico\u2019s Kyle Cheney is tweeting some of the most damning accusations from Stone\u2019s indictment. Randy Credico is a New York radio host and long-time Stone associate. In November Credico\u2019s attorney told the Daily Beast that Credico had already met with the special counsel\u2019s team \u201ca number of times.\u201d This is the business-like press release sent from the special counsel\u2019s office to reporters on Friday. \u201cRoger Jason Stone, Jr, 66, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was arrested in Fort Lauderdale today following an indictment by a federal grand jury on Jan. 24, 2019, in the District of Columbia,\u201d the statement reads. The Guardian\u2019s Jon Swaine has been covering the Russia collusion inquiry and sends this background on Stone\u2019s situation. Stone, 66, has been a friend of Trump\u2019s for decades and served as an informal adviser to the president\u2019s successful campaign for the White House. He was also involved in creating campaign groups that supported Trump\u2019s bid with outside spending. He confirmed he exchanged messages during the 2016 campaign with \u201cGuccifer 2.0\u201d, who publicly purported to be an independent hacker. Mueller\u2019s team alleges that Guccifer was in fact a front for Russian intelligence officers who stole and leaked emails from senior Democrats, throwing the party into turmoil at the height of the 2016 campaign. Several times during July 2016, Stone said Russia was probably behind the email hacking operation, before abruptly denying this was the case. Stone also claimed to have met Julian Assange, who published the Democratic emails through his website WikiLeaks, but later backtracked. CNN had reporters outside Stone\u2019s house when he was arrested. It appears to have been quite a scene, with officers carrying \u201cheavy weapons\u201d descending on the Fort Lauderdale property. A number of law enforcement vehicles with silent sirens flashing pulled in front of Stone\u2019s home on a darkened Fort Lauderdale street just after 6 am. Friday morning. About a dozen officers with heavy weapons and tactical vests fanned out across Stone\u2019s lawn. Law enforcement shined a flashlight into Stone\u2019s front door before one officer rapped against it, shouting, \u201cFBI. Open the door.\u201d Seconds later, the agent shouted, \u201cFBI. Warrant.\u201d A floor light turned on and moments later, Stone appeared in the front entryway. He confirmed who he was to law enforcement. Roger Stone, a longtime ally of Donald Trump, has been arrested on seven charges, special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019 office has announced. The charges include witness tampering, obstruction and giving false testimony, according to the indictment. Stone was indicted by a grand jury on Thursday, and arrested at his Fort Lauderdale home at 6am on Friday morning, his lawyer told CNN. The 23-page indictment, signed by Mueller, alleges that Stone was in contact with a senior Trump campaign official regarding the WikiLeaks release of Clinton campaign emails. Separately, Mueller says that from May 2017 \u201cthrough at least December 2017\u201d, Stone \u201ccorruptly influenced, obstructed, impeded, and endeavored to influence, obstruct, and impede\u201d congressional inquiries. Stone is due in federal court in Fort Lauderdale at 11am on Friday. Follow the latest developments here.",

      "body": "<p>Social media campaigning will be heavily restricted in the upcoming Thai election, in a move political parties claim will gag freedom of expression and directly affect younger voters.</p> <p>Following the confirmation that Thailand\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/23/thailand-marks-stilted-return-to-democracy-with-march-election\">much-postponed election would finally be held on 24 March</a> \u2013 the first election since the military seized power in a bloodless coup in 2014 \u2013 the election commission released strict guidelines on political campaigning.</p> <p>The commission particularly targeted social media in the new rules, banning posts that contained anything other than candidates\u2019 names, pictures and biographies, and the party name, logo policies and slogans.

Following the confirmation that Thailand\u2019s much-postponed election would finally be held on 24 March \u2013 the first election since the military seized power in a bloodless coup in 2014 \u2013 the election commission released strict guidelines on political campaigning. The commission particularly targeted social media in the new rules, banning posts that contained anything other than candidates\u2019 names, pictures and biographies, and the party name, logo policies and slogans. The rules were seen to target newer progressive parties that rely heavily on social media to spread their message. The new social media campaigning restrictions are an apparent extension of Thailand\u2019s already draconian computer crimes law, where people can be arrested simply for sharing a piece of content deemed critical or damaging by the authorities, and which over the past five years has been used to stifle freedom of expression under the military regime. Parties have also been instructed not to \u201clike\u201d posts that violate any of these rules, spread \u201cfalse information\u201d or defame other candidates and parties in any way. All parties also have to register any social media channels with the election commission or face heavy fines and jail time. A special committee has also been set up by the election commission solely to monitor online campaigning and political discussion in the build-up to the election, leading many to question how free and fair campaigning will be. Future Forward is one of the new progressive political parties that claim to speak for the younger generation of Thais and use social media as a key part of their strategy for reaching out to voters. It has condemned the social media restrictions as \u201cambiguous and confusing\u201d. Future Forward party spokeswoman Pannika Wanich said: \u201cWhen speaking of the youth, this definitely affects their political engagement and awareness. Without a doubt social media has been the main platform for communication and access of information during this period. \u201cThese legal terms restrict not only freedom of expression but most importantly voters\u2019 rights to information, which are the main principles of democracy in regard to conducting free and fair elections. The question is who actually benefits from these limitations? Definitely not the people.\u201d Hours after the rules were announced, Sudarat Keyuraphan, head of election strategy for the Pheu Thai party and its possible candidate for prime minister, deactivated her Facebook account in an apparent move to avoid any violations. She was followed by several other political candidates. Chaturon Chaisang, an advisor in the Thai Raksa party, claimed the social media restrictions were a futile and outdated move by the election commission. \u201cThis is due to the fact the election commission does not understand the term \u2018freedom\u2019,\u201d he said on his Facebook page. \u201cBut there\u2019s no way they can block it. The social media world has gone far ahead. The election commission can\u2019t catch up with it.\u201d The announcement of the election rules has, for many, confirmed the fears that the military junta would try to retain strict control over the messaging of the election, and that even with the ban on political campaigning lifted, freedom of expression, particularly freedom to criticise the junta, would be limited. Last year the Computer Crimes Act was used to target Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, the leader of Future Forward. Police charged him with spreading \u201cfalse\u201d information about the ruling junta in a Facebook Live broadcast \u2013 charges he denied. In addition, the military has formed its own political party to run in the election and the new constitution heavily skews the parliamentary system in its favour, leading many to predict the election will do little to unseat the power of the military.",
