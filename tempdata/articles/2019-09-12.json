These include the market system, but they also include cultural norms and the ways in which power and wealth are distributed inside and outside the market. At present, the rules governing employment are largely set by financial logic. This is inimical to a civilised reduction in hours. There is therefore a strong argument for setting up countervailing institutions to \u2018nudge\u2019 society in a direction which science and technology makes possible, and which is also desired by most people. A balance will need to be struck between what workers want from employment and what employers can afford to give.

She was on the Today programme this morning, and here are some other points she made.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Rudd claimed the Tories could face challenges from up to 20 candidates standing at the next election as independent Conservatives.</strong> She said there were 22 former Tories in the party who do not take the party whip (the 21 who had the whip removed last week after rebelling over Brexit, and Rudd herself, who resigned the whip at the weekend). She said she had been \u201cstruck by how effectively they [the 21] are organised as a group\u201d and she said she hoped No 10 would agree to restore the whip to all of them. She would like to be able to retake the whip herself, she said, but it would depend on how others were treated. Asked what she would do at the election, she said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I am a Conservative, and if it comes to a general election in the short term, although of course none of us know when that might be, if I\u2019m not back with the Conservative whip then I\u2019m likely to fight as an independent Conservative. And I\u2019m looking at options at the moment \u2026</p> \n   <p>I will not be fighting for another party. I hope to be fighting as a Conservative and, if not, with up to 20 people, as an independent Conservative, depending on whether the whip has been returned. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Rudd has already made it clear she will be looking for a new constituency because she will not stand again in Hastings and Rye, where she had a majority of just 346 over Labour at the previous election.</p> \n  <p>She did not explain why she thought up to 20 people might be standing as independent Conservatives. Of the 21 Tories who lost the whip, almost half have said they <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/full-list-of-mps-who-are-standing-down-at-the-next-election-a4230531.html\">intend to stand down at the next election.</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said people still in cabinet should \u201cspeak out\u201d if they are worried about what Boris Johnson is doing.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said Johnson\u2019s confrontational approach to parliament was \u201ca mistake\u201d.</strong> Theresa May considered proroguing parliament to help pass Brexit, but rejected the idea, May said. Asked about the current prorogation, she said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I am surprised, and I think it is a very un-Conservative thing to be doing. I have sat in three cabinets under three different prime ministers, and this level of confrontation with parliament I have never seen before. </p> \n   <p>Under Theresa May we did briefly look at the idea of prorogation. It was dismissed because we knew it would be the wrong approach, the wrong way to treat a parliament full of representatives of their own communities. </p> \n   <p>And this level of confrontation, I think, is unwelcome. I think it is a mistake. I think, as politicians and Conservatives, we should be looking to find the compromise and using persuasion and intelligence to try and find that compromise.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c358249e1b359db38086baa40bc368d62a70915\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c358249e1b359db38086baa40bc368d62a70915/0_17_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amber Rudd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amber Rudd.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T09:21:16.283Z\">at 10.21am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d79f6648f083106f455a0ea\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T08:22:17.100Z\">9.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ministers have taken 'considerable steps' to avert no-deal Brexit dangers in report, says Gove</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Quite late last night, the government finally published the Operation Yellowhammer document about what might happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now, so here\u2019s a summary of the evening\u2019s events. Three judges accused the prime minister of misleading the electorate. The Scottish appeal judges who ruled Boris Johnson unlawfully prorogued parliament agreed that he did so to prevent proper scrutiny of his Brexit strategy, not for the reasons the government has given. The law requiring the prime minister to ask for a Brexit delay is just as important as that which outlaws bank robbery, the Commons Speaker has stressed. John Bercow said that, whatever the perceived political importance of leaving the EU quickly, the prime minister would be no more justified in ignoring the law than would be a bank robber who promised to hand their loot to charity after the deed. \u201cNot obeying the law must surely be a non-starter. Period,\u201d he told an audience of lawyers. The UK should consider drawing up a codified constitution, Bercow added. The Speaker said parliament had succeeded in reasserting its authority over the executive in recent years, but that a codified constitution might be required for it to complete that work. You can see a round-up of the day\u2019s earlier events here. And, for those wishing to read yet more, my colleagues Rowena Mason and Owen Bowcott have the full story: The three Scottish appeal judges who ruled Boris Johnson had unlawfully prorogued parliament have bluntly accused the prime minister of misleading voters on his true reasons for suspending parliament. They agree unanimously it was to prevent proper scrutiny of his Brexit strategy \u2013 and for no other reason \u2013 in their official rulings issued by the Scottish courts late on Thursday afternoon. Read the judges\u2019 opinion in full here (pdf). Lord Carloway, the lord president, said prorogation was sought \u201cin a clandestine manner\u201d when Downing Street knew 75 MPs and peers were taking the government to court to block it. No 10 also did this knowing prorogation would stymie debate about Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans and then gave the court no clear reason to justify prorogation, as well as the five-week period Johnson got from the Queen, which they described as an \u201cextraordinary length of time.\u201d Carloway said: The circumstances demonstrate that the true reason for the prorogation is to reduce the time available for parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit at a time when such scrutiny would appear to be a matter of considerable importance, given the issues at stake. [Put] shortly, prorogation was being mooted specifically as a means to stymie any further legislation regulating Brexit. Lord Drummond Young is particularly blunt, arguing that the UK government\u2019s failure to provide the Scottish court with any valid reasons for proroguing Westminster for five weeks supported their conclusions it was unjustified. If no reason is given, in the present circumstances, I am of opinion that the decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks out of the seven remaining before the United Kingdom is scheduled to leave the European Union leads inevitably to the conclusion that the reason for prorogation was to prevent parliamentary scrutiny of the government. I find it impossible to see that it could serve any other rational purpose. Lord Brodie, the third judge, said that, despite the weight courts need to give to the royal prerogative and a government\u2019s right to use procedures to suit its purposes, this was an \u201cegregious\u201d case of misuse of prorogation. Procedural manoeuvres are the stuff of politics, whether conducted in parliament or in lesser bodies. However, when the manoeuvre is quite so blatantly designed \u2018to frustrate parliament\u2019 at such a critical juncture in the history of the United Kingdom, I consider that the court may legitimately find it to be unlawful. Bercow draws his address to a close, saying that the evolution and renaissance of parliament has been a positive development in the last decade. Now, he adds, it is \u201ctime to ask whether a written constitution is what we need to allow us to complete the voyage\u201d. He says he was previously sceptical but has come to conclude that it\u2019s worth establishing a royal commission or a Speaker\u2019s conference to look into the idea. Bercow says an act could be passed in the interim to make sure parliament\u2019s authority is ensured. The Speaker turns to the question of a codified constitution, saying the UK\u2019s in a group of only three nations not to have one. He says the UK has been \u201ctravelling in the direction\u201d of such a constitution. Concerned he has sat too long on the fence, Bercow adds: Let me make myself crystal clear: Ladies and gentlemen, the only form of Brexit which we will have, whenever that might be, will be a Brexit that the House of Commons has explicitly endorsed. The Speaker has issued a stinging rebuke to those who support the idea of the prime minister, Boris Johnson, refusing to ask Brussels for a delay to Brexit \u2013 as the law requires. Not obeying the law must surely be a non-starter. Period. Surely, in 2019, in modern Britain, in a parliamentary democracy, we \u2013 parliamentarians, legislators \u2013 cannot in all conscience be conducting a debate as to whether adherence to the law is or isn\u2019t required. What conceivable moral force do the public\u2019s elected representatives have in seeking to tackle antisocial behaviour, in prosecuting with greater vigour and imagination and relentlessness the fight against knife crime, in arguing that the state must protect itself against all sorts of nefarious illegality, if we are to treat for a moment with the proposition that it might be in order, in the name of some higher cause, to disregard a law enacted by parliament? It is astonishing that anyone has even entertained the notion ... It would be the most terrible example to set to the rest of society. One should no more refuse to request an extension of article 50 because of what one might regard as the noble end of departing from the EU as soon as possible than one could possibly excuse robbing a bank on the basis that the cash stolen would be donated to a charitable cause immediately afterwards. What comes next, Bercow asks? Only three plausible possibilities: A new withdrawal agreement and political declaration that will require \u201cheavy lifting\u201d by parliament if it appears it could command a majority. No new agreement, or one the Commons cannot not accept, and a vote by MPs for a no-deal Brexit. He says such a deliberate action \u2013 as opposed to \u201csomething coming about by default or happenstance\u201d would be legitimate. Neither support for an agreement, nor a no-deal Brexit, meaning the prime minister has to ask for an extension. \u201cThis is clearly legitimate,\u201d he says, adding that, while there may be people who disagree with the move, it is \u2013 in procedural terms \u2013 he says that the Benn act is \u201corderly\u201d. \u201cThe Brexit episode and the restoration of parliamentary will should not be seen in isolation,\u201d Bercow, says, in conclusion. Moreover, Bercow stresses the importance of the backbench business committee in making sure issues that are not necessarily a priority for the government or the opposition are brought to the attention of the Commons. One example he cites is the Hillsborough disaster, which was debated in the Commons after being scheduled by the backbench business committee. Another device Bercow says has become important is the emergency debate, which MPs used last week to begin the process of trying to rule out a no-deal Brexit. He explains that the instrument gives MPs the chance to, in effect, take control of the agenda of the Commons away from the executive, should a majority of the house wish to do so. The increasing use of such instruments, he claims, has been key to the Commons getting \u201coff its knees\u201d and providing more effective scrutiny of the government on behalf of the electorate. Meanwhile, three Scottish appeal court judges have refused to order the publication of the unredacted No 10 memos in the case against Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation of parliament: Turning to his first point, Bercow says there has been a renewal of the Commons\u2019 desire to and confidence in its ability to scrutinise ministers. Principal in that process, he says, has been the increasing use of an old device: the urgent question. This allows any MP to ask the Speaker to get a minister to respond to the issue, where it\u2019s deemed important and wouldn\u2019t normally form part of the day\u2019s parliamentary business. The urgent question, Bercow says, had \u201cwithered away\u201d in recent times. Only two were laid in the 12 months before he was elected to be Speaker. That, he says, was something he had decided to try to change, if given the role. And, in the roughly 10 years he\u2019s fulfilled it, Bercow says there have been 658 urgent questions. Bercow begins by calling the most recent spell in the Commons short, yet extremely eventful. And he pays tribute to Tom Bingham, the eminent British judge for whom the lecture the Speaker is delivering is named. He says he will cover three topics: That the revival of the Commons is not the one-off product of Brexit, but part of a wider renewal of the UK\u2019s legislature. To offer some reflections on what would and would not be an appropriate response to the recent vote to back an anti-no-deal act. To offer thoughts on how Brexit has changed his view of the UK\u2019s constitution and whether it\u2019s time to consider codifying a constitution. The outgoing Commons Speaker, John Bercow, is due to deliver a speech to the legal thinktank, the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law, entitled: Process of Discovery: What Brexit has taught us (so far) about Parliament, Politics and the UK Constitution. He\u2019s due to start any moment and we\u2019ll be covering it here. Boris Johnson has said it is \u201cabsolutely not true\u201d that he misled the Queen over his reasons for suspending parliament, after a Scottish court ruled his suspension unlawful because he did it to stop MPs scrutinising Brexit. Michel Barnier has told MEPs there remain insufficient grounds for reopening formal negotiations over the Brexit withdrawal agreement, six months after Theresa May and the European commission closed them. The high court in Belfast has dismissed claims that a no-deal Brexit and the imposition of a hard border would damage the Northern Ireland peace process. Gordon Brown, the Labour former prime minister, has said that the government is \u201cstill not telling the truth\u201d about medicine and food shortages that would result in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Before a speech in Edinburgh, Brown said: The truth is that we are not taking back control but losing control - of medical supplies and food and energy prices. The worst-case scenario document downplays the risks to medical supplies, the threat to household budgets and the damage inflicted on the most vulnerable. We now know from Yellowhammer that no-deal Brexit is an unnecessary act of self-harm but ministers are still not telling the truth about the sheer scale of the self-inflicted wounds. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has welcomed a report proposing a new financial transaction tax that would raise \u00a32.1bn a year. The plan is set out in Intelligence Capital\u2019s report Reinforcing Resilience: Making the UK a Citadel of Long-Term Finance (pdf). McDonnell said Labour would carefully consider its recommendations. He said: We need to move beyond a world dominated by fast finance. This report presents one way to achieve that: through a comprehensive financial transactions tax that doesn\u2019t leave loopholes for major areas of financial activity. The report shows that a comprehensive financial transactions tax can raise revenue for our under-resourced public services, improve the resilience of financial markets, and ensure that finance serves the people and the wider economy. Anti-Brexit campaigners have filed a legal challenge in the Scottish courts in an effort to compel Boris Johnson to seek an extension to article 50. The owner of Rosyth dockyard in Fife has been named by Boris Johnson as the preferred bidder for a \u00a31.25bn contract to build five new frigates, a step in a plan to increase the number of warships in the Royal Navy over the next two decades. Fresh fruit and vegetables and wine are among the products likely to become scarcer and more expensive after a no-deal Brexit, according to a flurry of warnings issued by retailers and the alcoholic drinks industry. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. My colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels is less optimistic about the prospect of a Brexit deal than Charles Grant. (See 4.34pm.) Here is a Twitter thread with her analysis of where we are. The Labour MP Emma Lewell-Buck has told ITV\u2019s Acting Prime Minister podcast that she would rather go into coalition with the Brexit party than with the Lib Dems. That is not because of any affection for the Brexit party - she says she despises them - but because she could not accept a coalition with a party committed to revoking article 50. Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, is always worth reading on Brexit. Here is a Twitter thread with his assessment of the latest state of play. Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg, said today that there was no reason for the EU to grant the UK another Brexit extension. He said: We see no extension for Brexit, when there is no reason to. At the moment, there is no reason to give an extension. When there are concrete reasons ... we will discuss whether we will give a new mandate or a new extension, but that is not the case at the moment. As long as there aren\u2019t any concrete proposals, there is no reason for us to reopen anything. Bettel\u2019s comments reflect the current state of play. In practice it is widely assumed that at the EU summit starting on 17 October EU leaders probably would be willing to agree to another extension, particularly to enable a general election. Antoinette Sandbach, one of the 21 pro-European Tories who lost the whip after rebelling against the government on Brexit last week, has said that she is now fully committed to the idea of holding a second referendum. In an open letter to constituents, she says this was necessary to \u201cavert disaster\u201d. Here is a question from below the line. The \u201chumble address\u201d requiring the government to hand over private messages from Number 10 aides about prorogation was not law. Effectively it was an order from parliament, and it is for parliament to apply a sanction. Last year, when the government refused to comply with a \u201chumble address\u201d demanding the release of the attorney general\u2019s legal advice to cabinet about the withdrawal agreement, MPs retaliated by passing a motion saying the government was in contempt of parliament. The government then agreed to hand over the document. MPs may well try the same tactic this time. But Boris Johnson is likely to be less bothered about being found in contempt of parliament than Theresa May (his de facto chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, did not seem to care about being found in contempt of parliament on another matter earlier this year). It is possible Johnson would just ignore the vote. At that point, parliament starts running out of options. There is nothing it can do about non-MPs found in contempt of parliament. The Commons can refer individual members to the standards committee, and that committee can recommend punishments such as suspension, or even expulsion, but it is very, very hard to imagine the Commons voting to act like that against a prime minister. These are from the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming in Brussels. Nicola Sturgeon has said the Scottish government\u2019s copy of the Yellowhammer no-deal Brexit scenario plans was marked \u201cbase scenario\u201d, disputing claims by Michael Gove that the documents were a worst-case scenario. Sturgeon told first minister\u2019s questions at Holyrood it was \u201ccompletely outrageous\u201d that the UK government was contemplating a situation where medicines would be in short supply. She said it was essential that Westminster was urgently reconvened, to allow MPs to question ministers on Brexit and the Yellowhammer forecasts. The first minister told MSPs: The question for the prime minister and the government is why on earth parliament is still suspended - if any government needed scrutiny, it\u2019s this one. Earlier this week my colleague Peter Walker reported on how data privacy campaign groups and Labour have expressed alarm after it emerged Downing Street had ordered departments to centralise the collection and analysis of user information from the government\u2019s main public information website ahead of Brexit. Here is is story. Today the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office has suggested it is seeking assurances about this initiative. Boris Johnson has revived his plan to build a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland - saying that it would be a \u201cvery good\u201d idea and that it would cost \u00a315bn. Speaking to children during his visit to lighthouse tender NLV Pharos on the Thames, Johnson said he had recently been discussing the possibility of constructing a bridge over the Irish Sea. He said: [I was talking yesterday] about building a bridge from Stranraer in Scotland to Larne in Northern Ireland \u2013 that would be very good. It would only cost about \u00a315bn. Johnson originally floated this idea in an interview with the Sunday Times last year. At the time his proposal was considered fanciful, but this week Channel 4 News revealed that government officials have been asked to produce a paper on the costs and benefits of such a plan. The original Sunday Times story about Johnson\u2019s proposal provoked a memorable letter to the paper from a retired offshore engineer who said the idea was \u201cabout as feasible as building a bridge to the moon\u201d. Here is our latest story on the judgment from the high court in Belfast on Brexit. I\u2019ve corrected the earlier post on this (see 11.38am) because it said the prorogation legal challenge was thrown out. In fact, it was the argument that a no-deal Brexit would undermine the Good Friday agreement that was rejected. A claim about prorogation being unlawful was excluded on the grounds that it is being decided in the cases in England and Wales. And here is the full text of the judgment (pdf). The Commons public accounts committee has published a report (pdf) this morning accusing the government of being \u201coverly secretive\u201d about the money it is spending on consultants who are helping it prepare for Brexit. The bill has come to at least \u00a397m, the committee says. Here is an extract. Departments have made extensive use of consultancy firms in support of their preparations for Brexit, spending at least \u00a397m by April 2019. Departments have been overly secretive about what the consultants are doing, as they have been before in providing information on other aspects of the Brexit preparations. When departments have published information on consultancy work, usually later than they should have, they have failed to meet the government\u2019s own transparency standards. Departments took too long to publish information on the contracts being let, and some contracts were over-zealously redacted before publication. And talking of MPs frustrating a no-deal Brexit, Sir Oliver Letwin, one of the MPs who helped to draw up the bill intended to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, has given an interview to the Evening Standard in which he suggested that MPs might pass another law to hold a referendum on Brexit before a general election. Tony Blair, the former Labour leader, and Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, have both argued this week (see here and here) that it would be better to hold a referendum before a general election because otherwise the general election would end up as a proxy referendum on Brexit, with domestic issues sidelined. Blair has also argued that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s unpopularity could boost the chances of the Tories winning even though voters have doubts about Boris Johnson\u2019s hard-Brexit strategy. Labour wants to hold a general election first, which makes it very hard to see how any backbench attempt to seize control of the Commons order paper and pass legislation saying a referendum should come first would succeed. The Hilary Benn bill designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October only passed the Commons because all opposition parties (except for the DUP, if you count them as opposition) voted for it. In his interview with the Standard Letwin did not explain why he thought Corbyn might change his stance on this. But Letwin did claim that MPs would come round to his view that it would be best to have a referendum first, assuming Johnson did not get a deal that could pass the Commons. Here is an extract from the interview. [Letwin] would definitely oppose trying to decide Brexit in the hurly-burly of a general election campaign. And he is pretty sure MPs are ready to keep postponing the election until after Brexit is decided. \u201cI can\u2019t see how you can do that [resolve Brexit] very well in a general election where it will get, as Alan Duncan said in a marvellous speech this week, all muddled up in other things,\u201d he said. Was he in agreement with Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, who yesterday called for a referendum to be held before the election? Sir Oliver replied: \u201cWe need to resolve this issue of Brexit before there is a general election so that the election can be about who you want to have govern you, and so the resolution of the Brexit issue is separate. I would prefer that and, like Tom, I would prefer that to be done through the acceptance of a deal in parliament.\u201d And where would that leave the prime minister\u2019s plea for an immediate general election with Brexit on the ballot paper? Sir Oliver replied in a musing tone: \u201cI\u2019ve heard all sorts of predictions of the election timing \u2013 next week, next minute, next day \u2013 but I have never been confident they were right because I think we will get a majority in the House of Commons who agree with the view that I take, which is that it is better to get the Brexit issues resolved first and have an election after. \u201cThat means either you get a deal and get it in place, which is relatively quick, or you have a deal followed by a referendum, which is relatively long.\u201d In his broadcast interview this morning Boris Johnson claimed that the government\u2019s position on prorogation had been endorsed by the high court in London. (See 10.50am.) It is worth stressing that that is a very partial account of what the high court actually said. It rejected the claim that prorogation was unlawful. But it did not accept Johnson\u2019s argument that his decision to prorogue had nothing to do with wanting to limit the opportunities for MPs to frustrate a no-deal Brexit. The court did not take a view on this at all. Instead it rejected the legal challenge on the grounds that decisions to prorogue parliament are inherently political, and therefore outside the scope of the courts. There is a short summary of what it argued here, and the full summary is here (pdf). Here is more from the ruling in the Belfast high court rejecting a challenge to the government\u2019s Brexit strategy. In his written judgment Lord Justice Bernard McCloskey said: I consider the characterisation of the subject matter of these proceedings as inherently and unmistakably political to be beyond plausible dispute. Virtually all of the assembled evidence belongs to the world of politics, both national and supra-national. Within the world of politics the well-recognised phenomena of claim and counterclaim, assertion and counter-assertion, allegation and denial, blow and counter-blow, alteration and modification of government policy, public statements, unpublished deliberations, posturing, strategy and tactics are the very essence of what is both countenanced and permitted in a democratic society. In the past John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has floated the idea of moving towards a four-day working week. He commissioned the distinguished economist Lord Skidelsky to produce a report for Labour on reducing working time and today the 60-page report (pdf) has been published. Entitled How to achieve shorter working hours, it is a long way from a blueprint for a full roll-out to a standard four-day working week. But it does propose various mechanisms that could nudge employers in that direction. Here is an extract from the conclusions: Individuals choose how much to work but within the limits set by the institutions of a particular society. These include the market system, but they also include cultural norms and the ways in which power and wealth are distributed inside and outside the market. At present, the rules governing employment are largely set by financial logic. This is inimical to a civilised reduction in hours. There is therefore a strong argument for setting up countervailing institutions to \u2018nudge\u2019 society in a direction which science and technology makes possible, and which is also desired by most people. A balance will need to be struck between what workers want from employment and what employers can afford to give. The game can be played for lower stakes than at present, but the stakes must not be so low as to bankrupt an economy, which still largely relies on private enterprise to \u2018deliver the goods\u2019. Commenting on the report, McDonnell said: Something is very wrong with how the world of work has changed in recent years. Millions are working long hours, while others don\u2019t get the regular hours they need. I\u2019d like to thank Lord Skidelsky for his meticulously researched report which we will study and draw on when looking at how we can reduce the typical working week without loss of pay. Labour said it was particularly interested in three of Skidelsky\u2019s recommendations: setting up social partnership forums for different sectors of the economy; using state procurement policies to set conditions for pay and working hours in private firms (which would not be eligible for contracts if they did not comply); and ending the opt-out from the EU working time directive. David Sassoli, the new president of the European parliament, has been holding a press conference. He said that any Brexit agreement would have to have a backstop, that the UK had not yet proposed any credible alternative, and that the European parliament would be open to a Brexit delay if the UK was going to hold an election. These are from my colleague Jennifer Rankin, the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge and ITV\u2019s James Mates. It is 2-1 to the government in the courts now on Brexit. As my colleague Owen Bowcott reports, judges in Belfast have rejected a legal challenge arguing that the government\u2019s Brexit policy would undermine the peace process. It has also shelved a challenge on prorogation, on the grounds that this is being dealt with by the courts in England and Wales. The supreme court will come to a final, binding ruling after a hearing starting on Tuesday next week. Here is Owen\u2019s story: UPDATE: I\u2019ve corrected this post because the high court in Belfast rejected the claim that the government\u2019s Brexit policy would undermine the Good Friday agreement. It also considered a challenge against prorogation, but it excluded this on the grounds that it is being dealt with by the cases in England and Wales. Boris Johnson has given a pooled interview for broadcasters. I have already covered his comments denying that he lied to the Queen. (See 10.50am.) Here are the other lines from the interview. Johnson refused to back the views of the business minister Kwasi Kwarteng, who aired concerns last night that judges were seen as biased. Asked if he considered the judiciary to be independent, Johnson said: I think the British judiciary, the United Kingdom judiciary, is one of the great glories of our constitution \u2013 they are independent. And believe me, around the world people look at our judges with awe and admiration, so I\u2019m not going to quarrel or criticise the judges. Clearly there are two different legal views \u2013 the high court in England had a very different opinion and the supreme court will have to adjudicate in the course of the next few days, and I think it\u2019s proper for politicians to let them get on and do that. Asked about Kwarteng saying people questioned the independence of the judiciary, he went on: It is very important, as I say, that we respect the independence of the judiciary. They are learned people \u2026 There\u2019s a separation of powers in this country. In an interview on The Andrew Neil Show last night, Kwarteng said his own personal view was that judges were impartial, but he wanted to acknowledge that \u201cmany people \u2026 are saying that the judges are biased.\u201d He went on: \u201cMany people, many leave voters, many people up and down the country, are beginning to question the partiality of the judges. That\u2019s just a fact.\u201d Johnson said the government had been \u201cmassively accelerating\u201d preparations for a no-deal Brexit. Asked about the Operation Yellowhammer document, he said: It is very important to understand what this document is. This is a worst-case scenario which civil servants obviously have to prepare for. But in the last few months, and particularly in the 50 days since I\u2019ve been prime minister, we\u2019ve been massively accelerating our preparations. We\u2019re trying to get a deal. And I\u2019m very hopeful we will get a deal with our European friends on October 17 or 18 or thereabouts. But if we have to come out on October 31 with no deal, we will be ready ... What you are looking at here is just the sensible preparations, the worst-case scenario, that you would expect any government to do. He listed some of the areas he expected to feature in the Queen\u2019s speech. He said: We need a Queen\u2019s speech. We need to get on and do all sorts of things at a national level \u2026 We are going to need bills on education, on health, on housing, on technology, on our vision for investing in science, [the] space programme, on environment, stopping the export of waste overseas and plastics \u2013 there are a huge number of things that we want to get on with and do. UPDATE: Here is a video of the interview. Boris Johnson has denied lying to the Queen over the suspension of parliament, insisting such claims were \u201cabsolutely not\u201d true. Speaking on a visit to NLV Pharos, a lighthouse tender, which is moored alongside HMS Belfast on the Thames, he was asked if he had lied to the Queen when he asked her to prorogue parliament for five weeks. He replied: Absolutely not. The high court in England plainly agrees with us but the supreme court will have to decide. We need a Queen\u2019s speech, we need to get on and do all sorts of things at a national level. He went on to say he was \u201cvery hopeful\u201d there would be a Brexit deal. Parliament will have time both before and after that crucial summit on 17 and 18 October to talk about the Brexit deal. I\u2019m very hopeful that we will get a deal, as I say, at that crucial summit. We\u2019re working very hard \u2013 I\u2019ve been around the European capitals talking to our friends. I think we can see the rough area of a landing space, of how you can do it \u2013 it will be tough, it will be hard, but I think we can get there. The government has repeatedly claimed it suspended parliament because it wants a Queen\u2019s speech in October \u2013 even though, at five weeks, this is the longest prorogation for almost 90 years, and it is well known ministers wanted to limit the chances available to MPs to pass laws that might obstruct a no-deal Brexit. Formally, it was up to the Queen to prorogue parliament, but she had no choice in the matter, or the length of the suspension, because constitutionally she is obliged to follow the advice of her prime minister. The allegation that Johnson might have lied to the Queen about the real reasons for prorogation was fuelled by yesterday\u2019s judgment from the Scottish court of session that the government did not tell the truth about the real reason for prorogation. In its summary of the judgment, the court said: All three first division judges have decided that the PM\u2019s advice to the HM the Queen is justiciable, that it was motivated by the improper purpose of stymying parliament and that it, and what has followed from it, is unlawful. UPDATE: It was misleading of Johnson to claim that the high court in London agreed with the government because it did not take a view on whether he had been telling the truth or not about the real reasons for prorogation. See 12.52pm for more. Thank you to MrPlebby in the comments below for pointing out that, while Amber Rudd may be cautiously supporting proportional representation now, two years ago, when she was not sitting as an independent MP, she was firmly against. This is what she said in a post that is still on her website. I am afraid that I do not agree with your views on PR, and fully support first past the post. This tried-and-tested system ensures stability and clear governance, preventing disproportionate influence by minority parties with minimal public support, who typically end up holding the balance of power in PR systems. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, made the same argument as Michael Gove (see 9.22am) when he appeared on the Today programme and was asked about the Operation Yellowhammer report. He said it was a \u201cplanning assumption\u201d and the government was addressing the potential problems identified in the document. He told the programme. That is why we are doing things about it. That is why the chancellor opened his chequebook, that\u2019s why we are spending the money on doing lots of things to mitigate those assumptions. Every day, we plan everything from whether we need to find alternative suppliers, whether we need to go out to the private sector to charter things, whether we need to plan using our army or our police forces in certain scenarios. Wallace was on the programme to talk about a government announcement to build five frigates at Rosyth dockyard in Fife. The Downing Street press release is here, and here is my colleague Dan Sabbagh\u2019s story. Police officers from all over the country should be drafted in to help handle traffic in Kent in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the chairman of the county council has said. As the Press Association reports, Paul Carter told the Today programme that he wanted \u201cboots on the ground\u201d and assurances that arrangements were in place for police officers and Highways England staff nationwide to be ready to \u201cman the pumps\u201d. He said: I want assurance from Highways England and Kent police that they have got the reciprocal arrangements with other police forces and Highways England officers around the country to make sure that they come into Kent in sufficiency to be able to man the pumps and make sure that the fluidity and the Operation Brock strategy, to keep the road network in Kent open at all times and direct them to where lorries if they are delays at the port, will be held until such time as they can depart from those ports. Carter, who leads the Conservative-controlled council, said \u201caccelerated progress\u201d has been made since the Yellowhammer report \u2013 released on Wednesday night \u2013 was drafted on 2 August. There are still two or three outstanding matters which I am beating the drum on which need resolving in short order. Asked if he was worried about a no-deal Brexit, he said: As long as we get satisfactory answers and progress on how the operating model for customs clearance is going to work and communicate that to the logistics haulage industry, I am pretty confident that we can avoid disruption in Kent. From Sky\u2019s Michelle Clifford Lord Hope, a former supreme court judge who is now the convenor of cross-bench peers in the Lords, has rejected claims that MPs can now re-enter the House of Commons after yesterday\u2019s Scottish court ruling that prorogation was illegal. Hope, a former lord president of Scotland\u2019s courts, said appeal judges in Edinburgh were right not to order Boris Johnson to reconvene parliament before the supreme court hears the Scottish case alongside the English and Northern Irish challenges next week. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, Hope said: [On] Tuesday morning at 1.30, parliament was prorogued and it was prorogued to a given date on the command of Her Majesty, and you can\u2019t just go back in and start without that order being set aside. Quite how you do that is a matter of parliamentary procedure and I just don\u2019t know quite what the answer is meantime. Hope, who was deputy president of the supreme court until his retirement as a judge in 2013, said he expected a speedy decision by the nine judges hearing the supreme court case. Three days are set aside but I rather doubt it will take three days. And I\u2019m sure they will issue a judgement as soon as they possibly can, maybe for reasons given later because like everybody else, they understand the urgency of this. And it really would be a nonsense if they didn\u2019t issue a decision until parliament resumes on 14 October. So they\u2019ll certainly lean over backwards to get a decision out as soon as they possibly can. It was \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d and \u201cbaseless\u201d for Downing Street sources and government ministers to suggest the Scottish judges were politically biased. Judges are impartial and they\u2019re under oath to decide matters according to the law, and political influence either way has nothing whatever to do with it, and of course it\u2019s one of the risks that judges run when they get involved in cases of this kind is that people make that kind of accusation. Following her resignation from the cabinet at the weekend over Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy, Amber Rudd is giving a speech tonight in which she will suggest proportional representation might produce a parliament better able to reflect what the public wants. She was on the Today programme this morning, and here are some other points she made. Rudd claimed the Tories could face challenges from up to 20 candidates standing at the next election as independent Conservatives. She said there were 22 former Tories in the party who do not take the party whip (the 21 who had the whip removed last week after rebelling over Brexit, and Rudd herself, who resigned the whip at the weekend). She said she had been \u201cstruck by how effectively they [the 21] are organised as a group\u201d and she said she hoped No 10 would agree to restore the whip to all of them. She would like to be able to retake the whip herself, she said, but it would depend on how others were treated. Asked what she would do at the election, she said: I am a Conservative, and if it comes to a general election in the short term, although of course none of us know when that might be, if I\u2019m not back with the Conservative whip then I\u2019m likely to fight as an independent Conservative. And I\u2019m looking at options at the moment \u2026 I will not be fighting for another party. I hope to be fighting as a Conservative and, if not, with up to 20 people, as an independent Conservative, depending on whether the whip has been returned. Rudd has already made it clear she will be looking for a new constituency because she will not stand again in Hastings and Rye, where she had a majority of just 346 over Labour at the previous election. She did not explain why she thought up to 20 people might be standing as independent Conservatives. Of the 21 Tories who lost the whip, almost half have said they intend to stand down at the next election. She said people still in cabinet should \u201cspeak out\u201d if they are worried about what Boris Johnson is doing. She said Johnson\u2019s confrontational approach to parliament was \u201ca mistake\u201d. Theresa May considered proroguing parliament to help pass Brexit, but rejected the idea, May said. Asked about the current prorogation, she said: I am surprised, and I think it is a very un-Conservative thing to be doing. I have sat in three cabinets under three different prime ministers, and this level of confrontation with parliament I have never seen before. Under Theresa May we did briefly look at the idea of prorogation. It was dismissed because we knew it would be the wrong approach, the wrong way to treat a parliament full of representatives of their own communities. And this level of confrontation, I think, is unwelcome. I think it is a mistake. I think, as politicians and Conservatives, we should be looking to find the compromise and using persuasion and intelligence to try and find that compromise. Quite late last night, the government finally published the Operation Yellowhammer document about what might happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit. You can read the document here (pdf). And here is our overnight story. This morning, as he left his home, Michael Gove, the minister in charge of no-deal Brexit planning, sought to play down the report\u2019s conclusions. He claimed that over the past six weeks, the government had taken \u201cconsiderable steps\u201d to address the potential problems outlined in the document. He said: The Yellowhammer documents are a worst-case scenario. They are produced so government can take plans and take steps in order to mitigate any of those consequences. And over the course of the last six weeks, this government has taken considerable steps in order to ensure that, if there is a no-deal scenario, we can leave in the safest and smoothest possible way. But of course it is important to stress that we are fighting hard for a deal, the prime minister has been making diplomatic progress this week, and we are on our way to getting a better deal. There will be a lot more on this as the day goes on. Here what\u2019s coming up \u2026 9am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, speaks at the launch of a report by Lord Skidelsky on how to achieve a four-day working week. 9am: Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, speaks at the Universities UK conference. 10am: The high court in Belfast rules on the legal challenge against prorogation brought in Northern Ireland. 4pm: McDonnell speaks at the publication of a report on a plan for a financial transactions tax. At some point today, Boris Johnson is also due to take part in a visit to promote the announcement of a contract to build five new frigates. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament was ruled \u201cimproper\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d on Wednesday by three senior Scottish judges, who concluded it had been done with \u201cthe purpose of stymying parliament\u201d. In their official rulings, issued by the Scottish courts late on Thursday afternoon (pdf), they agreed unanimously there was no other reason for the suspension. Lord Carloway, the Lord President, said prorogation was sought \u201cin a clandestine manner\u201d when Downing Street knew that 75 MPs and peers were taking the government to court to block it. No 10 also knew that prorogation would stymie debate about Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans, No 10 gave the court no clear reason to justify prorogation, and the five weeks Johnson got from the Queen was \u201can extraordinary length of time\u201d. Carloway said: \u201cThe circumstances demonstrate that the true reason for the prorogation is to reduce the time available for parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit at a time when such scrutiny would appear to be a matter of considerable importance, given the issues at stake. \u201c[Put] shortly, prorogation was being mooted specifically as a means to stymie any further legislation regulating Brexit.\u201d Lord Drummond Young argued that the UK government\u2019s failure to provide the Scottish court with any valid reasons for proroguing Westminster for five weeks supported their conclusions it was unjustified. He wrote: \u201cIf no reason is given, in the present circumstances I am of opinion that the decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks out of the seven remaining before the United Kingdom is scheduled to leave the European Union leads inevitably to the conclusion that the reason for prorogation was to prevent parliamentary scrutiny of the government.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWherever law ends, tyranny begins,\u201d propounded John Locke in 1690. The idea was captured and adjusted to the needs of our modern constitutional democracy by Tom Bingham, a pioneer of conceiving justice as the \u201crule of law\u201d (and the \u201cgreatest judge of his era\u201d, as his obituary in the Guardian noted). I wonder what this great proponent of judicial independence and the rule of law would make of this government\u2019s utter disregard for both concepts, and for law itself, as a system that government must adhere to if we are not to slip into a tyranny of the executive. Bingham wrote, quoting Dicey: \u201cevery man, whatever his rank or condition, is subject to the ordinary law of the realm and amenable to the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals\u201d. But this government would beg to differ. The PM would \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d than apply the law and seek a further extension to article 50. He prorogued parliament to allow for executive fiat, and misled the Queen in the process (Johnson resists recalling MPs after Scottish ruling, 12 September). We now know this for certain. Scotland\u2019s supreme civil court leaves no doubt: the \u201ctrue reason\u201d for prorogation \u201cwas to stymie parliamentary scrutiny of the executive\u201d; an \u201cegregious case\u201d of failing to comply with \u201cprinciples of democracy and the rule of law\u201d. Any normal-functioning government would take note. The response of a No 10 source was instead to call into question the Scottish judiciary\u2019s impartiality. The end of reason is in sight, and it is preceded by the end of law. Prof Dimitrios Giannoulopoulos Founder and director, Britain in Europe thinktank \u2022 While Boris Johnson repeatedly insists that the prorogation of parliament had nothing to do with Brexit, I, and the 1.7 million others who signed the \u201cDo not prorogue Parliament\u201d petition, have recently received an email with the government response: \u201cProrogation is a prerogative Act of the Crown, exercised on the advice of Ministers. We must respect the referendum result and the UK will be leaving the EU on 31 October whatever the circumstances.\u201d Nothing to do with Brexit though. Neil Jones Swansea \u2022 \u201cBoris Johnson says it is \u2018absolutely\u2019 not true he misled Queen over prorogation\u201d (theguardian.com, 12 September). He would, wouldn\u2019t he? Adrian Willson Bath \u2022 Following the recent judicial ruling on the unprecedented prorogation of parliament, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman claimed it was \u201cto put before MPs a proper domestic legislative programme\u201d. However, since Mr Johnson\u2019s decision was made in camera, we only have his word for this. Would I be better advised to trust the words of my own MP, Ben Wallace, when he stated on camera in a conversation with French defence minister Florence Parly that the real reason for the suspension of parliament was that Boris Johnson doesn\u2019t have the majority to stop parliament blocking his Brexit plans? Austen Lynch Garstang, Lancashire \u2022 John Crace deftly and rightly rebukes the \u201cknown liars\u201d in No 10 (Sketch, 10 September), but I for one am hugely grateful for Dom\u2019s prorogation.

American unions famously won the weekend, Australian unions won the eight-hour day and working class pressure here in Britain resulted in the two-day weekend being firmly normalised after the second world war.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/11/four-day-working-week-tuc-proposals-workers-rights\">A four-day working week? Bring it on | Gregor Gall</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Why should we demand a shorter working week today? For a start, it would address the huge problem of overwork that permeates our labour market. In 2017-18, <a href=\"https://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/causdis/stress.pdf\" title=\"\">57% of all sick days</a> were due to work-related stress, anxiety or depression, and 44% of these were caused by workload pressure alone. In the UK we work some of the longest hours in Europe \u2013 as the report identifies \u2013 and we enjoy the fewest national holidays. With more time to recover and recuperate, workers will perform better, enjoy their work more and inevitably take less sick leave. Numerous studies on existing four-day week companies have shown that productivity relies not just on the sheer number of hours put in, but on the wellbeing, fatigue levels and overall health of the worker too.</p> <p>The latest sign that this once radical thinking is becoming economic common sense is the release today of a <a href=\"https://progressiveeconomyforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PEF_Skidelsky_How_to_achieve_shorter_working_hours.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a> by the economic historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/robertskidelsky\" title=\"\">Robert Skidelsky</a>, and commissioned by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. Even its title, How to achieve shorter working hours, suggests that the debate has moved on from questions of desirability and is now concerned with feasibility.</p> <p>Skidelsky is one of the world\u2019s leading experts on Keynesian economics and the report is very much in this vein, advocating a return to a high-investment economy with strong trade unions at the fore. It was Keynes who famously predicted that by 2030 we would (or perhaps should?) all be working 15-hour working weeks. He argued that the nature of industrial development was such that ever more efficient and productive technologies would reduce necessary labour time while providing abundance for all. The main thrust of Keynes\u2019s argument makes sense: with each gain in productivity we could have worked less, enjoyed more leisure and let our machines take on more of the hard graft. Tragically, what actually happened is that once the age of full employment, high productivity and high wages was ended by the neoliberal consensus of the early 1980s, the dream of an even shorter working week became exactly that. The report notes bluntly that \u201cthe British economy has stopped working in a way which supports a fall in working hours\u201d.</p> <p>But the \u201csecond machine age\u201d is now upon us, and the question of working time is quite rightly being raised once again. With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/16/self-driving-trucks-automation-jobs-trucking-industry\" title=\"\">driverless technology</a> breathing down transport workers\u2019 necks, software bots replacing the admin work of white-collar staff and advanced AI set to impact many other sectors, there is wide acknowledgement that nothing short of a radical industrial strategy is required.</p> <p>Without targeted government intervention aimed at managing this transition, we could see an even more polarised society, between those who reap the rewards from innovation \u2013 the platform tech giants, the rentiers and the highly skilled \u2013 and those who have been deskilled, their wages depressed and their jobs intensified. On one side, Jeff Bezos \u2013 the first man to have a 12-figure fortune \u2013 and on the other, an Amazon warehouse worker.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dea7d5adaa767ed59783cb470c20190a511fcc74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dea7d5adaa767ed59783cb470c20190a511fcc74/0_21_5628_3377/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Skidelsky\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Skidelsky\u2019s report \u2018advocates a return to a high-investment economy with strong trade unions at the fore\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In other words, automation will not produce more free time for ordinary workers unless adequate policy is in place to ensure it. The past century has shown us that workplace technologies have often been introduced by employers as a way of simply maximising productivity without sharing the surplus time and/or profits with employees. This trend will continue unless a practical and enforced link between automation and free time is constructed.</p> <p>Skidelsky\u2019s report makes gestures in this direction, advocating investment in automation technology in the public sector with the aim of reducing working weeks gradually. The sights aren\u2019t set particularly high however, with a target of a 35-hour week over a 10-year period being proposed. Perhaps most strikingly, the report argues for a Jobs Guarantee Programme whereby the state would be an \u201cemployer of last resort\u201d. These jobs would pay no less than the national living wage and would constitute an attempt to exert upward pressure on pay. It should be pointed out that many questions hang over such a job guarantee, not least around the practical rollout of such a measure. The Skidelsky report establishes that reducing working time should be an aim for an incoming Labour government. In this sense it is an important moment in the discussion. However, much more radical reforms are needed beyond job guarantees and shaving a couple of hours off our working weeks.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://autonomy.work/portfolio/the-shorter-working-week-a-report-from-autonomy-in-collaboration-with-members-of-the-4-day-week-campaign/\" title=\"\">Autonomy\u2019s own report on this issue</a>, we proposed policies that would go a long way to achieving an actual four-day week within a decade. The creation of an organisation to integrate and co-manage automation technologies across the whole economy, a reduced working time directive, the creation of a Citizen\u2019s Dividend (or basic income) and mechanisms by which workers could determine how technology was implemented in the workplace were all part of our proposals.</p> <p>If we really want to tackle our high burnout, low-wage economy, we require bold solutions and a robust government strategy; Skidelsky\u2019s review is an important contribution to the growing conversation, but we need to think bigger if we are to get the free time that a four-day week promises.</p> <p>\u2022 Will Stronge is co-director of the thinktank Autonomy</p>",

But the \u201csecond machine age\u201d is now upon us, and the question of working time is quite rightly being raised once again. With driverless technology breathing down transport workers\u2019 necks, software bots replacing the admin work of white-collar staff and advanced AI set to impact many other sectors, there is wide acknowledgement that nothing short of a radical industrial strategy is required. Without targeted government intervention aimed at managing this transition, we could see an even more polarised society, between those who reap the rewards from innovation \u2013 the platform tech giants, the rentiers and the highly skilled \u2013 and those who have been deskilled, their wages depressed and their jobs intensified. On one side, Jeff Bezos \u2013 the first man to have a 12-figure fortune \u2013 and on the other, an Amazon warehouse worker. In other words, automation will not produce more free time for ordinary workers unless adequate policy is in place to ensure it. The past century has shown us that workplace technologies have often been introduced by employers as a way of simply maximising productivity without sharing the surplus time and/or profits with employees. This trend will continue unless a practical and enforced link between automation and free time is constructed. Skidelsky\u2019s report makes gestures in this direction, advocating investment in automation technology in the public sector with the aim of reducing working weeks gradually. The sights aren\u2019t set particularly high however, with a target of a 35-hour week over a 10-year period being proposed. Perhaps most strikingly, the report argues for a Jobs Guarantee Programme whereby the state would be an \u201cemployer of last resort\u201d. These jobs would pay no less than the national living wage and would constitute an attempt to exert upward pressure on pay. It should be pointed out that many questions hang over such a job guarantee, not least around the practical rollout of such a measure. The Skidelsky report establishes that reducing working time should be an aim for an incoming Labour government. In this sense it is an important moment in the discussion. However, much more radical reforms are needed beyond job guarantees and shaving a couple of hours off our working weeks. In Autonomy\u2019s own report on this issue, we proposed policies that would go a long way to achieving an actual four-day week within a decade. The creation of an organisation to integrate and co-manage automation technologies across the whole economy, a reduced working time directive, the creation of a Citizen\u2019s Dividend (or basic income) and mechanisms by which workers could determine how technology was implemented in the workplace were all part of our proposals. If we really want to tackle our high burnout, low-wage economy, we require bold solutions and a robust government strategy; Skidelsky\u2019s review is an important contribution to the growing conversation, but we need to think bigger if we are to get the free time that a four-day week promises. \u2022 Will Stronge is co-director of the thinktank Autonomy",

      "bodyText": "The humble loaf has emerged as an unlikely casualty of a no-deal Brexit in Ireland, with prices charged by commercial flour suppliers in Belfast set to rise due to cross-border tariffs. There are just three flour mills on the island of Ireland and the only two that can supply industrial quantities are in Northern Ireland. \u201cWe have two mills in Belfast and 60% of their output goes into the Republic of Ireland. Ireland doesn\u2019t have any bulk commercial mill at all and imports the rest of its flour from the UK,\u201d said Michael Bell, the executive director of Northern Ireland\u2019s Food and Drink Association. Under a no-deal Brexit, flour would be subject to a tariff of \u20ac172 a tonne, which could add around 15 cents to the price of a humble sliced loaf. \u201cWe are not talking about there being no bread on the shelves, but that it is just going to be more expensive and depending on your income that will be more or less significant,\u201d said Alex Waugh, the director general of the National Association of British and Irish Millers (Nabim). In a no-deal scenario, EU tariffs will be applicable on a range of food items coming into Ireland from the UK. The tariffs on flour will hit bread, biscuits, cakes, confectionary and commercially produced frozen pizza assembled in factories outside Dublin but destined for the massive UK market. For Irish bakers, the choices are to absorb the cost, pass it on to the consumer or source flour in France, Germany or Lithuania. \u201cCan you source the flour in France? No,\u201d said Bell. \u201cTheir mill structure is different and their flour has a different protein content which is good for baguettes but not for high-rise bread.\u201d Bakers have looked at getting flour further afield, in Germany or Lithuania, said Waugh but the cost of getting it back to Ireland added significant overheads and logistical challenges. Currently, Ireland imports about 150-170 28-tonne tankers of flour a week from UK, with one third from Northern Ireland and two-thirds from Britain. Bakers south of the border are looking at stockpiling flour but that is not considered a sustainable solution. \u201cIt is the thing that people often forget in this debate, that tariffs are a tax and they are a tax on consumers because there just isn\u2019t sufficient margin in the supply chain to fully absorb so the costs will be passed on,\u201d says Paul Kelly, director of the Food and Drink Industry Ireland. He sees a no-deal Brexit as a disastrous misapplication of tariffs, which are designed as a tool to protect European farmers and food production for social reasons. \u201cThe social contract operating here is that farmers have a high cost base because of the high cost of living in the EU, high standards of regulation and safety that they have to adhere to,\u201d he says. Bell thinks the British government simply doesn\u2019t consider food production seriously enough or understand that the supply chains on the two islands are so interconnected because of the efficiencies needed to keep prices down. \u201cSome supermarkets have said: \u2018Tariffs are not our problem, it\u2019s the suppliers\u2019 problem.\u2019 Suppliers are saying: \u2018We beg to differ.\u2019 They are saying they are not going to take it at all, which means suppliers will end up having to break contracts because they won\u2019t be able to supply at below cost,\u201d says Bell.",
