Her intervention came ahead of what is widely expected to be a combative meeting of Labour\u2019s ruling national executive committee (NEC) on Tuesday, to sign off its manifesto for the European parliamentary elections. Labour\u2019s deputy leader Tom Watson, who sits on the NEC, made clear on Sunday that he will use the meeting to push for a confirmatory vote on any Brexit deal to be included in the manifesto \u2013 even urging Labour supporters on Twitter to lobby potential waverers.

The NEC will consider a draft manifesto, presented by Labour\u2019s policy chief, Andrew Fisher, which is expected to stick closely to the conference policy of supporting a referendum only in specific circumstances. However, shadow cabinet ministers keen for the party to back a people\u2019s vote argue that Labour\u2019s formal position changed when Corbyn whipped his MPs to support a confirmatory referendum earlier this month. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, who attends the cross-party talks alongside Long-Bailey and John McDonnell, said in the House of Commons during the debate: \u201cAt this late stage it is clear that any Brexit deal agreed in this parliament will need further democratic approval.\u201d He was among those angered by the text of a campaign leaflet for the European elections leaked to the Huffington Post last week that failed to mention a referendum.

UK politicians have not been doing this in relation to climate change \u2013 this is Thunberg\u2019s point. No one who has actually read the IPCC report, not just the milder summary for policymakers, could see Attenborough\u2019s programme as \u201cdoom-laden hysteria\u201d. Jenkins\u2019 piece lacks grounding; it is not a worthy contribution to the debate he advocates. Dr Caroline Freeman Bristol \u2022 Like Simon Jenkins, I wish Theresa May hadn\u2019t invited Donald Trump to Britain. As she did, he should be offered the normal courtesies. In the navy I was told one salutes the rank, not the person.

If one of the most basic arguments for the end of the union was that Scotland and England were now hopelessly estranged, this now looks almost unanswerable.

Even if a Labour government at Westminster succeeded in calming things down by getting to grips with some key social and economic problems and handing Scotland more power, a great mess of unresolved disagreements within England \u2013 about immigration, the country\u2019s place in the world, and the basics of what it is to be a modern country \u2013 would still fester away, and hold back progress across the UK. Which brings us back to 2014. Self-evidently, there was much more to the campaign for independence than the SNP; indeed, just about all the most exciting, mould-breaking ideas about a new Scotland came from a coalition of forces \u2013 Greens, the radical Scottish left, droves of people new to politics \u2013 that a new referendum would presumably revive. If one of the most basic arguments for the end of the union was that Scotland and England were now hopelessly estranged, this now looks almost unanswerable. The UK\u2019s exit from Europe, moreover, surely shreds arguments against other radical changes, pretty much by definition: so if leaving the EU can be accomplished whatever the resulting disasters, why not Scottish independence? And then there is something I felt deeply in 2014, and that Brexit has sent nuclear. I am English: the country I call home is in a backward-looking mess. But only a few hours\u2019 drive away is a place with at least a sporting chance of pushing itself into the future. If another independence vote materialised, whatever the surrounding tensions and complexities, I would be back there in a flash, to see if at least one part of these islands can leave behind the current wretchedness, and find something better. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

Of course, Theresa May or whoever is in her place when the time comes will refuse the request for section 30 to be triggered.

      "bodyText": "The response of unionists to Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s latest timetable for Scottish independence was as feeble as it was predictable. In the four and a half years or so that have elapsed since the last independence referendum, their response has rarely risen above their favoured catcalls of \u201cdivisive\u201d and \u201cnow is not the time\u201d. If not now or in the next couple of years though, when? The UK\u2019s Brexit strategy, if it can be called such, was abducted by the Tory hard right at the start of this process and has not been seen since. In its place has been a three-year circus of the damned where the grotesques and freaks that we all knew scuttled around the frayed edges of Conservatism got their chance to appear in the spotlight. Thus, the government\u2019s offering was reduced to muttering about dodgy and untrustworthy Europeans and to a curious concern for Ireland not seen since it carved out the gerrymandered fake state of Northern Ireland. The post-Brexit bequest for England will be a country that has fallen in on itself, grievously riven by the rancid nature of political debate since the EU referendum. Its government will be led by a hard-right faction for whom the words \u201chealing\u201d and \u201creconciliation\u201d are regarded as signs of weakness. Compared with this, the \u201cdivisiveness\u201d of another Scottish independence referendum will be like a day out at the seaside. Has there ever been a better time for Scotland to gain its independence? Scottish nationalists and the wider independence movement have been preparing for the next referendum for a couple of years now and Sturgeon\u2019s speech last Wednesday marked the end of the first stage of this process. It produced the growth commission report overseen by the SNP\u2019s respected economic adviser, Andrew Wilson, which sought to provide a more realistic cost and risk analysis of independence than was apparent in 2014\u2019s sunny white paper. During this time, the concept of independence has been portrayed as the normal one for modern democracies to aspire to. Of course, Theresa May or whoever is in her place when the time comes will refuse the request for section 30 to be triggered. Sturgeon\u2019s speech, though, is the first step in the SNP\u2019s strategy of portraying the Tories as fearful, inflexible and patrician. Yet, while Sturgeon indicated her desire for a referendum to be held before 2021, senior voices in the SNP are also looking at the Holyrood election that year to determine the fate of independence. At the top of the SNP\u2019s election manifesto would be a pledge to hold a second referendum. An overall majority would morally oblige Westminster to grant it and tip the scales towards the SNP if the UK supreme court were to get involved. Viewed through this lens, Sturgeon\u2019s speech could be considered as a potentially defining move on the constitutional chessboard. The absence of anything resembling a properly led opposition in Scotland characterised the lazy responses to Sturgeon\u2019s speech by the two main parties of the union. They ought to be targeting the SNP\u2019s patchy record in delivering in some key devolved areas. One of these is the Social Security Act, the Scottish government\u2019s most ambitious programme of change and one that seems to be stalling. The timeline on this has been pushed back significantly and how this additional responsibility will be funded has still not been agreed, as Shirley-Anne Somerville, the cabinet secretary for social security, admitted in a recent interview in the Times. Somerville said last month that full control over the first wave of 11 social security benefits would be maintained by the DWP until Social Security Scotland has the capability to administer them in 2024. The Scottish government claims it has paid out an additional \u00a3197m in welfare benefits. This is more than slightly misleading as \u00a3197m is the amount that\u2019s so far been spent on implementing the new agency while there\u2019s been no mention of the start-up budget having already climbed from \u00a3300m to \u00a3400m. No one can accuse the SNP of failing to invest in the Scottish NHS but historical failure characterised by rank managerial incompetence has made this the most difficult portfolio in Holyrood.
