David Ritter, the chief executive of Greenpeace Australia Pacific, said the organisation, whose Australia Pacific arm has more than one million members, had made multiple requests in writing and received no reply. \u201cParticularly given the significance of Greenpeace in the environmental arena \u2026 we are very surprised the minister has seen fit not to engage at all,\u201d Ritter said. \u201cIt\u2019s treating a million-plus people who care about her portfolio deeply with contempt.\u201d Ritter said the situation was \u201creally unusual\u201d. Both he and Schneiders said that past ministers Tony Burke and Greg Hunt had regularly made themselves or staff available for meetings but Schneiders said it became tougher under the former minister Josh Frydenberg. \u201cJosh was the beginning of the rot,\u201d Schneiders said. But other groups have met with the minister and her staff since her appointment, including Humane Society International and the Australian Conservation Foundation. Price, through a spokesman, said she \u201ccontinues to meet extensively with environmental stakeholders\u201d and had done since she became the assistant environment minister in 2017. The spokesman said she had met with the Humane Society and the Wilderness Society while she was the assistant minister. \u201cThe minister continues to meet with as many stakeholders as possible within the constraints of her portfolio,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThe minister has worked closely with all agencies in her portfolio across recent extreme weather events including the Menindee Lakes, Tasmanian bushfires and the Townsville floods.\u201d The Humane Society has been pushing for the minister\u2019s office to make a decision on five overdue threatened species listings, some of which have been delayed for years by successive ministers in the current government. The organisation wrote to Price again in December saying \u201cit is our understanding that you are currently in breach of the [Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation] Act on multiple counts by failing to make a decision within the statutory timeframes\u201d. The species are three woodlands recommended for critically endangered or endangered listings, the Australian sea lion \u2013 recommended for an endangered listing \u2013 and the spectacled flying fox, also recommended for an endangered listing. HSI believes the spectacled flying fox could now be critically endangered after thousands were wiped out in Queensland\u2019s recent heatwave. The organisation said it has had no reply to its December correspondence, which focused on the delayed woodlands listings. The government\u2019s key independent committee for the assessment of threatened species, the threatened species scientific committee, also currently has five vacancies including its chair. The department of environment and energy told Guardian Australia in January the minister was in the process of making new appointments to the 10-member committee with a view to having all positions filled in time for its first meeting in late February. But the roles are still vacant and the committee plans to sit later this month with its former members in the event appointments have not been made. In November, there was no Australian government representation at the conference of parties (Cop) to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Egypt. Evan Quartermain, HSI\u2019s head of programs, said the organisation had taken to using Twitter to try to communicate with the minister because trying to get answers through her office about the species and habitats it had nominated for listing had failed. \u201cMelissa Price is failing to fulfil even the most simple responsibilities she has as environment minister,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to notify the minister that she\u2019s long overdue in making these decisions for months, but have received no official response. The silence is deafening, and we\u2019re now questioning whether or not she\u2019s even aware of the issue to the point that we\u2019ve taken to social media campaigns to get it in front of her.\u201d Quartermain said on top of that, the threatened species scientific committee was set to meet at half capacity because the minister had \u201cneedlessly delayed making appointments\u201d. \u201cThese are routine, uncontroversial decisions that are being ignored at a time of great need,\u201d he said. Price\u2019s spokesman did not provide a reason for the continued delays for some of the threatened species listings. He said the government was \u201crightly considered in making such declarations\u201d and several were still under consideration. \u201cThe importance of a listing highlights the need to ensure the most qualified people are represented on the Threatened Species Scientific Committee and positions will be finalised shortly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe committee is able to function in accordance with the Act in its present form.\u201d He said the government usually sent representatives to the biodiversity Cop but there were issues related to the location of the conference and travel advice prevented them from attending. \u201cThe environment portfolio is broad and rightly generates significant correspondence and requests for meetings which are addressed in as timely a manner as possible,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Reece Prescod is as disarmingly honest as he is dizzingly fast. So when the 22-year-old is asked whether he ever feels a devil on his shoulder trying to distract him from becoming the world\u2019s best sprinter, he smiles, says \u201cYeah, yeah, 100%\u201d and then adds bluntly: \u201cTo me there is no point in going on a night out if you are going to be half-hearted. If I am going out, I go full sesh.\u201d Full sesh, it turns out, is a few drinks at a meal, followed by a few more afterwards and staying out until the small hours \u2013 which is hardly ideal when one\u2019s intention is to win Olympic 100m gold in Tokyo. But Prescod says in recent months he has changed; these days he is scanning the bigger picture, not chasing short-term pleasures. Such an attitude also explains why Prescod, one of the main attractions at Saturday\u2019s Birmingham indoor grand prix, has decided to skip next month\u2019s European Indoor Championships in Glasgow, despite being a favourite for 60m gold. On the surface it seems a strange decision given he recently ran 6.53sec \u2013the third fastest time in 2019. However, Prescod and his coach, Jonas Dodoo, believe swerving Glasgow will give them a greater chance of making a splash at the world championships in September. \u201cAfter I ran 6.53 everyone was like \u2018yes!\u2019 and there was hype, hype, hype about doing the Europeans,\u201d Prescod says. \u201cMy coach also asked me if I wanted to go but I told him while it\u2019s always good to have a medal what\u2019s the bigger plan? I want to win a 100m medal at the world championships and run sub-10 seconds all the time.\u201d His growing professionalism allied to his natural speed makes one wonder how high Prescod may soar in 2019, given he ran the fourth-fastest 100m last year, a wind-assisted 9.88sec. However, he is not getting carried away. \u201cThere are still guys out there who are faster than me, doing better things than me, so it\u2019s about how I get better,\u201d he says. \u201cI finished fourth in the world rankings last year, so there are still three places to go. How am I going to get better than those guys? There\u2019s still more to do. I don\u2019t want to rest on that. It\u2019s about pushing myself to the next goal.\u201d There are other ways Prescod has changed his mentality. \u201cLast year I was big on Fifa and playing it a lot but this year I\u2019ve replaced it with listening to podcasts and reading. \u201cWhen I\u2019m driving to places, last year it was house mix all the way \u2013 boom, boom, boom \u2013 and two hours later I had a headache. Now I only listen to such music when I\u2019m at competition.\u201d Prescod also cites basketball\u2019s Kobe Bryant as a big influence. \u201cHe prepares for things so well that, when it comes to the big show, he\u2019s ready to go,\u201d he says. \u201cI know that to keep a good line of progression you\u2019ve got to think completely differently too.\u201d And that, Prescod realises, includes cutting out the late nights. \u201cIt is so tricky,\u201d he says. \u201cI train in Loughborough.

      "bodyText": "Shortly after Laura Muir first broke into the British team in 2014 she received an unexpected request from the Welsh middle distance legend Kirsty Wade. \u201cWe think Laura has something special,\u201d she wrote in a long email via her husband. \u201cAnd we would love to see her name in front of mine in the rankings over the next few years.\u201d Five years on, Muir, who still has the email, intends to oblige by beating Wade\u2019s British indoor mile record of 4:23.86 \u2013 which has stood for 31 years \u2013 at Saturday\u2019s Birmingham grand prix. \u201cAll going to plan, a record should hopefully be on the cards,\u201d said Muir, who already holds numerous national records between 1,000m and 5,000m. \u201cIt\u2019s the one in the middle that I am missing out of the ones I have indoors, so it would be very nice to add another one.\u201d The race will be Muir\u2019s final prep run before next month\u2019s European Indoor Championships in Glasgow, where she will defend both her 1500m and 3,000m titles, and she says that her form could not be better. \u201cAt the British champs last week my coach Andy Young wanted me to sub-60 secs for the last 400m and I ran 56,\u201d she said. \u201cI was like \u2018wow, OK, that ticks that box\u2019. \u201cMy sessions I have been happy with, the endurance ones and sprinting ones. I have been running PB sessions at both ends. I am very happy where I am at.\u201d Muir also explained why she had changed her mind and will go for two gold medals in Glasgow, having originally intended to run one event. \u201cI am running really well, there are no injury concerns, so I thought \u2018why not go for it?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIf it had been somewhere else, I don\u2019t know if we would have done it, it is quite a big ask. But to do the double-double in Glasgow is too good an opportunity to miss out on.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 16 February 2019. An earlier version incorrectly described Kirsty Wade as Scottish.",

      "bodyText": "Capoue: \u201cI enjoyed the goal. But it was about team-work. We worked all week for this game and we did it. We\u2019re so proud.\u201d Deeney: \u201cIt was Cup final for them. We didn\u2019t want to be the ones to go out so we did it professionally. We were in control for a lot of it but weren\u2019t dominating play and were getting a bit sloppy at times in the first half. But we talked about that at half-time and got better ... We\u2019re not playing the best at the minute but we\u2019re grinding it out. We\u2019ve got character and resolve and when we\u2019re on it, we\u2019re a tough team to beat.\u201d Watford are into the last eight of the FA Cup thanks to Etienne Capoue\u2019s goal just before half-time. It was not a swaggering performance by the Premier League team, who enjoyed a couple of let-offs against a reasonable QPR side in a generally scrappy affair. But none of that will bother Javi Gracia, whose one step closer to ending Watford\u2019s long, long wait for a trophy. 90+2 min: Deeney holds the ball up down the far end of the pitch and then wins a freekick near the corner flag. Watford are killing this. 90 min: There will be at least four more minutes ... 90 min: Watford use a corner to waste a few seconds. 88 min: Doucour\u00e9 booked for pulling down Osayi-Samuel. That gives QPR a freekick in a dangerous crossing position on the left. Their whole team pile forward, except for the keeper. Freeman curls it towards the penalty spot. It\u2019s allowed to bounce across to Furlong, who fires the ball across the face of goal. Leistner slides in at the back post ... and steers it wide from two yards! 87 min: Lovely play by Watford around the QPR box, with Quina, Hughes and Deeney all involved before Deeney\u2019s unleashed a shot from 15 yards. Leistner blocked it. QPR substitution: Osayi-Samuel on, Hall off. Watford substitution: Quina on, Cleverley off. 82 min: Watford have dropped deep, protecting their lead with the confidence that QPR won\u2019t be able to open them up. Let\u2019s see if they\u2019re right. 80 min: Cleverley threads a pass through to Deeney, who can\u2019t get it under control. If he had done so, he would have had a shooting opportunity from 20 yards. 78 min: Holebas overhits a freekick from the left. 75 min: Mariappa\u2019s first involvement results in a booking for clonking into Freeman on half-way. Watford substitutions: Doucour\u00e9 and Mariappa on, Gray and Sema off 72 min: Deeney bisects the home defence with a pass from in the hole. Gray rounds the keeper and rolls into the net... but the flag is up for offside. That was a tight call and the only replay doesn\u2019t give conclusive evidence either way. QPR substitutions: Hemed and Eze on, Wells and Wszolek off. 71 min: Freeman floats a corner towards the far post. Leistner heads wide. 69 min: Holebas\u2019s corner is cleared to the edge of the area. Cleverly hits the bouncing ball from the edge of the D but fails to keep it down. Over the bar it flies. 68 min: Sema wins a corner after a strong and tricky run down the left. 64 min: Good stuff from QPR. They\u2019ve got the upper hand in midfield, with Freeman, Cousin and Luongo all picking nice passes. It\u2019s only when they get near the box that the hosts\u2019 attacks unravel. But Watford would be ill-advised to rely on that for the rest of the game. The Premier League side need to perk up pronto. 63 min: Kabasele makes a bad mistake at the back, passing straight to Wells. The forward takes a few touches and then tries to curl one around the defender and into the bottom corner from 23 yards. But he doesn\u2019t get enough bend on it and the ball droops wide. And he had better options, too, with a teammates either side of him. McClaren holds his head in his hands, dismayed at the opportunity wasted. 61 min: QPR apply pressure and Watford look a little panicky at the back but eventually hoof the ball to safety. 59 min: Hughes manhandled to the ground by Bidwell, giving Watford a freekick wide on the right. Cleverley delivers. Furlong heads clear at the back post. 57 min: QPR are not out of this. Freeman and Cousins are making plenty of gains in midfield and Smith is an ever-present danger up front. The match is showing signs of opening up and you get the feeling there\u2019ll be another goal - and it could go either way. 55 min: Watford show some life for the first time in the second period, Gray and Hughes combining well down the right before Janmaat hoists in a cross. Lumley catches. 53 min: Cousins bangs a long diagonal ball towards Smith, who, yet again, wins it. He heads down for Freeman, whose lets fly from 22 yards. It whizzes several yards wide. 52 min: Freeman, with a freekick from the left, deposits the ball into the centre. Gomes punches it well clear under pressure. 51 min: A miskick by Hughes prevents Watford from triggering a counter-attack. That\u2019s symptomatic of a lot of their play so far. 49 min: It\u2019s still very scrappy. Watford are in front but have not played particularly well. 47 min: Raners look long for Smith again. He doesn\u2019t let them down, outmuscling two defenders to nod the ball back to Freeman at the edge of the area. But Freeman slips as he unloads his shot, sending the ball bouncing way wide. 46 min: Watford get the second half under way. There were no substitutions during the break. The home side contained their Premier League visitors well for most of the first half and had the better of the few chances - cross from the flanks to Smith, mainly - until a chaotic corner on the stroke of half-time led to Capoue opening the scoring. Watford will fancy their chances of seeing this out from here, but let\u2019s not discount the possibility of Steve McClaren masterminding a comeback ... 45+3 min: Pandemonium in the Watford box following a QPR corner until Smith is penalised for jumping into Gomes. Holebas\u2019s cross from the left is headed behind for a corner. Holesbas sends it towards Kabasele at the back post, but Leistner heads it behind for another corner on the far side. The outswinger reaches Cleverley at the edge of the box. His mis-hits his volley but the ball runs to Capoue, who sweeps a low shot through seeral bodies and into the net from 10 yards! 45 min: Hughes bursts into the QPR box before Leistner steps in to relieve him of the ball. 44 min: Kabasele launches a long ball forward but Rangers deal with it easily. Watford have been grievously short of ideas. 41 min: Freeman intercepts a pass deep in his own territory and then storms forwards before sending a looping pass to Wells, who aims low for the bottom corner from the edge of the box. Gomes plunges to his left to tip it around the post! 40 min: Another break in play for a player to receive treatment. This time it\u2019s Gomes, who got a face in the eye from Smith as both challenged for an aerial ball. 39 min: Smith flicks on a long boot-out by the keeper to Wells, who takes it down on his chest and then tees up Smith for a bang from 20 yards. Britos makes a terrific block. 38 min: Freeman crosses from the let and finds Smith in total isolation for once! The strikers gets his header all wrong, nodding several yards wide from the edge of the six-yard box! Then the replay shows that the reason he had such freedom is because he was offside. 36 min: Whenever QPR attack, Freeman is involved. This time he helps the ball wide to Wells on the left. The winger aims instantly for Smith in the middle. Watford clear with difficulty. 34 min: It\u2019s scrappy. Watford have had most of the ball but have not demonstrated their supposed superiority where it really matters. Rangers have defended well. 31 min: Gomes, attempting to welly clear after a back pass, slices the ball out for a corner. Freeman curls it into the danger zone. Gomes punches it to the edge of the box, where Luongo takes one touch to tee himself up for a volley, which he sends a yard wide! 29 min: Watford build down the right, Hughes rolls a pass to Sema in the box. He looks set to shoot from 16 yards until Bidwell pokes the ball of his foot with an excellent sliding tackle. Janmaat tries to fire towards goal from the edge of the area but smacks it a couple of yards over. The first shot of the game. 28 min: QPR have a freekick wide on the right. Freeman, a deadball ace, curls it towards the back post. But it\u2019s easy picking for Gomes. 27 min: QPR attack down the left this time. Bidwell curls over a very inviting cross. Smith fancies it ... but Holebas does exceptionally well to get to it first and head clear. 26 min: QPR work the ball wide to Wszolek on the right again - a clear strategy. Wszolek duly hoists a cross into the box towards Smith. Gomes knew it was coming and was on hand to clutch it out of the sky before the striker could reach it. 24 min: Luongo works the ball wide to Wszolek, who clips in a cross from the right. But Smith had ventured offside so Watford get the freekick. Still no shots in this game, nor even a corner. 22 min: Holebas aims a long high diagonal ball into the box. Deeney gets the nod-down but Hall steps in to clear. 20 min: Watford continue to lord it in terms of possession but they\u2019ve yet to make any inroads into the deep and disciplined home defence. 18 min: Play has resumed. Smith is now sporting a thick white bandage around his bonce. 16 min: While both players continue to receive treatment, the TV camera pans around the ground showing the fans. It\u2019s an even split between those typing on their mobile phones and those making vivid gestures to rival supporters. Either way, everyone\u2019s fingers are busy. 14 min: There\u2019s a pause to allow medical attention for two players - Smith and Britos - following a clash of heads in the Watford box. 12 min: Hughes wins the ball on the right wing, half-way inside the Rangers\u2019 half. Then he scoops the ball over a defender and into the path of Gray, but the forward can\u2019t get it under control. 9 min: Kabasele steps in to usher Wells off the ball as the winger tried to wriggle free down the right. Power and authority from the defender. 6 min: QPR rumble forward for the first time, Freeman picking out Wszoleck down the right. The wingback sends a cross towards Smith, who manages to send a weak effort bobbling towards goal from 15 yards. He did well, in fairness, to hold off several defenders before doing so. 4 min: Steady possession by Watford before Janmaat looks for Gray in the right-hand channel. The striker gets to the ball first but then misdirects his cross, slicing it out of play under pressure. 2 min: Watford are trying to get the ball down and zip it around but Rangers have done a good job of tampering with those plans so far, with Leistner and Wszolek making some strong early tackles to win the ball back. 1 min: We have kickoff! QPR do the necessary. Kickoff is preceded by a minute\u2019s applause for Gordon Banks. The teams are in the tunnel. QPR are clad in their famous hoops, while Watford are wearing green in memory of the first part of Declan Rice\u2019s international career. \u201cIt\u2019s absolute nonsense that there are no more replays from this stage of the competition,\u201d storms David Wall. \u201cPeople keep making and suggesting changes to the format of the cup, all supposedly with the aim of restoring its previous status.

Those teams will lose eventually, often in an embarrassing fashion to lower division sides. It\u2019s supposed to be the FA challenge cup, implying it\u2019s difficult to win. So make it difficult rather than trying to make it easier. That\u2019s what devalues the cup (if it really is devalued).\u201d Steve McClaren: \u201cWE\u2019ve got to compete first, make sure we stay in the game in the first 15 minutes. I think the key is Deeney and Gray up front - can our back three handle them? Our wingbacks should be our outlet ... we like to transition well and in the last weeks we\u2019ve also got crosses into the box for Matt Smith.\u201d He also says that his team practiced penalties yesterday just in case this tie goes all the way. \u201cBut after yesterday\u2019s penalties I hope it doesn\u2019t go to that!\u201d he quips. Javi Gracia has been chatting to BT Sport about this team selection: \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to chose the best option. With the players we have on the pitch we can get a good performance. All of the squad is ready and all deserve a chance to play. If you have good players who work hard, then you have the options to compete well in all competitions. All the players have high commitment and want to play.\u201d As for the specifics of this game, he says: \u201cWe have to start playing with a very demanding attitude. In this stadium you have to defend well against setpieces and be ready for second balls. We are ready.\u201d Javi Gracia fielded entirely second-strong sides in the previous rounds but here he has made fewer changes - just the five from their last Premier League outing. The home team, meanwhile, field exactly the same side that began Tuesdays 2-1 defeat at Bristol City. QPR: Lumley, Furlong, Leistner, Hall, Wszolek, Cousins, Luongo, Freeman, Bidwell, Wells, Smith Subs: Ingram, Kakay, Scowen, Manning, Osayi-Samuel, Eze, Hemed Watford: Gomes; Jaanmat, Kabasele, Britos, Holebas; Hughes, Capoue, Cleverley, Sema; Deeney, Gray Subs: Dahlberg, Mariappa, Navarro, Doucour\u00e9, Quina, Deulofeu, Penaronda Referee: M Oliver Welcome to the first of this season\u2019s fifth-round duels to the death: there\u2019ll be no replays from this point on so this contest will be decided today, in normal time, in extra-time or by shootout. One way or another, we\u2019re going to have ourselves a winner. What a chance this is, then, for one of these clubs to reach the quarter-finals of a tournament that neither has ever won (though both did reach a final in the 1980s). And they\u2019re got nothing much else on this season: QPR are 18th in the Championship but not really at risk of relegation despite losing their last five league matches, while Watford are eighth in the Premier League, with, admittedly, a possibility of clinching a Europa League place, which would be nice. But not as nice as landing the first major trophy in the club\u2019s history, right?",

Despite over 60 candidates, it is likely to be a choice between President Muhammadu Buhari, and former vice president Atiku Abubakar.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>President Muhammadu Buhari (APC candidate)</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Buhari's 2015 victory with his All Progressives Congress (APC) party was built on three promises: to rid Nigeria of endemic corruption, fix the economy and tackle security threats.</p>\n    <p>The government says it is making progress in the fight against Boko Haram, but it is now in its tenth year, and the economy entered and climbed out of recession under Buhari. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/11/nigeria-election-mr-honesty-muhammadu-buhari-tainted-by-failure-to-tackle-corruption\">Opponents say his government is failing to tackle corruption</a>, while Amnesty International say the army has been responsible for human rights abuses.</p>\n    <p>After spending five months in Britain in 2017 receiving treatment for an undisclosed ailment, opposition groups said he was unfit for office, but Buhari, 76, says he is strong enough to serve.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Atiku Abubakar (PDP candidate)</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Main opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) candidate Atiku, 72, has been caught up in corruption allegations since serving as vice president from 1999-2007. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.&nbsp; </p>\n    <p>He has promised business-friendly policies to double the economy to $900bn by 2025. He wants to privatise parts of the state oil company, and create a $25bn fund to support private sector investment.</p>\n    <p>Atiku's opponents have claimed he would exploit those pro-business policies to enrich himself and those around him.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>A divided country</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Nigeria is deeply divided between the mainly Muslim north and largely Christian south. There are more than 200 distinct ethnic groups. This has led to an unofficial power-sharing agreement, with the presidency alternating between north and south every eight years.</p>\n    <p>It isn't just religion or ethnicity causing fractures. Half of Nigeria\u2019s registered voters are aged 18-35. Many say their ageing leaders are out of touch, and supported a \"Not Too Young to Run\" campaign to encourage younger people seeking office.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Election concerns</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>2015 was the only time Nigeria had a peaceful power handover since civilian government took over in 1999. Even then there was evidence of vote buying, voter intimidation, and other forms of corruption. International observers fear election interference and rigging this time around.</p>\n    <p>Last month, Buhari triggered a constitutional row when he suspended the chief judge, who has a crucial say in resolving election result disputes.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Path to victory</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The candidate with the most votes is declared winner, as long as they have at least one-quarter of the vote in two-thirds of Nigeria's 36 states and the capital.

The advocacy group Keep Sydney Open, created in response to the lockout laws, has morphed into a political party and says it will run candidates on policies including legalising pill testing and relaxing licensing laws. The Greens have opposed the new festival licensing scheme, with the Greens MP Cate Faehrmann calling it \u201cdisastrous \u2026 policy on the run\u201d that would \u201cdecimate\u201d the industry.

      "bodyText": "Out-of-work Australians have complained that private job service providers offered them cash and petrol to lie about their employment status to help falsely claim incentive payments. Those allegations of fraud are contained in a document detailing complaints to the jobs department\u2019s tip-off line, released under freedom of information laws just days after a Senate inquiry found the JobActive system was failing jobseekers. In one complaint received in November 2018 a jobseeker alleged a staff member created false purchase orders for bicycles, pocketing money from a government fund set-up for job service providers to buy goods and services to help people gain skills and find work. The complaints may be the tip of the iceberg, with Greens senator Rachel Siewert warning that \u201cwith little oversight of the quality of services I wonder how much [fraud] is getting identified\u201d and calling on the department to \u201caddress these claims immediately\u201d. The heavily redacted jobs department document details one complaint from August 2018 alleging that a job-services provider \u201cencouraged the job seeker to report employment details incorrectly to [the Department of Human Services] and offered the job seeker \u2018free fuel\u2019 as a reward\u201d. \u201c[The provider] also requested that the job seeker alter the start date of employment to 10 August 2018 and to sign a blank piece of paper.\u201d Another received in May 2017 alleged that an employment consultant \u201coffered them cash to pretend that they are still in employment so they could receive a 26-week outcome claim\u201d. That complaint is listed as \u201cclosed\u201d although the outcome is redacted or not specified. Employers are eligible for wage subsidies of up to $10,000 if they hire new staff for at least 20 hours a week for 26 weeks. JobActive providers receive payments after four, 12 and 26 weeks if workers they place stay in jobs, totalling up to $11,000 after 26-weeks for the most disadvantaged jobseekers down to $1,550 after 26-weeks for the least. One complaint from June 2018 alleged a jobseeker with just five hours\u2019 work a week was \u201crecorded as 30 hours so that the jobseeker would not have to attend the site\u201d, allowing the provider to \u201cinappropriately [claim] an outcome for the job seeker\u201d. A second document titled Program Integrity Subcommittee for Employment Services (Pisces) details five open tip-offs. It includes an allegation made in Queensland in October 2016 that a provider \u201cis making false claims relating to job seeker employment including falsely creating wage subsidies and paying the money back into their own bank account without employer knowledge\u201d. A spokesperson for the department of jobs and small business said that of the complaints listed in the document: three investigations were ongoing; 28 cases were \u201cunsubstantiated or had insufficient evidence to proceed with further action\u201d; and one matter concerning allegations of fraud \u201cwas substantiated and payment recovery was undertaken\u201d. \u201cThe host organisation was excluded for 12 months. \u201cThe Australian government takes any allegations of fraud made against the Commonwealth very seriously.\u201d Labor\u2019s employment services spokeswoman, Terri Butler, said the complaints related \u201cto allegations, not proven incidents\u201d and it was \u201creassuring that those concerns are seemingly being investigated\u201d. Siewert told Guardian Australia the complaints to the department echo concerns in the Senate committee inquiry of \u201cpeople being \u2018churned and parked\u2019 for financial reasons\u201d. \u201cThe way the system works focuses on any job \u2013 [JobActive providers aim to] get them in there and get their payment,\u201d she said. \u201cThe program should be about assisting people to address the barriers they face and work with them to find education and employment pathways that will be fulfilling in the long term.\u201d The Labor and Greens controlled employment references committee recommended the government review the funding model to ensure job services actually boost chances of finding work and consider public service delivery of employment services for some unemployed people. It also recommended the \u201ceffectiveness of employment services be regularly independently evaluated\u201d. Siewert said that where there are allegations of fraud or misconduct \u201cproviders should be investigated, prosecuted where appropriate and lose their contracts\u201d. A spokesman for the Australian Unemployed Workers Union said it had called for \u201can independent body \u2013 an Employment Services Ombudsman \u2013 to investigate agencies and ensure these kinds of frauds don\u2019t continue to occur\u201d.",

After being shown a draft copy of the review, Adani leaked details to the News Corp newspapers and launched a pre-emptive attempt to diminish the draft findings.

      "bodyText": "Although Newport County went out of business in 1989, after being relegated from the Football League the previous season, the start of that decade was a golden era, notably the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup quarter-final against Carl Zeiss Jena in 1981. David Hando (Newport County AFC honorary president and former chairman): If we had goalline technology we\u2019d have won that and played Benfica in the semi-final. Tim Thraves (Fan for more than 60 years, PA announcer since the 1970s): Len Ashurst, the manager, was convinced that we\u2019d scored after seven minutes in the second leg \u2013 and a 1-1 draw would have put us through. I was on the mic that night, there was just under 20,000 in Somerton Park and the atmosphere was unbelievable. John Relish (Played more than 400 games for Newport County, also the first manager of Newport AFC): I remember Carl Zeiss Jena tucked us up. We asked to exchange shirts. They said they\u2019d package theirs up and bring them in the dressing room. When we got home and opened it up, it was their training kit inside. I\u2019ve still got that at home. Only eight years later, on 27 February 1989, the club went out of business. Why did it all unravel and how much blame is attached to the club\u2019s American owner, Jerry Sherman? Hando Sherman was the last straw. But there was a steady decline \u2013 relegation twice, leading to being evicted from the ground for non-payment of rent. Sherman was charismatic and people believed him for a long time. He was taking the players to top restaurants, staying in hotels \u2026 Relish They also made a massive mistake in the early 80s when they sold the ground back to the council. Hando They thought that selling it to the council would save them. The council were patient for a long time but ultimately they and the Inland Revenue wound the club up. The club owed about \u00a3330,000. How did Newport AFC rise from the ashes of the old club? Hando I was the secretary of the Lifeline Society [a fundraising scheme for the club], and people were ringing me, saying: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we form a new club?\u201d I said: \u201cCome to the Lifeline meeting and make the suggestion.\u201d That meeting took place here, at the Lysaght. We found that we could get into the Hellenic League. Then we had two blows from the bodies we thought would be most likely to help. The council thought we were Newport County in disguise, trying to get back into Somerton Park. And the Football Association of Wales thought we had nothing to do with the County and were therefore a new club and had to start at the bottom, in the parks. By that point, you\u2019d agreed to take over as manager, John. How did you put together a side? Relish Knowing so many people locally, we just happened to have a really good batch of lads, including a few from the team that folded. We had about six postmen, we\u2019d pick them up on the coach for a game and they\u2019d sleep all the way there. It sounds as though finding a ground was a bigger challenge than finding players? Hando We could become a Gloucestershire club in the Hellenic League if we had somewhere to play, so we started ringing from A-Z. Everyone was very sympathetic but they had reserve and youth sides and couldn\u2019t share the ground. Then I got to M \u2013 Moreton. I didn\u2019t even know where Moreton-in-Marsh was \u2013 85 miles from Newport. Relish But there was something really good about it. Supporters would come on the coach, there was a pub where we\u2019d stop on the way back. Hando All the shopkeepers were apprehensive about Welsh football hooligans invading a quiet Cotswold market town. There were lots of police for the first game, even police dogs and a horse. But there was no trouble. And by the third home game there was one copper on his bike. And at the end of the season, after we won promotion and moved back to Newport, the shopkeepers and pubs were bereft they\u2019d lost all this trade. In 1990 the club returned to Somerton Park for a couple of seasons. Hando When we won promotion to the Beazer Homes League, the FAW could no longer say we didn\u2019t exist. And the coach always left from the civic centre to purposefully embarrass the council. So we went back to Somerton Park but it had been systematically vandalised and thieved. Relish Every Sunday that summer the players went to Somerton Park to help with the painting. It was massive going back there. Hando A man by the name of Faulkner came from the Beazer Homes League to check the ground. He turned up in a Rolls Royce and just walked around shaking his head at everything. But when he came back a second time, he was full of praise. We had all these volunteers and donations, but it still cost us \u00a321,000 to get it up to standard. The only thing that Faulkner could fault us on then was the park goalposts. Then the club was on the move again \u2013 this time to Gloucester. Hando The FAW formed the League of Wales and invited us to join. The FAW would not allow us to carry on playing in the Beazer Homes League, in Wales, so we had to go into exile again.

It matters, even in politics. Without facts and verification, we slide into Trumpism, and I mean this next observation as a compliment: Scott Morrison, you are no Donald Trump.</p> \n<p>Morrison wants to make this issue a test of character with his political opponent, and that\u2019s fine, because politics is replete with testosterone-laden tedium of this nature \u2013 but for the sake of the voting public, I think this conversation also needs to be a test of truth, and who is prepared to tell it.</p> \n<p>It needs to be a test of truth just intrinsically, because without a set of agreed facts we all slide further into conflict and irresolvable contention, and the public square just becomes a cluster of snarling enclaves rather than a place where synthesis happens and the national interest is served.</p> \n<p>I don\u2019t want to live in that place. If we live in that place, representative politics has no mandate, and journalism is a pointless pursuit.</p> \n<p>But it also needs to be a test of truth because of the history of how this issue has been deployed on previous occasions in Australian politics when the general political atmosphere is heightened.</p> \n<p>The infamous \u201cchildren overboard\u201d incident of October 2001 is probably the most egregious example. If you are too young to remember the details, on 7 October of that year Philip Ruddock told the media that a number of children had been thrown overboard from a vessel intercepted by the defence force.</p> \n<p>John Howard repeated the story. Peter Reith, then defence minister said it. There was only one problem: it never happened.</p> \n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110112120215/http://aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/maritime_incident_ctte/report/a06.htm\">findings of a Senate inquiry</a>, Reith was informed by defence personnel in October and November that children were not thrown from the vessel. But Reith didn\u2019t inform Howard until 7 November, and \u201cdespite direct media questioning on the issue, no correction, retraction or communication about the existence of doubts in connection with either the alleged incident itself or the photographs as evidence for it was made by any member of the federal government before the election on 10 November 2001\u201d.</p> \n<p>I think this anecdote speaks for itself. It says, when it comes to politicians banging drums about border protection in the shadow of elections, journalists need to turn up to work, and voters need to be on high alert.</p>",

I mention the Tampa because it has been around in dispatches for much of this week, with commentators wondering whether Bill Shorten has just chalked up his Beazley moment, and lost the unlosable election by supporting the medical evacuations bill. Let\u2019s just state the obvious: despite all the chin-stroking and soothsaying on the rolling news channels, nobody yet knows whether this week will be seen down the track as a turning point in the major-party contest, or not. I don\u2019t have the certainty I had in 2001 that Labor has thrown away an election. What can be known is this. Labor has opened a point of difference with the government on the treatment of asylum seekers, although the point of difference, measured in substance as opposed to heightened political rhetoric, is not as massive as the government would have you believe. Conventional political wisdom says Labor saying something other than \u201cme too\u201d on asylum carries risks.

Polls suggest Australians are pretty angry with this particular government, and that resting disposition in the community makes it more difficult to mount a full-throated scare campaign and be believed by an audience fatigued with your shtick. I also think when you are the prime minister, with all the responsibilities of that office, it\u2019s a very fine line between projecting \u201cI\u2019m a manly man who will keep all the scary people away\u201d and looking like you are whistling up new boats for a bit of cheap partisan advantage five minutes before an election you are obviously worried about losing \u2013 which is what Morrison found himself being accused of this week. Now I\u2019m not saying that aggressively negative political campaigns don\u2019t work. They absolutely do. Look at the potency of Labor\u2019s \u201cMediscare\u201d campaign in the 2016 election.

But to work, you\u2019ve got to be believed on the fundamentals, and it\u2019s harder to be believed on the fundamentals when hyperbole substitutes for facts, as it did so often this week, with government people actively misleading the public about basic facts with the medical evacuations bill. So to summarise our situation report \u2013 a number of Australians are anxious in general, and distinctly wary about boat people in particular, but Australians also don\u2019t like being dished up self-serving bullshit by politicians. Now speaking of bullshit, I want to talk about truth. It matters, even in politics. Without facts and verification, we slide into Trumpism, and I mean this next observation as a compliment: Scott Morrison, you are no Donald Trump. Morrison wants to make this issue a test of character with his political opponent, and that\u2019s fine, because politics is replete with testosterone-laden tedium of this nature \u2013 but for the sake of the voting public, I think this conversation also needs to be a test of truth, and who is prepared to tell it. It needs to be a test of truth just intrinsically, because without a set of agreed facts we all slide further into conflict and irresolvable contention, and the public square just becomes a cluster of snarling enclaves rather than a place where synthesis happens and the national interest is served. I don\u2019t want to live in that place. If we live in that place, representative politics has no mandate, and journalism is a pointless pursuit. But it also needs to be a test of truth because of the history of how this issue has been deployed on previous occasions in Australian politics when the general political atmosphere is heightened. The infamous \u201cchildren overboard\u201d incident of October 2001 is probably the most egregious example. If you are too young to remember the details, on 7 October of that year Philip Ruddock told the media that a number of children had been thrown overboard from a vessel intercepted by the defence force. John Howard repeated the story. Peter Reith, then defence minister said it. There was only one problem: it never happened. According to the findings of a Senate inquiry, Reith was informed by defence personnel in October and November that children were not thrown from the vessel. But Reith didn\u2019t inform Howard until 7 November, and \u201cdespite direct media questioning on the issue, no correction, retraction or communication about the existence of doubts in connection with either the alleged incident itself or the photographs as evidence for it was made by any member of the federal government before the election on 10 November 2001\u201d. I think this anecdote speaks for itself. It says, when it comes to politicians banging drums about border protection in the shadow of elections, journalists need to turn up to work, and voters need to be on high alert.",

Previously, analysis showed a surge in the number of teenage girls and women in their early 20s was behind the dramatic rise. The admissions for those aged under 19 for anorexia went from 1,050 in 2010-11 to over 2,025 in 2016-17.</p> <p>\u201cRising hospital admissions show that outpatient services are failing to treat enough people with eating disorders soon enough. The government and NHS can readily address this by offering more intensive community care,\u201d said Beat\u2019s chief executive Andrew Radford.</p> <p>Dr Dasha Nicholls, chair of the eating disorders faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists said the increase in admissions could reflect one of three things: increases in numbers of people seeking treatment for eating disorders, increases in the severity of their illness, or a lack of community services to support people to be treated out of hospital. \u201cWe know that adult outpatient services are under-resourced and are therefore unable to meet the need for outpatient and day patient treatment adequately,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe also know that referrals to newly established and existing children and young people\u2019s community eating disorders services have been much higher than anticipated and resourced for, and are also increasing year on year.\u201d</p> <p>This point was reiterated by Matt Blow, policy manager at YoungMinds, who said the rise was \u201cworrying\u201d and a reminder of the importance of early intervention.</p> <p>Ilona Burton, an eating disorder campaigner and broadcaster, said over the last 10 years eating disorders have been spoken about more. She agreed the rise was due to \u201cmore awareness\u201d but also pointed to an increase in people experiencing problems due to societal pressures. \u201cA lot of it is also due to the pressure young people are under now \u2013 not so much social media, [but] exam pressure, pressure to perform \u2026 a lot of it is high achievers with eating disorders. Striving to perfectionism is a big issue,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The role of websites such as Instagram has also come under scrutiny.

Figures seen by the Guardian show year-on-year rises in hospital visits, with admission numbers more than doubling from 7,260 in 2010-11 to 16,023 in the year to April 2018. The latest figure is up from 13,885 the year before \u2013 the highest spike in eight years. Experts said the surge in numbers was down to the failure of NHS services to tackle anorexia and bulimia at an earlier stage, before people become so unwell that they need to be admitted to hospital. The figures, obtained by the Guardian from NHS Digital, come as the UK\u2019s leading eating disorder charity, Beat, said that calls to its helpline had surged from 17,000 in 2017-18 to an estimated 30,000 in 2018-19. Concern has also been raised about the number of young people experiencing problems due to exam and societal pressure, which can be exacerbated by social media. Over the last four decades, the reported prevalence of eating disorders has increased, although there is no indication as to whether this is due to more awareness of the problem or more people experiencing eating disorders. Beat estimates that there are more than 1.25m people with an eating disorder across the UK. The latest data shows that admissions with a primary or secondary diagnosis of an eating disorder are at their highest level in at least eight years. Previously, analysis showed a surge in the number of teenage girls and women in their early 20s was behind the dramatic rise. The admissions for those aged under 19 for anorexia went from 1,050 in 2010-11 to over 2,025 in 2016-17. \u201cRising hospital admissions show that outpatient services are failing to treat enough people with eating disorders soon enough. The government and NHS can readily address this by offering more intensive community care,\u201d said Beat\u2019s chief executive Andrew Radford. Dr Dasha Nicholls, chair of the eating disorders faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists said the increase in admissions could reflect one of three things: increases in numbers of people seeking treatment for eating disorders, increases in the severity of their illness, or a lack of community services to support people to be treated out of hospital. \u201cWe know that adult outpatient services are under-resourced and are therefore unable to meet the need for outpatient and day patient treatment adequately,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also know that referrals to newly established and existing children and young people\u2019s community eating disorders services have been much higher than anticipated and resourced for, and are also increasing year on year.\u201d This point was reiterated by Matt Blow, policy manager at YoungMinds, who said the rise was \u201cworrying\u201d and a reminder of the importance of early intervention. Ilona Burton, an eating disorder campaigner and broadcaster, said over the last 10 years eating disorders have been spoken about more. She agreed the rise was due to \u201cmore awareness\u201d but also pointed to an increase in people experiencing problems due to societal pressures. \u201cA lot of it is also due to the pressure young people are under now \u2013 not so much social media, [but] exam pressure, pressure to perform \u2026 a lot of it is high achievers with eating disorders. Striving to perfectionism is a big issue,\u201d she said. The role of websites such as Instagram has also come under scrutiny. Instagram was recently urged by experts to follow its self-harm picture ban with a focus on anorexia. The Guardian has discovered thousands of hashtags and accounts promoting anorexia, including diaries of weight loss, alarming pictures and comments on target weights. Research conducted for the Guardian by Jennifer Grygiel, a social media expert and assistant professor of communications at Syracuse University, showed there were 3.4m images and posts under terms \u201canorexia\u201d or \u201cthinspiration\u201d over the past year. This included 13,700 on Facebook, 2.1m on Twitter and 560,000 Instagram posts. Instagram, in particular, said it would focus on removing graphic images of self-harm as part of a series of changes made in response to the death of British teenager Molly Russell. The 14-year-old committed suicide and her father Ian Russell said he believed the social media site was partly to blame. The family found material relating to depression and suicide on her account after her death. Instagram is understood to be continuing to review its policies. Its focus on images of cutting is based on recent reviews carried out with experts who viewed them as holding the biggest potential to unintentionally promote self-harm. However, leading charities and experts said Instagram did not go far enough and young people also faced being confronted with pro-anorexia images due to inadequate policing on the site. Grygiel said: \u201cSocial media platforms are being used around the world to not just build supportive communities for those struggling with eating disorders, but also to openly promote ideas such as pro-anorexia.\u201d \u201cWe need these global platforms, especially Instagram, to take more proactive steps to stop social media from hurting people, especially teens who are looking more and more to unmonitored content on Instagram as they construct their identity and understanding of societal beauty norms and aesthetics.\u201d An NHS England spokesperson said: \u201cMore people than ever before are receiving treatment for eating disorders quickly and closer to home, with NHS England investing an extra \u00a330m every year and as part of the long term plan, the NHS is firmly on track to meet ambitious targets to treat children and young people, with 70 community treatment teams covering the whole of the country.\u201d Research contributed by Jennifer M.

I\u2019ve watched them about 20 times already \u2013 probably more. This will sound bad but seeing it back I just thought: \u2018Wow, that\u2019s me.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t believe how well I bowled and how fast it looked on TV. I was so happy.\u201d</p> \n<p>Wood\u2019s recall in St Lucia may have come too late for the series, with a resurgent West Indies side having already taken a 2-0 lead. But first-innings figures of five for 41 that propelled Joe Root\u2019s side to a 232-run consolation win were more than just the numbers in the scorebook.</p> \n<p>In his initial 19-ball burst before tea on the second day, one that dispatched Shai Hope, Roston Chase and Shimron Hetmyer, Wood ensured the clouded Test leg of this tour would end with a significant silver lining; his slippery pace, something many feared had been sliced away by three bouts of ankle surgery, was back.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>His first delivery was clocked at 88mph and the follow-up at 90. When Hetmyer survived his hat-trick ball, the speedgun hit 94.6mph. The crowd was transfixed, a usually busy England dressing room stopped in its tracks and the slips appeared closer to the sightscreen than the stumps. The sense from Wood was that the batsmen wished they were too.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou could see their batsmen coming in and looking more nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cHetmyer had attacked our bowlers from the outset in the first two Tests. I expected more of the same and when he didn\u2019t I thought: \u2018I\u2019ve got him here. I\u2019m on top of him.\u2019 As soon as you feel like that it\u2019s like: \u2018Right, any ball I can get a wicket.\u2019 I was so in the zone too, I didn\u2019t know my field.

Nevertheless, after two tough Tests for England\u2019s batsmen, he loved switching the panic over to the opposition, as he had done <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/14/jason-roy-england-highest-odi-score-five-wicket-australia-cricket\" title=\"\">in Australia last winter</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019d been with the Test squad towards the end of the Ashes and the lads had got peppered. So when the ODIs came, I told them: \u2018Right, I\u2019m going to hit David Warner in the head first ball\u2019 and I was pretty much on the money. A few came over after I got him out a couple of balls later and said the mood had changed. I wanted to have that same impact here.</p> \n<p>\u201cWest Indies had put our batters under the pump. But I always watch the home team\u2019s bowlers \u2013 after all, they know the conditions \u2013 and with Kemar Roach closer to my height [6ft] and Shannon Gabriel the pace I aim for, I took bits from both. Starting well was important. They suddenly thought \u2018he\u2019s on it here\u2019 and it changed the mood again.\u201d</p> \n<p>After completing his five-wicket haul, spearing a yorker into Gabriel\u2019s stumps at the start of his second spell, Wood wheeled away in delight, before snaffling the match ball, kissing it for the crowd and yomping back to a delighted England dressing room.</p> \n<p>\u201cI held the ball up and felt so proud, then I got into the pavilion, had hug with the physio Craig de Weymarn \u2013 he\u2019s touched me in places my wife never has! \u2013 and it all sunk in. It was everything I\u2019d wanted after all I\u2019d been through with injury. I know it\u2019s only one five-fer and there\u2019s Jimmy and Broady with tons of them, but it was so special. I felt I finally belonged in the England Test team. I put the ball in my England cap, sat them next to me and just looked at them. All the emotions came out. I was a bit teary.\u201d</p> \n<p>Wood wants to be known for more than just pace and noted the left-handers removed \u2013 Hetmyer and Darren Bravo \u2013 were done by away movement off the deck, something he and Chris Silverwood had worked on. Wood gushed about the support of the entire England team and staff, not least the psychologist, David Young, who has worked on his self-esteem and taught him to focus on the process of bowling, not the outcome. Sarah, whom he married in December, has been his rock off the field, while the good folk at Durham deserve England\u2019s gratitude as ever.</p> \n<p>All this support was needed. Having played only 12 Tests since his debut four years ago, Wood struggled and after his third ankle operation in late 2016, briefly lost his love for cricket. The key was last winter when he learned to push through bowling with niggles to gain physical confidence. A strong Lions tour to the UAE last November led to his recall. It followed a sit down with Trevor Bayliss in Sri Lanka before Christmas, where he had played only one ODI.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cTrevor gave me some harsh truths,\u201d Wood says. \u201cHe wanted more \u2018Aussie mongrel\u2019 in us, to have good body language, go to the Lions, prove I\u2019m a step above them.

      "bodyText": "What is it like to bowl at 95mph? For Mark Wood, whose scorching return to England\u2019s Test team sent everyone a bit gaga in St Lucia, the answer is wonderfully simple: \u201cYou almost feel like a superhero. I\u2019ve been playing Mario Kart recently and yeah, it\u2019s like when you get a magic mushroom and you\u2019re just absolutely flying.\u201d It will come as little surprise to learn Wood is still glowing from victory in the third Test against West Indies and his maiden five-wicket haul. The 29-year-old sat down for a chat this week and, in that inimitable Ashington twang, his delight at finally becoming a match-winner shone through. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the feeling of that spell,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m ever down about my bowling I\u2019ll rewatch the highlights. I\u2019ve watched them about 20 times already \u2013 probably more. This will sound bad but seeing it back I just thought: \u2018Wow, that\u2019s me.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t believe how well I bowled and how fast it looked on TV. I was so happy.\u201d Wood\u2019s recall in St Lucia may have come too late for the series, with a resurgent West Indies side having already taken a 2-0 lead. But first-innings figures of five for 41 that propelled Joe Root\u2019s side to a 232-run consolation win were more than just the numbers in the scorebook. In his initial 19-ball burst before tea on the second day, one that dispatched Shai Hope, Roston Chase and Shimron Hetmyer, Wood ensured the clouded Test leg of this tour would end with a significant silver lining; his slippery pace, something many feared had been sliced away by three bouts of ankle surgery, was back. His first delivery was clocked at 88mph and the follow-up at 90. When Hetmyer survived his hat-trick ball, the speedgun hit 94.6mph. The crowd was transfixed, a usually busy England dressing room stopped in its tracks and the slips appeared closer to the sightscreen than the stumps. The sense from Wood was that the batsmen wished they were too. \u201cYou could see their batsmen coming in and looking more nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cHetmyer had attacked our bowlers from the outset in the first two Tests. I expected more of the same and when he didn\u2019t I thought: \u2018I\u2019ve got him here. I\u2019m on top of him.\u2019 As soon as you feel like that it\u2019s like: \u2018Right, any ball I can get a wicket.\u2019 I was so in the zone too, I didn\u2019t know my field. I was just so focused on the batsman.\u201d Wood winces when reminded about his cheeky comment to TalkSport that Hetmyer had \u201ctwo feet in the toilet\u201d before edging a 91mph lifter through to first slip (a catch that left Root\u2019s hands burning) as he admires the Guyanese left-hander. Nevertheless, after two tough Tests for England\u2019s batsmen, he loved switching the panic over to the opposition, as he had done in Australia last winter. \u201cI\u2019d been with the Test squad towards the end of the Ashes and the lads had got peppered. So when the ODIs came, I told them: \u2018Right, I\u2019m going to hit David Warner in the head first ball\u2019 and I was pretty much on the money. A few came over after I got him out a couple of balls later and said the mood had changed. I wanted to have that same impact here. \u201cWest Indies had put our batters under the pump. But I always watch the home team\u2019s bowlers \u2013 after all, they know the conditions \u2013 and with Kemar Roach closer to my height [6ft] and Shannon Gabriel the pace I aim for, I took bits from both. Starting well was important. They suddenly thought \u2018he\u2019s on it here\u2019 and it changed the mood again.\u201d After completing his five-wicket haul, spearing a yorker into Gabriel\u2019s stumps at the start of his second spell, Wood wheeled away in delight, before snaffling the match ball, kissing it for the crowd and yomping back to a delighted England dressing room. \u201cI held the ball up and felt so proud, then I got into the pavilion, had hug with the physio Craig de Weymarn \u2013 he\u2019s touched me in places my wife never has! \u2013 and it all sunk in. It was everything I\u2019d wanted after all I\u2019d been through with injury. I know it\u2019s only one five-fer and there\u2019s Jimmy and Broady with tons of them, but it was so special. I felt I finally belonged in the England Test team. I put the ball in my England cap, sat them next to me and just looked at them. All the emotions came out. I was a bit teary.\u201d Wood wants to be known for more than just pace and noted the left-handers removed \u2013 Hetmyer and Darren Bravo \u2013 were done by away movement off the deck, something he and Chris Silverwood had worked on. Wood gushed about the support of the entire England team and staff, not least the psychologist, David Young, who has worked on his self-esteem and taught him to focus on the process of bowling, not the outcome. Sarah, whom he married in December, has been his rock off the field, while the good folk at Durham deserve England\u2019s gratitude as ever. All this support was needed. Having played only 12 Tests since his debut four years ago, Wood struggled and after his third ankle operation in late 2016, briefly lost his love for cricket. The key was last winter when he learned to push through bowling with niggles to gain physical confidence. A strong Lions tour to the UAE last November led to his recall. It followed a sit down with Trevor Bayliss in Sri Lanka before Christmas, where he had played only one ODI. \u201cTrevor gave me some harsh truths,\u201d Wood says. \u201cHe wanted more \u2018Aussie mongrel\u2019 in us, to have good body language, go to the Lions, prove I\u2019m a step above them. I trained smart, focused on the processes [that Young taught me] and things clicked. I have had some mental scars but coming back into Test cricket, I felt so ready. That\u2019s the definition of freedom, not even thinking about it \u2013 just bowling.\u201d Making England\u2019s World Cup squad is certainly a goal, with the five one-dayers against West Indies that start on Wednesday a final chance to impress before the provisional group are selected. Wood knows competition is high and, as regards the first XI, he feels he is battling Tom Curran and David Willey for one spot. \u201cAdd one more with Jofra Archer too,\u201d says Wood, in reference to the Barbados-born quick who is soon to qualify for England duty. \u201cBut the competition pushes everyone. I\u2019m desperate to play in a World Cup in England. I believe we\u2019ve got the best team and I\u2019d love to be a part of that.\u201d Given the deluge of messages he received from well-wishers this week, and an England team delighted to have finally returned fire against West Indies on tour, he is probably not alone.",

      "body": "<p>Cuts to the legal aid budget since 2010, coupled with the impact of other spending cuts on low-income and vulnerable people, mean that increasing numbers of people are arriving in court in difficult personal circumstances, having received no legal advice and with no lawyer to represent them. The number of people accessing legal aid fell by 82% between 2010 and 2018. While lawyers, charities and others have repeatedly complained about the impact of legal aid cuts in both civil and criminal courts, and criminal barristers last year threatened to strike, the government has so far declined to reverse the funding decisions taken in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>Last week ministers completed a long-awaited review of the Legal aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act (Laspo), and announced it will spend an additional \u00a36.5m on restoring help in a few areas from where it was removed. Given the extent of the cuts \u2013 \u00a3950m has been sliced from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/dec/26/legal-aid-how-has-it-changed-in-70-years\" title=\"\">total budget</a> since 2010, with the amount falling from \u00a32.5bn to \u00a31.6bn in real terms \u2013 critics were unimpressed. While the extra money can be expected to ease the situation for a small minority of litigants, for the majority nothing will change.</p> <p>There is a clear public interest in understanding how the courts have been affected by cuts, especially in handling disputes over housing, immigration or benefits. One of the most serious areas of concern is family law. Parents are entitled to legal aid in care cases, but not in disputes between ex-partners over access (unless they have proof of domestic violence), meaning that some simply give up. In 2017, more than a third of family court hearings saw both parties appearing without representation.</p> <p>Last month the Liberal Democrat former justice minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/30/lord-mcnally-cut-legal-aid-mps-justice-system\" title=\"\">Tom McNally told the Guardian</a> that he believes it was right for the coalition to seek to reduce the amount of taxpayer-funded litigation and promote mediation instead. But as the level of cuts has increased far beyond the original target of \u00a3350m, the evidence of unintended and harmful effects has increased. </p> <p>This makes it all the more essential that it is possible to scrutinise what is happening in family courts.

      "bodyText": "Cuts to the legal aid budget since 2010, coupled with the impact of other spending cuts on low-income and vulnerable people, mean that increasing numbers of people are arriving in court in difficult personal circumstances, having received no legal advice and with no lawyer to represent them. The number of people accessing legal aid fell by 82% between 2010 and 2018. While lawyers, charities and others have repeatedly complained about the impact of legal aid cuts in both civil and criminal courts, and criminal barristers last year threatened to strike, the government has so far declined to reverse the funding decisions taken in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Last week ministers completed a long-awaited review of the Legal aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act (Laspo), and announced it will spend an additional \u00a36.5m on restoring help in a few areas from where it was removed. Given the extent of the cuts \u2013 \u00a3950m has been sliced from the total budget since 2010, with the amount falling from \u00a32.5bn to \u00a31.6bn in real terms \u2013 critics were unimpressed. While the extra money can be expected to ease the situation for a small minority of litigants, for the majority nothing will change. There is a clear public interest in understanding how the courts have been affected by cuts, especially in handling disputes over housing, immigration or benefits. One of the most serious areas of concern is family law. Parents are entitled to legal aid in care cases, but not in disputes between ex-partners over access (unless they have proof of domestic violence), meaning that some simply give up. In 2017, more than a third of family court hearings saw both parties appearing without representation. Last month the Liberal Democrat former justice minister Tom McNally told the Guardian that he believes it was right for the coalition to seek to reduce the amount of taxpayer-funded litigation and promote mediation instead. But as the level of cuts has increased far beyond the original target of \u00a3350m, the evidence of unintended and harmful effects has increased. This makes it all the more essential that it is possible to scrutinise what is happening in family courts. Difficult questions about the reporting of family law must be addressed. There are very tough restrictions on what can be reported in cases involving children. That is understandable. No one wants a free-for-all. But it is becoming clearer that more transparency is needed. Ten years ago, journalists won the right to report on family court proceedings under certain conditions. But the promised new era of openness never materialised. There are a variety of reasons for this, some of them good ones. Reporting on family law is difficult, and resources are limited.

The dread, for those with small children, is prompted by the endless viewings, deluge of merchandise and earsplitting singing that lie in store with the release of a follow-up to Disney\u2019s blockbuster Frozen later this year. The trailer offered the first, teasing glimpse of that sequel.</p> <p>The original is the highest grossing musical and animation ever, earning $1.3bn at the box office since its release six years ago and vast sums via associated paraphernalia. No wonder Disney wouldn\u2019t let it go. It is \u201ca generational set text\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/13/frozen-mania-elsa-anna-olaf-disney-emo-princess-let-it-go\" title=\"\">wrote</a> a Guardian critic: it is to its younger and mostly but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/30/disneyland-apologises-for-banning-boy-from-princess-experience\" title=\"\">by no means solely</a> female audience what Star Wars was to teenage boys. Very loosely inspired by a Hans Christian Andersen story, it follows a snow queen who freezes the land and a brave young girl who risks her life to bring back the warmth.</p> <p>This is a Disney princess movie that inverts or demolishes most of the tropes of that genre, and does so well and wittily enough that many will welcome its sequel. Though there had already been a broader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/09/why-prince-charming-is-all-out-of-happily-ever-afters\" title=\"\">shift away</a> from classic fairytale storylines, Frozen proved beyond question that it is possible to make a hugely popular movie that eschews stereotypes and takes self-realisation, and the love between sisters Elsa and Anna, as seriously as romance.</p> <p>The parameters of princesshood were once so narrow that The Little Mermaid, in which the heroine is literally voiceless for much of the action, was considered progress. It is not coincidental that Frozen was the first Disney full-length animated feature directed by a woman, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2014/film/awards/frozens-jennifer-lee-melts-ceilings-1201216961/\" title=\"\">Jennifer Lee</a>, and that Kristen Anderson-Lopez, who co-wrote the songs with her husband, shares her feminist sympathies.</p> <p>Frozen has its disappointments: notably the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/05/frozen-elsa-dress-menace-disney-stereotypes\" title=\"\">Barbiefication</a> of Elsa as she comes into her own. Unlike the more recent Disney heroine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/04/moana-review-disney\" title=\"\">Moana</a>, the sisters are white and wasp-waisted. But this is a movie that, as those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/04/frozen-elsa-first-lesbian-disney-princess-lgbt\" title=\"\">campaigning for a girlfriend for Elsa</a> noted, embraces difference and shows the damage caused by shame and concealment.

      "bodyText": "This week, two minutes of video struck both terror and cheer into the hearts of parents worldwide. The dread, for those with small children, is prompted by the endless viewings, deluge of merchandise and earsplitting singing that lie in store with the release of a follow-up to Disney\u2019s blockbuster Frozen later this year. The trailer offered the first, teasing glimpse of that sequel. The original is the highest grossing musical and animation ever, earning $1.3bn at the box office since its release six years ago and vast sums via associated paraphernalia. No wonder Disney wouldn\u2019t let it go. It is \u201ca generational set text\u201d, wrote a Guardian critic: it is to its younger and mostly but by no means solely female audience what Star Wars was to teenage boys. Very loosely inspired by a Hans Christian Andersen story, it follows a snow queen who freezes the land and a brave young girl who risks her life to bring back the warmth. This is a Disney princess movie that inverts or demolishes most of the tropes of that genre, and does so well and wittily enough that many will welcome its sequel. Though there had already been a broader shift away from classic fairytale storylines, Frozen proved beyond question that it is possible to make a hugely popular movie that eschews stereotypes and takes self-realisation, and the love between sisters Elsa and Anna, as seriously as romance. The parameters of princesshood were once so narrow that The Little Mermaid, in which the heroine is literally voiceless for much of the action, was considered progress. It is not coincidental that Frozen was the first Disney full-length animated feature directed by a woman, Jennifer Lee, and that Kristen Anderson-Lopez, who co-wrote the songs with her husband, shares her feminist sympathies. Frozen has its disappointments: notably the Barbiefication of Elsa as she comes into her own. Unlike the more recent Disney heroine Moana, the sisters are white and wasp-waisted. But this is a movie that, as those campaigning for a girlfriend for Elsa noted, embraces difference and shows the damage caused by shame and concealment. These are princesses who do the rescuing, learn to love their power, and wonder whether they\u2019re \u201celated or gassy\u201d. The handsome prince who sweeps you off your feet may be a frog. The companion who has your back is a better bet, but not the be-all and end-all. Your relationship with yourself, or your sister, may be more important. Frozen doesn\u2019t just pass the Bechdel test with flying colours. It even rejects the Manichaean worldview of classic Disney movies: \u201cPeople make bad choices if they\u2019re mad, or scared, or stressed.\u201d In another movie Elsa would be the villain. We will soon find out whether what comes after Frozen\u2019s happy ever after proves as pleasing to audiences. It will be a relief if the sequel lives up to the boldness of the original \u2013 and better still if Hollywood takes note of its lessons when producing movies for grown-ups, too.",

      "bodyText": "Chris Smalling can draw on his own challenging childhood when talking to the pupils of Salford City Academy. He is there as the new patron of Football Beyond Borders, a charity that hopes to provide stability and hope for disadvantaged youngsters. Smalling\u2019s glittering career shows how difficult beginnings can be overcome. The 29-year-old lost his father as a child and was raised on a council estate, the family requiring social security. \u201cI grew up with my mother and brother and was in education to 18, so I feel hopefully I can relate to them all,\u201d he says, speaking at the comprehensive school the day after Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s team lost 2-0 to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. \u201cFootball was always a dream, but a distant dream until when I was about to go to university. I\u2019d had a couple of trials, but it wasn\u2019t a realistic dream, it was a kid\u2019s dream.\u201d Smalling made his debut for non-league Maidstone United at 17. \u201cI was going to go to Loughborough University to do financial economics,\u201d he says. \u201cI was five weeks away from doing that. I don\u2019t think I would be a footballer if I had.\u201d This experience informs Smalling\u2019s message that anything is possible. \u201cI\u2019ve had many setbacks,\u201d he says. \u201cEven when I was 11 and not getting [selected] for my county or having setbacks later in my career or in life in general. It\u2019s about kids having a dream and seeing a pathway to realise that. \u201cThat\u2019s massively important with this programme \u2013 when you speak to the young kids, they have dreams but a lot of people say: \u2018It\u2019s impossible.\u2019 So I think it\u2019s about never giving up, which [is an attitude] I had. Football Beyond Borders is about learning, establishing new beliefs in an ability to succeed.\u201d Under Solskj\u00e6r, United are on an upward curve too, despite the last-16 first-leg loss to PSG. They remain unbeaten in the league under the Norwegian, having risen to fourth place in attacking style, and face Chelsea in the FA Cup fifth round on Monday. Having signed for Sir Alex Ferguson in January 2010, Smalling believes United are exciting to watch again for the first time since the Scot retired six years ago. \u201cDefinitely. Even my own family and friends, and people who stop you in the street, say there is that feelgood factor again. It\u2019s going through the team and that translates to the fans.\u201d Smalling believes United are feared once more. \u201cI hope so and I think it probably is [true],\u201d he says. \u201cConfidence has been good the last couple of months \u2013 you can sense if you give us a lot of chances we\u2019ll score a lot of goals, and that\u2019s that fear factor. Obviously PSG is that step up in the Champions League that we need consistency for. \u201cBut we\u2019re definitely feeling that Old Trafford fear factor and teams come now where they are maybe relying on getting a draw or a lucky result, whereas before they had more hope of a win.\u201d Smalling points to the FA Cup as silverware still available for United and he targets a starting place at Stamford Bridge. \u201cIt was nice to have my first game back on Saturday [the win at Fulham].

Those involved in the organisation are understood to have conducted significant polling, including in target constituencies.</p> <p>\u201cI honestly believe this is imminent. You will see the values emphasised first, rather than policies to help people make that change. There are the names that are public but others are involved, including in the organisation of it, who have never been named,\u201d the MP said.</p> <p>Labour strategists say they are relaxed about a potential breakaway, arguing that the figures involved are unlikely to be of the political standing of the four former cabinet members who helped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/24/labour-party-split-sdp-tories-england\">found the Social Democratic party</a> in 1981.</p> <p>They also believe there is a firm majority in the shadow cabinet against a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d and continue to hope May will ultimately be forced to soften her red lines and shift towards something more like the form of Brexit they have proposed.</p> <p>The Momentum founder, Jon Lansman, issued a stark warning to MPs considering leaving the party that their project would be rejected by voters. \u201cChris Leslie, Chuka Umunna and Gavin Shuker are marginal figures with marginal politics,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is very different to the SDP breakaway in 1981. I was there, and I remember at least a certain level of public support for their policies. The situation is completely different now. Socialism has gone mainstream, a Blairite programme has no support amongst the public and parties pursuing similar programmes across Europe have seen their vote share plummet.\u201d</p> <p>Some in Labour appear to be goading the grouping to split. On Thursday, Momentum released a spoof Valentine\u2019s Day video aimed at Umunna, set to the song Please Don\u2019t Go. It urged him to stay in the party, but concluded: \u201cIf you go we\u2019re keeping the house xxx.\u201d</p> <p>Local Lib Dem parties in some constituencies, such as Wavertree and Totnes where it has a presence, have been told to be receptive if any MP were to quit Labour or the Conservatives, even if they do so to sit in Westminster as an independent.</p> <p>Party insiders say the Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, could step down after the local elections in May, creating a vacancy for a leader of any new movement. They, too, have been studying the history of the SDP and say the Lib Dems could be open to anything from a full merger to an alliance or supporting independent candidates.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Intense discussions are taking place at Westminster that could lead to the emergence of a new centrist party consisting of six or more disaffected anti-Brexit Labour MPs along with the involvement of some Conservatives and the backing of the Liberal Democrats. Labour MPs reported that some of those involved had lobbied backbench colleagues they thought were sympathetic as to how they could \u201cmake the shift\u201d away from a tribal loyalty to the party. The argument put forward was that the set of values that had drawn them to the Labour party, such as European solidarity, free movement, liberalism and anti-racism, could now be found elsewhere. Those involved in the talks say frustrations over pro-Brexit policies pursued by Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May, coupled with Labour-specific concerns about antisemitism, have taken a handful of MPs to the point where they are seriously considering quitting. Labour MPs at the centre of the discussions include Chris Leslie, Chuka Umunna, Angela Smith and Gavin Shuker, signalling their intention to ratchet up the pressure on Corbyn in the hope he will whip his MPs to back an amendment calling for a second referendum. \u201cIt\u2019s time to start to make them realise that this is existential for the leadership,\u201d said one potential splitter. Luciana Berger has also been seriously considering her position as a Labour MP because of her dissatisfaction at the party\u2019s approach to Brexit and the handling of antisemitism cases. Close friends within Labour have been trying to persuade Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree, to stay over recent days. Some party colleagues say that if she were to go it could represent a tipping point. Conservative MPs considering their futures, according to those involved in the talks, include Sarah Wollaston, the MP for Totnes, Anna Soubry, the MP for Broxtowe, and Heidi Allen, who represents South Cambridgeshire. The three have cooperated closely with Labour MPs as part of the People\u2019s Vote second referendum campaign, and were all lead signatories of an amendment on Thursday that forced the government to agree to release no-deal cabinet documents. Those involved in the discussions believe that a crunch point could come at the end of February, when pro-EU Labour MPs desperately want Corbyn to back a second referendum and restless Conservatives want May to rule out no deal if she cannot get a revised Brexit agreement through parliament. A source in the People\u2019s Vote campaign said: \u201cWhatever happens, it is important to emphasise this is nothing to do with our campaign which is strictly and proudly non-partisan, involving supporters from all parties and none.\u201d Another idea circulating is that the new group could be called the Reformist party, with the Lib Dems contributing national and local resources. \u201cThere are a lot of generals here without an army \u2013 well the Lib Dems have an army of members,\u201d one MP involved said. A Labour MP contacted by members of the group said he believed there were around a dozen MPs in his party close to quitting. Those involved in the organisation are understood to have conducted significant polling, including in target constituencies. \u201cI honestly believe this is imminent. You will see the values emphasised first, rather than policies to help people make that change. There are the names that are public but others are involved, including in the organisation of it, who have never been named,\u201d the MP said. Labour strategists say they are relaxed about a potential breakaway, arguing that the figures involved are unlikely to be of the political standing of the four former cabinet members who helped found the Social Democratic party in 1981. They also believe there is a firm majority in the shadow cabinet against a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d and continue to hope May will ultimately be forced to soften her red lines and shift towards something more like the form of Brexit they have proposed. The Momentum founder, Jon Lansman, issued a stark warning to MPs considering leaving the party that their project would be rejected by voters. \u201cChris Leslie, Chuka Umunna and Gavin Shuker are marginal figures with marginal politics,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is very different to the SDP breakaway in 1981. I was there, and I remember at least a certain level of public support for their policies. The situation is completely different now. Socialism has gone mainstream, a Blairite programme has no support amongst the public and parties pursuing similar programmes across Europe have seen their vote share plummet.\u201d Some in Labour appear to be goading the grouping to split. On Thursday, Momentum released a spoof Valentine\u2019s Day video aimed at Umunna, set to the song Please Don\u2019t Go. It urged him to stay in the party, but concluded: \u201cIf you go we\u2019re keeping the house xxx.\u201d Local Lib Dem parties in some constituencies, such as Wavertree and Totnes where it has a presence, have been told to be receptive if any MP were to quit Labour or the Conservatives, even if they do so to sit in Westminster as an independent. Party insiders say the Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, could step down after the local elections in May, creating a vacancy for a leader of any new movement. They, too, have been studying the history of the SDP and say the Lib Dems could be open to anything from a full merger to an alliance or supporting independent candidates.",

The young people taking part in Friday\u2019s strike called on the government to declare a climate emergency, communicate the severity of the ecological crisis and change the curriculum to make the state of the environment an educational priority. They also want recognition that since young people have the biggest stake in the future they should be involved in policymaking, and are demanding that the voting age be lowered to 16.

The coastal town of Llanelli near Swansea is being targeted by gangs from Birmingham and Liverpool selling drugs like crack and heroin. Organised crime groups have been sending dealers \u2013 often youngsters with no criminal records to avoid suspicion \u2013 to the town. The details emerged at the sentencing of a teenager who was sent to Llanelli to sell crack cocaine by a criminal gang. Cameron Davy, 18, from Birmingham was found in a block of flats at Clos Dewi Medi in Morfa, Llanelli with 29 wraps of the class A drug and \u00a31,132 in cash on 10 January. Swansea crown court heard that police knew the teenager was from the Birmingham area and believed he may have been linked to a county lines operation. Jim Davis, prosecuting, said when officers analysed the defendant\u2019s phone they found numerous texts relating to drug deals over the preceding weeks and messages that showed he had regular contact with a criminal drugs gang known to police as the \u201cMarco line.\u201d Davy, of Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, pleaded guilty to possession of crack cocaine with intent to supply and to possessing criminal property. The court heard he had no previous convictions. Kate Williams, for Davy, said her client\u2019s dealing had lasted a \u201ccouple of weeks\u201d and he had been due to be paid \u00a3300 for his trip to Llanelli. She said the defendant was very much at the bottom of the chain of command of the gang and had declined to name those who had sent him to Carmarthenshire. The barrister said when Davy\u2019s mother had received the phone call to say her son was in custody she had no idea where Llanelli was, let alone why he was there. Williams added that gangs tended to use people with no previous convictions to do their work because they were less likely to come to the attention of police. Recorder Simon Mills sentenced Davy to two years and four months in youth detention. In January this year, county lines drug dealer Jerome Wallis, 20, was jailed for eight years after admitting abducting a 15-year-old boy from London to sell drugs in Swansea. Jerome Wallis, 20, of Southwark, London admitted arranging or facilitating the travel of a child with a view to exploit, contrary to the Modern Slavery Act 2015. That conviction was the first of its kind in Wales and only the second in the UK, according to South Wales police.",

Furthermore, Baker complained: \u201cI really do rather object to being called \u2018hardline\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Oh dear. Given the need to find alternative arrangements for describing Steve Baker, let\u2019s look at technological solutions. It\u2019s as if someone had half an idea to build a fun, geeky robot sidekick for Jacob Rees-Mogg, then became so bored or repulsed by the task that they gave up before they\u2019d fitted him with a cool metallic exoskeleton. Somehow, the unfinished unit picked itself off the workshop floor and found its way to parliament. By rights, Steve Baker is just the innards of something that \u2013 had it been completed \u2013 you might find in the background of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/03/star-wars-abandoned-tunisian-locations-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Mos Espa</a> docking-bay scene in The Phantom Menace. Instead, he\u2019s one of the fanatics holding our national destiny in his partially assembled hands. The more versatile politicians of this golden age have two expressions; Steve Baker has one. Steve Baker\u2019s sole expression is cocking his head slightly to the side as if to say \u201cI\u2019m listening politely and reasonably\u201d, when what he is actually saying is, \u201cLet\u2019s just fucking burn it all down and see what happens.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Williamson sees Grayling get a Calais asbo, and promptly gets trade talks with China cancelled. Game recognise game</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And so to Thursday\u2019s vote in parliament \u2013 another absolute el cl\u00e1sico. To be able to watch these two sides at the peak of their talents is to \u2026 nope, I\u2019m sorry, can\u2019t go on with that one. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho once advanced to a Champions League final after a match in which his side had just 19% of possession, and May\u2019s Brexit strategy has always pinned its hopes on something similar. In vain. Unfortunately, to put it in terms both would instinctively understand, Rees-Mogg has been imposed on May as director of football.</p> <p>Along with the rest of the ERG, Rees-Mogg and Baker are still claiming the solution is the Malthouse compromise. This is easily the most ludicrously far-fetched one in the whole franchise. If you\u2019re keeping rankings, it goes: The Malthouse Ultimatum, The Malthouse Identity, The Malthouse Supremacy, The Malthouse Legacy, then lastly The Malthouse Compromise. Shouldn\u2019t even place.</p> <p>If the circumstances were less deadly serious, British politics would resemble one of those terrible British comedies whose opening-weekend box office is \u00a3345, and later turns out to have been designed solely as a complex investment vehicle designed to liberate Gary Barlow from his tax obligations. Unsurprisingly, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/14/project-fur-brexit-is-a-big-blue-monster-say-the-dutch\" title=\"\">Dutch foreign minister</a> this week spoke of growing dismay in European capitals. You might remember the EU butter mountain and the EU wine lake; say hello to the EU dismay ocean. We\u2019re drowning in it.</p> <p>Maybe a passing ferry will save us? In Greek mythology, you paid the ferryman to cross the River Styx. Brexit mythology is more complex. There is no ferryman \u2013 indeed, there are no ferries \u2013 but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/13/no-written-guarantee-before-ferry-contract-awarded-says-official\" title=\"\">Chris Grayling</a> pays \u00a3800,000 to management consultants to get told this, and somehow doesn\u2019t go to hell. The transport secretary won\u2019t even be going to Calais, having been told he wasn\u2019t welcome at the port last week by its chairman.</p> <p>Or perhaps a warship will save us? On Monday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/11/gavin-williamson-enhances-reputation-for-haplessness\" title=\"\">Gavin Williamson</a> \u2013 who bagsied the role of Iceman in the year 9 Top Gun musical \u2013 threatened to send a warship to China.

It\u2019s always encouraging to hear Corbyn boosters honk about how much they\u2019d expect him to put on in a campaign situation. The slightly incredulous response has to be: um, yes?! I should hope so?! I mean, you would hope that anyone might improve on losing to a party that is essentially a gif of someone lighting their own fart and then being consumed by the fireball. Against that sort of competition, you would expect to be able to run one of the more divisive Sesame Street Muppets \u2013 ie Elmo \u2013 and put on a few points.

Just to be clear, Prime Minister, on Thursday a party colleague requested an emergency parliamentary debate on Winston Churchill, who literally DIED IN 1965.

      "bodyText": "Where are you on Steve Baker, on a scale of one to so-completely-over-him? The deputy chair of the European Research Group took to the airwaves today to warn mildly that parliament passing Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement would \u201ccollapse the government\u201d. Furthermore, Baker complained: \u201cI really do rather object to being called \u2018hardline\u2019.\u201d Oh dear. Given the need to find alternative arrangements for describing Steve Baker, let\u2019s look at technological solutions. It\u2019s as if someone had half an idea to build a fun, geeky robot sidekick for Jacob Rees-Mogg, then became so bored or repulsed by the task that they gave up before they\u2019d fitted him with a cool metallic exoskeleton. Somehow, the unfinished unit picked itself off the workshop floor and found its way to parliament. By rights, Steve Baker is just the innards of something that \u2013 had it been completed \u2013 you might find in the background of a Mos Espa docking-bay scene in The Phantom Menace. Instead, he\u2019s one of the fanatics holding our national destiny in his partially assembled hands. The more versatile politicians of this golden age have two expressions; Steve Baker has one. Steve Baker\u2019s sole expression is cocking his head slightly to the side as if to say \u201cI\u2019m listening politely and reasonably\u201d, when what he is actually saying is, \u201cLet\u2019s just fucking burn it all down and see what happens.\u201d And so to Thursday\u2019s vote in parliament \u2013 another absolute el cl\u00e1sico. To be able to watch these two sides at the peak of their talents is to \u2026 nope, I\u2019m sorry, can\u2019t go on with that one. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho once advanced to a Champions League final after a match in which his side had just 19% of possession, and May\u2019s Brexit strategy has always pinned its hopes on something similar. In vain. Unfortunately, to put it in terms both would instinctively understand, Rees-Mogg has been imposed on May as director of football. Along with the rest of the ERG, Rees-Mogg and Baker are still claiming the solution is the Malthouse compromise. This is easily the most ludicrously far-fetched one in the whole franchise. If you\u2019re keeping rankings, it goes: The Malthouse Ultimatum, The Malthouse Identity, The Malthouse Supremacy, The Malthouse Legacy, then lastly The Malthouse Compromise. Shouldn\u2019t even place. If the circumstances were less deadly serious, British politics would resemble one of those terrible British comedies whose opening-weekend box office is \u00a3345, and later turns out to have been designed solely as a complex investment vehicle designed to liberate Gary Barlow from his tax obligations. Unsurprisingly, the Dutch foreign minister this week spoke of growing dismay in European capitals. You might remember the EU butter mountain and the EU wine lake; say hello to the EU dismay ocean. We\u2019re drowning in it. Maybe a passing ferry will save us? In Greek mythology, you paid the ferryman to cross the River Styx. Brexit mythology is more complex. There is no ferryman \u2013 indeed, there are no ferries \u2013 but Chris Grayling pays \u00a3800,000 to management consultants to get told this, and somehow doesn\u2019t go to hell. The transport secretary won\u2019t even be going to Calais, having been told he wasn\u2019t welcome at the port last week by its chairman. Or perhaps a warship will save us? On Monday, Gavin Williamson \u2013 who bagsied the role of Iceman in the year 9 Top Gun musical \u2013 threatened to send a warship to China. On Thursday, as a result, China pulled out of trade talks with the UK. So Williamson sees Grayling get a Calais asbo, and promptly gets trade talks with China cancelled. Game recognise game. And yet, the Tories continue to poll ahead of Labour. It\u2019s always encouraging to hear Corbyn boosters honk about how much they\u2019d expect him to put on in a campaign situation. The slightly incredulous response has to be: um, yes?! I should hope so?! I mean, you would hope that anyone might improve on losing to a party that is essentially a gif of someone lighting their own fart and then being consumed by the fireball. Against that sort of competition, you would expect to be able to run one of the more divisive Sesame Street Muppets \u2013 ie Elmo \u2013 and put on a few points. It\u2019s hardly a kitemark. As for how the rest of the week was spent, there\u2019s a point at which politicians\u2019 preoccupations cease to be curiosities and tip over into the realm of horrifying psychiatric diagnoses. Kurt Vonnegut wrote his satirical novel Cat\u2019s Cradle after becoming troubled by what he saw as the indifference of pure scientists contributing their theoretical work towards the development of practical horrors such as the atomic bomb. The title referred to the childish game he imagined one of these rarefied individuals playing right at the moment the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. If we crash out of the EU without a deal, I hope someone publishes a coffee-table book detailing each of the irrelevant arguments we had on each day as the Brexit doomsday clock ticked down. T-minus 42 days: was Churchill a shit or not? T-minus 41 days: where do you stand on the Boer war? There is something truly grotesque about all this playing out as children around the country and the world strike from school to protest against climate emergency. In Westminster, a generation who will never be forgiven don\u2019t even have the thing they won\u2019t be forgiven for on their radar. It is left, shamefully, to actual kids to point it out. With absolute ironicidal inevitability, then, May made the time to criticise the nation\u2019s young for their actions. Apparently, the climate strike \u201cwastes lesson time\u201d. Just to be clear, Prime Minister, on Thursday a party colleague requested an emergency parliamentary debate on Winston Churchill, who literally DIED IN 1965. Can you grown-ups give the kids another lecture on time-wasting, please? And if there\u2019s any time before Brexit left after that, how about a game of cat\u2019s cradle? \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Text messages between a Portland police bureau (PPB) officer and far-right leader Joey Gibson appear to show a warm and cooperative relationship and even exchanges of legal and tactical information. First reported by Willamette Week, which obtained them with a public records request, the texts show months of exchanges between Gibson, the leader of the Patriot Prayer group, which has staged sometimes violent rallies in the city for almost two years, and Lt Jeff Niiya, head of the PPB rapid response team, which patrols political rallies. Niiya offered congratulations on Gibson\u2019s plans run for Senate, expressed concern for the safety of his family, and wrote: \u201cI want you to know you can trust me. Don\u2019t want to burn that.\u201d Other messages appear to show the officer offering advice about police tactics. On 23 December 2017, Niiya texted to Gibson: \u201cHeads up just told 4-5 black Bloch [antifascists] heading your way. One carrying a flag. We will have officers nearby but you may want to think about moving soon if more come.\u201d Niiya also appears to advise Gibson about avoiding the arrest of group member Tusitala \u201cTiny\u201d Toese, who has allegedly been involved in acts of violence in the city. On 8 December 2017, discussing Toese\u2019s presence at a rally at a time when he was the subject of an outstanding warrant, Niiya wrote: \u201cJust make sure he doesn\u2019t do anything which may draw our attention. If he still has the warrant in the system (I don\u2019t run you guys so I don\u2019t personally know) the officers could arrest him. I don\u2019t see a need to arrest on the warrant unless there is a reason.\u201d Members of Portland city government reacted sharply. Newly elected commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty \u2013 the first African American woman elected to the council \u2013 said the news \u201csimply confirms what many in the community have already known \u2013 there are members of the Portland police force who work in collusion with rightwing extremists\u201d. Mayor Ted Wheeler, also the PPB commissioner, called the messages \u201cdisturbing\u201d and said: \u201cIncidents like this contribute to the distrust that so many community members have about the Portland police bureau.\u201d Hardesty called for an independent investigation; Wheeler said he had directed the PPB chief Danielle Outlaw to investigate. PPB announced an internal investigation and released the texts and related emails. Last week, the Portland city council passed a resolution denouncing the city\u2019s racist history, white supremacy in general and \u201cthose who propagate hate and incite fear and violence in our community\u201d. The motion was widely interpreted as referring to Patriot Prayer rallies. Gibson testified at the relevant meeting, reading from the Bible. PPB has regularly been accused of bias in favour of Patriot Prayer, and against leftwing counterprotesters. On 4 August 2018, PPB officers fired \u201cless than lethal\u201d rounds into a crowd of counterprotesters, injuring several, including a woman who said she was peacefully protesting and who has commenced legal action. No such police action was taken against 500 protesters on the rightwing side of the event. Patriot Prayer members have been involved in alleged acts of violence outside rallies, with apparent impunity. Community groups who helped the city council draft its resolution on white supremacy expressed disappointment with the Gibson texts. Eric Ward, the director of the anti-racist Western States Center, said: \u201cThis continued cycle of collusion with the \u2018alt-right\u2019 places the PPB directly at odds with the rule of law and values and priorities expressed by elected Portland city leadership.\u201d Other leftwing groups were similarly scathing. Olivia Katbi-Smith, the co-chair of Portland Democratic Socialists of America, said: \u201cThere is a reason for the saying \u2018cops and Klan go hand in hand\u2019. American police forces were founded to protect white supremacy and the ruling capitalist class that enforces it.\u201d PPB did not immediately respond to questions about the texts, other incidents and potential bias.",

      "bodyText": "A senior Belgian intelligence officer is under investigation over allegedly sharing secrets with the Russians, in a case that exposes fears about spying in the European Union and Nato. An unnamed major who is the head of division at the general intelligence and security service (GISS), the equivalent of M16, is accused of having exchanged confidential information with a Serbian woman believed to be a Russian agent. In another blow to the agency, it emerged that Clement Vandenborre, the head of counter-intelligence at GISS, was suspended from his post at the end of last month. He is alleged to have shredded confidential documents, according to the Flemish daily De Morgen, which broke the story on Vandenborre and the Russian spying allegations. A spokesperson for Belgium\u2019s defence ministry confirmed that an investigation was under way. \u201cIn order not to hinder this investigation, we will not comment on this subject,\u201d the spokesperson said. Die Welt reported earlier this week that, according to a confidential assessment prepared by the EU\u2019s foreign affairs service, about 250 Chinese and 200 Russian spies were working in the Belgian capital, which is also home to Nato headquarters. The latest allegations against the GISS will deepen long-standing concerns about infighting, low morale and rogue missions in the feuding organisations that make up Belgian intelligence. The Dutch-language public broadcaster VRT reported this week that two senior officers from Belgium\u2019s intelligence service had travelled to Damascus in 2016 to negotiate with the regime of Bashar al-Assad, without the knowledge of the then defence minister. The officers were believed to have gone to Syria in the hope of developing contacts and gaining information about Europeans in the country who had joined jihadi groups, although nothing was gained, according to media reports. The defence minister at the time, Steven Vandeput, has denied any knowledge of the operation. Some analysts believe the French intelligence may be involved, doubting Belgium would act alone. After the Brussels attacks in 2016, Belgium\u2019s warring intelligence services were urged by politicians to work together, but the latest reports suggest problems persist. Bart Eeckhout, a senior writer at De Morgen, said the GISS was adept at espionage, \u201cespecially from each other\u201d. In a comment article for the paper he described a service in the grip of permanent \u201coffice war\u201d, characterised by mistrust, lack of direction and low morale among officers who believe resources are inadequate. One source told the paper the service was in such disarray that it struggled to gather up-to-date information after the disputed elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a key country of interest for Belgium as the former colonial power. Neither Vandenborre nor the unnamed officer have commented on the allegations, although sources close to them have said the charges are baseless. The allegations will fuel concerns about spying before the European parliament elections in May, which are already seen as a target for hostile powers. The EU foreign service was even reported to have advised EU diplomats to avoid a popular Brussels steakhouse close to the European commission\u2019s Berlaymont headquarters, prompting flabbergasted denials from the restaurant that any useful spying could be done in the noisy dining room. The EU\u2019s deputy Brexit negotiator, Sabine Weyand, made front-page news in the UK last summer when it was reported that she had raised the alarm about M16 spying on the Brexit negotiations. It emerged later that she had been joking.",

      "body": "<p>Mary Oliver, who has died aged 83, was perhaps the most popular American poet of the past few decades. The winner of a Pulitzer prize in 1984, she was loved for good reasons. Her poems are simple and straightforward, crystalline, reflecting a deep love of nature, and connecting the spirit world with the physical world in subtle ways. She wrote with a natural, even naive, enthusiasm for life itself, as in her majestic When Death Comes (1991), in which she cries:</p> <blockquote> <em>When it\u2019s over, I want to say: all my life</em> <br> <em>I was a bride married to amazement.</em> <br> <em>I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms.</em> <br> </blockquote> <p>Born in Cleveland, Ohio, she was the daughter of Edward Oliver, a schoolteacher, and Helen (nee Vlasak), a secretary. Though she gave few interviews, in one of them Oliver alluded to childhood abuse, although she did not elaborate. It is clear that an unhappy childhood led her into the world of words, where she was glad to remain, a reader and writer with a superb affinity for the natural world, a poet with a strong transcendentalist streak \u2013 in the tradition of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau.</p> <p>Oliver briefly attended Ohio State University, in Columbus, and Vassar College, in Poughkeepsie, New York, but without taking a degree. As a young woman, she was devoted to the poetry of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/feb/22/edna-st-vincent-millay-poetry\" title=\"\">Edna St Vincent Millay</a> and went to visit her home in Austerlitz, New York, on an impulse of affection. There she spent some years helping the late poet\u2019s sister to organise her papers.</p> <p>In the late 50s, in Austerlitz, she met <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/molly-malone-cook-310749.html\" title=\"\">Molly Malone Cook</a>, a photographer; they were life partners until Cook\u2019s death in 2005. The two lived for many decades in Provincetown, on Cape Cod, where the beaches, ponds, fields and forests became the landscape of Oliver\u2019s major poetry. She settled there, writing about hermit crabs, hummingbirds, owls, dogfish, turtles, roses, trumpet vines \u2013 a wilderness of symbolic (as well as literal) flora and fauna. Like Emerson, she would cast her eye upon an object, allow it to deepen, even darken. As she writes in the wonderful Skunk Cabbage (1983): \u201cWhat blazes the trail is not necessarily pretty.\u201d</p> <p>Critics attacked her for being simplistic, and it is true that her poems are delimited, the universe scrubbed clean of technology, her landscapes shorn of planes and cars. Even the imperfections in nature are largely absent, although Oliver defended herself from this charge in The Ponds (1990): \u201cI want to believe that the imperfections are nothing / \u2013 that the light is everything.\u201d She wished to be \u201cwilling / to be dazzled\u201d by the objects in her life, floating a little \u201cabove this difficult world\u201d.

This is a death poem that becomes a life poem, as the poet sleeps \u201cas never before\u201d, hearing the \u201csmall kingdoms breathing\u201d around her. The insects and the birds \u201cdo their work in the darkness\u201d. Consider the ending:</p> <blockquote> <em>I rose and fell, as if in water, grappling</em> <br> <em>with a luminous doom.

But the defender then used social media to deny it was deliberate, and on Friday he gave an interview to Spanish newspaper Marca to again deny any wrongdoing and claim his comments referred to deliberately giving away a free-kick to prevent an Ajax equaliser. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very surprised about all this,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cI was referring to forcing the foul, a foul that was inevitable. Not to forcing the booking.\u201d <br></p> <p>Asked if he knew the foul was likely to lead to a yellow card and a ban, he added: \u201cYes, but I had no choice. \u201cIt was a very dangerous counterattack in the 88th minute, with an open match and the tie as well. That\u2019s why I said that I would lie if I said I did not know that I was carrying a penalty, just as I knew that I had no other choice than to make a mistake. And that\u2019s what I meant when I said that in football you have to make complicated decisions.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf I had wanted to force a penalty, I could have done it in the group stage, in the match against Roma because we were already classified as first of groups and the last game, against CSKA, was inconsequential. By the way, a match in which I did not play.\u201d</p> <p><strong>So that\u2019s that!</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c66e99ce4b03c0232351725\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-15T16:33:00.094Z\">4.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/feb/15/fa-cup-fifth-round-news-and-more-weekend-football-countdown-live#comment-125909353\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3864629\" title=\"View Cambridgeskip\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/3864629\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Cambridgeskip\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3864629\" title=\"View Cambridgeskip\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Cambridgeskip</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/125909353\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">15 February 2019 2:07pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>It may be an unpopular view but I think Man City have been great for the Fa Cup this season.

This season City have bucked the trend of the top clubs putting out reserve sides and barely scraping through. Instead they\u2019ve put out strong sides and gone all out to win, spanking opposition as they\u2019ve gone.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for your company and contributions \u2013 here\u2019s a reminder of today\u2019s biggest stories. \u201cAnything can happen\u201d in Newport, says Guardiola: Fresh injury problems for Manchester United: Barney Ronay on football\u2019s tangled \u201cSportswashing\u201d web: Have great weekends, all, and see you again soon! And here\u2019s our story on that last entry: Wilfried Zaha\u2019s appeal against an additional one-match ban and \u00a310,000 fine for sarcastically applauding the referee after a red card at Southampton, has been rejected by an independent regulatory commission. He misses Palace\u2019s FA Cup 5th round tie with Doncaster Rovers on Sunday. Did Sergio Ramos deliberately get booked against Ajax this week so he could use up his suspension before the quarter-finals? The man himself has no idea why anyone would suspect such skullduggery, and here\u2019s why, courtesy of the Press Association: Ramos was booked in the 89th minute of Madrid\u2019s victory in Amsterdam, just minutes after Marco Asensio\u2019s late goal saw Madrid complete a comeback from 1-0 down, and he will now miss the second leg at the Bernabeu. Speaking immediately after the match, Ramos was quoted as saying he \u201cwould be lying\u201d if he denied deliberately earning the booking, comments which could attract an extended ban from UEFA. But the defender then used social media to deny it was deliberate, and on Friday he gave an interview to Spanish newspaper Marca to again deny any wrongdoing and claim his comments referred to deliberately giving away a free-kick to prevent an Ajax equaliser. \u201cI\u2019m very surprised about all this,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cI was referring to forcing the foul, a foul that was inevitable. Not to forcing the booking.\u201d Asked if he knew the foul was likely to lead to a yellow card and a ban, he added: \u201cYes, but I had no choice. \u201cIt was a very dangerous counterattack in the 88th minute, with an open match and the tie as well. That\u2019s why I said that I would lie if I said I did not know that I was carrying a penalty, just as I knew that I had no other choice than to make a mistake. And that\u2019s what I meant when I said that in football you have to make complicated decisions. \u201cIf I had wanted to force a penalty, I could have done it in the group stage, in the match against Roma because we were already classified as first of groups and the last game, against CSKA, was inconsequential. By the way, a match in which I did not play.\u201d So that\u2019s that! There is some truth in that. Guardiola has taken the cups seriously, as the bashing of Burton showed. A transfer! In January! Derby have signed the free-agent defender Efe Ambrose, once of Celtic, until the end of the season and he had this to tell RamsTV. Sounds as if he\u2019s a Frank Lampard fan: I had other offers from abroad so when my agent called me and said Derby were interested and they had put an offer to us, with Lampard, I said there is no second choice. I\u2019ve known Lampard since he was at Chelsea as a player, and he has been my hero and someone I\u2019ve always enjoyed watching play football. He is a legend. For me to come and have the opportunity to play under him is a great honour and I didn\u2019t think twice to come.\u201d I know the ambition what Frank Lampard wants for this club so for me, that is a motivation. Every player wants to make a mark and I want to do the best I can do to give back to the club. All I can do to make sure we are in the top six, the play-offs, or the coaches have said, automatic promotion, which is the best to put into the spirit of the players. I want to prove myself and make sure to repay his trust in me and that is why I\u2019m here.\u201d UEFA have opened disciplinary proceedings for incidents that happened at Malmo v Chelsea last night. Chelsea are being investigated for throwing of objects &amp; field invasions by supporters, and Malmo for setting off of fireworks &amp; throwing of objects. It\u2019s not ideal for Chelsea, who are already being investigated for alleged racist chanting by fans late last year. Wilfried Zaha\u2019s appeal against the additional one-match ban, for sarcastically applauding the referee after being sent off at Southampton, was apparently heard this morning. The club are currently waiting to discover whether or not he will be available for Sunday\u2019s FA Cup tie at Doncaster. Meanwhile, Wayne Hennessey will contest his FA charge for allegedly making a Nazi salute during a meal with teammates in January. Millwall boss Neil Harris wants his side to continue their rich recent cup tradition when they face AFC Wimbledon. He\u2019s told the club website: Just because we\u2019ve had a final, semi-finals and quarter-finals in the last 15 years, you cannot take for granted what it means to get to the latter stages of this competition - or the euphoria and excitement that it brings. Some of them couldn\u2019t believe they had the opportunity two years ago \u2013 most players go through their career without an appearance at this late a stage in the competition. The group may never get the chance again, so the message is clear \u2013 and that, with the inner-felt desire in the dressing room, should be enough for me not to have to tell them a lot more before the game.\u201d More reading matter for you \u2013 Jamie Jackson with the latest on Manchester United\u2019s new injury problems: Here\u2019s an interesting take on my question below. People are compromised! Wolves travel to Bristol City on Sunday in one of the round\u2019s most interesting ties. Last season, when they met in the Championship, Nuno was a bit of a naughty boy and got himself sent to the stands, although his side won it at the death anyway. He promises to behave this time! That game was so emotional. Particularly it was so hard for me as I was sent off and went to the stands. Being there, you realise that you cannot help the team. All the emotions come and later what I felt was a big, big joy and a tremendous moment of happiness. It was so important for us that I could not contain myself. All of us are different. I just try to follow my instincts and sometimes I know that I make mistakes. At the same time, I admit them, I apologise when I have to and I try to avoid them in the future.\u201d We know it\u2019s going to be very tough. They are a good team with good momentum. We started against Liverpool and then we went to Shrewsbury. Those challenges were so, so difficult. Now we are in the fifth round and we know how tough it will be, we have played there before. The only way we\u2019ll go through is if we compete to the best of our standards on Sunday.\u201d You know it\u2019s the FA Cup when ... Gianfranco Zola is giving Chelsea\u2019s press conference instead of Maurizio Sarri. I\u2019ll deliver you the best of that when we have it! Here\u2019s a companion to Barney\u2019s sportswashing piece \u2013 along with Rob Davies, he\u2019s compiled an alternative guide to this round\u2019s Champions League ties: Interested: does this kind of thing actively bother you, as a football follower, or are you more inclined to block it all out and enjoy the show? Here\u2019s Paul Wilson, reporting from the press conference of Pep Guardiola, who is saying all the right things: A little bad news from Manchester United, which I\u2019m sure we will have more on later: Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard are both out with injury for \u201ctwo or three weeks\u201d, according to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. It\u2019s a real rollercoaster this season. Norwich have a few injuries going into their match at Bolton and the pressure is on them now. Who\u2019ll make it into the top two? Are you At A Game this weekend? Do email and tell me which one, and why, and what is going to make it special. Hello again. Yes, it was sunny and shiny and I had a box of pasta. Let\u2019s recommence with a bang \u2013 this big, important Barney Ronay read on the scourge of sportswashing: I\u2019m going to hand back to Nick Ames now, who is hopefully refreshed and revitalised after his stroll in the spring-like Kings Cross sunshine. He\u2019ll bring you all the afternoon news as it happens. Pep Guardiola has turned up for his press conference before the Newport game. I can confirm he\u2019s not dressed in Sesame Street-style getup like he was last week and has gone for a 1980s Hacienda-style Manchester City-branded polyester sports hoodie look instead. The bad news for Newport is that he says he\u2019s done his homework on them and is taking them very seriously. \u201cWe have been studying Newport. Some areas they are stronger than us, we have areas we are stronger than them. They were outstanding against Middlesbrough. My team is ready, it will be tricky,\u201d says Guardiola. He\u2019s not overly bothered about the pitch being a leveller either. I have seen vintage games here in the 70s and 80s and all the pitches were bad. Now, most of the pitches are perfect. Newport own their stadium and can play how they want. We saw what happened at Wigan last season, we will take Newport very seriously. We played at Tottenham when there had been two NFL games on it, we have to adapt. We will take it seriously if we don\u2019t we will find it very difficult.\u201d Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo takes Wolves to Bristol City in the FA Cup on Sunday. It\u2019s probably an understatement to say he\u2019ll be given a frosty reception in the boardroom and a piping hot one by City fans. The last time he was there he got sent off and then celebrated a 94th-minute Ryan Bennett winner wildly next to former City manager Alan Dicks, who is in his 80s now, getting a bit too close to Dicks in the opinion of Bristol City boss Lee Johnson: He didn\u2019t hold himself in the perfect light when he got sent off up in our board room. I\u2019m surprised that Alan Dicks didn\u2019t two-foot him when he was all over him celebrating. As for Nuno, he said he just can\u2019t control himself: The game was so emotional. It was particularly hard for me \u2013 I was sent off and being there [in the stand] you can not help the team and the emotions come and what I felt was a big moment of joy was so important that I could not contain myself. Judge for yourself here: Brighton looked safe as houses in the Premier League at Christmas but they haven\u2019t won in the league since 29 December and are now staring anxiously at the relegation zone below them. Chris Hughton hopes the FA Cup tie against Derby can provide a \u201cwelcome distraction\u201d from the Seagulls\u2019 woes. There will be a frustration and disappointment because in such a short period of time, the dynamics have changed a little bit. In general most people felt we were quite comfortable but we never, ever felt that way. Our level of performance has been good but we all know it\u2019s about picking points up. We\u2019re hoping it [the Cup] is a welcome distraction. For us, it has to be about making sure we get through this next round. If we start thinking beyond that then we won\u2019t get past a very good Derby side. But it is definitely a great opportunity for somebody. Hello readers. Having just returned from my lunch I can confirm that there is indeed some lovely sunsheeeeeiiiine in London right now. Enjoy it Nick! Now, back to the football, where we may see Ashley Cole, who has won more FA Cups than any player in history, in action for Derby at Brighton tomorrow. Do we appreciate him as much as we should do? That\u2019s the question being posed by Sean Cole (no relation, apparently) in this defence of the 38-year-old full-back who has. let\u2019s be honest, a bit of a chequered past off the pitch. While I nip out in to the sunsheeeeiiiiiine for a few minutes, Gregg Bakowski will keep you abreast of all the baking hot news ... Here is more from the Newport manager\u2019s press conference today, courtesy of the Press Association: \u201cIf we win this, whether it\u2019s extra time or penalties and I don\u2019t care how we do it, it will be the biggest shock in FA Cup history,\u201d Flynn said at his pre-match press conference. \u201cI say that with the biggest respect to other big giant-killings. My reasons for that are because of the sheer gulf in finances, the quality of the players Man City have, the level they are playing at, and that they have the best manager in the world right now. So for those reasons it will be the biggest shock the FA Cup has ever seen.\u201d \u201cOf course there is,\u201d Flynn replied when asked if a shock to end City\u2019s hopes of winning an unprecedented quadruple was possible. \u201cOtherwise I\u2019d just turn up, give them the game, say \u2018let\u2019s shake hands\u2019 and walk off. \u201cWho said we were going to draw with Tottenham last season or beat Leicester, Leeds and Middlesbrough? These players have a knack of rising to the occasion. \u201cWe won\u2019t just be sitting back, no chance. I would rather get thumped doing it properly than losing 1-0 with no ambition. I want to give the supporters something to cheer about and these players have to believe, which I know they do, that they can cause an upset.\u201d Do you give them a chance? Remember, they rattled a strong Spurs team last season too. Confirmation from Martin Dubravka, the Newcastle goalkeeper who has made a slip or two of late, that he is a human being just like all/most of us: My family and my girlfriend, she knows me a lot in this case because I am really professional, so if I have just made one bad pass, I am very critical of myself. I am trying to study from every game what I can do better. Of course, I have made some good saves and some games were not what they were supposed to be. I have made some mistakes, but I am also a human being, I am not a robot. Of course I have made some mistakes, but the important thing is how you will look up for the next game, how you react. I can\u2019t put my head down, the only thing I can do is to be focused about my job and stabilise my performances, and that\u2019s what I am trying to do.\u201d Highlights from Newport\u2019s last home game, for any City fans who fancy a bit of scouting: Can you, unlike me, remember what happened yesterday? Or the day before that? Or the day before that? Our quizmeister extraordinaire, Paul Campbell, has this week\u2019s fiendish teasers: We can look even further ahead, if you like, to next week\u2019s Champions League games. Liverpool face Bayern Munich and Andy Robertson, always generous with his time and words, can\u2019t wait for another Big European Night At Anfield. Will they respond to the crowd? I think that\u2019s what all good teams do. We had a good run last season and especially in the Champions League I think it helped massively. Everyone knows how special nights here are in the Champions League. We feed off each other. Players feed off the fans and the fans feed off the players because it\u2019s up to us to get them to have something to shout about. But it also helps when they\u2019re getting behind us and it can maybe give you that extra percentage or whatever in the game. That\u2019s what home fans are for. Every club\u2019s got it and it\u2019s all about making the most of it.\u201d Imagine they\u2019ll get a crowd in for that. Salford could easily be a Football League club next season. They\u2019re fifth in the National League \u2013 although that table is topped by Solihull Moors, who are coached by another England legend, Tim Flowers. This is interesting \u2013 Steven Gerrard wants artificial pitches, all the rage north of the border, banned from the Premiership: The players\u2019 strong views on this are very interesting too. I have to say, you don\u2019t meet many who like them. But you can see why clubs everywhere do: they ensure you can get a game on and, used astutely, can make you a lot of money in the meantime. What do you think? Big one for Palace \u2013 and for Donny. There are only seven top-flight teams left in the last 16, which is both an opportunity for the minnows and a lament about the fact so many mid-table managers would rather just laugh the Cup off. For your aural pleasure, don\u2019t forget to look ahead to the weekend with Max and the gang at Football Weekly Extra: It is true that Newport\u2019s pitch could be better. I\u2019m going to that game tomorrow so I hope it holds up. A few years ago I travelled there to cover a cup tie with Blackburn, only for it to be called off 45 minutes before kick-off because the surface was waterlogged. Purists might tut but, really, it shouldn\u2019t matter and really only adds to the spectacle. Not everything has to be pristine and Insta-perfect. Not even football pitches. Sometimes it\u2019s OK for things to be a little bit rubbish. \u201cA lot is being made about the Newport pitch being a great leveller,\u201d emails \u2018Will\u2019. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s utter cr@p but surely Manchester City are too good to fear such a thing. De Bruyne could control a rubber ball on a bouncy castle. What do you think?\u201d I think more football should be played on bouncy castles. \u201cChelsea believe in Sarri!\u201d ROARS David Luiz. We have had many meetings already asking if someone doesn\u2019t believe. They can say. Nobody said anything. It\u2019s because everyone believes [in it]. We lost against maybe the best team in the world at the moment in Manchester City. They were better than us from the beginning to the end. We lost a few matches because it is part of the process. The teams that are at the top of the table now are ones with managers who have been there for more than three years. There is a big difference when you have already understood everything, it is much easier to play football. I think we are in the right way to still improve to become a fantastic team.\u201d Jacob Steinberg has some hot transfer rumours for you \u2013 just promise to keep them to yourself: We\u2019ll have more from Newport later, but their manager Mike Flynn has just said it would be \u201cthe biggest shock in FA Cup history\u201d if they beat City tomorrow. Do you agree? Yesterday, Flamengo played their first match since the fire that tragically killed 10 academy players at their training ground. Here is an Associated Press report: \u201cBrazilian club Flamengo played its first match since the fire that killed 10 of its academy players at its training ground 8 Feb, losing 1-0 to rival Fluminense on Thursday night. Nearly 30,000 fans, many with white balloons, banners and flags, attended the state championship match. The game was initially scheduled for Saturday, only hours after the deadly incident. \u201cFlamengo supporters sang a song to honor the dead at 10 minutes of play. Luciano scored for Fluminense. Survivor Cauan Emanuel, who was released from hospital this week, was filmed crying in the tribunes of the Maracana, sided by family members and Flamengo fans. The victims were between 14 and 16 years old. Police are still investigating what caused the fire.\u201d Slightly damning from Petr Cech \u2013 he says Arsenal could have played for another couple of hours without scoring last night: Yesterday it was one of those games where if we played for another couple of hours probably we wouldn\u2019t have scored. But there are games in football like that. You try, you play, the goal does not arrive and you have to go home with the result you don\u2019t want but you have to pick yourself up and be ready for the second leg. This is the advantage of playing two-legged ties - when one game goes wrong you can always make up for it. We didn\u2019t take our chances. In the first-half in particular we played well and created enough chances to go ahead in the game but unfortunately we didn\u2019t take our chances and then we conceded in the last minute of the first half which obviously gave them a lot of confidence and belief. We wanted to score goals and win to put ourselves in a good position. We\u2019ve left it more tricky for ourselves and we need to win at home.\u201d Yes, should be lively in Shepherd\u2019s Bush tonight. And you really wouldn\u2019t rule out at least one of Watford and Wolves going all the way on present evidence, to be fair. Can you \u2013 or your team of choice \u2013 beat that for a post-victory recovery feed? I\u2019m not talking jagerbombs at 4am down Vodka Revs, but strictly food-based. No cryogenic chamber or isotonic drip-feed? I\u2019m appalled. Good news for Charlton fans: the League One club\u2019s faithful have succeeded in having The Valley re-listed as an \u201casset of community value\u201d, meaning their supporters\u2019 trust must be notified if it is put up for sale and have the right to make their own bid. Might not seem earth-shattering but, given the trials and tribulations there in recent years, all measures of stability at Charlton are very welcome. We can wallow \u2013 or lavish, depending on who you support \u2013 in some Europa League reaction too, if you like. What *on earth* was that from Arsenal in Belarus? And has Maurizio Sarri bought himself valuable time with Chelsea\u2019s win over Malmo? Maybe we should all be Sarri for doubting him! Stuart James has been in Newport with Padraig Amond, the striker who hopes to embarrass Pep Guardiola tomorrow. This is a cracking interview, and Amond\u2019s thought process when scoring in the last round against Middlesbrough is described particularly nicely: News from Spain: Barcelona\u2019s manager, Ernesto Valverde, has inked \u2013 which isn\u2019t a verb \u2013 a contract extension until 2020, with the option of additional year. Excited, cul\u00e9s? Here\u2019s a nice interview to kick things off with. It\u2019s Harry Wilson, the Derby youngster on loan from Liverpool, talking to our very own Ben Fisher: It is Friday \u2013 a very crisp and bright Friday, here at least. And there\u2019s lots to snap into today: FA Cup fifth round weekend is upon us and the matches we\u2019ll be looking ahead to are thus: Friday: QPR v Watford Saturday: Brighton v Derby; AFC Wimbledon v Millwall; Newport v Manchester City Sunday: Bristol City v Wolves; Doncaster v Crystal Palace; Swansea v Brentford Monday: Chelsea v Manchester United I swear that when we get to the semis they\u2019ll still find a way of dragging this all out over four days. Anyway, two or three genuinely belting ties there, so if you\u2019re a veteran of Rodney Parade or heading down to Kingsmeadow for the first time, I\u2019d like to hear from you. There\u2019s also Championship promotion race action, Norwich visiting Bolton tomorrow. And plenty going on in that there Europe, too. While we get our little heads round all that, send your emails and tweets in to the addresses above. What\u2019s rocking your weekend?",

If anyone, I blame the government for putting Skripal in Salisbury.\u201d</p> <p>The Skripals collapsed in Salisbury on 4 March last year after being poisoned with novichok at Sergei\u2019s home on the outskirts of the city. On 30 June, Dawn, 44, and her boyfriend, Charlie Rowley, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-44707052\">fell ill at his home in Amesbury</a> 11 miles north of Salisbury.</p> <p>At first, police believed they had taken contaminated drugs, but tests showed they had been poisoned with novichok. The Skripals and Rowley survived but <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44760875\">Dawn died on 8 July</a>. Rowley later revealed the novichok had been in a perfume bottle and that she had sprayed the oily liquid over her skin. He said he had found the bottle and<a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2018-07-24/charlie-rowley-novichok-amesbury/\"> given it to her as a gift</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2b65d85fb1f9b6d0f37751d94386a6b4e764ec4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2b65d85fb1f9b6d0f37751d94386a6b4e764ec4/0_0_2750_1650/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Forensic investigators wearing protective suits collect evidence after the poisoning of Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Forensic investigators wearing protective suits collect evidence after the poisoning of Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stan and Caroline, stalwarts of the village of Durrington in Wiltshire, are angry at how their daughter was initially portrayed.

I do believe it was sealed,\u201d said Caroline. Asked how they believed Rowley came by the novichok, Caroline said: \u201cI think he stumbled on it. I believe he had only just found it. If Charlie had found it in a bin in March he would have given it to Dawn straight away.\u201d</p> <p>The Sturgesses believe more novichok could be found in Wiltshire. \u201cThis could happen again,\u201d said Caroline. \u201cThere could be another package out there.\u201d</p> <p>Describing her daughter, Caroline said: \u201cShe was bubbly, intelligent, witty and very upbeat. She wanted everybody to be happy. She would help everyone. She was very strong and very brave.\u201d</p> <p>Stan speaks of Dawn as a gentle hippy, who had always loved visiting nearby Stonehenge. She had worked as a flower picker in Cornwall and in a pub. The Sturgesses accept Dawn had troubles. They said she had issues with alcohol but did not take drugs.</p> <p>Her parents believe Dawn was on the up at the time of her death. She was in a happy relationship with Rowley and was about to move into her own flat. \u201cDawn was really turning a corner,\u201d said Caroline.</p> <p>When Dawn collapsed, Rowley rang Caroline in a panic but she heard nothing more that day and believed Dawn must have been fine. Next day, the intensive care team at Salisbury district hospital called.</p> <p>Dawn\u2019s family had to wear gloves when they visited her as doctors and scientists worked to understand what had made her and Rowley ill. Dawn was unconscious and on life support. They were able to touch her but were told not to brush their own skin with their fingers after contact. \u201cAt one point I was stroking her hair and I started crying,\u201d said Caroline. \u201cI went to wipe a tear away. A consultant told me: \u2018Don\u2019t touch your face.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Three days after Dawn and Rowley collapsed, <a href=\"https://www.wiltshire.police.uk/article/2937/Statements-issued-at-multi-agency-press-conference-in-Amesbury-\">preliminary tests showed they may have been exposed to a nerve agent</a>.

She also subsequently suffered a bleed to the brain.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t get the image of her on the machines out of my head,\u201d said Caroline. \u201cI keep picturing myself stroking her hair thinking she was going to die.\u201d Her final words to Dawn were: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do what you\u2019ve got to do.\u201d Stan said he liked to think that, in effect, she died not in hospital but in Rowley\u2019s flat with the man she was in love with.</p> <p>Once the life support machines were switched off, the family were told Dawn\u2019s body might have to be incinerated at the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory\">government laboratory at Porton Down</a>. They were thankful that, in the end, they were able to organise a <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/amesbury-poisoning-very-emotional-funeral-held-for-novichok-victim-dawn-sturgess-11454543\">moving funeral</a> at the crematorium in Salisbury and saved a seat at the front for Rowley, who by now had been discharged from hospital.</p> <p>\u201cThat was definitely for Dawn, it\u2019s what she would have wanted,\u201d said Caroline. They do not blame Rowley for Dawn\u2019s death. Caroline said: \u201cDawn loved him. He adored her. Charlie was kind to her.\u201d A charity helped them cover the funeral costs. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have relied on charity to bury our daughter,\u201d said Caroline.</p> <p>It was difficult for the family to mourn properly.

      "bodyText": "The parents of the woman who died in the Wiltshire novichok poisonings have broken their silence to express their anger and hurt at losing their daughter in an extraordinary international incident and say they believe there could be more of the nerve agent yet to be found. Speaking as the first anniversary of the poisonings nears, Stan and Caroline Sturgess also revealed their concerns that the UK authorities chose to settle the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, exposing residents to risk. The couple told the Guardian they still had many unanswered questions and called for more clarity from the British government about the poisonings. They also spoke passionately about their sense of injustice that Dawn, a mother of three from a very respectable family, was unfairly portrayed as a homeless drug user. The Sturgesses have complicated feelings toward Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, who collapsed after being poisoned with novichok in Salisbury and are now in hiding. \u201cI don\u2019t know where Skripal is and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if I met him. He\u2019s still got his daughter,\u201d said Stan, a retired bricklayer. Caroline said: \u201cIt\u2019s sad they ended up in a coma but they weren\u2019t the true victims. He [Skripal] took risks \u2013 he must have known there was a chance people were still after him.\u201d The couple said they did not hate Russia, which has been accused by the British government of carrying out the attack. \u201cI can\u2019t take it personally,\u201d said Caroline, a retired civil servant. Stan added: \u201cIf they\u2019d targeted Dawn specifically, it would be different.\u201d He said of the Skripals\u2019 alleged attackers: \u201cI don\u2019t care if they are arrested or put in prison.\u201d But he continued: \u201cI want justice from our own government. What are they hiding? I don\u2019t think they have given us all the facts. If anyone, I blame the government for putting Skripal in Salisbury.\u201d The Skripals collapsed in Salisbury on 4 March last year after being poisoned with novichok at Sergei\u2019s home on the outskirts of the city. On 30 June, Dawn, 44, and her boyfriend, Charlie Rowley, fell ill at his home in Amesbury 11 miles north of Salisbury. At first, police believed they had taken contaminated drugs, but tests showed they had been poisoned with novichok. The Skripals and Rowley survived but Dawn died on 8 July. Rowley later revealed the novichok had been in a perfume bottle and that she had sprayed the oily liquid over her skin. He said he had found the bottle and given it to her as a gift. Stan and Caroline, stalwarts of the village of Durrington in Wiltshire, are angry at how their daughter was initially portrayed. They believe suggesting she and Rowley were troubled and irresponsible suited the narrative that they were harmed partly because of their lifestyle. Caroline said: \u201cThey were trying to get out the message that \u2018this couldn\u2019t happen to you, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s because of their lifestyle\u2019.\u201d They trust Rowley\u2019s memory of the perfume bottle being in a sealed box, even though this undermines the idea that the novichok Dawn came into contact with was the same as was used in the attack on Skripal more than three months before. \u201cI think Charlie would remember that. I do believe it was sealed,\u201d said Caroline. Asked how they believed Rowley came by the novichok, Caroline said: \u201cI think he stumbled on it. I believe he had only just found it. If Charlie had found it in a bin in March he would have given it to Dawn straight away.\u201d The Sturgesses believe more novichok could be found in Wiltshire. \u201cThis could happen again,\u201d said Caroline. \u201cThere could be another package out there.\u201d Describing her daughter, Caroline said: \u201cShe was bubbly, intelligent, witty and very upbeat. She wanted everybody to be happy. She would help everyone. She was very strong and very brave.\u201d Stan speaks of Dawn as a gentle hippy, who had always loved visiting nearby Stonehenge. She had worked as a flower picker in Cornwall and in a pub. The Sturgesses accept Dawn had troubles. They said she had issues with alcohol but did not take drugs. Her parents believe Dawn was on the up at the time of her death. She was in a happy relationship with Rowley and was about to move into her own flat. \u201cDawn was really turning a corner,\u201d said Caroline. When Dawn collapsed, Rowley rang Caroline in a panic but she heard nothing more that day and believed Dawn must have been fine. Next day, the intensive care team at Salisbury district hospital called. Dawn\u2019s family had to wear gloves when they visited her as doctors and scientists worked to understand what had made her and Rowley ill. Dawn was unconscious and on life support. They were able to touch her but were told not to brush their own skin with their fingers after contact. \u201cAt one point I was stroking her hair and I started crying,\u201d said Caroline. \u201cI went to wipe a tear away. A consultant told me: \u2018Don\u2019t touch your face.\u2019\u201d Three days after Dawn and Rowley collapsed, preliminary tests showed they may have been exposed to a nerve agent. A consultant broke the news to the family and police advised them to leave their home as the media would be arriving on their doorstep. The family gathered in a car park near Salisbury and fled to a hotel 40 miles away. They felt isolated, disorientated, unsupported and too far away from Dawn\u2019s hospital bed. \u201cIt was the most bizarre thing,\u201d said Caroline. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know where to go or what to do.\u201d They returned to Dawn\u2019s bedside. Doctors told them that when their daughter collapsed she had been starved of oxygen for 25 minutes. She also subsequently suffered a bleed to the brain. \u201cI can\u2019t get the image of her on the machines out of my head,\u201d said Caroline. \u201cI keep picturing myself stroking her hair thinking she was going to die.\u201d Her final words to Dawn were: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do what you\u2019ve got to do.\u201d Stan said he liked to think that, in effect, she died not in hospital but in Rowley\u2019s flat with the man she was in love with. Once the life support machines were switched off, the family were told Dawn\u2019s body might have to be incinerated at the government laboratory at Porton Down. They were thankful that, in the end, they were able to organise a moving funeral at the crematorium in Salisbury and saved a seat at the front for Rowley, who by now had been discharged from hospital. \u201cThat was definitely for Dawn, it\u2019s what she would have wanted,\u201d said Caroline. They do not blame Rowley for Dawn\u2019s death. Caroline said: \u201cDawn loved him. He adored her. Charlie was kind to her.\u201d A charity helped them cover the funeral costs. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have relied on charity to bury our daughter,\u201d said Caroline. It was difficult for the family to mourn properly. Stan said: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t really grieve, it was very scientific. The police, the scientists, the coroner were doing what they were doing. The country was in uproar.\u201d In an odd way, Dawn\u2019s parents were relieved when it became clear she had been poisoned with nerve agent rather than contaminated drugs or drink. \u201cThe press had given us such a crap time,\u201d said Stan. \u201cWhen we found out it was novichok we were relieved to have the confirmation that it wasn\u2019t her fault.\u201d Caroline took huge comfort from the fact that no recreational drugs were found in her daughter\u2019s bloodstream and no disease in her liver or other organs. \u201cWhen they said it was purely because of the novichok it was a huge relief. She was innocent. It wasn\u2019t her lifestyle that killed her.\u201d Dawn\u2019s parents also take comfort from the fact that children had not found the perfume bottle. \u201cWhat if schoolchildren had picked it up and sprayed each other? That would have been the worst,\u201d said Caroline. \u201cI feel thankful that Dawn took a bullet for many other people. I\u2019m sorry we lost our daughter. I\u2019m thankful it wasn\u2019t children.\u201d They are also very grateful to the hospital staff who cared for Dawn, and to the village of Durrington, which has offered unwavering support. The Sturgesses have Dawn\u2019s ashes at home in a shrine beside her favourite toy as a child \u2013 a unicorn \u2013 and a pencil sketch of her done by a relative. They like to think of Dawn looking down on them. \u201cShe told her sisters she was going to go out in a blaze of glory. She flippin\u2019 did.\u201d said Caroline.

Not that she has ever made one, but she loves to collect them on her journeys around the globe. Two of these finds appear at the outset of The Journey of Things, her new exhibition at the Hepworth Wakefield. For Odundo, teapots represent how ceramics are central to culture and community. From China to England, people gather around them to socialise.

They have an unusual form, they can be made using various techniques and materials and they are functional. But, above all, they are objects infused with centuries of tradition. These interests are the driving force behind the exhibition, which unites more than 50 of Odundo\u2019s works plus a large collection of ceramics, photographs, paintings, textiles and sculptures that have influenced her during her 40-year career. Although there are some important names attached to this show \u2013 Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore, Edgar Degas \u2013 it is the object itself that Odundo values.

      "body": "<p>Marriage between cousins leading to fatal genetic conditions remain a factor in a significant proportion of child deaths in Bradford, according to a safeguarding report.</p> <p>The report by the West Yorkshire city\u2019s child death overview panel found that consanguineous relationships led to deaths from genetic and congenital abnormalities.</p> <p>The report, published annually by Bradford children\u2019s safeguarding board, reviewed 69 child deaths. These included 29 that occurred in 2017-18, 33 in 2016-17, and seven that took place in previous years.</p> <p>More than two-thirds of these deaths, 67%, involved children under the age of one, most of whom died within 28 days.</p> <p>Children of south Asian heritage were overrepresented in the figures compared with the population of the Bradford district, according to the report, with 45 (65%) of the children being of south Asian background. Those of south Asian heritage comprise 37% of Bradford\u2019s under-18 population.</p> <p>Thirty of the 69 deaths (43%) were categorised as chromosomal, genetic and congenital anomalies, conditions that are more common in families with parents who are related.</p> <p>The report also found that Bradford had a higher proportion of deaths attributable to chromosomal, genetic and congenital anomalies than nationally (25%).</p> <p>The report\u2019s authors recommended \u201cgenetic counselling\u201d and ensuring families were made aware of the risks of consanguineous marriages, which could help reduce the number of children who die of genetic disorders at a young age.</p> <p>It added: \u201cSouth Asian children are overrepresented particularly in category 7 deaths (genetic conditions). Around one-third of all category 7 deaths in Bradford are autosomal recessive in nature, and this type of condition is twice as likely to occur if the couple are consanguineous than in the whole population; also, in some families where the rare genes which cause autosomal recessive conditions are common and cousin marriage has been practised for several generations the risk can be much higher.</p> <p>\u201cConsanguinity is common in south Asian families locally and 53% of all south Asian children who died due to category 7 as a whole are from families who have married their cousin.\u201d</p> <p>Other risk factors in child deaths included obesity and smoking.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Bradford council said: \u201cWe are working closely with the NHS and other key partners to make sure families and individuals at most risk are given genetic counselling so that they can make informed choices about having children in the future.</p> <p>\u201cFamilies at risk are supported in making choices by their GPs and if appropriate referral to Bradford\u2019s specialist genetics services which hold regular local clinics for families.</p> <p>\u201cFamilies from all communities can be affected by genetic disorders and we are continuing to develop a range of services to support everyone and are constantly working to improve the information available to people across the Bradford district.\u201d</p> <p>In May 2017 a report found that one in five child deaths in an east London borough occurred because the mother and father were related.</p> <p>Redbridge council found deaths of children from parents who were known consanguineous couples \u2013 meaning second cousins or more closely related \u2013 accounted for 19% of 124 cases reviewed in the borough between 2008 and 2016.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 18 February 2019 so that the subheading made explicit \u2013 as had the main heading \u2013 that study findings on south Asian cousin marriage related to specifically to Bradford. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Marriage between cousins leading to fatal genetic conditions remain a factor in a significant proportion of child deaths in Bradford, according to a safeguarding report. The report by the West Yorkshire city\u2019s child death overview panel found that consanguineous relationships led to deaths from genetic and congenital abnormalities. The report, published annually by Bradford children\u2019s safeguarding board, reviewed 69 child deaths. These included 29 that occurred in 2017-18, 33 in 2016-17, and seven that took place in previous years. More than two-thirds of these deaths, 67%, involved children under the age of one, most of whom died within 28 days. Children of south Asian heritage were overrepresented in the figures compared with the population of the Bradford district, according to the report, with 45 (65%) of the children being of south Asian background. Those of south Asian heritage comprise 37% of Bradford\u2019s under-18 population. Thirty of the 69 deaths (43%) were categorised as chromosomal, genetic and congenital anomalies, conditions that are more common in families with parents who are related. The report also found that Bradford had a higher proportion of deaths attributable to chromosomal, genetic and congenital anomalies than nationally (25%). The report\u2019s authors recommended \u201cgenetic counselling\u201d and ensuring families were made aware of the risks of consanguineous marriages, which could help reduce the number of children who die of genetic disorders at a young age. It added: \u201cSouth Asian children are overrepresented particularly in category 7 deaths (genetic conditions). Around one-third of all category 7 deaths in Bradford are autosomal recessive in nature, and this type of condition is twice as likely to occur if the couple are consanguineous than in the whole population; also, in some families where the rare genes which cause autosomal recessive conditions are common and cousin marriage has been practised for several generations the risk can be much higher. \u201cConsanguinity is common in south Asian families locally and 53% of all south Asian children who died due to category 7 as a whole are from families who have married their cousin.\u201d Other risk factors in child deaths included obesity and smoking. A spokesperson for Bradford council said: \u201cWe are working closely with the NHS and other key partners to make sure families and individuals at most risk are given genetic counselling so that they can make informed choices about having children in the future. \u201cFamilies at risk are supported in making choices by their GPs and if appropriate referral to Bradford\u2019s specialist genetics services which hold regular local clinics for families. \u201cFamilies from all communities can be affected by genetic disorders and we are continuing to develop a range of services to support everyone and are constantly working to improve the information available to people across the Bradford district.\u201d In May 2017 a report found that one in five child deaths in an east London borough occurred because the mother and father were related. Redbridge council found deaths of children from parents who were known consanguineous couples \u2013 meaning second cousins or more closely related \u2013 accounted for 19% of 124 cases reviewed in the borough between 2008 and 2016. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 February 2019 so that the subheading made explicit \u2013 as had the main heading \u2013 that study findings on south Asian cousin marriage related to specifically to Bradford.",

As testament to this, he devoted his life to a career in the CID, where he worked for 16 years, rising to the rank of detective superintendent.\u201d</p> <p>Stalker became the first head of GMP\u2019s drugs squad after holding posts in the force\u2019s bomb squad and serious crime unit.</p> <p>While a detective sergeant, Stalker investigated the Moors murderer, Ian Brady, who tortured and killed five children with his partner, Myra Hindley, between 1963 and 1965.

His death was announced by his eldest daughter, Colette Cartwright, in a statement paying tribute to a \u201cbeloved husband, grandfather and great-grandfather who enriched the lives of many\u201d. Cartwright said: \u201cAfter marrying my dear mum Stella in 1961, he spent his life as a devoted police officer, proudly serving the people of Greater Manchester for over 30 years. \u201cHe is fondly remembered by many as going above and beyond the call of duty and was committed to making a difference for those most in need. As testament to this, he devoted his life to a career in the CID, where he worked for 16 years, rising to the rank of detective superintendent.\u201d Stalker became the first head of GMP\u2019s drugs squad after holding posts in the force\u2019s bomb squad and serious crime unit. While a detective sergeant, Stalker investigated the Moors murderer, Ian Brady, who tortured and killed five children with his partner, Myra Hindley, between 1963 and 1965. He later said of the case: \u201cNothing in criminal behaviour before or since has penetrated my heart with quite the same paralysing intensity.\u201d Aged 38, Stalker became the youngest detective chief superintendent in the country when he was appointed head of Warwickshire CID in 1978. He was appointed deputy chief constable of GMP in 1984. It was Stalker\u2019s seniority in domestic policing that led to him leading an inquiry into the shootings of suspected members of the Provisional IRA by the Royal Ulster Constabulary in 1983. Stalker was removed from the inquiry in controversial circumstances after he discovered the existence of a secret tape containing potentially vital evidence of murder by RUC anti-terrorist officers in a shooting in county Armagh in October 1982. Stalker\u2019s report was highly classified and the circumstances of that shooting remain unclear. Cartwright said: \u201cDuring his time as a police officer, he travelled around the world studying terrorism and crime in Europe, the US and South America, and on his return he worked for two years in Northern Ireland. \u201cWhen he retired in 1987, he carved a new career as a journalist and pursued his passion for writing, subsequently publishing an autobiography in 1988, which touched on his longstanding and illustrious career. \u201cMy dad will be sorely missed by all lives he has touched both professionally and personally. We will always be proud of him and everything he achieved.\u201d",

The highest-profile nominees \u2013 Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, Christian Bale and Richard E Grant \u2013 may dominate the headlines, and, in the case of the first two, the Baftas, but all are outside chances at the Academy Awards, set to be pipped to the post by American actors. Yet in one corner of central London, awards season has, for some years now, been soundtracked by the constant noise of corks popping. Film4, the feature-film production arm of Channel 4, has, over the past few years, established itself as a pint-sized Oscars powerhouse. This year, it has a total of 13 Academy Award nominations, thanks to The Favourite, Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s Queen Anne romp starring Colman, Weisz and Emma Stone, and Cold War, Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski\u2019s follow-up to Ida. By comparison, moneybags outfits Netflix and Fox Searchlight each have 15 \u2013 which is the number Film4 managed in 2016, when its nominations were spread between Carol, Room, Amy, Ex Machina, Youth and 45 Years. Over the past decade, Film4 has taken 18 Oscars back to its HQ. Founded in 1982, and owned by its broadcaster parent, the company deals entirely with development and production, while most of its peers also handle distribution. Its knack for optioning unlikely books, then matching them to fruitful film-makers, is the stuff of legend. Few would have clocked the publication, in 2005, of Q&amp;A, an obscure first novel by an Indian diplomat; fewer still can have missed Slumdog Millionaire, Danny Boyle\u2019s film adaptation, which three years later won eight Oscars and took almost $400m. Film4 also prioritise spotting new talent then fostering it for as many films as possible: longtime collaborators include Boyle, Lanthimos, Martin McDonagh, Steve McQueen, Jonathan Glazer, Andrea Arnold, Lenny Abrahamson, Michael Winterbottom, Asif Kapadia and \u2013 for the past 35 years, at least \u2013 Mike Leigh. For many years, the company was run by Tessa Ross, but after she departed in 2014, a brief tenure by David Kosse saw the annual budget jump from \u00a315m to \u00a325m. Under current director Daniel Battsek, Film4\u2019s strategy is to invest more funds in fewer films, with the aim of being self-sufficient by next year. Battsek, 61, has found fans among Film4\u2019s talent stable, with Leigh praising his \u201clong experience and his charming enthusiasm\u201d and well as \u201cgreat style\u201d. Jonathan Glazer, whose Holocaust drama due in 2020 is already attracting awards talk, reports that working with the company on Sexy Beast and Under the Skin were \u201cgood experiences\u201d. Battsek is similarly understated, declaring himself both optimistic and pessimistic about The Favourite and Cold War\u2019s chances in Hollywood next Sunday, as well as disappointed that two other of their contenders \u2013 Leigh\u2019s Peterloo and Steve McQueen\u2019s Widows \u2013 weren\u2019t better liked by voters. \u201cI think Widows achieved everything it set out to creatively, but it didn\u2019t feature in the awards.

All three companies have a public service remit, although the terms are more explicit at the BFI; their \u201cdiversity criteria\u201d (introduced this year) mean only films that actively promote underrepresented groups can compete for certain Baftas. At Film4, Battsek reports that around 30% of its cash is ring-fenced for projects by first-time and diverse talent, but it is a historical favouring of more daring fare, such as 1985\u2019s My Beautiful Launderette, which has given them a credibility edge over the BBC, which has tended towards more populist heartwarmers, such as Billy Elliot. As industry expert Charles Gant points out, as fond as BBC Films is of a costume drama, it\u2019s unlikely it would have been comfortable with one as outre as The Favourite. Yet Battsek believes the key difference between the companies is one of capacity, with the Beeb\u2019s \u00a310m needing to stretch far wider than Film4\u2019s own annual budget (the BFI, by comparison, has \u00a380m to spend over five years).

The slate of films has been overhauled, with 40% of current projects new and focused on supporting the spikier end of British cinema. The first fruits of Garnett\u2019s tenure are now being seen, with three of her films premiering at Sundance last month, including The Souvenir, the latest drama from British social realist Joanna Hogg, which took the international jury prize. Hogg emails me on the way back from the film\u2019s rapturous reception in Berlin to say that Garnett\u2019s arrival at the BBC seemed to her \u201cnothing short of a miracle\u201d.

Four Lions (2010) (dir Chris Morris) With brilliant fearlessness, this satire from director Chris Morris, co-written by him with Sam Bain and Jesse Armstrong, tackles the issue of British jihadis, trying for martyrdom and glory. 10. The Selfish Giant (2013) (dir Clio Barnard) Oscar Wilde\u2019s children\u2019s story is passionately reinterpreted in this tough social-realist picture by Clio Barnard \u2013 not about a giant in his garden, but a dodgy dealer in his scrapyard, visited by two kids who have stolen some scrap metal.",

Trump, it has just been announced, is obese.</p> <p><strong>He is? </strong>He is. The results of his physical were quietly released on Thursday, and it has revealed that he weighs 243lb.</p> <p><strong>I don\u2019t know what that means. </strong>It means he weighs 110kg. It means he weighs more than 17 stone.</p> <p><strong>And that makes him obese? </strong>Just about. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/17/a-tall-tale-accuracy-of-trumps-medical-report-and-new-height-questioned\" title=\"\">Trump claims to be 6ft 3in tall</a>, and if that\u2019s the case, it means he has a BMI of 30.4. Officially, anything over 30 qualifies as obese.</p> <p><strong>Isn\u2019t BMI a flawed system?</strong> Of course it is. It\u2019s a crude calculation of weight divided by height squared, but it doesn\u2019t take into consideration what that weight consists of. For example, Daniel Craig\u2019s BMI technically makes him overweight, even though he is essentially just a very muscular clothes hanger.</p> <p><strong>So you\u2019re saying that </strong><strong>Trump might </strong><strong>be ripped beyond belief?</strong> He might. Who am I to know?</p> <p><strong>The same Donald Trump who binges on fast food and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/12/12/trump-reportedly-drinks-12-cans-of-diet-coke-each-day-is-that-healthy/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.f5cf259f1f40\" title=\"\">drinks up to a dozen Diet Cokes</a> a day? </strong>OK, fine, yes, I\u2019ve seen the golfing photos, too. Trump does often look like a sentient wad of cholesterol come to life to wreak havoc on the world.</p> <p><strong>So is </strong><strong>Trump the fattest president ever? </strong>Not even close. Grover Cleveland had a BMI of 34.6, and William Taft\u2019s BMI was 42.3. Taft was rumoured to have got stuck in the presidential bathtub.</p> <p><strong>Wow. </strong>But, hey, it\u2019s still early days. Trump loves fast food in all its forms \u2013 remember that giant mound of cold burgers he served during the shutdown? And don\u2019t forget that he is still going to be president for the next two years. He can catch up.</p> <p><strong>Oh God, don\u2019t say that. </strong>Fine then. The next six years.</p> <p><strong>Nevertheless, it\u2019s a shocking decline. </strong>Shocking? How so?</p> <p><strong>Didn\u2019t a doctor proclaim in 2015 that Trump was unequivocally \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\u201d? </strong>Ah yes, that was Harold Bornstein, who later claimed that Trump dictated those words to him.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m uncomfortable about the tone of this article. </strong>Because you think that gloating about someone else\u2019s appearance is unseemly?</p> <p><strong>Yes. </strong>Well, it is. But then again Trump called Alicia Machado, the winner of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/us/politics/alicia-machado-donald-trump.html\" title=\"\">1996 Miss Universe pageant, \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d because she had gained weight</a>, and you could fit about six of her into his frame.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>\u201cDonald Trump has a weight problem.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t say:</strong> \u201cMake America fit into its trousers again.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Name: Donald Trump\u2019s waistline. Age: 72. Appearance: Significant. Significant because it is attached to the world\u2019s most powerful man? No, significant because it\u2019s enormous. Trump, it has just been announced, is obese. He is? He is. The results of his physical were quietly released on Thursday, and it has revealed that he weighs 243lb. I don\u2019t know what that means. It means he weighs 110kg. It means he weighs more than 17 stone. And that makes him obese? Just about. Trump claims to be 6ft 3in tall, and if that\u2019s the case, it means he has a BMI of 30.4. Officially, anything over 30 qualifies as obese. Isn\u2019t BMI a flawed system? Of course it is. It\u2019s a crude calculation of weight divided by height squared, but it doesn\u2019t take into consideration what that weight consists of. For example, Daniel Craig\u2019s BMI technically makes him overweight, even though he is essentially just a very muscular clothes hanger. So you\u2019re saying that Trump might be ripped beyond belief? He might. Who am I to know? The same Donald Trump who binges on fast food and drinks up to a dozen Diet Cokes a day? OK, fine, yes, I\u2019ve seen the golfing photos, too. Trump does often look like a sentient wad of cholesterol come to life to wreak havoc on the world. So is Trump the fattest president ever? Not even close. Grover Cleveland had a BMI of 34.6, and William Taft\u2019s BMI was 42.3. Taft was rumoured to have got stuck in the presidential bathtub. Wow. But, hey, it\u2019s still early days. Trump loves fast food in all its forms \u2013 remember that giant mound of cold burgers he served during the shutdown? And don\u2019t forget that he is still going to be president for the next two years. He can catch up. Oh God, don\u2019t say that. Fine then. The next six years. Nevertheless, it\u2019s a shocking decline. Shocking? How so? Didn\u2019t a doctor proclaim in 2015 that Trump was unequivocally \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\u201d? Ah yes, that was Harold Bornstein, who later claimed that Trump dictated those words to him. I\u2019m uncomfortable about the tone of this article. Because you think that gloating about someone else\u2019s appearance is unseemly? Yes. Well, it is. But then again Trump called Alicia Machado, the winner of the 1996 Miss Universe pageant, \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d because she had gained weight, and you could fit about six of her into his frame. Do say: \u201cDonald Trump has a weight problem.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cMake America fit into its trousers again.\u201d",

Thunberg has described the rapid spread of school strikes for climate around the world as amazing. \u201cIt proves you are never too small to make a difference,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to wind up the blog now. Thanks for reading and for getting in touch to share your stories. Here\u2019s our most recent news story. The climate change strikers have found an unusual source of support: Conservative MPs who have issued comments applauding those who took time off school or college to join the protests. They include Claire Perry, the energy minister, who said: \u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud of young people who feel strongly that we need to take action.\u201d She was joined by the former higher education minister Sam Gyimah, who tweeted approvingly: \u201cBest to see this as an applied citizenship lesson on one day of the year.\u201d Meanwhile, Richard Benyon, the MP for Newbury, met a group of strikers at his office in the town. \u201cGreat to chat with young people so passionate about #climatechange. Glad to be able to talk of UK\u2019s world-leading achievements in reducing [greenhouse gas] emissions and commitments to ocean protection and end[ing] coal power generation,\u201d he later tweeted. Among the homemade signs on display in Newbury was one reading: \u201cI\u2019ll focus on my A-levels when you focus on the sea levels.\u201d But the official position from the Department for Education was unchanged. \u201cI want young people to be engaged in key issues affecting them and involving themselves in causes they care about. But let me be clear \u2013 missing class won\u2019t do a thing to help the environment. All they will do is create extra work for teachers,\u201d said Damian Hinds, the education secretary. \u201cThis is ultimately a matter for headteachers to consider, but I\u2019ve repeatedly said I don\u2019t want teachers being burdened with extra and unnecessary workload, and that\u2019s exactly what these strikes would lead to.\u201d Only a small proportion of the UK\u2019s 8 million school pupils are likely to have taken part in today\u2019s action, although some schools allowed pupils to join in the protests if accompanied by parents or given written permission. While the Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, a former teacher, joined a protest in Oxford, the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, was more nuanced in her support: \u201cI\u2019m inspired by the many young people who want to support the #schoolstrike4climate movement, but I hope it can evolve so we can build on its success without the loss of time in the classroom.\u201d School students who spoke to the New Scientist during the protests in London said the media had to share some of the blame for the global failure to tackle climate change. Eddy Barrow, 15, of Elmgreen school in Tulse Hill, south London, told the magazine: \u201cClimate change is a big problem that is being ignored by mainstream media. The MPs in parliament are not doing much. There will be rising sea levels, no more Antarctica, the climate will be destroyed. Loads of terrible things.\u201d The youngest protester to whom the New Scientist spoke was an eight-year-old boy with his mother. He was carrying a banner stating: \u201cBe cool, be green, not a dinosaur.\u201d When he was asked what he thought the world would be like when he was older, he replied: \u201cBurning.\u201d Also in Oxford, Windmill primary school has embraced today\u2019s climate strikes by holding a \u201cday of learning\u201d about global warming. A video of Greta Thunberg speaking at last year\u2019s UN climate change conference has proved popular with pupils, who are understandably concerned about the impact of climate change on their lives. Pupils made banners with slogans including \u201cSave the planet\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s no planet B\u201d, and are holding a picket line outside the school gates during the day, volubly encouraging parents \u2013 and passersby \u2013 to do more to tackle global warming. Forty Windmill pupils also travelled into Oxford to take part in this morning\u2019s protests. But rather than bunking off, these primary schoolchildren were supervised by their headteacher, Lynn Knapp, and a group of parents. At least 1,000 mainly young people held a protest in Oxford and heard from the local MP Layla Moran and the Guardian columnist George Monbiot. Knapp said it was important to raise pupils\u2019 awareness of climate change and valuable for children to learn they can achieve change by making a stand about issues that matter to them. Oxford was among other cities that had large turnouts today. Thousands gathered in Bonn Square, the Oxford Mail reports. Among them were students from Lord Williams\u2019s school in Thame, who wrote an open letter to their MP, John Howell, stating: \u201cRather than leaving our generation in a better place, the UK government has demonstrated an utter lack of impetus, energy or enthusiasm in tackling the greatest threat to our planet\u2019s future. \u201cThis shortsightedness cannot continue. We urge you to consider and act upon this letter.\u201d What about the newly planted lawn in Parliament Square? Christopher Hope, the Telegraph\u2019s chief political correspondent, has been voicing his concern. Some schools were more explicit than others when it came to supporting today\u2019s strikes. In Sheffield, however, the city\u2019s mayor has been promising to help strikers who get into trouble for not being in class. Meanwhile, the Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, was hosted at a school in Brighton. In Manchester, Poppy Noor reports that lots of students are saying they have been threatened with everything from unauthorised absences to suspensions today, but they think their futures are worth the risk. Among others she spoke to, there has been criticism of the government. The UN has yet to put out an official announcement about Anderson, but Solheim has already tweeted. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has picked the Danish economist and environmentalist Inger Andersen to be the new UN environment chief, turning the page on a scandal over expenses that rocked the UN agency. That is according to a letter seen by Agence France-Presse. Andersen, who heads the International Union for Conservation of Nature, is to succeed Erik Solheim of Norway, who resigned in November following an outcry over his travel expenses. A draft internal UN audit leaked to the Guardian in September found Solheim had spent almost $500,000 (\u00a3390,000) on air travel and hotels in 22 months, and was away 80% of the time. The audit said this was a \u201creputation risk\u201d for an organisation dedicated to fighting climate change. The UN deputy secretary general, Amina Mohammed, told a meeting of ambassadors on Thursday that Guterres had chosen Andersen as his nominee. Her nomination as head of the Nairobi-based UN Environment Programme will be submitted to the general assembly for approval. Andersen has also served as the World Bank vice-president for the Middle East and North Africa and worked at the UN for 15 years on water and environment issues. If confirmed as expected, Andersen will take the helm of Unep following Solheim\u2019s scandal-hit tenure. University students have also been out today, including at Lancaster University. In Belfast, a passionate crowd of schoolchildren have demonstrated in the centre of the city. The small but vocal gathering of primary and secondary pupils made their voices heard as they held up homemade signs and chanted outside city hall. The environmental protest was one of a series of coordinated events around the UK as young people left their classrooms to make a point on global warming. Maia Willis-Reddick, a 17-year-old student at Belfast\u2019s Methodist college, said time for action was running out. \u201cWe are protesting against the government for their ignorance of the problem of climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have 12 years before this becomes an international disaster, and before those 12 years, we need drastic action to take place in order to reduce carbon emissions for the entirety of the UK, the entirety of the world.\u201d Megan Hoyt, from north Belfast, accompanied her four children \u2013 Finn, Penny, Aisling and Isabelle \u2013 to the protest. \u201cWe are here today because we think it\u2019s time for political action,\u201d she said. The former higher education minister Sam Gyimah has joined the surprising number of Conservative MPs who have offered tacit support for pupils joining the strike. When another Twitter user told Gyimah \u201cNone of those kids will grow up to vote Conservative,\u201d he replied: \u201cThat\u2019s not the point. I thought you do things because they are the right thing to do. And then you try to take people along with you. But what would I know.\u201d The shadow education secretary has a nuanced take \u2013 she supports the strike but hopes it can \u201cevolve\u201d to avoid disruption. Another Labour frontbencher, Rebecca Long-Bailey, tweeted a video. Amy Walker has been talking to more of the students taking part in the strikes in Brighton. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, welcomed the strike earlier today as \u201ca cause for optimism in an often dark world\u201d. She tweeted that the Scottish government was a world leader \u201cbut, given the urgency, it is right that we are all challenged to do more and that we hear the voice of the next generation\u201d. A wave of strikes are taking place today across Scotland, including in the Highland towns of Fort William and Ullapool, as well as Glasgow and Edinburgh. The Scottish Green party education spokesman, Ross Greer, has written an open letter to education chiefs in Scotland urging them to confirm young people taking part in the strikes will not be punished for protesting. In the Highlands, the local authority has said the hour\u2019s strike will be recorded as an unauthorised absence, but will incur no punishment. As well as protesting outside schools, young people have also gathered outside the Holyrood parliament in Edinburgh and outside the City Chambers in Glasgow. It sounds like things are getting a bit more tense in London. My colleague Sandra Laville says mounted police have now moved right up to the young people sitting in the road and are shouting at them to move. Some of the young people are going \u2013 others are staying put for now. Footage of the strikes around the UK ... My colleague Sandra Laville says protesters are gathering at the bottom of Whitehall in central London, occupying the road and stopping traffic in all directions. The police presence has grown and mounted officers have cleared part of upper Whitehall. But the children have regrouped and are now blocking the road outside Westminster. The police are hanging back \u2013 for the time being \u2013 with legal observers watching proceedings. Although it is difficult to get a firm idea of numbers when an event is taking place across as many towns and cities as this, organisers are now confident that more than 10,000 young people are taking part in the climate strike. That is pretty remarkable, according to Jake Woodier of the UK Youth Climate Coalition, which is helping to coordinate the action, who said it would have been happy with a few hundred a couple of weeks ago. What we\u2019ve witnessed today is thousands upon thousands of students and young people descend on their towns and cities to demonstrate the urgent need for radical climate action. The size of the Youth Strike 4 Climate is testament to the passion and awareness among young people that we need to fight for a future that simply doesn\u2019t exist because we\u2019ve been betrayed by the inaction of those in positions of power. Unlike the political support we heard about from Jeremy Corbyn, Caroline Lucas and others earlier, Downing street has issued a rather disapproving statement. A No 10 spokesman said while it was important for young people to engage with issues such as climate change, the disruption to planned lesson time was damaging for pupils. Everybody wants young people to be engaged in the issues that affect them most, so that we can build a brighter future for all of us.. But it is important to emphasise that disruption increases teachers\u2019 workloads and wastes lesson time that teachers have carefully prepared for. That time is crucial for young people, precisely so that they can develop into the top scientists, engineers and advocates we need to help tackle this problem. In London, a breakaway group has moved away to march up Whitehall, stopping traffic in the road. They stopped outside Downing Street with a few police officers watching. Standing on the walls near No 10, they chanted for change. Several people in cars have been honking support in response to calls from the strikers, who briefly brought the streets around parliament to a standstill. From Downing Street, hundreds then turned to move back to Parliament Square. During the impromptu breakaway march, one boy climbed traffic lights outside Downing Street. Several cars and vans were stranded in the road as the children took over the street. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, has issued a statement in support of the strikers. Young people know that their lives are going to be changed dramatically by the impacts of climate change. The risks that older people hope they might dodge are the problems the young will inherit. And the longer the young wait for action to be taken, the harder it will be for them in future. While we\u2019re failing to deliver the changes young people need, we can hardly blame them for taking action themselves. Education has today been flipped on its head. The young are teaching the old, and we should pay attention. Amy Walker, reporting from Brighton for the Guardian, has been talking to Conrad, 16, a head boy who said he was there to represent other senior pupils at his school in Lewes because they were not given an authorised absence. \u201cThere\u2019s too much focus on Brexit these days in politics, but actually, this could kill everyone,\u201d Conrad said. There is substantial political backing for the strike. Here are some tweets from Labour and the Green party. The BBC\u2019s Today programme also had an interesting interview this morning with Claire Perry, the energy minister. Here are Perry\u2019s comments from Twitter: Marchers in Manchester have been addressed by nine-year-old Lillia Adetoro, who has been filmed delivering her speech: By midday in Parliament Square in London, there were more than 1,000 young people gathered. Holding their homemade banners, they chanted: \u201cWhat do we want? Action! When do we want it? Now!\u201d More people continued to join them, piling out of Westminster underground station to march to the square. In the crowd was the former Labour leader Ed Miliband with his nine-year-old son, Daniel. Daniel said: \u201cI\u2019m here because it\u2019s our future and we need to protect it.\u201d Miliband said: \u201cI think it\u2019s inspirational to see these young people today \u2013 the older generation has failed them and now needs to step up. What more important thing could there be than safeguarding the planet?\u201d Hundreds have gathered at Manchester Central Library today as part of the nationwide climate strike. The atmosphere was jovial as the students marched to the library from the Royal Northern College of Music with signs reading \u201cclimate over capitalism\u201d and chanting \u201cWhose future? Our future.\u201d Lorry drivers beeped and waved as the marchers held up traffic before coalescing in the square outside the library. Some students had travelled three hours from Cumbria to attend. Matt Sourby, 18, from Queen Elizabeth school in Kirkby Lonsdale, said it was worth the journey: \u201cThis is our future and this is making a difference. The government has to listen. I feel incredibly powerful just being here.\u201d An acoustic band played Counting Crows and were greeted with cheers for the lyrics: \u201cDon\u2019t it always seem to go, that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got till it\u2019s gone.\u201d Lillia Adetoro, nine, will be making a speech at 12.45pm. Holding a banner saying \u201cthere is no planet B\u201d, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to come here today because us children don\u2019t have the right to vote, so we have to strike to have our voices heard. \u201cWhen it\u2019s my generation and I\u2019m an adult, I\u2019m gonna be in the middle of this. I\u2019m feeling upset and nervous about the future. But I\u2019m hopeful that people are opening their eyes to what\u2019s happening. I think other nine-year-olds feel the same.\u201d Today\u2019s strike is part of a movement that started in August when the 16-year-old schoolgirl Greta Thunberg held a solo protest outside Sweden\u2019s parliament. Now, up to 70,000 schoolchildren each week are taking part in 270 towns and cities worldwide. Here\u2019s a piece from the Guardian\u2019s Jonathan Watts on how Thunberg\u2019s lone protest last summer has morphed into a powerful global movement challenging politicians to act: Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live blog of the first nationwide climate strike by schoolchildren and young people in Britain. We will be bringing you coverage of the strike in more than 60 towns and cities across the UK. Reports suggested thousands of children have walked out of lessons in protest at the mounting ecological crisis today, with organisers saying 3,000 had gathered in London, 2,000 in Oxford, 1,000 in Leeds and Exeter, and 600 in Brighton. Jake Woodier of the UK Youth Climate Coalition, which is helping coordinate the strike, said: What we\u2019ve witnessed today is thousands upon thousands of students and young people descend on their towns and cities to demonstrate the urgent need for radical climate action. The size of the Youth Strike 4 Climate is testament to the passion and awareness among young people that we need to fight for a future that simply doesn\u2019t exist because we\u2019ve been betrayed by the inaction of those in positions of power.",

This is clearly influenced by the cinema, so it seems apt that Peter Strickland\u2019s acclaimed 2012 movie about a sound technician has been reimagined for the stage by Joel Horwood as writer and Tom Scutt as director. Without having seen the film, I found the play both visually witty and morally disturbing. The central figure, Gilderoy, is a dork from Dorking who, on the strength of his nature films about the mysteries of the Surrey countryside, is hired by a sleazy Italian company to work as sound designer and Foley artist on one of the sex-drenched 1970s horror movies known as \u201cgiallo\u201d. Gilderoy\u2019s special brief is to provide an evocative soundscape for the film\u2019s sadistic climax in which the heroine is brutally tortured. What is fascinating is seeing how the professional challenge overcomes Gilderoy\u2019s instinctive revulsion. He fails to support a protesting female actor and, asked at one point if he believes in God, Gilderoy evasively replies: \u201cI\u2019m a technician.\u201d While the play attacks the idea that craft skills give you an ethical bypass, it delights in the process of creating sound: vegetables play a huge part, and we see celery sticks crunched, carrots chopped and marrows eviscerated to evoke atmospheric horror. Ben and Max Ringham as the play\u2019s sound designers, Tom Espiner as the on-stage Foley artist and Scutt as director palpably relish meeting the script\u2019s aural demands. But the moral dimension is never absent. Tom Brooke as Gilderoy brilliantly suggests not just an innocent abroad but a man corrupted by the task he has undertaken. The rapt look on Brooke\u2019s face as he finally matches the sound to the sadistic image speaks volumes. Lara Rossi as the mutinous actor strongly questions the dubious practice of over-dubbing another performer\u2019s voice. Luke Pasqualino as the director, reacting with fastidious disdain when his flick is called a horror movie, also suavely embodies the professional hypocrisy and male power structure that is the play\u2019s unerring target. \u2022 At Donmar Warehouse, London, until 30 March.",

The company is investing millions of pounds on label printers for every outlet and training thousands of workers as it revamps its systems amid a government consultation on tougher allergen labelling. There has been widespread concern about allergen labelling since 15-year-old Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died in July 2016 after eating a Pret a Manger baguette containing sesame seeds, to which she was severely allergic.

The non-profit he backs, OpenAI, has developed an AI system so good it had me quaking in my trainers when it was fed an article of mine and wrote an extension of it that was a perfect act of journalistic ventriloquism. As my colleague Alex Hern wrote yesterday: \u201cThe system [GPT2] is pushing the boundaries of what was thought possible, both in terms of the quality of the output, and the wide variety of potential uses.\u201d GPT2 is so efficient that the full research is not being released publicly yet because of the risk of misuse. And that\u2019s the thing \u2013 this AI has the potential to absolutely devastate. It could exacerbate the already massive problem of fake news and extend the sort of abuse and bigotry that bots have already become capable of doling out on social media (see Microsoft\u2019s AI chatbot, Tay, which pretty quickly started tweeting about Hitler). It will quash the essay-writing market, given it could just knock \u2018em out, without an Oxbridge graduate in a studio flat somewhere charging \u00a3500.

      "bodyText": "AFC Wimbledon v Millwall Both sides knocked out formidable Premier League teams to get here so the feelgood factor is likely to be high in both dressing rooms. AFC Wimbledon have never been this far in the FA Cupand they won their first league match of the year on Tuesday. They are likely to field a similar lineup but Millwall\u2019s Tom Elliott is a doubt to face his former club because of illness. Graham Searles Saturday 3pm Venue Kingsmeadow Head to head AFC Wimbledon 0, Millwall 2, Draws 2 Referee Jonathan Moss AFC WIMBLEDON Subs from McDonell, Thomas, Wagstaff, Pinnock, Garratt, Barcham, Soares Doubtful None Injured None Suspended None Discipline Y42 R3 MILLWALL Subs from Martin, Meredith, Ferguson, Pearce, Tunnicliffe, Morison, Karacan, Skalak, Brown, Leonard, Donovan Doubtful Elliot (ill) Injured Amos (finger, unknown), Bradshaw (knee, unknown) Suspended None Unavailable Onyedinma, Marshall, Thompson (all cup-tied) Discipline Y50 R1 Brighton v Derby Derby are looking to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals for the first time since 1999 and have a good chance of causing an upset, with Brighton battling to stay in the Premier League. Derby are unbeaten in their last six in all competitions. Brighton are unbeaten in their last five meetings with Derby having won two and drawn three. Graham Searles Saturday 12.30pm BT Sport 2 Venue Amex Stadium Head to head Brighton 15, Derby 20, Draws 7 Referee David Coote BRIGHTON Subs from Steele, S\u00e1nchez, Button, White, Kayal, Knockaert, Balogun, Bruno, Mlakar, Bernardo, Burn, Jahanbakhsh, Stephens, Izquierdo Doubtful Izquierdo (knee), March (ankle) Injured None Suspended Andone (first of three) Discipline Y45 R3 DERBY Subs from Ravas, Wisdom, Jozefzoon, Marriott, Johnson, Evans, Bennett, Bird, Cole, Nugent, Anya, MacDonald, Sibley Doubtful None Injured Mount (hamstring, Mar), Olsson (knee, Mar), Davies (achilles), Forsyth (knee, both unknown) Suspended None Unavailable King (cup-tied) Discipline Y72 R2 Bristol City v Wolves Bristol City are on fire. They have won nine in succession in all competitions and last lost in November. The best run in Europe. Their form has inspired the squad with the midfielder Josh Brownhill believing City can earn promotion and win the FA Cup. Wolves will certainly have to improve on their displays against Shrewsbury to knock out the Championship side, who could be missing Andreas Weimann. The Austrian, who has scored five goals in his last five matches, is having treatment for back spasms. Graham Searles Sunday 1pm BT Sport 2 Venue Ashton Gate Head to head Bristol City 15, Wolves 34, Draws 16 Referee Martin Atkinson BRISTOL CITY Subs from O\u2019Leary, Pisano, Baker, Taylor, Walsh, Watkins, Adelakun, Kelly, Semenyo, Eliasson, Hunt, Eisa, Palmer Doubtful Weimann (back) Injured M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 (calf, Mar), Smith (knee, Mar) Suspended None Discipline Y43 R1 WOLVES Subs from Norris, Cavaleiro, Giles, Ashley-Seal, Watt, Gon\u00e7alves, Traor\u00e9, Gibbs-White, Vinagre, Costa, Mason, Wilson, Sa\u00efss Doubtful None Injured None Suspended None Discipline Y48 R1 Chelsea v Manchester United Chelsea\u2019s players touched down back in England at around 4am after their Europa League win in Malm\u00f6, but were granted Friday off before preparations begin in earnest for this mouth-watering tie. Manchester United\u2019s visit to Stamford Bridge kickstarts a potentially season-defining 10-day period. \u201cWe know it\u2019s a crucial moment,\u201d said the assistant first-team coach, Gianfranco Zola, \u201cand very challenging.\u201d Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r took his coaching badges with the Italian, and will bring a United team to London still smarting from that midweek reverse to Paris Saint-Germain. Neither side should want for motivation. Dominic Fifield Monday 7.30pm BBC One Venue Stamford Bridge Head to head Chelsea 53, Manchester Utd 74, Draws 54 Referee Kevin Friend CHELSEA Subs from Caballero, Green, Ampadu, Palmieri, Cahill, Loftus-Cheek, Pedro, Christensen, Zappacosta, Kovacic, Drinkwater, Giroud, Hudson-Odoi Doubtful Drinkwater (achilles), Loftus-Cheek (back) Injured None Suspended None Discipline Y47 R0 MANCHESTER UNITED Subs from Grant, McTominay, Mata, Bailly, Fred, Romero, Dalot, Lindel\u00f6f, Gomes, Chong, Rojo Doubtful None Injured Lingard (hamstring, Mar), Martial (groin, Mar), Valencia (knock, unknown) Suspended None Discipline Y72 R5 Doncaster v Crystal Palace Doncaster are in the fifth round for the first time in 63 years and Roy Hodgson\u2019s Premier League defence will need to particularly mindful of the threat posed by the centre-forward John Marquis. The former Millwall striker has already scored 22 goals as Doncaster have surged into a League One play-off position and is noted for his elusive movement and incisive finishing Marquis also has several Crystal-Palace supporting friends travelling to the Keepmoat Stadium but will refrain from waving to them in the away end. Louise Taylor Sunday 4pm BBC One Venue Keepmoat Stadium Head to head Doncaster 5, Crystal Palace 8, Draws 3 Referee Mike Dean DONCASTER Subs from Jones, Butler, Rowe, Blair, May, Sadlier, Mason Doubtful None Injured None Suspended None Unavailable McLean (cup-tied), Smith (cup-tied) Discipline Y75 R2 CRYSTAL PALACE Subs from Guaita, Perri, Wan-Bissaka, Sakho, Tomkins, McArthur, Milivojevic, Riedewald, Wickham, Batshuayi Doubtful Benteke (knee), Kouyat\u00e9 (ankle), Tomkins (calf), Wickham (match fitness) Injured Souar\u00e9 (shoulder, Apr) Suspended Zaha (one match) Unavailable Sako (cup-tied) Discipline Y46 R2 Newport County v Manchester City \u201cIf we win this, whether it\u2019s extra time and penalties, it will be the biggest shock in FA Cup history.\u201d That is how Michael Flynn, Newport\u2019s manager, sees this magical tie and it is hard to argue with him. Manchester City are 83 places above Newport on the league ladder and a million miles apart in so many other respects. Pep Guardiola is taking nothing for granted and has highlighted how Newport\u2019s players are \u201ctaller and stronger than us\u201d. They couldn\u2019t, could they? Stuart James Saturday 5.30pm BT Sport 2 Venue Rodney Parade Head to head n/a Referee Andre Marriner NEWPORT COUNTY Subs from Townsend, Pipe, Dolan, Marsh-Brown, Sheehan, Azeez, Hornby-Forbes, Kennedy, Franks Doubtful None Injured Crofts (calf, Mar) Suspended None Discipline Y39 R3 MANCHESTER CITY Subs from Muric, G\u00fcndogan, Foden, Ag\u00fcero, Mahrez, Delph, Danilo, Sterling, Stones Doubtful None Injured Bravo (achilles, unknown), Kompany (knock, unknown), Mendy (knee, unknown) Suspended None Discipline Y47 R1 Swansea v Brentford An all-Championship tie featuring teams who were scheduled to meet at the Liberty Stadium in the league this weekend. Brentford have lost only one of their last 12 games and look increasingly comfortable under Thomas Frank. Swansea hope to have Oli McBurnie, their leading scorer, back in their starting lineup after the striker was only fit enough to come off the bench against Leeds on Wednesday. The Welsh club are looking to reach the quarter-finals in successive seasons for the first time since 1926-27. Stuart James Sunday 4pm BBC One Wales Venue Liberty Stadium Head to head Swansea 31, Brentford 28, Draws 22 Referee Stuart Attwell SWANSEA Subs from Nordfeldt, Baker-Richardson, Harries, Narsingh, Asoro, McKay, Dhanda, Dyer Doubtful Dyer (hamstring) Injured Fer (hamstring), Routledge (calf), John (ankle, all 23 Feb), Rodon (foot, Mar), Olsson (achilles, unknown) Suspended None Discipline Y34 R1 BRENTFORD Subs from Daniels, Can\u00f3s, McEachran, Mokotjo, Dasilva, Marcondes, Ogbene, Field, Forss, S\u00f8rensen Doubtful Dalsgaard (hand) Injured Hansen (ankle, Apr), Henry (ankle, unknown), Macleod (hamstring, unknown) Suspended None Discipline Y55 R2",

      "bodyText": "Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard are out for up to three weeks because of injury, with Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r saying that means a chance for Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Romelu Lukaku to step up for Manchester United. Martial and Lingard were forced off during Tuesday\u2019s 2-0 defeat by Paris Saint-Germain at Old Trafford because of groin and hamstring problems respectively. Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cI think they\u2019ll be out for two to three weeks. Then you\u2019re looking at young players [to come in]: Mason Greenwood \u2013 his time to step in and he\u2019s injured unfortunately, out for a couple of weeks as well. Sometimes that\u2019s how the luck goes but Mason will get his chance.\u201d If Martial and Lingard are out for three weeks they will miss Monday\u2019s FA Cup tie at Chelsea, the league games with Liverpool, Crystal Palace and Arsenal, and the Champions League return at PSG. Asked whether this was an opportunity for S\u00e1nchez and Lukaku, Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cYeah, it might be. We\u2019ve got forward options but Angel Gomes and Tahith Chong have been training with us all week so there\u2019s a big chance they\u2019ll be involved. Alexis, Romelu, Chongy or Angel. \u201cAnthony and Jesse have done really well for us; they\u2019re vital. But then again with Romelu and Alexis, they\u2019ve got different skill sets and will be able to show what they can do so we need to gel a team together for Monday. There are quite a few other teams with injuries so you have to adapt to that.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r conceded that in the second-half passage when PSG scored their goals United went into disarray. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to bounce back at this club,\u201d he said. \u201cYou always have challenges here and away against Chelsea is tough.

Apart from that we weren\u2019t too bad. \u201cMaybe PSG was the first game that as a team they came differently from what they did before \u2013 the 3-4-3 system, it\u2019s always a difficult one but games mostly are decided by individual skills and not down to tactics.\u201d This was United\u2019s first loss in Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s 12 matches. \u201cIt\u2019s a different feel, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cI hate losing games, the boys hate it, they\u2019ve been down but there\u2019s no point dwelling on it.

It has been deemed French media\u2019s #MeToo moment.</p> <p>\u201cThey were the Twitter stars of the moment, they seemed untouchable, but I took them on,\u201d Desruol told the Guardian. She contacted one senior website editor in 2010 to complain about his staff, but the abuse continued. She went to the police, who struggled to understand and instead suggested she quit social media. She drafted a letter to editors of major publications to alert them to the actions of their staff. But before it was sent, the draft was leaked online and the abuse got worse.</p> <p>\u201cAt that point I had a burnout.

It also emerged that the websites Huffington Post and Vice had fired several staff over separate closed workplace messaging groups where men allegedly exchanged sexist and racist comments about female colleagues.</p> <p>Amid the outcry, French government ministers announced new laws to make social media platforms pull hateful posts. But many young female journalists said that the abuse was not only taking place online but in real life too, and that it went beyond the League of Lol\u2019s peak activity between 2010 and 2013.</p> <p>The scale of the League of Lol\u2019s targeting of feminists, writers of colour and LGBT men was described by senior journalists this week as \u201cvomit-making\u201d.

The allegations include claims that staff were humiliated, ill-treated and discriminated against because of their caste, a system of social hierarchy among Hindus. A further 32 Indian lawyers and civil rights campaigners have written to Amnesty International\u2019s secretary general in London to demand an independent investigation into the claims from staff members. Parts of the letter were seen by the Guardian. It comes after the human rights group released a report last week identifying a \u201ctoxic\u201d work culture at Amnesty International with widespread bullying, discrimination, public humiliation and other abuses of power. The review of workplace culture was prompted by staff concerns after researcher Ga\u00ebtan Mootoo killed himself in his Paris office. Amnesty India (AI) said it is \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d about the claims made by two senior campaigners and has launched an investigation, chaired by an independent expert. One of the two campaigners resigned in protest last year after her workplace discrimination and harassment claim was dismissed by AI. The second said she was forced to leave after her project was closed, a few months after her allegation of caste-based discrimination was dismissed as unproven. Caste-based discrimination is illegal in India, where 200 million people belong to lower caste, underprivileged communities. Prejudice nonetheless continues, particularly in rural areas. Last year, 11 people died after violence erupted when hundreds of thousands of Dalits, formerly known as \u201cuntouchables\u201d, took part in a mass protest to highlight discrimination they face. Raja Vemula, son of Radhika Vemula, a leading activist on Dalit rights, said his mother has withdrawn her support for AI until the organisation addresses discrimination claims. \u201cAmnesty India and the international secretariat should properly examine the claims that voices of lower caste people inside the organisation have been suppressed,\u201d he said. Chandrasekhar Azad, a rising Dalit leader in Utter Pradesh, who was arrested and imprisoned by the Indian government last year without trial before being granted bail in November, has also withdrawn his support. Mariya Salim, a women\u2019s rights campaigner who worked for AI for eight months before resigning in September, said she felt \u201chumiliated, excluded and denied opportunities unfairly\u201d.

The AI report into her complaint found that a senior manager responded to a suggestion that a lower caste person should be hired to work on caste rights by saying: \u201cAn animal need not be hired to work on animal rights\u201d. The report concluded: \u201cThe committee is of the opinion that it is not caste-based discrimination\u201d. Instead, it said the manager had a \u201cbehavioural problem\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap. Investors were edgy first thing as a number of factors weighed, not least the growing prospect that President Trump was ready to declare a US national emergency on order to push through his border wall with Mexico. Asian markets fell on Friday European markets got off to a subdued start but losses were reversed after reports that US/China trade talks would resume next week in Washington. All key European markets are up sharply The FTSE 100 is up 0.8% or 58 points at 7,254 ONS figures showed UK retail sales rose 1% in January, easily beating expectations as shoppers flocked to the sales. The data helped to push the pound - which had been at a four-month low - back above $1.28 Wall Street opened higher as traders felt optimistic about trade talks and shrugged off a surprise fall in industrial production That\u2019s all for today. Thank you for all your comments and please join us again on Monday. AM Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch say the timing and outcome of the US trade negotiations with China and the EU are the key focus for markets for the rest of the year. They write in a note: Since trade tensions started, we have been optimistic, arguing that no country should want a trade war, but we are now concerned that persistent trade tensions are keeping global growth weak. In this context, a recovery outside the US needs trade deals that will put trade tensions behind, relatively soon. The risk is that another truce between the US and China, while the US and the EU start discussions on trade in autos and agriculture, will keep uncertainty high, delaying the recovery of the global economy. Our baseline still assumes trade deals, but it makes a difference if deals take place in 1Q, or later in the year. And of course, the details of any trade deals will also be important to determine whether we are back in a free trade regime, or a permanent shift toward trade protection has taken place. The opening bell has rung and US shares are higher on trade talk optimism: Dow Jones: +0.7% or 184 points at 25,623 S&amp;P 500: +0.7% or 18 points at 2,764 Nasdaq: +0.6% or 44 points at 7,471 Figures just out show US manufacturing output fell 0.9% in January, which was worse than the 0.1% predicted by economists. The figure for December was also revised down, to show a 0.8% rise compared with a previous estimate of 1.1%. The broader measure of industrial production was also disappointing, down 0.6% in January compared with the 0.1% rise forecast. December was revised down to 0.1% growth from 0.3% previously. It was the first fall since last May. US futures are pointing to a higher open on Wall Street, as US/China trade talk hopes are revived on reports that negotiations will continue in Washington next week: Dow Jones: +0.4% or 107 points S&amp;P 500: +0.5% or 12.5 points Nasdaq: +0.5% or 38 points Time for a quick summary of the corporate news doing the rounds today: RBS said Brexit uncertainty has \u201cgone on far too long\u201d, as the bailed out bank reported a doubling of profits in 2018 and fresh dividend payouts that will hand the government \u00a31bn Premier Foods has abandoned plans to sell-off Ambrosia, its custard and rice pudding brand, blaming the current business climate for a lack of acceptable offers PepsiCo has warned that earnings will fall this year for a number of reasons, including a stronger dollar, a higher tax bill, and an increase in investment Patisserie Valerie\u2019s administrators announced the \u00a32.5m sale of its Baker &amp; Spice bread cafes to the Department of Coffee and Social Affairs chain Just Eat said it had reached a milestone of 500m orders in the UK, in a week when activist investor Cat Rock Capital Management pushed for the takeaway firm to merge with a rival The FTSE 100 is currently at a four-month high, up 0.4% or 26 points at 7,223. Conor Campbell, analyst at spread-betting firm Spreadex, reflects on the latest developments in the US/China trade talks: A significant shift in sentiment occurred on Friday morning following the latest trade talks update. After a few days of discussion in Beijing, President Xi Jinping has said that the talks will continue in Washington next week, both sides still chasing that elusive deal before the ceasefire ceases at the start of March. This faint whiff of progress was enough to cause the markets to reverse the losses that had come after the double-hit of Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018national emergency\u2019 chat and China\u2019s inflation-slowdown. With the market cheering the apparent US-China progress, it is going to be interesting to see how much the trade war fears have weighed on the latest round of American data, including the industrial production and consumer sentiment figures. Here is our full story on those better-than-expected UK retail sales: Reuters brings this report following talks in Beijing this week between US and Chinese trade negotiators: Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Friday trade talks with the United States will continue in Washington next week and that he hopes the two sides will be able to reach a mutually beneficial deal in the upcoming negotiations, state media reported. Xi said during a meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that talks in Beijing this week made progress and that China is willing to solve economic and trade disputes with the United States via cooperation, according to a report by Xinhua. Lighthizer and Mnuchin said during the meeting that they maintain hope although there is still much work to be done, and that they are willing to work with China to reach a deal that is in line with the interests of both countries, according to Xinhua. Sentiment among European investors has become a little more positive as the morning has gone one. It seems that traders are clinging on to the merest suggestion of progress between US and China\u2019s trade negotiators in Beijing. Steven Mnuchin, the US trade secretary, said in a tweet that the meetings in China were \u201cproductive\u201d, offering no other detail (and still no sign of a memorandum of understanding): Here\u2019s how markets are looking: FTSE 100: +0.2% at 7,212 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.1% at 11,098 France\u2019s CAC: +0.8% at 5,103 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.4% at 19,911 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.5% at 8,999 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.5% at 366 UK consumers are still in \u201chappy-go-lucky\u201d mood according to Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics. January\u2019s jump in retail sales shows that most households have maintained a happy-go-lucky mentality, despite the fraught political situation. While consumers\u2019 confidence is down, this reflects rather fuzzy expectations that Brexit might be costly eventually. Right now, households\u2019 real incomes are being supported by low inflation, a decade-high rate of nominal wage growth and solid employment gains. Low confidence will prompt consumers to hold back from buying cars, booking holidays and moving home, but the high street will be protected. Thomas Pugh, economist at Capital Economics, agrees that the outlook for retail sales in the coming weeks and months is heavily dependent on the Brexit outcome: In contrast to the Brexit pessimism, which seems to be weighing on other sectors, the rise in retail sales volumes in January implies that consumers are still willing to spend. Of course, unless a Brexit deal is signed soon, sales could weaken over the rest of Q1. However, if a no deal Brexit is avoided, consumers should be in a good position to ramp up spending in the second half of the year. James Smith, an economist at ING bank, warns that the positive retail sales figures mask a tough backdrop for the UK high street: Brexit uncertainty is likely to keep a lid on spending over the next few months. Despite an improvement in real wage growth, consumer confidence remains at the lowest level since 2013, led by concerns about both the economic climate and personal finances. There is a risk that, as the Brexit deadline draws nearer, nervousness about the impact of \u2018no deal\u2019 will creep into the consumer mindset. At the very least, shoppers may opt against bigger ticket purchases in the short-term, instead choosing to maintain savings levels. At 4.2%, the annual rate of growth in retail sales is the strongest in more than three years (since December 2016). The stronger-than-expected retail sales have helped the pound a tad, which is now roughly flat against the dollar at $1.2809. However, Moneycorp\u2019s Lee McDarby says investor minds are elsewhere: Despite Brexit uncertainty and a stuttering economy, consumers have begun 2019 in a buoyant mood. These better than expected results may have been helped by the surprise drop in inflation, putting more money in consumer\u2019s pockets. After a week of poor economic data, these figures are unlikely to have much impact on the pound. Moreover, in today\u2019s currency market the strength of Sterling is largely being determined by markets\u2019 expectation of a deal or no deal. Rhian Murphy, head of retail sales at the ONS, said price discounts helped to convince shoppers to splash out on clothing in January: Retail sales returned to growth, with increases across most sectors. Clothing stores saw strong sales, luring consumers with price reductions with food sales also growing after a slight dip over Christmas. Breaking: UK retail sales rose 1% in January, easily beating expectations of a 0.2% increase. The figure for December was also revised up, to show a 0.7 fall, compared with the previously estimated fall of 0.9%. It lifted the annual rate of growth to 4.2%, from 3.1% a month earlier. It\u2019s almost time for UK retail sales data, which will give the latest insight into consumer willingness to spend as Brexit nears. City economists are expecting the Office for National Statistics to say sales rose 0.2% in January, following a 0.9% fall in December. The figures are out at 9.30am. The pound has dipped below the $1.28 after Theresa May\u2019s latest Brexit defeat in the Commons on Thursday. Sterling is down 0.2% at $1.2792 after the vote cast fresh doubt that the PM has the power to win parliament\u2019s support for an amended EU withdrawal agreement. The pound is faring slightly better against the euro, up 0.1% at \u20ac1.1350. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, puts the RBS numbers into context: RBS delivered a stellar set of numbers and a forecast-beating dividend payout to investors, but Brexit and other factors mean it will fall short on its cost cutting target. On the whole this was just what investors have been waiting for. Profits rose to \u00a31.6bn, ahead of the consensus for around \u00a31.4bn and more than double the \u00a3752m a year ago. Shares could well continue their 2019 ascent today, although the prospect of the government selling down its stake will act as a residual weight on the stock performance. The real question is just how quickly the Treasury decides to sell down its stake. Philip Hammond may well feel that a selling the roughly \u00a318bn the government owns would be a nice little bonus for his Brexit war chest. At \u00a32.41 on the close yesterday the shares are worth half what the government paid for them, but needs must some times. RBS shares are currently down 0.4% at 240.6p. Royal Bank of Scotland has kicked off the UK banks\u2019 reporting season this morning with better than expected results. Profits more than doubled in 2018, to \u00a31.6bn from just \u00a3752m a year earlier. It was the second consecutive year of profit for the bank since its \u00a345bn state bailout in 2008, and prompted RBS to payout dividends that will include \u00a31bn for the public purse.

Donald Trump\u2019s readiness to declare a national emergency in order to build his border wall with Mexico has been weighing on on investor minds overnight. Wall Street fell on Thursday, and Asian markets followed on Friday, with sentiment also hit by a surprise slide in US retail sales, which fell 1.2% in December - the biggest fall in nine years.

      "body": "<p>The era in American politics dominated by Donald Trump truly began in November 2008 with the election of Barack Obama. Obama\u2019s historic victory generated Republican fear of an extinction event through demographic change and the emergence of a younger, more diverse Democratic coalition with the potential to hold a durable popular majority. The Trump phenomenon was in large part a reaction to that perceived threat. Even after the shock of Trump\u2019s victory, a massive resistance formed first in marches, and in grass roots organizing, and then in the efforts of progressive states. Who\u2019s leading the pack? Undoubtedly, California.</p> <p>California has long operated as a laboratory for progressive causes: before they became Trump\u2019s nemesis, California\u2019s empowered Democrats acted as wing support to the Obama administration, testing out strategies too bold for the harsh constraints that Obama faced in DC, where a Republican Congress fought him at every turn.</p> <p>And what a giant laboratory it is!</p> <p>California is practically a country unto itself, with a GDP now greater than the UK\u2019s, and the 5th largest in the world. With nearly 40 million people, California contains one out of eight Americans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55ac7052776b04a55a7184fdc8c64fc088205cd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55ac7052776b04a55a7184fdc8c64fc088205cd2/0_67_4680_2809/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Attorney General Xavier Becerra filed multiple lawsuits against Trump actions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Attorney General Xavier Becerra filed multiple lawsuits against Trump actions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The issues that animated politics in the Obama-Trump era were precisely those that most impacted California. Los Angeles and Orange counties are home to nearly 10% of the country\u2019s more than 11 million undocumented residents. Five percent of all Medicaid recipients live in LA County. With its glorious coastline, the state has resisted offshore oil drilling and has been at the center of the struggle to tighten fuel standards on cars.</p> <p>After helping Obama, leading the resistance against Trump was the natural next step. The state moved quickly to defend the very policies it had initiated in the Obama era: tightening automobile fuel standards beyond federal requirements, protecting the rights of undocumented residents, and expanding Medicaid beyond the federal minimum against Trump\u2019s moves to roll back fuel standards, eliminate the Affordable Care Act, and remove protections for immigrants and refugees.</p> <p>When Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accords, Governor Jerry Brown and other political leaders went overseas to keep the flame alive, acting almost as leaders of their own nation-state. Attorney General Xavier Becerra filed multiple lawsuits against the Trump administration. California passed a sanctuary law that limited how much local law enforcement could cooperate with federal authorities in enforcing federal immigration law<strong>.</strong></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After helping Obama, leading the resistance against Trump was the natural next step</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The nationalization of politics in the Obama-Trump era brought California Democrats onto the national stage, first quietly for Obama and then loudly against Trump. Before, California was not much of a force in national Democratic politics, except as a place to raise campaign money. The state\u2019s national pull was all on the Republican side, nurturing the presidential ambitions of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. The California primary came so late in the presidential year that the state\u2019s millions of Democratic voters were largely shut out of the choice of the Democratic nominee (a situation now rectified by the state\u2019s move to a March primary).</p> <p>In this massive state, California\u2019s Democrats have two bases: San Francisco and Los Angeles.</p> <p>The best organized and most powerful Democratic locale has long been San Francisco. Former Governor Pat Brown built the modern California Democratic party here in the 1950s. The legendary Assembly Speaker Willie Brown did the same in his era. Today, leading Democrats call San Francisco their political home, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senator Dianne Feinstein, top tier presidential candidate Senator Kamala Harris, and the new governor, Gavin Newsom. Newsom has already shown that he will even more aggressive than Jerry Brown in confronting the Trump administration by announcing that he will withdraw the state\u2019s National Guard from most of the border enforcement duties that Brown had, with some limitations, agreed to provide.</p> <p>But Southern California, long derided for low participation and a disengaged political culture, is slowly coming into its own. One out of four Californians lives in LA County, where the issues of immigration and health care are life and death. The Southland has generated the popular LA mayor, Eric Garcetti, newly crowned House committee chairs Adam Schiff (Intelligence) and Maxine Waters (Banking); Attorney General Becerra, and the powerful Speaker of the Assembly, Anthony Rendon. Ironically, it was the high turnout shift to Democrats in hitherto sleepy Southern California counties that flipped seven of the 23 House seats Democrats needed nationally to put Nancy Pelosi into the Speaker\u2019s Chair, where she demonstrated the power of her San Francisco political skills in her confrontations with Donald Trump.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>California\u2019s Republicans, once competitive here, are heading downhill at a fast clip</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>California\u2019s Republicans, once competitive here, are heading downhill at a fast clip, as their share of voter registration falls steadily and their ranks of elected officials crash. After November, Democrats held three quarters of all seats in the state legislature and all but 7 House seats, and Republicans have not won a statewide office since 2006. A number of leading Republicans are calling on the party to become more ideologically moderate, especially on social issues and immigration. Others, noting Trump\u2019s popularity within the party and continuing Republican power in Washington, DC, are tying themselves to national Republicans as their own kind of wing support, in a resistance to the Democratic-led resistance.</p> <p>The new Democratic governor and his massive majority in the legislature may have all the power in the world, but they also have an immense responsibility.

      "bodyText": "The era in American politics dominated by Donald Trump truly began in November 2008 with the election of Barack Obama. Obama\u2019s historic victory generated Republican fear of an extinction event through demographic change and the emergence of a younger, more diverse Democratic coalition with the potential to hold a durable popular majority. The Trump phenomenon was in large part a reaction to that perceived threat. Even after the shock of Trump\u2019s victory, a massive resistance formed first in marches, and in grass roots organizing, and then in the efforts of progressive states. Who\u2019s leading the pack? Undoubtedly, California. California has long operated as a laboratory for progressive causes: before they became Trump\u2019s nemesis, California\u2019s empowered Democrats acted as wing support to the Obama administration, testing out strategies too bold for the harsh constraints that Obama faced in DC, where a Republican Congress fought him at every turn. And what a giant laboratory it is! California is practically a country unto itself, with a GDP now greater than the UK\u2019s, and the 5th largest in the world. With nearly 40 million people, California contains one out of eight Americans. The issues that animated politics in the Obama-Trump era were precisely those that most impacted California. Los Angeles and Orange counties are home to nearly 10% of the country\u2019s more than 11 million undocumented residents. Five percent of all Medicaid recipients live in LA County. With its glorious coastline, the state has resisted offshore oil drilling and has been at the center of the struggle to tighten fuel standards on cars. After helping Obama, leading the resistance against Trump was the natural next step. The state moved quickly to defend the very policies it had initiated in the Obama era: tightening automobile fuel standards beyond federal requirements, protecting the rights of undocumented residents, and expanding Medicaid beyond the federal minimum against Trump\u2019s moves to roll back fuel standards, eliminate the Affordable Care Act, and remove protections for immigrants and refugees. When Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accords, Governor Jerry Brown and other political leaders went overseas to keep the flame alive, acting almost as leaders of their own nation-state. Attorney General Xavier Becerra filed multiple lawsuits against the Trump administration. California passed a sanctuary law that limited how much local law enforcement could cooperate with federal authorities in enforcing federal immigration law. The nationalization of politics in the Obama-Trump era brought California Democrats onto the national stage, first quietly for Obama and then loudly against Trump. Before, California was not much of a force in national Democratic politics, except as a place to raise campaign money. The state\u2019s national pull was all on the Republican side, nurturing the presidential ambitions of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. The California primary came so late in the presidential year that the state\u2019s millions of Democratic voters were largely shut out of the choice of the Democratic nominee (a situation now rectified by the state\u2019s move to a March primary). In this massive state, California\u2019s Democrats have two bases: San Francisco and Los Angeles. The best organized and most powerful Democratic locale has long been San Francisco. Former Governor Pat Brown built the modern California Democratic party here in the 1950s. The legendary Assembly Speaker Willie Brown did the same in his era. Today, leading Democrats call San Francisco their political home, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senator Dianne Feinstein, top tier presidential candidate Senator Kamala Harris, and the new governor, Gavin Newsom. Newsom has already shown that he will even more aggressive than Jerry Brown in confronting the Trump administration by announcing that he will withdraw the state\u2019s National Guard from most of the border enforcement duties that Brown had, with some limitations, agreed to provide. But Southern California, long derided for low participation and a disengaged political culture, is slowly coming into its own. One out of four Californians lives in LA County, where the issues of immigration and health care are life and death. The Southland has generated the popular LA mayor, Eric Garcetti, newly crowned House committee chairs Adam Schiff (Intelligence) and Maxine Waters (Banking); Attorney General Becerra, and the powerful Speaker of the Assembly, Anthony Rendon. Ironically, it was the high turnout shift to Democrats in hitherto sleepy Southern California counties that flipped seven of the 23 House seats Democrats needed nationally to put Nancy Pelosi into the Speaker\u2019s Chair, where she demonstrated the power of her San Francisco political skills in her confrontations with Donald Trump. California\u2019s Republicans, once competitive here, are heading downhill at a fast clip, as their share of voter registration falls steadily and their ranks of elected officials crash. After November, Democrats held three quarters of all seats in the state legislature and all but 7 House seats, and Republicans have not won a statewide office since 2006. A number of leading Republicans are calling on the party to become more ideologically moderate, especially on social issues and immigration. Others, noting Trump\u2019s popularity within the party and continuing Republican power in Washington, DC, are tying themselves to national Republicans as their own kind of wing support, in a resistance to the Democratic-led resistance. The new Democratic governor and his massive majority in the legislature may have all the power in the world, but they also have an immense responsibility. In an era in which progressive parties worldwide are struggling to compete with right wing populist movements, the Democrats have shown considerable signs of life, particularly in California. Much, however, rests on what they do with their power. If California Democrats make good policy in health care, immigration and other areas, they will help define the Democratic presidential campaign in 2020; if they fall short, or design poorly, they will damage their party\u2019s prospects. Will California\u2019s next performance be role model or cautionary tale? \u2022 Raphael J Sonenshein is a political scientist and executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at Cal State LA",

Labour MPs will need to decide whether their patience with their leadership is finite.</p> \n   <p>And Downing Street, too, will face a difficult decision. The risk of the Cooper-Letwin bill passing is that the rug will be pulled from under the prime minister\u2019s strategy. Currently, the government can obfuscate. The Brexit secretary can stand up and strongly hint that the government will pursue no deal. Meanwhile the lead Brexit negotiator can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/13/brexit-minister-downplays-article-50-extension\">loudly state in a Brussels bar</a> that the government will tack to an extension. An extension would change the balance of options, and the prime minister would be forced to choose. May might have to secure some concessions from the EU before 27 February, or face running out of road.</p> \n   <p>So, once again, we have a two-week buildup to a parliamentary showdown, but this time it may actually be one that matters. However the one thing that has become clear is that whatever our parliamentarians do, they will do it grudgingly. No one likes the deal. Relatively few favour a referendum, and virtually no one genuinely thinks no deal is a desirable outcome.</p> \n   <p>Which means that, whatever happens, this will not have been a healing process. Rather, MPs will emerge dissatisfied with whatever has happened, claiming not to have supported it and laying the groundwork for battle to resume as the debate over our future relationship with the EU commences in earnest. Oh joy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/15/angry-parliament-defeated-brexit-votes-mps\">This angry, embittered parliament has been defeated by Brexit | Anand Menon</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c66caaee4b0bdb6048fc807\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/gwilym-mumford\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-15T14:20:48.404Z\">2.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The BBC\u2019s long-running late-night politics show This Week is to end after its presenter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/andrew-neil\">Andrew Neil</a> announced he was stepping down.</p> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc\">BBC</a> One show, which airs on Thursdays after Question Time, will be taken off air this summer when its current series ends, the corporation said.</p> \n  <p>Neil has fronted the show since it began in 2003 and regular guests include former Conservative MP Michael Portillo and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott.</p> \n  <p>Fran Unsworth, BBC director of news, said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t imagine This Week without the inimitable Andrew Neil, one of Britain\u2019s best political interviewers.

Essentially that is what will happen if we don\u2019t vote for a deal.\u201d</p> \n  <p>She added: \u201cThe government does not want no-deal. It is there because that is the legal default position. And any competent government must prepare for all eventualities.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Earlier in the programme the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, warned that as many as six cabinet ministers could resign if the government failed to extend article 50. Leadsom said: \u201cResignations from government do happen. People have very strong heartfelt views about Brexit.\u201d</p> \n  <p>She added: \u201cWhat the government is seeking to do is to sort out the arrangements on the backstop so that parliament can vote for the deal. That is the government\u2019s sole focus.\u201d </p> \n  <p>She also defended the PM\u2019s absence from the Commons when the result of the vote was read out. \u201cThe prime minister just this week spent two hour and 18 minutes answering questions in the chamber. Since October she spent 39 hours in the chamber answering questions. She has shown such commitment to making herself available to the House.\u201d</p> \n  <p>She added: \u201cThe vote yesterday didn\u2019t change anything. The government\u2019s position remains to resolve the issues of the backstop and then come back to parliament with a fresh meaningful vote. It is essential that we crack on with that work.\u201d</p> \n  <p>On the ERG\u2019s failure to back the government, Leadsom said \u201cthey were concerned that in supporting the motion it might indicate that they supported taking no-deal off the table.\u201d</p> \n  <p>She added: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t to say that they no longer support the prime minister\u2019s attempts to get the backstop renegotiated, which is the very clear vote that we had a couple of weeks ago. So the prime minister carries on. She will continue to seek those legally binding changes to the backstop that will enable parliament to support her deal. Yesterday was more of a hiccup than the disaster that is being reported.\u201d </p> \n  <p>She also urged the EU to compromise on the backstop: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If the EU were to bring on the one thing that they have said they are determined to avoid, that is the risk of the UK leaving the EU without a deal at the end of March and thereby having to have some kind of hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. So it simply would not make sense to precipitate such a conundrum when the option of a negotiated arrangement, where the UK could put in place alternative arrangements for the backstop, would be far preferable from everybody\u2019s point of view including from the perspective of the issue of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Leadsom conceded that the vote could harm negotiations with Brussels:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The one problem with last night\u2019s vote is that it allows the EU to continue with this pretence that they don\u2019t know what we want. They do know what we want. It was quite clear from the vote two weeks ago that what parliament wants to see is the issues around the backstop resolved in a legally binding way. What last night\u2019s vote was quite clearly about was the Labour party playing politics, because they decided to vote against what was a very unharmful motion, merely setting out the prime minister needs more time to deal that the issues with the House raised two weeks ago. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-15T10:23:31.337Z\">at 10.23am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c667763e4b071a680340f47\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-15T08:26:57.141Z\">8.26am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"22e9995997bdd04630ad9f3e7f6134b61fa4b841\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22e9995997bdd04630ad9f3e7f6134b61fa4b841/1225_27_1517_1896/800.jpg\" alt=\"George Katrougalos\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Katrougalos</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alkis Konstantinidis/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Greek foreign minister George Katrougalos told Today that Thursday\u2019s Commons vote was \u201cpart of the contradictory message that we are receiving as the 27 from the UK\u201d. </p> \n  <p>Katrougalos said: \u201cIt complicates even further the situation.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s your lot today. Here\u2019s a roundup: Theresa May will insist to EU leaders that her defeat in parliament on Thursday does not change her belief that her Brexit deal can still achieve a majority - as long as there are changes to the backstop. The prime minister hopes that other EU leaders will be more understanding of the kind of parliamentary game-playing seen on Thursday than officials in Brussels. Pro-Remain Tories have reacted angrily to May\u2019s latest Brexit set back after abstentions from the ERG group led to a government defeat by 45 votes. Sarah Wollaston repeated her threat to leave the party over the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. She also backed calls for the ERG to join Nigel Farage\u2019s new Brexit party. The ERG denied it was holding the UK to ransom. But its deputy chairman Steve Baker said the group could not be associated with \u201ctaking no deal off the table\u201d. The government continued to send mixed-messages about whether a no-deal Brexit is part of its bargaining tactics. Foreign office minister, Alistair Burt, tweeted: \u201cWe are not leaving without a deal\u201d. But Commons leader Andrea Leadsom insisted it remained on the table. European politicians have expressed more exasperation with the UK over Brexit. France\u2019s Europe minister, Nathalie Loiseua, told the UK to \u201churry up\u201d. Greek foreign minister, George Katrougalos, said the vote was \u201cpart of the contradictory message that we are receiving as the 27 from the UK\u201d. Hilary Benn, chair of the Brexit committee, said he would reintroduce an amendment on indicative votes for a possible solution to the Brexit impasse. He said: \u201cIf parliament can\u2019t decide ... then I think you might end up having to go back to the British people.\u201d Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, has warned that that more than 12 ministers could resign by the end of the month if May refuses to extend the Brexit negotiating period. He said that resignations on this scale could bring down the government. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said it is possible that the UK will ask for an extension to Article 50 beyond the 29 March deadline for leaving the EU. He also suggested talking to Jeremy Corbyn over a drink on how the Labour leader could take a more constructive approach to Brexit. Ireland\u2019s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said he would like further discussion between the Conservatives and Labour to be held on Brexit. Downing Street criticised thousands of school children taking part in the climate strike. A spokeswomn said: \u201cdisruption increases teachers\u2019 workloads and wastes lesson time that teachers have carefully prepared for\u201d. But Jeremy Corbyn said the strike was \u201cinspiring\u201d. Analysis of Commons voting patterns show how Europhobe and Europhile rebels from both main parties are forming new parliamentary blocs, according to the Guardian\u2019s fancy new interactive. Our study clusters MPs by the similarity of their voting patterns: if two MPs always vote the same way, the chart groups them tightly together. The patterns on key Brexit votes reveal the emergence of four cross-party political factions that are wrangling for control of the negotiations. A cross-party group of pro-European MPs usually votes with each other, with or against their own frontbenches, while Europhobe Conservatives now constitute a party within the party. The genuine moment of truth on Brexit looks increasingly likely to come on 27 February, according to Anand Menon, director of UK in a Changing Europe. Remainer cabinet ministers who have threatened to resign if no deal looks likely will have to choose whether they are just mouth or have trousers too. Labour MPs will need to decide whether their patience with their leadership is finite. And Downing Street, too, will face a difficult decision. The risk of the Cooper-Letwin bill passing is that the rug will be pulled from under the prime minister\u2019s strategy. Currently, the government can obfuscate. The Brexit secretary can stand up and strongly hint that the government will pursue no deal. Meanwhile the lead Brexit negotiator can loudly state in a Brussels bar that the government will tack to an extension. An extension would change the balance of options, and the prime minister would be forced to choose. May might have to secure some concessions from the EU before 27 February, or face running out of road. So, once again, we have a two-week buildup to a parliamentary showdown, but this time it may actually be one that matters. However the one thing that has become clear is that whatever our parliamentarians do, they will do it grudgingly. No one likes the deal. Relatively few favour a referendum, and virtually no one genuinely thinks no deal is a desirable outcome. Which means that, whatever happens, this will not have been a healing process. Rather, MPs will emerge dissatisfied with whatever has happened, claiming not to have supported it and laying the groundwork for battle to resume as the debate over our future relationship with the EU commences in earnest. Oh joy. The BBC\u2019s long-running late-night politics show This Week is to end after its presenter Andrew Neil announced he was stepping down. The BBC One show, which airs on Thursdays after Question Time, will be taken off air this summer when its current series ends, the corporation said. Neil has fronted the show since it began in 2003 and regular guests include former Conservative MP Michael Portillo and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott. Fran Unsworth, BBC director of news, said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t imagine This Week without the inimitable Andrew Neil, one of Britain\u2019s best political interviewers. After 16 years, Andrew is bowing out of late-night presenting on the show, at the top of his game.\u201d Theresa May will insist to EU leaders that her defeat in parliament on Thursday does not change her belief that her Brexit deal can still achieve a majority - as long as there are changes to the backstop. May is likely to head to Brussels next week after another crushing defeat in parliament inflicted by Eurosceptic backbenchers, as well as speaking to more EU leaders over the weekend. The prime minister hopes that other EU leaders will be more understanding of the kind of parliamentary game-playing seen on Thursday than officials in Brussels. \u201cThey are all politicians,\u201d said a government source. Privately, Downing Street is exasperated by what it regards as self-interested posturing by some MPs. Sources described the prime minister as furious in the voting lobbies on Wednesday night. On Friday, May\u2019s spokeswoman said the previous vote in January, where MPs passed an amendment demanding the backstop be replaced with alternative arrangements and rejected the possibility of no deal, was the only one which had spelt out what parliament would accept. \u201cThe motion on the 29th of January remains the only one the Commons has passed expressing what it does want, and that is what we are pursuing,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cThat remains the case after last night\u2019s vote, and that what is what the prime minister is focused on. \u201cIf we do not pass a deal, the legal position is that we leave without one. We do not want that to happen. And the PM is working tirelessly to make the changes so that MPs can pass the deal when we bring it back.\u201d Royal Bank of Scotland has said Brexit uncertainty has \u201cgone on far too long\u201d, despite posting better-than-expected full-year profits and declaring new dividends that will boost government coffers by \u00a31bn. RBS\u2019s chief executive, Ross McEwan, admitted the additional pressure of Brexit risks would affect the bank\u2019s performance over the coming year and it may struggle to meet its target of getting costs below 50% of its income by 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in saying that the political uncertainty around Brexithas gone on far too long,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cOur corporate clients are pausing before making financial decisions and this, of course, is damaging the UK economy and will affect our income performance.\u201d Finance ministers from Scotland and Wales are demanding clarity from Westminster about post-Brexit funding, before a meeting with the chief secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, in Cardiff later on Friday. Scotland\u2019s finance secretary Derek Mackay and Welsh finance minister Rebecca Evans have asked the UK government to explain post-Brexit replacements for EU cash streams like university research grants, rural community funding and public sector pensions, with Mackay calling for a guarantee that all funding will be replaced \u201cin full\u201d. In advance of the meeting, Mackay said: \u201cFunding from the EU supports jobs in Scotland, from major infrastructure projects to sustaining rural communities and delivering research funding for our world-class universities. That is why the Scottish government is determined to defend its hard-won fiscal responsibility and maintain the benefits that EU funding has provided to many sectors and individuals in Scotland. \u201cWith just weeks to go until the planned EU exit day, we remain deeply concerned about the lack of detail regarding replacement arrangements for EU funding streams given their importance to individuals, businesses and communities across Scotland. \u201cToday I will be calling on the chief secretary to the Treasury to provide reassurance that Scotland should not be financially worse off as a result of EU exit and to guarantee that all lost EU funding will be replaced in full.\u201d Britain could accept legally-binding assurances on the backstop that would not require reopening withdrawal agreement, diplomatic sources have told Reuters. This potential shift from the UK\u2019s officials line came after talks earlier this week between UK\u2019s Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, it said. London is still seeking changes to the backstop that the EU has already ruled out. \u201cPotentially those things can be achieved without changing the withdrawal agreement,\u201d a UK official said of the legal guarantees on the backstop that London was seeking. \u201cIf they can get what they want through other means they\u2019ll accept that the Withdrawal Agreement will not be reopened,\u201d one EU diplomat said of what was discussed during the Barnier-Barclay meeting. \u201cBut they still want a time limit on the backstop or a unilateral exit,\u201d another one said. \u201cBarnier said \u2018no\u2019.\u201d Barclay is due to meet ambassadors of EU states in London on Friday before coming back to Brussels on Monday for more talks with Barnier. The pro-EU group Best for Britain has expressed alarm at Leadsom\u2019s claim that the government could not take a no-deal Brexit off the table. One of its supporters, Labour MP, Virendra Sharma MP said: \u201cThis is beyond disgraceful. The country is on the brink of catastrophe, and the government continues to use all the dirtiest tricks in the book to scare us into backing their shoddy deal. But we won\u2019t be intimidated. \u201cThe humiliating defeat last night shows the government\u2019s hands are tied. It\u2019s clear the only route forward now is to bring the honest and proud people of this country back into the Brexit process. They deserve to be heard.\u201d The BBC\u2019s Europe editor Katya Adler has a helpful Twitter thread on the possibility of EU concessions. She warns that none will emerge from Brussels unless and until consensus is reached in the UK Parliament. Ross Thomson, the Tory MP being investigated by his party over allegations of \u201csexual touching\u201d in a House of Commons bar has said it would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d to comment at this stage, PA reports. The MP for Aberdeen South, faced claims about his behaviour at the Strangers Bar at the House of Commons on 5 February. Police confirmed they spoke to three men but no formal allegations and no arrests were made. On Twitter last week, Thomson said he had referred himself to the Conservative Party\u2019s disciplinary panel \u201cin the interests of openness and transparency\u201d, describing the allegations as \u201ccompletely false\u201d. Speaking to the BBC outside his constituency office in Aberdeen, Thomson said he would be willing to discuss what had happened in more detail following the conclusion of the investigation. Thomson said: \u201cGiven that there is potentially a live process, as well as my own referral to our party\u2019s internal investigation, it would be really inappropriate to comment at this time. \u201cI\u2019d be more than happy to sit down with you at some point to talk to you exactly about what happened and what the last few weeks have actually been like but given that there could still be a really live process on right now, it would be inappropriate to comment given that I\u2019ve had no confirmation from the commissioner\u2019s office that a complaint has in fact been dismissed and that I also did refer myself to the party\u2019s internal investigation so I\u2019m still awaiting clarity on that, too.\u201d Thomson said he remains committed in his work as an MP and accepted his constituents deserved an explanation. \u201cAbsolutely, which is why I\u2019m more than happy to sit down with you, we will do that, I\u2019m going to talk to people about exactly what did happen, what happened over the last few weeks and how it\u2019s been,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cI am committed to my constituents, which is why I\u2019m in the office today working on the issues that are really important to them\u201d. Sarah Wollaston, chair of the health select committee, has repeated her threat to quit the Tory party over the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Speaking to BBC2\u2019s Politics Live she suggested she was on the brink of quitting the party, while ministers were considering resigning from the government. She said: If it becomes main government policy to deliver no-deal I shall leave. I will sit as an independent, because of the extraordinary damage that would inflict. We are rapidly reaching that point and we have heard that there are many government ministers also considering their position, because they would not be prepared to knowingly and deliberately inflict the kind of pain that would be involved. She also backed Richard Harrington\u2019s suggestion that the ERG should join Nigel Farage\u2019s new Brexit party. She said: I think they would be much more comfortable there. I think they have significantly shifted the Conservative party to the right. We heard repeatedly from the secretary of state that they were going to go ahead with no-deal, even though that was given as as an assurance from the despatch box the ERG still voted against her \u2013 enough abstained to mean she would lose the vote. They are dictating policy at every level now. They have their own leadership, their own whip, they are a party within a party. It is time for the prime minister to see that these people are not going to back her. There are very many of us who are very concerned about eh way that the party has significantly shifted to the right, and that is under direct influence of the ERG. Ireland\u2019s foreign minister said he cannot believe the British Government has let the issue of a no-deal Brexit get this far. \u201cI think it is extraordinary and unbelievable really that the British Parliament and British Government have let it come to this,\u201d Coveney said. \u201cI do, however, believe that Theresa May is sincere and does want to protect the Good Friday Agreement.\u201d \u201cForty-two days out until Britain is due to leave, there is still divisions in a political party causing Ireland to spend hundreds of millions of euro to prepare for no deal.\u201d Coveney added that he would like further discussion between the Conservatives and Labour to be held on Brexit. \u201cThe EU will try to accommodate the PM but will have to be reasonable. Labour in the UK are important in these discussions. \u201cCertainly it would be helpful to see serious dialogue between the two large parties in Westminster, and it needs to happen yesterday. But Jeremy Corbyn is backing the school climate strike: Other opposition politicians have also expressed their support. Away from Brexit, Downing Street has criticised school children taking part in today\u2019s climate change strike. It said that while it was important for young people to engage with issues like climate change, the disruption to planned lesson time was damaging for pupils. A No 10 spokeswoman said: \u201cEverybody wants young people to be engaged in the issues that affect them most so that we can build a brighter future for all of us. \u201cBut it is important to emphasise that disruption increases teachers\u2019 workloads and wastes lesson time that teachers have carefully prepared for. \u201cThat time is crucial for young people, precisely so that they can develop into the top scientists, engineers and advocates we need to help tackle this problem.\u201d Here\u2019s a Friday morning roundup: Pro-Remain Tories have reacted angrily to Theresa May\u2019s latest Brexit set back after abstentions from the ERG group led to a government defeat by 45 votes. Nick Boles, the Grantham MP, tweeted: \u201cMaybe, just maybe, the penny will now drop with prime minister and her chief whip that the hardliners in the ERG want a no-deal Brexit and will stop at nothing to get it.\u201d The ERG denied it was holding the UK to ransom. But its deputy chairman Steve Baker said the group could not be associated with \u201ctaking no deal off the table\u201d. The government continued to send mixed-messages about whether a no-deal Brexit is part of its bargaining tactics. Foreign office minister, Alistair Burt, tweeted: \u201cWe are not leaving without a deal\u201d. But Commons leader Andrea Leadsom insisted it remained on the table. European politicians have expressed more exasperation with the UK over Brexit. France\u2019s Europe minister, Nathalie Loiseua, told the UK to \u201churry up\u201d. Greek foreign minister, George Katrougalos, said the vote was \u201cpart of the contradictory message that we are receiving as the 27 from the UK\u201d. Hilary Benn, chair of the Brexit committee, said he would reintroduce an amendment on indicative votes for a possible solution to the Brexit impasse. He said: \u201cIf parliament can\u2019t decide ... then I think you might end up having to go back to the British people.\u201d Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, has warned that that more than 12 ministers could resign by the end of the month if May refuses to extend the Brexit negotiating period. He said that resignations on this scale could bring down the government. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said it is possible that the UK will ask for an extension to Article 50 beyond the 29 March deadline for leaving the EU. He also suggested talking to Jeremy Corbyn over a drink on how the Labour leader could take a more constructive approach to Brexit. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said it is possible that the UK will ask for an extension to Article 50 beyond the 29 March deadline for leaving the EU. Reuters quotes him telling reporters: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s inevitable, it\u2019s certainly possible. If there is going to be an extension, it needs to be with a purpose, it needs to be with a view to securing and ratifying an agreement.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would like to see this stalemate or impasse or period of purgatory continue for months and months and months.\u201d He also repeated Ireland\u2019s plea for UK\u2019s MPs to back Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement. PA quoted him saying: \u201cThere is a deal on the table that reflects compromises on both sides. \u201cIt\u2019s not a perfect deal but a fair deal and guarantees no hard border on this island. \u201cI had hoped the UK would ratify the deal.\u201d But he would not be drawn on giving advice to Jeremy Corbyn. He said he \u201chas views\u201d on whether Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could be more constructive, but he said it would be better \u201cif I did not intervene in British politics\u201d. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to talk about it with him over a drink or something.\u201d He added: \u201cNo matter what happens in the next few weeks the common travel area will be unaffected.\u201d \u201cThe customs union has been the cornerstone of our economy for decades now. \u201cWe cannot let anything develop that would dilute that in anyway.\u201d Varadkar also rejected Sinn Fein\u2019s call for preparations for a new referendum on a united Ireland if there was a no-deal Brexit. He said: \u201cI know some people feel Brexit has changed the rules of engagement and perhaps it has, but now is not the time for border polls. It only serves to sew divisions.\u201d Varadkar said that a no-deal Brexit is now a real and possible outcome. \u201cI explained to President Junker the assistance Ireland will require in the event of a no-deal Brexit, for his part he emphasised that the EU stands ready to assist.\u201d Nigel Farage has welcomed Business Minister Richard Harrington\u2019s suggestion that the ERG should join his new Brexit party. He told PA: \u201cOh, it seems like a jolly good idea to me, but, I don\u2019t think we have quite reached that point yet.\u201d Labour MP Caroline Flint, a former Europe minister who represents the Leave-backing constituency of Don Valley, said Labour MPs should be given a free vote on Brexit to avoid those backing a second referendum from deserting the party. But speaking to HuffPost\u2019s Commons People podcast she also conceded that some of her colleague appeared to determined to leave the party. She said: \u201cThe truth is, where are they going to stand? Because the likelihood is if they stand against Labour in our areas they will let a Tory in\u2026.I think some people are hellbent on going\u2026They won\u2019t win, but they\u2019ll be responsible for ensuring Tory governments.\u201d She was also scathing about a tweaked proposal by by Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin to prevent a no-deal Brexit. She said: \u201cAt its most worrying I think it is a Trojan horse [for a second referendum]\u201d By contrast former leadership contender Liz Kendall is backing the plan. ee it Owen Jones meets the naked anti-Brexit protester Victoria Bateman. More than a dozen ministers, including six from the cabinet, could quit by the end of the month if Theresa May refuses to extend the Brexit negotiating period, according to the former attorney general Dominic Grieve. The pro-Europe backbencher said that the next round of Brexit votes on 27 February would be a \u201chigh noon\u201d moment when resignations on this scale might bring down the government. In his an interview with Today, Grieve said the ERG \u201cseem to be completely cavalier about the risks that the country might run if we leave with no deal\u201d, something which he said the \u201coverwhelming\u201d majority of MPs were not prepared to accept. He said he understood a number of ministers had already told May that if she was unable to secure a withdrawal agreement which could command the support of the Commons, she should extend the two-year Article 50 negotiating period. If she refused, he said \u201ca dozen or even more\u201d ministers may resign, including \u201cup to half a dozen\u201d from the cabinet. Asked whether this could bring down the government, Grieve said: \u201cYes it could, and this isn\u2019t a desirable outcome. \u201cThe irony of all this is that most of us in the Conservative Party are sufficiently united to want to try to operate a coherent Government. But the truth is we\u2019re finding it harder and harder to do. \u201cIt starts to bring into question whether in fact the Government is able to operate in the national interest at all. Business minister Richard Harrington has repeatedly threatened to resign if a no-deal Brexit becomes official government policy. In an interview with Parliament\u2019s magazine the House he says he is still considering quitting, but now seems more determined to stay if only to try to fight off the threat from the ERG. He said: \u201cThe question for me is not whether I stay in the job or not, it is whether, given that I feel passionately about the interests of business and industry \u2013 which is what it says on my business card \u2013 where can I make the most influence?\u201d \u201cI would much rather act collectively with other like-minded ministers, not to force the government to do something that it doesn\u2019t want to do, but to show the leadership that the views they receive from the ERG are a minority view and they\u2019re not the majority of the Conservative party, let alone of parliament.\u201d \u201cIf we all resigned, what would then happen? If I were in the ERG, it would give me a lot of pleasure to see us resign. But we can\u2019t give in to a minority of a minority, which is what the ERG is. \u201cThe prime minister has done a pretty good job of standing up to the ERG until now, but they were drinking champagne to celebrate her losing her deal and I regard that as being treachery. \u201cI read that Nigel Farage is setting up a new party called Brexit and if I were them I\u2019d be looking at that, because that seems to reflect their views more than the Conservative party. In my view, they\u2019re not Conservatives. \u201cThere are people who are very solid and stringent in their views and if I were them I would be looking at a party that seems designed for them \u2013 Nigel Farage\u2019s party.\u201d Labour MP Hilary Benn, chair of the Brexit committee, appears to warming to the idea of a second referendum. \u201cIf parliament can\u2019t decide ... then I think you might end up having to go back to the British people,\u201d he told the Today programme. Benn said he would retable an amendment on indicative votes for a way out of the Brexit impasse,that would include another referendum. He said: \u201cI will bring back in a couple of weeks time my amendment on indicative votes to see \u2018OK we know what we don\u2019t like, we are not having no-deal, we are not having the prime minister\u2019s deal, here\u2019s a range of alternative options\u2019.\u201d On Thursday, Clive Lewis, a shadow Treasury minister, warned that backing a Tory Brexit could wipe out Labour. Asked about those comments, Benn said: \u201cIn the end I think we have to compromise. And I\u2019ve argued for membership of the EEA and a customs union. But if that is not possible, then in the end the only way in which the last decision could be changed is if the British people are asked to decide whether they like the deal that the prime minister has negotiated or they want to remain.\u201d On what parliament would do if MPs could not agree on a deal, Benn said: \u201cThe first thing we have to do is protect the national interest by preventing us leaving on the 29 March without a deal. So you would have to apply for an extension. I think the European Union would give us an extension.\u201d Here some reaction to Leadsom\u2019s interview and the government\u2019s mixed messages on a no-deal Brexit. In that Today interview Leadsom insisted that the government was determined to use the threat of a no-deal Brexit as the main threat in its negotiating strategy Asked whether the government wanted to keep no deal on the table, she said: \u201cOf course we are. Essentially that is what will happen if we don\u2019t vote for a deal.\u201d She added: \u201cThe government does not want no-deal. It is there because that is the legal default position. And any competent government must prepare for all eventualities.\u201d Earlier in the programme the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, warned that as many as six cabinet ministers could resign if the government failed to extend article 50. Leadsom said: \u201cResignations from government do happen. People have very strong heartfelt views about Brexit.\u201d She added: \u201cWhat the government is seeking to do is to sort out the arrangements on the backstop so that parliament can vote for the deal. That is the government\u2019s sole focus.\u201d She also defended the PM\u2019s absence from the Commons when the result of the vote was read out. \u201cThe prime minister just this week spent two hour and 18 minutes answering questions in the chamber. Since October she spent 39 hours in the chamber answering questions. She has shown such commitment to making herself available to the House.\u201d She added: \u201cThe vote yesterday didn\u2019t change anything. The government\u2019s position remains to resolve the issues of the backstop and then come back to parliament with a fresh meaningful vote. It is essential that we crack on with that work.\u201d On the ERG\u2019s failure to back the government, Leadsom said \u201cthey were concerned that in supporting the motion it might indicate that they supported taking no-deal off the table.\u201d She added: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t to say that they no longer support the prime minister\u2019s attempts to get the backstop renegotiated, which is the very clear vote that we had a couple of weeks ago. So the prime minister carries on. She will continue to seek those legally binding changes to the backstop that will enable parliament to support her deal. Yesterday was more of a hiccup than the disaster that is being reported.\u201d She also urged the EU to compromise on the backstop: If the EU were to bring on the one thing that they have said they are determined to avoid, that is the risk of the UK leaving the EU without a deal at the end of March and thereby having to have some kind of hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. So it simply would not make sense to precipitate such a conundrum when the option of a negotiated arrangement, where the UK could put in place alternative arrangements for the backstop, would be far preferable from everybody\u2019s point of view including from the perspective of the issue of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. But Leadsom conceded that the vote could harm negotiations with Brussels: The one problem with last night\u2019s vote is that it allows the EU to continue with this pretence that they don\u2019t know what we want. They do know what we want. It was quite clear from the vote two weeks ago that what parliament wants to see is the issues around the backstop resolved in a legally binding way. What last night\u2019s vote was quite clearly about was the Labour party playing politics, because they decided to vote against what was a very unharmful motion, merely setting out the prime minister needs more time to deal that the issues with the House raised two weeks ago. Greek foreign minister George Katrougalos told Today that Thursday\u2019s Commons vote was \u201cpart of the contradictory message that we are receiving as the 27 from the UK\u201d. Katrougalos said: \u201cIt complicates even further the situation. It\u2019s very, very difficult to be optimistic about Brexit under these circumstances. \u201cIt is not foreseeable (that there will be) any kind of reopening of negotiations, because it took us two and a half years to reach the agreement we have now. \u201cI cannot exclude a miracle. Miracles happen, but I cannot see what kind of miracle it is that could save the day.\u201d Katrougalos said that the backstop was \u201can essential part\u201d of the UK\u2019s withdrawal agreement. While a customs union arrangement could remove the need for a backstop, this had been rejected by the UK government, he said. \u201cThat was the problem of the negotiations, that the UK position was at the beginning not clear. It kept changing, it was very volatile,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end it does not work in favour of your positions. At the end what resulted was an agreement which was the only agreement possible under the circumstances, and it was mainly due to the problems you had in the UK to have a coherent negotiating position.\u201d Leadsom also stresses that leaving the EU with no deal is the \u201clegal default position\u201d if MPs fail to back the withdraw agreement. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom has been sent on to the Today programme to try to calm Tory nerves. The vote was \u201cmore of a hiccup than the disaster that is being reported\u201d. She also accused Labour of playing politics by voting against the government. More mixed messages on whether the government would allow the UK to crash out of the EU without a deal on 29 March. In the Commons on Thursday, the Brexit secretary Steve Barclay spread alarm among some Tory backbenchers by confirming this was the default option if MPs failed to back the withdrawal agreement. But overnight government minister Alistair Burt insisted that there would not be a no-deal Brexit. Responding to a claim from eurosceptic former Brexit secretary David Davis that the government was ready to take the UK out of the EU without an agreement, Burt said: \u201cNo. We won\u2019t. We are not leaving without a deal. If you want to leave, you\u2019d better agree one. In the next fortnight would help.\u201d Burt added: \u201cThere is a majority in the House to reject no deal. Let\u2019s Leave, with the Agreement, and the chance of a new relationship with the EU. Honours both Leavers and those who voted to Remain. Let\u2019s all make the compromise.\u201d Steve Baker, the deputy chairman of the European Research Group of Brexit-backing Tory MPs, Steve Baker, has downplayed the significance of Thursday\u2019s vote, PA reports. Speaking to the Today programme, he said: \u201cThis whole mess is a storm in a teacup. What we needed to achieve here was to send a signal that we are not going to be associated with taking no-deal off the table.\u201d He rejected suggestions that the ERG had undermined May\u2019s efforts to secure concessions from the EU by raising doubts in Brussels over whether she can deliver a Commons majority for a deal. \u201cWe cannot get ourselves into a position where we are associated with rejecting the UK leaving the EU without a Withdrawal Agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophic and foolish negotiating error and we cannot be associated with it.\u201d Baker said ERG members objected to May \u201creinterpreting\u201d last month\u2019s vote to replace the withdrawal agreement\u2019s backstop with alternative arrangements for keeping the Irish border open. He said: \u201cWe put an enormous amount of effort into uniting the party around the Malthouse Compromise, and then within a couple of days the prime minister was reinterpreting our vote. \u201cI\u2019m afraid people didn\u2019t want to be treated like that twice.\u201d Baker said: \u201cI really do rather object to being called \u2018hardline\u2019 when what we are doing is trying to deliver an exit with a deal which works for everybody, with a transition period. We are making enormous compromises to work across the party.\u201d Baker said that a deal which left the UK in a customs union with the EU would amount to \u201crepudiating\u201d the result of the 2016 referendum. On the issue of whether a majority of MPs oppose no-deal, he told Today: \u201cParliamentarians need to wake up to the reality of what they legislated for. Are they really saying to us now that they didn\u2019t understand Article 50 when they voted for the notification of withdrawal?\u201d Baker added: \u201cWere this deal to pass through Parliament with this backstop on Labour votes, the Government would subsequently collapse because the DUP would not be able to maintain confidence and supply. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely convinced our position is eminently reasonable and right.\u201d Thursday\u2019s vote has provoked more exasperation in Europe. Reuters has the latest example: Britain should decide what to do regarding its exit from the European Union as soon as possible, according to the French European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau. Speaking to RTL Radio she said: \u201cI am telling our British friends that it is about time to decide whether to leave on friendly terms or abruptly \u201cIt is a purely British choice. What we are saying is : hurry up!\u201d Welcome to a rarish Friday version of Politics Live after the government\u2019s latest Commons defeat on Brexit. We will have all the fallout from the vote, amid talk of defections from both main parties, and look for signals on what happens next. Andrew Sparrow is taking a well-earned rest after another marathon Brexit blog on Thursday. But here are his six things we\u2019ve learned from May\u2019s latest defeat. 1 May will find it much harder now to argue that she has got a Commons majority behind her Brexit strategy 2 The debate showed that MPs were only able to unite behind Brady because they could not agree what it meant 3 EU leaders, who were reluctant to offer much to the UK in backstop concessions, not knowing what would get through parliament, will now surely feel still less inclined to engage 4 New government evidence about how damaging a no-deal Brexit might be will have to be published soon 5 May\u2019s defeat raises questions about the competence of the government\u2019s management of parliamentary business 6 The votes suggest that the debate on Wednesday 27 February may end up being a decisive moment for Brexit A number of senior Tory, including government ministers, have expressed fury at the European Research Group for failing to back the government. The defence minister, Tobias Ellwood, described their actions as \u201cprovocative\u201d, accusing them of operating as a \u201cparty within a party\u201d. And the business minister, Richard Harrington, accused the ERG of \u201ctreachery\u201d and called on them to join former Ukip leader Nigel Farage\u2019s new Brext party. Jacob Rees-Mogg, head of the ERG, defended the group\u2019s decision to abstain on the vote. Speaking on BBC\u2019s Question Time he said: \u201cIt\u2019s untrue to say that the ERG is holding people to ransom. \u201cWe\u2019re sticking up for what people voted for. Fundamentally I believe you trust the people and deliver on referendum results.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Last year the nation set out to celebrate a bold, brave and pioneering generation; those who, in 1948, made the transatlantic journey aboard the Empire Windrush in search of a \u2018better\u2019 life. The Windrush generation, and the deportation scandal they were the victims of last year, is something that both myself and Angela Ferreira, the managing director of my production company Douglas Road Productions, feel strongly about. We are both of Caribbean origin, via the Midlands, and felt the sting of this injustice sharply. We began to talk about how we might address the situation through some kind of TV programme. At the time BBC Arts had been pitched similar ideas by Kwame Kwei Armah, who had recently taken over as Top Dude [Artistic Director] at the Young Vic theatre in London. They suggested we pool our resources and work together on a Windrush-related project, which sounded fantastic. Before the Young Vic, Kwame had been running a theatre in Baltimore and making great waves over there, producing, directing and writing challenging and exciting work for a delighted audience. I\u2019m a big fan, not only because he\u2019s good looking, articulate and suave and knows his onions, but also \u2013 when called upon, he can sing the pants off of Superstition by Stevie Wonder. Together, we set out to ask questions of those who made the long journey: why they came to Britain, what happened to them once they got here, and how they felt about their new home \u2013 an approach that felt particularly pertinent because the media has tended to focus only on the sensational aspects of the Windrush crisis.

      "bodyText": "An upcoming BBC children\u2019s sitcom that focuses on a British Chinese family has been marred by accusations of racism. A group representing British East Asians in the film and TV industry said it was indefensible that the show should have been developed and written with little input from writers and creatives from the community. The CBBC series Living With the Lams is about a family that runs a restaurant in Manchester and is still in development. Members of British East Asians Working in Theatre and Screen (Beats) have seen scripts that they say perpetuate racial stereotypes and contain a \u201clitany of orientalist cliches\u201d. More than 100 Beats members have signed an open letter to the BBC and the production company Twenty Twenty to complain that the enlisting of a Chinese writer as a cultural consultant had been insufficient. \u201cWe do not accept the use of cultural consultants as replacements for British East Asian writers in a show where the raison d\u2019etre pivots on the lives of a British Chinese family,\u201d the letter says. It says widespread concerns about the script were ignored or dismissed, and that established British East Asian writers were told they were too inexperienced to be involved in the show. Signatories to the letter include the actors David Yip and Jessica Henwick and the American playwright David Henry Hwang. A spokesperson for Beats said: \u201cWe felt we could take a risk where writers could not. We had nothing to lose and everything to gain in writing this.\u201d When Beats saw the scripts \u201cthat sealed it for us\u201d, the spokesperson said. \u201cThey were clearly the product of not using the right voices to make this show.\u201d The group was keen to stress that it did not want the show to be cancelled. It is calling for the BBC and Twenty Twenty to work with British East Asians in the industry to create \u201ca series that is truly progressive in its representation of British East Asian family life because it succeeds in humanising them\u201d. The spokesperson said: \u201cThe world needs to be exposed to a realistic, nuanced and normalised representation of British East Asian people growing up.\u201d A BBC spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re really proud of our track record in making diverse and culturally relevant output for our young audience. We believe they deserve the best, which is why we work hard to find the most talented writers and producers to create the most entertaining and engaging shows. \u201cWe always seek guidance, advice and expert input for culturally sensitive content. We\u2019re still in the development stages of Living With the Lams and so the editorial process is ongoing. We do not appoint comedy writers or producers based solely on their cultural affiliations or nationality, but we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll create a show that successfully reflects and celebrates this community.\u201d",

However, while these sweet Tokajis still make wine geeks go weak at the knees, these days it is the dry styles made from furmint that are setting pulses racing.</p> <p>After decades in the Soviet-controlled doldrums, the Hungarian wine industry is finding its feet once again. Young and energetic winemakers are looking to lighter and fresher styles more fitting to modern palates than the traditional powerful reds and heavily oaked whites made by previous generations. Dry furmints are a prime example of this.</p> <p>What appeals about them is their characteristic streak of appetising acidity, along with a certain seductive smokiness that comes from Tokaj\u2019s volcanic soils. Some have lip-smacking, lemony freshness, others more rounded, quince-like fruit, and aromatics that remind me sometimes of warm apricot jam, sometimes of racy spearmint.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May will face a wall of resistance when she returns to Brussels next week as the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, declared her Brexit strategy had \u201cfailed\u201d after another parliamentary defeat inflicted by hardline Eurosceptics. May will insist to EU chiefs that her defeat in parliament on Thursday does not change her belief that her Brexit deal can still achieve a majority \u2013 as long as there are changes to the backstop. The mood hardened in Brussels on Friday amid doubts that the prime minister could ever forge any consensus in her warring party, with Barnier telling diplomats from member states that her strategy could not work. One EU ambassador has suggested the risk of a no-deal Brexit was as high as 90% given the prime minister\u2019s intransigence. The defeat in parliament came at the hands of the European Research Group, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, who abstained on a government motion because it appeared to rule out a no-deal Brexit. May, who will visit Brussels on Wednesday, is expected to insist that the group could still fall in line as long as necessary changes to the backstop are secured, pointing to the vote a fortnight ago on an amendment spelling out that \u201calternative arrangements\u201d must be made. However, Barnier told ambassadors May needed to now work cross-party to build support for the withdrawal agreement but had instead \u201cwidened rather than narrowed\u201d the divide with the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, in her response to his recent offer of support. He told diplomats that he \u201cdoes not expect a solution this week\u201d. \u201cThe vote yesterday indicated there is no majority in the Tory party for the withdrawal agreement,\u201d one diplomat said after Barnier\u2019s address. \u201cHe said \u2018strategy May has failed\u2019 and that she needs to go cross-party.\u201d A number of ambassadors echoed Barnier\u2019s reading. \u201cWe have a major problem,\u201d one told the meeting. Barnier, who will meet Corbyn on Thursday, also told diplomats that during a dinner with Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, on Monday, the British cabinet minister had pressed the need for a legal guarantee of being able to exit the backstop or a time-limit on the customs union it envisages. The EU official told the ambassadors that it appeared crucial to the government to be able to change the legal advice given by the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox. Cox is due to go to Brussels with Barclay on Monday. Sources in London suggested the prime minister had hoped that other EU leaders would be more understanding of the kind of parliamentary game-playing seen on Thursday than officials in Brussels. \u201cThey are all politicians,\u201d said a government source. Privately, Downing Street is exasperated by what it regards as self-interested posturing by some MPs. Sources described the prime minister as furious in the voting lobbies on Wednesday night. On Friday, May\u2019s spokeswoman said the previous vote in January, where MPs passed an amendment demanding the backstop be replaced with alternative arrangements and rejected the possibility of no deal, was the only one that had spelled out what parliament would accept. \u201cThe motion on 29 January remains the only one the Commons has passed expressing what it does want, and that is what we are pursuing,\u201d the spokeswoman said. Anger at the ERG\u2019s antics was explicit from soft Brexit ministers in the aftermath of the defeat. The defence minister Tobias Ellwood called the group\u2019s actions \u201cselfish and provocative\u201d and said they were acting as a \u201cparty within a party\u201d. Alistair Burt, the Foreign Office minister, gave his strongest signal yet he was prepared to resign unless the government allowed him to back efforts to stop no deal by the next vote at the end of February. \u201cIf my colleagues cannot accept a necessary compromise, or if government does not itself move to prevent no deal, then I expect parliament to do so, as such moves would certainly pass a commons vote,\u201d he said. \u201cI will continue to act consistently with the views I have regularly set out.\u201d Senior Labour figures, including Keir Starmer and Jon Trickett, are to hold a fresh round of meetings with their government counterparts next week over whether a cross-party consensus can be found. One person present at the last meeting said Barclay and May\u2019s de facto deputy, David Lidington, appeared serious about looking for common ground \u2013 but that little progress was likely to be made until May is willing to lift her objection to a customs union.",

Value of club \u00a3548m, 15th in Forbes: The Business of Soccer (see note on sourcing) Turnover \u00a3210m, 16th in Deloitte Football Money League 2017/18 (see note on sourcing) Net profit/loss -\u00a39.5m loss (2017) Partners: The Russian government at one remove. Gas company Gazprom, majority owned by the Russian government, became the club\u2019s shirt sponsor in 2007 in a deal negotiated by Clemens T\u00f6nnies, the billionaire club president with close ties to Russia, through his meat business. Gazprom press officer Sergey Kupriyanov sits on the club\u2019s board. In 2011 Vladimir Putin tried to intervene against the sale of Manuel Neuer to Bayern Munich. Fans protested against the club\u2019s visit to the Kremlin. Manchester City Owned by Abu Dhabi United Group Investment and Development. Value of club \u00a31.9bn (5th) Turnover \u00a3503.5m (5th) Net profit/loss \u00a310.4m profit (2017-18) Partners: All things Abu Dhabi, including their shirt and stadium sponsor Etihad Airways, plus tourism organisation Visit Abu Dhabi. The city is the capital of the United Arab Emirates, which is taking part in the Saudi-led military action in Yemen, where thousands of civilians have been killed. The country has also faced criticism over multiple human rights and civil liberties issues. The club has refused to give Uefa answers on new questions, based on documents exposed by Der Spiegel magazine, relating to whether it has breached financial fair play regulations relating to transfers and the true market value of Abu Dhabi sponsorship deals, a key component of the club\u2019s \u00a3218m in commercial revenue. Hedge Fund v Third Party Player Ownership Roma Owned by an investment vehicle controlled by the American hedge fund billionaire James Pallotta, which owns 60% of the club. Pallotta is the founder of the Raptor Group, a private investment company. Value of club \u00a3479m (16th) Turnover \u00a3219m (15th) Net profit/loss -\u00a322.3m loss (2017-18) Partners: Qatar Airways is main sponsor. The airline is owned by the Gulf state, which has been subject to criticism over high volumes of deaths among workers building infrastructure for the 2022 World Cup. Last year Pallotta rebuffed inquiries about a takeover from Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. Porto Owned by several large individual minority shareholders. Is listed on the Lisbon stock exchange. Value of club Not listed in Forbes: The Business of Soccer Turnover \u00a393m, outside top 30 in Deloitte Football Money League Net profit/loss -\u00a324.9m loss (2017-18) Methods: A brilliantly-geared machine, taking advantage of the fact third-party ownership is legal in Portugal to source and sell on talent at a huge profit. The club made an estimated \u20ac410m in transfer fees in the 15 years to 2017. The relationship with super-agent Jorge Mendes has raised concerns. State of Qatar v Football Club As Cash Machine Paris Saint-Germain Owned by Qatar Sports Investments, an arm of the Qatar government. PSG act as the leading international face of Qatar\u2019s sports operation, chaired by Nasser al-Khelaifi. Value of club \u00a3753m (11th) Turnover \u00a3475m, (6th) Net profit/loss \u00a327.6m profit (2017-18) Partners: Qatar. A Qatari bank, a Qatari telecoms group, Qatari sports TV. Also, in a deal that predated the Qatari takeover, Emirates airline. Thereby making PSG\u2019s shirts one place where the two opposing gulf blockade foes can live in self-promoting peace. Involvement in the world\u2019s favourite sport helps burnish the Qatar\u2019s public image amid accusations of exploitation of migrant workers. Fifa has also been urged to put pressure on Qatar over its stance on homosexuality, which is illegal in the country. PSG is a vehicle for promoting the state of Qatar at the centre of European football, thereby helping to build the new leisure economy. Vast player expenditure has inflated the European market. Currently being investigated for alleged irregularities around the deals that brought Neymar and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 to Paris, which are denied by PSG, centring on the income it derived from a sponsorship deal with the Qatar Tourism Authority. Manchester United Owned by the Glazer family, via family trusts that hold ownership of the majority of the club. The PLC is registered in the Cayman Islands tax haven. Value of club \u00a33.2bn (1st) Turnover \u00a3590m (3rd) Net profit/loss -\u00a337.3m loss (2018) Partners: Talk of a Saudi takeover turned out to be Twitter nonsense. But United do have a strategic partnership with Saudi Arabia\u2019s General Sports Authority \u201cto create a sustainable and thriving football sector\u201d. Human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia are well-documented and have been thrown into sharper relief by the Jamal Khashoggi affair. It has a vast number of official club sponsors, including Aeroflot, which is 51% owned by the Russian state. The Glazers have taken about \u00a31bn out of the club, while also delivering record commercial turnover. This is hard capitalism in action: the Glazers bought the club in the same way you might buy a buy-to-let flat, borrowing against its value and funding repayments with its income. Bahamas Tax Haven v Holier-Than-Thou European Rectitude Tottenham Hotspur Owned by Bahamas-registered Enic International Limited owns 85.55%. Joe Lewis owns 70.6% of Enic. The Levy family own the rest. Lewis is the 32nd wealthiest UK citizen according to the Sunday Times Rich List and a tax exile in the Bahamas. Lewis\u2019s first fortune came from the UK leaving the European exchange rate mechanism, which saw Lewis bet heavily against the pound in partnership with speculators including George Soros. Value of club \u00a3960m (10th) Revenue \u00a3379.4m (10th) Net profit/loss \u00a341.2m profit (2017) Partners: Three official betting partners, including main sponsor AIA Group, an insurance giant listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Borussia Dortmund Owned by assorted German companies, the largest Evonik Industries AG at 14.78%. Plus 59.94% free float on the stock exchange. Value of club \u00a3698m (12th) Turnover \u00a3278m (12th) Net profit/loss \u00a325m profit (2017-18) Partners: See themselves as a beacon of sporting morality. A while back Dortmund announced they had \u201crejected several requests for friendlies from countries in which the human rights situation does not align with Borussia Dortmund\u2019s standards\u201d. When Liverpool beat Manchester City the day before Dortmund\u2019s AGM last year, the club\u2019s chairman thanked J\u00fcrgen Klopp \u201cfor continuing the fight of the classic working man\u2019s club against the sheikhs\u201d. Despite all that, Dortmund have just launched a new Chinese office, toured China and have a Chinese website. China\u2019s one-party authoritarian regime has been tightening its grip on its own people recently, quashing political opposition and dissent. Steamrollering Global Brand v Socio PLC Real Madrid Owned by its members. Value of club \u00a33.2bn (2nd) Turnover \u00a3658m (1st) Net profit/loss \u00a327m profit (2017-18) Partners: Dubai-based airline Emirates is the club\u2019s main sponsor. \u201cBoth Real Madrid and Emirates use the power of sport as a vehicle to create moments of inspiration,\u201d they say. The club has an agreement with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Prince Salman Foundation to build a sports academy in the kingdom, allying it with the crown prince whose reputation as a moderniser has been tarnished since the Jamal Khashoggi murder. They also have a US$1bn branded resort in Ras al-Khaimah in the UAE, Saudi\u2019s partner in the conflict in Yemen, as well as football academies in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and a football foundation campus in Qatar. Until it was ruled illegal by the EU in 2016, Real and Barcelona received tax breaks from the state due to their \u201cethnic importance\u201d. Ajax Owned by a public company listed on the stock exchange. 73% of the shares are held by Vereniging AFC Ajax, an organisation owned by club members. Also 5% owned by Invesco, an American investment company. Value of club Not listed in Forbes Business of Soccer Turnover \u00a381m, outside top 30 in Deloitte Football Money League Net profit/loss \u00a31.2m profit (2018) Partners: Have a five-year multimillion-euro partnership with Chinese Super League side Guangzhou R&amp;F to help develop their academy. Hedge Fund v Friends of Qatar Liverpool Owned by Fenway Sports Group, 60% of which is owned by John W Henry, a hedge fund billionaire and former commodities trader. Value of club \u00a31.5bn (8th) Turnover \u00a3455m (7th) Net profit/loss \u00a3106m profit, a world record (2017-18) Partners: Style is a great socialist club owned by a US hedge fund. Main sponsor is Standard Chartered Bank. Also sponsored by Malaysia Airlines, national airline of Malaysia, as well as BetVictor. Bayern Munich Owned by 75% by members/fans, who control the club, with Adidas, Audi and Allianz owning stakes. Value of club \u00a32.3bn (4th) Turnover \u00a3551m (4th) Net profit/loss \u00a325.8m profit (2017-18) Partners: Sponsored by Qatar Airways as of last year. Ties with Qatar caused a flashpoint before the winter break tour there. Fans held banners that read \u201cMoney over human rights\u201d and \u201cOpen your eyes when it comes to sponsor choice\u201d. Club has also signed a sponsorship deal with Doha airport. Also runs an FC Bayern company in China. M\u00e9s Que Un Club v Charismatic Businessman/Chinese Fund Barcelona Owned by its members. Value of club \u00a33.1bn (3rd) Turnover \u00a3605m (2nd) Net profit/loss \u00a311.4m profit (2017-18) Partners: As Barcelona president Sandro Rosell famously criticised the ownership of major Premier League clubs, saying Barcelona, will \u201cnever, ever be for sale\u201d. But the shirts had been sold, to the Qatar Foundation, which paid \u00a3160m over five years for a main sponsor deal. Rosell\u2019s successor, Josep Maria Bartomeu, made a big play of breaking off that relationship. Barcelona have since signed up with Dubai-run Emirates NBD as shirt sponsors. Have become a massive global brand, selling everything from shirt space to Bar\u00e7a wine, Bar\u00e7a financial products and Bar\u00e7a academies across the world. This expansionism can lead to the odd false note. Bar\u00e7a totem Lionel Messi was criticised by the Human Rights Foundation for his trip to Gabon and \u201centhusiastic support\u201d for the much vilified dictator Ali Bongo. Lyon Owned by Jean-Michel Aulas, an outspoken, long-standing, enduringly popular figure. Also 20% owned by a Chinese private equity fund. Value of club Not listed in Forbes: The Business of Soccer Turnover \u00a3144m (28th) Net profit/loss \u00a37m profit (2017-18) Partners: Has a Chinese academy partner, the Chengdu FA. Main sponsor is Hyundai, the South Korean car giant. Friends of Azerbaijan v Agnelli Business Empire Atl\u00e9tico Madrid Owned by Miguel \u00c1ngel Gil Mar\u00edn and Enrique Cerezo are majority shareholders. The Chinese tycoon Wang Jianlin sold his 17% stake to an Israeli-owned investment company last year. Value of club \u00a3657m (13th) Turnover \u00a3267m (13th) Net profit/loss \u00a34.4m profit (2016-17) Partners: Sponsored by Azerbaijan for several years, the slogan \u201cLand of Fire\u201d appearing on the players\u2019 shirts, promoting a country that has been criticised for political repression. Also maintains its Chinese connections via two commercial offices. Juventus Owned by The Agnelli family, the Italian business dynasty behind carmaker Fiat and, by extension, Ferrari. Value of club \u00a31.1bn (9th) Turnover \u00a3346m (11th) Net profit/loss \u00a338m (2016-17) Partners: Impressively large spread of companies including Betfair, whose parent company was fined last year for accepting bets funded by stolen money. Juventus are pressing on with a heavily resourced expansion into China, where they have multiple commercial partners, and recently travelled to Saudi Arabia to play the Super Coppa Italia despite protests about selling the domestic game and condoning human rights abuses. Sourcing &amp; methodology Club values and revenue figures have been taken from Forbes: The Business of Soccer and Deloitte Football Money League. Where a club does not feature in either report, this is stated. Net profit figures have been taken from clubs\u2019 financial accounts or other regulated financial statements. Revenue figures from Deloitte may differ from revenue figures given in club accounts because Deloitte uses a standardised methodology to even up differences in the way that clubs across Europe report their revenues. Revenue figures do not include income from player sales. Some figures have been changed from dollars or euros to pounds, using an exchange rate on 11 February 2019.",

Right now an updated version of Danny Blanchflower\u2019s famous quote would point out something else: that the game is also about politics and placement, about soft power, about presenting a face to the world.</p> \n<p>As the Champions League knockout stage kicks in, this element of Big Football is primed once again to take the main stage, the executive arm of a sport that has never looked so tangled.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/15/gazprom-abu-dhabi-alternative-guide-champions-league-ties-last-16\">Gazprom v Abu Dhabi: an alternative guide to the Champions League ties</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Here\u2019s an interesting circular equation. Manchester United are currently playing Paris Saint-Germain over two legs in the Champions League. Paris Saint-Germain are owned by Qatar. Qatar also sponsors Bayern Munich and Roma and has a <a href=\"http://frmcampqatar.com/\">\u201cfoundation\u201d project with Real Madrid</a>.</p> \n<p>Real Madrid are sponsored by the Emirates airline of the UAE. Another of the emirates, Abu Dhabi, owns Manchester City. Manchester City are taking on Schalke, who are sponsored by Gazprom, <a href=\"http://www.gazprom.com/investors/stock/\">which is owned by Russia</a>, which is <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Syrian-Civil-War\">in effect at war in Syria with Qatar</a>, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/21/qatar-crisis-may-be-rooted-in-old-family-rivalries\">being blockaded by Dubai</a>, which is <a href=\"https://www.manutd.com/en/partners/financial/emirates-nbd\">a financial services partner</a> of Manchester United, whose next opponents will be Paris Saint-Germain, who are owned by Qatar. Which is pretty much where we came in.</p> \n<p>Confusing, isn\u2019t it? If only there were a single figure who could stand above and wade through this confusion of interests. For example, <a href=\"https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/about-uefa/executive-committee/news/newsid=2590558.html\">Nasser al-Khelaifi, the newest member of Uefa\u2019s executive committee</a>.</p> \n<p>Khelaifi is <a href=\"https://www.beinmediagroup.com/the-group/nasser-al-khelaifi/\">also chairman of BeIn sports</a>, which <a href=\"https://www.beinsports.com/en/uefa-champions-league/\">pays Uefa for its Champions League TV rights</a>.

Uefa <a href=\"https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/about-uefa/administration/marketing/news/newsid=2560120.html\">is also sponsored by Adidas</a>, which owns <a href=\"https://fcbayern.com/en/club/company/teaser-stockholder\">a stake in Bayern Munich</a>.

Sport has been bought, sold, fluffed, preened, primped and generally co-opted by those in power ever since it first appeared as a public spectacle. Show me a morally pure professional sport; I\u2019ll show you a professional sport that\u2019s clearly not doing it right.</p> \n<p>It took just four years for Fifa\u2019s World Cup to experience its first mugging by the tyrannical classes. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2018/jun/28/corruption-and-fascism-when-politics-and-the-world-cup-collide-video-explainer\">Italy\u2019s 1934 tournament was fascism\u2019s great global coming out party</a>, designed and staged by Benito Mussolini\u2019s chief spin doctor, Achille Starace, also credited as the inventor of the straight-arm salute.</p> \n<p>Like it or not this has been the way of things to varying degrees ever since. Coercive interests are everywhere, from the barrage of commercial club football sponsors, to the GB-branded triumphalism of London 2012, to the wonderfully clean and orderly Russia 2018 World Cup, a masterly PR exercise for the Putin regime.</p> \n<p>What is new is that this process that takes place in ever-more complex and invasive ways. The phrase \u201csportswashing\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/10/manchester-city-amnesty-international-football-leaks\">first cropped up in these pages in December last year</a> in a quote from Amnesty International on the ownership of Manchester City</p> \n<p>It is a useful coinage, capturing something deliberate and systemic, a macro-level manipulation of sport\u2019s status as the great shared global spectacle. Sportswashing describes the way sport is used to launder a reputation, to gloss a human rights record, to wash a little blood away.</p> \n<p>The phrase itself involves a value judgment. It stems from a belief in moral absolutes, the idea we can say with certainty a particular ideology or regime should not be \u201cnormalised\u201d by close association with sport.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"43d726c0-1fd6-4ff7-b700-12c5c5528b71\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Russia&nbsp;<br></b>Peaceful protest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/google-pulls-youtube-ad-by-putin-critic-alexei-navalny\">heavily restricted</a>.

If an oil-rich state wants to buy instant access to the global leisure economy, then good luck to it. If the owner of Chelsea FC foresees the excellent reputational benefits of becoming a part of the west London celebrity furniture, then just take the cash. Let he who is without a lucrative Saudi arms deal cast the first stone.</p> \n<p>Plus, ambitious carbon-powers aren\u2019t the only problematic ownership model. No doubt some would also identify hedge funds as immoral, extreme speculative capitalism that produces nothing but its own wealth, which has no function beyond making the rich into the super-rich. US hedge funds have often used sport to present a softer face to the world: <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolfc.com/corporate/directors\">Liverpool</a> and <a href=\"https://www.asroma.com/en/club/directors\">Roma</a> are among the Champions League last 16 owned by friendly US capitalists.</p> \n<p>It is a vantage point that tends to spin the moral compass around in circles. How can we object to Arsenal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/29/rwandas-30m-arsenal-sponsorship-divides-opinion\">taking money</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/07/15/many-africans-see-kagames-rwanda-as-a-model-they-are-wrong\">oppressive regime of Rwanda</a> and not object to <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/arsenal-stan-kroenke-donated-1billion-donald-trump-a7691536.html\">Stan Kroenke donating $1m</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/trump-human-rights-autopsy-report\">oppressive regime of Donald Trump</a>?

There is a reason global sport seems so baroque and impossibly complicated: because it\u2019s baroque and impossibly complicated.</p> \n<p>This is the real point here. It was the reaction to Amnesty\u2019s sportswashing talk last December, at a time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/27/matthew-hedges-jailed-academic-returns-to-uk-after-uae-pardon\">when Abu Dhabi was under scrutiny for its treatment of Matthew Hedges</a>, a British academic convicted of spying, that highlighted how impossibly contorted this process has become.</p> \n<p>In the melee of shouted argument that followed, Manchester City became an unlikely muster point for discussions of the Emirati justice system. Some fans took to the digital airwaves to \u201cback their man\u201d, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/nov/24/manchester-city-fans-defence-uae-sportswashing-tribal-loyalty\">rubbish concern at this incident as evidence of football-based bias</a>.</p> \n<p>At first it seemed absurd, a mass willingness to follow the sportswashing tide. After a while it felt more like a case of being boxed in by other, larger absurdities. What is the correct response to all this anyway?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As ever, informed judgment is the key. As Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK\u2019s director, told the Guardian: \u201cWe\u2019re not saying who should and shouldn\u2019t be buying into European football, but we want all clubs to understand that their overseas owners may be using the prestige of elite football to effectively \u2018rebrand\u2019 themselves.</p> \n<p>\u201cInstead of actually tackling abuse, many countries with atrocious human rights records have a habit of enlisting expensive PR firms \u2013 and football ownership can be another form of PR. \u2018Sportswashing\u2019 is likely to grow as the reach of global sport also grows, but at the same time fans and the wider public are beginning to look beyond the glamour of the star players and the bulging trophy cabinets.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe would also call on clubs \u2013 the coaches, players, and backroom staff \u2013 to use their considerable influence to press for greater recognition of human rights.\u201d</p> \n<p>This does happen elsewhere. In Germany fans have protested against undue influences. Bayern have been <a href=\"http://www.arabnews.com/node/1293191/sport\">censured by their supporters for cosying up to Qatar</a>. Schalke fans <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/chelsea-vs-schalke-controversial-gazprom-deals-cast-cloud-ahead-of-champions-league-game-9736801.html\">have scrutinised the relationship with Gazprom</a>. Ownership rules are enforced (for now) to prevent the majority buyout of what are still, on some level, community clubs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f15a99462200c9fa19b341474f0ee928eef509f9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f15a99462200c9fa19b341474f0ee928eef509f9/0_92_3386_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Schalke fans have scrutinised the club\u2019s relationship with Gazprom and Bayern have been censured by their supporters for cosying up to Qatar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"726\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Schalke fans have scrutinised the club\u2019s relationship with Gazprom and Bayern have been censured by their supporters for cosying up to Qatar.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Dalder/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Not so in England, one-stop launderette and fawning friend to the super-rich. Here the only protest against the ownership of any of the bigger clubs is probably the early anti-Glazer movement at Manchester United, or the rumblings against Kroenke at Arsenal, both of which were essentially protests against a lack of success on the pitch.</p> \n<p>Plus of course it would be myopic to pretend the UK is above all this. It is an English vice in particular to see only the failings of others, to address the rest of the world from a position of bogus moral superiority. In reality <a href=\"https://www.theweek.co.uk/checked-out/86700/the-truth-about-uk-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia\">the UK was the sixth-biggest arms dealer in the world in 2017</a> , and the second-largest exporter of arms to Saudi Arabia. It\u2019s likely British weapons have been used to <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/exposed-british-made-bombs-used-civilian-targets-yemen\">violate international law in combat missions in Yemen</a>. British arms are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/28/uk-weapons-sold-countries-poor-human-rights-saudi-arabia\">also sold to other countries with dubious human rights records</a>, including Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Venezuela and China. Immigration and deportation policies under the current government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/07/windrush-legal-illegal-migrants-caribbean-deportation-uk\">have been censured</a>. There is more than enough dirt close to home.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>This is an entirely new thing that at times seems to be playing us all like a concert orchestra of violins</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>All of which raises another point. How well are the media doing in reporting of this? How should they police themselves? Again, what is the morally correct response? We are of course all complicit here too. If sportswashing is taking place it is newspapers and websites and TV channels that propagate it, that dutifully reproduce the images and style the narrative.</p> \n<p>In the media\u2019s defence \u2013 and indeed in everyone\u2019s defence - this is an entirely new thing, a process that has crept in from the fringes, and that at times seems to be playing us all like a concert orchestra of violins.</p> \n<p>What is required in response is a new kind of critical eye.

      "bodyText": "The game is about glory, a wise man once said. For many years it has been about money, too. Right now an updated version of Danny Blanchflower\u2019s famous quote would point out something else: that the game is also about politics and placement, about soft power, about presenting a face to the world. As the Champions League knockout stage kicks in, this element of Big Football is primed once again to take the main stage, the executive arm of a sport that has never looked so tangled. Here\u2019s an interesting circular equation. Manchester United are currently playing Paris Saint-Germain over two legs in the Champions League. Paris Saint-Germain are owned by Qatar. Qatar also sponsors Bayern Munich and Roma and has a \u201cfoundation\u201d project with Real Madrid. Real Madrid are sponsored by the Emirates airline of the UAE. Another of the emirates, Abu Dhabi, owns Manchester City. Manchester City are taking on Schalke, who are sponsored by Gazprom, which is owned by Russia, which is in effect at war in Syria with Qatar, which is being blockaded by Dubai, which is a financial services partner of Manchester United, whose next opponents will be Paris Saint-Germain, who are owned by Qatar. Which is pretty much where we came in. Confusing, isn\u2019t it? If only there were a single figure who could stand above and wade through this confusion of interests. For example, Nasser al-Khelaifi, the newest member of Uefa\u2019s executive committee. Khelaifi is also chairman of BeIn sports, which pays Uefa for its Champions League TV rights. Uefa is investigating claims of financial fair play breaches by PSG. Where he is \u2013 do keep up \u2013 the club chairman. Another circle of life, another wheel within football\u2019s wheels. It should be pointed out this isn\u2019t just a Gulf state thing. Uefa is also sponsored by Adidas, which owns a stake in Bayern Munich. Plus of course there is also a discrete PR mini-industry dedicated to discrediting Qatar, with the distant goal of trying to scotch the 2022 World Cup: an example of anti-sportswashing against which every drip of negative coverage should be tested. This is nothing new in itself. Sport has been bought, sold, fluffed, preened, primped and generally co-opted by those in power ever since it first appeared as a public spectacle. Show me a morally pure professional sport; I\u2019ll show you a professional sport that\u2019s clearly not doing it right. It took just four years for Fifa\u2019s World Cup to experience its first mugging by the tyrannical classes. Italy\u2019s 1934 tournament was fascism\u2019s great global coming out party, designed and staged by Benito Mussolini\u2019s chief spin doctor, Achille Starace, also credited as the inventor of the straight-arm salute. Like it or not this has been the way of things to varying degrees ever since. Coercive interests are everywhere, from the barrage of commercial club football sponsors, to the GB-branded triumphalism of London 2012, to the wonderfully clean and orderly Russia 2018 World Cup, a masterly PR exercise for the Putin regime. What is new is that this process that takes place in ever-more complex and invasive ways. The phrase \u201csportswashing\u201d first cropped up in these pages in December last year in a quote from Amnesty International on the ownership of Manchester City It is a useful coinage, capturing something deliberate and systemic, a macro-level manipulation of sport\u2019s status as the great shared global spectacle. Sportswashing describes the way sport is used to launder a reputation, to gloss a human rights record, to wash a little blood away. The phrase itself involves a value judgment. It stems from a belief in moral absolutes, the idea we can say with certainty a particular ideology or regime should not be \u201cnormalised\u201d by close association with sport. Some might argue otherwise. If an oil-rich state wants to buy instant access to the global leisure economy, then good luck to it. If the owner of Chelsea FC foresees the excellent reputational benefits of becoming a part of the west London celebrity furniture, then just take the cash. Let he who is without a lucrative Saudi arms deal cast the first stone. Plus, ambitious carbon-powers aren\u2019t the only problematic ownership model. No doubt some would also identify hedge funds as immoral, extreme speculative capitalism that produces nothing but its own wealth, which has no function beyond making the rich into the super-rich. US hedge funds have often used sport to present a softer face to the world: Liverpool and Roma are among the Champions League last 16 owned by friendly US capitalists. It is a vantage point that tends to spin the moral compass around in circles. How can we object to Arsenal taking money from the oppressive regime of Rwanda and not object to Stan Kroenke donating $1m to the oppressive regime of Donald Trump? If it\u2019s wrong for Manchester City to endorse the United Arab Emirates, how can it be fine to travel there on holiday, or go there to cover a cricket tour or drive in an F1 race? And so we reach a stalemate where no objection is free from whataboutery, where no judgment holds up to scrutiny. There is a reason global sport seems so baroque and impossibly complicated: because it\u2019s baroque and impossibly complicated. This is the real point here. It was the reaction to Amnesty\u2019s sportswashing talk last December, at a time when Abu Dhabi was under scrutiny for its treatment of Matthew Hedges, a British academic convicted of spying, that highlighted how impossibly contorted this process has become. In the melee of shouted argument that followed, Manchester City became an unlikely muster point for discussions of the Emirati justice system. Some fans took to the digital airwaves to \u201cback their man\u201d, to rubbish concern at this incident as evidence of football-based bias. At first it seemed absurd, a mass willingness to follow the sportswashing tide. After a while it felt more like a case of being boxed in by other, larger absurdities. What is the correct response to all this anyway? As ever, informed judgment is the key. As Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK\u2019s director, told the Guardian: \u201cWe\u2019re not saying who should and shouldn\u2019t be buying into European football, but we want all clubs to understand that their overseas owners may be using the prestige of elite football to effectively \u2018rebrand\u2019 themselves. \u201cInstead of actually tackling abuse, many countries with atrocious human rights records have a habit of enlisting expensive PR firms \u2013 and football ownership can be another form of PR. \u2018Sportswashing\u2019 is likely to grow as the reach of global sport also grows, but at the same time fans and the wider public are beginning to look beyond the glamour of the star players and the bulging trophy cabinets. \u201cWe would also call on clubs \u2013 the coaches, players, and backroom staff \u2013 to use their considerable influence to press for greater recognition of human rights.\u201d This does happen elsewhere. In Germany fans have protested against undue influences. Bayern have been censured by their supporters for cosying up to Qatar. Schalke fans have scrutinised the relationship with Gazprom. Ownership rules are enforced (for now) to prevent the majority buyout of what are still, on some level, community clubs. Not so in England, one-stop launderette and fawning friend to the super-rich. Here the only protest against the ownership of any of the bigger clubs is probably the early anti-Glazer movement at Manchester United, or the rumblings against Kroenke at Arsenal, both of which were essentially protests against a lack of success on the pitch. Plus of course it would be myopic to pretend the UK is above all this. It is an English vice in particular to see only the failings of others, to address the rest of the world from a position of bogus moral superiority. In reality the UK was the sixth-biggest arms dealer in the world in 2017 , and the second-largest exporter of arms to Saudi Arabia. It\u2019s likely British weapons have been used to violate international law in combat missions in Yemen. British arms are also sold to other countries with dubious human rights records, including Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Venezuela and China. Immigration and deportation policies under the current government have been censured. There is more than enough dirt close to home. All of which raises another point. How well are the media doing in reporting of this? How should they police themselves? Again, what is the morally correct response? We are of course all complicit here too. If sportswashing is taking place it is newspapers and websites and TV channels that propagate it, that dutifully reproduce the images and style the narrative. In the media\u2019s defence \u2013 and indeed in everyone\u2019s defence - this is an entirely new thing, a process that has crept in from the fringes, and that at times seems to be playing us all like a concert orchestra of violins. What is required in response is a new kind of critical eye. Or at the very least wider circulation of the basic information, the forensic tools with which to make a judgment. With this in mind, the Guardian has tried to kickstart a little debate by looking at the Champions League last 16 through this lens, laying out on the same page for the first time the tangle of owners, sponsors and interests. To give an overview, we enlisted the help of Amnesty International. We also asked our overseas contributors for their input to those clubs in their region.

The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence.

Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory.

But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades.

Latinos are only 13% of Prep users while 73% of Prep users are white. \u201cWhatever strategy the Trump administration comes up with, it\u2019s going to have to grapple with who in fact is disproportionately impacted by HIV/Aids: it\u2019s brown and black, it\u2019s disadvantaged,\u201d said Guilamo-Ramos, who directs the Center for Latino Adolescent and Family Health (CLAFH) at NYU\u2019s Silver School of Social Work. These new HIV diagnoses among Latinos were concentrated primarily in Florida, Texas, California, Arizona, Illinois and Puerto Rico, according to the CDC. They were also concentrated in the Bronx \u2013 even though young Latinos there do not show any less safe sexual behaviors than their non-Latino peers. Compared to national averages, Bronx youngsters are less sexually active, have had fewer lifetime sexual partners and are more likely to have been tested for HIV, according to the CDC. But compared with the four other New York City boroughs, the Bronx has the worst poverty, housing instability, life expectancy and exposure to community violence. Guilamo-Ramos said it was as if there were two pools filled with sharks \u2013 one with many more sharks than the other. In one pool, a person who swims across is less likely to get bitten, and if they do get bitten there is much more of a response from the community. In the other pool, not only is there a greater chance of someone being bitten by a shark, they also linger in the pool longer waiting for help. Guilamo-Ramos is developing programs that show getting the community involved can go a long way towards helping people swimming in the shark-infested pool. He has developed two programs for high-risk communities in the Bronx, Families Talking Together (FTT) and Fathers Raising Responsible Men (FRRM), which both rely on families to talk together about sexual health and to link healthcare to career, educational and social services. \u201cYoung people want more from their parents than just \u2018no\u2019, [don\u2019t have sex],\u201d Guilamo-Ramos said. That was true of Hector, who was born and raised in the Bronx by his Mexican family. Hector, who is now 19, first heard about HIV/Aids in a health class at school, then never learned about it again. The only other time he would hear references to it was when LGBT people were shown on television \u2013 and his parents would make comments about how all \u201chomos\u201d were infected. Despite the hateful rhetoric that had flowed through Hector\u2019s home, when a doctor told him his sweating and fevers were caused by HIV and he would need a support system to help him through treatment, he was quick to allow the doctor to tell his mom what was going on. She hadn\u2019t known he was gay, and when Hector confirmed he was, she did not tell his father or anyone else in the family. \u201cSupport for youth is essential because if you don\u2019t have support your life is over \u2013 that\u2019s how it felt for me,\u201d he said.Hector, who has taken a break from university to deal with depression, is clear-headed about how his parents\u2019 homophobia is their issue, not his. He has worked hard to educate them while also caring for himself and looking after his needs. One point of hope for the Bronx: the US health department named it as one of 48 counties it is targeting in its plan to end HIV/Aids. This good news comes after years of the Trump administration implementing policies that target both the LGBT and Latino communities. In the very same State of the Union speech in which Trump made the HIV/Aids announcement, he also spent a considerable amount of time railing against immigrants. Guillermo Chacon, the president of the Latino Commission on Aids, said the Latino LGBT community was further stigmatized by these conflicting messages and by actions like the ban on transgender people serving in the military. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help when at the highest level government, somebody said: \u2018We don\u2019t want any more trans in the army,\u2019\u201d Chacon said, in an interview at the Oasis Latino LGBTS Wellness Center in Manhattan. The center welcomes everyone (S is for straight) but specifically targets the Latino community. Chacon continued: \u201cThe signal you send is that it\u2019s OK to reject people who are different from you.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A British football fan who was detained in United Arab Emirates after being accosted by security officials for wearing a Qatar football shirt, has told the Guardian he was convinced he was going to die. Ali Issa Ahmad, 26, a security guard from Wolverhampton, said he was stabbed in prison, and deprived of sleep, food and water for several days while being held in a security building. \u201cI thought 100% that I was going to die in the UAE,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I would commit suicide rather than letting them kill me.\u201d Ahmad had travelled to the UAE for a holiday in January. While he was there he got a ticket for an Asian Cup match between Qatar and Iraq on 22 January. The Arsenal fan wore a Qatar shirt to the match, not knowing that doing so is an offence in the UAE punishable with a large fine and an extended jail sentence. Hours after arriving back in Britain on Thursday, he told the Guardian how he had been arrested, beaten, interrogated and detained following an initial stop by security officials for wearing the Qatar shirt. He had a series of knife wounds to his arm, injuries to his chest and a stab wound to his side, and appeared dazed, exhausted and in a state of shock. He also said that a security official had knocked out a tooth when he punched him in the face. Ahmad said his troubles had begun when officials accosted him after Qatar\u2019s game against Iraq and demanded to know why he was wearing a Qatar shirt.They demanded he hand over the shirt, which he did. He then drove back from the match in Abu Dhabi to his hotel in Dubai, but the men followed him. They were still at his hotel the next morning. He said he decided to go to the beach for the day, and still unaware that it was an serious offence in the UAE to do so, he wore a different Qatar football shirt. He was followed again, and on the way back to his hotel the men who had been following him flagged down his car. When he got out, they forced him into the back of his car, handcuffed him, cut the shirt from him inflicting several knife wounds to his arm and chest, punched him in the face and put a plastic bag over his face. \u201cI felt a flash when the bag was over my head and realised they were filming me,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought they were going to kill me.\u201d After the incident the security officials let him go. He said he was left bleeding in the car, vomited and felt shocked and dazed. He drove into a petrol station and called an ambulance. Security officials arrived at the scene shortly after the paramedics and interrogated him. He was taken to hospital to have his injuries treated, and then detained in a security building. He said he was deprived of sleep, food and water for several days before being transferred to a police cell in Sharjah where he was held until 12 February. He said he was stabbed in the side one night, he believes by another prisoner. He boarded a flight back to the UK on Wednesday evening and arrived on Thursday. Although Ahmad is fluent in spoken and written Arabic he said he was not permitted to read documents he was forced to sign. He said he had received assistance from British embassy officials during his detention. \u201cBefore I got on the plane back to the UK a UAE official at the airport said to me: \u2018We are a very good country.\u2019 I don\u2019t know how I can get justice for what happened to me but if I can I will do it.\u201d The UAE embassy was approached for comment. UAE officials previously issued a statement saying Ahmad had gone to the police station in Sharjah claiming that he had been harassed and beaten up by UAE football fans for cheering the Qatar team at the Asian Cup. The statement said: \u201cThe police took him to hospital where a doctor who examined him concluded that his injuries were inconsistent with his account of events and appeared to be self-inflicted.

      "body": "<p>Full of misplaced optimism, Eunice packed a white straw hat decorated with ribbons, white church gloves and a silk scarf before leaving Jamaica in 1948 for her new life in England.</p> <p>A year later, she looks at them, still unworn, still folded in her suitcase, and laughs sadly. \u201cWhich film did you think you were coming to star in? Well now you know.\u201d Life in England hasn\u2019t exactly turned out how she expected. She\u2019s living in a damp room in a shared house, barely any furniture, a new baby sleeping in a cardboard box; the father, a white English doctor, nowhere to be seen.</p> <p>We\u2019re familiar with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/23/immigration-windrush-west-indians-jamaica-britain\">Pathe images of smartly dressed people from the West Indies disembarking from the Empire Windrush</a> in 1948, hopeful and expectant, happily unaware of the frosty reception they were about to receive.</p> <p>The eight 15-minute monologues that make up Soon Gone: A Windrush Chronicle look at what happened next, tracing Eunice\u2019s family for the next 70 years, over four generations. These are beautiful self-contained stories, but together they explore the experience of migration, each generation examining their identity in a country that has been less than welcoming.</p> <p>It starts with Eunice, so confident when she arrived to work as a nurse in London, but quickly left contemplating the mismatch between the England she had imagined when she left her family and the vastly inferior reality.</p> <p>Jumping through the decades, each episode is set against the backdrop of key moments in the history of British race relations \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/17/new-cross-fire-we-cant-forget\">1981 New Cross fire</a>, where 13 black teenagers were killed in an apparent arson attack and no one was ever prosecuted, Stephen Lawrence\u2019s murder in 1993, the 2011 riots, and last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/25/high-court-orders-new-inquest-into-home-office-role-in-windrush-citizen-death\">Home Office scandal</a>. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/kwame-kwei-armah\">Kwame Kwei-Armah</a>\u2019s series addresses bigger issues of love and family, belonging and home, what it means to be an immigrant or the grandchild of an immigrant, what it costs to become British, the struggle for acceptance and the parallel struggle to hold on to your past.</p> <p>The price of acceptance shifts from generation to generation. Eunice\u2019s husband, hospital porter Cyrus, thinks the way to survive is to: \u201cWork hard, keep your head down, stay out of trouble.\u201d It\u2019s a mantra adopted by his son, Kevin, the only black employee in a garage owned by a white man, who tells himself in the third monologue set in 1968, to ignore the daily abuse he\u2019s getting from colleagues (\u201crubber lips\u201d, \u201csmile or we can\u2019t see you\u201d) and from pretty much everyone else he encounters.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want confrontation. I don\u2019t want to cause a fuss. Just keep my head down. You\u2019ve got the rozzers stopping you, geezers want to fight you, women crossing the street from you, children calling you names, teachers berating you, security guards staring at you, no one praising you, bus drivers blocking you, pubs not serving you, no one liking you, people just lying about you \u2026 no one liking you.\u201d</p> <p>Jonathan Jules, as Kevin, painfully captures the confusion of a man teetering on the brink of happiness, but badly wounded by the constant slights he knows he is meant to laugh off. He\u2019s so embarrassed to have even mentioned them that he abruptly switches to explaining how to clean grit from car engines.</p> <p>In the next monologue, his sister, Yvonne, refuses to avoid confrontation, and is burning with anger, furiously banging nails into placards she is making for a protest at the police\u2019s failure to investigate the New Cross fire. She just wants to keep her own son safe, she says. Later we see that she hasn\u2019t managed to keep him safe at all, and he\u2019s on probation after fighting a new generation of racist bullies.</p> <p>Some things change over the decades. The older family members are beaten by teddy boys, harassed at school and work for being black. Adaptation to hostile environments becomes second nature, a third-generation Windrush child says.</p> <p>But by 2019, Eunice\u2019s great-granddaughter, mixed race and light skinned, is bullied at school for daring to describe herself as black. She\u2019s devastated to be branded a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/27/rachel-dolezal-race-white\">\u201cRachel Dolezal\u201d</a> by classmates, worried by the invisibility of her connection to her Caribbean family, asking herself: \u201cWhat is blackness, and have I got it?\u201d</p> <p>Other things do not change at all. The series ends with Cyrus (movingly played as an older man by Sir Lenny Henry), still struggling to be accepted after 70 years in Britain, a victim of the Home Office\u2019s Windrush scandal, facing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/20/its-inhumane-the-windrush-victims-who-have-lost-jobs-homes-and-loved-ones\">deportation threats, the council refusing to pay for his care</a>. \u201cHow dare they, after all these years, ask me \u2013 ask us \u2013 if we have the right to live here?\u201d he says. \u201cThis is my home.\u201d</p> <p>So much is packed into each tight episode; these complex stories of intertwined lives offer tantalising snapshots of an epic family drama. The characters are so brilliant, the writing so good, these brief segments are not enough; I was left wanting to watch more. The BBC should commission the writers to develop this into a full-length series.</p> <p>\u2022 From Sunday to Wednesday on BBC Four at 10pm</p>",

      "bodyText": "Full of misplaced optimism, Eunice packed a white straw hat decorated with ribbons, white church gloves and a silk scarf before leaving Jamaica in 1948 for her new life in England. A year later, she looks at them, still unworn, still folded in her suitcase, and laughs sadly. \u201cWhich film did you think you were coming to star in? Well now you know.\u201d Life in England hasn\u2019t exactly turned out how she expected. She\u2019s living in a damp room in a shared house, barely any furniture, a new baby sleeping in a cardboard box; the father, a white English doctor, nowhere to be seen. We\u2019re familiar with the Pathe images of smartly dressed people from the West Indies disembarking from the Empire Windrush in 1948, hopeful and expectant, happily unaware of the frosty reception they were about to receive. The eight 15-minute monologues that make up Soon Gone: A Windrush Chronicle look at what happened next, tracing Eunice\u2019s family for the next 70 years, over four generations. These are beautiful self-contained stories, but together they explore the experience of migration, each generation examining their identity in a country that has been less than welcoming. It starts with Eunice, so confident when she arrived to work as a nurse in London, but quickly left contemplating the mismatch between the England she had imagined when she left her family and the vastly inferior reality. Jumping through the decades, each episode is set against the backdrop of key moments in the history of British race relations \u2013 the 1981 New Cross fire, where 13 black teenagers were killed in an apparent arson attack and no one was ever prosecuted, Stephen Lawrence\u2019s murder in 1993, the 2011 riots, and last year\u2019s Home Office scandal. But Kwame Kwei-Armah\u2019s series addresses bigger issues of love and family, belonging and home, what it means to be an immigrant or the grandchild of an immigrant, what it costs to become British, the struggle for acceptance and the parallel struggle to hold on to your past. The price of acceptance shifts from generation to generation. Eunice\u2019s husband, hospital porter Cyrus, thinks the way to survive is to: \u201cWork hard, keep your head down, stay out of trouble.\u201d It\u2019s a mantra adopted by his son, Kevin, the only black employee in a garage owned by a white man, who tells himself in the third monologue set in 1968, to ignore the daily abuse he\u2019s getting from colleagues (\u201crubber lips\u201d, \u201csmile or we can\u2019t see you\u201d) and from pretty much everyone else he encounters. \u201cI don\u2019t want confrontation. I don\u2019t want to cause a fuss. Just keep my head down. You\u2019ve got the rozzers stopping you, geezers want to fight you, women crossing the street from you, children calling you names, teachers berating you, security guards staring at you, no one praising you, bus drivers blocking you, pubs not serving you, no one liking you, people just lying about you \u2026 no one liking you.\u201d Jonathan Jules, as Kevin, painfully captures the confusion of a man teetering on the brink of happiness, but badly wounded by the constant slights he knows he is meant to laugh off. He\u2019s so embarrassed to have even mentioned them that he abruptly switches to explaining how to clean grit from car engines. In the next monologue, his sister, Yvonne, refuses to avoid confrontation, and is burning with anger, furiously banging nails into placards she is making for a protest at the police\u2019s failure to investigate the New Cross fire. She just wants to keep her own son safe, she says. Later we see that she hasn\u2019t managed to keep him safe at all, and he\u2019s on probation after fighting a new generation of racist bullies. Some things change over the decades. The older family members are beaten by teddy boys, harassed at school and work for being black. Adaptation to hostile environments becomes second nature, a third-generation Windrush child says. But by 2019, Eunice\u2019s great-granddaughter, mixed race and light skinned, is bullied at school for daring to describe herself as black. She\u2019s devastated to be branded a \u201cRachel Dolezal\u201d by classmates, worried by the invisibility of her connection to her Caribbean family, asking herself: \u201cWhat is blackness, and have I got it?\u201d Other things do not change at all. The series ends with Cyrus (movingly played as an older man by Sir Lenny Henry), still struggling to be accepted after 70 years in Britain, a victim of the Home Office\u2019s Windrush scandal, facing deportation threats, the council refusing to pay for his care. \u201cHow dare they, after all these years, ask me \u2013 ask us \u2013 if we have the right to live here?\u201d he says. \u201cThis is my home.\u201d So much is packed into each tight episode; these complex stories of intertwined lives offer tantalising snapshots of an epic family drama. The characters are so brilliant, the writing so good, these brief segments are not enough; I was left wanting to watch more. The BBC should commission the writers to develop this into a full-length series. \u2022 From Sunday to Wednesday on BBC Four at 10pm",

I tried it over a white shirt, which I expected to work but in fact made me look like a trainee sommelier circa 1985. But then I tried it over a pale blue shirt. Bullseye. With navy trousers it made an entire new outfit \u2013 shopped for nothing from my own wardrobe, which is my absolute favourite way to shop.

      "bodyText": "You say West Ham; I say Milan streetstyle. You say Aston Villa; I say fashion influencer. You say Burnley\u2026 yup, you get the picture. It\u2019s the one painted in claret and blue. Actually, it\u2019s burgundy and blue, if you don\u2019t mind. Or eggplant and denim, if we\u2019re going full New York fashion week. Whatever you call it, the point is that, of all the modish combinations that have had their moment in the sun since colour blocking first became A Thing, burgundy and blue is the one that has stuck. Every fashion season, a new duo gets thrown up \u2013 I am pretty sure I wrote a column in praise of pink with orange at one point. Sorry about that, dudes. Most of them stay on the fashion page, without making the transition to real life. Burgundy with blue, however, gets seen and photographed at fashion week, every season without fail, because it works. Burgundy with blue is unexpected enough to look interesting, but subtle enough not to look ridiculous. Both are pretty colours that are, nonetheless, more utility than party. They are the colours of school uniforms, of silk ties, of sky-blue, button-down shirts and polished oxblood brogues. This top is an old one of mine by Roland Mouret. For years I wore it either with black trousers and then, more recently, with a pleated below-the-knee black skirt. And then one day it was so cold that even the 14 layers of St Tropez Gradual Tan, on which I rely for leg and arm insulation in the winter, weren\u2019t cutting it. I tried it over a white shirt, which I expected to work but in fact made me look like a trainee sommelier circa 1985. But then I tried it over a pale blue shirt. Bullseye. With navy trousers it made an entire new outfit \u2013 shopped for nothing from my own wardrobe, which is my absolute favourite way to shop. (Today, I\u2019m wearing my top with a skirt that\u2019s on sale in Zara now.) Fashion tends to gloss over the humdrum detail when it comes to colour blocking. Like, what shoes? What bag? What coat? Should they all be burgundy and blue? Can they be black? I mean, this stuff matters, right? And the answer is: no to all-burgundy-and-blue, but also no to all black. A deep blue, like the shoes I\u2019m wearing here, is good. Or a dark charcoal grey. Or white, or cream. (How many times do I have to tell you to buy a pair of white ankle boots?) That\u2019s the i\u2019s dotted and t\u2019s crossed. Now burgundy and blue makes perfect sense. \u2022 Jess wears her own top. Skirt, \u00a325.99, zara.com.

      "bodyText": "When Pina Bausch died in 2009 it seemed unthinkable that her company would go on without her, such was the groundbreaking, guru-like choreographer\u2019s singularity. Clearly her company thought so too. While they continued to perform her works around the world, it was nine years before they commissioned anyone to make a new full-length work. And here it is, by Greek choreographer Dimitris Papaioannou \u2013 a huge Bausch fan since he saw her Caf\u00e9 M\u00fcller aged 19, and a great fit for the company. Since She opens with a tribute of sorts: a procession of dancers walking on chairs, just like the ones used in Caf\u00e9 M\u00fcller. There is something slightly uncanny about the way the piece is so recognisably the work of Tanztheater Wuppertal, and of Papaioannou too. Both have a line in dreamlike weirdness, incidents and interactions taken out of their contexts to create an absurdist \u201cother\u201d world, but one that cuts close to the bone. Papaioannou, who trained in fine art, is interested in manipulating materials as well as bodies. The set is a tall pile of foam mats, looking like a slate mountain, for the often semi-naked dancers to slither down. We see long tubes threaded through a man\u2019s trousers forcing him to scuttle like a multi-legged beast, and a woman\u2019s dress pierced with arrows. There are arresting moments, including a wonderful scene in which Ophelia Young is carried atop a table that\u2019s being spun in circles while she magically stays in one place, still but for the wind through her hair, radiant and regal like the figurehead of a ship. Papaioannou\u2019s imagination and love of illusion can be fanciful, almost vaudevillian, but here there is a nagging sense of the degrading or unseemly beneath. (I won\u2019t even tell you what Azusa Seyama bakes into a pie.)

The finale \u2013 also the shortest episode, at just 18 minutes \u2013 is a big postmodern blowout, with Crazy Rich Asians\u2019 Awkwafina and Community\u2019s Yvette Nicole Brown playing characters in a TV show slowly becoming self-aware and demolishing the fourth wall.

There is also some entertaining nose-thumbing at HBO, as Haves are mandated to plug in to a Prestige TV module that immerses them in a crude but entertaining mash-up of The Wire and Game of Thrones.</p> <p>Yet, even at a sprightly average of 25 minutes, most Weird City episodes feel like sketch ideas that have been stretched out a little too far. These are the sort of cheerfully macabre future-shock satires that 2000AD magazine routinely cranks out in four pages. If it wasn\u2019t for the consistently winning cast bringing so much energy and enthusiasm, Weird City would feel like much more of a drag. It\u2019s certainly a coup for YouTube to be in business with the lauded creator of Get Out.

The finale \u2013 also the shortest episode, at just 18 minutes \u2013 is a big postmodern blowout, with Crazy Rich Asians\u2019 Awkwafina and Community\u2019s Yvette Nicole Brown playing characters in a TV show slowly becoming self-aware and demolishing the fourth wall. It\u2019s so much fun that it\u2019s only when the dust has settled that your realise it has barely any connection to the overarching Weird City setting. If Black Mirror \u2013 a clear inspiration and satirical target \u2013 mostly leaves viewers feeling bad, Weird City has a much wackier energy, in keeping with its cheap-and-cheerful, slightly garish visual style. It also features a fine collection of absurd, semi-futuristic names such as Blarnaby, Jathryn and Nurmph (co-creator Sanders cameos as a dim cop called \u201cGirth Haddock\u201d). There is also some entertaining nose-thumbing at HBO, as Haves are mandated to plug in to a Prestige TV module that immerses them in a crude but entertaining mash-up of The Wire and Game of Thrones. Yet, even at a sprightly average of 25 minutes, most Weird City episodes feel like sketch ideas that have been stretched out a little too far. These are the sort of cheerfully macabre future-shock satires that 2000AD magazine routinely cranks out in four pages. If it wasn\u2019t for the consistently winning cast bringing so much energy and enthusiasm, Weird City would feel like much more of a drag. It\u2019s certainly a coup for YouTube to be in business with the lauded creator of Get Out. But the industrious Peele is also rebooting The Twilight Zone this year \u2013 a much more venerable anthology brand, presumably funded with less of a Have Not budget \u2013 so Weird City may end up feeling like little more than a warm-up. Weird City is available on YouTube Premium now",

An embarrassment I missed, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/12/endeavour-its-inspector-morse-with-a-moustache-and-surprisingly-great\">new series of Endeavour</a> \u2013 featuring a great nod to the creator of Morse near the end, with a poster on the wall of the police station for the retirement of \u201cMr C Dexter\u201d complete with a photo of the man himself \u2013 started on ITV. Quite why broadcasters think awards shows make brilliant TV has always escaped me. Not only do they invariably overrun, as people you\u2019ve sometimes heard of give rambling acceptance speeches, thanking people you\u2019ve certainly never heard of, but the format is numbingly predictable. A bad joke, someone reading out the four nominations, a few clips of the show in question and then the winner is announced. Repeat for four hours, ending with a lifetime achievement award for someone the organisers think is getting on a bit and might die soon.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t even look much fun for those who have been nominated \u2013 imagine the pressure of having to look thrilled you\u2019ve lost out \u2013 let alone those stuck at home watching it. No one would dream of broadcasting the Estate Agent of the Year awards, so I can only assume TV producers are so self-absorbed they believe everyone must be as fascinated by their industry as they are. Though it could be that I\u2019m just a miserable git who can\u2019t take pleasure in other people\u2019s triumphs, as I have so few of my own. The only award I\u2019ve ever won was back in 2000, when I collected the coveted trophy for the best article about stamp collecting to appear in the national press. Probably on the grounds that it was the only article about stamp collecting to appear in the national press. Now that should have been televised.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>A complaint comes into the Guardian from the Department for Transport, objecting to the political sketch I had written that day \u2013 reassuring to know they are such keen readers \u2013 before Chris Grayling\u2019s latest outing in the House of Commons to defend his decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/02/grayling-no-deal-brexit-ferry-contract-company-seaborne-freight-no-ships\">award a \u00a313.8m contract</a> to Seaborne Freight. A contract it was now cancelling on the grounds the whole project was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/09/government-cancels-brexit-ferry-contract-with-no-ship-firm\">self-evidently a nonstarter</a>. In particular, the DfT was upset I had alleged the department had not done due diligence on Seaborne before the contract had been awarded. Due diligence had been done, it insisted. To which the only possible response was to wonder if things might actually have been better if the DfT had just drawn straws for the contract.</p> <p>In its defence, the department claimed its due diligence had identified that Seaborne was a high-risk proposition, on the grounds it was a new operation that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/30/no-deal-brexit-ferry-company-owns-no-ships-and-has-never-run-ferry-service\">didn\u2019t have any ferries</a>, its directors had no experience in running a ferry company, it did not currently operate from Ramsgate or Ostend, had yet to enter a binding contract to use these ports, and there was a danger the service might not be operational when it was needed. A bit of a disadvantage considering this was the government\u2019s emergency planning for a no-deal Brexit. The National Audit Office had even told the government Seaborne was unable to satisfactorily meet the criteria set out in the DfT\u2019s tender. It has also since emerged the DfT made do with written assurances \u2013 presumably scribbled on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/13/no-written-guarantee-before-ferry-contract-awarded-says-official\">back of an envelope</a> \u2013 from Seaborne saying it had all the necessary financial guarantees in place, without checking if such guarantees existed. Despite all this, Grayling went ahead and awarded Seaborne the contract. Laugh or cry. Your choice.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>Grayling shouldn\u2019t take his position as the most incompetent minister in the government for granted. There are plenty of others challenging him for that coveted title. Most notably Liam Fox. At the 2017 Conservative party conference, the international trade secretary insisted the government would be able to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/20/liam-fox-uk-eu-trade-deal-after-brexit-easiest-human-history\">roll over all 40</a> of the EU\u2019s existing external trade deals \u201cthe second after midnight\u201d on the day Britain left the EU on 29 March 2019. It has now emerged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/13/brexit-uk-trade-deals-eu\">six of the agreements</a> have been signed off, including those with the Faroe Islands and the Palestinian Authority. Good news for fish and cement. Of the others, eight are considered to be off-track, 19 are significantly off-track and six have absolutely no chance of being completed.</p> <p>This overall success rate of less than 20% led to \u201cair miles\u201d Fox being brought to the Commons to answer an urgent question on his department\u2019s failures. Fox was thoroughly unrepentant \u2013 earlier promises clearly mean nothing to him \u2013 and urged everyone to celebrate his achievement in having signed six deals that were almost as good as the ones we already had as members of the EU. He also seemed utterly bewildered that Japan and South Korea were using Brexit as an opportunity to try to get the UK to agree to worse terms. Ken Clarke gently pointed out that could have something to do with us having less clout outside the EU. Fox disagreed. He thought it more likely the EU had nobbled the Japanese, urging them to make his life more difficult. The stupidity bar has never been lower.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>Research from the Resolution Foundation uncovered the curious finding that people are at their happiest at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/feb/13/people-are-happiest-at-ages-of-16-and-70-in-uk-says-study\">ages of 16 and 70</a>. I\u2019ve yet to reach 70, so I will reserve judgement on that and report back in eight years\u2019 time. My guess is a lot will depend on what kind of shape me, my wife and my family are in then and that we are all still alive. And indeed how much pleasure I am getting from the pension I may have been mis-sold in my 30s that is projected to give me an annual income of roughly \u00a34,000. Doesn\u2019t sound like I will be spending my retirement doing several Viking River Cruises a year. Though maybe the secret to happiness at 70 is not spending time with people with much more money than you.</p> <p>I have, though, most definitely been 16 and wouldn\u2019t have bookmarked it as one of my happier times. I was a late developer \u2013 emotionally, physically and intellectually \u2013 and at 16 I was far more child than adult and just felt self-conscious and awkward. I was aware there was a more exciting world out there but I just didn\u2019t have any of the inner resources or self-confidence to go out and grasp it. At the age of 16, I spent most of my time hiding in the shadows of my own life, desperately wishing I was someone else. But then maybe I am just a bit of a statistical outlier. Someone whose iffy mental health makes it easier to define periods of happiness as the absence of anxiety and depression, rather than an active embrace of the many good things I have in my life.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>Keith Richards said in an interview with Mojo he found giving up cigarettes harder than giving up heroin. Having given up both, I can\u2019t say I had the same experience. In rehab, I was made to go full cold turkey \u2013 no methadone, no tranquillisers, no sleeping pills \u2013 as the ethos of the centre was to give you an experience you wouldn\u2019t forget. As a result, I spent 10 days throwing up, having violent diarrhoea, cramps and all-over body pain, sweating heavily and being unable to sleep for more than a few minutes at a time. All the time knowing one hit could put a temporary end to the misery. I stuck it out, though, because for the first time in many years my desire to live was greater than my desire to die.</p> <p>That was in many ways the easiest bit of giving up heroin. Staying off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/22/patrick-melrose-captures-heroin-addiction-perfectly-it-brought-my-memories-flooding-back\">became a life\u2019s work</a>. Going to meetings of Narcotics Anonymous, where for many weeks I hid at the back, too scared and ashamed to open my mouth, yet longing for a sense of fellowship. Going to therapy and learning how to interact with the world, unmediated and unmedicated. Finding out how to live with being badly damaged goods and to make the most of what I had. It has been an uneven process with many low points, but one achieved without drugs and alcohol for 32 years. My one unequivocal success story. In contrast, giving up the cigarettes was a breeze. I just woke up one morning, decided I was fed up with not being able to breathe properly and worrying about getting cancer, and stopped. No real longings, no real withdrawal symptoms. Maybe I just got lucky.</p> <p><strong>Digested week, digested:</strong> Parliament votes against the Brexit motion it passed two weeks earlier.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ee34de668a15fb8affb1385a744a5ac72fc6248\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ee34de668a15fb8affb1385a744a5ac72fc6248/0_73_4080_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vladimir Putin in skiing gear surrounded by reporters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reporters around Vladimir Putin: \u2018So Vlad.

Parsnips sometimes have a sweetness that needs offsetting, and are at their finest paired with umami flavours. This week\u2019s recipes use this sweetness to great effect: the first is a savoury winter crumble, the second a roast parsnip so good I now find it hard to make them any other way. Creamy parsnip, leek and white bean crumble A filling, all-in-one meal that\u2019s gracing our table at least once a week this winter. Vegans can use an oat creme fraiche and a vegan parmesan. Prep 25 min Cook 1 hr 10 min Serves 4 6 leeks (about 750g), trimmed, washed halved and cut into 4cm lengths 4 parsnips: 2 peeled and roughly chopped into 2cm pieces, 2 coarsely grated 2 tbsp olive oil 3 sprigs thyme, leaves picked Salt and black pepper 200ml creme fraiche 2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped Zest of 1 lemon 1 tsp cider vinegar 75ml vegetable stock 1 x 400g tin white haricot beans, drained For the crumble topping 50g jumbo rolled oats 30g cold butter, cut into cubes 45g plain flour 20g pumpkin seeds 20g parmesan/vegetarian Italian hard cheese, finely grated Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/350F/gas 6. Toss the leeks and chopped parsnips with the olive oil in a 20 x 30 pie dish or deep roasting tin. Sprinkle over the leaves from two of the thyme sprigs, and season well.

Using your fingertips, rub the oats, butter, flour and pumpkin seeds together with the remaining grated parsnip and thyme leaves so that it starts to clump and look like chunky breadcrumbs. Chill in the fridge until needed. Once the leeks and parsnips have softened, remove from the oven and toss through the bean and creme fraiche mix. Remove the crumble topping from the fridge, sprinkle it over the filling, grate over the cheese and return to the oven for 30 minutes. You can assemble the crumble, cover and chill in the fridge up to 24 hours in advance before the final bake. Serve with warm, crusty bread and lemon-dressed salad or greens. Miso and sesame roasted parsnips I serve these as a side, but they are flavourful enough for a meal to be built around them. This week, I had them with brown rice, greens and a good drizzle of chilli oil. Prep 5 min Cook 25 min Serves 4 as a side 50g white miso 1 \u00bd tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp honey 2 tbsp olive oil 6 parsnips, halved lengthways 1 tsp black or white toasted sesame seeds Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/350F/gas 6.

      "body": "<p>ClassPass is a gym class subscription service that is basically like the Netflix of fad exercise trends. For a monthly fee you can arrange a series of one-time stints doing every imaginable workout: from pole dancing to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-swimming-blog/2014/jan/21/hydrospinning-fitness-spin-class-cycling-underwater\">hydrospinning</a>.</p> <p>So its recent announcement of the fastest-growing category on the platform in 2018 may surprise you: it\u2019s the boring old treadmill. Offerings like interval classes from the Mile-High Run Club and something called \u201cTread \u2019n Shed\u201d at Crunch Gym were particularly popular, but basically they all involve running indoors in a treadmill pack while an instructor intones mantras, shouts encouragement, and critiques your running form.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/dec/16/the-perfect-ways-to-get-fit-in-20-seconds-an-hour-or-six-months\">The perfect ways to get fit \u2013 in 20 seconds, an hour or six months</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yes, it seems we\u2019ve exhausted every possible exercise trend, from bikram yoga to SoulCycle, and now we\u2019ve finally come full circle. Running is the hot new fitness trend \u2013 only this time it somehow costs lots of money.</p> <p>It\u2019s a trend that is being reflected across the world of fitness. Running classes at the fancy gym Equinox have amassed such a following that the chain is opening a line of treadmill-only studios. The \u201c<a href=\"https://www.equinox.com/precisionrunninglab/chestnuthill\">precision running labs</a>\u201d are, more or less, darkened rooms full of people running in place at the whims of a fiery, toned instructor. Under the supposedly appealing promise that \u201cyou don\u2019t have to go outside to blaze new trails\u201d, Equinox, ever on-brand, provides an exclusive running environment, transforming a run to \u201can out-of-body experience with immersive light and sound\u201d and \u201cair enriched by an O2 vaporizer\u201d \u2013 because what kind of loser breathes regular, un-enhanced oxygen?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BPsDek9AuwE/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "ClassPass is a gym class subscription service that is basically like the Netflix of fad exercise trends. For a monthly fee you can arrange a series of one-time stints doing every imaginable workout: from pole dancing to hydrospinning. So its recent announcement of the fastest-growing category on the platform in 2018 may surprise you: it\u2019s the boring old treadmill. Offerings like interval classes from the Mile-High Run Club and something called \u201cTread \u2019n Shed\u201d at Crunch Gym were particularly popular, but basically they all involve running indoors in a treadmill pack while an instructor intones mantras, shouts encouragement, and critiques your running form. Yes, it seems we\u2019ve exhausted every possible exercise trend, from bikram yoga to SoulCycle, and now we\u2019ve finally come full circle. Running is the hot new fitness trend \u2013 only this time it somehow costs lots of money. It\u2019s a trend that is being reflected across the world of fitness. Running classes at the fancy gym Equinox have amassed such a following that the chain is opening a line of treadmill-only studios. The \u201cprecision running labs\u201d are, more or less, darkened rooms full of people running in place at the whims of a fiery, toned instructor. Under the supposedly appealing promise that \u201cyou don\u2019t have to go outside to blaze new trails\u201d, Equinox, ever on-brand, provides an exclusive running environment, transforming a run to \u201can out-of-body experience with immersive light and sound\u201d and \u201cair enriched by an O2 vaporizer\u201d \u2013 because what kind of loser breathes regular, un-enhanced oxygen? Thanks to the superhuman amenities and hands-on coaching, a single hour-long treadmill course can run about $35 a pop \u2013 compared with the outdoor running price of \u201cfree\u201d. The price has not been off-putting: locations have already opened in Santa Monica, California, and Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, and they will be followed this spring by New York and Los Angeles.

      "bodyText": "Last month, Hartwig Fischer, director of the British Museum, home to the Parthenon marbles for the past 200 years, gave an interview to the Greek newspaper Ta Nea. He exlained why, in his view, the marbles should not be given back to Greece and made the \u2013 let\u2019s call it rather unreflected \u2013 statement that taking objects from their original place into a museum in another part of the world can be a creative act. Others quickly paraphrased this as \u201clooting art is creative\u201d \u2013 and a perfect media storm began. Worldwide, in dozens of articles taking up Hartwig\u2019s statement, one could find all the pros and cons for keeping or returning the marbles. These are arguments that have been developed since the antique treasures were taken away from the Acropolis at the beginning of the 19th century: that a world-class museum would be diminished if the marbles were given back; that they are part of Greece\u2019s heritage, as argued by the culture minister in the 1980s, Melina Mercouri; the assumption that the marbles wouldn\u2019t have survived in Greek hands; the need for the most iconic pieces of ancient Greece to be shown and seen at their place of origin; the legality of their transfer to England; the illegality of their transfer to England. And so on. Both sides, the Britons as well as the Greeks, have valid arguments. Maybe even the Greek gods would have had difficulty in deciding whether the marbles -should be kept in the British Museum or returned to Greece. It may well be that they would have come to the same point as they did in Aeschylus\u2019s play The Eumenides: a stalemate. An equal number of votes for and against restitution.

Painted while Kandinsky was teaching at the Bauhaus in Dessau, it is a meditation on the power of circles, which he considered to be crucial to his works. The painting of colourful spheres seemingly in orbit against a black, cosmic background once hung in the exotic living room of the Dessau Bauhaus quarters he shared with Klee, next to an entirely gilded wall.</p> <p>Also creating excitement are works by Schlemmer, who is arguably associated more than any other artist with the Bauhaus style. He is credited with continuously reinventing the figurative tradition of western art and his striking painting Tischgesellschaft (Group at Table), depicts figures in perspectival space rendered in geometric shapes, and is considered to be extremely rare.</p> <p>Its estimated auction price of \u00a31m-1.5m may well be exceeded, owing to the fact that no Schlemmer oil painting has come on to the market for more than 20 years. The expectation is that a new record for a Schlemmer work is likely to be made.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dc5a8aef6823c5120aafd704c5a4dbf810ad6202\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc5a8aef6823c5120aafd704c5a4dbf810ad6202/0_185_7891_4736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oskar Schlemmer\u2019s Tischgesellschaft (Group at Table)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oskar Schlemmer\u2019s Tischgesellschaft (Group at Table), which has an estimate of \u00a31m-1.5m.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Sotheby\u2019s</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThese Schlemmer works are immensely rare,\u201d Boyd-Bowman said. \u201cThose that exist are almost always in museums, so for a potential buyer it\u2019s very exciting.

      "bodyText": "A collection of seldom-viewed paintings by key proponents of the influential Bauhaus art and design school are to be brought together for a rare show in London before going under the hammer at the end of the month. The exhibition, Bauhaus at 100 Celebrating the Artists and Their Legacy, will run for six days from 20 February at Sotheby\u2019s in London. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to see things that haven\u2019t been seen in public for decades and never in this constellation,\u201d said Thomas Boyd-Bowman, the head of impressionist and modern art evening sales at Sotheby\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much the best free show in town.\u201d The 25 works will showcase the burst of creative energy of the groundbreaking art movement founded 100 years ago in Germany. Its anniversary is being marked with thousands of events across the world, from exhibitions and films to symposia and dance, celebrating the profound way in which it shaped a global artistic vision and is still having an impact today. Among the highlights will be paintings by Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Oskar Schlemmer, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy and Lyonel Feininger, all of whom were recruited to the Bauhaus faculty by its founder, the architect Walter Gropius. The most valuable work, due to be auctioned on 26 February, is Kandinsky\u2019s Vertiefte Regung (Deepened Impulse), an oil on canvas from 1928, which it is estimated may raise \u00a37.5m. Painted while Kandinsky was teaching at the Bauhaus in Dessau, it is a meditation on the power of circles, which he considered to be crucial to his works. The painting of colourful spheres seemingly in orbit against a black, cosmic background once hung in the exotic living room of the Dessau Bauhaus quarters he shared with Klee, next to an entirely gilded wall. Also creating excitement are works by Schlemmer, who is arguably associated more than any other artist with the Bauhaus style. He is credited with continuously reinventing the figurative tradition of western art and his striking painting Tischgesellschaft (Group at Table), depicts figures in perspectival space rendered in geometric shapes, and is considered to be extremely rare. Its estimated auction price of \u00a31m-1.5m may well be exceeded, owing to the fact that no Schlemmer oil painting has come on to the market for more than 20 years. The expectation is that a new record for a Schlemmer work is likely to be made. \u201cThese Schlemmer works are immensely rare,\u201d Boyd-Bowman said. \u201cThose that exist are almost always in museums, so for a potential buyer it\u2019s very exciting. For those who can\u2019t buy it, coming to the show quite simply it\u2019s a great chance to see a Schlemmer in Britain, which doesn\u2019t happen very often.\u201d The works displayed together show aspects of the genesis of the Bauhaus \u2013 typified in Feininger\u2019s abstract work Bridge II \u2013 a cubist rendition of a gothic bridge near Weimar, the city where Bauhaus was born \u2013 as well as emphasising how eclectic in their tastes many of the artists were. \u201cThey were like cultural magpies, taking and picking up cues from French avant garde and cubism, as well as emerging from their own movement of German expressionism, into something which is a sort of exciting concoction of all of them,\u201d Boyd-Bowman said. Moholy-Nagy\u2019s Segments is made up of one long rectangular bar and a series of semicircles, creating a rhythm and balance, which, says Boyd-Bowman, \u201clatterly informed a lot of what the Bauhaus design aesthetic is\u201d. Its legacy today, he said, is that \u201cwe couldn\u2019t imagine the modern world without it ... their functional aesthetic is something we talk and think about all the time, down to the simple use of primary colours, without even realising it.\u201d But when the artists \u2013 stars of their day \u2013 were first appointed to the faculty, it was not as painters, but as pioneers with the job of stripping back all the conventions to build a new aesthetic that rejected the idea of a hierarchy governing what was most important in art. So Klee was put in charge of woodcuts, bookbinding and metalworks, and Kandinsky was tasked with teaching the most basic elements of design. While the show serves to emphasise the historical lack of interest there has been in German art in the UK, Boyd-Bowman said a shift in attitudes was taking place. \u201cIn the UK we are sadly undernourished in the sense that we have a very poor national collection of German art and that\u2019s something to do with the prejudice of collecting it after the first and second world wars,\u201d he said. \u201cAuctions are often the first chance people get to see these things in the UK.\u201d A symbiotic relationship between auctions and related shows, such as the recent hit exhibition at the Tate of the Bauhaus textiles designer Anni Albers, or the Barbican gallery\u2019s 2012 show Bauhaus: Art as Life, meant, Boyd-Bowman said: \u201cIf you\u2019ve had exhibitions that have revealed an artist or a movement to be so much more exciting and innovative and desirable, there\u2019s a natural desire to seek these works at auction.\u201d Most of the paintings for sale are from the collection of the late Dr Erika Pohl-Str\u00f6her, a businesswoman and geologist who was the granddaughter of Franz and Marie Str\u00f6her, who founded the hair products company Wella in Saxony in 1880. The Bauhaus movement was based in three German cities \u2013 Weimar, Dessau and finally Berlin - from its founding in 1919 until its closure under pressure by the Nazis in 1933. Its members emigrated across the world, spreading its principles from Israel to India. Tickets for the auction are available by emailing: ImpressionistTickets@sothebys.com",

And meanwhile, over the aisle, the tensions and bad blood in the Labour party are there for all to see. Parliament is angry, tensions are running high \u2013 and that\u2019s a problem not just for now, and the fate of Theresa May\u2019s deal, but also for the longer term.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/14/conservatives-react-angrily-to-defeat-of-mays-brexit-plan\">Conservatives react angrily to defeat of May's Brexit plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But first to the present, and yesterday\u2019s shenanigans in parliament. Once again, after another couple of days of debate and deliberation, nothing much has changed, albeit that the signs of tempers fraying and party unity being stretched to pretty much breaking point were there for all to see. Oh, and the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/14/conservatives-react-angrily-to-defeat-of-mays-brexit-plan\" title=\"\">lost another vote</a> \u2013 its 10th. Though, apart from the embarrassment, and the fact that the EU may begin to wonder if May can ever get anything over the line, this has absolutely no legal significance.</p> <p>Everyone is playing a waiting game. Downing Street calculates its best chance of passing its deal lies in increasing its no-deal preparations, and terrifying parliament into supporting the prime minister. Meanwhile, hardcore Brexiters welcome the sound of the ticking clock running down towards no deal. And, finally, those in favour of another referendum figure that, ultimately, their chances of victory are maximised if they wait until the prime minister\u2019s deal dies before making their move. Their only hope, the People\u2019s Vote campaign admits, lies in presenting their colleagues with a choice between no deal and no Brexit.</p> <p>So what now? Well, now we enter the genuinely crucial phase. In two weeks\u2019 time, MPs will actually have to eat their greens and decide on something. It is now established that for those who fear no deal, the next series of votes, scheduled for 27 February, is the key moment. Even the government now privately admits that at that point amendments such as that sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/feb/12/brexit-latest-news-developmens-mays-statment-mps-need-to-hold-our-nerve-may-to-tell-mps-as-leadsom-hints-uk-softening-call-for-deal-to-be-rewritten-politics-live?page=with:block-5c6307dce4b042feedcbc84b#block-5c6307dce4b042feedcbc84b\" title=\"\">Yvette Cooper</a> and Oliver Letwin, which seeks to prevent a no-deal outcome, are likely to garner enough support.</p> <p>If the Cooper-Letwin amendment passes, it guarantees parliamentary time for a debate on the Cooper-Letwin bill, which will force the prime minister to allow a choice between either no deal or an extension to the article 50 process.</p> <p>Other possible amendments may seek to force a series of \u201cindicative votes\u201d. MPs may be provided with a suite of alternatives on which to vote, providing (at long, long last) some idea of which possible outcomes they prefer more than others.</p> <p>Because, ultimately, a choice needs to be made, and yesterday\u2019s cancelled Valentine\u2019s dinners brought us no closer to it. The UK will either leave the EU with a deal, leave the EU without one, or not leave at all.</p> <p>The key question is which of these alternatives will be taken off the table first. If no deal is delayed (which is all that parliament can do in the absence of agreement on an alternative) it may hinder the prime minister\u2019s chances of scaring MPs into voting for her deal, although that would simply mean we\u2019re delaying the moment of choice.</p> <p>Either way, 27 February looks increasingly like a genuine moment of truth. Remainer cabinet ministers who have threatened to resign if no deal looks likely will have to choose whether they are just mouth or have trousers too. Labour MPs will need to decide whether their patience with their leadership is finite.</p> <p>And Downing Street, too, will face a difficult decision. The risk of the Cooper-Letwin bill passing is that the rug will be pulled from under the prime minister\u2019s strategy. Currently, the government can obfuscate. The Brexit secretary can stand up and strongly hint that the government will pursue no deal. Meanwhile the lead Brexit negotiator can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/13/brexit-minister-downplays-article-50-extension\" title=\"\">loudly state in a Brussels bar</a> that the government will tack to an extension. An extension would change the balance of options, and the prime minister would be forced to choose. May might have to secure some concessions from the EU before 27 February, or face running out of road.</p> <p>So, once again, we have a two-week buildup to a parliamentary showdown, but this time it may actually be one that matters. However the one thing that has become clear is that whatever our parliamentarians do, they will do it grudgingly. No one likes the deal. Relatively few favour a referendum, and virtually no one genuinely thinks no deal is a desirable outcome.</p> <p>Which means that, whatever happens, this will not have been a healing process. Rather, MPs will emerge dissatisfied with whatever has happened, claiming not to have supported it and laying the groundwork for battle to resume as the debate over our future relationship with the EU commences in earnest. Oh joy.</p> <p>\u2022 Anand Menon is director of UK in a Changing Europe and professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King\u2019s College London</p>",

      "bodyText": "So the ERG does it again, and scuppers the prime minister\u2019s plans. Anna Soubry emerged from the chamber last night visibly enraged and talking of a complete lack of leadership. And meanwhile, over the aisle, the tensions and bad blood in the Labour party are there for all to see. Parliament is angry, tensions are running high \u2013 and that\u2019s a problem not just for now, and the fate of Theresa May\u2019s deal, but also for the longer term. But first to the present, and yesterday\u2019s shenanigans in parliament. Once again, after another couple of days of debate and deliberation, nothing much has changed, albeit that the signs of tempers fraying and party unity being stretched to pretty much breaking point were there for all to see. Oh, and the government lost another vote \u2013 its 10th. Though, apart from the embarrassment, and the fact that the EU may begin to wonder if May can ever get anything over the line, this has absolutely no legal significance. Everyone is playing a waiting game. Downing Street calculates its best chance of passing its deal lies in increasing its no-deal preparations, and terrifying parliament into supporting the prime minister. Meanwhile, hardcore Brexiters welcome the sound of the ticking clock running down towards no deal. And, finally, those in favour of another referendum figure that, ultimately, their chances of victory are maximised if they wait until the prime minister\u2019s deal dies before making their move. Their only hope, the People\u2019s Vote campaign admits, lies in presenting their colleagues with a choice between no deal and no Brexit. So what now? Well, now we enter the genuinely crucial phase. In two weeks\u2019 time, MPs will actually have to eat their greens and decide on something. It is now established that for those who fear no deal, the next series of votes, scheduled for 27 February, is the key moment. Even the government now privately admits that at that point amendments such as that sponsored by Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin, which seeks to prevent a no-deal outcome, are likely to garner enough support. If the Cooper-Letwin amendment passes, it guarantees parliamentary time for a debate on the Cooper-Letwin bill, which will force the prime minister to allow a choice between either no deal or an extension to the article 50 process. Other possible amendments may seek to force a series of \u201cindicative votes\u201d. MPs may be provided with a suite of alternatives on which to vote, providing (at long, long last) some idea of which possible outcomes they prefer more than others. Because, ultimately, a choice needs to be made, and yesterday\u2019s cancelled Valentine\u2019s dinners brought us no closer to it. The UK will either leave the EU with a deal, leave the EU without one, or not leave at all. The key question is which of these alternatives will be taken off the table first. If no deal is delayed (which is all that parliament can do in the absence of agreement on an alternative) it may hinder the prime minister\u2019s chances of scaring MPs into voting for her deal, although that would simply mean we\u2019re delaying the moment of choice. Either way, 27 February looks increasingly like a genuine moment of truth. Remainer cabinet ministers who have threatened to resign if no deal looks likely will have to choose whether they are just mouth or have trousers too. Labour MPs will need to decide whether their patience with their leadership is finite. And Downing Street, too, will face a difficult decision. The risk of the Cooper-Letwin bill passing is that the rug will be pulled from under the prime minister\u2019s strategy. Currently, the government can obfuscate. The Brexit secretary can stand up and strongly hint that the government will pursue no deal. Meanwhile the lead Brexit negotiator can loudly state in a Brussels bar that the government will tack to an extension. An extension would change the balance of options, and the prime minister would be forced to choose. May might have to secure some concessions from the EU before 27 February, or face running out of road. So, once again, we have a two-week buildup to a parliamentary showdown, but this time it may actually be one that matters. However the one thing that has become clear is that whatever our parliamentarians do, they will do it grudgingly. No one likes the deal. Relatively few favour a referendum, and virtually no one genuinely thinks no deal is a desirable outcome. Which means that, whatever happens, this will not have been a healing process. Rather, MPs will emerge dissatisfied with whatever has happened, claiming not to have supported it and laying the groundwork for battle to resume as the debate over our future relationship with the EU commences in earnest. Oh joy. \u2022 Anand Menon is director of UK in a Changing Europe and professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King\u2019s College London",

Both parents were of mixed race.

Nickelsonthedime, from Kayley Woollacott\u2019s stable, was declared for the last race at Fakenham and would almost certainly have set off as the favourite. The five-year-old will be staying at home, however, because he is one of 23 horses owned by the Layezy Racing Owners Club, whose founder, Mike Stanley, filed for bankruptcy earlier this week. The Rules of Racing make it clear that \u201cinsolvent individuals or entities are not permitted to own and run racehorses\u201d, and all 23 horses have been barred from running until further notice. The insolvency firm Duff &amp; Phelps has been appointed to oversee the winding up of Stanley\u2019s operations, and is currently \u201cstarting the process of realising assets and continuing to obtain investor claims\u201d, according to a statement on Thursday. The Club\u2019s 23 horses will, presumably, be sold at some stage but its shareholders seem unlikely to get much of a return, if any. The Layezy Racing Club, however, appears to be quite a small element of a much bigger story, since Stanley\u2019s main concern in founding it was to advertise his Layezy Racing betting syndicate, which is also in the process of being wound up. In recent years, betting syndicates have become an increasingly popular way for smaller punters to play the gambling markets and feel that they are doing so alongside the big hitters. The Tote\u2019s weekly Scoop6 bet, for instance, has a minimum stake of \u00a32 per line, which means that picking just two horses in five of the legs and three in another adds up to a total stake of almost \u00a3200. A syndicate will offer its customers the chance to put their money into a much bigger perm, effectively betting at a few pence per line rather than the \u00a32 minimum, with the promise that its expert form students will do their best to find a winning combination. The Layezy Racing betting syndicate made an offer along similar lines, and it appears to have tempted hundreds, if not thousands, of people to \u201cinvest\u201d. Instead, the whole operation has now collapsed into bankruptcy and stories are already starting to emerge of punters who handed over their life savings or pension fund. One estimate of the total sum that may have been swallowed up by Layezy Racing is \u00a370m. How much of that money, if any, was actually placed into the betting markets remains to be seen. Betting in the United Kingdom, though, is legal and regulated, and Layezy Racing promoted itself as a betting syndicate, so surely there must have been a regulator somewhere taking at least some interest in how it conducted its operations? Yet it seems that this is not the case. The Gambling Commission would seem to be the obvious first port of call, but the statutory body with a mission statement which includes the aim of ensuring that gambling \u201cis conducted in a fair and open way\u201d seems to feel that betting syndicates are none of its business. The Guardian has seen an email sent by the Gambling Commission to a punter who had asked whether money invested in a syndicate had any legal protection. In its response, the Commission makes it clear that, in its view, the regulator\u2019s writ does not run to syndicates. \u201cAs we do not regulate syndicates,\u201d it says, \u201cany issues that you may have would be considered a civil matter. If the syndicate had won but refused to pay you your share then the only way to proceed would be through the courts.\u201d The view at the Commission seems to be that a bet is only a bet if the customer has some say in the selections. If you choose instead to give money to a syndicate which picks the horses on your behalf, that counts as an investment (which would, presumably, be the responsibility of the Financial Conduct Authority).

The NHS long-term plan, unveiled in January, aims to deliver the \u201ctriple integration\u201d of primary and hospital care, physical and mental health services and health with social care. From councils\u2019 point of view, this is a unique opportunity to fix one of the big flaws in the way the NHS was set up in 1948, with a centralised service telling local services what to do, rather than focusing on the needs of local communities. With NHS community and mental health services \u2013 especially mental health care for children and adolescents \u2013 set to be the big winners in the scramble for funding for at least the next five years, local NHS services and councils have a chance to focus on tackling the root causes of physical and mental illness in their area. The NHS plan wisely avoids setting out precisely how this local collaboration should happen, putting the onus on local leaders to find ways to work together. Some are struggling. A mix of honest policy differences and less laudable clashes of ego have caused serious disputes in some parts of the country. As the Heath Service Journal reports, Luton borough council has quit the Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes integrated care system (these are the bodies being set up across England to integrate services), alleging it has been sidelined. Two other councils had previously threatened to quit the same organisation. Nottingham city council has suspended its involvement in the integrated care system covering Nottinghamshire, claiming a lack of local accountability. Relations are fraught in several other parts of the country. Like Brexit negotiations in miniature, some people would prefer to walk away, or refuse to budge while accusing the other side of intransigence, rather than take on the hard graft of arguing through difficulties to find a solution. Meanwhile the growing dispute over the future of public health services threatens to undermine the most positive part of the infamous 2013 NHS reforms \u2013 moving responsibility for public health to local government. According to the King\u2019s Fund, government cuts meant councils\u2019 spending on public health services was 8% lower in 2017-18 than 2013-14. The cuts continue in the coming year. The big losers have been drug and alcohol services for both adults and children, sexual health services and smoking cessation. Without consulting local public health directors, the NHS plan proposed that the health service would take a bigger role in commissioning sexual health services, health visitors and school nurses. The Local Government Association highlights official data showing that many public health indicators are heading in the right direction, such as falling teenage pregnancies and abortions, continuing falls in smoking rates, less drug use and a steady decrease in suicides as the rate among men drops. The figures do not prove that local government is responsible for those falls, but they do at least demonstrate there has been good progress while councils have been in charge. As Jim McManus, director of public health at Hertfordshire county council, points out, local government\u2019s performance compares well with similar services commissioned by NHS England, such as prison health, immunisation and cervical and breast cancer screening. Public health doesn\u2019t need to be reorganised yet again, it just needs to be funded properly. Ripping it out of local government after just six years would harm services and undermine relationships between the NHS and councils just as they should be pulling together to deliver the ambitions of the long-term plan. And council leaders should have the confidence and commitment to remain full players in the leadership of local health and care services, no matter what the short-term difficulties. \u2022 Richard Vize is a public policy commentator and analyst",

The claim led to broad accusations of antisemitism from Democrats and Republicans.

      "bodyText": "Pro-Israel lobbyists and donors spent more than $22m on lobbying and campaign contributions during the 2018 election cycle. The same or similar Israel-aligned groups and donors have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in recent decades, and that money poured into American politics through a variety of channels, according to the non-profit, non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics. The CRP uses federal election records to track campaign finance spending and makes its data available on the OpenSecrets site. The Guardian examined campaign finance data after Muslim Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar ignited a controversy with two tweets claiming pro-Israel lobby money influenced American political policy and discourse. The claim led to broad accusations of antisemitism from Democrats and Republicans. Omar later apologized but also stood her ground when it came to highlighting the influence of lobbyists, comparing influential pro-Israel lobby group, the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) to the the National Rifle Association and the fossil fuel industry. The data examined by the Guardian suggests that the pro-Israel lobby is highly active and spends heavily to influence US policy, though at levels far below those of many big business sectors. \u201cI haven\u2019t observed many other countries that have a comparable level of activity, at least in domestic lobbying data,\u201d said Dan Auble, a senior researcher at CRP. Omar incorrectly suggested Aipac makes campaign contributions to candidates. However, records show it did spend about $3.5m lobbying during the 2018 election cycle. In total, pro-Israel lobbying groups spent about $5m in 2018, the highest tally since tracking began in 1998. Aipac spent the most of the lobbying groups, and is known for funding junket trips to Israel for freshman lawmakers and senators, as well as state legislators. Aipac also lobbied against the Iran nuclear deal in 2015 and supported the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal from the agreement. An Aipac spokesperson did not return requests for comment. Separately, pro-Israeli foreign agents registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which can include lobbyists working on behalf of the Israeli government, companies, political parties and other organizations spent about $46.3m in 2017 and 2018, behind only Japan and South Korea. However, only about $2.1m of that total funded political activity, while $44.2m was dedicated to tourism and other industries.

The nonpartisan NorPAC contributed $1.1m, while the Republican Jewish Coalition contributed about $502,000. J Street senior political adviser Ben Shnider didn\u2019t comment specifically on what the lobby gets in return for its investment, but said the high level of contributions to his lobby indicates support for a \u201cdiplomacy first Middle East policy\u201d. \u201cWhat that demonstrates is that there\u2019s momentum behind a pragmatic, pro-diplomacy, moderate approach to the Middle East, and to the Israel-Palestine issue,\u201d he said. The pro-Israel lobby\u2019s contributions reach a majority of US politicians. In 2018, it spent money on 269 representatives\u2019 and 57 senators\u2019 campaigns, and gave to Democrats at a two to one ratio.

      "body": "<p>I stood behind a worn shopping center outside of Crystal River, Florida, looking for the refuge where a hundred manatees were gathered for winter. I found them clustered in the emerald-colored spring, trying to enjoy a wedge of sunlight and avoid the hordes of people like me, boxing them in on kayaks and tour boats, leering over wooden decks. The nearby canals were lined with expensive homes and docks with jetskis. One manatee breached the water for a breath, and I could see the propeller scar on its back.</p> <p>2018 was the<a href=\"https://www.chronicleonline.com/news/local/second-worst-year-since-for-manatee-deaths-in-citrus/article_044265d6-0ad8-11e9-8491-efbf5e34ea00.html\"> second deadliest year </a>on record for manatees. Like many of our coastal species, they\u2019re vulnerable to habitat loss and warming seas, which are more hospitable to algal blooms and red tide. Science has given us the foresight we need to make decisions that will reduce the future suffering of other species and ourselves, but we don\u2019t heed it. Why?</p> <p><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/10/why-people-arent-motivated-to-address-climate-change\">Studies</a> show that humans don\u2019t respond well to abstract projections. We overvalue short-term benefits, such as driving SUVs, burning coal and building waterfront real estate. We choose these extravagances even though they impede beneficial long-term outcomes, such as saving threatened species, or reducing the intensity of climate change.</p> <p>Humans tend to respond to immediate threats and financial consequences \u2013 and coastal real estate, especially in Florida, may be on the cusp of delivering that harsh wake-up call. The peninsula has outsized exposure: nearly 2 million people live in coastal cities. On the list of the 20 urban areas in America that will suffer the most from rising seas, Florida has five: St Petersburg, Tampa, Miami, Miami Beach and Panama City. In 2016, <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/research/climate-change-underwater-homes-12890/\">Zillow</a> predicted that one out of eight homes in Florida would be underwater by 2100, a loss of $413bn in property.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"61ed2ea95bceae724e0cb3770c71f424d8155a2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61ed2ea95bceae724e0cb3770c71f424d8155a2f/0_0_5694_3800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A potential scenario of future sea level rise in South Beach, Miami, Florida, USA.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A potential scenario of future sea level rise in South Beach, Miami, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nickolay Lamm/Courtesy Climate Central</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I flew into Miami in early December and the risk was visibly apparent from the airplane window. Aerial views of Miami and South Beach show high density construction on flat, sandy slivers of land. A recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)<a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article207511429.html\"> predicts</a> Miami streets will flood every year by 2070.</p> <p>South Beach was vibrant and populated, with mega-yachts docked in front of luxury homes, sorbet-colored art deco-era hotels rising a block from the water, cafes misting customers on the sidewalks, neon signs flashing bright in the night sky. But I wondered: given the forecasts, why are people still building new condominiums?</p> <p>In Florida, you will see a bewildering mix of optimism, opportunism and denial in the real estate market: luxury condominiums going up in flood-prone South Beach, and property values <em><a href=\"https://keysweekly.com/42/house-hunting-the-market-vs-irma/\">rising</a></em> in the vulnerable Keys, post-Hurricane Irma. And though the House of Representatives passed a bill to require real estate agents to disclose flood risks, the Senate has not reviewed it, and a <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2018/01/02/475789.htm\">culture</a> of \u201csystemic, fraudulent nondisclosure\u201d persists in high flood risk areas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/24/us-south-climate-change\">Why people in the US south stay put in the face of climate change</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You will see the massive benefits of privilege, and the way it allows a homeowner, particularly a second home owner, to afford the risk. You will see emerging issues like Miami\u2019s climate gentrification, where previously low-income neighborhoods like Little Haiti are rising in value and under pressure from developers because of their higher ground, resulting in the displacement of people and place-based culture. Haitian playwright and bookstore owner Jan Mapou recently<a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/440734/libreri-mapou-qa-with-jan-mapou-little-haiti-book-festival/\"> told a reporter</a>: \u201cGentrification is coming forcefully: developers buying the major corners, raising the rents, forcing renters onto month-to-month leases \u2026 We\u2019re not against development or modernization \u2026 but respect the people living there, their culture, their history.\u201d</p> <p>I spoke with a developer who wanted to remain anonymous, given business interests. He told me that he\u2019s surprised that people are still buying, building and investing in coastal Florida. He estimated that a decade ago, only one in 10 buyers asked about the property elevation, or expressed concerns about rising seas. Today, nearly six of 10 ask and many decide not to buy in these same critical areas. \u201cI\u2019m worried we\u2019re one bad storm away from a rush for the exits,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>I sought input from the environmental community as well. \u201cReal estate is a huge economic driver here,\u201d Laura Geselbracht, a senior marine scientist with the Nature Conservancy, said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s at risk from sea level rise. People don\u2019t want to believe it. That\u2019s a normal human condition \u2013 suspension of belief.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not a millionaire and you own a property in a vulnerable area, it may be a wise decision to think about moving before the masses think about moving,\u201d Geselbracht said. She also owns waterfront property on a canal in Fort Lauderdale, and is deeply invested in her community, but has cautioned her child not to expect the same lifestyle in the future.</p> <p>She wonders why she doesn\u2019t see more people of means in south Florida buying electric cars, getting solar panels and living more sustainably. \u201cThe quicker we take action, the better. We\u2019ve got to be leaders so that we have a longer horizon of survival here,\u201d she said. When she\u2019s approached community leaders in the past, asking them to take steps toward sustainability, she often hears the same response: \u201cTechnology will solve it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/09/republicans-climate-change-conservatives-environmentalists-arkansas\">Not all environmentalists eat tofu: the hunters fighting climate change</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a high-stakes gamble. Consider innovative mitigation in action: raising roads, shoring up sea walls, adding pumps and drainage upgrades, beginning dredging projects, offering complex insurance structures. Proximity to these short-term solutions are not always pluses in a home buyer\u2019s column, but acute reminders of vulnerability.</p> <p>While Geselbracht is optimistic about developments like Orlando\u2019s zero emissions goal, and Miami\u2019s forward-looking <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article222651895.html\">Forever</a> bond, she\u2019s not ready to pin all her hopes on innovation. She also wonders about the fallacy of \u201csafe\u201d investments elsewhere. \u201cThere are air quality issues and forest fires out west, and extreme heat inland.\u201d</p> <p>I spoke with young farmers who recently decided to purchase a farm away from the coast. \u201cAs we looked for farmland to buy, we certainly thought hard about what the climate would be like in 10, 20, 30 years,\u201d one of the owners of <a href=\"https://www.tenmothersfarm.com/\">Ten Mothers Farm</a> told me. \u201cWe knew we didn\u2019t want to be near the coast, and we wondered whether even being in the south-east was a bad idea.

      "bodyText": "I stood behind a worn shopping center outside of Crystal River, Florida, looking for the refuge where a hundred manatees were gathered for winter. I found them clustered in the emerald-colored spring, trying to enjoy a wedge of sunlight and avoid the hordes of people like me, boxing them in on kayaks and tour boats, leering over wooden decks. The nearby canals were lined with expensive homes and docks with jetskis. One manatee breached the water for a breath, and I could see the propeller scar on its back. 2018 was the second deadliest year on record for manatees. Like many of our coastal species, they\u2019re vulnerable to habitat loss and warming seas, which are more hospitable to algal blooms and red tide. Science has given us the foresight we need to make decisions that will reduce the future suffering of other species and ourselves, but we don\u2019t heed it. Why? Studies show that humans don\u2019t respond well to abstract projections. We overvalue short-term benefits, such as driving SUVs, burning coal and building waterfront real estate. We choose these extravagances even though they impede beneficial long-term outcomes, such as saving threatened species, or reducing the intensity of climate change. Humans tend to respond to immediate threats and financial consequences \u2013 and coastal real estate, especially in Florida, may be on the cusp of delivering that harsh wake-up call. The peninsula has outsized exposure: nearly 2 million people live in coastal cities. On the list of the 20 urban areas in America that will suffer the most from rising seas, Florida has five: St Petersburg, Tampa, Miami, Miami Beach and Panama City. In 2016, Zillow predicted that one out of eight homes in Florida would be underwater by 2100, a loss of $413bn in property. I flew into Miami in early December and the risk was visibly apparent from the airplane window. Aerial views of Miami and South Beach show high density construction on flat, sandy slivers of land. A recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts Miami streets will flood every year by 2070. South Beach was vibrant and populated, with mega-yachts docked in front of luxury homes, sorbet-colored art deco-era hotels rising a block from the water, cafes misting customers on the sidewalks, neon signs flashing bright in the night sky. But I wondered: given the forecasts, why are people still building new condominiums? In Florida, you will see a bewildering mix of optimism, opportunism and denial in the real estate market: luxury condominiums going up in flood-prone South Beach, and property values rising in the vulnerable Keys, post-Hurricane Irma. And though the House of Representatives passed a bill to require real estate agents to disclose flood risks, the Senate has not reviewed it, and a culture of \u201csystemic, fraudulent nondisclosure\u201d persists in high flood risk areas. You will see the massive benefits of privilege, and the way it allows a homeowner, particularly a second home owner, to afford the risk. You will see emerging issues like Miami\u2019s climate gentrification, where previously low-income neighborhoods like Little Haiti are rising in value and under pressure from developers because of their higher ground, resulting in the displacement of people and place-based culture. Haitian playwright and bookstore owner Jan Mapou recently told a reporter: \u201cGentrification is coming forcefully: developers buying the major corners, raising the rents, forcing renters onto month-to-month leases \u2026 We\u2019re not against development or modernization \u2026 but respect the people living there, their culture, their history.\u201d I spoke with a developer who wanted to remain anonymous, given business interests. He told me that he\u2019s surprised that people are still buying, building and investing in coastal Florida. He estimated that a decade ago, only one in 10 buyers asked about the property elevation, or expressed concerns about rising seas. Today, nearly six of 10 ask and many decide not to buy in these same critical areas. \u201cI\u2019m worried we\u2019re one bad storm away from a rush for the exits,\u201d he told me. I sought input from the environmental community as well. \u201cReal estate is a huge economic driver here,\u201d Laura Geselbracht, a senior marine scientist with the Nature Conservancy, said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s at risk from sea level rise. People don\u2019t want to believe it. That\u2019s a normal human condition \u2013 suspension of belief. \u201cIf you\u2019re not a millionaire and you own a property in a vulnerable area, it may be a wise decision to think about moving before the masses think about moving,\u201d Geselbracht said. She also owns waterfront property on a canal in Fort Lauderdale, and is deeply invested in her community, but has cautioned her child not to expect the same lifestyle in the future. She wonders why she doesn\u2019t see more people of means in south Florida buying electric cars, getting solar panels and living more sustainably. \u201cThe quicker we take action, the better. We\u2019ve got to be leaders so that we have a longer horizon of survival here,\u201d she said. When she\u2019s approached community leaders in the past, asking them to take steps toward sustainability, she often hears the same response: \u201cTechnology will solve it.\u201d It\u2019s a high-stakes gamble. Consider innovative mitigation in action: raising roads, shoring up sea walls, adding pumps and drainage upgrades, beginning dredging projects, offering complex insurance structures. Proximity to these short-term solutions are not always pluses in a home buyer\u2019s column, but acute reminders of vulnerability. While Geselbracht is optimistic about developments like Orlando\u2019s zero emissions goal, and Miami\u2019s forward-looking Forever bond, she\u2019s not ready to pin all her hopes on innovation. She also wonders about the fallacy of \u201csafe\u201d investments elsewhere. \u201cThere are air quality issues and forest fires out west, and extreme heat inland.\u201d I spoke with young farmers who recently decided to purchase a farm away from the coast. \u201cAs we looked for farmland to buy, we certainly thought hard about what the climate would be like in 10, 20, 30 years,\u201d one of the owners of Ten Mothers Farm told me. \u201cWe knew we didn\u2019t want to be near the coast, and we wondered whether even being in the south-east was a bad idea. Ultimately we decided that the most important thing was to be in a community that\u2019s supportive and that we believe will be resilient.\u201d While baby boomers may be slow to adjust spending behavior to climate change, the Florida developer told me, millennials will not, and that shift will likely impact the market in the decade to come. I grew up in two eastern North Carolina towns, Rocky Mount and Atlantic Beach, that have been bludgeoned by hurricanes. There, friends have real estate that falls into an increasingly common, and expensive, pattern: flood, repair, rebuild. Many are locked into this expensive, emotionally draining pattern because they can\u2019t sell their homes, which have been flooded multiple times.

They also outlined how this helped generate metrics used to enhance the tour, in a post that has since been removed. </p> <p>It\u2019s unclear what exactly happened with the data next. A security contractor told Rolling Stone that the data was sent to a central command team in Nashville to be checked against a database of known Swift stalkers.

ISM Connect uses \u201csmart screens\u201d to simultaneously enhance security, advertise and collect demographic data for brands. \u201cWhen fans attend events they are their most passionate selves, and it is at these pinnacle and personal moments that they are open to new ideas\u201d the company says on its website. \u201cOur products enhance and ensure security at immense and highly visible events, while providing advertisers with a seamless, immersive platform to connect to their brand advocates.\u201d At Swift\u2019s shows, ISM installed cameras behind kiosks marked as \u201cselfie stations\u201d, drawing concert-goers in with Swift trivia and behind the scenes footage. Their hidden cameras scanned the facial features of fans interacting with the screens, the company explained in a series of posts on its website. They also outlined how this helped generate metrics used to enhance the tour, in a post that has since been removed. It\u2019s unclear what exactly happened with the data next. A security contractor told Rolling Stone that the data was sent to a central command team in Nashville to be checked against a database of known Swift stalkers. The Guardian has not independently confirmed the report. Rolling Stone\u2019s source could not be reached for comment, despite several attempts. But ISM\u2019s trademark for its \u201cFanGuard\u201d technology confirms it uses \u201cfacial recognition to identify persons of interest for security purposes\u201d, and includes protections for the \u201cdesign and development of electronic data security systems\u201d. And its website says, it uses those same smart screens to deliver demographic information and metrics to help educate promotors on how best to direct their marketing efforts. Both ISM and Swift\u2019s team declined to provide further details on how the data was used. ISM\u2019s \u201cdata metric smart cameras\u201d have been used at Nascar tracks, Daytona Beach\u2019s luxury mall and at the Redskins\u2019 FedEx field. Soon they will be at Minor League Baseball stadiums, and ISM hopes to integrate them into \u201csmart cities\u201d. Already, the company\u2019s screens have captured engagement and demographic data on over 110 million event-goers at more than 100 venues, according to their website. Like the technology itself, the industry is expanding rapidly as it becomes a profitable tool for retail and marketing companies. In the next two years, facial recognition is expected to become a $9.6bn market, according to a 2015 report from Allied Research. But regulation in the burgeoning industry has failed to keep pace. Companies are expected to police themselves, and aren\u2019t hold to account for how they collect, use, and store the data. Privacy advocates, researchers, and industry experts have all begun to sound the alarm about the lack of governmental oversight with this type of technology and the stealthy way it can be used to collect data on crowds of people. And, they warn, the industry is growing exponentially, becoming far more widely used than most people realize. ISM says on its website that it doesn\u2019t keep the information it collects, and that biometric cameras don\u2019t produce an actual, identifiable image of someone. The company also emphasizes that signs inform crowds that they \u201cmight be filmed\u201d. More than half of all American adults have had their likeness cataloged in databases used for facial recognition matching, according to a 2016 Georgetown law study, and a quarter of law enforcement agencies across the country have access to those databases. Mass surveillance has only gotten more pervasive since then, said Clare Garvie, a senior associate at the center on privacy and technology and one of the authors on the study. \u201cWe knew when we were writing in late 2016 that facial recognition technology would only become more common,\u201d she said, adding that advancements have made it even easier for law enforcement agencies or companies to collect real-time data on crowds of people without their knowledge. \u201cIt is going to become more widespread and more advanced, especially in the absence of common sense legislation governing how it can and more importantly \u2013 how it can\u2019t \u2013 be used,\u201d she said. \u201cA company such as Walmart, or Saks Fifth Avenue, or a venue or a law enforcement agency can adopt this technology and provide no notice to the public.\u201d \u201cIf every shopping mall, and baseball game, and convenient store is tracking every move, knows who you are, and recording what you are doing and buying and that\u2019s all being sent to some corporate repository, that could still have serious consequences and change what it feels like to live in America\u201d the American Civil Liberty Union\u2019s (ACLU) senior policy analyst Jay Stanley told the Guardian in December. Illinois is the only state with laws requiring companies and agencies to have opt-in consent before they can collect biometric information. It\u2019s also the only state mentioned by ISM Connect where it doesn\u2019t offer its technology. In January, San Francisco introduced legislation that would make it the first city in the country to ban its police department from using the technology. In the rest of the country, companies have been left to police themselves \u2013 and many don\u2019t consider it to be a problem. Only a quarter of Americans believe facial recognition technology should be regulated or restricted by the government, a recent survey from the Center for Data Innovation found. The number drops even more when public safety is cast as a tradeoff. Garvie says that\u2019s likely because Americans perceive the technology largely as a convenience tool. It makes it easy to tag friends in photos on Facebook or speed through lines at TSA checkpoints. Kelly Gates, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, and author of Our Biometric Future, a book on facial recognition and the culture of surveillance, says this attitude may come at a price. \u201cPeople\u2019s lives \u2013 everything we do \u2013 is online,\u201d she said. \u201cSo much data is collected all the time and automation and machine learning algorithms are coming up with ways to do things with that data, and it will affect our lives going forward.\u201d Mary Haskett, the co-founder of the facial recognition company Blink Identity, compared the public\u2019s lack of understanding of the impact of facial recognition technology to Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal. \u201c[Users] didn\u2019t realize how much in-depth information Facebook had, and more importantly how that information was being used to manipulate them,\u201d she said. Only now, she added, these issues are quickly making their way into the physical world. Haskett spent over a decade working for the US Department of Defense doing what she describes as \u201clarge scale national identity systems\u201d and other programs \u201cinstalled into foreign governments\u201d. But these days, development of the tech is increasingly aimed at consumers. \u201cThe problem is that what the technology can do is far more invasive and personal than people realize, and this will only get worse as AI technology continues to grow in capability.\u201d",

He said if Theresa May refused to do that, ministers would face a \u201cvery difficult choice\u201d, and unless MPs worked together to prevent no deal happening, it could still happen. \u201cIn the end it could be so chaotic it might even happen by accident.\u201d He told BBC Radio 4 Today\u2019s programme: \u201cThe irony of all this is that most of us in the Conservative party are sufficiently united to want to try to operate a coherent government.

And so there are doomy goth-disco songs such as The Animals, Paper Highways and Horrorscope \u2013 the latter track almost as heavy as Nine Inch Nails in its serrated swagger \u2013 with their foreboding lyrics that suggest doomsdays, dystopias and \u201csleepwalking into the fire\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible to hear echoes of synth-pop bands they\u2019ve influenced, too, on sparkling kosmische-pop opener Until the Fire (School of Seven Bells) and The Island (Chvrches). Deadzone, meanwhile, with its stabby synths, trance-like euphoria and catchy-as-hell chorus, could easily have been sung by any chart pop star of the last few years. You\u2019ve Changed is another standout, wearing its Gary Numan-isms on its sleeve.</p> <p>This album was largely crowdfunded via Pledge Music and was written remotely, from places as far flung as Chicago and S\u00e3o Paulo, where some members are now based, but it is seductively cohesive, glazed in experience. \u201cThis world keeps turning,\u201d they sing on Paper Highways.

      "bodyText": "If any band was going to bounce back from years of acrimonious hiatus with a soundtrack to our troubled times, Ladytron seemed unlikely contenders. Yes, that Ladytron, from Liverpool, whose heavy-lidded, robo-cool vocals defined the electroclash movement of the early 2000s and who haven\u2019t released anything since 2011. And yet their eponymous return is an immersive, invigorating and convincingly brooding stomp of disenfranchisement. Perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be surprising for a band whose breakout hit was the glassy-eyed electro evisceration Destroy Everything You Touch. And so there are doomy goth-disco songs such as The Animals, Paper Highways and Horrorscope \u2013 the latter track almost as heavy as Nine Inch Nails in its serrated swagger \u2013 with their foreboding lyrics that suggest doomsdays, dystopias and \u201csleepwalking into the fire\u201d. It\u2019s possible to hear echoes of synth-pop bands they\u2019ve influenced, too, on sparkling kosmische-pop opener Until the Fire (School of Seven Bells) and The Island (Chvrches). Deadzone, meanwhile, with its stabby synths, trance-like euphoria and catchy-as-hell chorus, could easily have been sung by any chart pop star of the last few years. You\u2019ve Changed is another standout, wearing its Gary Numan-isms on its sleeve. This album was largely crowdfunded via Pledge Music and was written remotely, from places as far flung as Chicago and S\u00e3o Paulo, where some members are now based, but it is seductively cohesive, glazed in experience. \u201cThis world keeps turning,\u201d they sing on Paper Highways. Better so with Ladytron in it.",

I can see why others enjoy his novels, but I just couldn\u2019t hack them. The book that is most overrated I\u2019m a big fan of Daniel Defoe, but Robinson Crusoe\u2019s supremacy has always puzzled me, because while I admire the joinery, it bores me. Captain Singleton, on the other hand, is where we get all our pirate lore. Written in the golden era of Anglo-Saxon piracy, it\u2019s a sort of \u201cEnglish Psycho\u201d, and you can\u2019t doubt that Defoe had some first-hand accounts. Robert Louis Stevenson stole it all here. The book that changed my life Hasn\u2019t happened yet. My guilty pleasures I have some embarrassing choices when it comes to music and film, but not with writing. I can\u2019t abide drivel or prefab on the page. My earliest reading memory Tintin. The book I give as a gift I often hand out copies of Charles Willeford. I feel he is one of the greatest American writers of the last century and woefully underappreciated both here and in the US. Either The Burnt Orange Heresy or Miami Blues. \u2022 Tibor Fischer\u2019s How to Rule the World is out in paperback (Corsair).",

He\u2019s done an hour\u2019s recce, his hands are numb and he\u2019s not seen any birds of prey. He explains we will walk half a mile to <a href=\"https://www.birdguides.com/sites/europe/britain-ireland/britain/england/norfolk/stubb-mill-hickling/\" title=\"\">Stubb Mill</a>, a disused wind-pump, and look out for marsh harriers, hen harriers, barn owls and maybe even Britain\u2019s tallest bird, the crane, which was once extinct in this country but last year enjoyed its best breeding year since the 17th century after flying back into this watery corner of eastern England.</p> <p>With the light fading, we squelch along a muddy track. Amazingly, it has stopped raining. One of my seven-year-old twins runs ahead, relishing the fresh air after a day indoors, my five-year-old is busy testing my binoculars and the other twin is still moaning, but her puddle-sploshing is definitely a secret pleasure.</p> <p>We pause and survey flooded meadows. A flock of lapwing swoop against the wintery sky, a grey heron stands motionless on one leg and a Chinese water deer jinks into the reeds. And in the distance, a marsh harrier.</p> <p>We live nearby and are familiar with marsh harriers but this large, slender-winged bird is rarer than a golden eagle in Britain. It flies low over the reedbeds, into the wind, deliberately slowing its flight so it can eyeball voles cowering in the reeds. I have a basic nature knowledge but there is always more to learn, and picking up tips from other enthusiasts, in the field, is much the quickest and nicest way to learn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"167912af8bb05e54da9729ecfd8792f9d06280c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/167912af8bb05e54da9729ecfd8792f9d06280c6/682_147_3015_1809/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A hen harrier spots its prey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A hen harrier spots its prey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raymond Hennessy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beyond the mill, we stop on a raised flood bank and train binoculars on the marshes beyond. At dusk in winter, up to 100 marsh harriers roost for the night in scrubby hawthorn dotted through these flatlands. We spy a buzzard and watch more than a dozen marsh harriers. Then, with an eccentric croak, two cranes flop on to the marshes. They remind me of ornamental peacocks as they strut through the undergrowth with great majesty.</p> <p>As if commanded by the cranes, the sun appears, turning the marshes golden, and the huge skies pink as we return to the visitor centre, numb with cold but glowing; and in a much calmer, but also ebullient, state of mind. At home that evening, all three children fall sleep instantly, another of the many benefits of a cold, wild walk.<br>\u2022 <em>Norfolk Wildlife Trust runs regular guided walks at reserves including Hickling and Cley next the</em><em> Sea, \u00a33.50\u2013\u00a35pp</em><em>, <a href=\"https://www.norfolkwildlifetrust.org.uk/whats-on/all-events\" title=\"\">norfolkwildlifetrust.org.uk</a><br></em><strong>Patrick Barkham</strong></p> <h2><strong>The Gobbins Coastal Path, County Antrim</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a9828c6e7b565f9d41e537eb5a090ef0c28656f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9828c6e7b565f9d41e537eb5a090ef0c28656f3/0_323_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Gobbins Cliff Path walkway.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Gobbins Cliff Path walkway.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Adventurous older kids will love the spectacular <a href=\"http://www.thegobbinscliffpath.com/\" title=\"\">Gobbins Coastal Path</a>, a guided hike along a steep, narrow trail hugging the cliff face at Islandmagee, County Antrim.

      "bodyText": "Tracking rare birds of prey, Norfolk Small children will never rapturously welcome the announcement of an activity they\u2019ve never done before. Especially if it involves the dreaded word \u201cwalk\u201d \u2013 and definitely not when temperatures are close to freezing on a day of constant rain. Even I quail a little when I phone the visitor centre at Hickling Broad and they cheerily announce that the Raptor Roost Walk \u2013 a guided twilight stroll in search of rare birds of prey \u2013 is going ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s going to stop raining,\u201d I lie to my mutinous children on the drive to Hickling, a national nature reserve well-suited to a wet day: it contains the largest reedbed in England and the largest of the Norfolk Broads\u2019 freshwater lakes. I try to distract the kids by creating great curtains of brown water as I drive along the flooded roads. Our group of a dozen gathers at the visitor centre and our leader, Richard, is careful not to overhype our prospects. He\u2019s done an hour\u2019s recce, his hands are numb and he\u2019s not seen any birds of prey. He explains we will walk half a mile to Stubb Mill, a disused wind-pump, and look out for marsh harriers, hen harriers, barn owls and maybe even Britain\u2019s tallest bird, the crane, which was once extinct in this country but last year enjoyed its best breeding year since the 17th century after flying back into this watery corner of eastern England. With the light fading, we squelch along a muddy track. Amazingly, it has stopped raining. One of my seven-year-old twins runs ahead, relishing the fresh air after a day indoors, my five-year-old is busy testing my binoculars and the other twin is still moaning, but her puddle-sploshing is definitely a secret pleasure. We pause and survey flooded meadows. A flock of lapwing swoop against the wintery sky, a grey heron stands motionless on one leg and a Chinese water deer jinks into the reeds. And in the distance, a marsh harrier. We live nearby and are familiar with marsh harriers but this large, slender-winged bird is rarer than a golden eagle in Britain. It flies low over the reedbeds, into the wind, deliberately slowing its flight so it can eyeball voles cowering in the reeds. I have a basic nature knowledge but there is always more to learn, and picking up tips from other enthusiasts, in the field, is much the quickest and nicest way to learn. Beyond the mill, we stop on a raised flood bank and train binoculars on the marshes beyond. At dusk in winter, up to 100 marsh harriers roost for the night in scrubby hawthorn dotted through these flatlands. We spy a buzzard and watch more than a dozen marsh harriers. Then, with an eccentric croak, two cranes flop on to the marshes. They remind me of ornamental peacocks as they strut through the undergrowth with great majesty. As if commanded by the cranes, the sun appears, turning the marshes golden, and the huge skies pink as we return to the visitor centre, numb with cold but glowing; and in a much calmer, but also ebullient, state of mind. At home that evening, all three children fall sleep instantly, another of the many benefits of a cold, wild walk. \u2022 Norfolk Wildlife Trust runs regular guided walks at reserves including Hickling and Cley next the Sea, \u00a33.50\u2013\u00a35pp, norfolkwildlifetrust.org.uk Patrick Barkham The Gobbins Coastal Path, County Antrim Adventurous older kids will love the spectacular Gobbins Coastal Path, a guided hike along a steep, narrow trail hugging the cliff face at Islandmagee, County Antrim. The path was built in 1902, and this modern version opened in 2015. The strenuous 2\u00bd-hour trail includes bridges, tunnels and caves, with seabirds nesting in the cliffs above and the sea crashing against the rocks not far below. Guides recount the history of the first path\u2019s construction and tell tales of local smugglers; dolphins are sometimes spotted off the coast.

She talked about her impending death in a matter-of-fact way, right down to parking arrangements for the funeral. She had processed it and, with characteristic fortitude, decided she would rather live with what was coming than die from what she had. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to die,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019ve got a pretty good idea when I\u2019m going to die and you don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>And so it was that we sat, on an unseasonably warm October afternoon with her husband, Bill Mayblin, on her patio in north London, a couple of miles from where she grew up, laughing as our conversation kept bumping up against her mortality.

I first met Andrea at a Guardian summer party in 1999. She was standing on her own when I approached her and told her I was a great admirer of her first two books. She smiled and withdrew slightly, mistaking me for either a stalker or a fantasist. It took all my powers of persuasion to get her to agree to have lunch with me. \u201cI was deeply, deeply suspicious,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI\u2019d never had anybody do that to me before.\u201d</p> <p>Over the years, we became close friends. She was like an older sister to me: protective, encouraging, generous, gently chiding, affectionately mocking, always loving. When I lived in America, I often stayed with her and Bill, who are godparents to my daughter, on my visits to London, and she would make sure the fridge was stocked with all the things I loved \u2013 invariably fattening or alcohol-related \u2013 which she would then tease me about.</p> <p>We shared a sense of humour \u2013 raucous, playful and occasionally bizarre \u2013 and a politics that was rooted in anti-racism, equality and internationalism. After I wrote a column defending the right of black and brown Parisian youth to take to the streets against racist policing, she emailed her support. \u201cI fear that you may need to watch your back more than usual,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou know where I am if you need me.\u201d</p> <p>But our connection was primarily rooted in our experiences as black writers from working-class backgrounds who were ambitious about our work but deeply sceptical about the culture of the professions we had chosen and bloody-minded about our desire to define achievement on our own terms.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/18/the-long-song-review-a-sharp-painful-look-at-the-last-days-of-slavery\">The Long Song review \u2013 a sharp, painful look at the last days of slavery</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Andrea wore her ambition openly and her success lightly. She took her craft seriously, but not herself. She wanted her work to be read widely. For most of her literary career, she felt she had to fight for recognition. But with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/feb/14/featuresreviews.guardianreview10\">publication of Small Island</a> came the broader acclaim she had earned and deserved.</p> <p>She wrote to me describing the excitement of being invited back to Centerprise, a bookshop and community centre in Hackney (now closed down), where she had done readings for her previous books, and her shock at the reception for Small Island: \u201cUsually, I get 10 in the audience ... if I\u2019m lucky. This time the place was filled to capacity (100 ... more) There was almost a sense of ownership coming from them about the book, which was really nice. I felt well loved-up, I can tell you.\u201d</p> <p>With the success of Small Island, she told me, she could retire from striving. \u201cSomething got put to bed. Running to stand still, wanting to be part of that literary thing \u2013 all that has left me. I could quite happily not have anything to do with that world now,\u201d she said.</p> <p>For a few years, there was what seemed like a blissful period when Bill would start each day by throwing a cookbook down on the counter and then cooking the dish from whatever page it landed on. He and Andrea would head to the shops to buy the ingredients and she would write and do household admin while Bill cooked.</p> <p>But she couldn\u2019t withdraw from writing for long. Soon came The Long Song and then her diagnosis; it would make her more engaged and determined.</p> <p>Referring to her own cancer, the late essayist and novelist Susan Sontag said: \u201cThere is something about facing a mortal illness that means you never completely come back. Once you\u2019ve had the death sentence, you have taken on board in a deeper way the knowledge of your own mortality ... there\u2019s something in you that\u2019s permanently strengthened or deepened. It\u2019s called having a life.\u201d</p> <p>It always felt to me as though Andrea became more driven the closer she came to the end. Keen to broaden the British historical gaze beyond its borders, particularly to the Caribbean, she became increasingly frustrated with the limited and limiting imaginations of media gatekeepers when it came to the Caribbean and slavery. Resolving to use the currency she had now gained to expand our historical literacy, she pushed at every meeting and every level for a fuller, more rounded, more inclusive version of our national story.</p> <p>Britain has lost a great author. I have lost a dear friend.</p>",

I first met Andrea at a Guardian summer party in 1999. She was standing on her own when I approached her and told her I was a great admirer of her first two books. She smiled and withdrew slightly, mistaking me for either a stalker or a fantasist. It took all my powers of persuasion to get her to agree to have lunch with me. \u201cI was deeply, deeply suspicious,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI\u2019d never had anybody do that to me before.\u201d Over the years, we became close friends. She was like an older sister to me: protective, encouraging, generous, gently chiding, affectionately mocking, always loving. When I lived in America, I often stayed with her and Bill, who are godparents to my daughter, on my visits to London, and she would make sure the fridge was stocked with all the things I loved \u2013 invariably fattening or alcohol-related \u2013 which she would then tease me about. We shared a sense of humour \u2013 raucous, playful and occasionally bizarre \u2013 and a politics that was rooted in anti-racism, equality and internationalism. After I wrote a column defending the right of black and brown Parisian youth to take to the streets against racist policing, she emailed her support. \u201cI fear that you may need to watch your back more than usual,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou know where I am if you need me.\u201d But our connection was primarily rooted in our experiences as black writers from working-class backgrounds who were ambitious about our work but deeply sceptical about the culture of the professions we had chosen and bloody-minded about our desire to define achievement on our own terms. Andrea wore her ambition openly and her success lightly. She took her craft seriously, but not herself. She wanted her work to be read widely. For most of her literary career, she felt she had to fight for recognition. But with the publication of Small Island came the broader acclaim she had earned and deserved. She wrote to me describing the excitement of being invited back to Centerprise, a bookshop and community centre in Hackney (now closed down), where she had done readings for her previous books, and her shock at the reception for Small Island: \u201cUsually, I get 10 in the audience ... if I\u2019m lucky. This time the place was filled to capacity (100 ... more) There was almost a sense of ownership coming from them about the book, which was really nice. I felt well loved-up, I can tell you.\u201d With the success of Small Island, she told me, she could retire from striving. \u201cSomething got put to bed. Running to stand still, wanting to be part of that literary thing \u2013 all that has left me. I could quite happily not have anything to do with that world now,\u201d she said. For a few years, there was what seemed like a blissful period when Bill would start each day by throwing a cookbook down on the counter and then cooking the dish from whatever page it landed on. He and Andrea would head to the shops to buy the ingredients and she would write and do household admin while Bill cooked. But she couldn\u2019t withdraw from writing for long. Soon came The Long Song and then her diagnosis; it would make her more engaged and determined. Referring to her own cancer, the late essayist and novelist Susan Sontag said: \u201cThere is something about facing a mortal illness that means you never completely come back. Once you\u2019ve had the death sentence, you have taken on board in a deeper way the knowledge of your own mortality ... there\u2019s something in you that\u2019s permanently strengthened or deepened. It\u2019s called having a life.\u201d It always felt to me as though Andrea became more driven the closer she came to the end. Keen to broaden the British historical gaze beyond its borders, particularly to the Caribbean, she became increasingly frustrated with the limited and limiting imaginations of media gatekeepers when it came to the Caribbean and slavery. Resolving to use the currency she had now gained to expand our historical literacy, she pushed at every meeting and every level for a fuller, more rounded, more inclusive version of our national story. Britain has lost a great author. I have lost a dear friend.",

In an interview with the Guardian, Juan Guaid\u00f3 \u2013 now recognised as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate interim president by more than 50 governments \u2013 insisted his country\u2019s march into a new political era was unstoppable and Maduro\u2019s \u201ccruel dictatorship\u201d doomed.

      "body": "<p>The writer Andrea Levy, who explored the experience of Jamaican British people in a series of novels over 20 years has died, aged 62, from cancer.</p> <p>After starting to write as a hobby in her early 30s, Levy published three novels in the 1990s that brought her positive reviews and steady sales. But her fourth novel, Small Island, launched her into the literary big league, winning the 2004 Orange prize, the Whitbread book of the year and the Commonwealth Writers\u2019 prize, selling more than 1m copies around the world and inspiring a 2009 BBC TV adaptation.</p> <p>On Friday, authors including Candice Carty-Williams, Linda Grant and Malorie Blackman paid tribute, with Blackman remembering a \u201cwarm, funny and generous spirit.\u201d </p> <p>On Twitter, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott called Small Island \u201ca groundbreaking, definitive book about the post war Caribbean immigrant experience. Her voice will be greatly missed.\u201d While Sir Lenny Henry, a board member of the National Theatre, which is staging an adaptation of the novel this spring, said she was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/blog/tribute-andrea-levy-sir-lenny-henry\">funny, had attitude and was immensely smart</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Helen Edmundson, who adapted the novel for stage, called working with Levy \u201ca joy and a privilege\u201d. \u201cLike her books, she was uncompromising and funny, wise and honest,\u201d Edmundson told the Guardian. \u201cThere was nothing I couldn\u2019t ask her, and always something we could laugh about. Although we sometimes fantasised about miracles, we knew it was very unlikely that she would ever see the play. Her support for the script I arrived at meant everything. I once told her that adapting Small Island was as complex and important as adapting War and Peace. She loved that. She was, and is, one of the greats.\u201d</p> <p>Her longtime editor Jane Morpeth said she was \u201cincredibly honoured to be Andrea\u2019s publisher and to call her my friend\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI was so proud to watch her win prizes, be read by millions of people and reshape the literary world around her. Her legacy is unique, and her voice will be heard for generations to come. I miss her,\u201d said Morpeth.</p> <p>Levy was born in London in 1956 to parents who were part of the boom in immigration that shaped postwar Britain, her father arriving in the UK on the Empire Windrush in 1948 and her mother following shortly afterwards.

      "bodyText": "The writer Andrea Levy, who explored the experience of Jamaican British people in a series of novels over 20 years has died, aged 62, from cancer. After starting to write as a hobby in her early 30s, Levy published three novels in the 1990s that brought her positive reviews and steady sales. But her fourth novel, Small Island, launched her into the literary big league, winning the 2004 Orange prize, the Whitbread book of the year and the Commonwealth Writers\u2019 prize, selling more than 1m copies around the world and inspiring a 2009 BBC TV adaptation. On Friday, authors including Candice Carty-Williams, Linda Grant and Malorie Blackman paid tribute, with Blackman remembering a \u201cwarm, funny and generous spirit.\u201d On Twitter, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott called Small Island \u201ca groundbreaking, definitive book about the post war Caribbean immigrant experience. Her voice will be greatly missed.\u201d While Sir Lenny Henry, a board member of the National Theatre, which is staging an adaptation of the novel this spring, said she was \u201cfunny, had attitude and was immensely smart\u201d. Helen Edmundson, who adapted the novel for stage, called working with Levy \u201ca joy and a privilege\u201d. \u201cLike her books, she was uncompromising and funny, wise and honest,\u201d Edmundson told the Guardian. \u201cThere was nothing I couldn\u2019t ask her, and always something we could laugh about. Although we sometimes fantasised about miracles, we knew it was very unlikely that she would ever see the play. Her support for the script I arrived at meant everything. I once told her that adapting Small Island was as complex and important as adapting War and Peace. She loved that. She was, and is, one of the greats.\u201d Her longtime editor Jane Morpeth said she was \u201cincredibly honoured to be Andrea\u2019s publisher and to call her my friend\u201d. \u201cI was so proud to watch her win prizes, be read by millions of people and reshape the literary world around her. Her legacy is unique, and her voice will be heard for generations to come. I miss her,\u201d said Morpeth. Levy was born in London in 1956 to parents who were part of the boom in immigration that shaped postwar Britain, her father arriving in the UK on the Empire Windrush in 1948 and her mother following shortly afterwards. She grew up on a council estate in Highbury, north London, explaining to the Guardian in 1999 that she did not read much: \u201cBeing a working-class girl, I watched telly.\u201d The casual racism Levy encountered during her childhood was \u201crarely violent, or extreme\u201d, she wrote in 2014, but it had a profound effect. \u201cI hated myself,\u201d she explained. \u201cI was ashamed of my family, and embarrassed that they came from the Caribbean. In my effort to be as British as I could I was completely indifferent to Jamaica.\u201d After studying textiles at Middlesex Polytechnic, Levy worked briefly as a designer, a dresser and a receptionist. But it was not until she was 26 that a racial awareness session with colleagues at an Islington sex education project gave her a \u201crude awakening\u201d. \u201cWe were asked to split into two groups, black and white.\u201d Levy wrote. \u201cI walked over to the white side of the room. It was, ironically, where I felt most at home \u2013 all my friends, my boyfriend, my flatmates, were white. But my fellow workers had other ideas and I found myself being beckoned over by people on the black side. With some hesitation I crossed the floor.\u201d As someone who was \u201cscared\u201d to call herself a black person, the experience was shocking enough to send her to bed for a week. But the writing course she had begun part-time came to her rescue, sending her back to explore the shame and denial that had marked her childhood and to rediscover her Jamaican roots.

He had already missed a couple of calls from an unknown number. \u201cI don\u2019t usually answer them but something told me to answer it, so I answered it and it was Ian Rush,\u201d Wilson explains, smiling. \u201cHe was like: \u2018Hiya Harry, it\u2019s Ian Rush.\u2019 I was like: \u2018What do I call him?

It was all a bit of a blur at the time and I just wanted to go on, try and get a touch of the ball and work hard for the five minutes that I was on. We drew the game 1-1, so I\u2019ll take a bit of credit for that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Laughter fills the room, and not for the first time, as Wilson goes on to explain how an under-18s game against Blackburn four days after his Wales bow against Kevin De Bruyne and Eden Hazard in front of 45,000 quickly brought him back to reality. But when Wilson mentions that De Bruyne tried and failed to obtain his shirt \u2013 now framed on the wall at his parents\u2019 house in Corwen, near Wrexham \u2013 the interview inevitably sticks for a moment on that memorable night in Brussels.</p> \n<p>\u201cI went over to Hazard first and he had already swapped but I thought: \u2018He\u2019s going to have a spare,\u2019 so I was like: \u2018Can I get it?\u2019 He said: \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ll pass it to you inside,\u2019 but because they had qualified, they went straight back out and they were doing a lap of the pitch and we were like: \u2018Let\u2019s just get out of here,\u2019 really. I went over to De Bruyne, and he wanted mine, but I thought: \u2018It\u2019s my debut shirt, I can\u2019t give you this.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Wilson\u2019s journey with Wales helps punctuate his early career, from the shock of that debut to waiting 1,619 days to win his next cap. At Euro 2016 Wilson was among the 10,000-plus Wales fans in Bordeaux watching the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/11/wales-slovakia-euro-2016-match-report\" title=\"\">Group A opener against Slovakia</a>. These days he is 21 years old, a staple of Ryan Giggs\u2019s squad and lighting up the Championship on loan at Derby County, who take on Brighton in the FA Cup fifth round on Saturday.</p> \n<p>He makes smashing company at the club\u2019s Moor Farm training base. Wilson is refreshingly humble and politely knocks at the door before beginning a candid conversation that takes in how he has developed under Frank Lampard, a text from J\u00fcrgen Klopp after his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/sep/25/manchester-united-derby-county-carabao-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">exquisite free-kick</a> at Manchester United in the Carabao Cup, the subsequent five-fingered salute and how, with the help of the club nutritionist Andreas Kasper, a fortnightly Masterchef challenge at the house in which Wilson lives with Mason Mount keeps any competition healthy. The housemates take it in turns to do the weekly shop at Tesco, play Fortnite and make use of the gym in a property that the former Derby goalkeeper Lee Grant used to call home.</p> \n<p>There has been plenty of noise around Wilson more or less ever since he signed for Liverpool\u2019s under-nines. Others spotted his talent earlier, his grandad <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/16/harry-wilson-grandfather-makes-125k-on-bet\" title=\"\">netting \u00a3125,000</a> after placing a \u00a350 bet on Wilson playing for his country while he was a toddler. Up until the age of 16, when Wilson moved into digs with Ryan Kent, he was ferried to and from training from north Wales by his mother, Nicola, and father, Mark, as well as by both sets of grandparents. \u201cI think it was 63 miles door to door,\u201d he says. \u201cMonday, Wednesday and Friday until I was 12, then four times a week and then five times a week. It was a massive commitment. Without my mum, dad and my grandparents it wouldn\u2019t have been possible to get where I am now.\u201d He has been associated with Liverpool since the age of eight and Wilson says the city feels like his \u201csecond home\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n  <br>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As the club\u2019s academy director, Alex Inglethorpe, recently said, some players take the elevator, others the stairs, referencing Trent Alexander-Arnold and the winger. Wilson, free-scoring for the under-23s after being named captain in 2016, made his only first-team appearance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/18/plymouth-argyle-liverpool-fa-cup-third-round-replay-match-report\" title=\"\">against Plymouth</a> the following year, replacing Philippe Coutinho. His next is surely only a matter of time.

      "bodyText": "In October 2013, Harry Wilson was having a lie-in, watching television in bed in academy digs in Eccleston, round the corner from Liverpool\u2019s academy in Kirkby, when his phone rang again. He had already missed a couple of calls from an unknown number. \u201cI don\u2019t usually answer them but something told me to answer it, so I answered it and it was Ian Rush,\u201d Wilson explains, smiling. \u201cHe was like: \u2018Hiya Harry, it\u2019s Ian Rush.\u2019 I was like: \u2018What do I call him? Do I call him Ian? Do I call him Rushy?\u2019 I didn\u2019t really know what to call him.\u201d It was a conversation that culminated in Wilson being whisked to Cardiff the next morning after being called up to the Wales squad, before making his international debut against Belgium aged 16 years and 207 days in a World Cup qualifier almost a week later, breaking Gareth Bale\u2019s record as the country\u2019s youngest player. \u201cWe were 1-0 down with five or 10 minutes to go, Chris Coleman said: \u2018You\u2019re going on,\u2019 and then it was a mixture of nerves and excitement really. It was all a bit of a blur at the time and I just wanted to go on, try and get a touch of the ball and work hard for the five minutes that I was on. We drew the game 1-1, so I\u2019ll take a bit of credit for that.\u201d Laughter fills the room, and not for the first time, as Wilson goes on to explain how an under-18s game against Blackburn four days after his Wales bow against Kevin De Bruyne and Eden Hazard in front of 45,000 quickly brought him back to reality. But when Wilson mentions that De Bruyne tried and failed to obtain his shirt \u2013 now framed on the wall at his parents\u2019 house in Corwen, near Wrexham \u2013 the interview inevitably sticks for a moment on that memorable night in Brussels. \u201cI went over to Hazard first and he had already swapped but I thought: \u2018He\u2019s going to have a spare,\u2019 so I was like: \u2018Can I get it?\u2019 He said: \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ll pass it to you inside,\u2019 but because they had qualified, they went straight back out and they were doing a lap of the pitch and we were like: \u2018Let\u2019s just get out of here,\u2019 really. I went over to De Bruyne, and he wanted mine, but I thought: \u2018It\u2019s my debut shirt, I can\u2019t give you this.\u2019\u201d Wilson\u2019s journey with Wales helps punctuate his early career, from the shock of that debut to waiting 1,619 days to win his next cap. At Euro 2016 Wilson was among the 10,000-plus Wales fans in Bordeaux watching the Group A opener against Slovakia. These days he is 21 years old, a staple of Ryan Giggs\u2019s squad and lighting up the Championship on loan at Derby County, who take on Brighton in the FA Cup fifth round on Saturday. He makes smashing company at the club\u2019s Moor Farm training base. Wilson is refreshingly humble and politely knocks at the door before beginning a candid conversation that takes in how he has developed under Frank Lampard, a text from J\u00fcrgen Klopp after his exquisite free-kick at Manchester United in the Carabao Cup, the subsequent five-fingered salute and how, with the help of the club nutritionist Andreas Kasper, a fortnightly Masterchef challenge at the house in which Wilson lives with Mason Mount keeps any competition healthy. The housemates take it in turns to do the weekly shop at Tesco, play Fortnite and make use of the gym in a property that the former Derby goalkeeper Lee Grant used to call home. There has been plenty of noise around Wilson more or less ever since he signed for Liverpool\u2019s under-nines. Others spotted his talent earlier, his grandad netting \u00a3125,000 after placing a \u00a350 bet on Wilson playing for his country while he was a toddler. Up until the age of 16, when Wilson moved into digs with Ryan Kent, he was ferried to and from training from north Wales by his mother, Nicola, and father, Mark, as well as by both sets of grandparents. \u201cI think it was 63 miles door to door,\u201d he says. \u201cMonday, Wednesday and Friday until I was 12, then four times a week and then five times a week. It was a massive commitment. Without my mum, dad and my grandparents it wouldn\u2019t have been possible to get where I am now.\u201d He has been associated with Liverpool since the age of eight and Wilson says the city feels like his \u201csecond home\u201d. As the club\u2019s academy director, Alex Inglethorpe, recently said, some players take the elevator, others the stairs, referencing Trent Alexander-Arnold and the winger. Wilson, free-scoring for the under-23s after being named captain in 2016, made his only first-team appearance against Plymouth the following year, replacing Philippe Coutinho. His next is surely only a matter of time. For Derby, Wilson has impressed centrally as well as on the right flank but, despite making a splash in four months at Hull last year (seven goals in 14 games), he acknowledges his first loan, at Crewe in 2015, was not quite so successful. \u201cIt taught me a lot and made me grow up fast. I\u2019m a lot more confident now; I think I\u2019m a lot wiser as well. I was in a struggling team in League One and I\u2019ve seen how tough it is when you are trying to scrape out points at the bottom of the league. Now I\u2019m at a team here where I feel we play really good football, at the top end of the table and you feel you can express yourself that little bit more.\u201d Wilson has certainly done that. Lampard has emphasised how the youngster has improved his all-round play \u2013 that he has more than wonder goals to his game \u2013 but there is no getting away from the fact that Wilson is a specialist in the spectacular. His biggest weapon is those now commonplace piercing strikes from distance, having built a growing portfolio of bewitching free-kicks, none more so than his preposterous left-footed effort against United. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise it was as good as it was because it just happened and I was off celebrating.

      "body": "<h2>Heavy metal: more is more in metallic makeup</h2> <p>Metallics routinely make their way into makeup, but this season\u2019s approach was definitely more is more. Foil, gold and metallic shades were so heavily layered at Halpern that the eyes \u201cbecame an accessory\u201d themselves, according to makeup artist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/isamayaffrench/?hl=en\">Isamaya Ffrench</a>, who added so much gold that the models\u2019 eyelids looked like foil. Her inspiration was focused \u2013 \u201ca bit Twiggy, a bit 60s\u201d \u2013 and the look was super-glam. At Jeremy Scott, makeup artist Kabuki turned lips rose gold, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/aug/06/beauty-queen-how-pat-mcgrath-revolutionised-makeup\">Pat McGrath</a> added striking metallic green cat eyes to her Versace girls. For Simone Rocha, mega hair stylist Sam Bryant pressed pink and silver glitter into models\u2019 hair and \u201csmooshed\u201d it on to eyelids. This is not a subtle look. Instead, it\u2019s the kind of approach that will gain a lot of love online, where fans live for out-of-this-world looks on cult beauty accounts such as those of McGrath, Kabuki and Jeffree Star. Our advice? Think fingerpainting for inspiration and bring some sparkle to spring. MF</p> <h2>Run-for-the-bus sensible footwear: not just for school</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9a42cfa0ed7617f65f0b3c3c55a33fb2b493d8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9a42cfa0ed7617f65f0b3c3c55a33fb2b493d8d/0_0_5056_3033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Buckle up: leather sandals, \u00a3740, Preen.

As in school-appropriate, run-for-the-bus sensible. This season, leather sandals come as if from Start-Rite, with practical details such as buckles and proper soles. Preen\u2019s were straight from the 20s and Just William, paired with lace-topped school socks instead of muddy knees. Ports 1961\u2019s were espadrille-like but in proper leather, while Giambattista Valli and Sacai took a leaf out of Birkenstock\u2019s book, zhooshing up sandals with jewels. Even Chanel\u2019s were beach appropriate, coming with a barely-there or sturdy \u201cvamp\u201d heel, so your feet don\u2019t fall out. Models might have carried theirs on the sand-covered catwalk but, still, sensible shoes are Lagerfeld-approved this season. MF</p> <h2>How high can you go? The trend for micro shorts</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1e09967c9510aea72e2e4676a1960d976d7636e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e09967c9510aea72e2e4676a1960d976d7636e2/129_120_2613_4024/649.jpg\" alt=\"Prada\u2019s micro shorts for men.\" width=\"649\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prada\u2019s micro shorts for men.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pixelformula/Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For men, it\u2019s a case of the shorter the short, the better. Prada had micro ones, Cottweiler\u2019s were longer, in leather, Fendi\u2019s bore a double F monogram and Herm\u00e8s\u2019 were crisp and white and even.</p> <p>What\u2019s behind it? Blame our ongoing preference for sportswear, climate change or Miuccia Prada, who defied gender norms to put men in what she called \u201cthe equivalent of a miniskirt\u201d. MF</p> <h2>When two become one: how twinsets took over the catwalk</h2> <p>Twinsets have shrugged off their Sloane Ranger reputation and returned for SS19 \u2013 without the pearls, proving their appeal lies not in twee costume party nostalgia or a desire to look like Mad Men\u2019s Betty Draper. Instead, Marc Jacobs tapped into the look\u2019s 40s origins by styling his mint green twinset with lattice gloves and a choker corsage. APC went hands-free with a sugar-pink set buttoned at the neck, then draped. Tory Burch gave it a weekend-retreat update with a slouchy orange ensemble, while Miu Miu mismatched a cropped striped sweater with teeny grey cardigan, channelling shrunk-in-the-wash chic. This season, with knitwear, twinning is winning.

It came suitably wholesome at Ralph Lauren\u2019s 50th anniversary show, while Stuart Vevers at Coach gave it a grungy twist and the Vaquera collective reimagined it in rebel style. At Calvin Klein, Raf Simons\u2019 mortarboards may be a step too far for most, but pleated skirts and patchwork blazers are an easy way to access the Ivy League aesthetic, even if you are far from Yale\u2019s hallowed halls.

When Balenciaga put unreconstructed officewear (think boxy suiting and oversized jackets) on its SS19 catwalk, Demna Gvasalia added the logo recast in different Microsoft Word fonts, including the much derided Comic Sans. Given the brand\u2019s modus operandi is finding beauty in what is deemed ugly, it\u2019s not an outlandish pairing. Feel free to adjust your email font accordingly. MF</p> <h2>Beige: the shade of SS19</h2> <p>If you\u2019re still \u2013 rather uncharitably, perhaps \u2013 describing boring things as beige, it\u2019s time to update your vocab. Fashion has stepped in to magic the much-derided colour of drab into the shade of now. Move over, Millennial Pink and Living Coral; beige is set to saturate the last year of our decade. Riccardo Tisci, JW Anderson, Clare Waight Keller and the Olsens are among the designers making the shade happen. At Burberry, Tisci \u2013 in his first collection \u2013 took his cue from the brand\u2019s signature trenchcoat and sent out beige galore. (The takeaway? It looks great with red.) Elsewhere, it was draped, ruched and layered in everything from silk to tweed to leather (at Miu Miu, it came in head-to-toe super--smooth cowhide). So what is to be read into the collective gravitation towards the hue more often associated with home furnishings? Is it a neutral colour for our troubled times? Or a palette cleanser for change to come? Either way, adjust your thinking now.

Monse used a print of rope knots while The Row and Courr\u00e8ges had it tying up dresses and tops. Nautical cord was even wrapped round waists in Victoria Beckham\u2019s 10th anniversary collection. This is an effective styling trick that will be easy to take DIY \u2013 start with a bowline and go from there. Sailing skills are stylish this season. SC</p> <h2>Take a bow: the most prettifying of accessories</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1a299c05f67f6f561e5954e5dd35d54ad2e33bc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a299c05f67f6f561e5954e5dd35d54ad2e33bc2/0_0_920_1380/667.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Behr Velvet bow hairclip \u00a395\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Velvet bow hairclip, \u00a395, Jennifer Behr from <a href=\"https://www.net-a-porter.com/gb/en/product/1123735?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;cm_mmc=Google-ProductSearch-UK--c-_-NAP_EN_UK_PLA-_-NAP+-+UK%C2%A0-%C2%A0GS%C2%A0-+Designer+-+Class_Accessories+-%C2%A0High%C2%A0-%C2%A0BT--Accessories+-+Hair+Accessories_INTL&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIh-TJuYus4AIVzJPtCh2klwYDEAQYASABEgJOgfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Net-a-Porter</a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From a hair-tie to the middle of your bra, bows are the ultimate in everyday prettifying. They are also huge \u2013 often literally \u2013 this season. At Erdem, they were bountiful round waists, tapping into the bow\u2019s association with femininity dating back to the Victorian era. Meanwhile, the pussy bow, favoured by Joan Crawford, Margaret Thatcher and Melania Trump, proved catnip for Riccardo Tisci at Burberry. Giant back-bows \u2013 the ultimate in gift-dressing? \u2013 were at Moschino and Emilia Wickstead. The latter incorporated bows as hairpieces, a trend that dates back to the 40s, when they indicated the status of a girl\u2019s love life.

      "bodyText": "Heavy metal: more is more in metallic makeup Metallics routinely make their way into makeup, but this season\u2019s approach was definitely more is more. Foil, gold and metallic shades were so heavily layered at Halpern that the eyes \u201cbecame an accessory\u201d themselves, according to makeup artist Isamaya Ffrench, who added so much gold that the models\u2019 eyelids looked like foil. Her inspiration was focused \u2013 \u201ca bit Twiggy, a bit 60s\u201d \u2013 and the look was super-glam. At Jeremy Scott, makeup artist Kabuki turned lips rose gold, while Pat McGrath added striking metallic green cat eyes to her Versace girls. For Simone Rocha, mega hair stylist Sam Bryant pressed pink and silver glitter into models\u2019 hair and \u201csmooshed\u201d it on to eyelids. This is not a subtle look. Instead, it\u2019s the kind of approach that will gain a lot of love online, where fans live for out-of-this-world looks on cult beauty accounts such as those of McGrath, Kabuki and Jeffree Star. Our advice? Think fingerpainting for inspiration and bring some sparkle to spring. MF Run-for-the-bus sensible footwear: not just for school In footwear, sensible can mean anything \u2013 a flat, a boot, something affordable, something demure \u2013 but sometimes it means just that: sensible. As in school-appropriate, run-for-the-bus sensible. This season, leather sandals come as if from Start-Rite, with practical details such as buckles and proper soles. Preen\u2019s were straight from the 20s and Just William, paired with lace-topped school socks instead of muddy knees. Ports 1961\u2019s were espadrille-like but in proper leather, while Giambattista Valli and Sacai took a leaf out of Birkenstock\u2019s book, zhooshing up sandals with jewels. Even Chanel\u2019s were beach appropriate, coming with a barely-there or sturdy \u201cvamp\u201d heel, so your feet don\u2019t fall out. Models might have carried theirs on the sand-covered catwalk but, still, sensible shoes are Lagerfeld-approved this season. MF How high can you go? The trend for micro shorts For men, it\u2019s a case of the shorter the short, the better. Prada had micro ones, Cottweiler\u2019s were longer, in leather, Fendi\u2019s bore a double F monogram and Herm\u00e8s\u2019 were crisp and white and even. What\u2019s behind it? Blame our ongoing preference for sportswear, climate change or Miuccia Prada, who defied gender norms to put men in what she called \u201cthe equivalent of a miniskirt\u201d. MF When two become one: how twinsets took over the catwalk Twinsets have shrugged off their Sloane Ranger reputation and returned for SS19 \u2013 without the pearls, proving their appeal lies not in twee costume party nostalgia or a desire to look like Mad Men\u2019s Betty Draper. Instead, Marc Jacobs tapped into the look\u2019s 40s origins by styling his mint green twinset with lattice gloves and a choker corsage. APC went hands-free with a sugar-pink set buttoned at the neck, then draped. Tory Burch gave it a weekend-retreat update with a slouchy orange ensemble, while Miu Miu mismatched a cropped striped sweater with teeny grey cardigan, channelling shrunk-in-the-wash chic. This season, with knitwear, twinning is winning. LH Preppy chic: from high school to high style There\u2019s comfort to be found in the familiar letterman jackets and preppy details of the varsity trend. It came suitably wholesome at Ralph Lauren\u2019s 50th anniversary show, while Stuart Vevers at Coach gave it a grungy twist and the Vaquera collective reimagined it in rebel style. At Calvin Klein, Raf Simons\u2019 mortarboards may be a step too far for most, but pleated skirts and patchwork blazers are an easy way to access the Ivy League aesthetic, even if you are far from Yale\u2019s hallowed halls. SC Comic Sans: how fashion fell for fonts How did the world\u2019s most hated font end up on a beloved brand? When Balenciaga put unreconstructed officewear (think boxy suiting and oversized jackets) on its SS19 catwalk, Demna Gvasalia added the logo recast in different Microsoft Word fonts, including the much derided Comic Sans. Given the brand\u2019s modus operandi is finding beauty in what is deemed ugly, it\u2019s not an outlandish pairing. Feel free to adjust your email font accordingly. MF Beige: the shade of SS19 If you\u2019re still \u2013 rather uncharitably, perhaps \u2013 describing boring things as beige, it\u2019s time to update your vocab. Fashion has stepped in to magic the much-derided colour of drab into the shade of now. Move over, Millennial Pink and Living Coral; beige is set to saturate the last year of our decade. Riccardo Tisci, JW Anderson, Clare Waight Keller and the Olsens are among the designers making the shade happen. At Burberry, Tisci \u2013 in his first collection \u2013 took his cue from the brand\u2019s signature trenchcoat and sent out beige galore. (The takeaway? It looks great with red.) Elsewhere, it was draped, ruched and layered in everything from silk to tweed to leather (at Miu Miu, it came in head-to-toe super--smooth cowhide). So what is to be read into the collective gravitation towards the hue more often associated with home furnishings? Is it a neutral colour for our troubled times? Or a palette cleanser for change to come? Either way, adjust your thinking now. SC Do the twist: wear rope to tie up your look You may be used to tying it or skipping with it, but this season, try wearing rope \u2013 it coiled its way into multiple collections. Monse used a print of rope knots while The Row and Courr\u00e8ges had it tying up dresses and tops. Nautical cord was even wrapped round waists in Victoria Beckham\u2019s 10th anniversary collection. This is an effective styling trick that will be easy to take DIY \u2013 start with a bowline and go from there. Sailing skills are stylish this season. SC Take a bow: the most prettifying of accessories From a hair-tie to the middle of your bra, bows are the ultimate in everyday prettifying. They are also huge \u2013 often literally \u2013 this season. At Erdem, they were bountiful round waists, tapping into the bow\u2019s association with femininity dating back to the Victorian era. Meanwhile, the pussy bow, favoured by Joan Crawford, Margaret Thatcher and Melania Trump, proved catnip for Riccardo Tisci at Burberry. Giant back-bows \u2013 the ultimate in gift-dressing? \u2013 were at Moschino and Emilia Wickstead. The latter incorporated bows as hairpieces, a trend that dates back to the 40s, when they indicated the status of a girl\u2019s love life. Bows as belts, seen in velvet at Marc Jacobs and satin at Rodarte, are the kind of trimming that works for right now, thanks to the minimum effort, maximum impact ratio any time-poor person can appreciate. LH Everyday\u2019s a catwalk: cataloguing fashion, minus the gloss What comes after the glam, the glitter and the gloss? How are photographers adapting to the digital age? Patrick Remy seeks the answers in AntiGlossy (Rizzoli, \u00a335).

      "body": "<p>As a 17-year-old London schoolboy, Eric Hobsbawm solemnly confided to his diary in 1934: \u201cI am an intellectual through and through \u2013 with all the weakness of an intellectual \u2013 inhibitions, complexes etc.\u201d It\u2019s an endearing glimpse \u2013 part self-criticism, part self-importance, part the recognisable tendency of the bookish teenage boy to rationalise Trouble With Girls. Hobsbawm went on to become a professor, a political guru and eventually something of a national treasure. But for the rest of his long life (he died in 2012), he remained above all an intellectual, in several of the senses of that protean term.</p> <p>As a youth, he was something of a prodigy. Growing up in an Anglo-Austrian Jewish family in Vienna, Berlin and London, he was bilingual in English and German, later acquiring faultless French and eventually good Italian, more than passable Spanish and Portuguese, and a smattering of other languages. He read everything he could get his hands on (as so often, public libraries play an unsung role), so that when he went up to Cambridge in 1936 the word was that \u201cthere\u2019s a freshman in King\u2019s who knows about everything\u201d. He duly carried off all the prizes: starred firsts, editor of Granta, a member of the select intellectual society the Apostles. When he graduated in the summer of 1939, it seemed he had the world at his feet.</p> <p>The world, however, had other things on its mind. Hobsbawm did not have a good war. He never saw action; he never achieved a commission; he never even got a foreign posting. His military career stalled at the undizzy peak of being an NCO in the Education Corps at camps in rural England, and even then he seemed to be constantly falling foul of the authorities. Why this waste of such striking talents?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>When he went up to Cambridge in 1936 the word was that 'there\u2019s a freshman in King\u2019s who knows about everything'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Richard Evans\u2019s exceptionally well-researched biography is able to document the obvious answer. As a member of the Communist party of Great Britain, Hobsbawm came under surveillance by MI5, who blocked his advancement. (Biographers of other individuals may come to wish their subjects had been similarly suspect: in this case the British state has provided the biographer with a cornucopia of evidence, including meticulously logged accounts of Hobsbawm\u2019s movements and transcripts of conversations at the bugged headquarters of the CPGB.)</p> <p>Even after the outbreak of peace, Hobsbawm\u2019s career did not prosper as one might have expected. He didn\u2019t get the academic jobs he most wanted; he twice had books turned down by publishers. He also had a long period of thrashing about emotionally after a brief, unhappy first marriage. In the late 1950s he was more often to be found in the bars and jazz clubs of Soho than the usual haunts of established academics. It is always important to remember (and perhaps take cheer from) the fact that the immensely prolific Hobsbawm did not publish his first book until he was 42. But, characteristically, he had already sparked two fruitful long-running historiographical debates with original articles on the \u201cgeneral crisis\u201d of 17th-century Europe and on the standard of living of the British working class during the industrial revolution.</p> <p>In political terms, what most mattered to the young Hobsbawm, and continued to matter, was the spirit of the Popular Front as a form of resistance to fascism in the 1930s. At the time, the Communist party seemed the most robust and clear-headed element in this coalition, certainly as viewed from early 1930s Berlin (where Hobsbawm lived for two years in his mid-teens). But it was the sense of being mobilised, being part of a movement, that had stirred and permanently marked him. As he confided to his diary in 1950: \u201cFor us there is no life fit for a human being without taking part in a movement like ours,\u201d though we do occasionally get glimpses of him in more sardonic mode, as in his later observation about the motives of one comrade for joining a delegation to visit Cuba that he was \u201cnot without an interest in foreign nooky\u201d.</p> <p>Thereafter, Hobsbawm was frequently at odds with the orthodoxies of the Moscow-subservient leadership of the Communist party of Great Britain, and a distinctly semi-detached member after 1956. As Evans rightly observes: \u201cEric wanted to have his cake and eat it. On the one hand he was wedded at a very deep emotional level to the idea of belonging to the communist movement, but on the other hand he was absolutely not willing to submit to the discipline the party demanded.\u201d Judgments of Hobsbawm\u2019s consistency and even probity on this matter have varied \u2013 he was subject to fierce criticism for never formally resigning from the party \u2013 but loyalty to anti-fascist commitments formed in the 1930s and fidelity to his vocation as an independent-minded intellectual seem to me intelligible, even admirable, in themselves. Sometimes the logical stringency of the all cake/no cake purists doesn\u2019t sufficiently take into account the human need for crumbs of comfort.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>He was never an archive-hound, preferring to read an astonishing range of sources and produce an original interpretation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He had not set out to become a professional historian; indeed, at one point he considered becoming a full-time organiser for the party. And although his early work fell in the academic sub-field of economic history, its inspiration was primarily political. For Hobsbawm, as for so many on the left in his generation, the question that needed addressing was the rise and dominance of capitalism: he later reflected that he chose economic history as his field largely because it was the only intellectual space in the academic world at the time where he could pursue his real interests in relations between \u201cbase\u201d and \u201csuperstructure\u201d in explaining social change. Emotionally, his sympathies were with capitalism\u2019s victims and opponents. One of his early rejected books described industrialism as \u201calmost certainly the most catastrophic historical change which has overwhelmed the common people of the world\u201d, and he began to cultivate his interest in the forms of often unorganised or disguised resistance to it, especially forms of \u201csocial banditry\u201d in the countryside. This led to the publication of his influential book<em> Primitive Rebels </em>in 1959, which he followed up with his extremely popular <em>The Age of Revolutions</em> in 1962. After that, the rest is, in every sense, history.</p> <p>One of the most familiar activities of a historian is extracting precious metal from the deep mines of unpublished materials held in archives. But Hobsbawm himself was never an archive hound: his preferred strategy was to read an astonishing range of printed sources in several languages and then produce an original and challenging interpretation out of them. Reflecting in old age on his own practice, he declared: \u201cI would most like to describe myself as a kind of guerilla historian, who doesn\u2019t so much march directly towards his goal behind the artillery fire of the archives, as attack it from the flanking bushes with the Kalashnikov of ideas.\u201d Perhaps a scholar who was always trying to fend off charges of being too soft on the Soviet Union might have done well to choose another metaphor, but this self-description does capture something essential about Hobsbawm\u2019s work, something that accounts for its ability to generate fruitful controversy. It also suggests to me that, for all the grandeur of his four survey volumes on history from 1789 to 1991, he was often at his best in essays and articles, carrying out one of his guerilla raids on accepted interpretations, in the process inflicting no little collateral damage on a number of sacred cows. Evans observes that \u201cessay collections are seldom bestsellers\u201d, but while large-scale narratives may carry off the literary prizes, there\u2019s usually more hard thinking per square inch in essays, and some of Hobsbawm\u2019s best and most influential work is in these shorter forms.</p> <p>This is an immensely impressive biography, quarried from extensive original research in archive collections in (appropriately) several countries. Evans, a distinguished historian of modern Germany, provides clear and well-informed accounts of the various historiographical and other controversies that Hobsbawm was involved in, from time to time gently correcting the old master\u2019s memory in the light of the documentary record. Drawing on Hobsbawm\u2019s vast collection of personal papers, diaries and unpublished writings, he gives a richly detailed picture of his subject\u2019s first four decades (if you want to know the names of the small towns between which the young Hobsbawm hitchhiked in France in the 1930s, Evans is your man), as well as a sympathetic, if inevitably more selective, narrative of his later career.</p> <p>While giving due recognition to the various aspects of his subject\u2019s life, it is clear that Evans is most powerfully drawn by the fact that Hobsbawm became Top Historian, the figure who at the time of his death \u201chad for some years been the best-known and most widely read historian in the world\u201d. This biography puts considerable emphasis on big advances and virile sales figures: a place in the bestseller charts figures as the final consecration. Hobsbawm\u2019s success in these terms was genuinely extraordinary. Brazil was, for complex reasons, the country where he enjoyed the most marked star status, and the translation of his history of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/dec/12/theobserver4\" title=\"\">\u201cshort\u201d</a> 20th century, <em>Age of Extremes</em>, \u201ctopped the bestseller lists in Brazil in 1995, not just the non-fiction but the general lists, including all books of every kind\u201d. Elsewhere, his success was not quite on this scale, but his books were translated into 30 languages and sold hundreds of thousands of copies.</p> <p>It is certainly true that Hobsbawm was possessed of no little literary vanity, and he greatly enjoyed his international celebrity in his later years. It is also true that he relentlessly chivvied agents and publishers about the terms of his contracts and the marketing of his books. So in celebrating him as, above all, an academic historian who became a worldwide literary star, Evans is not being untrue to the character of his subject\u2019s later career. But sales figures are, of course, not necessarily an indication of intellectual quality in themselves, and there are other ways to be a good and important historian (two propositions with which, in their general form, I\u2019m sure Evans would agree). There are certainly other ways in which to be a significant intellectual and political figure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/01/eric-hobsbawm-quotes\">Eric Hobsbawm: a life in quotes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Hobsbawm\u2019s case, some of those ways involved a degree of prominence in the mainstream media \u2013 the place of his \u201cthe long march of Labour halted\u201d thesis in the formation of New Labour is an obvious case in point. But some did not. For example, Evans has very little to say about Hobsbawm\u2019s long analytical introduction to the translation of sections of Karl Marx\u2019s <em>Grundrisse</em>, published in 1964 as <em>Pre-Capitalist Economic Formations</em>, remarking somewhat dismissively that \u201cthe book was of interest mainly to Marxists\u201d. This may risk understating the centrality of Hobsbawm\u2019s dense, sinewy introduction to so much of the radical theorising that flourished in the later 1960s and 70s \u2013 and anyway, might not an important piece of theorising that is read largely by those who share its concerns be at least as valuable an intellectual contribution as a more popular historical survey read by many thousands?

For example, in a talk on Radio 3 in 1972, well before the end of the Vietnam war, Hobsbawm was magnificently unsparing: \u201cHistory will not forgive those who laid waste the countries of Indo-China for a generation, who expelled, mangled, corrupted and massacred peoples for the sake of the calculations of poker-players.

      "bodyText": "As a 17-year-old London schoolboy, Eric Hobsbawm solemnly confided to his diary in 1934: \u201cI am an intellectual through and through \u2013 with all the weakness of an intellectual \u2013 inhibitions, complexes etc.\u201d It\u2019s an endearing glimpse \u2013 part self-criticism, part self-importance, part the recognisable tendency of the bookish teenage boy to rationalise Trouble With Girls. Hobsbawm went on to become a professor, a political guru and eventually something of a national treasure. But for the rest of his long life (he died in 2012), he remained above all an intellectual, in several of the senses of that protean term. As a youth, he was something of a prodigy. Growing up in an Anglo-Austrian Jewish family in Vienna, Berlin and London, he was bilingual in English and German, later acquiring faultless French and eventually good Italian, more than passable Spanish and Portuguese, and a smattering of other languages. He read everything he could get his hands on (as so often, public libraries play an unsung role), so that when he went up to Cambridge in 1936 the word was that \u201cthere\u2019s a freshman in King\u2019s who knows about everything\u201d. He duly carried off all the prizes: starred firsts, editor of Granta, a member of the select intellectual society the Apostles. When he graduated in the summer of 1939, it seemed he had the world at his feet. The world, however, had other things on its mind. Hobsbawm did not have a good war. He never saw action; he never achieved a commission; he never even got a foreign posting. His military career stalled at the undizzy peak of being an NCO in the Education Corps at camps in rural England, and even then he seemed to be constantly falling foul of the authorities. Why this waste of such striking talents? Richard Evans\u2019s exceptionally well-researched biography is able to document the obvious answer. As a member of the Communist party of Great Britain, Hobsbawm came under surveillance by MI5, who blocked his advancement. (Biographers of other individuals may come to wish their subjects had been similarly suspect: in this case the British state has provided the biographer with a cornucopia of evidence, including meticulously logged accounts of Hobsbawm\u2019s movements and transcripts of conversations at the bugged headquarters of the CPGB.) Even after the outbreak of peace, Hobsbawm\u2019s career did not prosper as one might have expected. He didn\u2019t get the academic jobs he most wanted; he twice had books turned down by publishers. He also had a long period of thrashing about emotionally after a brief, unhappy first marriage. In the late 1950s he was more often to be found in the bars and jazz clubs of Soho than the usual haunts of established academics. It is always important to remember (and perhaps take cheer from) the fact that the immensely prolific Hobsbawm did not publish his first book until he was 42. But, characteristically, he had already sparked two fruitful long-running historiographical debates with original articles on the \u201cgeneral crisis\u201d of 17th-century Europe and on the standard of living of the British working class during the industrial revolution. In political terms, what most mattered to the young Hobsbawm, and continued to matter, was the spirit of the Popular Front as a form of resistance to fascism in the 1930s. At the time, the Communist party seemed the most robust and clear-headed element in this coalition, certainly as viewed from early 1930s Berlin (where Hobsbawm lived for two years in his mid-teens). But it was the sense of being mobilised, being part of a movement, that had stirred and permanently marked him. As he confided to his diary in 1950: \u201cFor us there is no life fit for a human being without taking part in a movement like ours,\u201d though we do occasionally get glimpses of him in more sardonic mode, as in his later observation about the motives of one comrade for joining a delegation to visit Cuba that he was \u201cnot without an interest in foreign nooky\u201d. Thereafter, Hobsbawm was frequently at odds with the orthodoxies of the Moscow-subservient leadership of the Communist party of Great Britain, and a distinctly semi-detached member after 1956. As Evans rightly observes: \u201cEric wanted to have his cake and eat it. On the one hand he was wedded at a very deep emotional level to the idea of belonging to the communist movement, but on the other hand he was absolutely not willing to submit to the discipline the party demanded.\u201d Judgments of Hobsbawm\u2019s consistency and even probity on this matter have varied \u2013 he was subject to fierce criticism for never formally resigning from the party \u2013 but loyalty to anti-fascist commitments formed in the 1930s and fidelity to his vocation as an independent-minded intellectual seem to me intelligible, even admirable, in themselves. Sometimes the logical stringency of the all cake/no cake purists doesn\u2019t sufficiently take into account the human need for crumbs of comfort. He had not set out to become a professional historian; indeed, at one point he considered becoming a full-time organiser for the party.

His One Minute sculptures issue instructions to make a sculpture in 60 seconds. Other works make monuments out of sausages or turn the human body into a surreal set of appendages.

Meanwhile, you can see up to series seven. Like the Bayeux Tapestry on which it is based, it is bloody stuff. In fact, it is 18-rated. The TV series\u2019 vision of medieval history features realistic details, from sieges to pies, in among the dragonfire.

Tate Modern, SE1, Wednesday 20 February to 2 June Erwin Wurm An aesthetic somewhere between Duchamp and Tintin makes Wurm\u2019s art instantly appealing. His One Minute sculptures issue instructions to make a sculpture in 60 seconds. Other works make monuments out of sausages or turn the human body into a surreal set of appendages. This Vienna-based conceptualist has a lot in common with Tate Modern\u2019s subversive of the week Franz West. Guaranteed to raise a smile. Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, W1, Tuesday 19 February to 23 March Game of Thrones Tapestry Northern Ireland\u2019s most ingenious take on traditional craft will be completed this summer when events in the final series of Game of Thrones are added. Meanwhile, you can see up to series seven. Like the Bayeux Tapestry on which it is based, it is bloody stuff. In fact, it is 18-rated. The TV series\u2019 vision of medieval history features realistic details, from sieges to pies, in among the dragonfire. What better celebration than a Romanesque artwork? Ulster Museum, Belfast, to 28 July Don McCullin In his 1964 photograph Cyprus, this great photojournalist captures a moment that seems preternaturally composed. The woman\u2019s anguished face as she is being comforted captures suffering like a painting by Caravaggio. Yet you can see it\u2019s absolutely spontaneous. McCullin has achieved such magic many times, documenting tragedies from Biafra to Syria. A British artist of whom we can be proud. Tate Britain, SW1, to 6 May JJ Five of the best ... theatre shows Come from Away Sound the klaxon: it\u2019s a contemporary, Tony award-winning feelgood musical! Come from Away is set in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks (no, really). With US airspace closed, 38 planes were diverted to a remote Canadian town. Overnight, Ganderland\u2019s population nearly doubled, and rather than riots in the streets there was boundless generosity and good will instead. Phoenix Theatre, WC2, to 14 September Berberian Sound Studio This could be seriously unsettling. Berberian Sound Studio is based on Peter Strickland\u2019s 2012 horror film about a bumbling sound artist gradually drawn into the eerie world he has been tasked with creating. Joel Horwood adapts and designer Tom Scutt, who has such a talent for generating dramatic tension, directs Tom Brooke in the lead role. Donmar Warehouse, WC2, to 30 March As You Like It For the first time, the RSC will tour three repertory shows \u2013 As You Like It, The Taming of the Shrew and Measure for Measure \u2013 to six regional venues. The casts have a 50/50 gender balance and, in artistic director Gregory Doran\u2019s words, \u201creflect the nation in ways never done before\u201d (ie they\u2019re not all-white). As You Like It will star David Ajao as Orlando and Lucy Phelps as the rebellious Rosalind. Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, to 31 August; touring to 4 April 2020 Equus Wunder director Ned Bennett steers Peter Shaffer\u2019s bold psychological thriller. Bennett has made his reputation by infusing contemporary plays with a restless theatricality. Now he tackles Shaffer\u2019s classic, about a troubled teenager who blinds six horses, and the psychologist who must \u201ccure\u201d him. Bennett isn\u2019t a fan of safe spaces in the theatre: this is bound to be thrilling stuff. Theatre Royal Stratford East, E15, to 23 March. Touring the UK until 19 May. SparkPlug At a venue that is genuinely invested in nurturing local talent, SparkPlug is written by Manchester actor and writer David Judge. The play is inspired by Judge\u2019s own childhood and is about a mixed-race boy with a white adoptive father. It is written as a pacey monologue and even the trailer is captivating. It\u2019s produced by new-writing company Box of Tricks, whose past collaborators include Anna Jordan, Elinor Cook and Lizzie Nunnery. Impressive. HOME, Manchester, to 23 February MG Three of the best ... dance shows Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch: Bon Voyage, Bob Only the second new work made for Pina Bausch\u2019s company since her death. Norwegian choreographer Alan Lucien \u00d8yen emulates Bausch\u2019s approach to running times with a three-and-a-half-hour performance, Bon Voyage, Bob, exploring the human condition through text, dance and theatre. Sadler\u2019s Wells, EC1, Friday 22 to 25 February Smack That (A Conversation) Rhiannon Faith makes dance-theatre that is raw, real and rough around the edges. Smack That takes on domestic violence, not just as an \u201cissue\u201d but as a lived experience: the dancers are all women who have survived physical or psychological abuse. Harlow Playhouse, Friday 22 to 23 February; touring to 4 June Phoenix Dance Theatre Haiti\u2019s Jeanguy Saintus creates his first work for a UK company, promising a new take on Stravinsky\u2019s mighty Rite of Spring, drawing on global issues. The show is a double bill with Puccini\u2019s opera Gianni Schicchi. Grand Theatre &amp; Opera House, Leeds, Saturday 17 February to 2 March; touring to 22 March LW Main composite image: Marc Brenner; Foteini Christofilopoulou; Fox Searchlight; Xavi Torrent/Redferns",

      "body": "<p>London fashion week, starting today, is shaping up to be the most eventful in recent years and it is not confined to the catwalk. On Sunday, the direct-action group Extinction Rebellion \u2013 which hit the headlines last year as they blocked five bridges over the Thames to protest against the government\u2019s approach on climate change \u2013 intends to \u201cswarm the streets calling on the industry to wake up to the climate and ecological crisis and use its influence to help to create a just and sustainable world\u201d.</p> <p>Its plan \u2013 for which it is encouraging attendees to \u201cdress as though you are going to the most glamorous funeral\u201d \u2013 is to disrupt the fashion event, rather than target specific shows. Clare Farrell, a lecturer in sustainable fashion and one of the founders of the group, told the Guardian: \u201cThe situation we are in, as a planet, is not the fault of London fashion week \u2013 but it is part of the problem\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fcaedaf5e2b41495a10c90d95dcd260ae5e6e6e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcaedaf5e2b41495a10c90d95dcd260ae5e6e6e8/0_0_3500_2331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rebellion Extinction demonstrators on Westminster bridge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebellion Extinction demonstrators on Westminster bridge in London, November 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Stillwell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A spokesperson for the British Fashion Council, which is to meet with the group to discuss the action, said that it endorses any group\u2019s \u201cright to protest peacefully\u201d, adding that it is \u201ccommitted to support businesses to do more and to develop through green growth. Our hope is that London fashion week becomes synonymous with responsible business in the years to come.\u201d</p> <p>Already the event has a heavy focus on sustainability. Mother of Pearl designer Amy Powney has partnered with BBC Earth to launch an awareness campaign over the weekend with the view to starting \u201ca movement similar to that of Blue Planet II\u201d, referring to the raised awareness of micro-plastics. As well as hosting a series of talks that will bring together BBC broadcasters and fashion industry experts to discuss how positive change can be made, the designer will also unveil a film made using footage shot by the BBC Natural History Unit. The short, which is narrated by the TV presenter Liz Bonnin (who is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/04/who-could-succeed-david-attenborough-when-he-retires\">mooted to be David Attenborough\u2019s successor</a>), will look at ways the industry can stop harming the planet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"529a439ec7ba0cb5f1c02086073a9bd7ae79bd90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/529a439ec7ba0cb5f1c02086073a9bd7ae79bd90/0_0_2732_4098/667.jpg\" alt=\"Victoria Beckham takes her bow at her London show in September 2018\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victoria Beckham takes her bow at her London show in September 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan &amp; Corina Lecca/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe main message is simply to introduce to the nation that fashion is having an alarming impact on our planet and to promote positive solutions that we can all adopt,\u201d says Powney, who is also launching a sustainable collection in collaboration with BBC Earth. \u201cI am a firm believer that we can learn from everything we do and there is no point in dwelling on what\u2019s happened but to come together now and use innovation to make changes for bettering ourselves and our industry.\u201d</p> <p>For a consecutive season, London fashion week is also fur-free. The BFC was able to confirm this after auditing the designers showing their collections on the official schedule this weekend. It currently does not prohibit the use of fur.</p> <p>As far as actual fashion goes, the event has a renewed buzz thanks to Riccardo Tisci, who will be showing his second RTW collection for Burberry, and a returning Victoria Beckham, who has claimed a coveted Sunday-morning slot. The designer, who for the first decade of her brand showed her collections in New York, made her debut on home turf for her 10th anniversary show last September and says: \u201cRight now, there\u2019s nowhere else we\u2019d rather be than here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReturning to London to show my spring/summer 2019 collection as part of LFW for the first-time last season was incredible,\u201d Beckham told the Guardian this week, adding that the new dynamics work well for her London-based design team, too. \u201cThe studio is based here, as is our flagship store, and I felt I wanted to continue to be a part of London fashion week.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BnwL4snFZlt/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "London fashion week, starting today, is shaping up to be the most eventful in recent years and it is not confined to the catwalk. On Sunday, the direct-action group Extinction Rebellion \u2013 which hit the headlines last year as they blocked five bridges over the Thames to protest against the government\u2019s approach on climate change \u2013 intends to \u201cswarm the streets calling on the industry to wake up to the climate and ecological crisis and use its influence to help to create a just and sustainable world\u201d. Its plan \u2013 for which it is encouraging attendees to \u201cdress as though you are going to the most glamorous funeral\u201d \u2013 is to disrupt the fashion event, rather than target specific shows. Clare Farrell, a lecturer in sustainable fashion and one of the founders of the group, told the Guardian: \u201cThe situation we are in, as a planet, is not the fault of London fashion week \u2013 but it is part of the problem\u201d. A spokesperson for the British Fashion Council, which is to meet with the group to discuss the action, said that it endorses any group\u2019s \u201cright to protest peacefully\u201d, adding that it is \u201ccommitted to support businesses to do more and to develop through green growth. Our hope is that London fashion week becomes synonymous with responsible business in the years to come.\u201d Already the event has a heavy focus on sustainability. Mother of Pearl designer Amy Powney has partnered with BBC Earth to launch an awareness campaign over the weekend with the view to starting \u201ca movement similar to that of Blue Planet II\u201d, referring to the raised awareness of micro-plastics. As well as hosting a series of talks that will bring together BBC broadcasters and fashion industry experts to discuss how positive change can be made, the designer will also unveil a film made using footage shot by the BBC Natural History Unit. The short, which is narrated by the TV presenter Liz Bonnin (who is mooted to be David Attenborough\u2019s successor), will look at ways the industry can stop harming the planet. \u201cThe main message is simply to introduce to the nation that fashion is having an alarming impact on our planet and to promote positive solutions that we can all adopt,\u201d says Powney, who is also launching a sustainable collection in collaboration with BBC Earth. \u201cI am a firm believer that we can learn from everything we do and there is no point in dwelling on what\u2019s happened but to come together now and use innovation to make changes for bettering ourselves and our industry.\u201d For a consecutive season, London fashion week is also fur-free. The BFC was able to confirm this after auditing the designers showing their collections on the official schedule this weekend. It currently does not prohibit the use of fur. As far as actual fashion goes, the event has a renewed buzz thanks to Riccardo Tisci, who will be showing his second RTW collection for Burberry, and a returning Victoria Beckham, who has claimed a coveted Sunday-morning slot. The designer, who for the first decade of her brand showed her collections in New York, made her debut on home turf for her 10th anniversary show last September and says: \u201cRight now, there\u2019s nowhere else we\u2019d rather be than here.\u201d \u201cReturning to London to show my spring/summer 2019 collection as part of LFW for the first-time last season was incredible,\u201d Beckham told the Guardian this week, adding that the new dynamics work well for her London-based design team, too. \u201cThe studio is based here, as is our flagship store, and I felt I wanted to continue to be a part of London fashion week.\u201d Other highlights on the schedule include Anya Hindmarch, who, after her Chubby Cloud immersion last season, is planning an indoor climbing frame installation called the Weave Project; the Fashion East collective, which welcomes CSM-graduate Gareth Wrighton; and sustainable pioneer Bethany Williams, who has been announced as the second recipient of the Queen\u2019s Award, which will be given by the Duchess of Cornwall on Tuesday.

That means they can buy some new training bibs, take muddy kits to the launderette after every game, make sure that everyone has shin pads, get enough half-time oranges for the whole team and give <strong>Son Heung-min</strong> a new contract worth a whopping \u00a3150,000 a week. Hooray! Let the good times roll! </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/14/sergio-ramos-champions-league-ban-intentional-booking-ajax-real-madrid-bale\">Sergio Ramos facing Champions League ban for intentional booking at Ajax</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What\u2019s more, it even means Mauricio Pochettino might be allowed to sign a new player. Just the one, mind you, we don\u2019t want to go crazy. But still, giddy times for Pochettino, who has settled on rivalling <strong>Arsenal</strong> for Milan\u2019s <strong>Suso</strong>. The former Liverpool midfielder is going for \u00a335m. The north London rivals plan to start the bidding at a cool \u00a33.5m. </p> <p>Elsewhere in Italy, <strong>Juventus</strong> are said to be plotting a raid for Liverpool\u2019s <strong>Mohamed Salah</strong>. They reckon \u00a344m will do the job if they also chuck in Paulo Dybala. The Mill reckons there\u2019s more chance of Liverpool building a statue of Demba Ba outside Anfield than this one happening. </p> <p>Staying with Juve, <strong>Chelsea</strong> reckon they make <strong>Gonzalo Higua\u00edn</strong>\u2019s loan deal permanent for less than the \u00a331.8m they agreed with the Italian giants. Failing that, they will turn their attention to Benfica\u2019s <strong>Luka Jovic</strong>, who could be theirs for \u00a339.7m. Don\u2019t think too much about the maths. </p> <p>While <strong>Wolves</strong> think about signing <strong>Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez </strong>on a permanent basis from Benfica and challenging <strong>Everton</strong> for Porto\u2019s <strong>Yacine Brahimi</strong>, <strong>Manchester City</strong> are feeling <br>chipper after learning that Barcelona cannot afford to pay \u00a375m for <strong>Matthis De Ligt</strong>. That leaves City as the clear favourites to sign the Ajax centre-back. Another win for the little guy. </p> <p>If a certain someone was still at Old Trafford, <strong>Manchester United</strong>\u2019s top target this summer would have been Newcastle\u2019s <strong>Jamaal Lascelles</strong>. But with Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r at the helm all the focus is on splurging \u00a3100m on Benfica wonderkid<strong> Joao Felix</strong>, which could give Alexis S\u00e1nchez even more time to spend with his dogs.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Now that Tottenham no longer plan to spend half of their cash on an executive cheese room at the new White Hart Lane, they can make more room in their budget for football stuff. That means they can buy some new training bibs, take muddy kits to the launderette after every game, make sure that everyone has shin pads, get enough half-time oranges for the whole team and give Son Heung-min a new contract worth a whopping \u00a3150,000 a week. Hooray! Let the good times roll! What\u2019s more, it even means Mauricio Pochettino might be allowed to sign a new player. Just the one, mind you, we don\u2019t want to go crazy. But still, giddy times for Pochettino, who has settled on rivalling Arsenal for Milan\u2019s Suso. The former Liverpool midfielder is going for \u00a335m. The north London rivals plan to start the bidding at a cool \u00a33.5m. Elsewhere in Italy, Juventus are said to be plotting a raid for Liverpool\u2019s Mohamed Salah. They reckon \u00a344m will do the job if they also chuck in Paulo Dybala. The Mill reckons there\u2019s more chance of Liverpool building a statue of Demba Ba outside Anfield than this one happening. Staying with Juve, Chelsea reckon they make Gonzalo Higua\u00edn\u2019s loan deal permanent for less than the \u00a331.8m they agreed with the Italian giants. Failing that, they will turn their attention to Benfica\u2019s Luka Jovic, who could be theirs for \u00a339.7m. Don\u2019t think too much about the maths. While Wolves think about signing Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez on a permanent basis from Benfica and challenging Everton for Porto\u2019s Yacine Brahimi, Manchester City are feeling chipper after learning that Barcelona cannot afford to pay \u00a375m for Matthis De Ligt. That leaves City as the clear favourites to sign the Ajax centre-back. Another win for the little guy. If a certain someone was still at Old Trafford, Manchester United\u2019s top target this summer would have been Newcastle\u2019s Jamaal Lascelles. But with Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r at the helm all the focus is on splurging \u00a3100m on Benfica wonderkid Joao Felix, which could give Alexis S\u00e1nchez even more time to spend with his dogs.",

Maybe it\u2019s the infinite connectivity of the internet erasing the sensation of isolation, but films such as Eighth Grade, Edge of Seventeen and their ilk have developed a passive relationship to their provincial suburban setting, regarding it as dull but harmless.

In 1989, the postwar advent of planned communities was recent enough that humanity still fretted over whether relocating out of the rough-and-tumble city would turn vital men and women into sleepy husbands, wives and parents. Dante\u2019s kooky satire focuses on characters convincing themselves they\u2019re not neutered beta males by unearthing the morass of repressed weirdness believed to be squirming under the handsomely manicured exterior of small-town America. They\u2019re eventually proven right, that all their suspicions about something extraordinary busting up their humdrum day-to-day turned out to be well founded. Dante\u2019s wickedest stroke was showing just how badly they needed that to be true.</p> <p>He found a perfect manifestation of family man restlessness in a young Tom Hanks, coming in hot off Big as an everyman comic presence a decade or so out from his current status as Hollywood\u2019s unofficial heroic dad. When we meet Hanks as Ray Peterson, he\u2019s just decided to use his week off from a vague office job (another symbol of the suburbs\u2019 soul-sapping conformity) for a staycation years before the phrase would be coined. Rather than go somewhere exotic, he\u2019d rather commit himself to finding something novel in his own cul-de-sac. He\u2019s taking a break all right, but only from the monotony.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c5c2338ffe65247815c12cd5261176c29986125d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5c2338ffe65247815c12cd5261176c29986125d/0_0_2816_1882/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce Dern, Tom Hanks, Corey Feldman and Wendy Schaal in The \u2018Burbs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bruce Dern, Tom Hanks, Corey Feldman and Wendy Schaal in The \u2018Burbs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His interests have been piqued by the Klopecks next door, the eastern European undertones of their family name only the second-most suspicious thing about them in Ray\u2019s estimation. He\u2019s more concerned by the bizarre, inexplicable behaviors he glimpses when they think he isn\u2019t looking: mysterious lights and noises coming from the basement at all hours, digging up their back yard in the middle of a rain storm, car trips all the way from the garage to the curb in the dead of night. Something must be up, and Ray assembles a ragtag crew of simpatico paranoiacs including Rick Ducommun a more pronounced man-child and Bruce Dern as a grizzled, screwloose veteran. Ray clearly relishes the opportunity to play amateur detective with his buddies, barely concealing his underlying sentiments when he sends his wife (a fetching Carrie Fisher!) and son away \u201cfor their own safety\u201d.</p> <p>The key to unlocking the film\u2019s intent may very well rest with Corey Feldman, who appeared as punk teen Ricky Butler just as his mainstream popularity began to wane. Though he joins Ray and the gang on their harebrained mission to unravel the enigma next door, Ricky maintains a Gen Xer\u2019s sense of ironic remove, mostly just amused at the adults\u2019 clumsy efforts to assert control over the situation. He\u2019s having plenty of fun coming along for the ride, but like Dante, one gets the sense he doesn\u2019t unquestioningly share Ray\u2019s headspace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d313ee6e1902803f3d277273b2640bfc10b52854\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d313ee6e1902803f3d277273b2640bfc10b52854/0_0_3300_2536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hanks and Carrie Fisher in The Burbs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"768\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hanks and Carrie Fisher in The \u2018Burbs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Feldman couldn\u2019t possibly take this all less seriously; just look at a recently unearthed <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/ao2fhk/the_legendary_dick_miller_putting_corey_feldman/\">behind-the-scenes clip</a> of a jittery Feldman goofing around before one take, only to be chastised with a \u201cshut the fuck up, kid, we\u2019re trying to do some acting\u201d from the dearly departed character actor Dick Miller. Feldman winds up like he\u2019s about to sock Miller in the teeth, either playacting the hot-tempered adolescent the press painted him as or just barely suppressing a sincere impulse. Either way, he makes it clear that the age difference has placed him and his character out of joint from the oldsters trying to work. Feldman sees how silly this all is.</p> <p>Dante has always had a cheeky, subversive side to his games in the playpens of horror and sci-fi, and he has his fun puncturing the masculine ego as all its hot air gets farted out. Because this is a movie, Ray and his cohort must eventually be proven right about the sinister business taking place at the Klopeck residence, but we\u2019re meant to recognize no small measure of ridiculousness in their clumsy investigation. They have no idea what they\u2019re doing, essentially stumbling onto the truth \u2013 as Claire Foy so succinctly put it in the recent First Man: \u201cYou\u2019re just a bunch of <em>boys</em>.\u201d Ever the forward thinker, Dante had already gotten over the yawning existential void of the suburbs, and he was prepared to have a chuckle at the expense of those who hadn\u2019t.</p> <p>In his <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-burbs-1989\">review</a> of the original release, dean of American film critics Roger Ebert dinged what he perceived as a lack of historical context: \u201cIt seems recycled out of fairly ancient ideas of what the suburbs are really like (I kept expecting to see Dennis the Menace or Mr Wilson wandering down the street).\u201d Sincerest apologies to the Ebert estate, but surely the director knew what he was doing. A full decade before American Beauty picked up a best picture statuette for portraying the suburbs as a hellacious prison of middle age, Dante had made his peace with them as a locus of unease for aging Boomers nervous about their generation\u2019s slide out of radicalism. He\u2019s writing the neighborhood as an idea and social ecosystem rather than a geography, making the distinction between actual houses and the rows of colonial facades lined up like an old west soundstage \u2013 the difference between the suburbs and the \u2018burbs.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s the old joke about the fish that says \u201cHey, how\u2019s the water today?\u201d to a second fish, who replies: \u201cWhat the hell is water?\u201d This is how the movies have come to occupy the suburbs, as a non-space defined by how easy it is to forget it\u2019s anyplace at all. Maybe it\u2019s the infinite connectivity of the internet erasing the sensation of isolation, but films such as Eighth Grade, Edge of Seventeen and their ilk have developed a passive relationship to their provincial suburban setting, regarding it as dull but harmless. Even the films about stagnating adulthood \u2013 see: Game Night (no, really, see Game Night) \u2013 draw their unease from within, rather than their surroundings. Joe Dante\u2019s The \u2018Burbs, which will reach its 30th anniversary milestone later this week, offers modern viewers a portal back to the previous era\u2019s understanding of suburban living as a collection of loaded cultural signifiers. In 1989, the postwar advent of planned communities was recent enough that humanity still fretted over whether relocating out of the rough-and-tumble city would turn vital men and women into sleepy husbands, wives and parents. Dante\u2019s kooky satire focuses on characters convincing themselves they\u2019re not neutered beta males by unearthing the morass of repressed weirdness believed to be squirming under the handsomely manicured exterior of small-town America. They\u2019re eventually proven right, that all their suspicions about something extraordinary busting up their humdrum day-to-day turned out to be well founded. Dante\u2019s wickedest stroke was showing just how badly they needed that to be true. He found a perfect manifestation of family man restlessness in a young Tom Hanks, coming in hot off Big as an everyman comic presence a decade or so out from his current status as Hollywood\u2019s unofficial heroic dad. When we meet Hanks as Ray Peterson, he\u2019s just decided to use his week off from a vague office job (another symbol of the suburbs\u2019 soul-sapping conformity) for a staycation years before the phrase would be coined. Rather than go somewhere exotic, he\u2019d rather commit himself to finding something novel in his own cul-de-sac. He\u2019s taking a break all right, but only from the monotony. His interests have been piqued by the Klopecks next door, the eastern European undertones of their family name only the second-most suspicious thing about them in Ray\u2019s estimation. He\u2019s more concerned by the bizarre, inexplicable behaviors he glimpses when they think he isn\u2019t looking: mysterious lights and noises coming from the basement at all hours, digging up their back yard in the middle of a rain storm, car trips all the way from the garage to the curb in the dead of night. Something must be up, and Ray assembles a ragtag crew of simpatico paranoiacs including Rick Ducommun a more pronounced man-child and Bruce Dern as a grizzled, screwloose veteran. Ray clearly relishes the opportunity to play amateur detective with his buddies, barely concealing his underlying sentiments when he sends his wife (a fetching Carrie Fisher!) and son away \u201cfor their own safety\u201d. The key to unlocking the film\u2019s intent may very well rest with Corey Feldman, who appeared as punk teen Ricky Butler just as his mainstream popularity began to wane. Though he joins Ray and the gang on their harebrained mission to unravel the enigma next door, Ricky maintains a Gen Xer\u2019s sense of ironic remove, mostly just amused at the adults\u2019 clumsy efforts to assert control over the situation. He\u2019s having plenty of fun coming along for the ride, but like Dante, one gets the sense he doesn\u2019t unquestioningly share Ray\u2019s headspace. Feldman couldn\u2019t possibly take this all less seriously; just look at a recently unearthed behind-the-scenes clip of a jittery Feldman goofing around before one take, only to be chastised with a \u201cshut the fuck up, kid, we\u2019re trying to do some acting\u201d from the dearly departed character actor Dick Miller. Feldman winds up like he\u2019s about to sock Miller in the teeth, either playacting the hot-tempered adolescent the press painted him as or just barely suppressing a sincere impulse. Either way, he makes it clear that the age difference has placed him and his character out of joint from the oldsters trying to work. Feldman sees how silly this all is. Dante has always had a cheeky, subversive side to his games in the playpens of horror and sci-fi, and he has his fun puncturing the masculine ego as all its hot air gets farted out. Because this is a movie, Ray and his cohort must eventually be proven right about the sinister business taking place at the Klopeck residence, but we\u2019re meant to recognize no small measure of ridiculousness in their clumsy investigation. They have no idea what they\u2019re doing, essentially stumbling onto the truth \u2013 as Claire Foy so succinctly put it in the recent First Man: \u201cYou\u2019re just a bunch of boys.\u201d Ever the forward thinker, Dante had already gotten over the yawning existential void of the suburbs, and he was prepared to have a chuckle at the expense of those who hadn\u2019t. In his review of the original release, dean of American film critics Roger Ebert dinged what he perceived as a lack of historical context: \u201cIt seems recycled out of fairly ancient ideas of what the suburbs are really like (I kept expecting to see Dennis the Menace or Mr Wilson wandering down the street).\u201d Sincerest apologies to the Ebert estate, but surely the director knew what he was doing. A full decade before American Beauty picked up a best picture statuette for portraying the suburbs as a hellacious prison of middle age, Dante had made his peace with them as a locus of unease for aging Boomers nervous about their generation\u2019s slide out of radicalism. He\u2019s writing the neighborhood as an idea and social ecosystem rather than a geography, making the distinction between actual houses and the rows of colonial facades lined up like an old west soundstage \u2013 the difference between the suburbs and the \u2018burbs.",

It\u2019s a contemporary black and white. Black and white was part of the DNA of the film.\u201d</p> <p>Roma was filmed in colour and converted to black and white in post-production, with the tonal values <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2018/11/alfonso-cuarons-black-and-white-roma-was-a-cinematic-master-stroke-1202021233/\" title=\"\">manipulated</a> to achieve the desired look. This is how most black and white films are made now, though Alexander Payne, whose Nebraska was nominated for best film and cinematography in 2014, was pressured by his distributors into making a colour version as well as his preferred black and white one, for TV outlets. \u201cI hope no one ever sees it,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething about the screenplay, the austerity of it, the austerity of the people and the landscapes it would evoke just felt black and white to me.\u201d</p> <p>The Artist, in which a silent movie actor struggles to adjust to the coming of sound, is, like Roma, set in the past, but the choice of black and white also panders to a popular misconception about silent movies. In fact, 80% of films released in the early 1920s were in some form of colour \u2013 either early Technicolor, or tinted, or toned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b481994b02323696524e6735e9fc3de4f66fa12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b481994b02323696524e6735e9fc3de4f66fa12/0_0_2709_1806/1000.jpg\" alt=\"B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo as Peppy Miller in The Artist, which won an Oscar for best picture in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo as Peppy Miller in The Artist, which won an Oscar for best picture in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then, as talkies took over from silents in the late 20s and early 30s, the use of colour declined. Dye processes interfered with audio recording, and three-strip Technicolor was cumbersome (requiring three separate negatives), expensive (the switch to sound coincided with the Great Depression), and the slowness of the film stock required such bright lighting that some actors claimed it caused permanent damage to their eyes.</p> <p>In 1947, only 12% of Hollywood movies were filmed in colour, but by 1954 that had jumped to more than 50%. This figure wasn\u2019t just boosted by the big screen\u2019s attempts to present a spectacular alternative to television, but by Kodak\u2019s introduction of the more versatile, less cumbersome Eastmancolor, a <a href=\"https://the-artifice.com/history-of-colour-film/\" title=\"\">one-strip colour</a> negative process.</p> <p>Before The Artist, you have to go back to 1994 to find a black-and-white best picture winner. Unlike Roma and The Artist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/06/schindlers-list-25th-anniversary-steven-spielberg-holocaust\" title=\"\">Schindler\u2019s List</a> was shot on black and white film stock. <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/cinematographer-janusz-kaminski-warns-directors-photography-are-losing-control-images-they-shoot-1101082\" title=\"\">Janusz Kaminski</a>, whose cinematography won the film another Oscar, says he was aiming for a documentary-like quality for the images. \u201cThe Holocaust was life without light,\u201d said his director, Steven Spielberg. \u201cFor me the symbol of life is colour.

Although if either of those end up winning, you probably won\u2019t be able to watch the award live, because <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/oscars-ceremony-changes-spark-fear-outrage-crafts-members-1133357\" title=\"\">the Academy has controversially decreed</a> that the presentation of this year\u2019s awards for craft categories (cinematography among them, one assumes) will be relegated to the commercial breaks.</p> <p>Roma and Cold War were both rapturously reviewed. Roma was praised as \u201can immersive view of the past\u201d, and \u201cgorgeous, deeply immersive\u201d; Cold War as an \u201cimmersive portrait of rural Poland\u201d and \u201cone of the most immersive cinematic experiences I got to witness in 2018\u201d. Another 2018 film praised for its immersive qualities (although it missed the filing deadline for the Academy Awards) was Peter Jackson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/16/they-shall-not-grow-old-review-first-world-war-peter-jackson\" title=\"\">They Shall Not Grow Old</a>, in which old footage of British soldiers at the Western Front in the first world war was restored, and the frame rate tweaked to avoid jerkiness. Reviewers marvelled at how the colourisation enabled them to connect with the men in the footage. \u201cA fully immersive event, in which we understand the experience of WWI soldiers as we never have before,\u201d said <a href=\"http://thewrap.com/\" title=\"\">the Wrap</a>. \u201cThe soldiers are no longer just images on a screen \u2013 they\u2019re real people\u201d (Empire). The Daily Mail also praised the documentary, and dismissed black and white as \u201ca medium that is automatically distancing and draining\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ecc0f815074e6212f3e5a9cefb885f05caaf8b41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecc0f815074e6212f3e5a9cefb885f05caaf8b41/0_0_4541_3406/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cold War, praised as an \u2018immersive portrait of rural Poland\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cold War, praised as an \u2018immersive portrait of rural Poland\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So is black and white immersive or isn\u2019t it? I consider the inference that we can\u2019t relate to people in black-and-white films patronising and presumptuous \u2013 and obviously wrong, when you take Roma into account. And while the restoration, dubbing and frame-tweaking in They Shall Not Grow Old lend immediacy, I found the colourisation a step too far \u2013 distracting and offputting, the very opposite of immersive. The unnatural homogeneity of the flesh tones reminded me of the kitsch hand-tinted imagery of French artists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2017/feb/17/40-years-of-pierre-et-gilles-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Pierre et Gilles</a>.</p> <p>On social media, well-meaning folk often post colourised portraits by masters of black-and-white Hollywood glamour photography, such as <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryPorn/comments/7aa1j5/actress_norma_shearer_by_george_hurrell_1939/\" title=\"\">George Hurrell</a> or <a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/about/photographs-collection/national-photographic-record/the-man-who-shot-garbo\" title=\"\">Clarence Sinclair Bull</a>. This vexes me not just because adding colour to someone\u2019s work without their permission is disrespectful to the original artist, treating their images as some sort of adult colouring book, but because it encourages viewers to look on black and white as inferior \u2013 as an absence of colour, rather than as a medium in its own right. As anyone who has ever had to prepare colour pictures for monochrome printing will be aware, contrast and tone have to be manipulated so the image doesn\u2019t end up as a grey smudge. Black and white is a different beast, with its own values and techniques, which are not necessarily compatible with colour reproduction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ead32b5b1f97e268336c004134b7bd9ac7c4968a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ead32b5b1f97e268336c004134b7bd9ac7c4968a/0_0_1989_1365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine in The Apartment, which lifted the best picture Oscar in 1961.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine in The Apartment, which lifted the best picture Oscar in 1961.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/United Artists</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You have only to look at the breathtaking use of black and white in the work of cinematographers such as James Wong Howe (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051036/\" title=\"\">Sweet Smell of Success</a>, <a href=\"https://theasc.com/magazine/nov97/seconds/pg1.htm\" title=\"\">Seconds</a>) or John Alton (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041198/plotsummary\" title=\"\">Border Incident</a>, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047878/\" title=\"\">The Big Combo</a>) to realise it is a long way from being a poor person\u2019s alternative to polychrome. (Ironically, it would be for his colour work \u2013 in the ballet sequence in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043278/\" title=\"\">An American in Paris</a> \u2013 that Alton would win a best cinematography Oscar in 1952.) Even Hollywood seemed to recognise this; from 1939 to 1967, there were separate Academy Awards for colour cinematography and black-and-white cinematography.</p> <p>Cinematographers had to have a working knowledge of how colours translated into black and white. <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030287/\" title=\"\">Jezebel</a>, an antebellum romance from 1938 often considered as Bette Davis\u2019s consolation prize after her failure to land the role of Scarlett O\u2019Hara in Gone With the Wind, features a scene in which the heroine scandalises New Orleans society by wearing a red dress to a ball at which unmarried women like herself are expected to wear white. Since the film is in black and white, the dialogue has to tip us off: \u201cYou know you can\u2019t wear red to the Olympus ball!\u201d But the dress itself was actually bronze-coloured, which looked more \u201cred\u201d in monochrome.</p> <p>Red can be tricky. Alfred Hitchcock used watered-down chocolate syrup for the blood in the Psycho shower scene, while Akira Kurosawa used carbonated chocolate sauce for the explosion of gore at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkkF6Zz67TE\" title=\"\">climax of Sanjuro</a> (a compressor hose malfunction caused a bigger gush than anticipated, but the director kept the results in the finished film). The castle set of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019254/\" title=\"\">Carl Theodor Dreyer\u2019s The Passion of Joan of Arc</a> was painted pink, so it would show up as grey on the finished black-and-white film.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3349d7f3a6f6c4e23f08aa7f5e2f6f929a94583\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3349d7f3a6f6c4e23f08aa7f5e2f6f929a94583/0_74_2688_1613/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Susan Harrison and Burt Lancaster in James Wong Howe\u2019s Sweet Smell of Success.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Susan Harrison and Burt Lancaster in James Wong Howe\u2019s Sweet Smell of Success.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Blue Dolphin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Max Factor developed an entire range of makeup specifically for black-and-white television. If, on screen, the lipsticks looked red, in real life, they were green, while those of us who had grown up with black-and-white TV were shocked (and thrilled) when, many years later, we finally got to see Endora\u2019s garish blue eyeshadow in Bewitched. Meanwhile, one of the most brilliant uses of colour manipulation in a black-and-white movie is Fredric March\u2019s transformation in Rouben Mamoulian\u2019s 1931 film Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqqZ0yFqY04\" title=\"\">all done with colour filters</a>.</p> <p>It does audiences a disservice to assume (as the big studios surely do) that they won\u2019t tolerate movies in black and white. Roma and Cold War might be catering more to an arthouse crowd, but black-and-white versions of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/12/mad-max-fury-road-black-white\" title=\"\">Mad Max: Fury Road</a>, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/logan-black-white-or-color/\" title=\"\">Logan</a> and <a href=\"https://horrorfreaknews.com/mist-black-white-completely-different-viewing-experience/22036\" title=\"\">The Mist</a> have been hailed by fans of these films as superior to the colour releases. At the same time, the modern trend is to digitally drain the colour out of movies, leaving a desaturated look only a few tinges away from monochrome.</p> <p>Even if the ratio of monochrome to colour releases will never get back to 50:50, black and white is here to stay, in one way or another. It is just too valuable a tool not to. From The Wizard of Oz to The Purple Rose of Cairo to Matinee to Casino Royale, Memento or Wonderstruck, alternating colour with black-and-white footage is one of the simplest and most effective ways for film-makers to differentiate between past and present, reality and fantasy, films within films. Not to mention this world and the next.

      "bodyText": "If Roma takes home the best picture Oscar in nine days\u2019 time, it will be only eight years since another black-and-white film achieved the same feat \u2013 The Artist in 2012. \u201cI wanted to do a modern film that looks into the past,\u201d Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, Roma\u2019s writer, director and cinematographer told Emmanuel Lubezki, Oscar-winning director of photography on Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Gravity. \u201cIt\u2019s not a vintage black and white. It\u2019s a contemporary black and white. Black and white was part of the DNA of the film.\u201d Roma was filmed in colour and converted to black and white in post-production, with the tonal values manipulated to achieve the desired look. This is how most black and white films are made now, though Alexander Payne, whose Nebraska was nominated for best film and cinematography in 2014, was pressured by his distributors into making a colour version as well as his preferred black and white one, for TV outlets. \u201cI hope no one ever sees it,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething about the screenplay, the austerity of it, the austerity of the people and the landscapes it would evoke just felt black and white to me.\u201d The Artist, in which a silent movie actor struggles to adjust to the coming of sound, is, like Roma, set in the past, but the choice of black and white also panders to a popular misconception about silent movies. In fact, 80% of films released in the early 1920s were in some form of colour \u2013 either early Technicolor, or tinted, or toned. Then, as talkies took over from silents in the late 20s and early 30s, the use of colour declined. Dye processes interfered with audio recording, and three-strip Technicolor was cumbersome (requiring three separate negatives), expensive (the switch to sound coincided with the Great Depression), and the slowness of the film stock required such bright lighting that some actors claimed it caused permanent damage to their eyes. In 1947, only 12% of Hollywood movies were filmed in colour, but by 1954 that had jumped to more than 50%. This figure wasn\u2019t just boosted by the big screen\u2019s attempts to present a spectacular alternative to television, but by Kodak\u2019s introduction of the more versatile, less cumbersome Eastmancolor, a one-strip colour negative process. Before The Artist, you have to go back to 1994 to find a black-and-white best picture winner. Unlike Roma and The Artist, Schindler\u2019s List was shot on black and white film stock. Janusz Kaminski, whose cinematography won the film another Oscar, says he was aiming for a documentary-like quality for the images. \u201cThe Holocaust was life without light,\u201d said his director, Steven Spielberg. \u201cFor me the symbol of life is colour. That\u2019s why a film about the Holocaust has to be in black and white.\u201d Spielberg\u2019s film isn\u2019t wholly monochrome; it features a dash of red, in the form of the little girl in the red raincoat, a symbolic victim of the liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w ghetto. The last 100% black and white best picture winner before The Artist was Billy Wilder\u2019s The Apartment at the 1961 awards. Besides best film, Roma has also been nominated for cinematography alongside another black-and-white film, Cold War, directed and co-written by Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski. Although if either of those end up winning, you probably won\u2019t be able to watch the award live, because the Academy has controversially decreed that the presentation of this year\u2019s awards for craft categories (cinematography among them, one assumes) will be relegated to the commercial breaks. Roma and Cold War were both rapturously reviewed. Roma was praised as \u201can immersive view of the past\u201d, and \u201cgorgeous, deeply immersive\u201d; Cold War as an \u201cimmersive portrait of rural Poland\u201d and \u201cone of the most immersive cinematic experiences I got to witness in 2018\u201d. Another 2018 film praised for its immersive qualities (although it missed the filing deadline for the Academy Awards) was Peter Jackson\u2019s They Shall Not Grow Old, in which old footage of British soldiers at the Western Front in the first world war was restored, and the frame rate tweaked to avoid jerkiness. Reviewers marvelled at how the colourisation enabled them to connect with the men in the footage. \u201cA fully immersive event, in which we understand the experience of WWI soldiers as we never have before,\u201d said the Wrap. \u201cThe soldiers are no longer just images on a screen \u2013 they\u2019re real people\u201d (Empire). The Daily Mail also praised the documentary, and dismissed black and white as \u201ca medium that is automatically distancing and draining\u201d. So is black and white immersive or isn\u2019t it? I consider the inference that we can\u2019t relate to people in black-and-white films patronising and presumptuous \u2013 and obviously wrong, when you take Roma into account. And while the restoration, dubbing and frame-tweaking in They Shall Not Grow Old lend immediacy, I found the colourisation a step too far \u2013 distracting and offputting, the very opposite of immersive. The unnatural homogeneity of the flesh tones reminded me of the kitsch hand-tinted imagery of French artists Pierre et Gilles. On social media, well-meaning folk often post colourised portraits by masters of black-and-white Hollywood glamour photography, such as George Hurrell or Clarence Sinclair Bull. This vexes me not just because adding colour to someone\u2019s work without their permission is disrespectful to the original artist, treating their images as some sort of adult colouring book, but because it encourages viewers to look on black and white as inferior \u2013 as an absence of colour, rather than as a medium in its own right. As anyone who has ever had to prepare colour pictures for monochrome printing will be aware, contrast and tone have to be manipulated so the image doesn\u2019t end up as a grey smudge. Black and white is a different beast, with its own values and techniques, which are not necessarily compatible with colour reproduction. You have only to look at the breathtaking use of black and white in the work of cinematographers such as James Wong Howe (Sweet Smell of Success, Seconds) or John Alton (Border Incident, The Big Combo) to realise it is a long way from being a poor person\u2019s alternative to polychrome. (Ironically, it would be for his colour work \u2013 in the ballet sequence in An American in Paris \u2013 that Alton would win a best cinematography Oscar in 1952.) Even Hollywood seemed to recognise this; from 1939 to 1967, there were separate Academy Awards for colour cinematography and black-and-white cinematography. Cinematographers had to have a working knowledge of how colours translated into black and white. Jezebel, an antebellum romance from 1938 often considered as Bette Davis\u2019s consolation prize after her failure to land the role of Scarlett O\u2019Hara in Gone With the Wind, features a scene in which the heroine scandalises New Orleans society by wearing a red dress to a ball at which unmarried women like herself are expected to wear white. Since the film is in black and white, the dialogue has to tip us off: \u201cYou know you can\u2019t wear red to the Olympus ball!\u201d But the dress itself was actually bronze-coloured, which looked more \u201cred\u201d in monochrome. Red can be tricky. Alfred Hitchcock used watered-down chocolate syrup for the blood in the Psycho shower scene, while Akira Kurosawa used carbonated chocolate sauce for the explosion of gore at the climax of Sanjuro (a compressor hose malfunction caused a bigger gush than anticipated, but the director kept the results in the finished film). The castle set of Carl Theodor Dreyer\u2019s The Passion of Joan of Arc was painted pink, so it would show up as grey on the finished black-and-white film. Max Factor developed an entire range of makeup specifically for black-and-white television. If, on screen, the lipsticks looked red, in real life, they were green, while those of us who had grown up with black-and-white TV were shocked (and thrilled) when, many years later, we finally got to see Endora\u2019s garish blue eyeshadow in Bewitched. Meanwhile, one of the most brilliant uses of colour manipulation in a black-and-white movie is Fredric March\u2019s transformation in Rouben Mamoulian\u2019s 1931 film Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde \u2013 all done with colour filters. It does audiences a disservice to assume (as the big studios surely do) that they won\u2019t tolerate movies in black and white. Roma and Cold War might be catering more to an arthouse crowd, but black-and-white versions of Mad Max: Fury Road, Logan and The Mist have been hailed by fans of these films as superior to the colour releases. At the same time, the modern trend is to digitally drain the colour out of movies, leaving a desaturated look only a few tinges away from monochrome. Even if the ratio of monochrome to colour releases will never get back to 50:50, black and white is here to stay, in one way or another. It is just too valuable a tool not to. From The Wizard of Oz to The Purple Rose of Cairo to Matinee to Casino Royale, Memento or Wonderstruck, alternating colour with black-and-white footage is one of the simplest and most effective ways for film-makers to differentiate between past and present, reality and fantasy, films within films. Not to mention this world and the next. To quote Conductor 71 in A Matter of Life and Death: \u201cOne is starved for Technicolor up there.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The fashion director of the Brazilian edition of Vogue has resigned after photos from her 50th birthday party drew criticism for evoking colonial depictions of slavery. Images from the party showed Donata Meirelles, who is white, sitting on a throne-like seat flanked by four black women dressed in white at the celebration in Bahia, the Brazilian state with the largest black population. Critics compared the women\u2019s clothes to the white uniforms worn by house slaves, and pointed out the chair\u2019s similarity to a cadeira de sinh\u00e1, an ornate chair for slave masters. \u201cThe black women were used as objects to create an exotic scene,\u201d said Stephanie Ribeiro, the author of the #BlackGirlMagic column in the Brazilian edition of Marie Claire. \u201cIt\u2019s reminiscent of colonialism and romanticizes those times. She was recreating the image where whites are superior and blacks are dehumanized.\u201d A famous Brazilian singer, Elza Soares, wrote on Instagram: \u201cThink about how much you can hurt people, their memories, the plight of their people, when you choose a theme to \u2018spice up\u2019 a happy moment in your life.\u201d One Instagram user juxtaposed the image of Meirelles with an archival photo of a woman from the Costa Carvalho family on a sedan chair with two slaves. \u201cThe first one is from 1860,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe second one is actually from 2019.\u201d The day after the party, Meirelles responded on Instagram, saying that the chair was actually an artifact from the Afro-Brazilian folk religion candombl\u00e9, and the clothes were traditional Bahian party attire. \u201cEven so, if I caused any different impressions, I am sorry,\u201d she said. On Wednesday, Meirelles announced that she would resign from her position at Vogue. In a statement on Instagram, the magazine said: \u201cVogue Brasil profoundly regrets what happened and hopes that the debate that has been generated serves as a learning experience.\u201d Vogue said it was creating a panel of activists and academics to help create content to combat inequalities. But the move was dismissed by Ribeiro. \u201cThey should just hire black people to work at Vogue Brasil, not create a forum for black activists to act like babysitters telling them whether something is racist or not,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "Thirty-eight years after he lost his mother, five siblings, and five nieces and nephews during El Salvador\u2019s brutal civil war, Santos Alvaro Pereira still breaks down in tears when he recalls their murder. Pereira\u2019s relatives were among nearly 1,000 civilians \u2013 including 533 children \u2013 who were slaughtered by US-trained troops in and around the village of El Mozote in December 1981. Eighteen former army officers now face trial for crimes against humanity and other charges related to the massacre. This week, the memory of El Mozote \u2013 and the legacy of US cold war-era intervention in Central America \u2013 was evoked in Washington DC as the Democratic representative Ilhan Omar grilled Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy to Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, about US policies in Latin America. But for survivors of the massacre, the pain has never gone away. On Thursday, Pereira, 59, had hoped to finally learn the whereabouts of his sister Maria, her husband, and their five children \u2013 murdered at the ages of 10, nine, seven, five, and three \u2013 when forensic experts investigated a potential mass grave at the village. A court had ordered the exhumation after a local resident, Florent\u00edn Ramos, 26, and his father noticed children\u2019s clothes and bone fragments in the topsoil when they went to plant cacao trees. As the team of anthropologists sifted through the dirt on a hillside outside the village, Pereira said through sobs that he still hoped to give his relatives a proper burial. But after about an hour, the Argentinian forensic expert Silvana Turner, who led the exhumation, said that bones at the site were not human. Pereira hardened when he heard that the day would bring no answers. \u201cWe have to keep looking,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want justice.\u201d The massacre came in the early stages of a civil war between leftwing rebels and the US-backed government that eventually claimed 75,000 lives \u2013 most at the hands of state forces, according to a United Nations truth commission. At El Mozote, soldiers from the Atlacatl Battalion \u2013 an elite counterinsurgency unit trained, armed, and funded by the US \u2013 lined up, interrogated, tortured, and executed villagers. They started with the men before turning to the women and children, gang-raping women and girls. The army also burned houses and crops as part of a \u201cscorched earth\u201d campaign against guerrilla strongholds, where all villagers were suspected of collaborating with the rebels. An amnesty law passed shortly after the 1992 peace deal shielded the perpetrators from prosecution for more than two decades. The supreme court declared the blanket amnesty unconstitutional in 2016, opening the door to bring civil war-era human rights crimes to trial. El Mozote now serves as a test case. \u201c[The trial] could transform Salvadoran society by saying that crimes against humanity and grave violations are human rights will not go unpunished,\u201d said El Salvador\u2019s deputy human rights ombudsperson, Carlos Rodriguez, standing beside the exhumation site. \u201cThis would send an important message to current and future governments.\u201d The trial is also likely to cast a spotlight on the US role in the conflict, at a time when Abrams was assistant secretary of state for human rights. After El Mozote, Abrams dismissed reports of a massacre as a propaganda ploy by leftist rebels and their allies in human rights groups. In a 1982 Senate foreign relations committee hearing, Abrams claimed reports of the death toll were \u201cnot credible\u201d. On Wednesday, Omar noted that Abrams had once described US policy in El Salvador as a \u201cfabulous achievement\u201d. \u201cFrom the day that President Duarte was elected in a free election, to this day, El Salvador has been a democracy,\u201d he responded. \u201cThat\u2019s a fabulous achievement.\u201d The CIA poured nearly $1m into President Jos\u00e9 Napole\u00f3n Duarte\u2019s 1984 presidential campaign as part of an effort to block a victory for the far-right military strongman Roberto d\u2019Aubuisson. The Reagan administration hailed Duarte as a centrist reformer who would bring democracy to El Salvador. With Duarte in power, the US increased military aid to El Salvador, hitting a high of $197m in 1984. But Washington turned a blind eye to the human rights abuses carried out by the military and allied death squads under Duarte\u2019s watch. For many, justice for El Mozote means seeing state agents pay for their crimes. \u201cThere are indications that high ranking military officers were the ones who planned, executed, and developed [the military operation],\u201d Wilfredo Medrano, a co-prosecutor representing the victims, told the Guardian. Medrano added the US had a \u201cmoral and economic responsibility\u201d to support El Salvador\u2019s search for truth and justice given its historic role backing state abuses. \u201cSomething very important is that [the victims] can find out why, how, and where their family members were killed,\u201d Judge Jorge Guzman, overseeing the case, told the Guardian. \u201cThey have a right to reparations for the harm they suffered, both material and psychological.\u201d",

The union is seeking to quash the Roc\u2019s investigation, citing the decision by members of Cash\u2019s staff to leak news of the impeding raids to argue the investigation was politically motivated. Earlier on Friday, the small business minister told the court in Melbourne that her interest in the donations was driven by her duty to investigate possible breaches of union rules. Under repeated questioning, she did concede that the Labor leader\u2019s position as AWU boss at the time of the donations was \u201cprobably\u201d of political interest to her. \u201cI am politician, by nature I am political,\u201d she said. Later, Cash was asked about her conversation with her former media adviser, David De Garis, during the dinner break at Senate estimates on 25 October 2017. On that night she was forced to concede De Garis had tipped off the media about the raids. Christopher Horan, Cash\u2019s lawyer, successfully cited parliamentary privilege to argue she should not be forced to give specific evidence about the details of the conversation. Cash had said in Senate estimates she had been told De Garis learned about the raids from \u201ca media source\u201d. He told the court Cash\u2019s former chief of staff had tipped him off about the search warrants. \u201cA running commentary is being given in question time,\u201d Horan told the court. Cash declined to correct her evidence in the Senate on Thursday, saying she would be appearing in court. Cash also told the court she had provided a statement to the Australian Federal Police when it investigated the media leak. She was not interviewed, the court heard. The police later decided they would not lay charges. The court had heard on Thursday that Cash\u2019s chief of staff, Ben Davies, told police he had learned of the raids from Mark Lee, a media adviser at the Roc. Cash told the court on Friday that Lee had informed her office two days after the raids that he no longer wanted to accept an offer to join her office. Outside court on Friday morning, the AWU\u2019s national secretary, Daniel Walton, said: \u201cThe challenge for minister Cash today is: is she going to hide behind all the technical legal arguments or is she going to \u2026 properly answer all the questions as to what she knew?\u201d The trial continues.",

      "body": "<p>On the first day of this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jaipur-literature-festival\" title=\"\">Jaipur literary festival</a>, the American novelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/30/thriller-reviews-woman-in-the-window-child-finder-the-feed\" title=\"\">AJ Finn</a>, real name Dan Mallory, was interviewed on stage. He talked about enjoying the success of <em>The Woman in the Window</em>, the thriller he wrote in one year, in one draft, which made him a multimillionaire. He talked about his diagnosis with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/apr/14/bipolar-disorder-facts-symptoms\" title=\"\"> bipolar II disorder</a>, and the parallel between women\u2019s struggle to be taken seriously and that experienced by people with mental health problems. He also mentioned some of the drawbacks of success. \u201cI am dealing with a particularly unpleasant journalist in the US,\u201d he told news18.com after the event. \u201cThis particular journalist, and there have been a few others, hears that I or someone else has a mental health issue, and is like: \u2018Oh! I am going to find out what is wrong with you, and rummage through your past and see what you did.\u2019 It\u2019s a little concerning, especially because you don\u2019t remember what you did when you weren\u2019t acting like yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Six days later, on 30 January, Mallory was able to recall lying to his friends and colleagues for many years about having cancer. \u201cI felt intensely ashamed of my psychological struggles,\u201d he explained in a statement sent to the New Yorker. \u201cI was utterly terrified of what people would think of me if they knew.\u201d Five days later the New Yorker published a profile of Mallory, which alleged or implied that he had also lied, among other things, about having a doctorate from Oxford; his mother dying; his brother taking his own life; and about discovering JK Rowling as a crime writer.</p> <p>Fiction writers are professional fantasists, so perhaps you\u2019d expect to find a few who can\u2019t restrict their fantasies to the page. In fact, there are so many that it is tempting to wonder whether literary imposture ought to have a syndrome of its own. If so, Mallory, although his lies don\u2019t amount to a crime, belongs in a distinct subtype alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jul/19/archer.politics2\" title=\"\">Jeffrey Archer</a>, who went to prison for perjury and has lied about many minor things. These writers are ambitious and often charming commercial novelists whose gift for storytelling sometimes looks like a skill they have harnessed, sometimes like a compulsion that they can\u2019t control. Perhaps you\u2019d include the crime writers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/12/stephen-leather-cyberbullying-steve-mosby-jeremy-duns\" title=\"\">Stephen Leather</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/03/rj-ellory-secret-amazon-reviews\" title=\"\">RJ Ellory </a>who used online aliases to trash their rivals\u2019 books and praise their own. Generally, their lies do little harm to their careers, because the truth of an author\u2019s life means little to a reader in search of entertainment. Mallory argues that a writer\u2019s life is irrelevant in any case. \u201cI am not especially interested in author\u2019s bios,\u201d he told the Observer last year. \u201cI am buying their novel, not their memoir. I view it as a sign of respect to not want to know too much.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfe12684e0ee9dc2ef2827b33d098a991856ce41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfe12684e0ee9dc2ef2827b33d098a991856ce41/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Courtney Love, Astor, JT Leroy, and Speedy in 2003.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Courtney Love, Astor, JT Leroy (later revealed to be Laura Albert), and Speedy in 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Peyton/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In practice, complete ignorance of the author is impossible. A name alone carries information, even if it is coded in assumptions. Take<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/24/fiction.berylbainbridge\" title=\"\"> Rahila Khan</a>, whose stories about British Asian teenagers were broadcast on the BBC, leading to a book called <em>Down the Road, Worlds Away</em> being published by Virago in 1987. Khan was in fact a man teaching RE in a girls\u2019 boarding school. Her real name was the Rev Toby Forward.</p> <p>Forward had wanted modern writing with a Muslim background to use in his lessons, but found little, so he wrote his own. He wondered if Radio 4 might be interested, but was terrified of rejection so he sent a story under a nom de plume. \u201cIt felt like a barrier,\u201d he now says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want them to write back to \u2018Toby Forward\u2019 saying, \u2018Your stuff is shit\u2019\u2026 I chose a name that was appropriate to the material. That was all.\u201d</p> <p>When the BBC wanted another story, they wrote to Khan, and Khan wrote back. The BBC didn\u2019t like it when she wrote about white boys, so she returned to Asian girls. Forward borrowed his great-grandfather\u2019s name \u201cTom Dale\u201d for the next white boy stories, which he wrote on a different typewriter, with the postal address of his assistant. The Dale stories were also broadcast, and Forward started to enjoy himself. \u201cI wanted to have a whole week of Radio 4 morning stories, all by me under different names,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I had women leaving messages on the answerphone, saying: \u2018We\u2019re going to take your balls off'</p> <footer> <cite>Toby Forward</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Still, Khan was the star. Listeners loved her work. Khan was encouraged to publish. The only imprints taking this type of short story were the Women\u2019s Press and Virago. Forward hoped that Virago would back out when he refused to meet them. When they didn\u2019t, Khan signed a contract. She was supposed to promote the book, give a radio talk, write an article for the Guardian. There is no good time to admit you\u2019ve been deceiving people, but later is worse. Forward confessed to his agent, who told Virago, who removed the books from sale and pulped them, furious. Forward had a very bad time. \u201cI had women leaving messages on the answerphone,\u201d he says, \u201csaying: \u2018We\u2019re going to take your balls off. We\u2019re going to kill you.\u2019\u201d At one stage he was using another pseudonym, a Yorkshireman named Francis Wagstaff, just to answer the phone. If the caller seemed polite, Wagstaff would fetch the reverend.</p> <p>Critics said that Forward had stolen an opportunity from a real Asian woman. He insists this never occurred to him, nor would it, because he doesn\u2019t see fiction that way. He was writing about being an outsider, a feeling he knew well from his own poor background. The alter egos, as he wrote at the time, \u201creleased me from the obligation of being what I seem to be so that I can write as I really am\u201d. When it comes to an author\u2019s life, he agrees with Mallory: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t matter to the reader who this person is.\u201d</p> <p>Yet sometimes it matters a great deal. A novel about the Holocaust such as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/13/featuresreviews.guardianreview12\" title=\"\">The Painted Bird</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/13/featuresreviews.guardianreview12\" title=\"\"> </a>(1965) feels different if you know that it was written by a survivor \u2013 Jerzy Kosinski. A novel that makes Germany confront its Nazi past such as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/08/tin-drum-gunter-grass-review\" title=\"\">The Tin Drum</a></em> (1959) takes on a new resonance if it comes from a man of principle who was there, such as G\u00fcnter Grass. It matters that Kosinski secretly used the experiences of others, and that Grass was hiding his own past membership of the Waffen-SS. The same goes for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/15/romain-gary-david-bellos-review\" title=\"\">JT LeRoy, who was not a male sex worker writing about male sex work, but the invention of a woman called Laura Albert, and for \u00c9mile Ajar</a>, the Algerian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who won the Prix Goncourt for <em>The Life Before Us</em>, about a Muslim boy, but was in fact already well known as French novelist Romain Gary, also a Goncourt winner.</p> <p>Most commonly, novelists pretend that they\u2019re not novelists at all. Indeed those were the novel\u2019s origins, in fake memoirs such as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/06/100-novels-swift-gullivers-travels-mccrum\" title=\"\">Gulliver\u2019s Travels</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/30/100-best-books-robinson-crusoe\" title=\"\">Robinson Crusoe</a></em>. While researching this article, I counted 21 successful memoirists whose books were exposed as substantially false or exaggerated in the past 30 years. (This does not include forgers or plagiarists, or writers of dishonest journalism, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/03/jonah-lehrer-trouble-with-facts\" title=\"\">Jonah Lehrer </a>or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jan/02/johann-hari-interview-drugs-book-independent\" title=\"\">Johann Hari</a>.) There\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/15/usa.world\" title=\"\">James Frey</a>\u2019s addiction memoir <em>A Million Little Pieces</em>, which was published in 2003 and exposed in 2006. (Another very famous addiction memoir, 1971\u2019s <em>Go Ask Alice</em>, had been exposed in 1979.) Michelle Smith released a memoir of satanic abuse called <em>Michelle Remembers</em> in 1980. It began a moral panic, and was joined by Lauren Stratford\u2019s <em>Satan\u2019s Underground</em> in 1988, but both books were revealed to be full of inconsistencies. In 2014, Newsweek revealed that <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/30/sex-trafficking-activist-somaly-mam-quits\" title=\"\">The Road of Lost Innocence</a></em> (2005), Somaly Mam\u2019s memoir of being sex trafficked, contained false information.</p> <p>Holocaust survival is a sadly common fantasy. Untrue or exaggerated Holocaust memoirs have been written by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/oct/15/features11.g24\" title=\"\">Binjamin Wilkomirski</a> (in the 1990s), by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/12/author-fake-holocaust-memoir-to-return-22m\" title=\"\">Misha Defonseca</a>, who included the claim that she was raised by wolves, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/19/holocaust-memoirist-herman-rosenblat\" title=\"\">Herman Rosenblat </a>(exposed before publication in 2008), and by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/12/secondworldwar.spain\" title=\"\">Enric Marco</a> (2005). When Oprah Winfrey famously reprimanded Frey in 2006, she had already interviewed Smith and Stratford on her show.

Some look back with deep remorse. Tim Barrus, who pretended to be a Navajo writer called Nasdijj, will only talk to me by email. \u201cI am reluctant to go anywhere near the whole Nasdijj thing because it brought so many people so much pain,\u201d he says. \u201cI am deeply sorry, and I regret doing it \u2026 It was a nightmare I am trying to put behind me.\u201d</p> <p>If we want to know why people keep doing this, we should ask why we keep believing them.

      "bodyText": "On the first day of this year\u2019s Jaipur literary festival, the American novelist AJ Finn, real name Dan Mallory, was interviewed on stage. He talked about enjoying the success of The Woman in the Window, the thriller he wrote in one year, in one draft, which made him a multimillionaire. He talked about his diagnosis with bipolar II disorder, and the parallel between women\u2019s struggle to be taken seriously and that experienced by people with mental health problems. He also mentioned some of the drawbacks of success. \u201cI am dealing with a particularly unpleasant journalist in the US,\u201d he told news18.com after the event. \u201cThis particular journalist, and there have been a few others, hears that I or someone else has a mental health issue, and is like: \u2018Oh! I am going to find out what is wrong with you, and rummage through your past and see what you did.\u2019 It\u2019s a little concerning, especially because you don\u2019t remember what you did when you weren\u2019t acting like yourself.\u201d Six days later, on 30 January, Mallory was able to recall lying to his friends and colleagues for many years about having cancer. \u201cI felt intensely ashamed of my psychological struggles,\u201d he explained in a statement sent to the New Yorker. \u201cI was utterly terrified of what people would think of me if they knew.\u201d Five days later the New Yorker published a profile of Mallory, which alleged or implied that he had also lied, among other things, about having a doctorate from Oxford; his mother dying; his brother taking his own life; and about discovering JK Rowling as a crime writer. Fiction writers are professional fantasists, so perhaps you\u2019d expect to find a few who can\u2019t restrict their fantasies to the page. In fact, there are so many that it is tempting to wonder whether literary imposture ought to have a syndrome of its own. If so, Mallory, although his lies don\u2019t amount to a crime, belongs in a distinct subtype alongside Jeffrey Archer, who went to prison for perjury and has lied about many minor things. These writers are ambitious and often charming commercial novelists whose gift for storytelling sometimes looks like a skill they have harnessed, sometimes like a compulsion that they can\u2019t control. Perhaps you\u2019d include the crime writers Stephen Leather and RJ Ellory who used online aliases to trash their rivals\u2019 books and praise their own. Generally, their lies do little harm to their careers, because the truth of an author\u2019s life means little to a reader in search of entertainment. Mallory argues that a writer\u2019s life is irrelevant in any case. \u201cI am not especially interested in author\u2019s bios,\u201d he told the Observer last year. \u201cI am buying their novel, not their memoir. I view it as a sign of respect to not want to know too much.\u201d In practice, complete ignorance of the author is impossible. A name alone carries information, even if it is coded in assumptions. Take Rahila Khan, whose stories about British Asian teenagers were broadcast on the BBC, leading to a book called Down the Road, Worlds Away being published by Virago in 1987. Khan was in fact a man teaching RE in a girls\u2019 boarding school. Her real name was the Rev Toby Forward. Forward had wanted modern writing with a Muslim background to use in his lessons, but found little, so he wrote his own. He wondered if Radio 4 might be interested, but was terrified of rejection so he sent a story under a nom de plume. \u201cIt felt like a barrier,\u201d he now says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want them to write back to \u2018Toby Forward\u2019 saying, \u2018Your stuff is shit\u2019\u2026 I chose a name that was appropriate to the material. That was all.\u201d When the BBC wanted another story, they wrote to Khan, and Khan wrote back. The BBC didn\u2019t like it when she wrote about white boys, so she returned to Asian girls. Forward borrowed his great-grandfather\u2019s name \u201cTom Dale\u201d for the next white boy stories, which he wrote on a different typewriter, with the postal address of his assistant. The Dale stories were also broadcast, and Forward started to enjoy himself. \u201cI wanted to have a whole week of Radio 4 morning stories, all by me under different names,\u201d he says. Still, Khan was the star. Listeners loved her work. Khan was encouraged to publish. The only imprints taking this type of short story were the Women\u2019s Press and Virago. Forward hoped that Virago would back out when he refused to meet them. When they didn\u2019t, Khan signed a contract. She was supposed to promote the book, give a radio talk, write an article for the Guardian. There is no good time to admit you\u2019ve been deceiving people, but later is worse. Forward confessed to his agent, who told Virago, who removed the books from sale and pulped them, furious. Forward had a very bad time. \u201cI had women leaving messages on the answerphone,\u201d he says, \u201csaying: \u2018We\u2019re going to take your balls off. We\u2019re going to kill you.\u2019\u201d At one stage he was using another pseudonym, a Yorkshireman named Francis Wagstaff, just to answer the phone. If the caller seemed polite, Wagstaff would fetch the reverend. Critics said that Forward had stolen an opportunity from a real Asian woman. He insists this never occurred to him, nor would it, because he doesn\u2019t see fiction that way. He was writing about being an outsider, a feeling he knew well from his own poor background. The alter egos, as he wrote at the time, \u201creleased me from the obligation of being what I seem to be so that I can write as I really am\u201d. When it comes to an author\u2019s life, he agrees with Mallory: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t matter to the reader who this person is.\u201d Yet sometimes it matters a great deal. A novel about the Holocaust such as The Painted Bird (1965) feels different if you know that it was written by a survivor \u2013 Jerzy Kosinski. A novel that makes Germany confront its Nazi past such as The Tin Drum (1959) takes on a new resonance if it comes from a man of principle who was there, such as G\u00fcnter Grass. It matters that Kosinski secretly used the experiences of others, and that Grass was hiding his own past membership of the Waffen-SS. The same goes for JT LeRoy, who was not a male sex worker writing about male sex work, but the invention of a woman called Laura Albert, and for \u00c9mile Ajar, the Algerian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who won the Prix Goncourt for The Life Before Us, about a Muslim boy, but was in fact already well known as French novelist Romain Gary, also a Goncourt winner. Most commonly, novelists pretend that they\u2019re not novelists at all. Indeed those were the novel\u2019s origins, in fake memoirs such as Gulliver\u2019s Travels and Robinson Crusoe. While researching this article, I counted 21 successful memoirists whose books were exposed as substantially false or exaggerated in the past 30 years. (This does not include forgers or plagiarists, or writers of dishonest journalism, such as Jonah Lehrer or Johann Hari.) There\u2019s James Frey\u2019s addiction memoir A Million Little Pieces, which was published in 2003 and exposed in 2006. (Another very famous addiction memoir, 1971\u2019s Go Ask Alice, had been exposed in 1979.) Michelle Smith released a memoir of satanic abuse called Michelle Remembers in 1980. It began a moral panic, and was joined by Lauren Stratford\u2019s Satan\u2019s Underground in 1988, but both books were revealed to be full of inconsistencies. In 2014, Newsweek revealed that The Road of Lost Innocence (2005), Somaly Mam\u2019s memoir of being sex trafficked, contained false information. Holocaust survival is a sadly common fantasy. Untrue or exaggerated Holocaust memoirs have been written by Binjamin Wilkomirski (in the 1990s), by Misha Defonseca, who included the claim that she was raised by wolves, by Herman Rosenblat (exposed before publication in 2008), and by Enric Marco (2005).

      "body": "<h2>Top story: Legal battle looms over \u2018desperate\u2019 measure</h2> <p>Good morning, it\u2019s Warren Murray getting you off to a running start.</p> <p>Donald Trump is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/14/trump-declare-national-emergency-border-wall-mitch-mcconnell\">moving to declare a national emergency</a> in an attempt to build his wall on the border with Mexico. Democrats are drawing constitutional battle lines over what they have called a \u201cdesperate\u201d abuse of presidential powers.</p> <p>Overnight the US Congress passed a spending bill to avert another government shutdown \u2013 it includes $1.375bn for 55 miles of new border fencing, far less than the $5.7bn Trump sought for a concrete or steel wall. The bill will go before Trump today. \u201cPresident Trump will sign the government funding bill,\u201d said a White House statement, \u201cand as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action \u2013 including a national emergency.\u201d That could involve trying to mobilise the military to build the wall.</p> <p>Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House, has said she will consider a legal challenge to the emergency declaration, and there are questions over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/14/trump-national-emergency-explainer-border-wall\">whether, and how, it could ultimately be used to build the wall</a>.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>\u2018They don\u2019t compromise, they never have\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Theresa May has been defeated in the Commons by hardline Brexiters of the European Research Group (ERG), who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/14/conservatives-react-angrily-to-defeat-of-mays-brexit-plan\">refused to vote to endorse her EU negotiating strategy</a>. Remain-minded Tories were furious after the vote and said the PM should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/14/conservatives-react-angrily-to-defeat-of-mays-brexit-plan\">sideline the ERG by seeking agreement across the House</a> rather than trying to please Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s grouping. A cabinet source said: \u201cOnce again the ERG have made life hell for the prime minister and put their own fantasies in the way of pragmatic politics.\u201d The ERG sided against May because, it said, she was trying to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. The rebellion marks the end of a temporary truce over Brexit among Conservative MPs, who had voted last month to endorse May\u2019s strategy to try and obtain concessions on the Irish border backstop.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>\u2018Beginning of great changes\u2019 \u2013 </strong>The school climate strike comes to the UK today.

If you are taking part today, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/12/school-climate-strikes-share-your-videos-and-stories\">let us know about it with your videos, photos and stories</a>.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Novichok third man theory \u2013 </strong>Another possible suspect in the death of Dawn Sturgess and the poisonings of Sergei Skripal, Yulia Skripal and Charlie Rowley has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/14/salisbury-poisoning-website-says-it-has-identified-third-gru-suspect\">identified by online investigators as a Russian military intelligence officer</a>. Bellingcat says Denis Sergeyev is the real identity of a man operating under the name of Sergey Fedotov. He was in Bulgaria when another suspected poisoning took place. British authorities have not identified a third suspect, and the Bellingcat report acknowledged that \u201cit is unclear what [Sergeyev\u2019s] role may have been, if any, in the preparation and execution of the poisoning operation\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Condoms in schools \u2013 </strong>Giving out condoms to students reduces sexually transmitted infections (STIs) but does not lead to the young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/15/giving-teenagers-condoms-does-not-lead-to-promiscuity-or-cut-pregnancy-rates-un-study\">having sex earlier, more often, or becoming pregnant</a>, a major UN study has found. Researchers concluded that once condom programmes were in place in schools, students used them, and such schemes could be especially beneficial in countries with a higher risk of HIV. Comprehensive sex education programmes should be introduced alongside giving out condoms, said Bidia Deperthes from the UN Population Fund. \u201cPutting them in a corner and expecting it to do the job, is not going to happen.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Man v mountain lion \u2013 </strong>A Colorado jogger has told how he wrestled a mountain lion that attacked him and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/14/colorado-jogger-recounts-ordeal-with-mountain-lion\">jammed his foot on its throat until it choked to death</a>. \u201cIt finally stopped moving and then the jaws opened and I was able to kind of scramble back up the hill and get the heck out of Dodge,\u201d said Travis Kauffman of the 4 February ordeal. When the animal pounced, it locked its teeth on to his wrist and they tumbled off the side of the trail. Kauffman grabbed a rock with his free hand and beat the cat on the back of the head. He also tried stabbing it with a twig, but it held on until \u201cI was able to kind of shift my weight and get a foot on its neck\u201d. \u201cTravis is a pretty amazing young man,\u201d said Ty Petersburg, from Colorado Parks and Wildlife.</p> <h2>Today in Focus podcast: Did air pollution kill Ella?</h2> <p>This Friday marks six years since nine-year-old Ella-Kissi Deborah died.

At the turn of the 20th century, when many were acquired (Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Guam, American Samoa, Hawaii, Wake), their status was clear. They were, as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson unabashedly called them, colonies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f61e45ae68b368a85b96d37151b287c76b83b8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f61e45ae68b368a85b96d37151b287c76b83b8f/773_625_8622_5174/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Map showing the continental United States as well as its territories\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A true map of the United States and its territories would look more like this.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Guardian Design</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That forthright imperialism didn\u2019t last. Within a decade or two, the c-word became taboo. \u201cThe word colony must not be used to express the relationship which exists between our government and its dependent peoples,\u201d an official admonished in 1914. Better to stick with a gentler term, used for them all: territories. Today\u2019s typical mental map is a union of states bounded by the Atlantic, the Pacific, Mexico and Canada \u2013 possibly with the addition of Alaska and Hawaii. But, writes Daniel Immerwahr, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/feb/15/the-us-hidden-empire-overseas-territories-united-states-guam-puerto-rico-american-samoa\">shape does not match the country\u2019s legal borders</a>, and leaves territorial American nationals relegated to the shadows.</p> <h2>Sport</h2> <p>Goals from Ross Barkley and Olivier Giroud <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/14/malmo-chelsea-europa-league-match-report\">gave Chelsea a 2-1 win at Malm\u00f6</a> in their Europa League last-32 tie as European competition offered Maurizio Sarri some respite. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/14/bate-borisov-arsenal-europa-league-match-report\">Arsenal lost 1-0 at Bate Borisov</a>, with Alexandre Lacazette having an equaliser ruled out then being sent off for a retaliatory elbow while on a bruising night in Glasgow for Brendan Rodgers and Celtic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/14/celtic-valencia-europa-league-match-report\">Valencia cantered towards a 2-0 victor</a>y which should render next week at the Mestalla a formality.</p> <p>Wales are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/14/eddie-jones-hand-grenades-wales-neil-jenkins-england-six-nations\">ready for a war of words</a> in the buildup to their match against England in Cardiff a week on Saturday, with Eddie Jones making an early start on Sunday by declaring he does not see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/10/eddie-jones-eager-england-show-wales-improvement\" title=\"\">the Principality Stadium as a fortress</a>.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Legal battle looms over \u2018desperate\u2019 measure Good morning, it\u2019s Warren Murray getting you off to a running start. Donald Trump is moving to declare a national emergency in an attempt to build his wall on the border with Mexico. Democrats are drawing constitutional battle lines over what they have called a \u201cdesperate\u201d abuse of presidential powers. Overnight the US Congress passed a spending bill to avert another government shutdown \u2013 it includes $1.375bn for 55 miles of new border fencing, far less than the $5.7bn Trump sought for a concrete or steel wall. The bill will go before Trump today. \u201cPresident Trump will sign the government funding bill,\u201d said a White House statement, \u201cand as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action \u2013 including a national emergency.\u201d That could involve trying to mobilise the military to build the wall. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House, has said she will consider a legal challenge to the emergency declaration, and there are questions over whether, and how, it could ultimately be used to build the wall. * * * \u2018They don\u2019t compromise, they never have\u2019 \u2013 Theresa May has been defeated in the Commons by hardline Brexiters of the European Research Group (ERG), who refused to vote to endorse her EU negotiating strategy. Remain-minded Tories were furious after the vote and said the PM should sideline the ERG by seeking agreement across the House rather than trying to please Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s grouping. A cabinet source said: \u201cOnce again the ERG have made life hell for the prime minister and put their own fantasies in the way of pragmatic politics.\u201d The ERG sided against May because, it said, she was trying to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. The rebellion marks the end of a temporary truce over Brexit among Conservative MPs, who had voted last month to endorse May\u2019s strategy to try and obtain concessions on the Irish border backstop. * * * \u2018Beginning of great changes\u2019 \u2013 The school climate strike comes to the UK today. Greta Thunberg started the YouthStrike4Climate movement last summer as a lone demonstrator outside the Swedish parliament. \u201cWe are in the middle of the biggest crisis in human history and basically nothing is being done to prevent it,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cI think what we are seeing is the beginning of great changes and that is very hopeful.\u201d Thunberg has risen rapidly in prominence and influence \u2013 berating world leaders at the United Nations climate conference, and taking her message to the global business elite at Davos. If you are taking part today, let us know about it with your videos, photos and stories. * * * Novichok third man theory \u2013 Another possible suspect in the death of Dawn Sturgess and the poisonings of Sergei Skripal, Yulia Skripal and Charlie Rowley has been identified by online investigators as a Russian military intelligence officer. Bellingcat says Denis Sergeyev is the real identity of a man operating under the name of Sergey Fedotov. He was in Bulgaria when another suspected poisoning took place. British authorities have not identified a third suspect, and the Bellingcat report acknowledged that \u201cit is unclear what [Sergeyev\u2019s] role may have been, if any, in the preparation and execution of the poisoning operation\u201d. * * * Condoms in schools \u2013 Giving out condoms to students reduces sexually transmitted infections (STIs) but does not lead to the young having sex earlier, more often, or becoming pregnant, a major UN study has found. Researchers concluded that once condom programmes were in place in schools, students used them, and such schemes could be especially beneficial in countries with a higher risk of HIV. Comprehensive sex education programmes should be introduced alongside giving out condoms, said Bidia Deperthes from the UN Population Fund. \u201cPutting them in a corner and expecting it to do the job, is not going to happen.\u201d * * * Man v mountain lion \u2013 A Colorado jogger has told how he wrestled a mountain lion that attacked him and jammed his foot on its throat until it choked to death. \u201cIt finally stopped moving and then the jaws opened and I was able to kind of scramble back up the hill and get the heck out of Dodge,\u201d said Travis Kauffman of the 4 February ordeal. When the animal pounced, it locked its teeth on to his wrist and they tumbled off the side of the trail. Kauffman grabbed a rock with his free hand and beat the cat on the back of the head. He also tried stabbing it with a twig, but it held on until \u201cI was able to kind of shift my weight and get a foot on its neck\u201d. \u201cTravis is a pretty amazing young man,\u201d said Ty Petersburg, from Colorado Parks and Wildlife. Today in Focus podcast: Did air pollution kill Ella? This Friday marks six years since nine-year-old Ella-Kissi Deborah died. Her mother believes London\u2019s air pollution is responsible for her death. Plus: 15-year old George Bond explains why he is going on today\u2019s school climate strike. Lunchtime read: America\u2019s hidden empire The United States likes to think of itself as a republic, but the truth is, it holds territories all over the world. At the turn of the 20th century, when many were acquired (Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Guam, American Samoa, Hawaii, Wake), their status was clear. They were, as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson unabashedly called them, colonies. That forthright imperialism didn\u2019t last. Within a decade or two, the c-word became taboo. \u201cThe word colony must not be used to express the relationship which exists between our government and its dependent peoples,\u201d an official admonished in 1914. Better to stick with a gentler term, used for them all: territories. Today\u2019s typical mental map is a union of states bounded by the Atlantic, the Pacific, Mexico and Canada \u2013 possibly with the addition of Alaska and Hawaii. But, writes Daniel Immerwahr, that shape does not match the country\u2019s legal borders, and leaves territorial American nationals relegated to the shadows. Sport Goals from Ross Barkley and Olivier Giroud gave Chelsea a 2-1 win at Malm\u00f6 in their Europa League last-32 tie as European competition offered Maurizio Sarri some respite. Arsenal lost 1-0 at Bate Borisov, with Alexandre Lacazette having an equaliser ruled out then being sent off for a retaliatory elbow while on a bruising night in Glasgow for Brendan Rodgers and Celtic, Valencia cantered towards a 2-0 victory which should render next week at the Mestalla a formality. Wales are ready for a war of words in the buildup to their match against England in Cardiff a week on Saturday, with Eddie Jones making an early start on Sunday by declaring he does not see the Principality Stadium as a fortress. Shannon Gabriel, the West Indies fast bowler, has offered an unreserved apology to Joe Root and claimed the on-field comment to the England captain that triggered his four-match ban was: \u201cDo you like boys?\u201d Caster Semenya\u2019s lawyers have said the 800m Olympic champion is \u201cunquestionably a woman\u201d who will be fighting for her right to compete internationally without \u201cunnecessary medical intervention\u201d when she appears at the court of arbitration for sport. And US golfer Matt Kuchar has defended his decision to pay his caddie $5,000 following a victory that earned him $1.3m in the Mayakoba Golf Classic. Business Asian stocks were subdued by surprisingly weak US retail sales figures on Thursday showing their biggest fall for nearly 10 years. News that Donald Trump wants to declare a national emergency didn\u2019t help market nerves. The FTSE100 is expected to open slightly down while the pound is still floating around in the doldrums at $1.279 and \u20ac1.134. The papers The front page of the Times features a follow-up to their story of yesterday on the Bethnal Green schoolgirl: \u201cFamily of Isis bride make plea for mercy\u201d.

The Mail has: \u201c\u2018Dozens\u2019 of jihadi brides want to get home\u201d and the i reports: \u201cIsis child bride faces UK arrest\u201d.

      "bodyText": "An app produced by the Chinese government has become the most popular in the country, rocketing up through the charts with a little help from the Chinese Communist Party. The app\u2019s name \u201cStudy (Xi) Strong Country\u201d, is a pun \u2013 Xuexi being the word for \u201cstudy\u201d but also containing the president\u2019s name, suggesting users are to \u201cstudy Xi\u201d. The little red app is all-encompassing, allowing users to see state media news reports, video chat with their friends, make a personal schedule and send \u201cred envelopes\u201d of money to friends. The app comes with a Snapchat-like messaging function where messages disappear after being read. But perhaps among its most important functions is that it can help users brush up on Xi Jinping\u2019s thought. They can also take weekly quizzes \u2013 including questions about Xi \u2013 to earn points and ultimately prizes or watch television series about China\u2019s \u201cgreat revolutionary history\u201d. The app also features sections for various provinces in China where users can see news reports of Xi\u2019s recent visits. A video shot in Hubei shows students, workers, retirees, police, and soldiers shouting \u201cOnly by studying (Xi) can we make China strong!\u201d This week the app overtook WeChat and TikTok to become the most-downloaded app for Apple and ios devices in China, though its popularity is not entirely due to merit. Government directives have been issued telling members of the Chinese Communist Party to download the app. This week, Henan province, officials instructed party members to \u201cmove quickly and effectively\u201d in promoting the app and announced a plan to deploy a team of \u201ccorrespondents\u201d and commentators to provide material for the app. A university in Zhejiang called on all party groups to use the app in order to form a \u201cstronghold\u201d for Xi Jinping thought. Government officials in Fujian province and Qingdao city held workshops last month stressing the \u201cpolitical importance\u201d of the app, and directing local leaders to promote the app across government departments. Some users have reported feeling stressed about earning enough points on the platform, saying their employers are requiring them to score a certain number of points. One user wrote on Weibo: \u201cIf you have a low score you will be shamed. Now everyone is crazily trying to get more points \u2013 how can we learn anything?\u201d Others complained their rankings were being posted everyday. \u201cI\u2019m screwed\u201d, one said. Others hinted they were forced to download the app. One commentator posted an emoji of a dog looking slyly to the side, an image often used by Chinese internet users to indicate sarcasm, writing: \u201cI voluntarily installed the Study Xi Strong Country app.\u201d This is not the first Xi app released in China\u2019s battle for the country\u2019s hearts and minds. Last May, the Beijing News reported that the party launched a free app called \u201cLearn from Xi\u201d, which contained Xi\u2019s first book, a collection of his quotes and speeches, even showing a map of the country, so users could know where he had made each statement. The app also featured expert commentary and academic papers analysing his views. The app comes after a year in which China stepped up its censorship of online platforms. Censors routinely shut down content deemed dangerous for social stability, including Peppa Pig videos, pictures of Winnie the Pooh and the letter \u201cn\u201d. Authorities have been forcing activists on Twitter to delete their accounts and WeChat groups are regularly shut down, even ones devoted to apolitical content.

In the case of 16Arlington, that prospect is figurative and literal, given the brand\u2019s signature is statement sequins. \u201cIt is a real fusion of our styles,\u201d says Marco Capaldo, who launched the label with his partner Federica \u201cKikka\u201d Cavenati out of their north London flat last year. (It\u2019s named for the address of their first shared studio.) \u201cI love a bit of excessive glamour, and Kikka has a soft spot for very clean, minimal tailoring.\u201d The couple met in London while studying at the Istituto Marangoni and they share Italian heritage \u2013 a duality reflected in their stimuli for SS19. \u201cWe drew inspiration from an imaginary dinner between Gina Lollobrigida and Joan Collins,\u201d says Cavenati, explaining that it was the legendary Italian and English actresses who informed the collection\u2019s juxtaposition of 50s glamour and 80s power shoulders. The sparkle that shimmered in both epochs is the connecting thread. \u201cWe love creating clothes that women want to wear, that give them confidence to transform into the best version of themselves,\u201d Capaldo says. \u201cWhen someone tells us they had the best time wearing a 16Arlington piece, it\u2019s magic.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Talking Points Major podcast players Spotify and the BBC are teaming up for a new series. Created by the BBC Studios arm of the corporation, Stay Free: The Story of the Clash will follow \u2018the rise, the reign and the self-destruction\u2019 of Joe Strummer\u2019s punk icons, according to Deadline. The eight-part series is narrated by Public Enemy rapper Chuck D and launches on Spotify on 28 February. One of this newsletter\u2019s favourite podcasts is getting the prestige TV treatment. Slate series Slow Burn, which looks at major American political events such as the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal in granular detail, will be adapted into a six-part docuseries by US network Epix. Meanwhile the show\u2019s erstwhile host Leon Neyfakh will launch a new podcast, Fiasco, later this year, with its first two series looking at the 2000 Bush/Gore election fight and the Iran Contra affair. Picks of the week The Ron Burgundy Podcast Will Ferrell brings Anchorman Ron Burgundy to the world of podcasting and everything\u2019s exactly as it should be. He blunders through links and interviews, guffawing at his own jokes and pronouncing meme as \u201cmemm-eh\u201d. His first subject is true crime, a genre he describes as \u201cwhite hot, like molten lava\u201d as if he\u2019s the only person to have discovered it. Asking a forensic expert questions such as \u201cIf a woman dumps you, can you have her arrested?\u201d, this is Burgundy on ramblingly good form. Hannah Verdier The Dropout As the golden age of the scam continues (see also: Fyre festival and the exposing of author Dan Mallory as a serial liar), get your fraud fix with this podcast on Stanford dropout-turned-CEO Elizabeth Holmes, who charmed the worlds of finance and science with a revolutionary blood-testing device, but whose company Theranos \u2013 once valued in the billions \u2013 was shut down last year after false claims about the technology\u2019s effectiveness. This six-parter builds a picture of a business as dangerous as it was chaotic. Hannah J Davies Guardian pick: Audio Long Read This week\u2019s Audio Long Read centres on the \u201cMoney Saving Expert\u201d Martin Lewis, a man who has built a multimillion pound empire, and is driven to help people attain \u2018financial justice\u2019. The piece, originally written by Daniel Cohen (and read by Alice Arnold), asks; in an age of predatory capitalism and rampant inequality, can one man\u2019s modest suggestions really make much a difference? Producer pick: Queer Longing \u2013 A Pinch of Straight Salt: A Valentine\u2019s Day Special (Episode 4) Chosen by Leah Green (video producer) It\u2019s a great feeling to be able to say you were a fan of something \u2018from the beginning\u2019. And with the launch of Queer Longing, you have that chance. This podcast is only four episodes old, but it has the potential to become a weekly essential. Olivia Taylor and Lucy Cecil are two gay friends based in Manchester, and their podcast looks at what they are \u201clonging for and living for\u201d in their queer world. In practice, this means fan-girling over Gillian Anderson, getting giddy for the return of the L Word, and discussing having to come out repeatedly if you are not \u2018obviously\u2019 gay. Don\u2019t turn off before the end because you\u2019ll miss the #CelineWatch segment, where they talk about \u2026 what Celine Dion has been up to that week. If you\u2019re not a binger, start at episode three (The L Word: Our Journey) where they really hit their stride: these two have an unfakeable warmth and chemistry that only comes from genuine friendship.",

      "body": "<p>Should we raise children the way we run businesses? I say we, though I have no idea how to run a business. Yet the number of books on the market that discuss parenting in terms one might use to discuss maximising an investment \u2013 to approach one\u2019s child as one might any other product launch \u2013 is simultaneously completely depressing and almost impossible to resist. Why wouldn\u2019t one want to turn out successful children? On the other hand: stuffing them from the age of three with skills best suited to careers in corporate law is surely an expensive and self-defeating insanity.</p> <p>In a new book, <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/13326.html\" title=\"\">Love, Money and Parenting: How Economics Explains the Way We Raise Our Kids</a>, two economists try to untangle the long-term impact of what has come to be known as \u201chelicopter parenting\u201d \u2013 the high-investment, high-involvement approach that, on the evidence of the book, increases test scores and the likelihood of kids graduating from college, even as other data suggests it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/18/over-controlled-toddlers-grow-up-unable-to-cope\" title=\"\">stresses kids out</a>.</p> <p>The research, by Fabrizio Zilibotti and Matthias Doepke, economists at, respectively, Yale and Northwestern,, shouldn\u2019t be surprising: when you stand over kids and make sure they perform, those who don\u2019t burn out will do better, in conventional terms, than those with parents who just let them get on with it. As middle-class parents throw more and more resources at their smaller and smaller families it is also, predictably, widening the inequality gap.</p> <p>The question, of course, is one of happiness and how we define \u201csuccess\u201d. It\u2019s a key word in all child-rearing tracts, yet for all the window-dressing about kindness and flexibility, it most commonly correlates with earnings. I would quite like it if my kids weren\u2019t still clogging up the family home when they\u2019re 30, and I\u2019ll be happy if they don\u2019t drop out of college. If one of them should say that happiness, to her, means training as a mime artist or a performance poet, I wonder how enthusiastic I\u2019ll manage to be.</p> <p>This question is a particularly heavy one in America, where the cost of health insurance keeps people in unhappy corporate jobs for years. It also flushes out all one\u2019s liberal hypocrisy. I recently went on a tour of a progressive private school in Manhattan, in which prospective parents thrilled at the freedoms afforded the kids while discreetly checking to make sure everyone still got into the Ivy League.</p> <p>For a moment, I considered myself resistant to this urge: let children be children, I thought smugly. At four, my kids are already in what feels like a rat race and the idea of tethering them to standardised tests for the next decade makes progressive school look wonderfully inviting.</p> <p>Then we went on a tour of the upper school and, showing us around the gym,, and the parent tour-guide informed us, \u201cWe don\u2019t believe in competitive sports.\u201d I nearly tipped over with the force of my eye roll. Good God, these children will sink when they get out into this horrible world and when the seas rise, they\u2019ll be last to the lifeboats. I\u2019ve recalibrated since then. The more one thinks, the more wrong-headed my response seems. It\u2019s the kind of Darwinian thinking that will bring about the very disaster we are prepping our kids to survive.</p> <p>\u2022 Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Yet the number of books on the market that discuss parenting in terms one might use to discuss maximising an investment \u2013 to approach one\u2019s child as one might any other product launch \u2013 is simultaneously completely depressing and almost impossible to resist. Why wouldn\u2019t one want to turn out successful children? On the other hand: stuffing them from the age of three with skills best suited to careers in corporate law is surely an expensive and self-defeating insanity. In a new book, Love, Money and Parenting: How Economics Explains the Way We Raise Our Kids, two economists try to untangle the long-term impact of what has come to be known as \u201chelicopter parenting\u201d \u2013 the high-investment, high-involvement approach that, on the evidence of the book, increases test scores and the likelihood of kids graduating from college, even as other data suggests it stresses kids out. The research, by Fabrizio Zilibotti and Matthias Doepke, economists at, respectively, Yale and Northwestern,, shouldn\u2019t be surprising: when you stand over kids and make sure they perform, those who don\u2019t burn out will do better, in conventional terms, than those with parents who just let them get on with it. As middle-class parents throw more and more resources at their smaller and smaller families it is also, predictably, widening the inequality gap. The question, of course, is one of happiness and how we define \u201csuccess\u201d. It\u2019s a key word in all child-rearing tracts, yet for all the window-dressing about kindness and flexibility, it most commonly correlates with earnings. I would quite like it if my kids weren\u2019t still clogging up the family home when they\u2019re 30, and I\u2019ll be happy if they don\u2019t drop out of college. If one of them should say that happiness, to her, means training as a mime artist or a performance poet, I wonder how enthusiastic I\u2019ll manage to be. This question is a particularly heavy one in America, where the cost of health insurance keeps people in unhappy corporate jobs for years. It also flushes out all one\u2019s liberal hypocrisy. I recently went on a tour of a progressive private school in Manhattan, in which prospective parents thrilled at the freedoms afforded the kids while discreetly checking to make sure everyone still got into the Ivy League. For a moment, I considered myself resistant to this urge: let children be children, I thought smugly. At four, my kids are already in what feels like a rat race and the idea of tethering them to standardised tests for the next decade makes progressive school look wonderfully inviting. Then we went on a tour of the upper school and, showing us around the gym,, and the parent tour-guide informed us, \u201cWe don\u2019t believe in competitive sports.\u201d I nearly tipped over with the force of my eye roll. Good God, these children will sink when they get out into this horrible world and when the seas rise, they\u2019ll be last to the lifeboats. I\u2019ve recalibrated since then. The more one thinks, the more wrong-headed my response seems. It\u2019s the kind of Darwinian thinking that will bring about the very disaster we are prepping our kids to survive. \u2022 Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>Chaka Khan has a question. \u201cWhat\u2019s that TV show, where it\u2019s just families sitting down and looking at the TV? Chat Box?\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/gogglebox\" title=\"\">Gogglebox</a>? She claps her hands delightedly. \u201cGogglebox \u2013 oh, I love that! And that quiz programme where the enforcer comes on and it\u2019s like a big black guy, or a big woman.\u201d</p> <p>Erm, The Chase?

She nods. \u201c<em>So</em> good. I like funny shit.\u201d</p> <p>It goes without saying that I didn\u2019t expect to end up discussing Bradley Walsh when I arrived to interview Khan, a woman who could call herself the Queen of Funk without much fear of starting an argument. A minute ago, we were talking about her vast influence over modern music, something that is evident from her new album, Hello Happiness, a collaboration with the producers <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artists/f2d807ad-3799-4a2e-9870-09f999b53e1a\" title=\"\">Sarah Ruba</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/mia-74-1238296\" title=\"\">Switch</a>, the latter best known for his work with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/mia\" title=\"\">MIA</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/28/major-lazer-peace-is-the-mission-review-diplo\" title=\"\">Major Lazer</a>. It is audibly the work of people who, as Khan puts it, \u201cmade it abundantly clear that they didn\u2019t have to Google me\u201d. Its sound is based on an intricate knowledge of her back catalogue \u2013 the vivid funk she recorded with Rufus 40 years ago, the effervescent disco of her early solo albums, the electronic dance-pop of her biggest hits \u2013 and given a subtle 21st-century makeover.</p> <p>Khan was telling me that she was less aware of her influence than she might be, because she doesn\u2019t really listen to music at home, preferring to relax in front of the telly. And now here we are, talking about Gogglebox and The Chase.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JG6D59k9U8Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JG6D59k9U8Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It is certainly an unexpected turn of events, but nothing about Khan\u2019s life or career seems straightforward. She was born Yvette Stevens 65 years ago in Hyde Park, a progressive, bohemian, racially mixed \u201cisland amid the madness\u201d of 50s and 60s Chicago: \u201cA great city, very rich in terms of the arts, but it\u2019s so racist it\u2019s hard get to the friggin\u2019 arts if you\u2019re black. You have to grow up in a specialised community, which mine was.\u201d Her mother was a strict Catholic, but her father was a beatnik: \u201cMy sister and I used to go on his nocturnal excursions by the lake in the park. The weed was thick in the air, the wine bottles were flowing, music was playing \u2013 as tight as it was, I had a pretty magical life.\u201d</p> <p>Her father remarried, to a civil rights activist who encouraged Khan to speak at rallies; by the age of 14, she had been recruited by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/30/black-panthers-prison-interviews-african-american-activism\" title=\"\">Black Panthers</a>. \u201cI was a kid, so they really just had me selling the Panther paper on the corner, barefoot in jeans. I was totally against all the sock hops and shit my school had to offer to keep the natives quiet. We used to call them \u2018slave gatherings\u2019. So, I had my combat boots on, my green khaki pants. I didn\u2019t feel in danger \u2013 it wasn\u2019t like that. We were doing the right thing. However, when a gun came into my hands, a .38 that I hid in my room \u2026 I\u2019m telling you, every moment I had that gun it changed me. I felt physically sick. I threw it away into Botany\u2019s Pond by Chicago University, then I felt better. That finished me with the Panthers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"180bf10df39f540ce66f1874e00e76d8188ddf14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/180bf10df39f540ce66f1874e00e76d8188ddf14/1280_95_3501_3501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chaka Khan in New York in 1975\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Khan in 1975: \u2018The thing was to have a white band with a black chick out front.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Len DeLessio/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead, she concentrated on her musical career, singing jingles, performing with a succession of bands in the clubs around Chicago\u2019s Rush Street before landing a gig with a racially mixed funk band called Rufus. \u201cThe thing back then was to have a white band with a black chick out front \u2013 that was major money, made the club owners interested.\u201d She laughs mordantly. \u201cAnother racist phase that passed through Chicago.\u201d</p> <p>With Khan on vocals, Rufus were an immediate sensation: she had both a hell of a voice and a precocious, raw stage presence. She was 17 years old when they were offered her a record deal, still legally a child. When her mother refused to sign the contract on her behalf, she got married to her boyfriend, lying to her parents that she was pregnant. By the time of their first hit, 1974\u2019s Stevie Wonder-penned <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pR--nDR88b0\" title=\"\">Tell Me Something Good</a>, she actually was. \u201cYeah, everything happened to me like that: bam. And, yeah, it left some scars, created some bad habits. Why wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Despite their success \u2013 six gold or platinum albums in five years, 25 hit singles on the US R&amp;B chart \u2013 Rufus were a highly combustible band. There were endless line-up changes. There were fistfights in the studio, issues with managers. \u201cI had nothing but rip-off artists, until just lately,\u201d she sighs. The atmosphere wasn\u2019t much helped when the record label started billing the band as Rufus featuring Chaka Khan, or by tension between the band members and Khan\u2019s second husband, Richard Holland. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want me to have a husband,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cWhen the band first went on tour, every night, after a gig, they would all do a walk-through of my room to make sure I was by myself. They didn\u2019t care who it was \u2013 no one could come and visit me. They were just very possessive of their little diamond.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually, Khan struck out on her own, scoring an immediate hit with the Ashford &amp; Simpson-penned <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMOg4xLZDwk\" title=\"\">I\u2019m Every Woman</a>. She kept making albums with Rufus out of \u201cguilt\u201d, although the results were often spectacular, not least 1979\u2019s superlative <a href=\"https://www.allmusic.com/album/masterjam-mw0000096521\" title=\"\">Masterjam</a>; ironically, their biggest hit together \u2013 1983\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycnuyo3MLbw\" title=\"\">Ain\u2019t Nobody</a> \u2013 came after Khan had left for good. Her solo career was soaring. With the producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jun/28/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Arif Mardin</a>, she made a succession of wonderful albums, on which, as she characteristically puts it, \u201cevery song\u2019s a motherfucker\u201d. She was prodigiously, intuitively talented \u2013 unable to read music, she would nevertheless arrange her own songs, singing the notes she wanted to the horn and string sections \u2013 and remarkably adaptable, throwing out albums of jazz standards alongside collaborations with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/aug/09/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1\" title=\"\">Rick James</a>. Just as Rufus had transitioned seamlessly from funk to disco, so Khan survived the disco backlash with barely a scratch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec20e772efe4ecc261848ff5dd51e7ea42deeaad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec20e772efe4ecc261848ff5dd51e7ea42deeaad/0_217_4175_2504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Khan in 1975, when her band Rufus were riding high in the US charts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Khan in 1975, when her band Rufus were riding high in the US charts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anwar Hussein/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But behind the scenes, Khan\u2019s life was going haywire. She ended up locked in battles with her record label. \u201cAssholes,\u201d she says, flatly. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know how to work me, what category to put me in. Hell, they didn\u2019t have a clue. I get it \u2013 no category. That means do everything \u2013 let\u2019s do it all! But, see, that\u2019s too much work for them. I went in one time, they\u2019d hired another A&amp;R, who told me: \u2018We need you to sound like Mary J Blige.\u2019 I said: \u2018You motherfuckers need to get Mary J Blige then, and leave me alone.\u2019 That\u2019s when I really decided, \u2018I\u2019m done.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She struggled with addiction \u2013 to cocaine, heroin and alcohol \u2013 for most of her adult life. Remarkably, it did not seem to interfere with her career: by her own admission, she was \u201cgetting fucked up\u201d throughout her commercial peak. \u201cVery good at compartmentalising,\u201d she nods. \u201cAll through the 80s, I knew when to abstain, I really did. I had lines of demarcation in my life, and I practised them. And, also, I was very aware of my health; that was important to me. When I was with the Panthers, my girlfriends and I were all into breaking our own bread, taking our herbs, fasting one week out of every month. So there were certain other habits I got that I never did stop. It was the healthy living that brought me through drugs alive, I\u2019m sure of it. I would get massively fucked-up for a couple of weeks and then I\u2019d take, like, a herbal shut-down where I\u2019d stop and just go on plants. So that helped me a lot.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was the healthy living that brought me through drugs alive, I\u2019m sure of it</p> <footer> <cite>Chaka Khan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She says her last bout in rehab \u2013 for an addiction to opiate painkillers prescribed after a knee replacement operation \u2013 was provoked by the death of Prince in 2016. They were close friends \u2013 he wrote her 1984 UK No 1 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObjLb6ElTvs\" title=\"\">I Feel For You</a>, and they regularly collaborated. She signed to his NPG label in the late 90s, resulting in the brilliant overlooked album <a href=\"https://www.allmusic.com/album/come-2-my-house-mw0000600970\" title=\"\">Come 2 My House</a> \u2013 although her interactions with him seem to have been as bizarre as everyone else\u2019s. They met when he rang her hotel room in San Francisco, pretending, for reasons best known to himself, to be Sly Stone. \u201cI could have sworn it was Sly; Sly and I were very close. He said: \u2018I\u2019m at a studio in Marin County doing this album, do you want to come?\u2019 So I drove for 100 years and get in there and it\u2019s like dark and sterile and very eerie. There\u2019s this little guy with a guitar. I said: \u2018Excuse me, where\u2019s Sly?\u2019 and he put his guitar down and said: \u2018I\u2019m sorry, that was me.\u2019 \u2018Well, who the fuck are you?\u2019 I was truly pissed about this. He told me who he was, I said: \u2018OK, nice meeting you, but I\u2019m really pissed now, so goodbye\u2019, and I left.\u201d</p> <p>She says she had no idea of the extent of the Prince\u2019s own issues with painkillers. \u201cI never, ever got any indication that he was on pills. I knew he was doing certain things, I knew he had a couple of bouts with acid and all that. That\u2019s OK. A one-off here and there, you got the money, you ain\u2019t working. You like acid \u2013 go do it. But he was totally against drinking; he\u2019d drink red wine occasionally, not a lot. He starved himself \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t eat unless it was this or that; he was very particular. What comes to mind is someone who was very health conscious as opposed to \u2026\u201d Her voice trails off and she shakes her head. \u201cSecrets kill. Secrets kill, and if he hid from me for so many years where he was really at, and I was like his confidante in many ways, you know \u2026 It\u2019s hard to keep a secret like that from me.

      "bodyText": "Chaka Khan has a question. \u201cWhat\u2019s that TV show, where it\u2019s just families sitting down and looking at the TV? Chat Box?\u201d Gogglebox? She claps her hands delightedly. \u201cGogglebox \u2013 oh, I love that! And that quiz programme where the enforcer comes on and it\u2019s like a big black guy, or a big woman.\u201d Erm, The Chase? With Bradley Walsh? She nods. \u201cSo good. I like funny shit.\u201d It goes without saying that I didn\u2019t expect to end up discussing Bradley Walsh when I arrived to interview Khan, a woman who could call herself the Queen of Funk without much fear of starting an argument. A minute ago, we were talking about her vast influence over modern music, something that is evident from her new album, Hello Happiness, a collaboration with the producers Sarah Ruba and Switch, the latter best known for his work with MIA and Major Lazer. It is audibly the work of people who, as Khan puts it, \u201cmade it abundantly clear that they didn\u2019t have to Google me\u201d. Its sound is based on an intricate knowledge of her back catalogue \u2013 the vivid funk she recorded with Rufus 40 years ago, the effervescent disco of her early solo albums, the electronic dance-pop of her biggest hits \u2013 and given a subtle 21st-century makeover. Khan was telling me that she was less aware of her influence than she might be, because she doesn\u2019t really listen to music at home, preferring to relax in front of the telly. And now here we are, talking about Gogglebox and The Chase. It is certainly an unexpected turn of events, but nothing about Khan\u2019s life or career seems straightforward. She was born Yvette Stevens 65 years ago in Hyde Park, a progressive, bohemian, racially mixed \u201cisland amid the madness\u201d of 50s and 60s Chicago: \u201cA great city, very rich in terms of the arts, but it\u2019s so racist it\u2019s hard get to the friggin\u2019 arts if you\u2019re black. You have to grow up in a specialised community, which mine was.\u201d Her mother was a strict Catholic, but her father was a beatnik: \u201cMy sister and I used to go on his nocturnal excursions by the lake in the park. The weed was thick in the air, the wine bottles were flowing, music was playing \u2013 as tight as it was, I had a pretty magical life.\u201d Her father remarried, to a civil rights activist who encouraged Khan to speak at rallies; by the age of 14, she had been recruited by the Black Panthers. \u201cI was a kid, so they really just had me selling the Panther paper on the corner, barefoot in jeans. I was totally against all the sock hops and shit my school had to offer to keep the natives quiet. We used to call them \u2018slave gatherings\u2019. So, I had my combat boots on, my green khaki pants. I didn\u2019t feel in danger \u2013 it wasn\u2019t like that. We were doing the right thing. However, when a gun came into my hands, a .38 that I hid in my room \u2026 I\u2019m telling you, every moment I had that gun it changed me. I felt physically sick. I threw it away into Botany\u2019s Pond by Chicago University, then I felt better. That finished me with the Panthers.\u201d Instead, she concentrated on her musical career, singing jingles, performing with a succession of bands in the clubs around Chicago\u2019s Rush Street before landing a gig with a racially mixed funk band called Rufus. \u201cThe thing back then was to have a white band with a black chick out front \u2013 that was major money, made the club owners interested.\u201d She laughs mordantly. \u201cAnother racist phase that passed through Chicago.\u201d With Khan on vocals, Rufus were an immediate sensation: she had both a hell of a voice and a precocious, raw stage presence. She was 17 years old when they were offered her a record deal, still legally a child. When her mother refused to sign the contract on her behalf, she got married to her boyfriend, lying to her parents that she was pregnant. By the time of their first hit, 1974\u2019s Stevie Wonder-penned Tell Me Something Good, she actually was. \u201cYeah, everything happened to me like that: bam. And, yeah, it left some scars, created some bad habits. Why wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d Despite their success \u2013 six gold or platinum albums in five years, 25 hit singles on the US R&amp;B chart \u2013 Rufus were a highly combustible band. There were endless line-up changes. There were fistfights in the studio, issues with managers. \u201cI had nothing but rip-off artists, until just lately,\u201d she sighs. The atmosphere wasn\u2019t much helped when the record label started billing the band as Rufus featuring Chaka Khan, or by tension between the band members and Khan\u2019s second husband, Richard Holland. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want me to have a husband,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cWhen the band first went on tour, every night, after a gig, they would all do a walk-through of my room to make sure I was by myself. They didn\u2019t care who it was \u2013 no one could come and visit me. They were just very possessive of their little diamond.\u201d Eventually, Khan struck out on her own, scoring an immediate hit with the Ashford &amp; Simpson-penned I\u2019m Every Woman. She kept making albums with Rufus out of \u201cguilt\u201d, although the results were often spectacular, not least 1979\u2019s superlative Masterjam; ironically, their biggest hit together \u2013 1983\u2019s Ain\u2019t Nobody \u2013 came after Khan had left for good. Her solo career was soaring. With the producer Arif Mardin, she made a succession of wonderful albums, on which, as she characteristically puts it, \u201cevery song\u2019s a motherfucker\u201d. She was prodigiously, intuitively talented \u2013 unable to read music, she would nevertheless arrange her own songs, singing the notes she wanted to the horn and string sections \u2013 and remarkably adaptable, throwing out albums of jazz standards alongside collaborations with Rick James. Just as Rufus had transitioned seamlessly from funk to disco, so Khan survived the disco backlash with barely a scratch. But behind the scenes, Khan\u2019s life was going haywire. She ended up locked in battles with her record label. \u201cAssholes,\u201d she says, flatly. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know how to work me, what category to put me in. Hell, they didn\u2019t have a clue. I get it \u2013 no category. That means do everything \u2013 let\u2019s do it all! But, see, that\u2019s too much work for them. I went in one time, they\u2019d hired another A&amp;R, who told me: \u2018We need you to sound like Mary J Blige.\u2019 I said: \u2018You motherfuckers need to get Mary J Blige then, and leave me alone.\u2019 That\u2019s when I really decided, \u2018I\u2019m done.\u2019\u201d She struggled with addiction \u2013 to cocaine, heroin and alcohol \u2013 for most of her adult life. Remarkably, it did not seem to interfere with her career: by her own admission, she was \u201cgetting fucked up\u201d throughout her commercial peak. \u201cVery good at compartmentalising,\u201d she nods. \u201cAll through the 80s, I knew when to abstain, I really did. I had lines of demarcation in my life, and I practised them. And, also, I was very aware of my health; that was important to me. When I was with the Panthers, my girlfriends and I were all into breaking our own bread, taking our herbs, fasting one week out of every month. So there were certain other habits I got that I never did stop. It was the healthy living that brought me through drugs alive, I\u2019m sure of it. I would get massively fucked-up for a couple of weeks and then I\u2019d take, like, a herbal shut-down where I\u2019d stop and just go on plants. So that helped me a lot.\u201d She says her last bout in rehab \u2013 for an addiction to opiate painkillers prescribed after a knee replacement operation \u2013 was provoked by the death of Prince in 2016. They were close friends \u2013 he wrote her 1984 UK No 1 I Feel For You, and they regularly collaborated. She signed to his NPG label in the late 90s, resulting in the brilliant overlooked album Come 2 My House \u2013 although her interactions with him seem to have been as bizarre as everyone else\u2019s. They met when he rang her hotel room in San Francisco, pretending, for reasons best known to himself, to be Sly Stone. \u201cI could have sworn it was Sly; Sly and I were very close. He said: \u2018I\u2019m at a studio in Marin County doing this album, do you want to come?\u2019 So I drove for 100 years and get in there and it\u2019s like dark and sterile and very eerie. There\u2019s this little guy with a guitar. I said: \u2018Excuse me, where\u2019s Sly?\u2019 and he put his guitar down and said: \u2018I\u2019m sorry, that was me.\u2019 \u2018Well, who the fuck are you?\u2019 I was truly pissed about this. He told me who he was, I said: \u2018OK, nice meeting you, but I\u2019m really pissed now, so goodbye\u2019, and I left.\u201d She says she had no idea of the extent of the Prince\u2019s own issues with painkillers. \u201cI never, ever got any indication that he was on pills. I knew he was doing certain things, I knew he had a couple of bouts with acid and all that. That\u2019s OK. A one-off here and there, you got the money, you ain\u2019t working. You like acid \u2013 go do it. But he was totally against drinking; he\u2019d drink red wine occasionally, not a lot. He starved himself \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t eat unless it was this or that; he was very particular. What comes to mind is someone who was very health conscious as opposed to \u2026\u201d Her voice trails off and she shakes her head. \u201cSecrets kill. Secrets kill, and if he hid from me for so many years where he was really at, and I was like his confidante in many ways, you know \u2026 It\u2019s hard to keep a secret like that from me. So I learned a lot, you know. I just said: \u2018I better go check myself.\u2019 And I\u2019m alive maybe because he\u2019s dead. I went to a doctor and I said, \u2018Here\u2019s the deal\u2019, and he told me there are certain pains you\u2019ve just got to live with, that\u2019s part of life.\u201d These days, she is a teetotal vegan, her only vice the packet of cigarettes on the table in front of her.

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Though assaults by so-called <em>fedayeen</em> (\u201cthose who sacrifice themselves\u201d) who will fight to the death are relatively common in Kashmir, Thursday\u2019s attack is the first using a car bomb in 19 years.

      "bodyText": "Dozens of Indian paramilitaries have been killed in the first suicide car bombing in the disputed region of Kashmir in nearly two decades. A lone militant is believed to have driven a vehicle laden with explosives close to a central reserve police force (CRPF) convoy and detonated it just after 3pm on Thursday on a busy highway outside the state capital of Srinagar. \u201cThe convoy was coming into Kashmir valley and was hit by a vehicle explosion which was carried out by a suicide bomber,\u201d Sanjay Sharma, a CRPF spokesman, said. \u201cIt was a very powerful explosion and a bus has been completely shredded.\u201d Photographs from the scene showed the blackened, twisted remains of a vehicle surrounded by debris. No official death toll has been announced, but a senior police source in Srinagar told the Guardian 33 people had been killed and the toll is expected to rise as more of the dead are identified. A former Jammu and Kashmir state police chief, SP Vaid, tweeted that 42 people had been killed which, if true, would make the attack one of the deadliest outside of a war zone in the country\u2019s history. The attack took place on a heavily guarded highway that serves as a key supply route for troops stationed in the Kashmir valley and along the ceasefire line with Pakistan. There were about 2,500 troops travelling in the convoy and more than 40 soldiers were on the bus that was targeted. India\u2019s prime minister Narendra Modi on Friday promised a strong response. \u201cWe will give a befitting reply, our neighbour will not be allowed to de-stabilise us,\u201d Modi said in a speech soon after he called his security advisers to consider a response to the attack. The Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed claimed responsibility for the bombing. It said it was carried out by Adil Ahmad Dar, a locally recruited fighter from south Kashmir\u2019s Pulwama district. The group released a video showing Dar delivering his will and a photograph of him surrounded by guns and grenades. Militant groups have been fighting Indian security forces in Kashmir for 30 years. Control of the Himalayan region is divided between India and Pakistan and claimed in full by both, with a smaller patch administered by China. Though assaults by so-called fedayeen (\u201cthose who sacrifice themselves\u201d) who will fight to the death are relatively common in Kashmir, Thursday\u2019s attack is the first using a car bomb in 19 years. It follows the deadliest year for militants in a decade. Three gunfights this week left eight insurgents and one Indian soldier dead. The last car bomb attack in Kashmir was carried out in 2000 by a Birmingham-born man who was using the name Mohammad Bilal. Jaish-e-Mohammed is designated by the UN and Britain as a terrorist group and is alleged to have links to elements within the Pakistani government. China has repeatedly blocked attempts by the Indian government to have the UN security council declare the group\u2019s leader, Masood Azhar, a terrorist. The group carried out the most recent major attack in Kashmir in September 2016, when its fighters stormed an army camp in Uri, a garrison town near the ceasefire line with Pakistan, and killed 19 soldiers. That attack prompted India to announce it had carried out an incursion into Pakistan-controlled Kashmir to destroy a militant staging ground, an operation referred to as \u201csurgical strikes\u201d and turned into a patriotic blockbuster film that is currently screening. \u201cThe Pakistanis are wanting to up the ante again ahead of the election,\u201d said Khalid Shah, an associate fellow at the Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation. India will hold general elections starting in April. Modi, called the bombing despicable. \u201cI strongly condemn this dastardly attack,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThe sacrifices of our brave security personnel shall not go in vain. The entire nation stands shoulder to shoulder with the families of the brave martyrs. May the injured recover quickly.\u201d Rahul Gandhi, the president of the main opposition Congress party, sent condolences to the victims. \u201cI\u2019m deeply disturbed by the cowardly attack on a CRPF convoy \u2026 in which 10 of our brave men have been martyred and many others wounded,\u201d he said, quoting an earlier death toll. The fact the alleged perpetrator was Kashmiri reflects a growing radicalisation of local youths in a militancy that was once dominated by Pakistani or Afghan fighters crossing the border. \u201cThat is the most worrying factor,\u201d Shah said. He said the Modi government appeared not to have a coherent policy in the region since 2016, when the killing of the militant leader Burhan Wani sparked mass protests that continued for months and which were often met with force by Indian security personnel. \u201cThe government has focused on the number of terrorists killed in a particular year, but it\u2019s lost sight of the fact that the recruitment of Kashmiri boys has gone up from 88 in 2016 \u2026 to 191 last year,\u201d he said. Modi campaigned in 2014 promising to adopt a hardline approach to militancy in Kashmir, and, with the election campaign about to begin in earnest, he is likely to face pressure from his Hindu nationalist supporters to respond strongly to this latest attack.",

There are very few native winter-flowering plants, making it unlikely that colonies could survive in the countryside, but the profusion of winter-flowering shrubs and perennials planted by gardeners provides nectar to fuel their flight and pollen as a source of protein. Buff-tails forage on a large variety of species, and studies show that winter-active bumblebees can attain foraging rates for nectar and pollen that match, or even surpass, those recorded during the summer. During the past two weeks, I have observed several queens and smaller \u201cworker\u201d females visiting my rosemary, sweet box, forsythia, mahonia, cyclamens and daphne. It is estimated that a full honey stomach gives a bumblebee just 40 minutes of flight time, so when I spotted an immobile queen clinging to an unopened snowdrop, my first thought was that she was in a state of torpor, suffering from the cold and depleted energy reserves. But upon closer inspection, I realised she was \u201cnectar robbing\u201d \u2013 feeding without pollinating the plant. Short-tongued bumblebees find tubular flowers problematic, as they can\u2019t reach the nectaries concealed deep within. Undeterred, this queen had bitten a hole near the base of the petals, poking her proboscis through to suck out the nectar. Sated, she flew away, leaving a pinhead-sized perforation in the corolla as evidence of her floral larceny.",

In the past two decades, antisemitic attacks in Europe have generally peaked in line with tensions in the Middle East. \u201cThey were essentially the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, imported,\u201d said Marc Knobel, a historian at the Crif umbrella group for France\u2019s Jewish organisations. \u201cRather than attacking Israelis, people went for Jews.\u201d But since early last year, said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Potier of the French government\u2019s anti-racism and antisemitism body Dilcrah, more traditional forms of antisemitism have re-emerged. \u201cWe are witnessing the resurgence of a virulent, far-right identity politics that does not hesitate to put its beliefs into action,\u201d Potier told Le Monde. Knobel said the taboos around antisemitism \u201chad all but disappeared\u201d, pointing to the re-emergence of longstanding antisemitic tropes involving Jews and money. In France, for example, he told Lib\u00e9ration, the fact that Macron previously worked for the Rothschild merchant bank had \u201cfuelled a load of rumours\u201d. Experts describe a \u201cperfect storm\u201d for antisemitic attacks combining the increasing influence of far-right groups and governments; the rise of conspiracy theories about a supposed global Zionist plot (and the scale on which they circulate on social media); and a general increase in the violence of public discourse. Although the most recent rise in antisemitic incidents in France began before the emergence of the anti-establishment gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement, some have occurred during their weekly Saturday demonstrations. A recent poll suggested nearly half of yellow vest protesters believed in a \u201cZionist plot\u201d. In Germany, home to Europe\u2019s third largest Jewish community after France and Britain, the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party has been widely accused of fomenting hate against refugees, Muslims and Jews. The party\u2019s co-leader, Alexander Gauland, described the Holocaust as a \u201csmall bird dropping in over 1,000 years of successful German history\u201d, while another senior AfD politician, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, called the Holocaust memorial in Berlin a \u201cmonument of shame\u201d. A large influx of mostly Muslim refugees and migrants to Germany from 2015 has also led to a rise in antisemitic attacks by migrants from Arab states, although figures show an overwhelming majority of violence against Jews is perpetrated by far-right supporters. \u201cMilitant rightwing extremists are now openly calling for the desecration of Jewish institutions and attacks against Jewish people,\u201d Pau said. Some governments, particularly in eastern Europe, stand accused of at best tolerating racism and antisemitism, and at worst encouraging it. Hungary\u2019s far-right Fidesz party, led by prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has run vitriolic campaigns against migrants and demonising George Soros, the Hungarian-born Jewish financier. In CNN\u2019s recent survey, 42% of Hungarians polled said they thought Jews held too much sway over the worlds of finance and international affairs. While an average of one in 10 Europeans said they personally had an \u201cunfavourable attitude\u201d to Jews, the figure rose to nearly 15% in Poland and 19% in Hungary. The European council late last year adopted a declaration urging all EU members to increase their efforts to \u201cprevent and combat all forms of antisemitism\u201d, as well as \u201cassure the security of Jewish communities, institutions and citizens\u201d. But the bloc\u2019s Fundamental Rights Agency said a \u201cwave\u201d of anti-Jewish hate crime was threatening \u201cthe very values on which the union was built\u201d. After swastikas were daubed this week on portraits on Paris postboxes of Simone Veil, the late French Holocaust survivor and politician, Jean Veil, her son, told RTL radio that \u201cat bottom, we knew the leprosy was still there\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "New Zealand has become the latest target of a propaganda campaign in China\u2019s state-run media, with the English language Global Times newspaper claiming that tourists are cancelling their holidays in retaliation for the country banning Huawei from being involved in the 5G rollout. In November national telecommunications company Spark was temporarily banned from using Huawei equipment in the rollout after New Zealand\u2019s spy agency warned it would pose \u201csignificant national security risks\u201d. A report in the English-language Global Times newspaper, a tabloid arm of the Communist party\u2019s official newspaper group, quoted a Beijing resident identified as \u201cLi\u201d, saying that as a result he planned to cancel his holiday to the country and go elsewhere instead. \u201cIs it a kind of robbery? New Zealand stabbed us in the back but asks for our money? This is double-faced,\u201d the paper quoted him as saying. The report, which was picked up by New Zealand media, comes amid a period of unusually tense relations between the two nations. Over the past month a major tourism event between the two countries was put indefinitely on hold, an Air New Zealand plane was turned back from Shanghai, and telecommunications company Huawei launched a high-profile advertising blitz, aimed at pressuring the government to sign off on its participation with the nation-wide 5G rollout. A visit by the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, to Beijing was cancelled late in 2018 with no new date confirmed. Associate Professor Jason Young, the director of the New Zealand contemporary China research centre at Victoria university, said he had not been able to find an equivalent of the Global Times article in the Chinese-language press \u2013 strongly suggesting the piece was aimed at a New Zealand audience only. The Huawei ban and the Pacific \u201creset\u201d \u2013 New Zealand\u2019s strengthening of ties in the Pacific region to counter growing Chinese influence \u2013 have made the New Zealand\u2013China relationship \u201cmuch bumpier\u201d than under the previous National government, Young says. Other, smaller stressors, have added to the tension. \u201cChina\u2019s relationship with a number of western countries over the last couple of years have been quite rocky, especially with the United States. For New Zealand, we\u2019re not immune to such international trends, but we also have a long relationship and there\u2019s a lot of good things continuing,\u201d Young said. New Zealand had close to half a million Chinese tourists in 2018, make it the second-largest source of visitors after Australia. The opposition National party\u2019s leader, Simon Bridges, said the government\u2019s \u201csteadily deteriorating relations\u201d with China were putting the valuable trading relationship at risk. But Ardern said that while the two countries had their \u201cchallenges\u201d their ties remained robust.",

      "body": "<p>Opening this week at New York\u2019s Public Theater is a pair of inspired one-act monologues, Sea Wall and A Life, the former starring Tom Sturridge and the latter Jake Gyllenhaal.</p> <p>Watching these memory pieces, which together achieve a tonally ambitious mix of blunt truth and wistful, freewheeling evocation, I recalled a quote from the writer Eudora Welty\u2019s memoir. \u201cThe events in our lives happen in a sequence in time, but in their significance to ourself they find their own order,\u201d she wrote, rendering grief and family with mercy and clarity. \u201cThe time as we know it subjectively is often the chronology that stories and novels follow: it is the continuous thread of revelation.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/feb/12/freestyle-love-supreme-review-lin-manuel-mirandas-hip-hop-improv\">Freestyle Love Supreme review \u2013 Lin Manuel Miranda's hip-hop improv</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sea Wall and A Life, written respectively by Simon Stephens and Nick Payne, are composed of certain Welty-like revelations about birth, death and fatherhood, the events of each monologue recounted with the spontaneous lucidity in which memory is often bathed. The plays are exercises in narrative storytelling, arranged around massive, life-changing events but punctuated by hyper-specific recollections of courtship and domesticity: basting a chicken, watching ER, mistaking vitamin drops for lavender oil. Directed by Carrie Cracknell, who helmed the Brooklyn Academy of Music\u2019s 2014 production of A Doll\u2019s House, the monologues are sufficiently distinct, though similar enough thematically to function successfully as companion pieces, totally disarming in the depth and intensity of the emotions they conjure.</p> <p>In the first monologue, Sea Wall, a photographer named Alex (Sturridge) speaks directly to the audience about his wife Helen, their daughter Lucy, and his father-in-law, a British war veteran fond of tennis metaphors who lives in the south of France. With boyish, unaffected enthusiasm, Sturridge whips through memories of the couple\u2019s early days, the birth of their daughter by C-section, the warm, detailed minutiae that, when accumulated, amount to something like a shared life. Recalling that his wife called him \u201cgentle\u201d, Alex, standing alone on a harshly lit stage, turns bashful, as if divulging a secret. \u201cI had absolutely no idea that people thought I was gentle, and she says she really likes this bit,\u201d he says, pointing to his upper arm. \u201cThis bit is one of the best bits of a man, she says, which is a phrase that just about sends me completely insane with love for her and her nose and her smile and everything.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7c63c29a327f3b98ac98409d37bf124daf765d35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c63c29a327f3b98ac98409d37bf124daf765d35/0_38_1520_1898/801.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Sturridge on stage in the Off-Broadway play Sea Wall/A Life.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Sturridge on stage in the Off-Broadway play Sea Wall/A Life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joan Marcus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Peppered throughout are reflections on the number pi, the existence of God, and the limits of knowledge, bits of Beckett-speak that might have seemed like shallow attempts at profundity were the monologue not ultimately anchored in a tragic final act and, crucially, the gestural particularity of Sturridge\u2019s performance. On stage he wears baggy sweatpants and several layers on top, but Sturridge makes Alex seem bare to the bone, adding to Stephens\u2019 observant script the impression of a mind at work.</p> <p>Equaling him in the second monologue is Gyllenhaal, who\u2019s slowly building a theatrical resum\u00e9 to match his work on film \u2013 most recently, he was irresistible in the revival of Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Sunday in the Park with George, and A Life marks his second collaboration with Nick Payne after 2015\u2019s Constellations.</p> <p>Here, playing a man on the verge of fatherhood, and whose father is on the brink of death, Gyllenhaal is especially tender; his mode of storytelling is different from Alex\u2019s, fixated more heavily on momentary recollections of family and its absence than sweeping philosophical questions, though mortality is never far from his mind. \u201cI am in awe of my wife\u2019s cervix,\u201d he says, with the harried but amiable charm Gyllenhaal\u2019s mastered. \u201cI read somewhere that being born is to risk death.\u201d The monologue runs on this kind of interplay between sincerity and comic relief: the character\u2019s amusing, neurotic narration of his wife\u2019s delivery lands on the moment when the baby, resembling \u201can ever-so-slightly over-sized heart,\u201d is placed in his hands. Gyllenhaal\u2019s eyes widen and a kind of fleeting calm overtakes him.</p> <p>The dual, male-fronted monologues might not be in vogue, what with our much-belated emphasis on foregrounding stories of female subjectivity. But the double feature of Sea Wall/A Life is a refreshing and moving departure from male tropes; these characters are neither heroic nor antiheroic, and they\u2019re not absent fathers, sons and husbands. In their nakedness and fragility, they reckon with the responsibilities those labels entail.

      "bodyText": "Opening this week at New York\u2019s Public Theater is a pair of inspired one-act monologues, Sea Wall and A Life, the former starring Tom Sturridge and the latter Jake Gyllenhaal. Watching these memory pieces, which together achieve a tonally ambitious mix of blunt truth and wistful, freewheeling evocation, I recalled a quote from the writer Eudora Welty\u2019s memoir. \u201cThe events in our lives happen in a sequence in time, but in their significance to ourself they find their own order,\u201d she wrote, rendering grief and family with mercy and clarity. \u201cThe time as we know it subjectively is often the chronology that stories and novels follow: it is the continuous thread of revelation.\u201d Sea Wall and A Life, written respectively by Simon Stephens and Nick Payne, are composed of certain Welty-like revelations about birth, death and fatherhood, the events of each monologue recounted with the spontaneous lucidity in which memory is often bathed. The plays are exercises in narrative storytelling, arranged around massive, life-changing events but punctuated by hyper-specific recollections of courtship and domesticity: basting a chicken, watching ER, mistaking vitamin drops for lavender oil. Directed by Carrie Cracknell, who helmed the Brooklyn Academy of Music\u2019s 2014 production of A Doll\u2019s House, the monologues are sufficiently distinct, though similar enough thematically to function successfully as companion pieces, totally disarming in the depth and intensity of the emotions they conjure. In the first monologue, Sea Wall, a photographer named Alex (Sturridge) speaks directly to the audience about his wife Helen, their daughter Lucy, and his father-in-law, a British war veteran fond of tennis metaphors who lives in the south of France. With boyish, unaffected enthusiasm, Sturridge whips through memories of the couple\u2019s early days, the birth of their daughter by C-section, the warm, detailed minutiae that, when accumulated, amount to something like a shared life. Recalling that his wife called him \u201cgentle\u201d, Alex, standing alone on a harshly lit stage, turns bashful, as if divulging a secret. \u201cI had absolutely no idea that people thought I was gentle, and she says she really likes this bit,\u201d he says, pointing to his upper arm. \u201cThis bit is one of the best bits of a man, she says, which is a phrase that just about sends me completely insane with love for her and her nose and her smile and everything.\u201d Peppered throughout are reflections on the number pi, the existence of God, and the limits of knowledge, bits of Beckett-speak that might have seemed like shallow attempts at profundity were the monologue not ultimately anchored in a tragic final act and, crucially, the gestural particularity of Sturridge\u2019s performance. On stage he wears baggy sweatpants and several layers on top, but Sturridge makes Alex seem bare to the bone, adding to Stephens\u2019 observant script the impression of a mind at work. Equaling him in the second monologue is Gyllenhaal, who\u2019s slowly building a theatrical resum\u00e9 to match his work on film \u2013 most recently, he was irresistible in the revival of Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Sunday in the Park with George, and A Life marks his second collaboration with Nick Payne after 2015\u2019s Constellations. Here, playing a man on the verge of fatherhood, and whose father is on the brink of death, Gyllenhaal is especially tender; his mode of storytelling is different from Alex\u2019s, fixated more heavily on momentary recollections of family and its absence than sweeping philosophical questions, though mortality is never far from his mind. \u201cI am in awe of my wife\u2019s cervix,\u201d he says, with the harried but amiable charm Gyllenhaal\u2019s mastered. \u201cI read somewhere that being born is to risk death.\u201d The monologue runs on this kind of interplay between sincerity and comic relief: the character\u2019s amusing, neurotic narration of his wife\u2019s delivery lands on the moment when the baby, resembling \u201can ever-so-slightly over-sized heart,\u201d is placed in his hands. Gyllenhaal\u2019s eyes widen and a kind of fleeting calm overtakes him. The dual, male-fronted monologues might not be in vogue, what with our much-belated emphasis on foregrounding stories of female subjectivity. But the double feature of Sea Wall/A Life is a refreshing and moving departure from male tropes; these characters are neither heroic nor antiheroic, and they\u2019re not absent fathers, sons and husbands. In their nakedness and fragility, they reckon with the responsibilities those labels entail. And Cracknell, Sturridge and Gyllenhaal, working with emotionally precise scripts, bring two human, no-frills stories to life.",

Commissioner Margaret McMurdo described the positions of the six informants in a bid to combat \u201cmisinformation\u201d about their identities, which have been the subject of intense gossip and speculation in legal fraternities and the media since Victoria police revealed that Lawyer X was not the only legal source on their books. In the first directions hearing to the royal commission into the use of police informants in Melbourne on Friday, McMurdo said a letter from Victoria police, dated 2014 but only recently provided to the commission, said that \u201canother lawyer, now deceased, had previously provided information to Victoria police\u201d. That lawyer has been identified in some media reports as murdered mafia lawyer Joe Acquaro. The other six informants include a court clerk, who was registered as a police informer from January 2015 to May 2016, when they were deemed \u201cunreliable and too \u2018risky\u2019 to be used\u201d. The other informants were a court clerk or legal secretary who \u201cdid not appear to be \u2026 a practising lawyer\u201d, registered from October 2009 to May 2016; a legal secretary who was registered as a community contact from January to May 2015; a solicitor registered as a community contact from April to May 2014 and did not inform on their own clients; a former solicitor who was considered and dismissed for use as an informant for three days in February 2015; and a \u201cself-proclaimed legal adviser\u201d who was registered for just over a month from December 2016 to January 2016. The royal commission was called in December following the publication of a unanimous high court decision ordering that former clients of a person known variously as Lawyer X, Informer 3838, or EF be told that they were acting as a police informant. Lawyer X\u2019s identity is still suppressed. The high court\u2019s decision followed years of attempts by both the lawyer and Victoria police to block the release of the information, which they said would put the life of the lawyer and their family at risk. McMurdo said that the use of a lawyer as a police informant was a breach of fundamental principles of the legal system. \u201cThe police use of lawyers to inform on their clients has obvious potential to undermine the criminal justice system and the public\u2019s confidence in it,\u201d she said. If that happened, she said, \u201cthe criminal justice system would regress into a dysfunctional, far more costly, clogged quagmire of universal distrust.\u201d It could undermine past convictions. In Lawyer X\u2019s case the convictions of 22 people, including gangland figure Tony Mokbel, could be impacted. \u201cThe whole costly, clandestine and unlawful exercise cannot legitimately achieve its original goal,\u201d McMurdo said. \u201cAll it achieves is to undermine the very criminal justice system legal practitioners and police officers are duty bound to uphold and serve.\u201d Chris Winneke QC, counsel assisting the commissioner, said that ignoring obligations of legal privilege could \u201csee guilty offenders walk free\u201d. Winnike said Lawyer X was expected to \u201ccooperatively assist the commission with its investigation\u201d and that it was \u201cexpected that all relevant witnesses will be examined, whether voluntarily, or by compulsion\u201d. He said the commission would examine recordings of Lawyer X talking to their police handler, as well as diaries recording those interactions. Documents have been sought from 40 other individuals and entities. Public hearings are expected to begin late March and the commission is due to report on 1 July about cases specifically relating to Lawyer X. McMurdo is conducting the commission alone after her co-commissioner, former South Australian police commissioner Malcolm Hyde, declared a conflict of interest and resigned.",

He\u2019s also evaluating the authority that he has and I know he\u2019ll be making a decision before the deadline this Friday. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-14T18:41:41.242Z\">at 6.41pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c6599f9e4b05934c2e33252\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-14T16:41:55.506Z\">4.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A Maryland prosecutor has charged a college student for illegal wiretapping because he streamed a video of a meeting with a congressional staffer on Facebook Live.</p> \n  <p>The college student was lobbying Republican Andy Harris to support marijuana legalization and live streamed a meeting on the topic with one of Harris\u2019s staffers.

      "bodyText": "Follow the latest developments on our new live blog. Happy Valentine\u2019s Day everyone, it\u2019s been a doozy. Here\u2019s what happened today: Congress passed a bipartisan agreement preventing the government from shutting down. Trump has pledged to sign it. The bill gives him $1.375bn for his border wall, far less than the $5.7bn requested, and the president is planning to declare a national emergency to get more funding. Details on the declaration are scant but critics from both parties were quick to oppose the move, and reportedly, it will not get through the courts, at least on the first try. Trump administration officials told reporters they plan to win in an appeal. Trump has gained some weight since his last official physical and based on the weight provided by his doctors, the president is now considered obese. The House passed the spending package tonight with a vote of 300-128, following the Senate\u2019s approval in a vote of 83-16. The majority of Republicans opposed the bill, with 109 voting no. The border security compromise, tucked into a sweeping, 1,159-page spending bill, would appropriate $1.375bn for 55 miles of new fencing along the border with Mexico, which is far less than the $5.7bn Trump sought for a concrete or steel wall. The bill next goes to the president, who said he would sign it on Friday preventing a second painful government shutdown, but announced he had plans to declare a national emergency as a way of funding his long-promised border wall with Mexico. The House is now voting on the bipartisan bill passed by the Senate that will keep the government open. More to come soon! Today the Senate confirmed William Barr as attorney general, over concerns by Democrats that he will not properly oversee the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s connections to Russia. This afternoon, Matt Schlapp \u2014 who chairs the American Conservative Union and whose wife Mercedes is the White House director of strategic communications \u2014 raised eyebrows with a tweet suggesting there might be merit to those fears. \u201cTomorrow will be the first day that President Trump will have a fully operational confirmed Attorney General,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cLet that sink in. Mueller will be gone soon\u201d. Former Starbucks CEO and current presidential hopeful, Howard Shultz, offered Democrats the chance to get him off the ballot today, saying that he\u2019d abandon his campaign if a centrist is nominated, the Washington Post reports. Shultz hasn\u2019t yet officially announced his bid for 2020, but has been vocal about his plans to run as an independent: Schultz, who made the comments while visiting The Washington Post, has premised his exploration of a presidential campaign on the assumption that Democrats are likely to nominate a candidate that embraces what he calls \u201cfar-left\u201d ideas that will turn off enough moderate voters to open space for an independent candidate. He has paid for internal polling that he says suggest he would be competitive in a three-way race against President Trump and a liberal Democratic candidate such as Senator Kamala Harris, Senator Elizabeth Warren, or Senator Bernie Sanders\u201d. The president has not yet announced details on his plan to declare a national emergency, but according to ABC News the Justice Department warned the move would be blocked temporarily in the courts. The Trump Administration hopes to move forward through appeal, an official told the news network. Lawyers at the White House, the Department of Homeland Security and at the Pentagon have been working for weeks to iron out different options the president would have to obtain funds for his border wall. By declaring a national emergency at the border, the president could potentially free up billions of dollars to begin work on construction of a southern border wall. Much of that money would be pulled from the Department of Defense\u201d. Democrats are preparing to take on the Trump Administration if he moves forward with his national emergency declaration, the Washington Post reports. Representative Jerrold Nadler, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, told the Post today that a joint resolution will be coming soon, that will force Senate Republicans to vote on the president\u2019s divisive and unpopular plan: \u2018This is a gross abuse of presidential power\u2019 Nadler said of the news that Trump would declare a national emergency to try to move money around to fulfill his campaign promise. \u2018This is an attempt to overturn the basic constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. Congress has the power of the purse. It cannot be tolerated\u2019. Should the Senate fail to adopt the resolution, or should Trump veto the text, Nadler said \u2018we\u2019ll probably go to court after that\u2019. House Democrats, anticipating the president\u2019s move, have discussed a potential legal challenge for what they see as executive overreach\u201d. Details around Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration are still scant but the President has called a \u201clid\u201d for the evening, meaning no more news will be released by the White House for now. Puerto Rico\u2019s governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 threatened a lawsuit against the Trump Administration if the president moves forward with a plan to declare a national emergency to get funding for his wall that diverts funding from disaster relief. The president has promised that his plan won\u2019t rely on funds appropriated for disasters. For a better understanding of what will happen if Trump declares a national emergency, here\u2019s an explainer from my colleague Tom McCarthy, answering key questions: In the midst of a busy news day, the White House released its second health assessment on the president showing that he \u201cremains in very good health\u201d even though he has put on a few pounds, the Washington Post reports: Trump, 72, stands 6-foot-3 and weighs 243 pounds, making him overweight, according the memorandum. The president\u2019s weight was reported as 239 pounds last year, and he was advised to watch his diet, exercise more and lose weight. In the past year, doctors increased Trump\u2019s dose of rovusastatin, a drug used to lower the president\u2019s cardiac risk. Trump received the Pneumovax 23 and Shingrix immunizations, Conley wrote\u201d. Though the findings minimized Trump\u2019s weight, the gains pushed the president past the point of overweight and into the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention range for obesity. The president\u2019s BMI was also calculated with his height listed as 6\u20193, a number that was questioned last year during Trump\u2019s first health assessment. Gabrielle Canon here, taking over for Ben Jacobs for the evening. Conservative lawmakers Senator Marco Rubio and Senator Rand Paul have rebuked the President\u2019s plan to sign the spending bill that would keep the government from shutting down again, and then declaring a national emergency to fund his border wall. \u201cWe have a crisis at our southern border, but no crisis justifies violating the Constitution,\u201d Rubio said in a statement, promising he would not \u201csupport using devastated communities in Florida as pawns for some future legislative deal\u201d. Senator Rand Paul responded on Twitter, voicing his opposition for the move. President Donald Trump announced that he would sign a compromise bill funding the government but also that he would declare a national emergency in a effort to build a wall on the United States\u2019s southern border The compromise government funding bill passed the Senate by a margin of 83-16. It is expected to be approved by the House later tonight William Barr was confirmed by the Senate to be Attorney General by a vote of 54-45 Democrats released the criteria for the first two presidential debates of 2020. They will have up to 20 candidates participate in each debate. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have issued a joint statement about President Donald Trump\u2019s planned declaration of a national emergency Declaring a national emergency would be a lawless act, a gross abuse of the power of the presidency and a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that President Trump broke his core promise to have Mexico pay for his wall. \u201cIt is yet another demonstration of President Trump\u2019s naked contempt for the rule of law. This is not an emergency, and the president\u2019s fearmongering doesn\u2019t make it one. He couldn\u2019t convince Mexico, the American people or their elected representatives to pay for his ineffective and expensive wall, so now he\u2019s trying an end-run around Congress in a desperate attempt to put taxpayers on the hook for it. The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities.\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke is heading to Wisconsin for a closed press event in Madison at the University of Wisconsin. Trump ally Lindsay Graham endorses his declaration of a National Emergency The Senate just passed the government funding by a lopsided margin of 83-16. The 16 against were a mix of ardent conservatives and Democrats running for President. Details of President Donald Trump\u2019s physical last week were just released. Trump now weigh 243 pounds, four more than he weighed last year. The DNC has released its criteria for the first two debates. They will have room for up to 20 candidates who meet one of two criteria, getting 1% in three qualifying polls before the debate or raise money from 65,000 unique donors and a minimum of 200 donors per state from 20 different states. Sarah Sanders was just asked by reporters about potential legal challenges to a national emergency declaration. We\u2019re very prepared, but there shouldn\u2019t be [legal challenges]. The president\u2019s doing his job. Congress should do theirs.\u201d A procedural vote to advance the government funding bill just passed in the Senate by a veto proof margin. Nancy Pelosi is keeping her options open on Trump\u2019s planned declaration of a national emergency. The White House has issued a formal statement on the government funding bill and the national emergency declaration \u201cPresident Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action - including a national emergency - to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border. The President is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall, protect the border, and secure our great country.\u201d McConnell interrupted Senator Chuck Grassley to speak on the floor and Grassley was not happy. House majority leader Steny Hoyer just weighed in on the announcement that Trump would declare a national emergency in an interview with MSNBC. I think declaring an a national emergency where there is no national emergency is not good for the president to do and not good precedent for future presidents. A million-dollar Balinese-style temple that will be burned to ground in May was a gathering point for students of Florida\u2019s Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school on Thursday as they remembered their 14 classmates and three teachers killed a year ago today in one of the nation\u2019s deadliest mass shootings. The Temple of Time, an ornate giant wooden palace designed by the California-based artist David Best, and built with the aid of a $1 million grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies, was erected in neighbouring Coral Springs as a temporary memorial for the victims of the Parkland shooting. By early afternoon Thursday, dozens of MSD students and their families had arrived to write messages on the temple\u2019s plywood walls or lay flowers and other momentos. The solemn gathering was one of a number of commemorative events in Parkland and neighbouring cities on the first anniversary of the tragedy. Thousands were expected to attend an interfaith service later in the day at Pine Trails Park, site of the official memorials and a vigils one year ago. In the tradition of many of Best\u2019s other works, including at the notorious Burning Man festivals in Nevada, the Coral Springs temple will be set alight in late May in \u201cthe burn\u201d, which the artist says is \u201ca casting off of the demons of pain grief and sorrow.\u201d \u201cWe couldn\u2019t call it a temple of healing, I don\u2019t have that power,\u201d said Best, who was emotional as he hugged many of the students. \u201cThe process of healing takes a long time.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell just announced on the Senate floor that President Donald Trump will sign the government funding bill but will also immediately declare a national emergency in order to try to build a border wall at the same time. Kamala Harris just picked up another key congressional endorsement. Congresswoman Barbara Lee of California just endorsed Harris\u2019s presidential campaign. Lee, a vocal progressive, is the first member of the Congressional Black Caucus to endorse. Further Lee\u2019s backing will shore up Harris with those on the left of the Democratic Party who have been critical of Harris\u2019s career as a prosecutor. CNN reports that Donald Trump may not sign the bipartisan compromise to keep the government open after all. Conservative critics of the bill have become more vocal in recent days. Without new legislation, the government will shutdown again at 12:00 AM Saturday morning The House of Representatives will be short one member for the near future. Illinois Republican Adam Kinzinger was deployed to the U.S. Mexico border this week. A member of the Air National Guard who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, Kinzinger will miss House votes for the duration of his deployment. The Senate unanimously backed a bill to make lynching a federal crime earlier today. The same bill passed the Senate last year as well but never received a vote in the House. It is expected to pass the lower chamber and reach Donald Trump\u2019s desk this year. Joe Biden met with California Democrat Dianne Feinstein today about a potential presidential bid. Although Biden didn\u2019t commit to a run, Feinstein thinks he will launch his third presidential campaign. Milwaukee is getting a strong push to be the site of the next Democratic National Convention from elected officials across the Midwest. Not just Wisconsin politicians but elected officials and business leaders are pushing for Milwaukee to host the convention. Hillary Clinton notoriously did not visit Wisconsin during the 2016 general election before losing the Badger State to Donald Trump in November. The city is one of three finalists for the 2020 convention along with Houston and Miami Beach. Laura Ingraham, a prominent conservative media figure and primetime host on Fox News is now urging Trump to veto the government funding deal. The vote on William Barr\u2019s nomination has finally finished. Three Democrats ended up voting for him, including Doug Jones from Alabama, who faces a tough re-election bid in 2020. Funeral services were held in Washington today for John Dingell, the longest serving Congressman in American history. The Michigan Democrat spent nearly sixty years in the House of Representatives. Both former President Bill Clinton and former Speaker John Boehner spoke at the services. The White House has issued a statement bashing Andrew McCabe. This follows Trump\u2019s tweets this morning. The vote is still open in the Senate. However, Trump\u2019s nominee to be attorney general has received enough votes so far to be confirmed. So far, only two senators have broken party lines. Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky voted against Barr\u2019s confirmation and Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted for it. There\u2019s reporting that Clarence Thomas is mulling retirement from the supreme court. The 70-year-old has spent nearly 30 years on the court and is the longest serving current justice. If he retires before 2020, a replacement would be nominated by Donald Trump and only require a simple majority in the GOP-controlled Senate. Presidential candidates are now hitting the \u201csoup supper\u201d circuit in Iowa and showing up at local county Democratic party fundraisers. As Iowa Starting Line reports: The Monroe County Democrats will hear from Amy Klobuchar, John Delaney and Eric Swalwell this Sunday in Albia at their annual Spaghetti Supper fundraiser. It\u2019s one of the Minnesota senator\u2019s first events in Iowa since her campaign announcement last weekend. Swalwell is expected to kick off his presidential bid sometime soon. Just up the road a few hours before that, the Marion County Democrats have Klobuchar and Delaney at their Presidents Day Soup Lunch in Knoxville. The following weekend the Story County Democrats welcome a lineup of Kamala Harris, Juli\u00e1n Castro and John Hickenlooper at their annual Soup Supper fundraiser in Ames. After deleting his mysterious tweet, Trump now has a fuller tweet about the funding bill that still leaves his intentions cryptic. The President has a mysterious tweet about the funding bill. Is it an omen or just a typo? Four newly-elected left wing members of Congress say they will vote against the compromise to keep the government open because it increases funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Democrats are increasingly breaking ranks on procedural votes in the House of Representative. In particular, newly elected moderate freshmen are voting with Republicans to avoid political attacks. Politico reports: House Democrats have repeatedly faced surprise Republican floor attacks since taking control of the chamber, part of a bid by the GOP to target their most vulnerable members and fracture the party. Just six weeks in, the GOP effort has been an astonishing success \u2013 dividing Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her top deputies and pitting members of the freshmen class against each other. At issue is a wonky procedural tactic that Republicans have weaponized to split Democrats on a range of thorny issues, from sexual abuse to anti-terrorism funding. Roughly two dozen Democrats have so far bucked their party and sided with Republicans on the votes, which offer the House minority one last chance to shape legislation on the floor. Speaking to reporters in Warsaw, Poland, Vice-President Mike Pence said Trump is \u201cnot happy\u201d with the government funding deal expected to be approved by Congress today. The president and I have spoken several times during the course of the trip. I know the president is still evaluating the bill that the conference committee has produced. I think he\u2019s been very clear that he\u2019s not happy with it. Seeing less than $1.4bn in border wall funding I know is a disappointment to the president but he\u2019s considering the bill. There\u2019s $23bn in border security funding including many of the priorities that we requested to address what is a real crisis on our southern border and I know the president is considering that as well as other authority he has as president of the United States to address what is a very real humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border so I think the president is evaluating what\u2019s in the bill. He\u2019s also evaluating the authority that he has and I know he\u2019ll be making a decision before the deadline this Friday. A Maryland prosecutor has charged a college student for illegal wiretapping because he streamed a video of a meeting with a congressional staffer on Facebook Live. The college student was lobbying Republican Andy Harris to support marijuana legalization and live streamed a meeting on the topic with one of Harris\u2019s staffers. The staffer did not consent. Support for stricter gun laws has dropped substantially since the immediate aftermath of the Parkland shooting one year ago today, according to a new poll. A slim majority, 51%, said in the Marist Poll that laws covering the sale of firearms should be stricter. That\u2019s down from 71% who backed that view shortly after the shooting. Gun control support grows a bit when the question is asked differently: 59% said their first reaction when hearing about a mass shooting is that the country needs stricter gun laws. That beats out the 25% whose first thought is that more people need to carry a gun. Forty-two percent of Americans, down from 52% last April, think stricter gun legislation should be an immediate priority for Congress Senator Elizabeth Warren tells CNN it was legitimate for officials to consider using the 25th amendment to remove Donald Trump from office. Former FBI acting director Andrew McCabe described the talks in a new interview with 60 Minutes. A lot of people want to work for Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. There were about 5,500 applicants for jobs in her Congressional office, the Washington Post reports. The Post profiles two of the staffers who won spots, Ariel Eckblad, 31, the congresswoman\u2019s legislative director, and Dan Riffle, 37, a legislative assistant. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer says \u201cbring it on\u201d to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s plan to bring up the Green New Deal for a vote on the Senate floor. Many taxpayers find themselves getting smaller refunds this year under the GOP tax bill, the Boston Globe reports. The average 2018 refund so far is 8% smaller than last year, according to the IRS - $1,865 compared with $2,035. Most taxpayers are paying less in income taxes overall after the legislation lowered rates. But for many that meant less money withheld from their paychecks throughout the year, as well as a smaller paycheck. Some taxpayers even found themselves owing money for the first time and complained about it online with the hashtag #trumptaxscam. Lynne Patton, the top Housing and Urban Development official in New York and a former event planner for the Trump family, channeled Donald Trump\u2019s comments about \u201cshithole countries\u201d in describing conditions in public housing apartments, NY1 reports. Patton is spending a month living in the New York City Housing Authority to highlight troubles at the housing developments, which are about to get a federal monitor. Several New York members of Congress are facing potential primary challenges after Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez showed it is possible to knock off an entrenched incumbent there. Among the possible primary contests, the New York Times reports: Some progressives are pushing to unseat Representative Eliot Engel, the foreign relations committee chair who represents the Bronx and Westchester. Sean McElwee, a co-founder of the progressive thinktank Data for Progress, called finding a challenger a \u201ctop priority\u201d. Andom Ghebreghiorgis, a Mount Vernon educator, is considering running, he told the Times. Representative Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the House judiciary committee, could face a challenge from Lindsey Boylan, a former economic development adviser to New York governor Andrew Cuomo. Bronx city councilman Ritchie Torres may run against Representative Jose Serrano. Brooklyn representative. Yvette Clarke is likely to face a rematch against Adem Bunkeddeko, who ran against her in a close race last year. Lawmakers are asking the homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, to punish an assistant secretary in her department who has refused to cooperate with an inspector general\u2019s probe. Three Democrats \u2013 House foreign affairs chairman Eliot Engel, House oversight chairman Elijah Cummings, and Senate foreign relations ranking member Bob Menendez \u2013 asked for formal discipline against Christine Ciccone, the assistant secretary for legislative affairs, Politico reported. They released a memo from DHS\u2019s inspector general, which says that the inspector general at the State Department has been attempting to interview Ciccone, but she has refused. The inspector general recommends disciplinary action against her. The investigation concerns politically motivated retaliation against state department employees when Ciccone was deputy chief of staff there. \u201cIt is outrageous that a senior Department of Homeland Security official has not complied with requests of the inspectors general of the Departments of State and Homeland Security,\u201d the three lawmakers said, according to Politico. \u201cTargeting of career government employees at the state department, US Agency for International Development or any federal agency is unacceptable, and it is imperative that this kind of behavior not be tolerated.\u201d The third ranking Democrat in the House came to the defense of Rep. Ilhan Omar, who has faced accusations of anti-semitism. \u201cI think she\u2019s an incredible young lady who has a tremendous future in politics,\u201d Rep. James Clyburn, the House majority whip, said on CNN\u2019s New Day. He urged his colleagues to \u201cput this behind us.\u201d The Senate is expected to vote Thursday on confirming Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, William Barr. The vote is expected to be mostly along party lines, according to CNN. By contrast, Barr was unanimously confirmed to serve as attorney general under President George HW Bush. In what may not be a vote of confidence in Trump\u2019s support for the bipartisan deal to avoid a government shutdown, Chuck Grassley, the most senior Republican in the chamber, has asked the Senate to pray that he signs the legislation. In his interview with CBS News\u2019s Scott Pelley, former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe said he began an obstruction of justice investigation of Trump the day after the Comey firing and took steps to ensure that the Russia probe could not be shutdown. I think the next day, I met with the team investigating the Russia cases. And I asked the team to go back and conduct an assessment to determine where are we with these efforts and what steps do we need to take going forward. I was very concerned that I was able to put the Russia case on absolutely solid ground in an indelible fashion that were I removed quickly and reassigned or fired that the case could not be closed or vanish in the night without a trace. I wanted to make sure that our case was on solid ground. And if somebody came in behind me and closed it and tried to walk away from it, they would not be able to do that without creating a record of why they\u2019d made that decision. McCabe also said there were meetings at the Justice Department about whether the 25th Amendment could be invoked to remove Trump. The constitutional provision which ratified in 1967, allows the vice president to take over temporarily as acting president if he and a majority of cabinet officers declare that the President \u201cunable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.\u201d One of the more unique figures in American politics passed away on Tuesday. Lyndon LaRouche, a perennial presidential candidate, conspiracy theorist and convicted felon died at the age of 96. LaRouche, who famously claimed that Queen Elizabeth II was a drug trafficker, built a cult of personality based out of a Northern Virginia compound. His influence peaked in the 1980s before he was convicted of mail fraud and spent seven years in federal prison. President Donald Trump has responded on Twitter to former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe. In excerpts of an interview with CBS that were released this morning, McCabe said Justice Department officials discussed invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office and began investigating Trump himself for obstruction of justice after the May 2017 firing of FBI Director Jim Comey. Former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper is criticizing YouTube on the campaign trail. Hickenlooper who is in New Hampshire and considered likely to pursue a presidential bid, is going after the platform for promoting extreme content. The Democratic National Committee is expected to unveil its plans for the first two primary debates of 2020 later this week. Tom Perez, the chair of the DNC, told the AP \u201che plans to include a grassroots fundraising metric as part of the qualifying threshold.\u201d One Democratic presidential candidate is going out of his way to bash the proposed Green New Deal resolution in Congress, comparing to Trump\u2019s pledge for Mexico to pay for a border wall. In a statement, former Congressman John Delaney of Maryland said: First of all, climate change is real and we need to take aggressive action to counter its effects. If we do nothing, it\u2019s going to hurt our environment, it\u2019s going to hurt our economy, it\u2019s going to hurt agriculture, and it\u2019s going to hurt our national security. And while I absolutely applaud all the enthusiasm behind the Green New Deal, because we need that energy to fight climate change, the Green New Deal as it has been proposed is about as realistic as Trump saying that Mexico is going to pay for the wall. Mark Kelly, the former astronaut running for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in Arizona, has raised over $1 million since announcing his candidacy on Tuesday. Kelly had raised $1.1 million by the end of the day Wednesday, a figure more comparable to presidential campaigns rather than statewide campaigns. The Democrat, who is married to former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, is hoping to face appointed incumbent Martha McSally in a November 2020 special election for the Senate seat vacated by John McCain\u2019s death. Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for Stormy Daniels who became a political celebrity in 2018, gave up financial control of his law firm late Wednesday. Avenatti had faced allegations of trying to hide millions of dollars from a former law partner who had won a $10 million judgment against the firm. He settled the allegations by putting all the assets of the firm, Eagan Avenatti under the control of a court appointed receiver. It marks another chapter in the fall from grace of Avenatti who once even considered a presidential bid. Former Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke met with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer to discuss another bid for the U.S. Senate last week. O\u2019Rourke, who narrowly lost a Senate race to incumbent Ted Cruz in 2018, is being recruited to run against three-term incumbent John Cornyn in 2020. The Texas Democrat is also mulling a presidential bid. Good morning. Congress is poised to strike a bipartisan deal to avoid another government shutdown and fund the government through September, a federal judge ruled Paul Manafort lied to prosecutors and that Robert Mueller no longer has to honor their plea deal, and former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe said that he ordered an investigation of Donald Trump after the 2017 firing of Jim Comey. It\u2019s Thursday in American politics.",

I was given [a] full name, birthday, email and physical address for this other person.\u201d Matthew Glover also experienced problems with sim card activation. \u201cSo apparently if you activate a new prepaid sim card with Optus at the exact same time as 17 other people all their activation emails get sent to you and you still don\u2019t get to activate your own damn sim,\u201d he said. Glover expressed frustration that his case had been shuffled around to four different call centre staff and he had to explain the problem each time. Another customer named Cameron Worts reported problems logging into the \u201cmy account\u201d section of the website and seeing other people\u2019s personal details \u201cThis is very concerning,\u201d he said. Some customers were reporting their accounts were being logged on as \u201cVladamir\u201d or \u201cSarah.\u201d The telco said it was aware some customers reported seeing incorrect information when activating their prepaid service, and when logging into the \u201cmy account\u201d section to pay their bills. \u201cWe apologise to any customer who may have experienced this issue and will be contacting any customer who may have been impacted,\u201d a spokeswoman said. The company said it was working with \u201cthird party vendors to identify the cause of yesterday\u2019s issue\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Barnaby Joyce and two other Nationals MPs have backed measures to improve small businesses\u2019 access to justice, in a move which may force Scott Morrison to overturn government policy or risk a second lower house defeat on a substantive bill. In comments to Guardian Australia Joyce, Keith Pitt and Andrew Broad all expressed in-principle support for measures designed to help in court cases of farmers and suppliers taking on big business like Coles and Woolworths for alleged misuse of market power. On Thursday night, Labor and the crossbench combined in the Senate to pass amendments to an obscure government treasury bill over Liberal objections, after Nationals senator John Williams signalled they had support from the junior Coalition partner. Under the amended bill, small businesses will be able to apply in court before launching major legal action to escape paying costs even if they lose a competition law case against larger rivals. The Treasury Laws Amendment (2018 Measures No5) bill now looms as a time-bomb for the Morrison government when parliament returns on Monday, likely to cause a loss in the House of Representatives as occurred on Wednesday with the medevac bill unless the government supports the bill with Labor\u2019s amendments. Joyce told Guardian Australia he would not \u201ctelegraph [his] punches\u201d on how he will vote but the \u201cwhole raison d\u2019etre of the Nationals is to support small business\u201d. \u201cOne of the reasons we\u2019re so strong in our support of general divestiture powers in the power market is because we hate to see small businesses walked on by massive businesses with market power that means everything is stacked their way,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything we can do to assist small business get a more just market we would support \u2013 I would support \u2013 I\u2019m not leader anymore, I can\u2019t say what others would do.\u201d Joyce said court orders exempting small businesses from paying their opponents\u2019 legal costs were \u201cthe only way they won\u2019t live in fear\u201d of adverse costs orders. \u201cAt the moment they don\u2019t take on unfairness in a case not because they don\u2019t think they have a case, they worry they can\u2019t pay for the case if they lose.\u201d Pitt said he was supportive of measures to allow small business to take on cases without penalty but had not read Labor\u2019s amendment and had an \u201copen mind\u201d how to achieve that outcome. \u201cSmall business is significantly disadvantaged when you have very large companies that come do some practices that shouldn\u2019t be allowed, drive them out of business, and they don\u2019t have resources to take them on in court processes,\u201d he said. Asked if he would support the measures despite Liberal opposition, Pitt replied: \u201cThe history of the last two parliaments is that any number of amendments pass that are agreed on by the major parties.\u201d Broad said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if it will get on next week\u2019s debate but anything that stops Coles doing the wrong thing by Australian farmers would gain support by myself and other Nationals.\u201d The Coalition previously voted against the measure in a 2017 private senators bill and the Liberals were set to do so last night in the Senate until finance minister Mathias Cormann intervened, accepting the government didn\u2019t have the numbers. Labor\u2019s shadow assistant treasurer, Andrew Leigh, said Cormann had been forced to \u201ccapitulate [and] call off the vote\u201d when he \u201crealised the Nationals might cross the floor\u201d. \u201cNow that the amended bill passed the Senate, it will return to the House of Representatives, where Scott Morrison has the chance to perform a last-minute backflip, and finally support small business and competitive markets,\u201d Leigh said. The Nationals are also pushing for the big stick legislation, shelved by the government on Thursday, to come back to parliament. Joyce said it should come back to parliament \u201cas soon as possible\u201d and the government should at least have left it on the notice paper to signal it was committed to giving courts power to break up energy companies who abuse market power. The Liberals and Nationals frequently clash on questions of competition law, particularly measures to tackle the market power of banks, big energy companies and Australia\u2019s grocery duopoly. Malcolm Turnbull agreed to introduce the effects test as part of the Coalition deal with the Nationals. In late 2017 an insurrection within the Coalition by the Nationals \u2013 many of whom threatened to support a Labor and Greens push for a parliamentary inquiry \u2013 forced the Turnbull government to call a banking royal commission.",

There is no official figure on honour killings in India, but <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/More-than-1000-honour-killings-in-India-every-year-Experts/articleshow/6127338.cms\">a study has estimated</a> at least 1,000 people are murdered by their families each year for pursuing the kinds of romantic relationships that are a staple of Bollywood blockbusters but off-limits to most young Indians.</p> <p>In response Love Commandos opened new shelters. It created a network of safe-houses across India. Some days its staff of fewer than 10 people would receive more than 300 calls \u2013 including regular death threats. \u201cIndia is a country of killers of love,\u201d Sachdev told 2016 documentary.</p> <h2><strong>The charity that \u2018made things worse\u2019</strong></h2> <p>One of those calls for help was from Rajesh*, 27, who learned about Love Commandos from a YouTube video in November. His situation was desperate. Six months earlier he had secretly become engaged to Amrit*, a woman from Maharashtra he had been chatting with on Facebook for years.</p> <p>Amrit is Brahmin, the \u201chighest\u201d caste in India\u2019s intricate social hierarchy, and has strict parents. \u201cThey have orthodox thinking,\u201d she says. \u201cThey think girls should not go outside, they should not wear jeans.\u201d</p> <p>Marrying a boy from a \u201clower\u201d caste such as Rajesh was out of the question. \u201cWe were afraid of \u2018honour killing\u2019,\u201d Rajesh says, nodding in Amrit\u2019s direction. \u201cHer uncle has guns.\u201d</p> <p>Rajesh saw Love Commandos as the solution. \u201cUnfortunately it made things worse,\u201d he says.</p> <p>According to the complaint registered with police, shortly after Rajesh and Amrit arrived at the shelter on 20 December, Sachdev asked the couple to hand over 40,000 rupees (\u00a3432) to cover the expenses of their marriage and lodging.</p> <p>He asked for more money in the subsequent days. When Rajesh refused, staff at the shelter threatened to send them back to their families, according to the complaint.</p> <p>\u201cWe were forced to clean the shelter and take dogs for walks, and when [Rajesh] and I tried to leave the shelter they forcibly blocked our way,\u201d Amrit told police.</p> <p>She resolved to raise an alarm. Late in January, Amrit was taken to the Delhi Commission for Women to fill out paperwork about her marriage.</p> <p>When Sachdev was called to a meeting, leaving Amrit behind, she saw her opportunity. She found a commission staff member, reported her allegations and rushed back to the lobby.</p> <p>\u201cWhen [Sachdev] came back, he asked me: \u2018Did you say anything?\u2019\u201d Amrit claims. \u201cI said no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I had done everything,\u201d she adds, grinning.</p> <p>The following day, DCW officers raided the Love Commandos shelter. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/31/sanjoy-sachdev-founder-india-love-commandos-ngo-held-over-extortion-claims-shelter-couples-honour-killings\">Sachdev\u2019s arrest was international news</a>.</p> <p>Couples who have been assisted by Love Commandos are struggling to process the allegations against the organisation. \u201cNobody ever asked me for any money,\u201d says Vijay Kumar, who was staying at the shelter until two days before Sachdev\u2019s arrest. \u201cWhatever I paid, I paid voluntarily to cover the expenses for my marriage.\u201d</p> <p>Kumar, 22, is now in hiding with his wife in a neighbouring state. Her family is looking for the pair. Without Sachdev, they would never have been able to marry, Kumar says. \u201cWhatever life I have now is a gift from him.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Couples trapped in \u2018what might feel like a prison\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Lyons, the filmmaker, says there was occasionally resentment between Sachdev and the couples he sheltered. She remembers the shock on the faces of some of the new arrivals when they saw the humble conditions inside Love Commandos shelters. As well as sheltering couples, the organisation also tried to teach them life skills such as cooking and cleaning.</p> <p>Some bristled at being made to do these chores; others would fight against attempts to stop them from spending too much time on the balconies or walking the streets, to avoid the safe houses being compromised. A ban on sex inside the cramped shelter often created tension.</p> <p>\u201c[The couples] want to be free and they find themselves in what might feel like a prison,\u201d Lyons says. \u201cBut it\u2019s for their own good and they can\u2019t seem to think long term.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere were issues like you have in a family,\u201d she adds. \u201cYoung people fight back against their parents because they want more freedom.

      "bodyText": "It was a world-famous charity dedicated to rescuing star-crossed Indian lovers. For the past nine years, using a network of secret safe-houses across India, Love Commandos sheltered thousands of young people seeking to marry outside their caste, religion or clan \u2013 and who feared their families might kill them for it. Sanjoy Sachdev, the organisation\u2019s chairman, became one of India\u2019s most celebrated activists. Bollywood star Aamir Khan interviewed him on television. International clothing brand Bjorn Borg raised money for his group. Filmmakers and journalists found the craggy, chain-smoking activist who could quote Robert Frost irresistible. Now Indian police are asking: was he a fraud? Sachdev, 58, was arrested at the Love Commandos headquarters in Delhi on 31 January on suspicion of extorting money from at least one young couple in his care, confining them in the building and threatening to send them back to their families if they refused to pay. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let us go out, even to the balconies,\u201d the woman told the Guardian. \u201cWe had to get sunlight from a small window in the bathroom.\u201d Since the arrest, six more couples have come forward with complaints about Love Commandos, including one now living in the UK, according to the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW). Sachdev denies the allegations. \u201cThe charges as such are fake and we will be pleading so in any trial,\u201d says his lawyer Vikrant Choudhary. Those who followed and promoted Love Commandos for nearly a decade are shocked and confused. \u201cIn 10 years they have saved thousands of couples,\u201d says Miriam Lyons, a British director who filmed the organisation on and off for five years. \u201cI am in admiration for their work. It is extraordinary what they do.\u201d Love Commandos was founded in 2010, the same year a spate of so-called \u201chonour killings\u201d provoked an outcry in the Indian capital. Sachdev and his associates had already gained a minor profile for their work as volunteer bodyguards for couples who were being attacked by Hindu fanatics for celebrating Valentine\u2019s Day. As Love Commandos\u2019 fame grew, so did the number of young people seeking help. There is no official figure on honour killings in India, but a study has estimated at least 1,000 people are murdered by their families each year for pursuing the kinds of romantic relationships that are a staple of Bollywood blockbusters but off-limits to most young Indians. In response Love Commandos opened new shelters. It created a network of safe-houses across India. Some days its staff of fewer than 10 people would receive more than 300 calls \u2013 including regular death threats. \u201cIndia is a country of killers of love,\u201d Sachdev told 2016 documentary. The charity that \u2018made things worse\u2019 One of those calls for help was from Rajesh*, 27, who learned about Love Commandos from a YouTube video in November. His situation was desperate. Six months earlier he had secretly become engaged to Amrit*, a woman from Maharashtra he had been chatting with on Facebook for years. Amrit is Brahmin, the \u201chighest\u201d caste in India\u2019s intricate social hierarchy, and has strict parents. \u201cThey have orthodox thinking,\u201d she says. \u201cThey think girls should not go outside, they should not wear jeans.\u201d Marrying a boy from a \u201clower\u201d caste such as Rajesh was out of the question. \u201cWe were afraid of \u2018honour killing\u2019,\u201d Rajesh says, nodding in Amrit\u2019s direction. \u201cHer uncle has guns.\u201d Rajesh saw Love Commandos as the solution. \u201cUnfortunately it made things worse,\u201d he says. According to the complaint registered with police, shortly after Rajesh and Amrit arrived at the shelter on 20 December, Sachdev asked the couple to hand over 40,000 rupees (\u00a3432) to cover the expenses of their marriage and lodging. He asked for more money in the subsequent days. When Rajesh refused, staff at the shelter threatened to send them back to their families, according to the complaint. \u201cWe were forced to clean the shelter and take dogs for walks, and when [Rajesh] and I tried to leave the shelter they forcibly blocked our way,\u201d Amrit told police. She resolved to raise an alarm. Late in January, Amrit was taken to the Delhi Commission for Women to fill out paperwork about her marriage. When Sachdev was called to a meeting, leaving Amrit behind, she saw her opportunity. She found a commission staff member, reported her allegations and rushed back to the lobby. \u201cWhen [Sachdev] came back, he asked me: \u2018Did you say anything?\u2019\u201d Amrit claims. \u201cI said no.\u201d \u201cBut I had done everything,\u201d she adds, grinning. The following day, DCW officers raided the Love Commandos shelter. Sachdev\u2019s arrest was international news. Couples who have been assisted by Love Commandos are struggling to process the allegations against the organisation. \u201cNobody ever asked me for any money,\u201d says Vijay Kumar, who was staying at the shelter until two days before Sachdev\u2019s arrest. \u201cWhatever I paid, I paid voluntarily to cover the expenses for my marriage.\u201d Kumar, 22, is now in hiding with his wife in a neighbouring state. Her family is looking for the pair. Without Sachdev, they would never have been able to marry, Kumar says. \u201cWhatever life I have now is a gift from him.\u201d Couples trapped in \u2018what might feel like a prison\u2019 Lyons, the filmmaker, says there was occasionally resentment between Sachdev and the couples he sheltered. She remembers the shock on the faces of some of the new arrivals when they saw the humble conditions inside Love Commandos shelters. As well as sheltering couples, the organisation also tried to teach them life skills such as cooking and cleaning. Some bristled at being made to do these chores; others would fight against attempts to stop them from spending too much time on the balconies or walking the streets, to avoid the safe houses being compromised. A ban on sex inside the cramped shelter often created tension. \u201c[The couples] want to be free and they find themselves in what might feel like a prison,\u201d Lyons says. \u201cBut it\u2019s for their own good and they can\u2019t seem to think long term.\u201d \u201cThere were issues like you have in a family,\u201d she adds. \u201cYoung people fight back against their parents because they want more freedom. And parents say, this is for your own good.\u201d Sachdev\u2019s lawyer says his client is the victim of a conspiracy. \u201cThere is a vendetta going on,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are certain NGOs in the locality who are against the organisation.\u201d Love Commandos had just become registered as a charity, but its existence was still precarious. Sachdev frankly told the BBC in 2012: \u201cWe need money. We are broke. Our friends are broke. I\u2019m not sure how long we can sustain this.\u201d The pressure had grown in the past year. The organisation had started closing shelters, Choudhary said. By January, it was running just one. \u201cThey were facing a money crunch,\u201d Choudhary says. \u201cThe organisation was not able to finance itself.\u201d Sachdev has been remanded in custody while police investigate the allegations against him. Police are looking for other senior leaders from the organisation. The eight couples who were staying in the Love Commandos shelter, including Rajesh and Amrit, are stranded. They have been placed in temporary safe houses by Delhi authorities. But India has no shelter system for couples fleeing their parents. \u201cIt worries us,\u201d Rajesh said. Now, couples who ring the Love Commandos hotline get a new answer: the number is switched off or unavailable. *Names have been changed",

But the agency in charge of My Health Record wants to charge $14,000 to release details on the files through Australia\u2019s freedom of information regime. Guardian Australia revealed last month that a technical problem with the My Health Record system had hampered attempts by some doctors to upload clinical information about their patients to the system. According to a leaked briefing, some doctors in clinics using older IT systems were left oblivious to the problem, leading them to believe patient information had been properly updated when it hadn\u2019t.

      "bodyText": "Israel\u2019s deputy health minister has been placed under investigation on suspicion of obstructing the extradition of Malka Leifer to Australia to face child sex abuse charges. Police confirmed that Ya\u2019acov Litzman was questioned on 14 February over suspected ethics violations without elaborating on the nature of the charges. However, Israeli media reported that he had attempted to falsify psychiatric evaluations that would deem Leifer unfit to face trial in Australia. The interrogation follows an investigation started several months ago by the Israeli police fraud investigation unit. An extradition case is ongoing in Israel as expert psychiatrists present to the Jerusalem district court their various examinations of Leifer\u2019s mental stability. Past students of Adass Israel school in Melbourne, who accuse Leifer of abusing them, are fighting to have her returned to Australia on 74 charges of child sex abuse, including rape. Dassi Erlich, one of the women Leifer allegedly abused at the ultra-orthodox school, along with Jewish NGOs Kol V\u2019Oz and Jewish Community Watch, believe Litzman has long been trying to interfere with the case. Erlich told AAP she remembered meeting Litzman last year in the Israeli parliament. \u201cHe did not seem to want to talk to us until [he was] repeatedly asked to have a word,\u201d Erlich said. \u201cHe looked us in the eye and said - \u2018I do not support extradition, and I will not, BUT I will not intervene.\u2019\u201d Manny Waks, cheif executive of Kol V\u2019Oz, said his organisation had expected interference in the Leifer case. \u201cThese serious allegations against Israel\u2019s deputy health minister, Rabbi Ya\u2019acov Litzman, confirms the ongoing suspicion many have regarding this case,\u201d Waks stated. Israeli ministers and Jerusalem\u2019s deputy mayor have called for Litzman to step down from office if Leifer escapes extradition and the allegations that he helpedto obtain false psychiatric papers are found to be true. Erlich said the news of Litzman\u2019s possible involvement in the case was a \u201chuge shock\u201d. \u201cAs the health minister he has a responsibility to be unbiased and fair in all his medical decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe feel he should indeed step down and be fully investigated.\u201d Israel\u2019s state prosecution service said Leifer was feigning mental illness to dodge extradition. The deputy health minister\u2019s office released a statement denying any wrongdoing, continuing to say Litzman was cooperating fully with police. \u201cLitzman is confident of his innocence, and will continue to give assistance to every request which reaches his office, in accordance with the laws and relevant regulations,\u201d the statement read. Leifer flew to Israel 2008 but was arrested there in February 2018 over allegations of child sexual abuse linked to her time as head of the school in the 2000s.",

It has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/23/prisons-england-wales-christmas-cards-glitter-banned-drugs-epidemic\">smuggled into prisons </a>sprayed on children\u2019s drawings and letters.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/blitz-on-drugs-in-prison-underway\">government has said</a> one of the main factors fuelling the violence in prisons was drug use. Asked on Thursday why the use of drugs in prison had escalated, Stewart said: \u201cThe prison estate, which had had problems with drugs in the early 90s, basically thought it had cracked that problem by the early 2000s, and it had \u2013 it had cracked the problem with heroin and cocaine and largely with cannabis.</p> <p>\u201cBut from around 2012 it saw a sudden spike in these new type of drugs, such as spice, and it caught it off balance. Our success against heroin and cocaine meant that we did not have procedures set up to deal with people impregnating mail with spice, for example.\u201d</p> <p>He said that, unlike other drugs previously used, new psychoactive substances provoked violent and aggressive behaviour. \u201cHeroin addiction is terrible,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cBut heroin addiction doesn\u2019t lead prisoners to suddenly assault prison officers.</p> <p>\u201cSo I think we have been playing catch-up. We\u2019ve been playing catch-up with the drugs and we\u2019ve been playing catch-up with the technology.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/31/prison-figures-reveal-rise-in-deaths-assaults-and-self-harm\">Recent figures from the Ministry of Justice</a> showed a record number of prisoner-on-prisoner assaults in the year to September, increasing 18% year on year to 24,138. There were 10,085 assaults on staff in the period, up 29%. Deaths in prison also jumped 10% to 325.</p> <p>Stewart said: \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to make it much more difficult to get drugs into prison. When I began this job, occasionally people in the NGO community would say to me, there\u2019s no point doing this because people will always find another way of getting drugs into prisons. I don\u2019t agree. There are basically only two ways of getting drugs into prison. Walk it through the gate or get it over the fence.\u201d</p> <p>As part of the 10 Prisons Project, a pilot which will be further rolled out if it is deemed a success at the end of the year, Stewart announced the creation of standards coaching teams \u2013 groups of prison officers who will work on rotation to support new recruits and ensure good practice is delivered consistently across the jails.</p> <p>The 10 prisons in the project are HMP Hull, Humber, Leeds, Lindholme, Moorland, Wealstun, Nottingham, Ranby, Isis and Wormwood Scrubs. Stewart has agreed the prisons would need to see a decline in assaults of around 10% to 25% in order for him to stay in his job.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The prisons system was unprepared for the arrival of new psychoactive drugs like spice and has been playing \u201ccatch-up\u201d ever since, the prisons minister Rory Stewart has said. Speaking half a year after vowing to resign if violence at 10 of the worst prisons did not fall, he said governors had told him significant progress had been made, though official data will not be available until April. The \u00a310m \u201c10 prisons project\u201d has seen, among other measures, an increase in the number of sniffer dogs, the installation of x-ray body scanners so people can be checked for drugs concealed in their bodies, and scanners installed that can detect invisible traces of drugs. Spice, the most widely used psychoactive substance, is a liquid that can be sprayed on paper, which is then ripped up and added to a joint. It has been smuggled into prisons sprayed on children\u2019s drawings and letters. The government has said one of the main factors fuelling the violence in prisons was drug use. Asked on Thursday why the use of drugs in prison had escalated, Stewart said: \u201cThe prison estate, which had had problems with drugs in the early 90s, basically thought it had cracked that problem by the early 2000s, and it had \u2013 it had cracked the problem with heroin and cocaine and largely with cannabis. \u201cBut from around 2012 it saw a sudden spike in these new type of drugs, such as spice, and it caught it off balance. Our success against heroin and cocaine meant that we did not have procedures set up to deal with people impregnating mail with spice, for example.\u201d He said that, unlike other drugs previously used, new psychoactive substances provoked violent and aggressive behaviour. \u201cHeroin addiction is terrible,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cBut heroin addiction doesn\u2019t lead prisoners to suddenly assault prison officers. \u201cSo I think we have been playing catch-up. We\u2019ve been playing catch-up with the drugs and we\u2019ve been playing catch-up with the technology.\u201d Recent figures from the Ministry of Justice showed a record number of prisoner-on-prisoner assaults in the year to September, increasing 18% year on year to 24,138. There were 10,085 assaults on staff in the period, up 29%. Deaths in prison also jumped 10% to 325. Stewart said: \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to make it much more difficult to get drugs into prison. When I began this job, occasionally people in the NGO community would say to me, there\u2019s no point doing this because people will always find another way of getting drugs into prisons. I don\u2019t agree. There are basically only two ways of getting drugs into prison. Walk it through the gate or get it over the fence.\u201d As part of the 10 Prisons Project, a pilot which will be further rolled out if it is deemed a success at the end of the year, Stewart announced the creation of standards coaching teams \u2013 groups of prison officers who will work on rotation to support new recruits and ensure good practice is delivered consistently across the jails. The 10 prisons in the project are HMP Hull, Humber, Leeds, Lindholme, Moorland, Wealstun, Nottingham, Ranby, Isis and Wormwood Scrubs. Stewart has agreed the prisons would need to see a decline in assaults of around 10% to 25% in order for him to stay in his job.",

      "body": "<h2>1) Fixtures and injuries leave Solskj\u00e6r pensive before Chelsea trip</h2> <p>Manchester United have lost five times to Chelsea in the FA Cup and the last of United\u2019s eight Cup victories over the Blues came almost exactly two decades ago, in the 1999 quarter-finals, when Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r was in the team. Within the next month Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side will play key games against Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Arsenal away from home and against Liverpool at Old Trafford, with the period ending with either a home match with Manchester City in the league, an FA Cup quarter-final or a few days off, depending on results here and at Newport County this weekend. By its end we will know if the Solskjaer Bounce was just a temporary elevation or whether the genial Norwegian has successfully coaxed this previously pedestrian team into taking flight. The first match of the run, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/12/manchester-united-psg-champions-league-match-report\">against PSG</a>, brought something of a reality check and also a couple of unwelcome injuries, with Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial both limping off, which may force Solskjaer into some fixture prioritisation. It will be interesting to see where this one ranks, given United\u2019s chances of silverware this season almost certainly hinge on it. <strong>SB</strong></p> <h2><strong>2) Newport can still make most of home comforts</strong></h2> <p>Quite what Manchester City\u2019s match-day squad will make of Rodney Parade when they step off their coach and make the long walk towards the away dressing-room before their match against Newport County is anyone\u2019s guess, but we can only hope their reaction is captured on camera. Despite their lowly League Two status, Newport caused Tottenham <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/27/newport-county-tottenham-hotspur-fa-cup-match-report\">all sorts of problems</a> last season and have already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/06/newport-county-leicester-city-fa-cup-match-report\">beaten Leicester</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/05/newport-county-middlesbrough-fa-cup-fourth-round-replay-match-report\">Middlesbrough</a> in Wales this time around. Indeed, their replay win over the team from Teesside could scarcely have been more comfortable. Tony Pulis\u2019s side looked beaten before kick-off, clearly nonplussed by both the atrocious weather conditions and the notion of having to muddy their spats in the quagmire of a provincial rugby stadium that holds less than 10,000 people. The superstars of City will need to be vigilant in the face of potential humiliation. Should the unthinkable happen, the laughter from Rodney Parade, Pillgwenlly and Lliswerry would echo around the world. <strong>BG</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"081f6ad7c9bebd84907aef7f15ab2e5c005ff939\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/081f6ad7c9bebd84907aef7f15ab2e5c005ff939/56_0_3441_2065/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Middlesbrough struggled in muddy and wet conditions at Rodney Parade in the fourth round.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Middlesbrough struggled in muddy and wet conditions at Rodney Parade in the fourth round.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>3) Lampard will not view the FA Cup as an unwelcome distraction</strong></h2> <p>So Frank Lampard, do you stick or twist? With Derby continuing to push hard for promotion from the Championship, their manager could be forgiven for looking upon an FA Cup tie away to Premier League opponents as an unwanted distraction that his team are unlikely to win anyway. So make a load of changes and take the hit. That, however, would go against Lampard\u2019s approach to facing top-flight sides in cup competitions this season \u2013 strong sides were sent out against Manchester United and Chelsea in the Carabao Cup as well as against Southampton (twice) in the FA Cup. So expect more of the same from the visitors to the Amex Stadium, and given Brighton\u2019s form \u2013 four defeats and three draws from their last seven matches \u2013 a strong start could end with Derby on the right side of a shock. <strong>SN</strong></p> <h2>4) Watford should forget the fringe benefits and focus on silverware</h2> <p>Javi Gracia\u2019s assessment of QPR as a team in good form seems generous, but this may well be, as the Spaniard predicts, \u201ca very demanding game\u201d. In their two FA Cup games this season not one Watford player has kept his place from the preceding league fixture. Given the settled nature of their side \u2013 only 16 players have made more than five league starts this season \u2013 the possibility of cup appearances has been the only way the Spaniard has been able to incentivise fringe players. For a club that has reached a major final only once, and never won any competition more prestigious than the third tier, is it now time for the Hornets to change tack? Should they claim a place in the quarter-finals Watford will be, at worst, the fourth highest-ranked side still in the competition; they would probably expect even their second string to beat a woefully out-of-form QPR. <strong>SB</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>5) AFC Wimbledon have 610,000 reasons to beat Millwall</strong></h2> <p>Rock bottom of League One but not so adrift that all hope of staying up has gone, Wimbledon entertain Millwall from the division above at the 4,850-capacity Kingsmeadow, where visiting fans will have an allocation of 750 tickets. This is the only match from eight not being televised, which means both clubs will miss out on the always welcome windfall earned for welcoming the TV cameras. But with \u00a3360,000 in prize-money going to the winners of this match, this is not a game either cash-strapped club can take lightly. With \u00a3250,000 also going to the Football League team from each division that goes the furthest, Wimbledon would earn that bonus if they win and Doncaster go out to Crystal Palace. This may not be the glamour tie either struggling side hoped for, but it is one that each will be very eager to win. <strong>BG</strong></p> <h2>6) Sarri cannot hold back Hudson-Odoi without reason</h2> <p>Since ending a transfer window in which Callum Hudson-Odoi\u2019s pursuit by Bayern Munich was one of the longest-running and most intriguing stories by insisting the player is \u201cthe future of our club \u2026 the future of English football\u201d, Maurizio Sarri has been almost comically reluctant to let him actually play. He was not in the squad to face Bournemouth because \u201cone winger had to be in the stands\u201d, played 13 minutes against Huddersfield and was back out of the squad for the visit to Manchester City, before getting another six minutes of action at Malm\u00f6. But he has played every minute of Chelsea\u2019s FA Cup run, claiming two assists against Nottingham Forest and a goal against Sheffield Wednesday. The last thing Sarri needs, having guided his team to an aggregate scoreline of 0-13 in their last four domestic away games, is to invite further criticism by wilfully and unnecessarily ignoring a popular youth-team product. But Manchester United are a very different prospect to Chelsea\u2019s last two Cup opponents, so it will be interesting to see whether Hudson-Odoi starts again and if not, how Sarri explains it. <strong>SB</strong></p> <h2><strong>7) Doncaster could be the perfect fodder for Benteke</strong></h2> <p>Whisper it quietly but Christian Benteke might be ready to be good at football again. Nobody should be getting carried away given this is a striker who has not scored since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/28/crystal-palace-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Crystal Palace\u2019s 5-0 victory over Leicester</a> in late April, but the Belgian is back for Roy Hodgson\u2019s side after recovering from a knee injury and, having started their last two games, shown glimpses of the talent that persuaded Liverpool to once spend \u00a332.5m on him. A trip to Doncaster represents a chance for Benteke to further his return to form and score that long-awaited goal. It will not be easy against in-form opponents but Doncaster have the worst defence in League One\u2019s top six \u2013 39 goals conceded in 31 games \u2013 and that should also fuel Benteke with confidence for this fixture. <strong>SN</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bae9469df01298f77b19fc9b18b92489a1904d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bae9469df01298f77b19fc9b18b92489a1904d1/0_130_3898_2339/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christian Benteke has not scored since April last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christian Benteke has not scored since April last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sebastian Frej/MB Media/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>8) Wolves must learn lesson and play their best XI</strong></h2> <p>It is fair to say Wolves have got to the fifth-round the hard way. First, Liverpool <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/07/wolves-liverpool-fa-cup-third-round-match-report\">were despatched at Molineux</a>, before two fourth-round games against Shrewsbury in which Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s men twice had to battle back against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/05/wolves-shrewsbury-town-fa-cup-fourth-round-replay-match-report\">resilient opponents</a>. Now comes another test \u2013 Bristol City, who sit fifth in the Championship and have won each of their last nine games in all competitions, including a third-round <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/05/bristol-city-huddersfield-fa-cup-match-report\">victory over Huddersfield</a>. Lee Johnson\u2019s men with hope they can take another Premier League scalp at Ashton Gate on Sunday but Wolves are formidable opponents when they are at full-strength \u2013 which was not the case in either game against Shrewsbury \u2013 so should the likes of R\u00faben Neves, Jo\u00e3o Moutinho and Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez start at the weekend then they should prevail. In this most open of competitions who knows how far Wolves could go. <strong>SN</strong></p> <h2><strong>9) Swansea hoping for a positive as off-field issues swirl</strong></h2> <p>Swansea City won by the odd goal of five when they travelled to Brentford in December and will enjoy home advantage when the two meet again on Saturday. Currently seven points off the play-offs, Swansea are performing commendably considering their manager, Graham Potter, has been forced to work with one arm tied behind his back during this, his maiden season in England. The 43-year-old has been undermined by his employers in two consecutive transfer windows and is currently dealing with the aftermath of the resignation of Huw Jenkins as chairman. With the Swansea City Supporters\u2019 Trust currently embroiled in a dispute with American owners, Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien, the players will struggle to match all that off-field drama when their threadbare, academy-reliant team lines up. While making the last eight and potentially going further should not be beyond them, it would mark a fine achievement in a season of extreme turbulence. <strong>BG</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6171a3a21a109daa2080e6847ed625a5734a51f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6171a3a21a109daa2080e6847ed625a5734a51f6/0_37_3131_1878/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swansea owners Jason Levien (left) and Steve Kaplan (right) are under pressure from Swansea fans.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swansea owners Jason Levien (left) and Steve Kaplan (right) are under pressure from Swansea fans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Athena Pictures/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>10) History and current form count against QPR</h2> <p>The FA Cup has provided QPR with their only wins of 2019, the club sitting bottom of the Championship form table after a winless run that dates back to Boxing Day. As the new year dawned they were eighth and cautiously eyeing the play-offs; now they are 16th, only a point better off and grateful the bottom three are sufficiently hopeless that the Hoops are only three points closer to the trapdoor than in December. Still, they are in the FA Cup in mid-February, which is a novel sensation. QPR\u2019s Cup record is abysmal; they have already won as many ties this season as in the last 17 put together. The last time they went past the fifth round it was 1995 and even then they needed a stoppage-time Clive Wilson penalty to get past Millwall. There seems little cause, either from form or long-term history, for genuine optimism. <strong>SB</strong></p>",

While making the last eight and potentially going further should not be beyond them, it would mark a fine achievement in a season of extreme turbulence. BG 10) History and current form count against QPR The FA Cup has provided QPR with their only wins of 2019, the club sitting bottom of the Championship form table after a winless run that dates back to Boxing Day. As the new year dawned they were eighth and cautiously eyeing the play-offs; now they are 16th, only a point better off and grateful the bottom three are sufficiently hopeless that the Hoops are only three points closer to the trapdoor than in December. Still, they are in the FA Cup in mid-February, which is a novel sensation. QPR\u2019s Cup record is abysmal; they have already won as many ties this season as in the last 17 put together. The last time they went past the fifth round it was 1995 and even then they needed a stoppage-time Clive Wilson penalty to get past Millwall. There seems little cause, either from form or long-term history, for genuine optimism. SB",
