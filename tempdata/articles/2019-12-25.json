Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s crucial for everyone to be free to say what they think and for politicians to respond, but democracy shouldn\u2019t be about decibel levels. An opinion is no more valid because it is expressed more loudly, repeatedly, or abusively.\u201d</p> <p>He quickly accepted that he has become known for raising his voice, but added: \u201cWhat bothers me is there are people on the internet and in some newspapers who cannot entertain the idea that anyone can honourably hold an opinion which differs from their own. They are the angels and anyone who dares disagree is the devil who wants the country to be poorer, less free, or less secure. That mindset started to infect parliament too. That is wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf democrats show no respect for each other, it just encourages anti-democrats. It\u2019s high time we learned to disagree agreeably.\u201d</p> <p>He went on to say his best friend was not an extremist, a racist, or a fascist because he was a Brexiter, nor was he a traitor, a malcontent, or an enemy of the people because he was a remainer.</p> <p>Bercow follows the actor Danny Dyer, the whistleblower Edward Snowden and Brendan Cox, the husband of the murdered MP Jo Cox, in delivering the annual rival to the Queen\u2019s broadcast. Channel 4 has produced an alternative message for the past 25 years.</p> <p>The speech was delivered from a classroom in Bercow\u2019s children\u2019s state secondary school. He went on to criticise the role social media has played in amplifying hatred, racism, misogyny and abuse.</p> <p>\u201cAs I sit here in my kids\u2019 fantastic state secondary, I have to say I worry about that. Incidentally, if you want to see an example of respectful debate, take a look at the UK youth parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cThey spoke well, respected one another, and behaved better than many political campaigners, two, three and four times their age.\u201d</p> <p>Bercow continued: \u201cLet\u2019s take inspiration from young people. They are the future. Let\u2019s try to re-establish a civility of discourse. It would be good for parliament, for democracy, and for our own mental health \u2013 an issue which is finally getting the attention it needs.\u201d</p> <p>As Bercow\u2019s calls for \u201cOrder!\u201d have made him an international celebrity, he ended his speech saying it with a group of schoolchildren.</p>",

Bercow, who stepped down in November after more than 10 years in the role, said democracy had taken a pounding: \u201cAll around the world, populism and the promise of simple solutions to complex problems has taken hold with a vice-like grip. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s crucial for everyone to be free to say what they think and for politicians to respond, but democracy shouldn\u2019t be about decibel levels. An opinion is no more valid because it is expressed more loudly, repeatedly, or abusively.\u201d He quickly accepted that he has become known for raising his voice, but added: \u201cWhat bothers me is there are people on the internet and in some newspapers who cannot entertain the idea that anyone can honourably hold an opinion which differs from their own. They are the angels and anyone who dares disagree is the devil who wants the country to be poorer, less free, or less secure. That mindset started to infect parliament too. That is wrong.\u201d \u201cIf democrats show no respect for each other, it just encourages anti-democrats. It\u2019s high time we learned to disagree agreeably.\u201d He went on to say his best friend was not an extremist, a racist, or a fascist because he was a Brexiter, nor was he a traitor, a malcontent, or an enemy of the people because he was a remainer. Bercow follows the actor Danny Dyer, the whistleblower Edward Snowden and Brendan Cox, the husband of the murdered MP Jo Cox, in delivering the annual rival to the Queen\u2019s broadcast. Channel 4 has produced an alternative message for the past 25 years. The speech was delivered from a classroom in Bercow\u2019s children\u2019s state secondary school. He went on to criticise the role social media has played in amplifying hatred, racism, misogyny and abuse. \u201cAs I sit here in my kids\u2019 fantastic state secondary, I have to say I worry about that. Incidentally, if you want to see an example of respectful debate, take a look at the UK youth parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cThey spoke well, respected one another, and behaved better than many political campaigners, two, three and four times their age.\u201d Bercow continued: \u201cLet\u2019s take inspiration from young people. They are the future. Let\u2019s try to re-establish a civility of discourse. It would be good for parliament, for democracy, and for our own mental health \u2013 an issue which is finally getting the attention it needs.\u201d As Bercow\u2019s calls for \u201cOrder!\u201d have made him an international celebrity, he ended his speech saying it with a group of schoolchildren.",
