      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet is divided over how to proceed with Brexit, as the prime minister faces the stark choice of pressing ahead with his deal or gambling his premiership on a pre-Christmas general election. After an inconclusive meeting with Jeremy Corbyn on Wednesday morning in an attempt to agree an acceptable timetable for parliament to consider the bill, the prime minister told MPs at Wednesday\u2019s PMQs that he was awaiting the decision of the EU27 over whether to grant an extension before settling his next move. The EU\u2019s decision is unlikely to come before Friday. Some cabinet ministers, including the Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, are cautious about asking for an election. They believe the majority of 30 achieved by the government on the second reading of the Brexit bill on Tuesday suggests Johnson\u2019s deal has enough support to carry it through all its stages in parliament. Smith, who was Theresa May\u2019s chief whip, has examined the various amendments to the withdrawal agreement bill, and does not believe any of them would necessitate pulling it. \u201cJulian\u2019s view is that the numbers are there,\u201d said an ally. Some Tory MPs said there also were serious misgivings on the back benches about the idea of an immediate election. \u201cThere\u2019s a big, big fight going on, basically,\u201d one said. \u201cThe parliamentary party is split 50/50. Personally, I don\u2019t think an election is a very good idea.\u201d Another said: \u201cI\u2019d rather we focused more on passing the bill. It would be better to go to voters having finished the job. I feel that\u2019s what most colleagues want.\u201d However, hard Brexit supporters appear to be more gung-ho, with leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg fearing support for the bill could yet fall away \u2013 if the 19 Labour rebels who backed it fail to secure the amendments they would like to see, for example. Members of the Eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG) are also nervous about the legislation being amended in a way that they would find unacceptable \u2013 such as obliging the government to seek a customs union. After Johnson\u2019s meeting with Corbyn on Wednesday, Downing Street briefed that Corbyn had \u201cmade clear Labour have no policy except more delays\u201d and hinted heavily that Johnson\u2019s next move would be to ask MPs to support a December election. \u201cAny time that parliament gets a vote for delay, it will always choose delay,\u201d said a Downing Street source. \u201cTherefore, if this parliament is unwilling to vote for a deal, we will have to go for a general election.\u201d Despite the bullish rhetoric, Johnson\u2019s chief whip, Mark Spencer, later met his Labour counterpart, Nick Brown, to explore whether a new timetable could be agreed for scrutinising the bill. That suggested the idea of trying to pilot the bill through parliament had not been ditched altogether \u2013 particularly if only a short extension is granted. In the meeting between the two party leaders, held in the same Westminster office where Corbyn had previously confronted May, Dominic Cummings suggested MPs should be prepared to sit all night to hit next week\u2019s Halloween deadline, according to one witness. Meanwhile, Johnson has been trying to persuade EU leaders not to grant an extension \u2013 or at least to keep it short. The PM spoke to Donald Tusk on Wednesday morning, telling the European council\u2019s president, who has called for EU leaders to allow a further Brexit extension, that he does not personally want a delay. He also discussed the issue with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Johnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cThe PM was clear in restating his position that he does not believe that any delay beyond 31 October is in the interests of the UK or the EU and that we need to get the deal through parliament before that point.\u201d The prime minister was forced to write to the EU on Saturday to seek a delay until 31 January under a backbench-instigated law averting no deal, but had hoped to rush the bill putting his plan into law through parliament this week, to meet the current 31 October deadline. Corbyn used all his questions at PMQs to ask Johnson about elements of the bill, including standards for environmental, consumer and workers\u2019 rights, and the continued inclusion of Northern Ireland in elements of the EU\u2019s customs union. After Johnson incorrectly said there would be \u201cno checks between Northern Ireland and GB [Great Britain]\u201d, Corbyn accused him of having not properly read his own bill. \u201cThe prime minister unlawfully prorogued parliament; he said he would refuse to comply with [the] law; he threw Northern Ireland under a bus; he ripped up protections for workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections; lost every vote along the way; and tried to prevent genuine, democratic scrutiny and debate,\u201d the Labour leader said. \u201cEven worse than that, he\u2019s not that familiar with it.\u201d",

The first is that Johnson has succeeded, albeit so far only briefly, in assembling a majority for withdrawal from the EU. That achievement should not be dismissed, in spite of all the surrounding distractions, or because remainers will devoutly wish it had not happened. It was a majority that eluded Theresa May three humiliating times among exactly the same MPs. But that majority has always been latent in the House of Commons. On the face of things, it would now appear to lay the ground for Johnson to bring about the Brexit that his party elected him to achieve in July, and for which the majority voted in 2016.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The risk is that parliament could decide to finish the job on terms that would blow the majority for a deal wide apart</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Yet the second significant conclusion is that Johnson is a prime minister who remains, rightly in the circumstances, the hostage of a sovereign parliament. In the hung parliament that the nation elected to deal with Brexit in 2017, he has no majority.</p> \n<p>He can therefore only secure Brexit either by making war on parliament and hoping it buckles, or by making important concessions to other parties and factions. Having tried the former and been defeated, he is now coming to terms with the latter. The concessions he must consider are procedural, showing more respect for proper process, and substantive, altering some of the contents of the withdrawal terms. These are extremely difficult to balance, as he found out on Tuesday evening. But they remain the key to the Brexit outcome.</p> \n<p>It is natural, given his instinctive resentment of both hard work and being humiliated, that Johnson chafes against this. But although the situation is difficult, it ought not to present insuperable problems. There is real momentum \u2013 even if some of it is spurious and a lot of it is media driven \u2013 behind the view that Brexit should be delivered soon. The coalition that backed his bill on Tuesday is proof of that.</p> \n<p>Johnson initially held back from trying to consolidate his achievement because he feared loss of face from the Brexit extension that parliament wants, and which was the probable consequence of his timetable motion defeat. But since that extension would probably involve, at most, a few weeks, and since Labour appears willing to negotiate with him, that hardly gives him a valid reason for withdrawing his bill. It certainly does not justify another attempt to call a general election before Brexit has been clarified, even though the current poll numbers and the desire to take on Labour while Jeremy Corbyn remains leader will make it tempting.</p> \n<p>The more difficult task, which the fast-track timetable was designed to avoid, is to control the shape of the bill that emerges from a more detailed phase of parliamentary scrutiny. MPs have applied the brakes, so they may soon have the chance to amend the bill in the committee stage. Attempts will be made from a variety of quarters to retain membership of the EU customs union, to protect employment and environmental regulatory alignments, to make the bill dependent on a second referendum, to block the possibility of a no-deal exit at the end of the transition period, and to give the devolved parliaments a say in the process.</p> \n<p>Johnson may well decide to tough out all these attempts. After all, he now has a contingent majority for his bill, which he will try hard to protect. He may also judge that there is no overall majority for any of the individual amendments and that this House of Commons will fail \u2013 as it did on the indicative votes in March and April \u2013 to come together to back the ones most likely to win. He will trade on the public\u2019s presumed impatience for closure. He may well be right to do so.

The full article is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/22/what-just-happened-in-the-commons-and-whats-next-for-brexit\">here</a> and a selection of answers are below:</p> \n  <h2>So what just happened?</h2> \n  <p>In brief: the bill seeking to put into law Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal was passed by MPs on its second reading, the initial opportunity that MPs have to vote on a bill. It passed by 329 votes to 299, the first time the Commons has formally approved a Brexit plan. However, only 20 minutes later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/22/mps-reject-boris-johnsons-attempt-to-fast-track-brexit-deal\">MPs rejected the government\u2019s so-called programme motion</a>, which set out the accelerated timetable for the bill, by 308 votes in favour to 322 against.</p> \n  <h2>So what happens now?<br></h2> \n  <p>Under a backbench-instigated law intended to ward off a no-deal Brexit, Johnson wrote to the EU on Saturday to formally request a delay to departure until 31 January, despite the PM not wanting this to happen. Responding in the Commons, Johnson said he would \u201cpause this legislation\u201d and await information from the EU on a possible delay. In the interim, he said, no-deal preparations would be ramped up. For now, the bill is \u201cin limbo\u201d, Speaker John Bercow said, using what he said was the technical term.</p> \n  <h2>Is the bill getting pulled?</h2> \n  <p>Downing Street had strongly hinted this would be the response to losing the programme motion. However, this seems to have been a lever to pressure MPs into backing the motion. Speaking during the debate ahead of the votes, Johnson pledged he would pull the bill and seek an election in the event of a delay until January or longer. But he did not promise to do this in any circumstances, holding open the possibility of a brief delay being acceptable. After the vote, Johnson was similarly equivocal, saying: \u201cOne way or another, we will leave the EU with this deal.\u201d</p> \n  <h2>Does all this make a general election more likely?</h2> \n  <p>Probably. If the EU insists on a lengthy delay, which is put in place, Johnson could push for an election. Crucially, if an imminent no-deal Brexit was now averted, Labour would be expected to now back an election, making it happen. However, for all his protestations against a longer delay, the 30-vote majority for his Brexit deal could tempt Johnson into trying to push the bill through parliament before an election, allowing him to stand as the prime minister who delivered departure.</p> \n  <h2>What will MPs do for the rest of this week?</h2> \n  <p>On Wednesday and Thursday, when they should have been finishing off the stages of the WAB, they will instead return to debating the Queen\u2019s speech. Remember that? The government\u2019s planned legislative programme was presented on Monday last week, but the scheduled five-day debate was suspended for the WAB debate.

      "bodyText": "On this week\u2019s episode of the Guardian\u2019s politics weekly podcast, Heather Stewart is joined by Polly Toynbee, Jill Rutter and Tom McTague to discuss what Boris Johnson will do after parliament voted to reject his timetable for the passage of the Brexit withdrawal bill. Peter Walker also reports on who\u2019s in the running to be the next Speaker of the House of Commons Thanks for following the blog today. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning. One last footnote though in relation to moves we reported on earlier this week by Ukip to suspend its leader Richard Braine amid a fresh power struggle within the party. This comes from Companies House filings: \u2022 Downing Street is pushing the possibility of a general election after talks between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn on a new timetable for his Brexit bill broke up without agreement, but Labour declined to say it would support an immediate poll. No 10 also said that Johnson spoke to Donald Tusk on Wednesday morning, telling the European council\u2019s president, who has called for EU leaders to allow a further Brexit extension, that he does not personally want one. \u2022 The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, and the European parliament\u2019s president have backed Donald Tusk\u2019s call to grant the UK government a Brexit delay up to 31 January 2020. Following a phone call between Tusk, the president of the European council, and Varadkar on Wednesday morning, the two men agreed the EU27 should agree to the request reluctantly tabled by Boris Johnson on Saturday. \u2022 Unionist MPs have branded the government\u2019s approach to Northern Ireland in the Brexit talks \u201cdespicable\u201d and a \u201cbetrayal\u201d. In his first appearance before the Northern Ireland affairs select committee, Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, was questioned about plans to require businesses selling or transiting goods from the region to Britain to complete special paperwork in order to trade post-Brexit. \u2022 The home secretary, Priti Patel, has told MPs that immigration officials were working closely with the police after 39 bodies were found inside a Bulgarian-registered lorry on an industrial estate in Essex. A murder investigation is under way after police officers were called by the ambulance service shortly before 1.40am on Wednesday following the discovery of a container with people inside. Appearing at the home affairs committee, Patel said: \u201cAs a live investigation, there is not much we can add to that right now. And from what I gather things are moving quite quickly on that. The European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, has this on a meeting today, which adds weight to shortening odds of a \u201cFlextension\u201d being the preferred reply to the UK government\u2019s request for an extension. The Tory former leader of the House of Commons, Mel Stride, has been elected as the new chairman of the influential Treasury committee. The Speaker, John Bercow, informed MPs of the result of the ballot in the Commons in a statement during the Queen\u2019s speech debate. Stride, who was present alongside his fellow nominees to hear the news, said he hoped his committee could \u201cbring forward some illumination and light\u201d at a time of \u201cgreat sound and fury in this chamber\u201d. Proposals for \u201cA&amp;E locals\u201d were compared to Tesco Express shops as Labour raised concerns about government reforms to the NHS during the ongoing debate on the Queen\u2019s speech. The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, sought answers over changes to the Princess Royal hospital in Telford after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, asked NHS England to keep open the service. It is among those being considered under plans for \u201cA&amp;E locals\u201d although health bosses have questioned what this means. Ashworth also claimed the government\u2019s immigration plans could leave 60,000 NHS workers unable to stay in the UK. Speaker John Bercow selected Labour\u2019s amendment which notes \u201cregret\u201d over the Queen\u2019s Speech failure to repeal the Health and Social Care Act 2012, arguing this needs to happen to \u201cprotect\u201d the NHS from future trade agreements which could allow increased privatisation. Any Brexit extension is likely to be a flexible one that would allow the UK to leave the EU prior to the end of January, Ireland\u2019s deputy premier has said. Simon Coveney, said the Irish government would be supportive of an extension but he cautioned that he was not speaking on behalf of the other EU states and said it was a case of \u201cwait and see\u201d if any of them raised \u201cissues\u201d with the move. Speaking to business leaders in Belfast, he said: From the Irish government\u2019s perspective we are supportive of facilitating an extension. I think that extension will be a flexible one that will allow the United Kingdom to leave the EU, if they can get a deal done, well in advance of the end of that extension period, which looks like it might be the end of January. The former Labour (now independent) MP, Ivan Lewis, appears to have moved with some certainty into the cohort of those supporting the prime minster\u2019s Brexit deal. Lewis, who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal, has tweeted: YouGov has been carrying out some snap polling and finds that votes are fairly split on when they would prefer a general election. One in the spring (40% support) shades it over one by the end of the year. Government thinking on development and aid priorities following Brexit should take note of new research out today showing that the British public remains firmly behind efforts to support people in poorer countries, according to aid organisations. Almost two-thirds of people canvassed in a survey of EU citizens believe that maintaining overseas aid at its current level should be \u201ca major priority\u201d, the Guardian\u2019s Lucy Lamble reports. It\u2019s perhaps worth keeping in mind also that while any impending general election is likely to be firmly centred around Brexit, overseas aid has increasingly become a political football, with the Brexit party making pledges to slash the spending. The results from Eurobarometer, the EU\u2019s polling organisation, also found that almost 90% of people thought helping people in developing countries should be a priority of the EU and national governments. Claire Godfrey, interim director of policy, advocacy and research at Bond, the British network for organisations working in international development, said the survey was \u201cincredibly timely\u201d as the UK government begins to redefine its role in a post-Brexit world. The government, and any future government, should take note of these results when thinking about what our development and aid priorities should be following Brexit. There has been a response of studied fury to Boris Johnson\u2019s response to SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford during FMQs today that the Scottish parliament \u201chas no role\u201d in approving his current withdrawal deal. While it was immediately pointed out that the bill\u2019s own explanatory notes list more than a dozen instances where consent of the devolved administrations is required, the first ministers of Scotland and Wales, Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford, this afternoon accused the prime minister of trying to rush through the EU withdrawal agreement without scrutiny. They both added that said the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly were likely to refuse to give consent for the withdrawal agreement bill, and called for the devolved nations to be given a greater say. SNP MP and Brexit legal challenger Joanna Cherry said that the prime minister was \u201cwholly wrong\u201d and \u201ca stranger to the truth\u201d, while Scotland\u2019s Brexit secretary, Michael Russell, described Johnson\u2019s dismissal as \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d, adding that the Scottish government had already identified a number of additional parts of the bill that required legislative consent too. Point of info: since 1999, the Sewel convention has held that Westminster will not legislate on devolved matters without the consent of the devolved parliaments, but in 2017 the supreme court appeared to undermine this convention by ruling that because it is political in nature, enforcing it was not a matter for the courts. Businesses and the public should continue to get ready for a no-deal Brexit, the government has warned, as a minister said there was still uncertainty about how the UK will leave the EU. This was from earlier when minister without portfolio James Cleverly told MPs that the \u201conly responsible course of action\u201d, is to \u201caccelerate\u201d no-deal planning. He said more preparations were needed because the EU has not yet responded to calls for an extension to the 31 October Brexit deadline. Cleverly told the Commons: Making sure business and the public are ready for Brexit is a priority of the government; that is why the prime minister negotiated a new withdrawal agreement with the EU which will end the uncertainty, secure the implementation period and ensure we leave with a business-friendly deal. As the EU has not responded to parliament\u2019s letter, the only responsible course of action now is to accelerate preparations for a no-deal outcome. Those comments are interesting to read alongside this piece in the Guardian by a civil servant who is currently part of the Operation Yellowhammer planning for a no-deal scenario. Much of this Yellowhammer shtick is just for show, they write, adding: Heaven help us if no deal actually happens. Because, even with the best efforts of civil servants like me, Operation Yellowhammer won\u2019t be enough, even with its enormous price tag. Not even close. And while \u2013 outrageously \u2013 there won\u2019t be any economic analysis prepared by the government on the impact of the new deal, we already know \u2013 thanks to Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts \u2013 that the impact of no deal will make the \u00a36.3bn spent this year on no-deal planning look like peanuts. The intransigence of members of the hardline European Research Group (ERG) in the face of attempts by Theresa May to get MPs to accept her Brexit deal was one of the principle flashpoints of her time in office. So what changed? Phil Burton-Cartledge, a lecturer in sociology at the University of Derby, argues that their volte-face may have been encouraged by aligned financial interests: A deskilled, low-wage workforce with few rights, and the UK a playground for footloose corporations to shake their tail at the EU\u2019s regulatory regime from 21 miles across the Channel, would suit them perfectly. Therefore when you look at the kind of businesses associated with or owned by ERG notables, such as Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s emerging markets fund or Steve Baker\u2019s financial services holdings, it suggests their penchant for transforming the country into a no-regulation tax haven may align with their interests. Ideology and principles come second. If the EU does agree to a three-month delay to Brexit until 31 January then the prime minister has three options if he decides to push for an election. The Guardian\u2019s Kate Proctor has been looking at all three, which are: \u2022 A motion for a general election. \u2022 A one-line bill. \u2022 A no-confidence motion. Of the first option, which is seen as the government\u2019s favoured option because it is unamendable and gives a fixed election date, she writes: Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, an election may be called if it is agreed by two-thirds of the total number of MPs. Boris Johnson presented motions for an election on 4 and 9 September and failed on both occasions when the majority of Labour MPs abstained. Jeremy Corbyn said he would only back an election once the threat of a no-deal Brexit had been taken off the table. Johnson could try this again and potentially get Labour backing because the Benn act has removed the imminent possibility of a no-deal Brexit. For those wondering when Brussels will make any concrete pronouncements on that reluctant Boris Johnson request for a Brexit extension: Businesses remain \u201cat a loss\u201d about what Brexit preparations they should be making amid continued confusion about the future, according to a business leader. The Chartered Management Institute (CMI) said progress on parliament\u2019s support for a deal had been undermined by the timetable being voted down and the \u201cinflexibility\u201d of the government\u2019s response. Chief executive Ann Francke said: Businesses are again lost as to what Brexit preparations they should be making, creating economic uncertainty. Are we deal or no-deal? Clearly we should deal. To do so, the prime minister needs to take a pragmatic, cooperative approach to his work with both parliament and the European Union, to ensure the UK secures a deal. Kevin Brundish, chief executive of AGM Batteries, said each day of Brexit uncertainty means firms are withholding key investment decisions. As demand for batteries continues to rise, leading UK manufacturers like ourselves are hoping for the UK government to settle on the right deal, fast. The fragile economy needs promise of ongoing stimulation if we are to keep up with the expansion of the market. One place where there appears to be some confusion around Brexit preparations is at this London bus stop, where government \u201cGet Ready\u201d digital advertising appears to be in some disarray. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has criticised the abuse directed at the 19 Labour MPs who voted to support the WAB\u2019s second reading on Tuesday. As reported earlier, Lisa Nandy MP tweeted emails sent to her labelling her \u201cscum\u201d. A spokesman for Corbyn told the Press Association: \u201cHe has made very clear that there shouldn\u2019t be abuse inside the Labour party or inside politics and that we would seek to rely on persuasion to keep the Labour party together in this process and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done all the way through.\u201d Asked whether there would be repercussions for the Labour rebels after defying the whip, the spokesman said: \u201cAs Jeremy has made clear throughout the whole Brexit process, we have sought to rely on persuasion in relation to keeping the Labour party together in parliament and outside. \u201cI think most of those MPs were making clear their support for a second reading was in order to try and make changes to the proposals to bring them into line with the kind of Brexit deal we have been talking about. \u201cThe chief whip has made clear these things will be taken into account as a whole once the process is finished.\u201d Adam Bienkov, UK Political Editor of Business Insider, tweets an exchange he had with the prime minister\u2019s spokesman when attempting to ask why Boris Johnson has insisted that there won\u2019t be checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, even though his own impact assessment states that there will. A useful overview now of where things really stand in relation to the Brexit timetable which MPs rejected this week, the EU\u2019s response and whether or not European leaders will agree to a Brexit extension. Dan Boffey, the Guardian\u2019s Brussels bureau chief, reports that Donald Tusk, president of the European council, will be arguing that the EU should remain neutral. Dan adds: By granting the UK government the extension it requested, the bloc can best avoid being dragged into the British debate. Should Johnson formally and publicly propose a different extension length, then the situation will be very different. The successful vote on the second reading has offered some hope to Brussels that there is a majority for ratification, and that a general election might not be necessary. But a new request from Johnson would not appear to be in compliance with the Benn act, which instructed him to make a specific request and then agree it with the EU if they were in accord. Sources in Paris have suggested there should be a further delay of only a \u201cfew days\u201d to allow for ratification. That would leave the EU jointly culpable for a no-deal Brexit, if swift ratification was not possible. Tusk will counsel against it. Poland\u2019s Europe minister has rejected a plea by the Polish-born Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski to veto an extension to Brexit, according to Jakub Krupa, the former UK correspondent for the Polish Press Agency. Krupa was told that a \u201cno-deal Brexit is not in the Polish interest and we will have no part in this\u201d. Not that the news comes as any particular surprise. A split in Downing Downing street has opened up between Boris Johnson\u2019s chief aide, Dominic Cummings, other senior officials and Tory ministers and MPs over what to do after the failed attempt to ram a Brexit deal through parliament this week, BuzzFeed reports. A piece from Alex Wickham says: \u201cIt is the latest dividing line in the story of Johnson\u2019s \u201ctwo governments\u201d \u2013 the factional rivalry of two sides of Number 10 vying for influence that has been one of the defining features of his premiership. \u201cCummings has been the main driving force behind the renewed push for an immediate election, multiple sources familiar with the conversations in Downing Street told BuzzFeed News.\u201d Sky\u2019s Sam Coates tweets a denial from Downing Street: A bit more is coming out now on where things stand in relation to engagement between Labour and the Tories on a possible election. From a Labour briefing, the BBC\u2019s Nick Watt says on Twitter that it looks like the party would need a cast iron legally binding assurance from the prime minister of an election date before backing it. If the EU grants an extension to 31 January then Labour would need a legal guarantee of election before then, he adds. Boris Johnson said earlier that the events which had come to light in Essex were \u2018truly heartbreaking,\u2019 while other MPs, including Jeremy Corbyn, also spoke about the incident and paid tribute to the emergency services. We\u2019ve got some footage of those contributions: The SNP MP Peter Grant asked the home secretary what assurances could be given to anyone with information about the case in Essex but who were afraid to come forward that they would be treated as a victim of crime. Patel described this as a really important point but that the legislation which had been put in place on modern slavery meant that there were active support measures in place and she would encourage anyone with information to come forward. Hywel Williams, a Plaid Cymru MP for Arfon, said: \u201cHolyhead is the second busiest roll on, roll off port in the United Kingdom, yet there is no permanent immigration enforcement presence at the port.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d Patel replied that she had made it clear that when it came to Border Force and checks they took place through intelligence-led operations. Because what was being dealt with in Essex was potentially an illegal criminal act she wanted to leave it to investigators to deal with. During questions to the home secretary in the House of Commons, the DUP MP Ian Paisley junior said around 39 to 40 MPs were sitting on the benches on his side of the House of Commons. One way of getting a picture of the scale of human destruction inside the lorry container in Essex was to bear that in mind. While not commenting on the specific case in Essex, he went on to urge Priti Patel to look into what he said was a broader problem of paramilitary gangs in Northern Ireland attempting to circumvent border checks and to see what additional checks were needed on the UK\u2019s existing border along Northern Ireland. John Woodcock made a call for sentencing in relation to people smuggling to be brought into line with sentences allotted in the case of murder. Unionist MPs have branded the government\u2019s approach to Northern Ireland in the Brexit talks \u201cdespicable\u201d and a \u201cbetrayal\u201d. In his first appearance before the Northern Ireland affairs select committee, Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, was questioned about plans to require businesses selling or transiting goods from the region to Britain to complete special paperwork in order to trade post-Brexit. Smith\u2019s said the checks would be minimal and the focus should be on the \u201cgreat opportunities\u201d awaiting Northern Ireland. He said the government would work with businesses to ensure the withdrawal agreement bill would as far as possible allow unfettered trade between Northern Ireland and Britain. Ian Paisley, the DUP MP for North Antrim, said it was disgraceful to expect any business to complete paperwork for goods being sold in \u201cour country, not a foreign country\u201d. In the House of Commons, the former immigration minister Damian Green has sought assurances from Priti Patel that the UK border force authorities would be able to cover not just Holyhead and other major ports but all ports around the UK. \u201cIt is going to require a defence of the whole United Kingdom if we are going to be be successful in saving lives in the future,\u201d said Green. Patel replied that there had been a \u201cgreat deal of work\u201d done on preventing people trafficking through routes such as Kent on small boats and the UK was committed to working far more collaboratively to ensure all ports are prepared. Christine Jardine, an Edinburgh Liberal Democrat MP, asked Patel to agree with her that \u201cwe have to look at our own immigration system and repair it to ensure that what we provide is fair, compassionate and effective for those who want to come here\u201d. Thanking Jardine for her comments, Patel added: \u201cI think today is not the day to be talking about an immigration system at all.\u201d \u201cWe have migration challenges that we are seeing around the world. People are being displaced in record numbers and many are being displaced and preyed upon through some of the most appalling behaviours, through criminal gangs.\u201d This is Ben Quinn picking up the liveblog now from Frances.

Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn met on Wednesday morning but failed to agree a timetable for pressing ahead with the \u201cpaused\u201d Brexit bill. Corbyn was accompanied by his key adviser Seumas Milne, and Johnson by Dominic Cummings, as well as the two parties\u2019 respective chief whips. The meeting took place in the prime minister\u2019s House of Commons office. The pair later clashed at prime minister\u2019s questions. Both said the discovery of 39 bodies in a lorry in Essex was a horrible tragedy. Labour\u2019s shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon has said that his party would back a general election if the EU grants the UK an extension to its deadline for Brexit. He told Sky news: I\u2019d like to see an election before Christmas. I want to get Boris Johnson and his Thatcherite mates out of Downing Street as soon as possible. So as soon as the EU has agreed that extension, so that Boris Johnson cannot push us through a no-deal without a mandate to do so, then we want a general election. The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, and the European parliament\u2019s president have backed Donald Tusk\u2019s call to grant the UK government a Brexit delay up to 31 January 2020. Following a phone call between Tusk, the president of the European council, and Varadkar on Wednesday morning, the two men agreed the EU27 should agree to the request reluctantly tabled by Boris Johnson on Saturday. \u201cThe taoiseach confirmed his support for President Tusk\u2019s proposal to grant the request for an extension, which was sought by the UK,\u201d a statement from the Irish government said. David Sassoli, the European parliament president, pointed out there was only one request \u201con the table\u201d and it deserved the EU27\u2019s support. Home secretary Priti Patel has made a statement to the commons on the discovery of 39 bodies in a shipping container in Essex. She said: \u201cMy thoughts and my condolences are with the victims and their loved ones at this utterly terrible time.\u201d Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said it was a \u201cterrible tragedy, the worst of its kind\u201d. \u201cEach of the 39 will have partners, family and friends who perhaps even now don\u2019t know how their loved one died and the horrible circumstances,\u201d she said. Responding to Patel, Labour\u2019s shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: Any death under these circumstances is truly appalling. The fact that there has been 39 reported deaths in this incident, it\u2019s a terrible tragedy, one of the worst of its kind. And each of the 39 will have partners, family and friends who perhaps even now don\u2019t know how their loved one died and the horrible circumstances \u2026 It\u2019s important to remember that these 39 poor, unfortunate people are the victims in this. They are preyed on by the greedy, the unscrupulous and people who simply have a wilful disregard for the lives of others. But we should take account of the wider context. Nobody leaves the homes on a journey like this with so much risk and fear on a whim. They often do it because they are actually desperate, they can be victims of economic privation, war, famine, catastrophic climate change. There are many adverse conditions that people are fleeing from\u2026 I would also like an assurance from the home secretary that the cooperation with the EU27 on people trafficking, which is vital to make sure these events don\u2019t happen in the future, will actually not become harder or imperilled because we are actually leaving the EU\u2026 There should be safe and legal routes for genuine refugees to make their way here. If they do not, then I fear there could be more tragedies like this. The home secretary, Priti Patel, just read a statement to the Commons on the discovery of 39 bodies in a shipping container in Essex. She said that police were called to an industrial park at 1.40am. The bodies of 38 adults and one teenager were found. The vehicle is believed to be from Bulgaria and entered the country at Holyhead. A 25-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder. I think the whole house will agree that this is a truly shocking incident. My thoughts and my condolences are with the victims and their loved ones at this utterly terrible time and I\u2019m sure the whole house will also convey their condolences at this sad time. She said the nationalities of the victims were not known, but her officials were providing all the assistance they could. Here\u2019s our story on that meeting between the prime minister and Jeremy Corbyn. Some more details are emerging about the meeting held between Corbyn and Boris Johnson this morning. The father of the house, Kenneth Clarke, says that the PM got the Commons to vote \u201cby a comfortable majority\u201d for Brexit. He says that if Johnson proceeds in a sensible way he could deliver Brexit in a month or two\u2019s time. \u201cWill my right honourable friend get over his disappointment and accept that Oct 31 is now Halloween and it is devoid of any symbolic or political content and will fade away into historical memory very rapidly,\u201d he says. He asks Johnson to table a reasonable timetable motion. Johnson says he still thinks it is in the best interests of the country to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by 31 October. He says he is waiting for the EU to decide whether or not to grant the UK a Brexit extension. The SNP leader in Westminster says: \u201cOur parliament doesn\u2019t matter, that\u2019s what this prime minister thinks ... He wants Scotland to trust him, but how can we? \u2026 The parliament of Scotland cannot trust this prime minister.\u201d Blackford says the PM should secure an extension then \u201cbring on an election\u201d. Johnson says Blackford\u2019s support for an election is an exciting development. \u201cPerhaps he might pass some of his courage down the line [to the Labour party],\u201d he says. The SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford says that the first ministers of Scotland and Wales have joined forces to stop \u201cthis toxic Tory Brexit\u201d. He asks him to confirm that he won\u2019t allow the legislation to pass unless consent is given by the Scottish parliament. Johnson says that the Scottish parliament has no role in approving the deal \u2013 it is up to the members of the Westminster parliament. Johnson asks him to back a general election. Corbyn says: Northern Ireland will remain on single market rules within the EU on goods and agricultural products, the rest of the UK will not \u2026 It does create a very real border down the Irish sea, something he said in terms to a DUP conference he would never do, and it wasn\u2019t that long ago. Johnson says the UK is preserved \u201cwhole and entire\u201d in the deal and the whole of the UK will be allowed to come out of the EU customs union. \u201cThere will be no checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. There will be no tariffs between Northern Ireland and Great Britain because we have protected the customs union.\u201d He attacks Corbyn\u2019s defence of the union again, citing \u201chis support of the IRA\u201d, and his support for a second independence referendum in Scotland. Corbyn says the deal damages the fabric of the union. Johnson says it\u2019s a bit rich to hear from the Labour leader about his \u201csentimental attachment\u201d to the union when he has spend most of his political lifetime supporting the IRA. Corbyn says: I hate it to break it to the prime minister, but under his government and that of his predecessor privatisation has more than doubled to \u00a310bn in our NHS. There are currently 20 NHS contracts out to tender. And when he\u2019s promised 40 hospitals, he then reduced that to 20 and then it turns out reconfiguration is taking place in just six hospitals. Johnson says Corbyn is completely wrong in his assessment of privatisation in the NHS. He says the 47,000 extra clinical staff he\u2019s promised were paid for from public funds and that was possible because the Tories believe in sound management of the economy. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that the right honourable gentleman has no other purpose in seeking to frustrate Brexit than to cause a second referendum,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cI must say I find it peculiar that [Corbyn] now wants this bill back because he voted against it last night and he whipped his entire Labour party against it,\u201d says Johnson. Corbyn says the prime minister has not answered his question on workers\u2019 rights and that the provisions in the Brexit bill offer no real protections. Johnson says it was a remarkable thing that so many MPs approved the second reading of the Brexit bill last night, but a great shame that they voted for a delay. Jeremy Corbyn stands up and expresses his own remorse for those who were found dead in Essex. \u201cThis is an unbelievable human tragedy that happened in our country at this time,\u201d he says. He says we should think about what inhumanity is done to other human beings. Corbyn goes on to say that yesterday the prime minister \u201cdecided to delay his own withdrawal bill\u201d. Predictably, Tory MPs don\u2019t like that interpretation of events. Johnson opens with the horrible news that 39 bodies have been found in a lorry in Essex. He says it is an awful tragedy. Labour MP Rupa Huq asks him why he doesn\u2019t get rid of Dominic Cummings. Johnson says he receives excellent advice from his advisers and he takes full responsibility for everything the government does. Boris Johnson is in his place for prime minister\u2019s questions. My colleague Daniel Avelar and I will bring you updates when he starts speaking. The EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said the EU27 need some clarification on what the UK will do next, before they decide on another Brexit extension. This is from the Times\u2019s political editor, Francis Elliott: The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, said this morning that the withdrawal agreement would take \u201ca couple of weeks\u201d to debate, not months. \u201cI don\u2019t think three months will be required to discuss the bill,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cI would have thought it can be done in a matter of weeks, but it\u2019s not for me to decide. The reality is, what was put forward was completely insufficient.\u201d You can see a reminder here of what exactly a programme motion is \u2013 The first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, and the first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, are holding a press conference in Westminster to set out the Welsh and Scottish governments\u2019 position on the Brexit withdrawal bill. Guardian political correspondent Peter Walker is there tweeting. In comments briefed ahead of the conference, Sturgeon said: The UK government has sought to pass the withdrawal bill through Westminster without an opportunity for detailed scrutiny in either the UK or Scottish parliaments. That is unacceptable. It is imperative that this bill is subject to detailed scrutiny in all of the UK\u2019s legislatures and that the views of the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly are taken into account. The European parliament, which doesn\u2019t have a say over the decision, has also come out in support of an extension until 31 January. President of the European parliament, David Sassoli, said: After the vote of the British parliament to allow more time to examine details of the withdrawal agreement and Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to pause the bill following the vote, the British government\u2019s request for an extension until January 31 remains on the table. I think it is advisable, as requested by President Donald Tusk, that the European council should accept this extension. This extension will allow the United Kingdom to clarify its position and the European parliament to exercise its role. Donald Tusk, president of the European council, tweeted last night that he would recommend the EU27 accept the UK request for an extension. Here is a story from the Guardian\u2019s Brussels bureau chief, Daniel Boffey: The Irish taoiseach (prime minister), Leo Varadkar, has hinted that a Brexit extension to 31 January is the panacea to the latest impasse to hit Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. He spoke to the European council president, Donald Tusk, today and they \u201cnoted\u201d that an extension to the end of January would not prohibit an earlier departure from the bloc. The issue will be discussed at a key meeting in Brussels tonight. Here\u2019s the full statement from the Irish government: An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, spoke with the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, this morning regarding the UK\u2019s request for an extension. The Taoiseach confirmed his support for President Tusk\u2019s proposal to grant the request for an extension which was sought by the UK. They noted that it would still be possible for the UK to leave before January 31st 2020 if the Withdrawal Agreement has been ratified in advance of that date. The matter is likely to be discussed further at tonight\u2019s meeting of the Committee of Permanent Representatives in Brussels. More from Lisa O\u2019Carroll, who is watching Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith giving evidence at the Northern Ireland affairs committee. Anti-Brexit activist Gina Miller has been making the case for a general election \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Nigel Farage has told the BBC that a general election is now the \u201conly possible route to get some resolution\u201d. The Brexit party leader said: Obviously what they want is a general election or a second referendum - they want some degree of resolution. So I would have thought at least until the end of January, perhaps even longer. On an electoral pact, he said: I would work with anybody that wanted to honour the result of the referendum for us to leave the European Union and to leave its institutions and to be an independent country, but right at the moment that looks very unlikely. Guardian readers have reacted to last night\u2019s developments in the commons. \u201cThis may seal Boris\u2019s fate. The EU looks [prepared] to grant the extension now because there will be nothing to stop the vote of no confidence and a GE [general election],\u201d said one. \u201cThe outcome of that is obviously uncertain, but in this situation, risks have to be taken to try to avert catastrophe.\u201d Boris Johnson has issued a short statement about the 39 people who were found dead in a lorry container in Essex. Guardian Brexit correspondent, Lisa O\u2019Carroll, is following the Northern Ireland select committee. The Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith is giving evidence at the Northern Ireland affairs committee. He said the government would be doing anything they could make any checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK as \u201creduced and limited as possible\u201d. Smith said we now have a deal where Northern Ireland is out of the European Union. A reminder of what we have to look forward to in the commons today. Proceedings kick off with questions to the cabinet office minister Michael Gove at 11.30am, before prime minister\u2019s questions at midday. Since the progress of the withdrawal agreement bill has been paused, the queen\u2019s speech is back on the agenda. MPs will debate it this afternoon, with a special focus on the NHS. From the former chancellor \u2013 Good point here from the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour. Speaker John Bercow said he would stand down by 31 October. Former Conservative deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine has been speaking to Sky News. Asked whether he thought the Tories would win an election, he said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d The issue is can the Brexit aspect of the Tory party peel off enough Labour votes, enough Labour marginal constituencies, to counter the number that the Tories are going to lose. They are going to lose seats in Scotland and seats to the Lib Dems. I think they have alienated the Irish to such an extent that they won\u2019t come back and support them, so you can see quite clearly where the Tories are going to lose seats. And I know where they think they can win Labour seats, but when it comes to it that\u2019s a pretty big gamble. My own guess is that a general election will be a re-run of what we have today \u2013 another period of uncertainty. He said an election might put Johnson back in No 10, but without a majority. Here are the full Burgon quotes from Sky News \u2013 I\u2019d like to see an election before Christmas. I want to get Boris Johnson and his Thatcherite mates out of Downing Street as soon as possible. So as soon as the EU has agreed that extension, so that Boris Johnson cannot push us through a no-deal without a mandate to do so, then we want a general election. Not only to get Brexit sorted by under a Labour government putting it to a public vote between a credible leave option and remain, but also sorting out all the other crises that the Tories have caused in the last nine years in government, whether it be housing, jobs, public services or austerity. Former Conservative and now independent MP Ken Clarke has told BBC News that the narrative on last night\u2019s debate has been spun by \u201cthese strange people that Boris has put in Downing Street\u201d (aka Dominic Cummings). He said parliament voted by a clear majority in favour of leaving the European Union with a deal. \u201cThe only thing that was killed off was the idea that it had to be on halloween,\u201d he said. It\u2019s always been a mystery to me why that date has been given a sacred significance. It\u2019s a completely unimportant date. It was plucked out of the air last time the eurosceptics caused delay and stopped us leaving twice earlier this year and it has no significance. Clarke said that even ministers were still discovering yesterday what the deal in its present form actually means. He said the Brexit secretary found out yesterday that, as it stands, the deal requires customs documents for all goods that pass between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. \u201cThings like that have got to be sorted out,\u201d he said. \u201cParliament is not defying the people, it is just insisting that we have something that is sensible and works and is practical.\u201d Asked about the idea that \u201cparliament is broken\u201d, Clarke says: \u201cThis bloke in Downing Street (Cummings) keeps saying that. Even Boris has not said that ... The government has just got the second reading of its bill.\u201d Richard Burgon has been clear about Labour\u2019s position when speaking to Sky news. The Lord chancellor and justice secretary Robert Buckland has been speaking to Sky news. Asked why the government wouldn\u2019t just allow parliament to debate the withdrawal agreement bill for a bit, he says that the EU chose the 31 October deadline date and that we should respect that. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to give up and walk away and pretend that this is too difficult,\u201d he said. Labour\u2019s justice secretary Richard Burgon has been speaking to the BBC. He said more time was needed for the government and the opposition to discuss a sensible way forward. He refused to put an exact number of days on how long was needed to examine a withdrawal agreement bill, saying it didn\u2019t make a difference to people if it was debated for two or two and a half weeks. Burgon said it was the government who is allowing the matter to drag on \u2013 One of the reasons it\u2019s dragging on is because the government is putting a stop to the progression of the bill. The second reason was passed in parliament \u2013 though we voted against it \u2013 but the government isn\u2019t proceeding with it at the moment. They could be. So actually it\u2019s the government who are behaving in a strange way, not the other political parties. But we need to get this sorted. Burgon dodged the question of whether Labour would back an election if the EU granted the UK an extension. This is from ITV\u2019s political correspondent \u2013 Former attorney general Dominic Grieve has been speaking on Sky news. Grieve said that the fixed-term parliaments act 2011 \u2013 which makes it harder for a prime minister to call a general election at a time that is convenient for them \u2013 was a terrible piece of legislation, which he regrets. Former Tory culture secretary John Whittingdale, appearing on Sky just now, said he agreed with Grieve on the fixed-term parliaments act. He said that the 31 October deadline would probably be missed. I think Boris has pulled off an extraordinary achievement. Not only did he manage to get the EU to reopen the deal and make the changes necessary for people like me to support it, he then managed to get it through the House of Commons. Stephen Kinnock from Labour said that while he was open to voting for a deal, he couldn\u2019t vote for this one which \u201cwould make a bonfire of workers rights, environmental standards and consumer protection\u201d. He said that the prime minister should sit down with Corbyn and agree a sensible programme motion so the bill could be scrutinised and amended. \u201cI have huge respect for colleagues who too the decision to vote last night in the way that they did. It simply wasn\u2019t a deal I could support,\u201d he said. David Lidington, a former Tory Europe minister, was just on the BBC\u2019s Today programme. He said that the EU would want to ensure that they don\u2019t get blamed for a no-deal Brexit, so will offer an extension. He said the majority for the withdrawal agreement bill was bigger than most people had expected and that the government should propose a longer timetable to try and get it through parliament again. \u201cI see no way that the October 31st deadline can be met anyway now the bill has been paused in the commons,\u201d he said. I think the fear in Downing street is partly of rafts of amendments to the bill, but also about the difficulty of governing without a majority ... There are broader questions that underly the disputes about the timings of the Brexit bill Lidington said the most likely timing for an election was the end of November or early December, though he warned that the public would not welcome an election in the run-up to Christmas. It\u2019s Frances Perraudin here now, taking over from Kate Lyons. You can contact me on @fperraudin or below the line. An unpleasant start to the day for Lisa Nandy, Labour MP for Wigan. Peter Walker has this extremely helpful Q&amp;A in which he answers some key questions. The full article is here and a selection of answers are below: So what just happened? In brief: the bill seeking to put into law Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal was passed by MPs on its second reading, the initial opportunity that MPs have to vote on a bill. It passed by 329 votes to 299, the first time the Commons has formally approved a Brexit plan. However, only 20 minutes later, MPs rejected the government\u2019s so-called programme motion, which set out the accelerated timetable for the bill, by 308 votes in favour to 322 against. So what happens now? Under a backbench-instigated law intended to ward off a no-deal Brexit, Johnson wrote to the EU on Saturday to formally request a delay to departure until 31 January, despite the PM not wanting this to happen. Responding in the Commons, Johnson said he would \u201cpause this legislation\u201d and await information from the EU on a possible delay. In the interim, he said, no-deal preparations would be ramped up. For now, the bill is \u201cin limbo\u201d, Speaker John Bercow said, using what he said was the technical term. Is the bill getting pulled? Downing Street had strongly hinted this would be the response to losing the programme motion. However, this seems to have been a lever to pressure MPs into backing the motion. Speaking during the debate ahead of the votes, Johnson pledged he would pull the bill and seek an election in the event of a delay until January or longer. But he did not promise to do this in any circumstances, holding open the possibility of a brief delay being acceptable. After the vote, Johnson was similarly equivocal, saying: \u201cOne way or another, we will leave the EU with this deal.\u201d Does all this make a general election more likely? Probably. If the EU insists on a lengthy delay, which is put in place, Johnson could push for an election. Crucially, if an imminent no-deal Brexit was now averted, Labour would be expected to now back an election, making it happen. However, for all his protestations against a longer delay, the 30-vote majority for his Brexit deal could tempt Johnson into trying to push the bill through parliament before an election, allowing him to stand as the prime minister who delivered departure. What will MPs do for the rest of this week? On Wednesday and Thursday, when they should have been finishing off the stages of the WAB, they will instead return to debating the Queen\u2019s speech. Remember that? The government\u2019s planned legislative programme was presented on Monday last week, but the scheduled five-day debate was suspended for the WAB debate. It now comes back. But it\u2019s hard to beat the Sun\u2019s front page today. Most of today\u2019s papers \u2013 whose fronts pages we round up here \u2013 blame Parliament for the latest sting in the Brexit tale. Here is a selection: This from the Brexit coordinator for the European Parliament Hello and welcome to the politics blog, bringing you the latest out of Westminster and Brussels in the wake of Tuesday night\u2019s partial victory in the Commons for Boris Johnson. Here\u2019s a very brief summary of events to get you started: Donald Tusk has said he will recommend the EU 27 leaders accept Johnson\u2019s somewhat reluctant request for a Brexit extension. He made the request as soon as MPs rejected the PM\u2019s three-day timetable to push through his deal. Downing Street will have to decide whether to carry through with the PM\u2019s threat to abandon the bill and call for a general election in the event of a lengthy extension. Here is a video of his speech. Note: he dropped the threat after losing the second vote, but No 10 is still making noises about it in the event of an extension until January. However, an EU source said that if the bloc was to think again on the length of the extension then Johnson would need to make a second formal request for a shorter delay. Jeremy Corbyn has urged the government to agree to an alternative timetable, to allow the legislation to continue to be debated. I\u2019ll be gently steering us through these choppy news waters during the early hours before handing over to my esteemed and highly entertaining colleagues.
